If so, you will need to buy an allin one type remote. (preferably a Logitech Harmony One).All in all I gave this TV 5 Stars due to it's truly amazing picture quality and allthe excellent features and options it has.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy set up very clear picture in HD", "Author": "M.

I have been waiting for an LED-backlit TV with at least a true 120Hz refresh rate to come down to a decent price. On this past Black Friday weekend I tried the Samsung UN46ES6100 and this Sony KDL46EX645, which were both priced at $799. Below are my thoughts on these two TVs.Picture Quality: After having the Samsung TV and trying to tweak the picture settings to make it look just right, then still not being satisfied by the clarity, when I connected the Sony TV I was impressed at first sight. The sharpness of the Sony is much better, and the color balancing doesn't take much if any tweaking at all to make scenes look good. The Samsung had several white blotches in the middle are of the screen, which could've just been a defect in the model I got. (Best Buy sold it to me as \"new\" but it was obviously an \"open box\" item.) The Sony has some light \"ghosting\" in the corners, which is not a defect but is just the way it is for this edge-lit LED TV. This is somewhat distracting in dark scenes, but can be minimized by adjusting the backlight level.Motion Flow: I tested several fast-moving movie scenes on my Sony BDP-S390 on both TVs without any \"motion flow\" enabled. The Sony was much smoother on these scenes and decoded the scenes with less pixelation. With \"motion flow\" enabled, I found that the Samsung was not very good at \"guessing\" the fill frames, making the scenes much worse. On the Sony, the \"guessing\" was better but I don't like the \"soap opera\" feel that it creates so I leave it off except for sporting events. The Sony TV has a separate \"CineMotion\" option for movies, I have left that on although I haven't been able to tell a difference with it on or off.Smart TV: Sony's PlayStation experience has helped them in this area I think. The Sony Entertainment Network is quick and easy to navigate with a well-designed layout, and the TV is responsive and not bogged down when accessing it (although there is a short delay immediately after turning on the TV before you can access it). The Samsung equivalent was clunky and not designed well at all. The Sony TV also has \"Internet Apps\" powered by Yahoo that provides quick access to widgets like weather, stocks, and sports scores which I find very convenient. There is a decent Samsung equivalent for this, but you have to go through their Smart Hub to access it which interrupts TV viewing. On the Sony it is just one button away and shows up along the button of the screen.Menus and Remote Control: This is another area in which Sony showed their professional side and superior design. On the Samsung, the menu system was childish and basic. On the Sony it is clean-cut, extensive and easy to navigate. The remote is easy enough to use, and with the Bravia Sync menu we can control the Sony BD player using the TV remote. The TV sends the controls through the HDMI cable. Switching back to TV control does require pressing a few buttons, and accessing some of the deeper BD player controls requires accessing a menu system, but it is convenient to have control on one remote.TV Guide: We pickup OTA TV channels so we don't have a TV guide on a cable box. On the Samsung there was a very nice TV guide that showed us upcoming show schedules. The Sony doesn't have this feature, which is disappointing but not a deal breaker.Conclusion: The Sony has a better picture engine and the \"smart TV\" features are better. The overall impression I got when comparing the two models is that the Sony was made by professionals and the Samsung was made by amateurs. We've always owned Sony equipment so maybe I am just biased, or maybe they just make really good equipment. I realize that there are various price-levels and technologies for TVs, and the more expensive plasma TVs have the best picture quality. This 46\" EX645 was worth the wait for us to buy an LED HDTV.Star Rating: I think this is a great TV overall. I'm giving it 4 stars, taking off a star for the light \"ghosting\" in the corners and the lack of the TV guide. I think Sony could've easy included the TV guide, which even our old converter box had, but didn't for some reason.P.S. Sony makes great TVs and home entertainment equipment, Apple makes great computers and smartphones. Canon make great DSLR cameras. Samsung makes all these things and more, but in my experience none of them are that great.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent color accuracy & good black levels", "Author": "Mr. Robert A. Nelson \"lylesonbob\"", "ReviewID": "RPZM1KS548F8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The  Sony KDL60EX645 60\" smart HDTV displays the most natural color image of any TV I have ever viewed. However, this is dependent on the proper custom setup of the TV display (more details later). Once the picture settings have been adjusted, the TV image has great color accuracy, excellent detail and good black levels (though there is some unevenness in the display when the screen goes to black, it is better in this regard than most edge-lit HDTVs). I had no problems establishing the wireless internet connection with the TV and the various internet features it has seem to work well, though I have tried only a few of them. Netflix, for example, was easy to set up and use. This 2D smart HDTV has a sturdy, non-swivel base and looks very attractive on a TV stand. It is much less expensive than the 3D alternatives and delivers a great picture for the price.As I mentioned, the image requires adjustments to the picture settings to get the best results. I first tried the settings recommended on CNET and by a reviewer on Amazon, but found the results less than satisfactory: the image looked like the lighting came from a setting sun - too yellow/warm. After some tweaking, I was able to produce a most satisfactory DVD & Bluray image using the following settings:Home menu>Settings> Picture & Display--Picture Adjustments menu--Picture Mode: CustomBacklight: 3Picture: 95Brightness: 49Color: 43Hue: 0Sharpness: MinColor Temperature: NeutralNoise Reduction: OffMPEG Noise Reduction: OffMotionflow: OffCineMotion: Auto 1-Advanced Settings submenu-Adv.

The short version of this long review is that with minimal tweaking, this set avoids all those problems.Two months ago, I semi-retired my five-year-old 720p Olevia TV to a bedroom, and bought this Sony set. In that time, I've come across a bunch of quirks and head-scratchers. None that spoil the viewing experience, but let me just give them a quick mention so you'll know what to expect.- The sound is so-so. Anemic, and a bit harsh in the mids. I was expecting this; it's hard to put decent-sized speakers into a thin frame, so proverbial corners have to be cut. It's not a problem because I play the TV through my living room surround-sound system. In other words, connect the audio output of your set to an input on your amp or receiver (or to a good soundbar) and Bob's your uncle.- Sony's remote is pretty bad. It isn't backlit (OK, most remotes aren't). It's way too hard to distinguish top from bottom in the (semi-)dark after you pick it up. Also, the circular pad in the middle has an outer and an inner ring that are tricky to tell apart by feel, resulting in erroneous pushes. Plus, the most-used button is likely the volume control, and Sony has placed it near the very bottom. You have to do some advanced thumb acrobatics to find it, while almost losing the remote's balance. Ergonomics, anyone? On the plus side, I do like the one-touch Netflix button. Wish there were additional direct-access buttons, perhaps even ones you can program yourself.- As TVs are becoming more complicated, and networked, they are now a little more like computers, and they're no longer instant-on. This Sony set takes about eight seconds to show a source signal after you press the power button, then will not give you access to any networked services such as Netflix or Hulu for another 15-20 seconds. That's with a direct (wired) Ethernet connection; it might be a bit longer over wifi, I haven't tried. It's only a minor annoyance however.- Sony's built-in web browser is atrocious. In fact, I have a number of user-interface issues with this TV, starting with the asinine on-screen keyboard that mimics a telephone keypad; inputting search terms and the like is s-l-o-w. Luckily, I've only had to use it when signing into subscription services. The TV retains usernames and passwords so it's a one-time nuisance. The built-in Sony Entertainment Network is likewise hobbled by weird interface decisions and overall clunkiness. I don't use it.- The Hulu app experienced frequent freezes and crashes. I suppose I would muddle through it if I had to, but I have a $90 Apple TV box hooked up to the Sony, and prefer accessing HuluPlus through Apple TV, where it has been rock solid.- One final niggle: when you press the Netflix button on the Sony remote, you are taken to a screen that lets you choose between regular Netflix and Netflix for Kids. I wish I could automatically bypass this unnecessary (for me) choice. This choose-your-Netflix screen is also oddly fuzzy, probably 480p instead of the 1080p I expect from a hi-def TV. To be sure, once you're actually connected to Netflix, the picture is sharp and snappy.Ah, that picture. It is startlingly real-looking, smooth, and sumptuous. You can lose yourself in it. It is the reason I bought this TV (and paid a little more than I would have for competitors' models).Now, to be honest, I didn't like the image quality much right out of the box, as there was a cheap soap-opera look to everything I watched. But once I'd delved into the settings and turned off Motionflow, the picture was as rich and near-cinematic as I'd hoped. (One caveat: true black level isn't as good as you'd find on a plasma set, and I've occasionally seen posterization in the blacks from compressed sources such as Hulu's Criterion Collection.) Predictably, the (uncompressed) splendor that is Bluray really shows the TV off to its maximum benefit, but I'm overall also very pleased with the image quality I get out of Netflix, HuluPlus, Amazon Instant Video, and iTunes. Even standard-def fare looks rather good.Word of advice: Sony offers a lot of image tweaks in the settings. To get the best picture, you'd do well to go through them while playing a THX or similar test disc. (I found a nice little THX test program in the Extras menu of my DVD copy of The Incredibles, a bonus that must have been included on lots of other titles also -- check your own DVD library!)I haven't yet gotten used to how stellar the image is, and still feel almost giddy when I turn the set on and behold what's on the screen. Despite some misses and minuses in other departments, the Sony KDL46EX645 delivers the best picture I have yet seen in any recent sub-$2,000 TV monitor.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good picture, good service and delivery.", "Author": "full of flaver", "ReviewID": "RVNNCX8MVQ20F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to purchase this model about a week before Christmas.

UPDATE", "Author": "AnotherAmateur's Channel", "ReviewID": "R3EHE61PYAIHL6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We ordered this newly released model from Amazon directly.  The introductory price was hundreds below MRP.It arrived on the first day of the delivery window.Using our own f-connector (coaxial cable) got us up and running with cable TV channels.  You must supply your own cables.Set up was pretty easy, although the warning message tells you that searching for available channels may take 50+ minutes (ours took about 10 minutes).Picture quality was good.  Sound was also very good.However, the RCA connections from a VCR were defective.The Composite video connections from a DVD were defective.The H15 (VGA) input from a computer was defective.Nothing worked except for the tuner.There are a lot of HDMI inputs and USB inputs (located at the back of the unit and along the left edge).  Did not try them as the other electronics were kaput out of the box.Sony on-line support walked me through several diagnosis operations.  After about a hour the Sony tech determined that there was a serious electronic malfunction and the unit would require major repair.  He gave me a number to call to find out about shipping it to a repair/service center.Well, that would mean we paid full price for a NEW TV that would become a refurbished unit when Sony sent it back to us.  Not so good.Lucky us!  We had bought through Amazon and could take advantage of the great return policy at Amazon.  First time in all the years I've purchased from Amazon that I had to return anything (and it would be the biggest item I've ever ordered from them).  The return instructions were straightforward.  I took the TV stand apart and re-boxed everything in the original packaging and now we are waiting for the FedEx truck (see UPDATE).We opted to replace it with the same model.  It has WiFi and other features that we wanted.I agree that the remote is designed as a cash cow for Sony.  There are conveniently located, dedicated buttons for Netflix and Apps (Sony gets paid for product placement on the remote). Other commercial features are also right where your fingers naturally fall on the remote. If you want to use competitors of those brands it will be more difficult. But the buttons for volume, mute, channel up/down, and \"Jump\" (goes back to the previous channel) are about 1 inch from the very bottom of the controller where your fingers have trouble finding them without the controller falling off the arm of the old recliner.One strange feature on the remote is \"Wide\". It provides several ways to distort the screen image.  Not sure why...  We only use about 20% of the remote buttons and features.  The Favorites list is very useful for finding digital channels (211.1 or other five stroke addresses are available with just two or three strokes).UPDATE:  We got the new replacement TV from Amazon 24 hours after filling out the on-line return form.  Amazing service!  The new TV does seem to work well. VHS, DVD, Blueray, etc. can be watched. We have not used all of the many features such as Netflix, various colored buttons and HDMI ports, yet. And some interface features, though they sound cool, are really not very convenient to use.For example, setting up a direct WiFi connection to our home LAN router was very straightforward and simple. The manual tells you that Internet is as easy as typing in the URL of the webpage you want (we've only gotten the Sony browser to connect to the Sony product shopping website, for all URLs we typed in we get the message \"Cannot display that page\").  But the primitive way of entering text to type in a URL is very, very slow (have to use the remote control with each number assigned three or four characters that you then have to scroll though to select). The manual does note that it is possible to connect a USB mouse and keyboard to the TV.  Although Sony warns that not all USB mouses or keyboards may be compatible with the unit, it does not suggest which those are.I connected my Mac laptop to the H15 (SXGA) port at the back of the TV so that I could mirror the computer screen on the TV.  The manual only tells you that this is the connection to make.  But making the display work is not without some effort and imagination on your part.  After much fiddling I discovered that after the computer output is matched to the TV input resolution, you then must press \"Input\" on the remote controller and navigate to a screen where you can select the computer. Once you select the computer as an input device it works fine. We also were able to use the computer browser to connect to any Internet website we wanted instead of only to the Sony shopping page.  The displayed computer mirror image is not viewed as a full screen image on the TV.We had good luck with connecting a USB flash memory drive to the TV.  We plugged it in, followed the manual directions, and were watching photos and home movies in no time.  The clarity of the 1080p videos is stunning.This has not been an easy TV set to figure out.  Could be that we last bought a TV (a Sony) back in the 1990s and we are not familiar with the new ways of connecting to various features.  If you are buying it believing that the instruction manual will guide you though figuring out all of the many features, you may be surprised.The TV has very good picture and audio quality.No manufacturer is perfect all of the time with every product.  Eventually, we may even figure out how to navigate with the Sony Internet browser (if you know how to do that, please reply to this comment with directions).  Overall, we are pleased with this product -- it is a huge improvement over the antique 27\" CRT television set we previously used -- and we are very satisfied with the excellent service provided by Amazon.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "BEWARE!!!", "Author": "mbj2422", "ReviewID": "R3EA5K9WR9CWHV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would rate model KDL50EX645 less than 1 star if I could. I purchased the KDL50EX645 on Nov. 23, 2012, Black Friday at a SONY store. I have long wanted a SONY TV and I was delighted to have finally purchased one. I gave away an eight year old, 37\" Phillips, flat screen TV that was working perfectly. I just wanted a SONY. While the TV did not have as good a picture as expected, I was willing to live with the picture quality because I got what I thought was a good price. Now I know that I got less than I paid for.On Aug. 17, 2013 the TV would not turn on; less than one year from the date of purchase. I traveled out of town for a few days and returned to contact SONY support on Aug. 25. I was told that support was unable to open a reference ticket because of an IT upgrade that did not go as expected and I should call back on Tuesday, Aug 27. On Tuesday, I called twice and was told that support still could not open a reference ticket. I was instructed to call back on Thursday, Aug. 29. Instead,  I asked to escalate and was put through to Customer Relations who opened a reference ticket. I was told that the blinking red light indicated that I needed service. The part would be ordered to arrive in approximately 5 business days and a technician would be in touch to repair the TV. I indicated that I was not happy with this plan and I wanted to escalate. I was transferred to National Customer Relations (NCR). NCR stated that I would have to wait on repair and I insisted that the TV should be replaced since the TV was less than one year old. NCR finally admitted that the part needed for repair was on back order and they did not know when the part would be available. NCR then agreed to a replacement but the replacement would be with a refurbished unit and they would need my credit card number for this process. After careful consideration, I declined the refurbished unit because I purchased a new unit. My thinking is that a failed refurbished unit should be replaced with a refurbished unit. A failed new unit should be replaced with the same or similar new unit. After attempting to pressure me into accepting the refurbished unit, NCR finally agreed to a new discounted replacement because they no longer have the KDL50EX645 model in stock for replacement. I was told to chose carefully because the discounted TV from the website was my last option. I was instructed to select a TV that was 50 - 55 inches and it could not be a XBR or a 4K. There were 3 on the website that met the given criteria. I have an Internet TV and one was not an Internet TV so that left two choices. I was told that I would have to pay an additional $125 + tax for a replacement that was most comparable to mine. I would have to pay an additional $702 for an upgraded model.Under duress, I decided to take the comparable model for an additional $125 + tax. I was fearful that if I did not, I would lose the $900 that I have already paid for the non-working unit. I am at a lost as to why I need to pay anything for a comparable replacement. But for the fact that my TV stopped working, I would not have asked anything of SONY. Even for the replacement, it is concerning to me that the part needed for repair is on back order.I am horribly disappointed with this entire experience and have spent several hours on the phone trying to get resolution. SONY support would not respond to my email so I had no choice but to call. Each time, I had to explain my problem and troubleshooting measures before being transferred to National Customer Relations. I no longer have any level of confidence in SONY products or SONY support will not buy SONY products in the future.

The KDLEX645 and it's larger and smaller siblings should go a long way in restoring a little luster to the Sony brand. First of all there's the picture quality. It's simply brilliant, with deep saturated blacks and lifelike skin tones. It doesn't blow away the competition, like the old Trinitrons used to, but it's superior in a variety of subtle and intangible ways. The picture even improved somewhat after it had been up and running for about a week. This set includes all the Smart TV bells and whistles that you want and nothing that you don't want like 3D.

I was very happy with this TV until, after 8 months of ownership, it would not turn on.The story of Sony's handling of the repair through their \"customer relations\" department is long and painful.  The short story is that they have turned me and my wife into consumers that will avoid Sony in all future purchases, not because of their products but because of their customer service.The TV would not turn on.  Instead, I got a repeating series of 6 flashes from the red standby LED.  (This and the model number turned out to be the only things the repair people needed to know.)I contacted Sony support via the on-line chat line and told them about the 6 blinks.  They had me go through some troubleshooting steps which did not work and then advised me to contact Amazon and get the TV replaced since it was still under warranty.I then contacted Amazon, who said I had to deal with the \"seller\".  I contacted the seller and they said that since it had been longer than 30 days I had to go through Sony.  Sony support had to have known this was the case since I had told them I bought the TV 8 months ago but they made me waste a week contacting these other companies.Back on the Sony chat line they now directed me to \"customer relations\" which does not have an on-line interface or an email interface.  You have to contact them through a toll phone number.  When you call that number you go through a bunch of automated menus where every other message is a sales pitch for Sony.  Then when you finally get a real person you are subjected to a sales pitch for an extended warranty.  Then you find out there is just one more bit of information they need before they can handle the repair and you have to make the toll call again when you get the information.  After two more calls the last bit of information was a sales receipt.  They needed it to be faxed (since email was impossible) and gave me a number that did not work.  When I dialed the number with my phone I could hear a fax signal but when I tried to use a fax machine it would not connect.  After four attempts my wife tried FedEx and they couldn't connect either.  My wife called customer relations and demanded to talk to a supervisor.  Frustrated to tears because the supervisor could not offer any suggestions beyond retrying the fax, my wife took it upon herself to initiate a conference call between Sony and Amazon to get the proof that we bought the TV.  After that we were referred to a local TV repair company and they fixed the TV.So in summary Sony's customer service will attempt to divert you as long as possible.  They will only offer an interface via a toll number and they will make you call that number multiple times subjecting you to sales pitches every time.  They will put up roadblocks like a non-functioning fax number and offer no alternatives.  You will have to be prepared to bump the issues up to supervisor level and offer your own alternatives to the roadblocks.

Its a Sony and you can be rest assured about the quality of the product.Here's my observation.Stand: I don't really care as I wall mounted it.Internet and SEN: Yes the SEN is a bit slow compared to other internet Tvs.. but for me I have a Ps3 and an Apple Tv , both of which have Apps and I have a receiver which feeds the devices into the TV and sound system.So I do not really use the internet on the TV.Bulky: Yes the Tv is a bit bulky compared to competitors but its ok you are not going to lift it daily.My chettah mount is holding it very well.3D: 3D is good to have but then its a personal choice.. 3D hasnt really evolved for us to take full advantage of it.Now the real thing:PICTURE: The picture is very real and crisp. I can see the real color of humans which you wont find in many latest models these days.I turned of the motion control and did some calibration based on some forums and was able to get the best pic.SPOTLIGHTING: Heres the bad new.. I can see spotlighting( A ray of light at the corners n edges). Especially during dark scenes ..I bothers me even more cause I am in literal 0 light room and I tend to be more Anal about few things.I do not see this being an issue in a room decently lit.The blacks are very good though except for the spotlighting.Not sure if it is inherent to edge lit Tvs. I will be calling the SONY support to get some help.Lets see what they say.Will give an update on spotlighting soon.If you are in the market for a quality TV with one of the best pics this is the one to go with.Thanks", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable!!", "Author": "Alexandria", "ReviewID": "R1XCAEJAFP374Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this tv in time for the SEC championship....it makes no sense how great everything looked!

Of course the replacement is refurbished, and an older model, but we were just happy to have a TV that would work. How wrong we were.Our next TV lasted 3 months. During that time it would randomly turn off. Occasionally the screen would be pink when it turned back on.

This TV is an upgrade from a 40-inch 720p Samsung LCD that died last week.  My first impression was that the Sony was much more elegant and minimalist in design.  This is not surprising -- the trend is to thinner TV's and LED's especially so.  Even though the screen is 10 inches bigger, the overall case of the TV was not all that much larger than the older Samsung.  The \"frame\" around the screen is thinner than the old TV.  It's a very nice design that looks great on the wall.  Very easy to mount on my existing wall mounting bracket.The menus could stand to be a little more intuitive.  There are several ways to access the same function, which may not be a bad thing, but can leave me feeling like I'm going in circles when I explore for new features and end up at the menu I just left.Picture is very nice.  I am not a real-deal videophile, so I don't speak the real language of a TV reviewer on this front, but I am very observant and pretty picky about the picture.  My overall impression is that the Samsung was just somehow brighter than this TV.  Especially when playing BluRay's in Cinema mode, I found myself searching for ways to brighten the picture.  Cinema mode itself does not seem to offer any way to make color or brightness adjustments, and the only option is to change from Cinema mode to \"Standard\" or \"Automatic.\"  Both of these kick in the 240 response rate and smoothing effects, which gives the movie the soap opera effect -- yuck.  The solution I found was to go to the BluRay player itself and set it to its \"bright room\" setting.  This added the brightness I wanted in Cinema mode and made the picture absolutely beautiful.  Honestly, after that slight adjustment, I have been pretty giddy about how beautiful the picture is playing BluRay movies.The picture when TV viewing is very nice.  The TV has an option to view in standard or \"Vibrant\" mode.  Vibrant mode is brighter, but just seems to over-saturate the colors, so I have kept to standard for most everything.  Again, it's a little less bright than the Samsung and the picture seems a little softer, but that's growing on me.  The motion smoothing effects seem to work well for regular TV viewing.  I have not yet watched any sports, so I will see what I think after watching a college bowl game tonight.  The picture on Netflix needed adjusting because of the soap opera effect, but that was easy enough to fix by turning off some of the bells and whistles in the picture menu.Smart TV features are a mixed bag.  I hard wired the connection with a network cable to my router, so the wireless issues some have mentioned are not an issue for me.  (If possible, get a long network cable, chase it through the attic, drop it to your router.  You'll be happier with the streaming.)  The Sony Entertainment Network menu is easy to navigate and streams Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu Plus, YouTube, and Pandora, along with many, many others I had never heard of.  I was pretty familiar with all of these from my Sony BluRay player, so no surprises here.  The menu is easy to navigate and it all works well.  The Yahoo apps and widgets, on the other hand, are a nightmare.  Maybe I will figure these out eventually, but now all I can say is, \"huh?\".  Truly not intuitive.The remote is fine -- no frills and easy to use.  The dedicated Netflix button on the remote is kind of cool -- my kids really like it.  As a bonus, it operates the basic features of my Sony BluRay player, so it has cut down on our \"find the remotes\" angst.  It really could use a qwerty keyboard or access to the iPhone remote app.  Come on, Sony.  Is that to much to ask?Sound is really pretty good.  I almost always run the sound through my receiver and surround speakers by means of an optical out cable, but when I have used the TV sound, it has been fine.  No reservations on this front.In all, I love it.  I think I will learn a few more nuances of its operation over the next week or so, and I expect that this will only help me love it more.

I have had enough time watching it over different types of programs to finally perform my review.First off, like many other reviews, you will probably want to turn off the motion flow. It does make the scenes look a little strange, but sometimes, its fun to enable and see how things work. I watched Star Wars and Jumanji with these enabled and my ten year old thought it was like watching a movie she had never seen before. I didn't dislike this effect as many others, but I like watching what I should be watching, not what the tv is guessing I should be watching.You will need to do a little work to find the right picture for your tv set. I was watching Thor this weekend, granted a very dark movie in several different spots, and the general setting was not cutting it. The next day I changed to Cinema setting, and it was like watching a different movie. Don't be afraid to tinker with settings.The picture itself is very good. Nothing blows me away about it, and I enjoy my Panasonic Plasma tv I bought 3 years ago better, but I got a good deal on the TV and I feel it is better than others in its price area. I did a lot of research on tvs, and for hdmi ports and several other things, this tv beat out others in its mid-range category.The remote that comes with the TV is not backlit but it does have a lot of very easy to use buttons. I could do without the Sony Entertainment button on my remote. Like many others have complained, having the volume button on the remote at the bottom corner was not very smart, but options to change scene setting and other options are easy to locate.The two things that really irk me about this tv are the stand and the \"smart\" portion of the TV. If you are buying this TV to have a smart TV and surf the internet, DO NOT BOTHER. It is completely useless. You might as well buy a laptop from 1996 because that would probably have a better processor. When I purchased this TV, I also bought a Sony Blu Ray player with internet options. I can connect to Netflix and the internet very easily on the blu ray player. I had it connected to another tv and I uploaded videos very quickly and never once had the video interupted. When I hooked it up to Sony tv, again, no issues. When I tried to connect to netflix on the TV instead, it was a nightmare. It could not play a video on you tube or Netflix without streaming and trying to reconnect over and over. Its embarrassing really that a company would release a product that works this poorly. How does a dvd player have a better ability to connect to the internet over an $899 television from the same company? I was on the phone with Sony support for over two hours trying to figure out the problem, but if you surf thru the reviews on here enough, you will see that it is a common error and nothing can be done. I would have returned the TV for other options $100 cheaper and 5 inches bigger, but they only had 2 hdmi ports on all of those tvs. Basically, you are buying this tv for the extra hdmi ports.Also, the stand that comes with this tv is very low quality and crappy.

I fixed it by turning off CineMotion and MotionFlow but the problem persisted in Netflix. It was so annoying. Everything looked like a bad soap opera. I was quite shocked, as are a lot of other reviewers, that Sony had no fix for the problem. I soon learned that if you access the Picture settings while a Netflix program is actually playing, they are different from when the TV is working off the cable. So you have to set the CineMotion/MotionFlow to off every time you open Netflix. This is kind of annoying and I'm hoping future TVs or even Netflix will have a fix for this. But at least, after weeks of internet surfing, I found the solution. Why aren't more movie producers mad about this issue? It makes their movies look like bad home videos.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stellar picture", "Author": "katana \"techie\"", "ReviewID": "R1L3HDAXAHU38K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read up on LED illuminated LCD TVs and associated reviews, and finally, after seeing this one in person at the local Best Buy, bought it. It was brighter, and more colorful than other similar TVs next to it, and was on sale at less than half MSRP. Plus, SquareTrade had sent me a coupon for 30% off of a 4-year warranty, so I got that too, at over $125 less than the equivalent warranty at Best Buy.Once I had it set up at home, I watched several different things in 1080P from HDMI sources, including a live baseball game and some Blu-ray discs, and the colors were excessively bright, and the \"soap opera effect\" was really annoying. How then can this be a 5-star review, you ask? Read on.Once I dug into the settings, disabled any automatic picture adjustment features, reduced the \"Motion Flow\" setting from high to medium, changed the color temperature to \"neutral\" and used a test pattern DVD to calibrate the white and black level, sharpness, color saturation and hue, the picture just blew me away. A nice bonus is a \"lock screen settings\" function that prevents casual adjustment of the picture by family or guests ruining the calibration I took time to perform. I have seen a lot of TVs like this in a lot of different situations, and this is hands-down the best I have seen. The side-lit LED backlight allows for a much better black level than what you get with CCFL, and so far, even on very dark scenes on Blu-ray discs, I have not seen any of the \"flashlighting\" mentioned by other reviewers. The black level is not as deep as a plasma, but the picture is every bit as colorful, and a lot brighter than what you can get from a plasma. I wouldn't push a plasma set to full brightness anyway due to the burn-in issues that they are susceptible to. LED/LCD TVs are immune to this phenomenon.I was concerned by the few one-star and two-star ratings I saw here, but some seemed to be aimed more towards Sony's customer service than the product itself, and some might have been due to defects from the factory - nothing is perfect. I am prepared to return the set to Best Buy if any issues come up in the first 60 days, but I really don't feel I need to worry.I have another Sony LCD, but it is an older CCFL-based 40\" capable of 1080P, and let me tell you what - when I go from watching this set directly to the 40\" set, I notice every little picture deficit it has magnified by comparison. The funny thing is that this 60\" TV has a thinner profile than my old 40\" one.Based on this experience, I would happily recommend this set to others. Time will tell if it is as durable as my older LCD TV, which is several years old, and has given me no issues whatsoever. The picture on this set rivals that of \"high-end\" sets I have spent time watching, at a fraction of the cost.Things to note about this set and my review:- The TV is not 3D capable - I don't watch 3D TV or movies due to the headaches and dizziness they cause me, so I didn't want to waste my money on something useless to me- I have not used, and cannot comment on, any of the \"smart\" features on this TV because those are already available to me on my Blu-ray players- Likewise, I have a surround sound system and amplifiers, so I have not used the built-in speakers, and cannot comment on the sound this TV provides.

I don't see how the video could be any better. I haven't even done any \"fine tuning\" with the settings. The sound is quite acceptable for most viewing. When I want to watch movies, I feed the audio to my home entertainment system for a richer audio experience. As for the Web feature, I have found that it is plenty fast enough for my browsing and watching videos, although entering information, such as Website addresses, user IDs and passwords, is awkward, even with a wireless keyboard and mouse. I suspect that all of the various makes of HDTVs with the Web feature will disappoint if the goal is to replace a PC. However, I consider that feature of minor importance.I mounted the TV in the room above our garage and selected the VideoSecu MF607B1QH for the wall mount.

Not really needing 3D, I wanted the realiability and features of Sony without a huge price.  This TV has incredible picture and even really good sound.  Regular SD cable is fine, but HD signals like the PS3 games are beautiful.  Even the Wii hooked up through and HDMI converter looks great.  With the Sony HT-CT150 soundbar hooked up, who needs home theater?  And the \"coolest\" feature is that by pressing the PS button on the PS3 controller, the whole set up starts up by itself.  I am overall very happy with the set, but I did note the following issues related to mounting the TV (ignore if just using the base stand):Issue #1) The wall mount bracket holes are larger than the stand holes and require separate bolts.  Sony wants you to buy their own wall mount bracket with their own bolts, but I already had a TV stand with mounting post and bracket that I wanted to use and was not about to buy Sony's bracket just for the bolts.  This is really lame on Sony's part - the stand and wall mount holes and bolts should be the same.  I had to dig into my stash of old bolts in the workshop, and fortunately found 4 plus washers and lock nuts.  I had to cut off the bolts so they only went in as far as the holes allowed, but I was able to attach the hangers for the TV stand mounting bracket.Issue #2)  After all the effort to get the mounting bracket hangers attached, I found that the placement of the HDMI and coax inputs on the back was too far from the mounting holes and the inputs were directly behind the rectangular mounting bracket from the TV stand.  All 3 rear HDMI inputs and the coax input for cable TV are stacked vertically, so if one gets blocked they all get blocked.  My only solution was to use wood shims to keep the TV as far from the mounting bracket as possible and 90-degree connectors for one HDMI and the coax.  Now the other 2 rear HDMI inputs are completely blocked (leaving port #2 open on the side).  Fortunately I am running all HDMI inputs through the HT-CT150 sub woofer (like a receiver), so I only need the one HDMI on the back.  I've seen this input placement issue with other HDTVs, and the makers really need to get their act together and come up with a standard so that wall mount hangers/brackets and inputs never conflict.I have no issues recommending this to others.

The purchase was actually through Hexparts.com and the TV was described as \"Brand New Open box, unit is new and all accessories are sealed and untouched.\"  I would not have bought a USED TV.  When I turned it on the night of October 21, it would not power up and all the diagnostics and efforts have not changed that. Sony is saying I don't have a warranty because the words \"Used - like new\" appear on the invoice, so they view it as used and having no warranty.

Here's my impressions:Setup - very easy, the instruction manual is pretty clear and the menus are intuitive.Remote - I really didn't use this after initial setup. Only issue was the arrow keys are a bit small and too close to other buttons, so it's easy to hit something else on accident.Connections - plenty of HDMI ports (4), and just about everything else. Keep in mind that if you are using a wall mount, you are going to want at least three inches off the wall if you are using the back HDMI ports. Also if you plan on connecting your computer using DVI, you will need a DVI to HDMI adaptor. Also, optical audio will not work on devices that use an HDMI connection, as I found out. I'm not sure why, but apparently this happens with other brands as well. I just used component for my soundbar, but someone who is an audiophile would probably notice the difference. If you activate another connection (for example turning on a console) it will automatically switch to that input, and switch back when it turns off, which is a nice little touch.Smart TV - the wireless was easy to setup. I found the Netflix app was not as good as the PS3 version - it seemed the text was not as clear on menus, and the video was a bit choppy. I had no such issue using the PS3 version. The youtube app is quite convenient, as you can \"pair\" it with your computer to easily play youtube vids from your home computer on the tv. There are a wide range of other applications, which is nice if you don't have another media device (roku, console, etc.) already hooked up. I can't comment on the quality of the other apps besides netflix and youtube.Sound - I used my own soundbar, so I can't comment, but I had no real issues setting up the audio once I realized I couldn't use optical.Display - Coming from my old tv, the display was a big improvement. I watched my only Blu-Ray (Alien) and I was amazed at how crisp and clear it was - no graininess whatsoever. One stuck pixel (red) did develop on the bottom left of the screen after a few days, and I've not been able to remove it. However this seems to be a common issue with HDTVs.Overall I'm very happy with the tv.

Black levels are very good for an LED TV. Its not plasma black, but deep. The motion flow is just kind of weird. It is only for sports. It takes some tweaking to get the picture just right for the viewer. Stock was way to vivid, contrast was way too high and brightness made my eyes hurt. Viewing angle is very good, but the reflection can be seen at certain times of day in my living room. (that is my problem) Delivery of the product was by Eagle and they did an outstanding job. My wife was the only one home at the time they arrived and they hooked it up, and made sure it came on and video played. Can't ask for more.

The box arrived a little damaged, however serves me right for using super saver shipping. Assembly was extremely simple and although its recommended that you need two people I was able to do it myself.The TV is really thin and unexpectedly light. Initial setup was a breeze and it updated the software when I turned it on the second time. Ports were ample and I love that they have a few HDMI on the side so done need to look behind the TV for stuff I change up often. Picture quality was also great, and i found the preset color and scene options were adequate for me. The wireless connectivity means you dont need to run LAN cables around your house and it syncs with DLNA certified devices very easily.Although the TV as a TV is great the smart features are really not that smart. Options are similar to most other TVs on the market, but I find myself not using them at all. The borwser is a good feature, but does not have flash (which I was hoping it would) but then no other TVs support flash in their native browsers. You an attach a mouse that works well with the browser, but i have not had any luck with a wireless keyboard which i was hoping to use.The nice features are Hulu Plus, Pandora, and Netflix. Pandora and Hulu are in the Sony entertainment Network apps and there is a dedicated Netflix button the remote itself (nice if you netflix, but cant reprogram it for hulu plus, or any other survive). The so called internet apps (which also have a dedicated button on the remote) are supplied by Yahoo, which means they are seriously limited and not useful to me at all other than the weather app.One challenge with the Sony remote is that the volume and channel buttons are all the way at the bottom and I always prefer them to to be in the center of the remote (personal choice)Although, it might seem like a negative review, the TV was really great as a TV and it has all the bells and whistles, but i rarely find myself not using them as much as I would have anticipated.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it!", "Author": "Sewracc", "ReviewID": "ROQPWEEQ8SBRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this TV a lot.

The picture quality is stunning for the price range. It is not 3D, but I don't care. The 3D sets in this price category were below par picture quality. I liked the fact that Sony retained all connectivity including the VGA 15 pin PC connector (if your poor old PC or work laptop did not have HDMI). The sound output is not so great, but it is expected that you would add on some audio component, a sound bar, cinemate or a full 5.1 surround with a sub-woofer - to complement the tiny TV speakers.The best part is the picture quality I get on a 46 inch screen, it is definitely superior to many in this price range and can give some higher priced models a run for money.With the Black Friday week price tag of $799 from a Sony retail store and a corporate program discount, I got it home for $629 + taxes from my nearest Sony store. That was sweet.Now the cons, as you guessed it is not perfect. It has wi-fi bulit in and internet enabled. It is smart and easy to start with, but not so smart and not so user friendly as you go along. Typing anything is a pain and it is NOT compatible to Sony's Media Remote app yet (irrespective of what the salesman tells you). So you don't get to use your smart-phone as a keyboard or pointing device. It does not support skype, and even if it did, you have to shell out $150 for a OEM skype add on camera and mic. You thought of plugging in your existing webcam to USB - that may not work. The internet capability of this device leaves much to be desired as possibilities are infinity. You are tied down to what comes out of box and pray for a firmware / software upgrade to make it better. It is NOT a iOS or Android like platform where you can add apps form market place to do what you want. That may be couple of years wait (or less).Till then you can sit back and relax, enjoying the wonderful picture (plus the wonderful sound you choose to add on) it delivers from a HD cable/satellite box, your Blu Ray player, home DLNA sources or just internet video streaming with HD clarity from Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and other popular sources today.

Picture is sharp and bright, screen and inputs all seem to work,  lots of different inputs for different video sources. Clean, minimal design -- screen is paramount, not much plastic or other nonsense around the edges.Here are my objections.  You may consider them quibbles.1.  The back of the TV has a small outward curve/bulge at the bottom.  This meant that for my TV mount, which is like many others, I had to use spacers at the top to make the back level.  Result:  The TV is about 3/4\" of an inch further off the wall that it would have needed to be if the back were completely flat.  You can probably avoid this problem if you can find a mount that doesn't go very far down the back of the TV.2.  The built in Web browser is a joke.  It doesn't recognize Flash or many other types of video, so if you find a free movie online, you will get messages like \"mime type not recognized.\"  Even video that plays on my iPhone (which also doesn't have Flash) won't play on this computer.  Why even bother putting a browser like this on a TV?3.  The default home page of the browser is the Sony web site.  Not a portal or search engine, just a corporate site.  I have not been able to find any way to change this.  **If you know how please tell me.**  Worse, it leads to a *dead page* on the Sony corporate site!  So every time you turn on the browser, you get a Sony page with an error message.  You then have to find the bookmarks menu and go someplace more useful, like Google.4.  The browser is impossible to navigate with the remote control.  It's probably worse than a telegraph at entering numbers and letters.  There is no way to use a mouse or keyboard.  Without a decent input device, an Internet TV is kind of silly.5.  The TV is not very compatible with my home network.  I have yet to get it to recognize any of the audio or video files on disks shared with my ethernet network.6.  In fairness, the TV seems to be designed to work well with Hulu, Netflix, other designated sources.  Unfortunately, they have placed a button for these services -- the Sony Entertainment Network -- at 12 noon on the ring around the enter botton, where I click on it far too often by accident.  Combined with the Sony logo that fills the screen every time you turn on the TV (this feature, at least, can be turned off), it's like having a giant, high resolution billboard in your home.So, my misgivings:  Given the uselessness of the Internet connectivity, I am wishing I had bought a similarly good TV without Internet and used the savings to purchase an add-on Apple TV box, which might have worked better at a lot of things.  Or I could have just skipped that and connected a laptop computer with HDMI for connection to online content.  (Sadly, there is no way to connect wirelessly to this model.  Sony  makes much more expensive models that claim to have that capability.)  And I'm also wishing that I had dealt with the bulge on the back by buying either a different wall mount or a different TV.Having said all that, it's a beautiful TV, and if you're not mounting it on a wall and you only want the Internet to watch, say, Netflix, it's probably fine.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good picture but worthless internet", "Author": "Lan T.

I had to go through several sony product pages to type something. Then it takes forever to load a page. Very very slow over WIFI. Basically I gave up. I don't understand why. Sony is not apparently a good player in the internet, even with its product registration and account,etc.. The keyboard page is basically bad compared to even LG.

They were able to pull up my ticket number from my prior call history and I was told that my complaint would be forwarded up the chain of command. I might add that they were unsympathetic with my problem and were worried more about how I got their telephone number. I have not heard back from Sony and I don't think I ever will. I did return to pick up my set from the repair shop and was told that they used to carry Sony products but stopped carrying their brand as customers have had countless problems with them.

Their products were always made in Japan and I could count on the workmanship.  It had been about 7 years since I purchased a piece of electronic equipment so I was quite surprised when hooking the tv up to see \"Made in Mexico\" on the product tag on the back of the set.  Well, I guess I will know better next time.The Television does have a very good picture and so far no problems.

There isn't a separate listing for it that I could find.  This TV worked OK for 14 months.  The features were nice, we used Netflix a lot.  The Sony browser pretty much sucked.  The sound was poor, but thats to be xpected on a Sony TV and since most TV's today  direct the sound out the back.  We bought the HTCT-260 Sound bar to go with it.After 14 months I went to turn it on and the light flashes green, then jumps over to another light that flashes red 6 times. I tried researching it but didn't come up with much.  For other models the 6 flashes is the backlight or inverter.  It might be something I can fix myself if I knew what parts it was.  Otherwise I need to call a repair company.Not the kind of quality i expected from Sony.  I had a $1400 Vizio die after 4 years, I wasn't surprised but a $1000 Sony crashing after 1 year is bad news.It will probably sit in my storage room with the Vizio and we will use the 32 Samsung for awhile.I should just give up on TV's, I'd be better off...Updated 6/5/2014I took it to a local authorized sony repair shop.

They always cost 33% more, but the high quality and reliability was worth it.  That time is over and their quality has plummeted - although they still cost 33% more.I had the first TV less than 1 month, when one day it would not turn on.  Amazon quickly replaced with a new TV.Approximately 3 months later, the audio for HDMI 1 went out.  It would decode the video, but no audio.  Whatever, I just switched to a different HDMI input and all was well.Over the next few months, it had a few annoying quirks.  It would some times not turn off, either by the remote or the power button on the TV.  By unplugging and plugging in the TV, that issue would get resolved.  Hasn't done it for a while, so who knows.Now starting about a month ago, it is getting dead horizontal lines across the screen, seperated by ~1 cm or so.  Initially it was just 1 line every cm, but now it is 2 lines each cm and getting worse.  This does it on just the built in sony menu screens, so it is not my cabling or equipment.  The screen is simply going bad.The TV is now 1.5 years old and out of warranty.  I am going to contact Sony and see if they will help me with this, but I am sure they will say it is out of warranty and needs a new screen (at over $1000)...

Had originally purchased a 60\" Samsung but found that unit to be to large for the space.  Returned the Samsung and purchased the Sony.  I've had the unit for over a year so I have some experience with it.  Picture and sound are great...as expected.  Setup was performed without much trouble.  Access to remote programming via wireless connection went reasonably well but the remote control unit tried to sabotage that effort along the way.  The remote control unit has a central button that directs on-screen setup and search activities.  Outside of this central button is a ring that selects operating modes.  If you are using the central button and stray a little south of it, by pressing the ring you exit that program and go into some other mode.  Not normally a big deal but the means of introducing text to the operation is via that central button.  It is the clumsiest method I have ever experience.  Compared with my earlier Samsung, it's the difference between grunts and the spoken word.  The remote has one other 'feature'.  If you select a channel, say 71, then move to 75 using the channel button, pressing the channel return puts you back to 71, not 74, the channel you last visited.  Also, assume you are on channel 71, used the channel button to get to 75, then explicitly select 25.  Using channel return gets you to 71, using it again moves you to 25.  You never get back to 75, the last channel you were on prior to hitting 25.  In truth, I have not tried to contact Sony to see if this is a repairable quirk nor have I contacted them about the remote control in general.  Perhaps there is a solution.  If you are looking to watch regular programming or have a cable box, this Sony is great.  If you are looking to use the remote control to select channel or, worse yet, plan on accessing programming via the Internet, go with a different manufacturer.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "Cliftonian Institute", "ReviewID": "RA77MC05T1GSM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is an outstanding product.

We did quite a bit of research on different brands before purchasing this model (KDL46EX645), and our last flat-screen was a Sony as well.  Although I feel you do pay a bit more for a Sony name, the picture clarity is pretty amazing.  Some things to note:1.  We calibrated the colors and settings per the CNET recommendations (see other reviews here on Amazon for exact settings).2.  I turned the MotionPlus feature off to avoid the \"soap opera\" effect.  It almost feels like it adds a fake \"depth\" feeling to the screen, and it's rather unsettling to watch unless you're watching sports.3.  The Smart TV features and apps appear very easy to use.  So far, we've just used Amazon Prime, but the picture with the streaming video is almost better than our DirecTV HD feed!4.  The glossiness (reflectiveness) is similar to other brands that we viewed in the store.  It's a little more shiny than our older Sony Bravia, but it's really not that bothersome.

Here are a few points which I'd like to mention:1. Lots of apps: The number of apps supported is pretty good but the interface which is common to a lot of them is very primitive and seems like what is probably easy to program on using whatever Sony offers to the developers. Few popular apps have a better interface to them namely YouTube and Netflix.What I'm disappointed with is that it seems like there's not a lot of active development for this TV and I don't think there has been an update pushed since I first installed it.Amazon Instant Video: what's most disappointing is the lack of subtitle support. I don't know how they expect their customers to watch any foreign language movies. The tiny screen on iPhone supports subtitles but the 50 inch TV doesn't.2. Yahoo connected TV: This TV come with something called Yahoo connected TV on it which I don't find useful at all and for which it seems yahoo itself has a very outdated and meagre website.3.

Took delivery on 12/5/12 (due to my schedule - not the delivery service) via Amazon's white glove service (basically, they unbox the TV and inspect / turn it on to make sure it works.  They will also set it up for you and take the box with them).  I opted not to have them set it up since I was going to mount it on the wall and was also waiting for some other AV equiptment to come in.  We simply unplugged it and re-boxed it.After re-doing our basement, I bought the biggest TV to fit the space we allocated for a TV.  We planned to mount it on the wall, so we installed plywood in the wall to support the mount recommended for this TV.  We also install conduit behind the wall to pull cable, HDMI cables, optical cables, etc.The picture on the TV is clear and crisp.  The set up was easy with the on screen guide.  The TV recognized and picked up our wifi with ease (althought I switched this to a direct ethernet connection to our network.There are plenty of Apps available.  So far, I have connected to Pandora and Amazon Prime.The HDMI control (when turned on) switches to the AV receiver when it is turned on.  (I turned the HDMI control off because sometimes I prefer to have sports showing on the TV while listening to something else through the AV receiver.* I hooked the Cox cable direct to the TV sinced Cox cable has digital channels through the regular cable (we opted not to install a digital box for this location).* Then, hooked the TV (via optical cable) back to the AV receiver.  (This way when things are directly connected to the TV, the sound can also be played back through the AV receiver and surround sound.)* Then, connected the AV receiver via HDMI back up to the TV.  (This way when playing a device connected to the AV receiver (Bluray / DVD / VCR / Wii), they play back through the receiver to the TV.)The TV has ample HDMI connections available.  I do wish it had one more set of legacy connections for older products.  However, I was able to connect everything through the receiver.  So it ended up not being a big deal.I opted for another Sony product after reading and researching many other brands because I have had better experience with them versus Samsung.  We have a 46 inch 3D Sony in another room that we had bought after returning a Samsung 3D TV that would not hold a picture (it kind of had a mind of its own).  The picture and performance of the 3D Sony has been awesome.  We did not need or want another 3D TV, so we went with this model for our basement media room.I have not played with the picture settings yet as we are still trying everything out.  However, the settings out of the box seem to be pretty good.This is the first TV we have bought from Amazon.  I was a bit nervous about that, but after going through the process, I would do it again.  I did buy the 4 year canopy protection plan as well (hopefully we will not need to use it).", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "OUTSTANDING!! WOW!!

I chose this television after seeing it in the store first and then I read the reviews.  Finally decided to open the box and put it together a couple days after Christmas.  Setup was pretty easy, followed the instructions to include setting up the internet.  I had the assistance of my wife to help with the internet because that's her specialty in the military.  The first thing you notice is the high quality of the picture and the HD channels are even more defined. The sound is alright for just tv speakers. But once I hooked up my home theater system and the PS3 and BAM everything was just gravy from that moment on. The sound was fantastic using the hts.  I haven't used the internet other than to make sure that the Netflix application did work just fine.  I did have to speak with Sony online rep to fine tune my hts hookup.  If I had to say anything bad about this television is although I replaced a 50\" tv with another.  The Sony doesn't sit as high as my Samsung did however in terms of picture quality the Sony television is the clear choice winner. I've been enjoying television for about 4 days.

The Setup was a little bit long although straight forward. The first time I saw the picture I was overwhelmed with the quality, clarity, richness and vivid colors... WOW!! you feel you want to dive into the screen!! Absolutely amazing!! Since then I got the pleasant surprise of exreriencing the same WOW with every HD movie I see. The dark levels are dark, the white is white (a little discoloration where the LEDs are in extremely white scenes) bottom line is - Absolutely success, the greatest TV I have ever owned!The Wifi feature however - Useless!! I saw it right from the beginning. The idea behind it is nice but the reality is sad. I tried to stream some movies throgh amazon / netflix and it didn't survive more than 15 seconds without the annoying 'retreiving' message and the endless stops during the movie. First I checked my internet connection (24 MBPS) and it was fine. No problems streaming with my Roku as well. So next I tried to resetup the TV, there isn't too much you can do.Eventually, about 5 days later the TV just didn't recognize the built in Wifi adapter anymore and then I understood there might be a hardware problem.I contacted Amazon and they offered me some alternatives for this TV because it was out of stock. I decided to wait a bit to see if it comes back to stock within my exchange eligibility period and it did so I called them again and Immediately I got an exchange that I expect to receive tomorrow. Although it's not part of the TV review, it is intended to reassure everyone that Amazon is a safe buy.Thanks for reading.Update Jan. 4 2013 -OK, so I got the new TV and I have to confess that I was wrong about the WiFi. It works perfectly with the new TV, so far I haven't encountered any streaming issues, even not the slightest! It is obviouse that it was a singular TV problem and not a design issue.Suspicious as I am, I waited at least a week and tried to stream multiple hi def multimedia and as mentioned, no problems at all.Despite the good experience I decided to leave the 4 stars and not to grant it with 5 stars because I think there are some areas that Sony could do better:1. The remote control - unless you're a teenager that writes text messages all day long you'll find that it's a nightmare to browse with it. It's also not very ergonomic you'll find that the volume button location is far from ideal. In addition I find that the circle in circle design of the navigation/command keys is not optimal, especially if you're blessed with big palm and fingers. Now, combine everything together and imagine what it's like to try to browse somwhere the WWW and accidently press the wrong button because they're so damn close. Frustrating!!2. The user interface, especially for the smart features are not intuitive and it looks like you can reach several feature in various ways. I didn't like it at all. I also didn't like that you cannot upload apps except for the variaty in the Sony Entertainment Network (SEN).  Oh, and it's firmware doesn't support flash! Annoying. To summarize, Sony needs to improve the smart software side. But to balance- how much time will you spend playing around with the smart features...? An hour a day in the first week and 30 seconds for the rest of the system life...3. Last, part of the reasons I bought Sony is the quality and I'm a little bit disappointed that the first set was defective. I know that life is not perfect, but.... It's not a fun experience. At this point I'll mention again the excellent service I got from Amazon. The exchange was fast and hassle free, no questions, no bugging, nothing! Straight to the business- you have a problem, we'll fix it. Period.Bottom line is that despite the minor issues above, it's definitely a great TV with great picture, great features, good sound and all in all I enjoy my procurement and will recommend it to everyone.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture.

It is really night and day, the difference between the picture.  We do have a 52\" SONY LCD in the basement and the picture is awesome as well, but this LED even blows that away.

The sound itself on the TV is okay, but ok at best.  The DELL system was $40 and sounds incredible with this TV.  The 4 HDMI were also a major selling point.  How some companies only offer 1 or 2 HDMI ports to me is staggering.  Anyway, I love this TV and again, another quality product from SONY.

People didn't look Real. They looked like they were made of plastic. 2)Two audio outputs seemed to be missing. 3) The 5.1 audio optical output didn't work. I called customer service and we spent a lot of time adjusting the picture. Things got worse. I had assumed that the picture had been factory set. One option under Picture is to reset to factory settings. I tried that and that got me into the ballpark with just a little touch up, the picture was greatly improved. For problem 2, where the audio jacks were to be, there where 5/16th round pieces of grey metal or plastic tubes that stood about a 1/4 inch from the connection board on the back of the TV. I didn't want to stick a plug into the hole to see what would happen. I was told by customer service that they had never heard of such a thing and they would send a repairman out to change the board. OK I would wait for the repairman and also to see if he had another optical cable that would work.A few days later the \"repairman\" came and the first thing he said is that all he does is change boards. The board he brought looked just like the one I had. He told me that the manual had been written for several models, and my model didn't have those two audio outlets (which was not correct). The problem with the optical cable was my own ignorance. It was new and came wrapped with a foam cover for protection of the lens. Even though I have a 1st class radio television license and had worked and retired (15 years ago) from the labs at Bonneville Power Administration in Washington State, I had never used an optical cable before. What I thought was the lens was another small cover that needs to be removed easily with your fingernail. I felt a little stupid but he told me he had done the same thing a few years ago the first time he used one. We got all resolved? No. After he left,in cleaning up I found a cable, that I didn't know I had, that had a mini audio plug on one end and three RCA plugs on the other end. I thought \"do you suppose?\". I tried to very carefully pug the mini plug into the audio outlet tubes, yes, it plugged in. I imagine, the plastic tube is an improvement to keep the tip of the plug from shorting to ground.

The picture is good, as one would expect from Sony. The audio, however, is terrible.

There are no RCA audio output jacks - only a headphone jack and an optical output jack. My perfectly good stereo has no optical inputs. So, I was forced to use the headphone jack and an adapter to convert to RCA jacks. When you do that, you lose the equalizer, surround effects, balance, and ALL audio adjustments except volume. My stereo is better than any soundbar I've heard to date, and the lack of RCA jacks and the lack of any audio adjustments other than volume when using external audio is a real minus for this set.

On my first HDTV which was a Sony CRT flat screen, 37\" that weighed at least 150 lbs. Small screen, big tv that had a perfect picture. Then I bought a 37\" Samsung LCD and it was very nice. Some two years later I upgraded to a Samsung 40\" Smart TV which has a beautiful picture and great features.After two years I decide to upgrade again to a 46\" and thought I'd give Sony a try. I decided on this tv because of the features, size, price and mostly great reviews at this site.Well, I reckon I got a lemon out of the box. Picture looks like my old analogue tv's used to look or worse.Called Sony (had to call a non-800 number after hours and my phone service is on a limited plan. Did not like that.) They were very nice and as helpful as they could be (on the phone approximately 45 min.) but it became apparent that this TV was defective. They offered to send a repair tech out to look at it. I declined considering this is a new tv. They offered to exchange for a new one at no shipping cost. I declined knowing if I accepted they would then own me. And I don't know that I want to stay with Sony at this point in time. Will probably go back to Samsung.I then contacted Amazon, telling them the bad news, and asked to return which they agreed to do at no cost to me after asking me several trouble shooting questions about the set. Like was I sure I was viewing an HD channel. The support guy was very nice and I'm sure he didn't intend to treat me like an idiot but come now. LOLOther cons to this tv for me:  Remote is not very user friendly. It has a circle of arrow buttons around the select button which are for moving up and down or forward and backward and then another circle of buttons just outside that one for menu, options, return etc.... Too often when trying to use one set of buttons I'd find myself hitting the other set of buttons and this became very frustrating. Better keep your eyes on the remote when using it.Yahoo widgets does not include Pandora like my Samsung does. I thoroughly searched there widgets store several times for Pandora to no avail. Go figure.Nor did I see Pandora in with the other apps. that were readily available. It is available both as a widget and an app on my Samsung. Maybe it can be found or purchased but why should I have to go looking for one of the most popular apps out there. At least it certainly is popular with me. :-)The user interface with Netflix was not as appealing or user friendly as what I have had to date with my Samsung.Also two of the HDMI connections either didn't work at all or provided a connection that was not readily detected by the TV. Nor did this set find my signal source on initial setup. If you don't know how to find the source using your remote you would have to call Sony to find out where your picture is.Back she goes. So much for watching all my Bowl games on my new 46\" HDTV.BTW the three stars or because Sony customer support was there when needed and Amazon is standing behind there service agreement. The tv itself is \"no stars.\" Again, mine may have been that one lemon in a hundred or more. Doesn't mean they all are.Update: Returning this TV at no cost to me was simple and trouble free.

I've read discussions about how lousy sound is on thin LEDs, and now I know it's true. We don't have (and don't want) surround sound, but I've ordered some external speakers that I hope will help with this problem. The picture is pretty good. I've had to fiddle with it a lot to get what I want. The angle visual isn't great. I just feel like we took a step backward with the sound issue. I'm looking forward to the wifi though.

It is going to cost me over $500 to get it fixed because it is over my 2 year warenty...So I bought this sony thinking it would be nice to have internet, access to pandora and link to my iphone etc.Well it shipped within 4 days so that was awesome, but I have been working on this ALL weekend like seriously Friday I came  home from work messed with it, then ALL day Sat, and now it is SUNDAY!!The problem with this TV is The Remote app for you Iphone will NOT work because Sony has not added this TV to it, but they say it will be added in the future, so that sucks for now. I found an imedia share app that works but for some reason the connection takes so long it's almost not worth the time. Again I need to have nothing planned all day just to get things loaded. Next if you want to link this tv to your iphone I am still trying to figure that out. If you want to use pandora or any other features you have to have an account with EVERY SINGLE one!!!!! So you have to have yahoo account, pandora (which I have) you have to have a sony, a sony essintials, and several other sony accounts that I can't remember, I used the same email and password for every single one. Anyway I figure after I create and get ALL the stupid accounts set up then maybe this will work like I want it, I hope. Oh also your router if wireless needs to be set up not to have all the privacy blocks on it. So I am trying to do that as will by letting it share media folders but there is something else that a sony tech guy and the internet people can't figure out that needs to be done so that my iphone and the tv can communicate and pair. But I haven't figured that out as well and the sony people don't know how to help me. But seriously the remote is soooooo hard to use because you have to becareful not to hit the home button when you are scrolling through each letter to to register something because it exits you out. For the 20th centry they made this WAY to complicated. I don't concider myself completly dum to electronics I can figure things out but they have made this way too hard and I know someone older or that hasn't had a lot of computer experiance would have a really hard time. If I knew the trouble and how long it would take to set things up I would not have bought this. I am still considering returning it if it doesn't start connecting faster or preforming better. I have high speed interent and my computer and Iphone loads up in seconds pretty much instantly and the TV is connect to the same internet and it is taking FOREVER!!! It is just almost a waste of my time. I could push pandora on my cell phone and it will start playing right away not the tv....so we will see....maybe i have just got to get every single thing link I don't know. But sony sucked it up on this one. Not a good product for the average person that just wants to come home after work relax and watch or listen to music on their tv without a hundred hassels to get it to work and a hundred steps and buttons to push to get you there. The only good thing is it does have a netflix button, Thank you God because my kids would not know how to get to netflixs without some intense training if it didn't have a button. My 8 year old can work her iphone better than I can almost and she can get on my computer and google, youtube, club penguin, and any other sites she fells she wants to go to without any help what so ever but it's hard for her and my 15 year old to get to anything other than cable on this tv....it's just really stupid the way they have it all set up.

Cohn", "ReviewID": "R1VKCVZ9UBZSKU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I don't think I received a bad unit per se. I think the overall design and performance of this TV is generally fair, certainly not in keeping with Sony's former glory. The TV works and image is comparable to others. There is nothing special about this TV that I notice. I'll list the negatives from my experience. It was one of the only TVs with universal power -- I wanted to buy a unit with 110-240V power input since we may move abroad at some point and few if any TVs offer this.Shipping Experience: 1 starGranted, this is minor part of the overall experience of the unit itself, but it's still part of the \"out of box experience\". Amazon promised via its own website that it would be delivered next day. Of course I knew that was too good to be true and it was. Then I got an email from Amazon saying the shipper (ADS) would email me to set up a delivery date. I did and I set a delivery time for 5 days from order date. Not what I expected but reasonable. Then late on that day the shipper calls me directly to set up delivery time. I told them I already did via their website and that it was supposed to be TODAY. They said that their site is bogus and the TV was not available to be delivered. I had to take delivery after Thanksgiving since I was out of town. All told I had to wait 12 days to receive the unit from when I ordered it. I was also given a 4 hr window which is fine and they did arrive in that window. I was told I'd be called 30 minutes prior and was not. I was in the shower and almost missed the driver. There was only one guy who brought in the unit. They said two would be on hand. That didn't matter, but I had to remind him that he was supposed to set it up and test it first before accepting delivery. He did quite willingly. The unit booted, so I kept the unit.Networking: 3 starsMy main interest in a SmartTV is to use DLNA and internet services like Netflix. A DVD/Blu-ray player is fine but I'm weening myself off of physical media. Network set up was a breeze. But later after I unplugged the unit, then plugged it in to call tech support, it lost my network settings. When I tried to reconfigure wireless, it would not let me!  The screen said there was no USB wireless device attached. Huh? My unit has WiFi built in, so sounds like it thought it was expecting a WiFi dongle. So I repowered the unit and decided to go into standby mode for some reason by itself. I could not get the unit to power on for 2 minutes. When I went back to reconfigure WiFi, it no longer displayed the USB message and did seem to retain my previous hotspot password. That's super bad - a security breech. It should either reset everything or nothing. Anyway, it reconnected.Picture: 4 starsThe picture shine only with Blu-ray or DVD connected. I don't have TV so could not judge that quality. It's true, the screen cannot get bright enough in daylight. It only looks bright enough at night or in a TV showroom at BestBuy.NetFlix: 1 starI have three other Netflix devices and they all work better than this TV's built in Netflix software. I have a blazingly fast internet connection and yet this TV stopped over 15 times during a 30 minute show to catch up on its stream. How aggrevating to have the video stop constantly waiting for it to catch up. Could it be my connection? I connected the other three Netflix devices to my TV (Sony SMPN200 media device, Roku XD, and LG Blu-ray player BD390). All performed flawlessly--no interruptions. Same network, same location, same source. There's something wrong with this TV.DLNA: 1 starThis Bravia DNLA client is terrible. My two other DLNA clients (BD390 and Sony SMPN200) both have superior UI and UX. Bravi's DLNA presents media very slowly and with large meaningly gray icons in a grid format with tiny titles below that are unreadable and cut off if too long. It should present them in a list format to read the titles, esp. if the icons are big and useless. Sometimes the unit hangs when trying to play video. If it does hang, there is no way to power it off from the side controls or remote. You have to pull the plug.For me, these problems were enough to request a return. You may not care about these issues. Fortunately, Amazon customer service was very responsive and set up a return. I tried tech support as a last ditch effort, but decided it was eventually just a waste of time. They were not able to help improve this set. My overall out of box experience is awful.While I was waiting for ADS to call me to set up a return (they never did) I took the unit out to continue trying it to see if I should cancel the return. So far, the TV is generally fine except for those major problems. It's Smart TV functions generally don't work so you have to supplement with external devices.I may want to mount this on the wall, but the manual seems to imply that it may require a special mounting bracket--not a standard one which I have--which would cost more money and hassle.Positives:- The unit powers on- The picture is tolerable- Sound is muffled and poor, but you can hear it- Unit looks nice- Remote is average, unusable for Web surfingBottom line: There must be better TV out there.
