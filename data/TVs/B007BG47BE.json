It's one or the other, not both.I've owned and viewed some really good HDTV sets over the years and this set is among the best. There are three display settings, Standard (which sucks), Movie and Dynamic. I'm running the set using the Dynamic setting, although I also enjoyed the Movie settings too. Dynamic gives better brightness and a bump up in color saturation, but the Movie setting gave very warm color representation if not so bright. I've increased the brightness to about 60 to compensate for the default dull look of the screen on default settings and I increased the sharpness by 10. *These changes in combination with the Dynamic display setting gave much better results. But it's when I changed some of the HDMI output settings on the PS3 in combination with these changes when the quality of the display reached among the best in class that I've ever viewed.Video games also look great on the set as I've tested quite a few. Dragons Dogma, Super Stardust, Killzone3, Dark Souls...all looked and ran great. You should have no problems there.I didn't mention the speakers on this set mainly because I never use the default speakers on any HDTV I purchase. I've always run sound through HDMI using my 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound setup depending on which room the HDTV is going into. High fidelity displays with mediocre sound is not a great way to enjoy HD content. Better to just invest in a decent surround sound setup.Overall, this is a great HDTV set that I highly recommend especially for the price and size. I've seen some really good LED HDTVs at similar sizes and great quality but if you're funds aren't that extensive and you want a large HDTV with a fantastic screen for a great price...Look no further.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good buy", "Author": "Peter S \"Peter S\"", "ReviewID": "R1AF8MRSWVTTLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Set-up is easy. The picture quality is excellent. For built in speakers the sound is reasonably good. Overall I am extremely pleased with this TV. I do however have one minor issue. It is advertised as having \"2 USB inputs, 1 component input, 1 composite input\". I needed the component input for a DVD player and the composite input for an old VCR. The composite input uses a subset of the component input jacks.

After four trips to Best Buy (and changing my mind about 5 times), I went with this one.  Less than $1,000 and 4 out of 5 sales people at BB recommended Plasma over LED for true, rich colors and less motion blur.  It seemed way too big when we first got it home, but soon adjusted to the size.  Absolutely gorgeous color and sharp picture once we got an HD box and I played with TV settings.  It is so easy on the eyes, which my husband and I both LOVE.  You can clearly see so much on the screen and some scenes literally take your breath away, they are so stunning.  I did purchase a 4 year warranty, so I am ready to kick back and enjoy this TV.  There is glare from lighting, so I prefer to pull the drapes when viewing in day time; other than that, no complaints at all.  I purchased a 'smart blu-ray player' and decided we didn't need a sound bar, as the sound is clear and more than acceptable.

Warm 2 (the warmest choice) is actually neutral on better sets.When black levels are set to get deep blacks, shadow detail is nearly completely lost.Highlight detail is not as good as other plasmas and very blown out compared to good LCD/LED sets.Significant trailing and some ghosting despite the claimed 600hz refresh rate.Color booming at times, especially reds.  And this is a strange one and my biggest gripe...  Whenever there is a picture that is predominately bright or white, the entire picture goes to a dim, flat gray.  This is really annoying and I've never seen this before in any set.  Does anyone else notice this?UPDATE:Just wanted to mention that I bought this TV from amazon when it was $850.  It's currently $630 and at this price it's a steal!  I have changed my rating to 4 stars due to this price reduction.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great TV for the minimalist's out there!", "Author": "Aces and 8s", "ReviewID": "RASE21SMS6QSK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me get this out of the way first, this TV does not have all the bells and whistles, so if that is what you're looking for, go elsewhere. No 3D, not internet, and only 2 HDMI ports, 1 component hookup, and one USB port. That being said, none of this bothers me, and here's why: I only have my cable box (HD components), XBOX (HDMI), and DVD player (HDMI) hooked up to it. I have nothing else, nor will I probably need anything else. If I do, I could always purchase a HDMI switch box. I don't have a need or use for 3D, in my humble opinion it is a useless technology in it's current state. I also do not need a \"Smart\" TV. My XBOX does everything I would need or want a smart TV to do. Again, if you were looking for a set that was all your hopes and dreams in one, this is not it. However, if you're a minimalist like myself, this is a great set for the money. Sure, there are others out there in the size and feature range for a bit cheaper, but I prefer Samsungs, *shrugs*. The picture quality on this TV is great, dark colors are very nice (upside of plasma) and everything else vibrant. Personally, for larger size screens plasma is the way to go, for now. LED/LCD will catch up soon, but it's not there... YET. That's another discussion and debate however. Like I have said, for the money this TV is great for what it is. The negatives are nit picky items, I wish the stand was glass rather than sheet metal and plastic, my 50inch Sammy that this one is replacing had a nice stand, but the one it comes with does the job, but it doesn't swivel like the other one did, no biggy. Also, like all the Samsungs I have owned, the speakers leave much to be desired. It seems the thinner TV's get now a days, the worse the speakers get. It makes sense, but at the same time I miss the blaring sound that would come out of the old school CRT set top TV's a quarter of the size of these new ones. Oh well, a good sound bar or theater system solves that. All together, I would rate the TV a solid 4.5 stars for the speakers and stand quality, we will round it to 5 stars because I feel for what is is, the TV is a bargain for the price.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture but unforgivable white noise", "Author": "D. Petersen", "ReviewID": "R38QJZCEI0PHN6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV at best buy for 699 which is a great price for a TV that looks this good. There are two things that made me return it in the end though that you should consider. First, I had it in a room with lots of windows and white walls which you can't do. This TV reflects all ambient light and dark blacks are worthless if you can see your reflection in them. I avoided watching it during the day and all lights had to be out to watch it at night. The second problem with the TV was a horrible buzzing noise that it made constantly. It was a white noise emanating from the screen itself that felt like it was in my head. Two people I told about it could hear it clearly and two couldn't so just keep that in mind if you are sensitive to high frequency noises. I realize that most plasmas buzz but it should not be this audible and could not be covered up by the sound of the movie. It just buzzed over the audio no matter what volume. These are the compromises that you must make buying what is probably the cheapest flatscreen hdtv above 50 inches plasma or otherwise. In the end I returned it and my ln46d630 is on the way. I'll give up a few inches of screen and the plasma contrast/refresh rate to not have to deal with these annoyances.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Very First HDTV with Both Good and Bad News", "Author": "Big C", "ReviewID": "R1JKSVD2RWZXAR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the Samsung Plasma TV on November 18 and received it on the afternoon of November 26. Thanks to my friend who happens to also own a Samsung Plasma HDTV, I was able to purchase this guy for $847.99. Otherwise, I would have missed the deal. I invited him over to help with assembling a credenza (Techcraft TCL6228 - also ordered from Amazon)and placement of the TV. Once all was said and done, everything looked beautiful. The credenza and TV are a perfect match in my opinion. I fired up the TV along with my Playstation 3 and Xbox using HDMI. I enjoyed gorgeous HDTV, Blu-ray, HDDVD, Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video, and pretty much any content I could throw at it. The color saturation, contrast, rich blacks, and sharpness were fantastic even for this nearsighted guy. Shoot, even the static, before I had any content on the screen, looked good on this TV. :-) I use only antenna for TV and was very pleased with the video quality. So, this went on for about 3.5 days until my TV gave out on me. It was a hard week at work and I just wanted to come home to some sweet HDTV, but was greeted with a blank screen. The TV flickers on and off like it's trying to come on, but nothing is displayed on the screen. I attempted to do some basic troubleshooting (changed power strips, power cords, outlets, and even let the TV sit for a while, disconnected from any power source) to no avail. I called Samsung technical support and spoke to a tech for about an hour. We didn't get anywhere of course and she referred me to a local TV tech. He's going to place an order for a power supply. Once it arrives, he'll schedule an appointment to come out and perform the repairs. To my dismay, the shiny, new HDTV sits atop my credenza collecting dust during the peak of college football season. I hope that everyone who owns this set takes heed. Don't get me wrong, I love my new Samsung Plasma, but didn't expect it to fail in only a few days. All I can do now is just wait and dream of being able to watch HDTV again. Tune in for an update once my power supply is replaced. Thanks for taking the time to read my review. Would have given a rating of 5 stars, but needed to take one away because of a malfunction. :-(Update 12/12/12 -Work order to have the TV repaired was placed on November 30. Two Samsung Techs in a white van showed up on December 5. Didn't have to take any leave from work since they were flexible enough to come out around 5 PM. They promptly laid the TV on its face over a blanket to prevent any damage to the screen. The back panel was removed and after running some diagnostics, it was determined that the main board had malfunctioned due to some unknown reason (could have been a factory defect). They replaced the main board (this is where all the inputs are located - HDMI, USB, etc) and closed everything back up, plugged the TV to the power source, and voila! The TV came back to life. Just hope nobody else experiences this SNAFU.

Looks great with the Xbox 360, with Game Mode on. Extremely convenient that it saves the settings for each picture mode, so you can set it and forget it. The speakers actually sound really good, but it's in a bedroom that is about 15'x15', so I can't comment about how they sound in a larger family room. But what I do know is that most hdtv's don't have great sound to begin with, considering they're so slim these days. But who doesn't know/expect that? We all use surround sound or sound bars.This tv also has a digital optical sound output, so it's simple to hook it up to surround sound, if you want to use the 2 hdmi inputs for other devices. The setup was very easy. When you know what you're getting, this tv is perfect. It's clearly listed as having 2 hdmi inputs and no pc input. As with most plasmas you get a very noticeable reflection in a room with lighting, so a darker environment is best for this screen. The Media Player Connectshare is an awesome feature! I can hook my 1TB External HDD to it and play blu-rays right from there- Plug and Play.Couldn't be happier with this tv so far, now hopefully it lasts. You can extend the warranty by 3 months by registering it with Samsung. Overall, the picture is stunning when playing Call of Duty: Blacks Ops 2. I can't test this for HDTV quality because I don't have the service right now.Blu-Ray movies look great. Great color, no motion blur, seems like a perfect image.Physically: The tv looks great, it's very sleek, and slim. I may decide to mount it, considering it's thin build.Purchase: There was no way I was waiting in any lines on Black Friday. I went to Best Buy and Walmart Thursday night, just to check out the frenzy, and I am happy I decided to get a way better deal for this huge tv, online. The scheduled delivery made it very convenient as well. The delivery man was respectful and prompt.

The size is really nice! I don't want a TV in the living room smaller than these 60 inches anymore. The price was right too, $1,000. I don't care that its NOT 3D or Smart with apps or an internet browser. I just wanted a big TV with a decent screen so I can watch TV and play games. I thought that's what I got.But it didn't take long for me to catch the motion blur. Its not too dramatic but enough for me to feel like this may not have been the best purchase. You can't read the names or numbers on a players jersey if he is running too fast. On video games you can't read the words on the screen if your moving the icon or player around. It takes like a full second to clear up and once it starts moving again it blurs again. For a $1,000 I didn't think I should have motion blur. Also some scenes in movies can be too dark during dark scenes, you have a hard time seeing what's going on.I contacted Samsung and they said I have the latest firmware and they told me to reset the TV.

I'm calling up and returning this TV and I'm upgrading to the E550. Now its going to be 3D and Smart but I just care about the picture being clear, even during fast motion, and at a decent price.This says it all I think, regarding the E550 screen performance. I hope its true.(I don't think Amazon let's me post links here. Go to TelevisionInfo dot com and find the TV model for the E550, performance, screen performance and see what they say)This was my first HDTV purchase. Iv'e had the TV for 2 weeks now.

The screen is supposed to be at it's most sensitive to burn-in right for the first few dozen hours of operation, but I haven't noticed anything at all.  Upon turning it on for the first time, it'll search through all the channels before you can do anything, but that only takes a few minutes.  Once you see the picture, it'll look a bit dull out of the box, but spend 10 minutes tweaking it the picture settings to fit your specific room and lighting and it looks AMAZING.

Using a Roku as my main streaming interface which works great, and with a purchased screensaver that basically emulates what a lot of people use to break in their plasma I think I'm good.

Yes, a third HDMI input would be nice but I already have a HDMI switcher for additional needs. Audio is just fine for the room the set is located. Do wish I could label my inputs more clearly such as Xbox vs game and Roku vs AV but not a big deal.The packing was the first clue that this was going to be a different experience. Substantially better packaging in a sturdy box. At least twice as think as the Panny box and much more secure.

When i googled the problem, i was very unhappy to find that samsung had a recall (after a class action suit) for their 2008 and earlier models for the same issue but are denying responsibility for tvs bought after 2008.  A quick internet search turned up a lot of very upset and unhappy customers with the same problem in the post 2008 plasma tvs.  I spoke to Samsung and they will not cover the repairs..told me i should have bought the extended warranty.  This is apparently a capacitor issue and occurrs during the manufacturing process.  I am, perhaps naively, stunned that Samsung thinks a tv in this price range should only work for two years and that they deny there is any systemic problem despite the same symptoms appearing in these later models.  Shame on Sansung.  We all make mistakes but true integrity is acknowledging and fixing them...that is how you retain lifelong customers.  I am as sad as i am angry.  I had a better opinion of Samsung than they deserved.  And needless to say, there will be no more Samsung products purchased in our household.  The loss of one customer won't matter to them but it will matter to me that i do not allow myself to be treated so shabbily.UPDATE on 9/19/13:  After further negotiations with Samsung, and my placing this negative review as well as an email to the marketing dept (do not know if those made a difference) Samsung has agreed to pay for all repairs.  They apparently will make exceptions on a case by case basis and I was nine month out from my warranty which is why I was told the exception was made.

The wireless setup was super simple -- automatically found my wifi network, I put in the passkey, and boom. Done. Downloaded Netflix and HBOGO (awesome exclusive Samsung built-in app that pretty much sealed the deal for me vs. competitors like Panasonic) and have been enjoying it since. Remember: this TV is Wifi ENABLED, not \"Wifi capable\" or \"Wifi ready\" -- no need for any extra adapters. Everything is built-in.I do not have a super light room, nor do I do a lot of daytime TV viewing, so the supposed reflectiveness of the TV screen is not an issue for me. Plus, the base looks awesome (glass and metal, no plastic) and easily turns the TV away from windows if needs be.Picture quality is great. I have not tried 3D and probably won't; in fact I wish it didn't even have that. Me no likey 3D.TV itself looks very sharp. Shiny, black, high-tech. The stem of the base is even made of clear glass, to promote the \"floating TV\" effect. Nice touch.I agree with another review: you have to get a little used to the remote working best when pointed at a specific area of the TV (not a wide angle). Not a big deal, but there it is.I find the app selection to be fantastic (it now DOES include Amazon Instant, as well as Redbox), and come April I will be watching my beloved Red Sox on MLB TV Premium! Again, the ability to run HBOGO was a deal-maker for me; otherwise I'd have to buy a Roku box for another $75, so that expense and hassle is saved.The built-in web browser is slow and basically unusable without the (optional) keyboard. I don't see myself using it, which is too bad. My next TV years from now will probably be an Apple product, so I'll just use my iPad til then ;)I went with Plasma over LED/LCD and I am glad. Brightness is not an issue, and mainly I am a movie watcher (I don't use it for gaming at all) so the choice was pretty clear after doing research. Power consumption should not be too much of an issue, according to the sticker which says under $30/year to run. One other note is that I do not have cable; I will use this exclusively for apps (some paid, some free) and DVDs. I have cut the cord and I love it!Side note: this TV is the EXACT width (around 47\" -- remember the 51\" TV screen size is diagonal, so the width is a bit less) of the 2-section \"Besta\" TV stand from Ikea. Looks so good up there! I really debated going with a wall mount, but I'm glad I didn't have to hassle with putting holes in the apartment walls; plus, my wall studs are not located where I wanted the TV.Overall I am a very happy consumer. When I was little, Samsung was kind of the \"off-brand,\" the way Toyota and Honda were when they first came on the US market. Now Samsung is top-rated for TVs and I couldn't be (much) happier with this plasma -- especially after Amazon dropped the price by $100 the second day I looked at it!

The picture on this thing is remarkable, just make sure when you get it to change the picture setting from standard (energy star) to Dynamic.  The difference is night and day.The only cons I have for this is the stand and the connectivity.Stand: It's cheap.  The screws it came with were very soft and stripped easily.  I actually went to the hardware store with one of the screws (they are phillips head) and picked out 8 flat heads that were much stronger.  I used those instead and the stand is as sturdy as anything now.  The issue seemed to stem from the crappy screws it came with.  When I had the factory screws in, the stand was wobbly and you could tell the TV was leaning ever-so-slightly to one side.  Needless to say, it worried me so I went and got better screws, and boom, problem solved.Connectivity: Only has 2 HDMI (I solved that by buying this http://www.amazon.com/Kinivo-501BN-Premium-wireless-adapter/dp/B0049SCB2Y - I highly recommend it even if you have enough ports.  Check out the video review on the bottom, the guy nails it.) Also, only has one component input, not 1 component AND 1 composite.  They are combined into 1, which sucks.Other than those two cons, the TV is great.  Highly recommend it if you are trying to burst into the plasma TV world without breaking your bank.

No 3-D, Netflix, etc.  What it does have is excellent picture quality and a great price.  The one doo-dad it comes with is a feature that allows you to plug in a USB drive and play media from it.  Sounds promising...sounds like it may not work too easily.  I am pleased to say that it does work very well (and is simple).  If you can plug a flash drive into a computer and play a video from it, you can work this feature.  No setup required. Plug it in, change the input, and locate the file.  The finding the file part is not particularly pretty, but does work well.The only difficulty I have with this TV is the inputs are all on the back.  Mine is wall mounted so it is difficult to access these.  This is not a big deal since it's not necessary to access them too often after setup.  There is 2 HDMI, 1 component, 1 coaxial, and 1 USB (for that awesome feature from above).  Along with optical audio out. Also, there is Ex-Link (I don't know what that is).As far as I can tell this TV works just as good as more expensive one's without all the extra stuff (which most Blu-ray players have anyway).

I just watch TV and didn't need any bells and whistles so for $599 I thought this was an excellent choice. Great size, amazing picture, small bevel around around the screen, and low price. Although the picture on this model is fantastic once you spend a few days playing with the settings, I was shocked by how much room reflection the screen showed. I have a Northern facing room with 2 small windows and the TV does not face them. However, even with that small amount lighting you could see every piece of furniture and every picture on the wall. Even at night with only one lamp on you could still see everything reflected on the screen. I hoped I would get used to it, but I found I was getting headaches trying to ignore the outline of everything in the room. Unless you plan to sit in a compltely dark room all day, this is completely offputting. There is absolutely no reason to have such a reflective surface on a TV - it is more reflective than even glass. One reviewer said this is a perfect TV for a couch potato and I agree, for a couch potato that wants to watch himself on the couch watching TV. The older versions of this TV were matte and this was not an issue at all.Also, this model does NOT come with a swivel stand despite the Amazon description saying that it does have a swivel stand.

So I saw this TV for about $510 from BlinQ, and obviously I couldn't pass on that price for a TV this size and quality, but in my excitement, I didn't read all the negative reviews before ordering it. Then I read one that said there was a ringing. I didn't think anything of it at the time. Then the TV came and I was so excited. I unboxed it and set it up and plugged in my PlayStation 3 and turned it on and... What's that noise?It was a ringing, just like the guy had described. It was awful. A really high-pitched tone that was driving me absolutely crazy. It wasn't as noticeable when I was playing a game or something, but it was definitely still there.My first test upon loading my PS3 was playing Tron: Legacy, which looked absolutely gorgeous on the plasma screen. Seriously, that movie is just perfect for that kind of screen. It's glossy and black and crisp and clear and futuristic. It's enough to make a man believe again. But that ringing, man. That RINGING. It was like my own telltale heart, just pounding away during every scene of the movie, every game, every song I played.Not only that, but that glossy screen looked TERRIBLE in the light. It doesn't matter how deep or true those black levels are if you have to put that TV in a room with a window and sunlight because you won't be able to see any of it thanks to the glare.And not only that, but it made games look headache-inducingly bad. I tried loading Guacamelee!, a colorful Mexican-themed platformer, and every time I opened the map screen, full of thin lines, and moved it around, the lines dragged or something and had that weird red-blue effect on the edges and it actually hurt to look at. Then I loaded up BioShock Infinite and just tried looking around but the same kind of effect happened. It looked unbelievably awful, even in \"game\" mode. When nothing was moving it looked really good, but c'mon.The worst part though, is that none of my friends could hear the ringing. I'd turn the TV on and immediately hear it and they couldn't hear it at all. Eventually, we did a frequency test online and found out that they just can't hear as high of frequencies as I can, so I guess this problem will only affect people like me with really good hearing, but then again, why would you want a TV where there's a chance you'll bring somebody over and they'll hear an awful ringing? They could totally see how awful the picture quality got with motion though.After maybe a week, I just couldn't take it anymore. I called the company and got a full refund. They were nice about it, but it was a pretty big waste of time regardless. I ended up getting the Panasonic VIERA TC-L55E50 and I love it. No, the blacks aren't quite as black, but it doesn't make an awful ringing noise, the glare isn't quite as terrible, and the picture doesn't give me a headache when things, you know, MOVE.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's perfect", "Author": "C.

There is not a \"One tv fits all\" so know what you want and find one suitable for you. For example, those who love having many HDMI ports this may not like this tv. It only has 2 HDMI spots. For me this was not a big deal. I have my 2 HDMI spots reserved for my PS3 and Xbox 360, and run my sound bar though the digital optical port. The speakers are not bad compared to the speakers on my Vizio but I would still recommend using a sound bar or external audio system.Great television for the price in comparison to other similar models.

My wife turned on the TV and watched the morning news and then turned off the TV to go run some errands... everything was working normally. When she returned a few hours later and turned on the TV, the entire left half of the screen was solid white with a bit of black flickering boxes... completely obstructing the left half of the picture.

There was no way to immediately exchange my defective plasma screen because Amazon had no stock. The rep could not tell me if any more were on order or when any would be in stock.

Why? Because Samsung are refusing to make the FULL-HD 1080P model (PN51E530) available in my region. Instead the Samsung reps are steering customers to more pricey LED TV's with 3D or SMART TV! For reasons stated below, this isn't a good thing. Its similar to how PC manufacturers are pushing customers into buying overpriced Windows 8 Ultrabooks, when cheaper Windows 7 / XP Netbooks will suffice.My advice is hold out for the 1080P model. I wanted Full-HD for Xbox gaming, so its disappointing! If like me, you can't get the 1080P then overall the 720P is a solid entry-level large-screen TV as many pro-reviewers are saying. BTW: I also looked at the LG 50PA4500 and the Panasonic P50X5 for purely economic reasons, but both earned sub-par reviews versus the Samsung, especially the Panasonic. I even looked at the 46 inch Sony range i.e. Sony Bravia BX453 / BX427 / BX427  purely for the 1080P, but decided against due to the comparably high prices in my area and the lacklustre pro-reviews. Also at home, we have a 720P Samsung from 2006 and its still going well with no screen burn-in even for such an old model!---------------------------------------------------------------GOTCHAS:Overall the Samsung is a capable entry-level large-screen TV. Its one of the better Plasmas too for the price according to online pro-reviewers. But its not 1080P though and I couldn't find a 1080P TV that wasn't LED. LED commands a costly premium for a 3D or Smart badge, both of which are 'questionable features'!Its a horrible time to be buying a TV as over-hyped 3D and overrated SMART LED TV's dominate the retail landscape where I live. It means few economic special offers. The PN51E450 is about the best bet if budget is of primary concern, and like me you've given up on buying a future-proofed TV and are instead accepting an 'OK' TV for now, in the hope that in the future 100 inch flexible screen mega-monster TV's will be here!Its also a horrible time to buy, as 3D and SMART TV gimmicks are unnecessarily increasing prices without corresponding large leaps in picture quality. For instance a laptop connected to the TV via HDMI operated using a wireless USB keyboard will far surpass any SMART TV's onboard software. This is especially so if the laptop has a modern web browser, and a free media player like VLC, that can play every format and rotate photos and videos from landscape to portrait. Moreover, support for 3D is patchy with manufacturers and content providers strategically retrenching from it. BTW: I have a 17\" gaming laptop that uses active shutter 3D glasses. I hardly ever use the 3D feature anymore, as you have to turn up the lighting within the game or power options and it reduces clarity. Its better to run the game at full 1080P resolution without 3D! However, 3D TV is great for animations and animated films but little else IMHO!---------------------------------------------------------------PROS1. PRICE - PRICE - PRICE!2. The USB player is better than I've encountered in the past. Before, I found TV's needed CODEC updates before being able to play a host of different video files. It has a Time Search feature too to skip to a section of the movie. And unlike my previous experience with Philips the Audio doesn't fall out of Sync with the video when you skip forward or back.3. No Smart TV or 3D. I see this as a Pro as it means I'm not over-paying for something that I don't need and which is functionally lacking! Smart TV...'even its name is a dime store joke' to quote Mickey Rourke in Angel Heart. Please no one buy a smart TV thinking its a panacea and a laptop substitute. It is no substitute for a laptop connected to the TV that has VLC or some other Open Source video player that can play any format and rotate video from landscape to portrait, never mind a web-browser substitute. Even a cheap netbook connected to the TV using a wireless USB keyboard will do better. In addition, leading experts say 3D is no longer being invested in by the industry and so is a waste.---------------------------------------------------------------CONS1. The glossy screen makes for difficult viewing during the day as reported in other reviews. This is not a problem for me as I mostly game or watch TV at night, but other reviews on CNET have commented it is off-putting.2. I've had to downgrade in-game graphics to 720P (1280 x 720) otherwise some games run slow even on cutting-edge gaming laptops. Why is that? Games should run in 1080i just fine! Not sure what the cause is yet...3. TV has some HDMI sound issues between games, requiring reset of the TV or computer. further investigation is needed. Had similar problems with a Philips. HDMI is not as reliable as VGA and a sound system!4. SD cable TV signals look bad. i.e. ESPN and Fox Sports. But this isn't the fault of the TV, rather it's the crappy Cable SD signal looking awful on such a large Plasma. SD Dramas look ok. My net + cable provider is cheap but stuck on old SD tech.5. The PIN feature doesn't lock the set. I like to have the LOCK feature in the event of theft, it makes the TV harder for criminals to fence.6. Only two HDMI ports, but I plan to use a $20 remote control HDMI switcher which is fine for a camera etc. But its not what you want for a laptop and a game console.7. No VGA. VGA is handy for troubleshooting quirks with HDMI which are frequent, or if a friend visits with a legacy laptop and wants to show you their holiday photos etc.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "my experience", "Author": "caedora gardiner", "ReviewID": "R3ETDKTAFHBFRJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got my product from blinq for 510 dollars and it was \"like new\"-i must say i was really disappointed. They have never let me down before but i guess there is a first for everything. First let me just say, my product got to me about six days after the expected date. I was waiting everyday for this product and it arrived so late to me that i was able to take a trip to new york and come back and still hadn't received it. Then when i finally did receive it, the front screen was shattered. And i do not mean like a break or crack, it was completely shattered. I was so upset. I tried to call and got the automated system literally 27 times. Then finally someone picked up and sounded like they could care less about my problem. I asked for this tv to be replaced, only to hear that they did not have anymore. BY the way, this was my graduation present to myself from graduating college- what a present right?Anyways the tv finally got send back and i am now waiting for my refund, in the mean time, i went on another companies website and ordered a \"like new\" smart tv for less then 700 bucks. so its all good.........now!", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$999.99", "Features": "Real Black Pro Panel\nConnect Share Movie\n600Hz Subfield Motion\n1080p Full HD\nTV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 46.8-Inch x 30.8-Inch x 9.9-Inch, TV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 46.8-Inch x 27.8-Inch x 2.2-Inch", "Name": "Samsung PN51E530 51-Inch 1080p 600Hz Plasma HDTV (Black) (2012 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31aibqOinZL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007BG47BE"}}
