{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice TV, no good choices for audio", "Author": "Carol4612", "ReviewID": "R89U84IRHAFU8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I chose the Toshiba because of the tiltable stand and the placement of the dvd slot -- left side, and the general quality of the manufacturer.  What I didn't realize when I went for the LED model instead of the LCD, is that this TV has no headphone jack, only an digital optical out.  You would need the GefenTV Digital Audio Decoder to connect additional speakers.  I don't know why Toshiba took the headphone jack out of this model when no one is ever going to use such a small TV with a sound system receiver.  TV manufacturers could also give up on putting the speakers on the back of the TV, since it makes the sound so muffled.  It sounds like a cell phone or something equally not quite there.Beautiful TV, if you could hear it or realistically connect it to anything.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Cost of Getting Good Audio", "Author": "Daniel A. Espina", "ReviewID": "R22PA7A2XOCWI5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As another reviewer mentioned, this Toshiba LED television does not have a headphone jack. This means that many of our computer speakers or headphones aren't compatible with this model unless you pay for it. Well I paid for it and now have fantastic audio blaring out my TV, but I thought others should know how much it'll cost if they want to do the same thing.What you'd need to buy:1. A Toslink Digital Optical Cable ($5-15)EX.Mediabridge - Toslink Cable - Optical Digital Audio Cable - 6ft\"One of these is needed as the Digital Optical Output has replaced the headphone jack.\"2. Gefen Digital to Audio Decoder ($80-95)GefenTV Digital Audio DecoderThis box converts the digital audio signal into analog. What this means is you plug the Digital Optical Cable in one side of this, and get the Red and White RCA output on the other.3. A RCA Male to 3.5mm Stereo Female Y-Cable ($5-10)EX.Cables To Go - 03182 - 3.5mm Stereo Female to RCA Male Y-CableThis cable has the traditional white and red RCA connection on one end, and a headphone jack input on the other. So you'll plug the Red and White end of the cables into the decoder, and finally have your headphone/speaker input to plug in whatever you want.So that's $90-120 for a crazy headphone jack! The last thing I want you to know is that using this method, you can't control the speaker/headphone volume through the TV. What this means is that if your speakers/headphones don't have a volume nob on them, then you'll only get one medium level of volume with no way of lowering or raising it.----Now that I've gotten past the frustration of getting my Harman Kardon speakers attached, I've got to say that I'm pleased with my purchase. The TV is sharp looking, seems durable, the built in DVD player works great, and playing Xbox 360 on it using a HDMI cable looks unbelievable. I thought 19 inches might be too small, but it's actually a perfect size for my compact den. The audio is poor which is why not having a headphone jack is such a big issue, but its worth stating that the vast majority of these LED television have poor audio, and that the headphone jack is being phased out of most 2011 televisions as well. I'm just glad there was a solution, because now that everything is set up, it's pretty great.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba TV with built in DVD Player", "Author": "John Heinz", "ReviewID": "R1MWJ18Q7X2LUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Toshiba TV was the perfect birthday present for my wife.

He had an ancient, heavy box TV in there and I couldn't stand to look at it anymore. I wanted one that had a built-in DVD player so I could take the PS2 out of that room and move it elsewhere. This TV fit the bill.We've had it now for about a month and I love it. At home we use it strictly for DVDs since there's no cable in his playroom, and the picture is beautiful. Sound is just fine and it's a breeze to set up and get working out of the box.We also use this TV in the master bedroom of our RV. This was the first time I had it hooked up to cable and watched regular TV on it. Again...great picture quality. The DVD player is simple to use (my 3 year old operates it himself when we're home), and the screen has adjustable tilt.Overall I am extremely happy with this TV. It's perfect for what I needed and I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking to use it in a similar fashion...as a child's or RV TV that can play DVDs.

As mentioned by all - the audio is a joke. I just bought a small, cheap power amp & speakers to make up for it - and apparently you still need adapters & cables to accomplish that. So much for space saving. Also - it might be an optical illusion, but the Sony 19\" TV in my kitchen looks bigger than this unit. Probably due to having working speakers in the front of the chassis. But the Toshiba really looks small - like laptop computer screen small. Picture is almost painfully sharp - but it does not like motion. Serious pixelation & annoying artifacts during action sequences - perhaps a characteristic of an LED monitor? I bought this for my wife's sewing room, she is somewhat less critical than me and wanted something with an integrated DVD player - and coupled with the hassle & expense of returning a perfectly functioning TV means we're keeping the unit.

Front panel controls would be nice. Perhaps placed on the base or very skinny buttons placed on the bottom edge of the bezel. Aesthetics dictated the decision to place them on the side, probably, but I wish some TV manufacturer would decide that Function should be placed ahead of Form.5.

In my opinion, any company that has been around as long and is as large as Toshiba that is worth its salt would at least supply a prepaid mailing lable.

The idea is too keep the tv out of the child's reach while preserving desk top space. This television with it's built in DVD player fits the bill. The picture is good,and it is mounted safely out of the child's reach,and far enough out of the way that the is not viewing it too closely.

Moreover, when I looked on the internet for ways to fix it, I found a number of other Toshiba products that stopped working.I recommend that no one buys another Toshiba product again, they are pieces of junk!!!!!!!!!To stop buying their products, is the only way they are going to stop making this junk we are spending our hard earned money on!", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "sound is horrible", "Author": "Alice L.

But when my monitor broke this morning and I hooked up the 15\" one, I discovered that it could NOT be used as a monitor, so I had to hook up the 22\" one.  I then went on Amazon to purchase a replacement for the 22\" one now being used as a monitor, searched for \"tv-dvd-monitor,\" and the 15\" version came up in the results, even though it cannot be used as a monitor!  I kept searching until I could find a clear statement that the model being described could be used as a monitor, which the page of this 19\" model definitely did.  So I thought I had found my dream TV-DVD-Monitor until I read the reviews, one of which revealed that the 19\" version HAD NO EARPHONE JACK!  Toshiba makes very reliable electronics, but it needs standardize the components of its small TVs--all should be able to be used as monitors, and all should have earphone jacks.
