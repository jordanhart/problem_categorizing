{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A possible fix for all those who's Emerson won't come back on.", "Author": "Angela Streiff", "ReviewID": "R22SDGZTLJYH7Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV online at WalMart.com durring BlackFriday like many other people. I had no idea what I was getting myself in to.This TV was for my home office. So it receives minimal use. Two weeks after buying it and setting it up, it stopped working. Probably only had 8 hours total ever even being turned on.I was trying everything I could think of. Assuming I must have done something, unplugged something, etc. Nothing worked. I then turned to Google, only to find that litteraly thousands of people have posted all over the internet about buying Emerson TV's and that they suddenly stopped working weeks or months later. I could not believe how many sites I found with people desperately trying to figure out why their TV's just stopped working right after buying them.Everything I found basically said it was a lost cause. I was ready to pack the TV up and take it back to the store. But before I did, I wanted to be able to say I had tried everything to get it to work again (I hate returning things, so a TV was going to be a BIG hassel). I would push the power button on the TV itself and I would get this flashing red light in the lower right side of the TV by the button, over the words that said standby.In a crazy effort to see if something would work to get it back on, I just randomly started pushing buttons on the TV. I found that if you press and HOLD the power button while repeatedly pressing the MENU button over and over, suddenly the TV flashed and powered up. No idea why!My TV has done it several time again. Where one day it just doesn't turn on, but if I do that same thing again, it always comes back to life. It would seem that it's actually getting stuck in some kind of \"standby\" mode, and unable to power up. But holding the power button while tapping the menu button seems to override what evers going on inside and can bring it back to life.This I'm sure is not going to be a fix for everyone. But if when you try and press the power button on the TV itself (not using the remote), you get a flashing red light in the lower right side of the TV, you may have the same issue as I do and I would try the fix I mentioned.In addition, the sound is really bad. I am by no means picky when it comes to the sound from my TV. As long as I can hear it, I'm happy. I don't know what they did with the speakers in this TV, but if you can envision an AM radio turned on with a large tin can over it, that's the sound you get no matter how you adjust it. Words are often hard to even decipher. I've bought $8 computer speakers with better sound. So to hear anything, you're almost forced to set up external speakers.As for anyone looking to buy this TV, I would NOT recommend it. Google \"Emerson 32 inch TV problems\" and you will see why. The consumer affairs site has hundreds and hundreds of complaints saying the same thing. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because there are some people out there who do get TV's that work, but this brand has a lot more lemons than ANY other I have ever seen.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent Entry Level HD TV", "Author": "KMA", "ReviewID": "R1GOIDTR4TGM95", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV knowing some of its flaws. It is a perfect TV for those wanting to start and HD set up but don't want to spend a thousand and some on a set up.Pros: 32\" great size for average sized living room or space you are putting this in.The picture is crisp and clear; as long as you are using HD inputs and video sources of course.Has a \"auto-on\" and auto-off\" if any device hooked via HDMI supports it, when turned on like a Bluray player or gaming console the TV will automatically turn on and move the the right input. The auto-ff with the device doesn't seem to work all the time but only on cretin devices.Cons: The refresh rate of this TV is quite low and can result in \"smearing\" or \"bleeding\" if the picture moves too fast. It isn't as noticeable in bright scenes but darker ones you can see it (I know the TV would do this after all it isn't very high end.) The base of the TV is secured with four Philips screws, while this really ins't a major issue, it can be cumbersome to move it since it cannot go back into its original packaging without it off.It does lack a VGA computer input. While this isn't such a problem anymore with modern Desktops and Laptops both having an HDMI out, plus VGA is a low resolution SD input anyway so not too much of a problem unless you don't have a machine with HDMI out.720P while to me this ins't a con, I find that a lot of people that want HD want the highest available, that would be 1080P, however, this in my opinion is an entry level HD TV, and 720P still offers an amazing picture; it also costs less money than Full HD systems.Conclusion:Overall this TV is nice for what it is. Obviously it isn't the best out there but that isn't what the price suggests. while you may find others better for this price I do find that this TV does live up to what it can do. the imige it offers is crisp, clear, and vibrant.

For the price it's well built and displays a wonderful picture. The blacks are true blacks, not greys like you see in some of the other pricier models, and there's hardly any, if no pixelation whatsoever.Not once in the past two years of owning this TV have I encountered any problems such as the TV never turning on or the like (perhaps because it's a refurb).It has three HDMI ports, one on the side, two in the back, plus your standard A/V hookups, coax hookup, USB and S-Video.You have four options of viewing size with the TV (Cinema, Zoom, etc.), power saving mode and more.These have dropped in price considerably on the secondary market making them one of the most affordable HDTVs out there, some even in only double digits.Typically, you get what you pay for, but if you're getting a refurb Emerson LC320EMX you won't be disappointed.

I had done no research before hand.  The hook-up for the TV was very easy, and the picture is beautiful.  When I tried to hook up my DVD player and/or my Wii, the TV didn't recognize that something was connected.  The HDMI cable for my DVR works just fine.  I even tried a splicer for the cables to add to it - that didn't help either.  It didn't recognize the 6 prong cable or the 3 prong cable.  Walmart is being very good about returning it - I don't have the original reciept as it was bought on my friend's credit card, and 6 weeks later I don't have the original box either.  They are allowing me to pay the difference for a comparable Vizio (that I had in the past and LOVED) that has more connections as well.

I've had it on for about 7-9 hours a day since Christmas. I haven't had the random blackouts or power supply issues that other owners have had, but there is one very annoying thing about this TV: the remote signal.First, some context. Prior to this, I owned a little 17\" Vizio. This is another budget brand offered in Walmart, but after four years of constant use, it never had any problems whatsoever, and the picture was great. But on top of that, the remote could change the channels/volume from three rooms away. No kidding. I used to bounce the signal off door knobs and somehow it would pick it up, even though no knobs actually faced the TV.The Emerson remote, however, cannot do this. In fact, you have to basically be standing directly two-feet in front of the TV in order for it to pick up the signal. Even then, you have to point the remote directly at the base of the TV. Any deviation will result in a failure to pick up the signal.This is without a doubt the worst remote I've ever used. Now I just hope I don't have the longevity problems that everyone else does.

I took it home hooked up my LG blue ray player via HDMI connection to t.v. I don't have cable since its too expensive at this time. Set up Netflix and man it is amazing!!! It's such a sharp picture, I can see sweat and shiny glossy skin, dark and lights are so clear. Sound isn't bad, but I made it better by hooking up the audio plugs from back of blue ray player to stereo using red and white colored sound part of a/v connectors you can get at store.usually these a/v wires come with blue ray player (don't use the yellow colored wire), that's the video plug- in that you don't need since your using HDMI.
