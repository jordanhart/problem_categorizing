You cannot watch streaming content from any provider (Netflix, Aazon Prime, etc.).  Purchasing a $70 streaming box and a standard TV is a MUCH more efficient and elegant solution.The \"apps\" installed on the TV for common streaming services (Pandora, Netflix, etc.) feature poor user interfaces, achingly slow response times, and low levels of customization.  The entire package gives the distinct feel of a product still in prototype phase.  It is definitely not ready for prime time.With strong WiFi signal, you are rewarded with constant interruptions of streaming (5-10 minute pause for re-buffering several times in any given 30 minutes of viewing).  Open your laptop in the same room and stream the same content that the TV is streaming and you will see drastically better performance.After months of frustration, we have installed a stand-along streaming box and treat the TV as a monitor.  We are VASTLY more satisfied.Vizio should be ashamed to have put this product out in the market-place.  A perfect example of how to shred hard-won customer loyalty.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "Amario", "ReviewID": "RSTAMNSNYYYS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my vizio for about a week now and so far love it; the features and quality almost compares to the other higher costing brands; Built in wifi, sound, and picture quality are high.

Yahoo News, Vudu, and web videos work just fine though.  (Vizio insists that Comcast is blocking their servers, but my Roku and Sony BDP-BX18 are not blocked.)FYI, code 04 works awesome to control my Vizio M420SR HDTV from my Sony BDP-BX18.

Sony remote also has a direct button to Netflix which plays just fine through the VIZIO.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Won't Stream Netflix", "Author": "D Baldwin \"D1&Only;!\"", "ReviewID": "R3535G88CPC7I5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We bought this Vizio M420SR TV about 3 months ago at a local membership club, only because we have a smaller Vizio in our bedroom and really like Netflix Instant Watch. We put the newer, larger one in our living room.At first, it would not connect to Netflix AT ALL. It would return a message after several minutes that we had no internet connection, but we clearly did - we could watch YouTube, access Yahoo features, etc. During initial troubleshooting, after resetting the TV's settings to factory defaults & reconfiguring the Wifi, we weren't getting a very strong wireless signal and thought that was why it would not connect.When I talked to the second support person I found out they had faulty firmware in some of these units which tried to connect to Netflix's 3D content and would of course fail - since this isn't a 3D TV. They couldn't just download the new firmware to flash memory, they had to send a technician out to replace the wireless card and the main board (there's only two boards in the whole TV, so they had to replace ALL the electronics). We also bumped up our internet bandwidth from \"speeds up to 18Mbps\" to \"speeds up to 27Mbps\" even though we had absolutely no trouble on our other Vizio product in the past. In fact, when we first bought this TV, we upgraded the cable modem & our wireless router just to be certain we wouldn't have any issues...Now we show a strong signal from the router, 5 bars at the TV, so clearly there was a problem with their built-in WiFi card. But now, at least half the time when launching Netflix it shows a warning message that our connection is slow. When we tell it to continue anyway, it takes 5 - 10 minutes to download enough to start the program, and then stops 2 or 3 times for another 5-10 minutes each to re-buffer the stream. Now watching a 30 minute program on Netflix takes an hour. This is very disappointing when the Netflix functionality was the primary reason for the purchase.Today when I called, I was told it must be due to interference, and was told to try moving my access point downstairs. It's possible that it's due to interference, but I can stream the same content via Netflix on my phone while I'm sitting in front of the TV without any issues. We also routinely use two laptops downstairs which have not had interference issues either. I'm really not interested in spending more time and money fooling around in the false hope that the TV isn't the problem, that will only make me more unhappy.I'm going to call back tomorrow now that I know others have had the same issue and see what a Customer Service Manager can suggest.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Many things are wrong with this product.", "Author": "Pirouz", "ReviewID": "R7P1QFGA0TPNA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Amazon has a great shipping/delivery service.  However, when I received my shipment, the TV Box was beatup and wet.  The TV has very poor manual and took me a long time to set it up.  Pictures and sounds are not in sync.  for example when watching news, the news person's lips movement does not mach the sound.  TV response to the remote control is very slow and only from certain angles. Access to the Aps is not easy and straight forward, especialy when you have to go through all to be able to chose what you want.I called Vizio Technical support for my problems.  The technician who took the call to \"help\" me with my problems made some strange comments and recomendations.  He asked me to do a very funny thing to solve the remote control problem.  He asked me to take the remote control batteries out and press each key on the remote two times slowly while the batteries are out!!!!! there are about 100 keys on this remote because it is two sided with a qwerty keyboard, but he didn't care and asked me to do it like I am an idiot and don't understand!!! Thank god I happen to be an Electronic Engineer and could tell how nonsense it is.  Obviously, his magic trouble shooting did not solve the remote problem.  Furthermore, He did not have answer to my other questions/problems but just trying to lecture me that \"this is a Vizio TV and different from other brands\" and that the issues that I have are the character of this TV.The only reason that I am giving this TV more than one star is because it has a built-in WiFi and a fair picture and a fair sound, if they could be sync.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0056YN854"}}
