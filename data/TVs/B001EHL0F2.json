Spent a lot of time over the last month checking out various 40-47\" LCD TVs and finally decided on the Toshiba REGZA 42RV535U because of its quality and price (total $912).  Due to my experience with both Toshiba and Samsung I favored these brands but there's no shortage of attractive LCDs to choose from many companies.  Samsung costs more and offered no competitive model or price to this Toshiba.  I found the Toshiba XD-E500 upconversion DVD player online for $76, which produces an excellent picture on the 42RV535U.  Add the $13 I spent for 3 HDMI 6' cables (online too) and I'm watching HDTV for a grand total Of $1001!  The non-HD TV channels look good too (I'm on Time Warner cable) and in my small living room the sound (cranked up) has proven to be more than adequate.  I have checked up on the Sony HT-CT100 Sound Bar Home Theater and may add it later.  I have no Blu-Ray plans for present - will take some convincing and much price dropping for me to participate.My wife and I physically set up the TV on its stand and placed it in position.  If you know what you're doing, the electronic part of the setup should be brief but I took longer fumbling a bit over the cable box/TV accommodations.  But all went well finally.Let me add perhaps the most important thing.  Once set up, I restarted the Marvin Gaye at Montreux DVD that I had been using to hook up the XD-E500 and let it rip.  What a reward for all the effort of buying this TV - my TV watching will never be the same.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "R3I0WXQCDAH2XG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok , so I bought this T.V. about six months ago and i couldn't be happier with it. The picture was crisp the sound was on point. I had no problems with it, until yesterday when it stopped working. Apparently the power supply died in it, so after doing some researched i learned that mine wasn't the only one this happened to. Thank god it was still under warranty and Toshiba is going to pay for parts and labor to fix it. But I'm kinda disappointed that it happened in a six month period with such an expensive T.V.

Watching \"Its a wonderful life\" on X-mas eve, the TV just shuts off, no reason, it was just dead, nothing could be done.3) called Toshiba customer service, got a TV person to come and pick it up pretty fast, but now a month later, it sits in the shop waiting for \"parts.\"This totally sucks, will never buy Toshiba again.

The yellow standby light just blinked three times over and over. The manual said this was normal and when it was ready to start it would go to a green light. No it wouldn't. Manual and Toshiba site said to hold the power button on the cabinet in for five seconds and it would reset it. This worked...twice. The Toshiba site said unplug it for an hour. This worked...once. Now at 18 months, a short power outage from a summer storm knocked it back to the yellow lights. After four days, it is still blinking yellow. I tried every trick I could find short of putting socks and shoes on it. I found this is a common problem with this model. The store will evaluate the problem for $189. The repair to the board that has gone south is $600 parts and labor. Again, I am not the only victim of this shoddy equipment. Toshiba basically told me they weren't concerned with it since it's out of warranty. So, research the model on the net and see for youself. If you have one of these, be scanning the ads for a new tv soon, it will fail. Toshiba says they won't order a recall since the model has been replaced with this new one you're looking at now. The new one has the same boards. $1300 dollars for 18 months service.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "P.

The auto view is a great setting that will adjust to the room's lighting and automatically select the brightness and other picture settings. Loads of inputs, a total of 4 HDMI. Perfect for connecting my cable box, 360, Blu-Ray and still have an extra to spare. The built in game mode and low response time make it a great TV for gaming. No noticeable lag so FPSs play great. The best thing about this TV is the price. I did a lot of research and a lot of people agree this is a great TV at a great price. Competes with Sony and Samsung's lineup.If I could find any cons for this set: The back panel is too close to the edge of the TV, not really a problem because it makes for easy access, but it may cause a pain for cable management.Blu-Ray is still the way to go, but even playing DVDs upconverted to 1080p looks amazing on this set.

Bottom line is they just don't care....you feel as if you might get a \"little' help from them but the final word is take it to a Toshiba service center for repair.  Same darn blinking yellow light, same efforts to solve without success.  Total cost to me in repair $466.  I knew Toshiba wouldn't repair the thing; I just wanted them to sell me the motherboard at a discounted price so the final repair wouldn't knock me over.

A great bit of research and reading of reviews led me to the Toshiba REGZA line, which boasted a fantastic set of features at prices much lower than the equivalent models. After playing with my TV for about a month now, I couldn't be happier. It plays TV, Movies and my PS3 + Wii fantasticly, no ghosting, extremely sharp, great color and contrast.The most important thing to me and the ultimate reason I went with this model is because of its great upconversion abilities. Non-HD programs often look terrible on HDTV's, and you never get to see what they look like in the stores as they always play High def programs. The REGZA line has a great upconversion processor in it, which makes standard definition look quite smooth and clear, all things considered.Just a small warning however: I had a very strange issue with it regarding the auto brigtness sensor. For whatever reason, TV's with this feature sometimes block your cable box remote IR signal, which can be quite frustrating. When I tried to use my cable box remote, it only worked if it was directly touching the box. After disabling that feature however, my remote worked just fine. So if you seem to be having the same problem, dont blame the tv or the cable company, just turn off this feature in the TV menu.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 42 inch TV", "Author": "Robert R.

I bought a 42 inch 720p from Amazon in April of 2008.  Within 10 months, the TV developed a solid line down the left side - LCD panel was shot.  Even with the TV under warranty, I had difficulties with Toshiba to even get them to send someone to my house to address the issue, terrible customer service! After almost two months and the inability of Toshiba to supply enough replacement parts to their service centers to meet demand (because so many customers LCDs were going bad) they finally did the right thing and got me this model as a replacement.  That was in March of 2009.  Now after only 11 months, the brand new TV will not even turn on.  My warranty expired because it was a replacement and only lasted 1 year from the original purchase date of the first TV.  If you think I'm over reacting, please google on [\"Toshiba LCD\" \"Yellow LED\" flashes 3 times].  The repair bill costs up to $800.  Toshiba does not acknowledge that they have a quality issue with these TVs and refuses to help their victims.  I believe there may be a class action suit in the works.And oh yeah, I bought a toshiba DVD player only 14 months ago, and it is already acting up.  I will never buy another Toshiba product.

Jurgensen", "ReviewID": "R17YE27E009SZY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have had this TV over two weeks after spending weeks researching TV's.  Its my first LCD TV and I'm very impressed.  The screen looks fantastic, and 42\" is plenty big in our living room (12x22).  I have found no dead pixels, and if you want it brighter, turn off the power save features, however I think the power save/autoview work just fine, brightening as needed based on ambient light.  I didn't find that color settings needed adjusting and left that on auto-home mode.  Screen looks great even with glare coming in from the afternoon sun shining through the front door.  The housing definitely picks up dust, an issue for us since we have a wood stove.  I have the SRT supconvert feature set on automode, but I can't see the difference in the levels, from 1 to 5, and there is little explanation in the manual, and I have noticed now some strange artifacts on non-HD channels, vertical lines/warping, especially noticable on peoples faces on news channels.  It may be the cable box (see below).  The sound seems very good for a LCD TV, and Toshiba I think makes special effort in this regard, as they do not hype 5 speaker surround sound like some other manufacturers, but it is not \"Hi Fi\".We had the TV directly hooked up to cable for the first week, but could not get all channels that way (missing some digital channels that are normally between 100-200 on the Comcast box), so no encore/IFC/Sundance, no digital music channels, no Bloomberg, and no HBO.  Other channels in that ranged showed up under other numbers, like 10-1, etc.  Since we have HBO and on demand thru Comcast, we upgraded to the HD box and hooked it up thru HDMI port 1 on the back of the TV.  Unfortunately, the Comcast box remote doesn't work most of the time when the TV is on, but works fine when the TV is turned off or the HDMI cable is disconnected from the TV.  Its not the remote itself, as the old comcast remote and the Toshiba universal remote (which I have programmed for the cable box) have the same issue with the Comcast HD box.  Also, HBO and on demand do not work, showing only a call comcast message.  Comcast is due out today after 6 days after the cable box arrived and 5 days after the appt was set up.  Its just so strange that the remotes only work to the cable box when the TV is off.

Now JVC can take a big jump to the top here and there with some of there price deals.  Anyway I purchased the Toshibia.  For the money, the features and the quality you can not go wrong.  Did you know 2/3 service calls for lcd tv's are for Visio.  Be aware also that 2/3 service calls for lcd tv's in ANY brand are for power related issues.  This happens to any tv of any brand, so a review that says the power went out after x ammount of time is simply not a fair review.  In fact to since I repair Tv's as well I can tell you that Power fluctuations such as \"Browning effect\" will ruin any tv no matter what brand you stick in your home.  Anyway this TV model is one of the best out there.  120hz, great picture and fab HD.  Did you know that Toshibia TV's upconvert regular analog signal?

I have read reviews and people mostly mention the lack of sound quality without a HDMI connection, but I have been playing Gear of War 2 with component cables and the bare bones speakers are plenty loud and crisp.Another great feature is the VGA connection to my iMac turning my TV into a computer monitor. Now I can search the web and watch online videos on a 42\" HD television. My girlfriend can also play World of Warcraft from the couch now, which she loves.This is a great deal and I see the price already went up one hundred dollars since Friday. I'm not surprised. I doubt you can find a 1080p LCD television from a reputable manufacturer with all these features and picture quality for under eight hundred dollars.", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "perfect bedroom tv", "Author": "R.
