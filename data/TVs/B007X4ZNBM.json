{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WOW, UNBELIEVABLE, WOW!", "Author": "Devra", "ReviewID": "ROYPZVEBHWZNK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"Wow,  unbelievable, wow!\" is what found myself repeatedly saying out loud (for 2-3 days), after setting up this TV! (By the way, the set-up was a breeze.) This is the first LED that I've owned (or even watched), but I can't imagine the \"name brands\" being any better! The LED lighting truly does produce brighter light and a fuller spectrum of white light (higher contrast ratios with black being stunningly black), and more natural and vivid on-screen images! (For those who don't like bothering with setting personal preferences, the \"Dynamic\" picture setting will probably yield more than satisfactory results, if you like rich color, tones, contrast).The sound (on it's own) is fairly good too, though my set is hooked up to a speaker system! It does NOT sound like \"talking through stringed tin cans\" (as do some flat screens)!The remote control is fully functional, intuitive, and user friendly. However, ATT-Uverse has no code for Hiteker. This is just a small inconvenience, when compared to everything else!The narrow frame is a great feature, which makes the set elegantly attractive! The smaller size requires (takes up) less space! Another plus is its swivel stand!Even though most flat screens have, at least, 170-degree viewing angles, \"Wide 160-degree vertical and 160-degree horizontal angles provide a clear picture from anywhere in the room\" is the claim for this TV (in some details/features/specs info); however,  my set is situated in  my direct line of vision (at eye level) in my bed bedroom. So fading (color loss) is not an issue, for me. When purposely checking it out for this review (standing about 8\" from TV), I did notice a little loss from top angle , only minimal (if any) from sides, and NONE from bottom!I took a chance on this relatively unknown product based on 3 things: (1) The price, (2) the one Walmart.com review (could find no more - anywhere), and (3) knowing that I would get a cheap but trustworthy 4 year warranty! I am s-o-o-o-o-o glad that I took that chance; and, highly recommend that others do so before the word gets out and the price goes up!06/21/12 UPDATE: 2 reviewers on another site  complained that this TV will not power-on! If this happens, one should know that the set has a \"KILL SWITCH\" on the back, which needs to be in the ON position!", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture for and Inexpensive LED TV", "Author": "A.

Used $10 RCA indoor antenna.  TV tuner and picture very good. Has a swivel base. Nice remote. Don't forget to turn on the power switch under the TV.  I get FOX, NBC, CBS, ABS, PBS and 2 independent local stations.

My old 26\" \"flatscreen\" with the HUGE tube that weighs probably as much as me? was finally biting the dust.  I keep everything forever until it does die.Went window shopping both online and brick and mortar and was getting more and more confused and frustrated.  I don't need a \"smart\" tv - I need something that works, that has a decent number of in/out for my dvd/vcr combo, my PS2 (yeah, PS2) and able to connect to my cable box and it has HDMI and vga!  This has it all.  EASY to set up, as in if I could get everything hooked up and get it working, just about anyone can.  I think the hardest part was getting the base screwed in because you have to turn the TV upside down.  There is a plus to having to do that ...Nice picture, different formats, source for your blu-ray, dvd, game console all are on the remote.  Takes about 5 to 6 seconds for the set to turn on, you see the blue screen with Hiteker, then the regular program/movie, etc.There is a \"kill\" switch at the bottom of the TV - make sure it is turned ON before you plug it - actually turn it on before you put the base on.  That's the plus to having to turn the TV upside down and have someone hold it in place while you attach the base.I love this TV, I would love to have another for my bedroom.  32\" is a perfect size for those of us in smaller apartments/smaller space to place a TV.  Doesn't weigh a ton.  It does get kind of warm in summertime - I have a small flexible standing fan that I run blowing on the back of the set in the summer and that seems to do the trick.  Things getting too warm is a worry to me.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV! Great Picture.

I've had it for just over a year.  The remote control on the other hand is already obsolete.  I purchased two Hitiker TV's on Best Buy.  I've tried contacting Hitiker numerous times because everytime I click on the remote to change the channel or adjust the volume, a box comes up at the bottom left and when you press the channel changer, you get \"Soft\", \"User\", or Dynamic.  I can no longer change the channel or adjust the volume.  The replacements for this model is $39.95.  Crazy, especially since I paid $180 for the TV.
