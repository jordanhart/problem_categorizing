It stopped receiving HD signal from my QAM Cable. I was about to pack this baby back in its box. But boy, what I found was, my BlueTooth enabled cordless telephone base, which was placed just next to my TV, was interfering with Coby's HD tuner. So placed my telephone base away and everything started working fine.Even it spec says 720p, it receives 1080i from cable and 1080p signals from my PC, Logitech Revue and TiVo. PC can be used at 1920x1080 resulution.I wanted to take away one star for its conflict with cordless telephone, and at the same time add an extra star for its un-spec 1080p support.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "COBY 32 \" flat screen", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "R2Y5MNA71NWJFL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This brand (or model) of TV needs to go back into development for issues with the sensors for reciving signals from the remote.  (I'm an engineer and have some work experiance with LCDs and remotes).We had (3) of the 32\" cobys malfunction in a 1 month period.The first would turn off and on by itself (creepy), the second and third cobys that were sent to us as replacments would not accept a signal from the remote if you were operating the remote in a location from the center of the TV to anywhere on the left side.  If you were located on the right side of the TV the remote would operate the TV.Sadly we are going to not ask for a fourth replacement and just request a refund.Amazon was great to work with on both exchanges and the refund.  The best \"exchange/refund\" program I've ever dealt with.Coby customer service was also very nice to work with.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "\"Value\" means fair price for the quality....", "Author": "Dale Ransom", "ReviewID": "R1WZD2DAD691OJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought one of these, a couple days ago for a good price. Yeah, I read the reviews on the \"dreaded\" sound - let me ask you something: for a 32\" LCD TV at an average cost of $250.00, do you expect Carnegie Hall audio?? It has a great picture for the price, easy to set up, and is perfect for that bedroom, kids room, or as a gift for that retired mom or dad.

I have learned my lesson to never purchase Coby again. It turned into a fake decorative piece and the customer service at Coby is horrible. Only had the tv for 3 1/2 months, but they will only send us a part AFTER we pay for the repair man to figure what is wrong then we have to pay installation.

We had problems with it from the beginning, but only minor things at first. The picture would turn black and we attributed it to the xbox in the beginning. I had thought that maybe it was a bad connection. However, the tv has been getting worse and worse as time goes by. Now the picture will flicker and then freeze. It's bad quality and with being a single mom on a tight budget, I'm very upset that I made the wrong purchase.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stopped working already", "Author": "Notorious Fluffy G", "ReviewID": "R24KL4FFYPEPVZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This TV had it's drawbacks, but for the price it was fine. I used it for a monitor for my computer, which it was really bad at since it was hard to read small print, but it was adequate and I knew it wasn't the highest quality HD when I bought it. Since we don't have an antenna or cable service we used it watch Netflix, and it was fine for that. Until of course it stopped working after 17 months. Now it just turns on a dim blue glow and doesn't show anything including the volume channel and menu screens. If it had lasted I would have given it 1 or 2 more stars for being affordable at the time for people like me who don't organize their lives around HD TV, but I guess now I have to save up for a \"real\" TV or computer monitor. I'm starting to have Star Trek rerun withdrawals.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this model!!!", "Author": "Jeff Klein", "ReviewID": "R3NK84SNRZJ5U9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this model Coby TV - and wish that I hadn't. It worked for about about six months(Warranty is 90 days parts and labor), and then started to shut off on its own. Emailed Coby support and was told to ship it back (Georgia) and include $30. I no longer had the box or packing and figured it was going to cost at least $50 to ship it back. Including the $30 fee, it was really not worth doing.

I didn't even realize that TVs came without stereo sound these days, but apparently so. For $30 more you can get a much better TV, so save your money.

Apparently a majority of Coby televisions get this problem within a year, much faster in my case. You hear a pop noise then you suddenly can't turn it back on. If you're lucky enough to get it to last then I can see this being a good deal but, I'd rather spend the extra $50-100 dollars to have a TV that lasts.

Everything's bigger, brighter and better really. I even popped in a old game called Homefront and it actually looks great also. I haven't watched a movie yet, that will be later with my girl but for anyone thinking of buying a hdtv from amazon or the name coby tv, it's a great deal.
