{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Staggeringly good picture", "Author": "Michael Romo \"mikeromo\"", "ReviewID": "R1GCHCTQYJ0W9L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE - September 29, 2012So, it's been a few months since I wrote my initial review of the GT50 and I wanted to give another update.Overall, the set is working great. I have not gotten it professionally calibrated, I want to do that next month, but the picture still looks fantastic, both for 2D and 3D content (\"The Avengers\" looks amazing!). Interestingly, I find myself using the THX-Cinema settings just as often, if not more often, than the custom settings I had generated using the various calibration discs. That may be more out of laziness than anything else, to be honest.A few things:1 - If you have a lamp or a window in your room that you think will reflect on the screen, be aware that the anti-glare coating will not cut it during the day. You'll need heavy drapes for the day and use a dimmer or just turn off the lamp at night.  It can be distracting.2 - My biggest frustration is that I am noticing some degree of line bleed, which I guess is a problem with plasmas in general -- I noticed it with my old Samsung but find myself noticing it a lot more with the GT50. I am very frustrated to have to report this to you all and I am going to see what I can do about it, if anything -- again, this is something that happens on all plasmas, apparently, I just wanted to make sure you all knew that I was finding it somewhat distracting.(Line bleeding is when a \"ghost\" version of another element on a screen actually appears on part of the screen where where it shouldn't  -- for example, a character's face might be in front of a window sill -- the \"ghost\" of the sill continues across the character's face.  There is some discussion of line bleed on the GT50 here:[...] )I am not going to change my star rating for my review based on what I am perceiving as a limitation of the technology (as opposed to the set) but it's something to keep in mind. I will be doing some research to see what, if anything, I can do to address the situation and let you know what happens.Finally, I have received a few email inquiring which kind of TV stand I have (in the pictures section). I got the stand in 2007 from IKEA -- sadly, I do not think they make it anymore. It's a pity, it's kind of a perfect TV stand.ORIGINAL REVIEWAfter six years, it was time to replace my aging 42\" Samsung plasma (during which a circuit board died, which ended up requiring an all new screen to be installed--thank goodness I had the extended warranty).  At first, I went with the UN55D8000, which was a good looking set, granted, but just didn't have the picture quality I wanted, so I ended up returning that less than a week after it arrived.  Then I heard about the new Panasonic models coming out, and realized that the GT50 looked like a promising candidate.I have had the TV for less than a week, and there is no way I am returning this incredible plasma television.  I will share some initial thoughts (and have submitted photos as well), and will update my comments later as a kind of progress report.If you care about picture quality and don't feel like waiting for the VT, look no further.  This set has one of the best pictures out of the box I have ever seen, with deep, silky blacks and vibrant (not never overly so) colors. My \"go-to\" test for black levels is the first scene of Episode 9 of the first season of \"Game of Thrones,\" which takes place entirely in the shadows. Quite frankly, I didn't know blu-ray could look so good. The details in the bricks and the clothing, all illuminated by a flickering torch, were astounding. There was a real sense of depth and clarity, even with this very dark scene--incredible.  I dialed in my own settings using the Spears and Munsil disc, but the settings included in the THX- Cinema mode worked really well and are a great starting point.The color controls for this TV are very extensive, and I think a professional calibrator could really make this set sing. I will get a real calibration done in a month and let you know how it goes. Suffice to say, once I dialed in the proper brightness and contrast and turned pretty much everything else off (and making sure to turn the \"panel brightness\" to low)--the set was great.I watched \"Tron\" in 3D using the Oppo BDP-93, and was very impressed with the 3D and the clarity of the picture. I don't have a lot of 3D content, so I will make sure to add more comments once I see more films. The glasses, which are not cheap, are light and quite comfortable, though it's annoying you are supposed to charge them via the TV--when the TV is on.  It would be nice if they came with little carrying cases or bags, but no such luck.I have DirecTV and the 1080i picture looks fantastic, as does the AppleTV's 1080p. It is with Blu-ray, however, that this set really feels most at home. I cannot overstate how rich the contrast is; my wife continues to comment on how much she notices the better picture, which is a great sign!I have this plugged into my sound system, so I haven't even heard the speakers, really, so I can't comment on the sound quality.As I illustrate in the pictures, the HDMI ports are very close to the side of the cabinet, so if you have thicker HDMI cables, you really need to coax them, gently, down the side so they don't poke out behind the set. I have a set of Bluejeans cables, which work just fine, but my Better Cables HDMI is definitely very close to the edge.  Speaking of cables, while the set does come with a cable stay, there is only 1 (though there are four places to put it)--Panasonic really needs to included another.The bezel is very thin and the set is not that much thicker than the Samsung LCD I had just a few weeks ago. I really like how it looks in the room.  The screen swivels about 10\u00b0 either direction, which is nice. It's also much lighter than I thought it would be; I was able to put the stand on and lift it into place by myself (though, clearly, you should have someone help you--I was just excited).This is a really great set. I haven't seen the ST50, but I can't help but feel that the extra 24,000 shades of grey really push this TV to a higher level of picture quality. I am extremely, extremely pleased so far, and I am looking forward to putting it through its paces--and will let you know how it goes!Update (4/11/12):I started playing with the Internet Apps last night and wanted to add a few notes:1 - Every time I press \"Viera Tools\" or \"Internet\" I am kind of shocked how fast the interface comes up. This is, by far, the fastest interface I have ever used, thanks to the dual processor.  It's so fast that you start to get the feeling that you might actually USE the Internet on this thing!2 - Panasonic does have a web browser (App Store:LifeStyle) but it's a pain to download (you have to enter in your credit card information even though the application is free); I just wish it was included. I am going to fill out my credentials on the vieracast website because it's kind of annoying to enter in the data using the remote.3 - The YouTube interface is actually pretty nice. The text is displayed larger than on the AppleTV  and you can sort by HD Content only, which the AppleTV does NOT let you do--so that's very cool.4 - I still need to check out Netflix, Hulu +, Vudu and other applications. The GT50 offers a very comprehensive assortment of online services and, like I said, it's very easy and intuitive to get to.Other things:1 - Clicking on Viera Tools brings up a toolbar on the lower part of the screen from which you can access various items:- 3D options- THX options - basically, switch from THX Cinema to THX Bright Room and one other THX mode. Pretty good for testing out your custom settings with the THX ones.- Viera Connect - pretty much the same as pressing the \"Internet\" button on the remote- Media Player- DLNA - wasn't applicable to my system- Viera Link - not really sure what the difference is between Viera Connect and Viera Link; I will check it out and update this post- Eco - adjusts the auto-brightness features- eHelp - access to the 208 page manual via a specialized interface2 - There IS an iOS app (and I would assume an Android App) that can take the place of the supplied remote control. Useful, I guess, for Harmony users who may need specialized controls from time to time.  This seemed to work well for the most part but I have some thoughts:- The app makes ridiculous sounds when using the remote. You can turn the sounds off.  Really silly.- The trackpad controls are the default screen, but you cannot control the TV with them. You need to swipe to another pane to get to the arrow keys to navigate the menus. This was confusing at first and then just kind of irritating, because you have to go to one page to call up \"Options\" then swipe to another page to interact with the options.- The reason why I gave up entering my credentials to get the web browser was because the keyboard on the iOS app was NOT sending text to the TV. This is clearly a bug, but once it is fixed, this will work like the AppleTV, where you can use your iOS device to type into the TV, which is obviously much better than using the remote. Lame it's not working for me, though.- There is an iPad specific app which I have looked at but I haven't used with the TV (I don't know if it consolidate the various panes, will update).So, I dunno how important these services and Internet features are to you. I really like my AppleTV, so I already have most of them, but am curious to see Vudu's video quality and check out how Dolby Digital Plus sounds--I hope it works the Toslink output.  I personally will be using my iPad or Phone to deal with Facebook, twitter, etc -- even though image retention and burn-in are much less likely to be a problem on modern plasmas, I don't really feel like tempting fate with having a static web browser interface on the screen while I am surfing the web.hope this update helps!4/15/23 Quick updateTried the 3D. Here's what I got:1 - 2D-3D conversion was nothing to write home about. I didn't know if it was working half the time. Maybe I did something wrong, but it just gave me a headache.2 - Straight up 3D is awesome. Watched beginning of Hugo and found it hard to press \"Stop\". If you are into the 3D, you MAY want to get the 55\" for a more immersive experience, but the 50\" was fantastic, regardless. I still think the glasses make your eyes get tired, but still--the depth is really great, and the sense of immersion with \"floaty-bits\" was really top notch, at least in \"Hugo\".  Look, 3D might look brighter on the LED/LCD set I had before, but there was a sense of depth here that I felt lacking in the Samsung I tried out.3 - I have a few \"THX\" Blu-rays. I watched them in \"THX Cinema\" mode and they looked awesome. Maybe THX is not necessarily just hype?4 - Demo'ed the streaming services. Vudu's HDX format is no joke--it looks incredible, close (from my viewing distance) to Blu-ray, totally. HOWEVER, I could not get Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 (which is supposed to sound GREAT) output from the Toslink output on the TV. I am pretty sure DD+ requires HDMI, so that explains it. Still, DD+ includes the DD 5.1 mix and that sounded great. I was really impressed with the Vudo service and I think I will use it. Amazon and Netflix both looked great as well.  I still like the AppleTV UI, but this ain't half bad.Note: I talked to someone on the Panasonic \"Raise the Bar\" tour and she acknowledged that the iOS remote control app had some issues (the Android one is supposed to work fine) and that my problem (the keyboard not working) was going to be fixed soon. It was kind of cool that she knew about that.Finally, I put up some new photos showing a few off-axis viewing examples, a bird's eye view of the swivel angle, and some shots showing Vudu and Amazon content.thanks-m", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally, a plasma that looks good with the lights on.", "Author": "Sheshechic", "ReviewID": "R18GT8AWFW1TH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv to replace a LCD that had bad off angle views and weak shadow details. The room is bright during the day and I often watch tv with a light on unless we're watching a movie. The THX Bright Room mode is nearly perfect out of the box. I lowered contrast and brightness a bit and turned up color a few ticks. Watching shows like Game of Thrones was breath taking and bright movies like The Fall with all that light and vibrant colors was mesmerizing. And what amazed me even more is the way the image got even better after about 2 days and again after about 2 weeks.For those who are agonizing over whether to buy the ST50 or GT50, here is my advice- if you have a light controlled room, will most likely only use one mode and will you're willing to have it calibrated to attain the best possible picture - then buy the ST50. If you want a dark room mode, a bright room mode and you're not so sure that you want to spend money on professional calibration, then buy the GT50 and never wonder if you made the right choice. The GT50 offers 2 THX modes that are awesome right out of the box and the Custom mode has professional color settings that can be adjusted easily and will offer a reference picture if professionally calibrated.When the GT50 is fed a very good signal such as HD or blu-ray the image is natural, bright, has great color and contrast and the shadow details are the best I have ever seen. I was watching a notably dark movie and could see the detail in the corduroy of a man's black jacket. Wow! Hair has never looked so good on tv. As with any other display, GIGO- bad signals look bad. If you never owned a big screen tv then you should know that it makes all the bad stuff much more obvious and offensive. You should also know that just because a station is HD it doesn't mean that the old stuff is upgraded and will look like blu-ray or even HD for that matter. I think it's a shame that some of HBO and AMC can still be so bad even with newer programming. Shame on them. If you think any of this is the TVs fault then pop in a blu-ray and see what your tv can really do with a good signal and then you'll know who the true offender is. If you are using a set top box from your cable provider or satellite service be sure that you have the newest HD model available and that the settings are right for HD.This tv offers a dual core processor which improves app response and may help with future apps too. I'll take a dual core over single core any day, considering that tablets now have quad core, why would anyone interested in using apps or the internet even consider a single core processor? BTW, wireless was very easy to setup and updating happens without a hitch.There's not a tv out there that is perfect and certainly this tv has a few flaws too. However, my rating is based on what's available, not dreams. The GT50 does have dithering (inherent to plasma tech), DSE (dirty screen effect), does not offer the same tools (isf) for picture adjustment that some manufacturers do and the web browser does not support Flash Player- only HTML 5. IMO, the dithering isn't too bad and is often subtle when it does show up, but can be bad with lower quality signals. If you have a lot of dithering (or sparkles) try lowering your brightness setting. I've only seen DSE once during a subway shooting scene that was dark and is improved when using a less bright mode.I only hear buzzing if my ear is 2\" or less from the white part of the screen. Plasmas shouldn't buzz very much more than this. The tv does not have brightness pops or floating blacks either.This tv is well worth the investment. If you're coming from LCD and really want to love a plasma check this one out in THX Bright Room. ;)Update: I exchanged this tv for the 55VT50 a week ago and I am returning the VT50 to get the 60GT50 back again. IMO, the VT is only very slightly better at handling reflections, blacks are slightly better but not much, shadow detail out of the box was not as good as the GT and the VT will definitely need professional calibration to achieve what might be a significant improvement over the lower models and none of the flaws associated with the ST & GT are any better on the VT- it is not better at motion handling. So my opinion it that the improvements with the VT are not significant enough to justify the price difference, especially not when comparing sets of equal size. I love the picture so much on the GT50 that I don't feel compelled to get it calibrated and that is just not true about the VT50. Also, the 5\" size difference was enough to change the experience I had, while watching John Carter I couldn't help but clearly understand what was missing. The 60GT50 is coming home to stay and I can't wait until it gets here. 8DBTW, thank you Amazon for the price match. '''Update: 1-6-13 This tv still looks amazing and even more so after updating the settings in Custom. We still use the THX bright room settings when it's really bright outside and the shades are all the way up (windows are now directly across from the tv). There is still glare but no worse than on other tvs and not as bad as on some. Blacks still look good even with all that light shining directly on the set. I have seen no image retention while watching tv and I do not hunt for it. We do nothing special to prevent image retention either, we watch anywhere from 1-3 hours of MSNBC daily and hubby has been watching a ton of football.I'll be keeping my eyes peeled for a great price on a smaller GT50 for another room.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Problem Image Rention", "Author": "akgirl", "ReviewID": "RLQXGX4R1670P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV in August 2012 and have been extremely happy with it, the picture is excellent.  A few days ago I noticed that I had an image showing on the screen on all my channels, a retained image from a channel I watch frequently.  I contacted Panasonic through email and they advised me run an \"Anti-Image Retention\" scan in the Setup menu.  I ran the scan for the full 15 minutes and the problem still persists so I let them know.  They advised me to call the Panasonic customer care center due to my television most likely requiring service.  I phoned and was told image retention was not covered under warranty and gave me some tips on how I might be able to get rid of it.  I wanted to pass them on to everyone:-Use dimmer brightness-Don't stay on one channel too long, periodically switch channels-Run the \"Anti Image Retention Scan\" twice a day until image fades-Don't run a channel too long that has a still image on it-Use standard mode instead of vividIt would have been very helpful to have received this information with the TV's set-up quide.

It also offers a comprehensive list of practical features ( no gimmicks like gesture response etc). The on board dual core processor offers smooth performance while browsing, watching online movies etc. No question about this offering the best value for your money in terms of both features and functionality. I also like the look of the TV. I am not a big fan of the edge less design offered by brands such as Samsung or LG.

Worth the price!", "Author": "Brandon Taylor", "ReviewID": "R389W3WZ5M3MUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a Samsung series 8000 TV and loved it. Unfortunately a dead pixel appeared, so I did a little more homework and decided to go with a plasma, which are praised for quality, affordability, and deep and realistic blacks. I am pleased with my purchase.Pros:*Picture looks stunning. I was watching a show on Netflix, and I never noticed how red the main characters hair was until watching from this TV. It was so realistic, even the wrinkles were on his face. My Samsung that was 33% more expensive did not show this!*Blacks are deep and realistic, especially in night scenes. Usually you may see a glowing black during night scenes, but the darkness it pitch black, which makes it so much more pleasing to the eye.*Backlighting is perfectly even. The LED had blotches of uneven backlighting; this one is perfect*Built in WiFi, Netflix, apps, etc. are good quality and easy to navigateCons:*Menus are designed in a primitive way. Compared to the flagship Samsung, these will seem very 2006 style*Thicker than LED, but not by much; I was surprised with how thin it was.*TV is not sexy like some of the others. It is more industrial, and less \"contemporary\" and \"ultra-modern\"*Remote could use a makeover. However, the buttons are large and easy to use.This TV is an astounding value, and I highly recommend purchasing it because of the advantages Plasma TV's have. You will not be disappointed.Update: I did some comparisons of the LED before the shipping company came to pick it up, and my opinion was wrong. I did notice this Viera has exceptional side to side viewing angles. There is just a slight dimming if you stand above in front of the device. Thanks to the person who pointed this out.I also want to praise the SD card reader for allowing me to upload my downloaded .avi files and enjoying them on the TV.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Deep, inky blacks, brilliant colors, Panasonic's GT50 plasmas are nothing short of amazing.", "Author": "Bricktop", "ReviewID": "R1RVQ3133C9573", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up my Panasonic TC-P50GT50 50\" plasma on June 7th. I have previously owned a TC-P42S2 and TC-P50VT20 plasmas from Panasonic. The S2 model suffered from fluctuating brightness but I never did see the black levels rise noticeably like I did on my friend's TC-P42G10. The TC-P50VT20 had far less noticeable fluctuating blacks than the S2, but the black levels did rise and couldn't be considered \"inky\" by any means, although the overall picture, contrast, colours, etc., were simply stunning.The GT50? WOW! What a great set. First of all you won't believe how incredible light this TV is. If it weren't so big you'd easily be able to lift it yourself but because of the width you really need a second person to help you mount it. It's only 1.6\" thick, a huge difference from the VT20 series. The screen filter has also changed and you don't notice reflections as much but the purple hue is also not as pronounced, if at all, as the VT20 and Pioneer Kuro plasma sets show.I haven't paid for a calibration yet, I'm waiting for DeWayne (D-Nice) to post his settings at High Def Junkies to see how much improvement I get over the THX Cinema settings. I have a room with very controlled lighting and double thick black curtains over my window, so even in daytime it is very dark. I do not need the \"THX BRIGHT ROOM\" setting although it still looks pretty great in the dark, but it's too bright. I am currently using THX CINEMA with the Sharpness turned down to 0 as that's almost always the level I see with Panasonic sets that have been calibrated.Inky black levels on a Panasonic, finally. Okay with nothing on the screen you can clearly see that the TV is turned on, but again I'm in a pitch black room. The same thing happens with Kuro sets. But boy this is a really deep black level and with even a little bit of material on the screen the effect on the human vision allows the bezel or any black bars you're watching with a 4:3 or 2.39:1 source (and thereabouts) to disappear into the dark. It's a wonderful experience to see your image floating in space...of course other than the red LED light for power but you can cover that if you want, it doesn't prevent the remote from working. Yes, the picture is beautiful, colours look wonderfully rich but not over-saturated, contrast level from ALL angles in my quite wide seating area is gorgeous (suffer in your jocks LCD owners!) and those blacks are just delicious. Yes I wish I had the money 5 years ago to buy a Kuro new, some people I know managed to get the KRP-500M's for $1,600 shipped just before Pioneer exited the market, but it's 2012 now and I'm pleased that I have a great option for a television. I would love to have the extra $1,000 to move to the VT50 and get 96Hz mode and the additional calibration options, but in all honesty the GT50 really delivers and from what I hear so too does the ST50 model. I got a deal on this TV where it was going to cost the same whether I chose the UT50, ST50 or GT50 (don't ask, I can't tell) so it made sense to get this one.The 3D, some discussion has been made of some ghosting but if you adjust to 48Hz mode there is none, and the 3D is really well done. Even better are Panasonic's new 2012 glasses. They might feel a little cheap but they're very comfortable, have additionally wide legs around the eyes so they do a good job of blocking out any ambient light that your TV is throwing off if that's your only light source in the room, and at $50 from Amazon they're a bargain compared to the older glasses. The new Bluetooth standard means these glasses will work with other manufacturer's sets, and so will theirs. So for $20 if you want a couple pairs of extra glasses for company the Samsung glasses are a good deal, but the Panny glasses are definitely the bee's knees for your own personal use.There is some minor image retention noticeable on these new 2012 sets when you have a logo or something very briefly on the screen then go to pitch black, but under normal viewing conditions this has not affected my enjoyment at all as it seems to be removed immediately upon viewing anything else.I don't care for 2D > 3D conversion. I tried it a few times and some stuff looks okay but anything red stands out way more than it should and really...it just pales in comparison to 3D. Pick up any of the animtated 3D Blu-ray discs like Pixar or Dreamworks stuff if you want to see how really good 3D looks. Only CON with this set is that it no longer comes with Avatar, lol. That's a good 3D demo disc also.Also I don't care for any of the apps. In fact I'd love to see Panasonic offer a top of the line above the VT series that doesn't have any fancy schmancy apps, no speakers, just a monitor like the Pioneer KRP-500M and KRP-600M, just for those that only care about picture quality. Maybe it might even be cheaper than the VT? Just an idea. For me I bought this TV only for viewing Blu-ray, broadcast HD and sometimes DVD. I would rather watch internet streaming material on my PC where the flaws in the picture aren't exacerbated as much as they are with a good display. I don't want my TV online, big brother is always looking for new ways to watch what you're doing.The new GT50 is slim and sexy, gorgeous picture, very light and has a small footprint too due to its thin bezel. Finally Panasonic makes a sexy, attractive frame/bezel! Well done Panny. I give this set full marks and recommend it highly to anyone who lists overall picture quality as one of the most important things they're looking for.Update > here are some recommended settings from D-Nice.

I previously owned a Samsung PN58A650 from around 2008 and thought it had a nice picture -- the Panasonic blows it out of the water!  Gorgeous inky blacks, amazing levels of detail EVEN IN VERY DARK SCENES (the guy who said detail was missing must have poor input signal, or a bad set) and beautiful colors.  This thing blows me away -- the picture quality is THAT MUCH BETTER than my Samsung... practically night & day.  It handles motion like nothing I've seen before.  Fast motion on the Samsung would cause some slight blurring (at least I could notice it), but you don't see anything like that on this TV.  There is absolutely no reason to buy an LED/LCD when you have something like this available.  Here are some highlights & common areas of concern:Image RetentionNone!  My old Samsung had a little bit of noticeable IR when you watched something with black bars or a static image/channel logo.  This set displays absolutely NO IR so far!Brightness PopsNone! I'm a hockey fan and haven't seen any of the brightness pops that were noticed on last years models.ReflectionsYes, the screen does reflect a little bit but this is no different than any other plasma and the vast majority of new LED sets.  That said, the picture is so bright that I really don't notice it much and it doesn't bother me -- and I have my set in a fairly bright room full of windows.Buzzing SoundNot noticeable or distracting.  I'm sitting 9 feet away from the TV and can't hear any buzzing.  If I stand right beside the TV and put my head near it, I can hear a slight electronic buzzing sound.  Big deal, I don't watch the TV on mute so I would never hear the buzzing even if I sat directly in front of it all the time.Motion HandlingThis is the #1 reason why I still won't consider an LED or LCD.  My eyes are sensitive to the motion blur and it gives me a headache.  We also own a small 32\" LCD with great picture quality, but it all goes to hell when there are fast moving objects on the screen.  I did a side by side comparison with this TV and a top-end Samsung LED.  The LED is much improved over past models, but still no where near as clear as this plasma.  This new Panasonic even blows away my old Samsung plasma.  Stanley Cup hockey playoff games are an absolute dream on this screen!One last final note -- the white glove delivery service was superb!  They arrived on time, took great care with my TV and didn't leave until it was fully connected and tested.

Kibler", "ReviewID": "R2JO3Q7VY5DZQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pre-purchase Research:About every five to seven years I buy a new television.  Unlike most people who see a set they like and buy it on the spot, I take my time and research it in depth before spending my hard earned money.  After giving it some thought I determined I wanted a television between 46 inches and 50 inches with the following features: HDTV, Smart TV, 3D, at least 3 HDMI ports and the most important thing was to get the model with the best picture quality available for my money.When I started this process my intention was to buy an LED television, but after researching it, I quickly discovered plasma still had the best picture quality (better screen uniformity, smoother action tracking and better blacks), especially if you have a dark room, which I do .  I spent about three weeks researching televisions and all roads pointed towards this model.  Cnet.com said it was one of the best televisions they tested in 2012.  The only television they said had a higher picture quality was the Panasonic VIERA TC-P55VT50, which is a step up from this television and is Panasonic's top-of-the-line model.  I considered that model, but it was approximately $900.00 more, which put it out of my price range.After two weeks of on-line research I went to my local Best Buy store to see it in person.  After entering the store I was met by a number of salesmen, who quickly demonstrated they knew a lot less than me about televisions.  I have always found this to be absolutely pathetic.  After a quick search I found the GT50 in their Magnolia Living Room area.  It was set up in a small, dimly lit room along with a Sony and a Samsung 7100 series LED.  All three were playing the same Blu-ray disc, which was a demo disc, which featured a number of clips from various movies: Sucker Punch, Jurassic Park, a few Disney cartoons, the recent Alice in Wonderland flick and a few other movies.  The first thing I noticed was that the LED TVs were far brighter, but the blacks weren't as black.  The Sony, although a great picture, tended to be a little on the blue side.  The Samsung also had a great picture, but the colors were unnaturally bright and didn't seem real when compared to the Panasonic.  The Panasonic's picture was much smoother, the blacks were deeper and the overall picture seems more real.  Soon another salesmen walked in and asked if I needed some help.  We started talking about televisions, but I didn't tell him my thoughts on any of them, I just played dumb.  After 10 minutes of talk I was somewhat impressed with his knowledge of home audio and video products.  Clearly he was not your average Best Buy employee.  Finally I asked him if he had around $1500 to spend on a television, which one would he buy.  He immediately pointed to the Panasonic GT50.  He then stated his reasons, which were all the things I had already read about on line.  I knew he was being honest because the GT50 wasn't the most expensive television.  It was actually a lot cheaper than most on display.  Normally I would expect a salesperson to try and sell me the most expensive thing they had on display, but he didn't.  Again he impressed me.  We then spoke a little more in depth and I asked him if the GT50 on display had been calibrated.  He then pointed out the fact that it wasn't even hooked up using HDMI cables and that it hadn't been calibrated.  For whatever reason, most televisions on display are hooked up using the component inputs.  Although you can get an HD picture using these, HDMI inputs produce a much higher quality picture.  Considering how it was hooked up, I really liked the picture quality and knew it could only get better from there.  So after another week of research I determined I was going to purchase this television.  Now to find the best deal.Order & Delivery:After three weeks of research and shopping I found out that Amazon had the best price, which didn't come as a surprise to me.  Brick and mortar stores claim they will match the price, but in my experience that doesn't include delivery and tax.  Amazon also gave me a fourteen day low price guarantee, free shipping with \"advanced delivery\" (includes: unboxing, set up, inspection and box/package removal), no tax, 2% back in Amazon rewards (approximately $25), and free thirty day over the phone tech support.  I couldn't find a store out there who could even come close!I ordered this television on Tuesday, November 19th, 2012 from Amazon.com.  During the check-out process they offered the delivery date of Friday, November 23rd, 2012.  I was surprised they would be delivering the day after Thanksgiving, but I was happy to schedule it for that day.  I choose delivery between 9am and 12 noon.  Later on that evening I received an email confirmation from the delivery company.  During the evening of Thursday, November 22nd, 2012 I received a reminder email from the delivery company.  Thus far I was happy with their communication.  On Friday I was up early and promptly cleaned out my entertainment center and prepared for delivery.  I waited all morning, but no TV.  At approximately 1230pm I received a phone call from Eagle.  The driver stated he was running behind schedule and should be at my home around 2pm.  He was polite and apologetic.  Around 2:30pm the delivery truck showed up and the driver installed my new TV.  He was polite, had a great deal of respect for my home and was very friendly.  He was in and out in about 30 minutes.  After he unboxed and set up the TV he and I did a quick inspection and he briefly went over the controls with me.  I then signed the delivery confirmation papers, filled out a brief survey and he was on his way.  He offered to remove the box and packing, but I opted to keep it just in case there was an issue and it had to go back (I'm sorta anal about things like that).Amazon's TV Low Price Guarantee:I purchased the television for $1295.00.  Four days later the price dropped to $1139.00.  I then phoned Amazon and spoke to a Rep.  He quickly researched the price drop and stated he would refund me the difference of $156.00, but he suggested I wait the full fourteen day period before doing that.  He further explained that I was only entitled to one price drop guarantee, so if the price dropped further in the next few days, Amazon would not refund me the difference a second time.  He then made a note on my account that I called in with the price of $1139.00, and if the price went up from there I could still call in and get that price.  I thought this was really great of him to help me out like that.  So I waited the full fourteen days and the price didn't budge one way or the other.  I made a quick call and got refunded the difference of $156.00Advanced Set-Up and Calibration:Although this set looks pretty good right out of the box, I HIGHLY recommend you calibrate it to get the best possible picture.  The THX picture setting is the best preset it has built in, but the calibration settings posted on CNET are far better.  After playing with the presets and comparing them to the settings on CNET, I decided to go with their settings, and I can't explain to you how happy I am with the picture quality of this set.Overall Performance:As I said, the picture quality is amazing.  Even though its set to 2D, a lot of new movies look like they are in 3D.  We watched Captain America (the new movie) just because the picture quality was so absolutely amazing.  I DVRed that movie and use it to demonstrate to friends the picture quality of this set, all of which have been seriously impressed.  I'm also a pretty big gamer and have an Xbox 360 and a PS3 hooked up via HDMI.  Both look amazing.  I recommend setting the picture to \"Game\" mode when gaming, but not for DVD or Blu-Ray playback.  Use the custom settings for both of them.  When set to \"Game\", the colors are accentuated and are so much brighter and really pop.  I also have a desk-top computer hooked to this set, which acts as a media server on our home network.  I have read about issues with screen burn in, so I have totally cleared off the desk-top, hidden the start bar and set the background to black.  I also set a screen saver.  I have had no issues with screen burn in and video playback looks great.Overall Assessment after Three Weeks:I couldn't be happier with this television.  The picture and build quality are top notch in its price range.  I honestly don't think you can get a better bang for your buck, and I highly recommend Amazon for this great customer service and its delivery program. You will be hard pressed to find a brick and mortar store that can even come close to what they offer.  I love this television so much that I'm actually considering buying another one for my living room.  If anything changes and I have a negative experience with this set, I'll be sure to update this review.  For now, I'm giving this set and Amazon five stars!", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "BUYER BEWARE: Panasonic Sells Faulty Technology", "Author": "Hinge", "ReviewID": "RGMAOUUE274VX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's true.  IF you use your TV at anytime as a PC/iPad/Smart Phone monitor or show other static programming as marketed by Panasonic here: >>  [...]  << you will absolutely burn in images on this particular model, and in very short order.  After two weeks of use, I was devastated to notice burn-in on my brand new plasma.  Believe me, the picture is awesome, and the last thing you would expect to see with a modern plasma is permanent, distracting, devastating burn-in - but you will. My PC is connected to the TC-P50GT50 and I used my TV off and on over two weeks to work on emails, browsing, PC gaming etc.  The \"start\" button for windows, the browser configuration, even the red \"X\" in the upper right corner of windows is indelibly burned in.  Ouch.For the record, I have purchased in excess of 80-100 Panasonic plasmas over the last nine years for restaurant use showing static programming like CNN, ESPN, MSNBC, etc for hours, days and weeks on the same TV. None of those lesser cost Plasmas have shown burn in.  Sadly the TC-P50GT50 does.So - how can I state Panasonic actually sells faulty goods?  Upon seeing the burn in, I contacted Panasonic Customer Service.  A Panasonic Customer Care representative stated that because I used the TV with static programming, burn in occurred.  Further, that because the burn in occurred, it was I that damaged the TV.  And of course, because I damaged it, the problem is not covered under warranty.  Yes - that was the exact reasoning explained (professionally and politely) to me.Naturally, I mentioned the above website (which of course is theirs) where they demonstrate \"Large-Screen Web Browsing with Your Family\".  I asked the representative if Panasonic both demonstrated and marketed static programming as proper use - how could I be the cause of damage?  There was a predictable moment of silence.  I said that by following the information and materials provided by Panasonic I exposed a faulty TV and they should either replace it with better technology or refund the purchase price.  More silence.So folks - as much as I love this Plasma TV for all the reasons outlined in numerous reviews - you must be very cautious about the burn in issue as well as Panasonic's initial stated position that the problem is ours, not theirs.There must be hundreds if not thousands of us who have called...  After 30 minutes with the original representative who followed what I am sure is the stated pretzel logic reasoning for customers with the same complaint, and twice insisting to speak with a supervisor, I was able to speak with one.  He was of little help - he too stated that the issue was not under warranty and that if I wanted, I could send in a picture of the burn in, which I did.  I have yet to hear from Panasonic in 24 hours which may or may not be reasonable.  I'll leave that up to you to decide.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Questionable Purchase Update", "Author": "Mitchell S.

I raised it from 3 stars to 4 stars. Yes it was very difficult to remove the image retention and I haven't removed it completely, tho it is better. The picture quality has improved I changed the settings from Cnet's to a setting I pick up from High Fi Junkies.

Tom", "ReviewID": "R1A85OP74QEULZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As of this review, the GT50 series is a brand new model from Panasonic that was announced at CES 2012 and just released in June 2012.By most all accounts, the GT50 series has identical picture quality as the ST50 series, yet it costs more.The reason I opted for this model is because I wanted something beautiful, even when it's turned off. The ST50 series has a plastic bezel and clear plastic frame around it that to me screams 'cheap'. Contrast that with the GT50 series, which seems to have a glass bezel and a nice metal accent around that, instead of clear plastic.. It is a more sleek design and more says- 'high end', although I'll admit, to someone who is not paying attention to that, they may not notice much difference.Also, while I don't care that much about THX certification myself (I typically go online and look for the best settings to use and manually input those), that is a selling point for when you ever sell the TV later; you could sell it for more because it's a \"THX\" model. Also, the built in THX presets can be useful. For example, I sometimes do use the THX bright setting sometimes when I'm watching the TV in the mid-day and it's bright in my living room.  If you don't want to mess around with custom settings, you can use the THX settings for a 'one click' calibration with very nice results.The GT50 also adds one more HDMI input port, which is handy so you can plug in up to 4 different devices such as an AppleTV or Roku box without having to invest in an HDMI switcher box.The picture quality on this plasma TV is nothing sort of astounding and I could not be happier with my purchase of this TV! If you are a cinephile, plasma is still the way to go for sure as it offers the best picture quality, even off angle (whereas LCDs have a 'sweet spot' where they look good but if you move away from that, the brightness diminishes).The internet streaming features with the built in wifi work and look great. I've tried Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube and Vudu all with excellent results.My only complaint is that there is a slight buzzing sound which comes from the back of the panel, especially during bright scenes. This is apparently quite normal for plasma TVs and most will not notice it during normal usage. I'm knocking one star off my rating for this reason as I wish it was totally silent although this should not deter you from getting a plasma HDTV since the picture quality is a lot better than LED LCD for movies and overall.You might be thinking what about the VT series? Well, at the time of this review, those are a lot more expensive which was cost prohibitive for me, yet giving only minor benefits. Also, the remote on the VT50 is a circular touchpad which seems a bit fiddly and may not be as easy to control. Also note, the GT50 is capable of a bit of a brighter picture than the VT50 series. This could make a difference in a room with windows.So, while the cheaper ST50 series represents a better value than the this GT50, my view is that the few hundred extra for the GT50 series is worth it for the reasons outlined above. It is a bit of a tough call but in my case, it was worth it to spend the extra.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "The research is over - what a superb TV", "Author": "Red House", "ReviewID": "R1HKBNVJGNQVP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So many choices, so little time!  One of the highest rated values out there and now I can see why.  For the money spent, this set is just right in terms of features, size, quality, and ease of use.  I've had this TV for a few weeks now and have really put it through its paces - it is stunning.  The 3D part of it was something I figured would be a gadgety thing that wasn't so good - wrong.  The 3D is exceptional - we watched the IMAX Tahiti surfing movie and for the first time ever watching anything in 3D, something actually seemed to be coming out of the screen at me.  There was no annoying blur.  Not over the top, but definitely a nice effect.  I had only bought two sets of glasses as a hedge, now we'll be buying them for the whole family.There is no buzzing noise that some have complained about with plasmas, the TV is super thin, the blacks are amazingly rich, including in the shadows.  For us, 50\" was just right for the room we have it in, but I can see why people go bigger if they can.  The remote is easy, the menu and setup are easy, the internet streaming features included are handy, although it took a little while to find the option to turn off the annoying beep when navigating through them (it's on the setup within the Viera tools).Just a tremendous purchase, I really can't say enough good things about it!Update on 3-5-2013:  it's been almost a year now and I love this TV more than ever.

GREAT PRICE!", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R204TU9PM8RRQ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing a lot of research and reading countless reviews I decided to pull the trigger on the 55GT50.  My previous TV was/is a 46\" Samsung LCD from 2006.  I was all set to order a new Samsung LED, but after reading several reviews and 2 trips to BB I decided to go with this Panasonic plasma instead.AMAZON 10/10:The first one that was delivered had a power issue (turned off after about 15-20 minutes and went into safe mode).  Amazon was GREAT and had a replacement at my house 2 days later.  The second one works perfectly!!  Just a side note, neither one had any buzzing issues.PICTURE 9/10:The picture is amazing!!  The colors are very deep and the blacks are unlike anything I've ever seen on any LCD.  It is slightly darker or warmer than an LCD, but after you get used to it, LED's actually appear to be too bright.  I have the TV mounted on the wall above the fireplace in a fairly bright and open living room.  When the sun is shining directly into the window behind the couch, there is a glare on the screen, but when the TV is on it's not too noticeable.  My LCD also suffered from a glare when the sun was shining directly into that window.  I rated the picture 9/10 only because the custom settings that I found online (see below) are far better than the THX settings.  I highly recommend using the settings below or at least trying them.  I have had no issues with IR or burn in and I did not do any of the crazy break-in procedures that are posted all over the internet.  Time will tell, but so far so good.FEATURES 8/10:It has everything and more than I need or use.  The only thing I wish that it had was the ability to enter more than 1 custom setting per HDMI port.  A custom day and night setting would be ideal (available on the VT model).SOUND 9/10:It actually has decent sound for being so thin.  I use a sound bar, but it still sounds good without it on.DESIGN 9/10:The design is thin, pleasing to the eye, and looks great on the wall.  The VT gets a 10/10.I am very pleased with my purchase and for the price tag it\u2019s really a no brainer in my opinion.

After installing it, I found that the TV speakers would intermittently lose most of their volume and the sound quality would degrade singificantly.  The problem happened for both cable TV (RG6 cable) and from the attached DVD (composite video).  I changed cables and tried different cable/DVD devices, but when the TV warmed up, the sound would get very poor.  In order to even hear it you had to raise the volume fo ~80, rather than the ~25-30 when the set was cold.  The sound quality was similar to a toddler's audio book rather than a $1500 piece of electronics.I called Panasonic, and they put me through ~1 hour of cable swapping and other troubleshooting, to no avail.  The agent asked me to swap out cables and DVD players again, and to change some audio settings on the TV and see if things were better.  After using the TV for a few more days, there was no change.  On the next call to Panasonic, they asked me to move DVD players and try HDMI.  I said I had done this and that it worked for a while but then degraded, just as the other connections, but I did the swap anyway and the sound was fine for a couple of minutes.  The agent then said that this proved that it was not a TV problem.  The only choice I had was to hire a TV technician on my dime to come in and prove that there actually was a problem with the TV.  Depending on the TV Technician's statement they would consider dealing with it as a warranty issue.I even talked to a supervisor and he indicated that the TV was working to specification.  This convinced me that I had no desire to deal with Panasonic support in the future.I did not call a TV technician, I called Amazon and they are taking the TV back without any hassle.  I am sorry that Amazon has to suffer the cost impact of this return, when reasonable customer service from Panasonic would probably have solved the problem with a simple warranty dispatch.FYI.

I had purchased a Panasonic BluRay player that had the Viera menu on it, and have been downloading movies and other content for a while now through the player.  This TV upgrades the whole experience, and integrates very well with my current setup.  I chose the 2012 60\" GT50 model because it fits into the cabinet space I have, and it supports a THX mode.I was a bit leery of the price differential between this model and the ST50, but I am really glad I got the GT model.  By the time the product shipped, the price differential was just about half of what it was when these models first started appearing in stores and on the web.  I took advantage of Amazon's price guarantee to get a pretty substantial refund, gotta love that!  I have been an Amazon customer for a long time now and have become totally at ease with buying on the site, even big-ticket items.  Their customer service combined with Prime is better than slugging it out in the big box stores, in my opinion.  My advice to anyone considering applying for a price guarantee refund is to carefully read the instructions and program description available on the Amazon web site ahead of time, just to avoid potential misunderstandings down the road.  It is a great program, but does have rules you have to pay attention to.The picture is so good on this set that even commercials are mesmerizing.  I had evaluated LED sets, and the \"soap opera\" effect and color bleed were very noticeable to me, to the point of distraction.  I think the older LCD technology looks more realistic.

I have the other devices hooked into a Pioneer Elite 7.1 receiver, and am only using one of the 4 HDMI inputs to the TV.  Seems to work fine, I have no reason thus far to change the setup.The screen is more reflective than the old DLP set, so for example at night if you have a floor or table lamp on, you will definitely see its reflection on the screen unless you turn off the light or move to an angle where the reflection is out of the field of view.  My family room is pretty bright in the daytime, with a window facing west, but as long as we draw that one curtain, the picture looks fine. There is a bright room setting, but I haven't been motivated to use it to deal with the ambient light.I did try out the built-in audio on the TV, and I must say, I was impressed.  The speakers must be very small or low profile to fit in the unit, but the sound was surprisingly strong, partly because the TV is inside a fairly large cabinet, and probably takes advantage of the acoustics from the cabinet.  There is a setting somewhere in the menus that lets you set the TV as being against the wall or in the cabinet, and it probably adjusts the audio settings appropriately.However, since I use the audio from the receiver, I just turned the TV audio off in the menus, and everything just plays well together.  The power button and other controls on the TV remote is now linked to the receiver and BluRay player, an nice unanticipated surprise.  These devices all talk to each other, so you can control the TV from other remotes and vice versa.  My old TV, by comparison, was pretty \"dumb.\"  Seems like I always had to use 3 remotes.I have watched some 2D Blu Ray movies (e.g. Avatar, Master & Commander), and the experience even in 2D is amazing!  I fiddled around with the video controls, which appear to be extensive, and then simply chose the TXC Cinema setting, and voila!  I thought the picture looked the best in that mode of all of the built-in choices.  I set the temperature setting to the one right below \"Warm\" (I think it is called Cool2 or something), there are 5 levels available.  Not sure exactly what they are for, but my assumption is that the cooler the setting, the less likely you'll get any image burn-in.  I am thinking about having the set calibrated, or buying a DVD and doing it myself, but honestly, I will probably just leave it alone in THX mode and enjoy the view.The DLNA interface was new to me, but once I figured out how it works, it was very easy to connect other computers on my home network to the TV so I can view videos and pictures stored anywhere on the network.  DLNA is super easy to set up, I will definitely upgrade to a NAS device like Synology and move our content onto the one device and get it organized.  The other really cool thing is that your smart phone can connect to the TV and you can play back pics and videos you have on the phone.I enjoy the internet functions and apps, have already installed a bunch from the Viera web site.  Everything with streaming media seems to work fine, no issues thus far.  Entering data via the remote is sort of a pain, so I am thinking about getting a compatible wireless keyboard.  I tried the TV browser, and it is pretty fast, but seems to have limitations - not all the content is displayed on certain web sites - perhaps it has to do with flash content, not sure.  I was able to log into my Outlook account via webmail on the browser on the TV and read email messages.  That seemed to work fine, though I won't use it much, just curious to see if it works.  Moving the cursor via the remote is not smooth - it is easy to miss the target.We've also hooked up an HP laptop with an HDMI interface to the TV to watch a PBS series not available on the other sources yet, and the picture was excellent.  I have noticed that lower resolution images like from an analog cable channel actually look better on this TV than they did on the DLP set I had - they were pretty blurry on that, but are much clearer on this set.I plan on trying out the 3D, but I haven't bought the glasses yet.  Comcast is supposedly going to offer 3D content pretty soon in my area, and I might purchase a 3D Blu Ray player, so I'll provide an update when I get that far.I have not experienced any of the negative issues noted by some other reviewers - the TV doesn't buzz at all, there is no snow, and I have not yet noticed the automatic dimming issue others have complained about when watching scenes with a lot of white or light colors.Overall, I have to say I am absolutely delighted with the TV thus far and think it was well worth the money just for the picture quality, let alone all of the other features.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Price vs Performance, this is the best.", "Author": "darc87 \"darc87\"", "ReviewID": "R1P19K14M0EYTG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to replace my broken Samsung HLR-5688 DLP TV.

Well no fear, they are fine. Great colors and good brightness. Is an LED brighter and sharper when viewed straight on? Sure they are. But these are fine and bright enough for most everyone. Also I prefer the glass panel and colors the more i look at it and do not have any remorse about not getting an LED TV. Also for the size, 65\", the price is great.1. Off angle viewing fantastic. Can see from the dinner table just fine.2. Thin and mounts on a stand easily. So can easily tilt and swivel as needed. ZLine TV stand. If stand says it supports 150 pounds than no issue. This TV 65\" weighs 121.3 pounds without stand which is not used with this mount.3. Bright enough and great colors. The more viewed the better liked.4. For 65\" high end TV, great price and LED cannot match this for the price.5. Internet apps fast and easy to use. Amazon instant video with prime membership, great deal. This app actually works better than my PS3 app. Picture seems bigger and sharper and smoother buffering.6. 3D viewing more immersive with a bigger TV. Do not be afraid to go big. As big as your space can fit. As long as your are 8ft back no problem.7. Metal edge trim is a nice touch. Looks very nice and makes a difference esthetically.8. I like the presets as for me they are handy for picture.9. The remote is well designed and easy to use. No complaints.I have no regrets. Just wish my space was bigger and they made an even bigger one. The width of the TV just fit in the spot i have it. I am about 8 to 8.5 feet back and i, my wife and son love it.

In fact it doesn't even seem that big anymore. My wife asked a few times \"are you sure that is 65 inches?\". And she is the one who was worried about it overpowering the room.

Jacobson", "ReviewID": "R38KSVJY8Q54IB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased a P60GT50 from a brick and mortar retailer and received it on Nov 17th.  I had done a lot of research and decided this was the ideal TV for my price range, being one of the top rated flatscreens for 2012.  The store I bought from had already matched Amazon's price, and offered free delivery and 3 year no interest financing on the store card.Setup was easy, and the options are diverse.We watched 'Brave' that evening, and later on I watched some regular TV.  Overall, I was less than pleased with the results.The first problem I had was that the TV set was just too dark.  'Brave' required us to use THX Bright Room mode even when viewing in a completely dark room, or turn Brightness up on other modes, and even this wasn't completely adequate.  The black levels were very deep - too deep, because a lot of subtle detail was lost to pitch black.  Perhaps a proper calibration can resolve this, but until then none of the modes were too useful.  3D was unwatchable, and dark scenes in games were unplayable.Regular TV viewing was OK in Standard mode with the lights on, but felt too dim.  Later that night, I noticed that the set buzzed loudly enough to be heard across the room when displaying scenes with a lot of white, sometimes over the actual show (most notable watching WW2 documentaries on the military channel).Initially I noticed a surreal effect that is better known as the 'soap opera' effect, while watching classic WW2 movies.  During scenes with little motion but a single character or two, or during panning scenes with large foreground objects, those characters and objects seemed to 'pop' more, becoming more sharp and crystal clear than the rest of the picture.  Eventually I discovered this was due to the motion smoother.  A neat feature, for sure, but if you aren't expecting it, it can be disconcerting.The next day, Sunday, I called Panasonic's customer service - buying a Viera gets you access to a priority customer service line (I called the regular one first before finding the number while on hold, called the Viera line and was connected pretty quickly).  Panasonic has customer service 7 days a week, with pretty decent hours.  After we walked through performing a reset of the TV and the buzz was still evident, they said it might be a bad board and scheduled a repair for Friday the 23rd.I decided to continue playing with the TV, and played some Skyrim.  I noticed that the during scenes with a lot of white colors, those areas appeared to flicker.  My wife could see it too, but only if she wasn't looking directly at the TV.  Direct viewing for more than an hour could make me nauseous.So, given the buzzing and flicker, I went back to the store to exchange it for a different GT50.  While there I noticed that ALL of the plasma TVs flicker to me; this isn't something I noticed before, but once I was aware of it I couldn't not see it.  Thus, I am exchanging it for an LED (Panasonic L55WT50, which I got on sale for less than the P60GT50).I give the GT50 4 stars because overall the picture is great, but it isn't perfect.  The much touted 24,576 shades of gradation were not too evident.  The buzzing may have been a unit-specific issue (a salesman at the store said if I heard buzzing it was defective and should be exchanged), but it is obviously an issue that can occur within the model line.  I do not knock it for the flicker - this is something evident to me on all Plasmas, and just something I am personally sensitive to.I really wanted to like this TV more and keep it, but it appears Plasma is just not for me.  Everything I disliked about it was fairly typical for plasmas, either the technology (flicker, darker picture) or common to various units (buzzing).", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Docked A Star For Lack Of Zoom Control.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R16YV5ESAIUVOU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My 55GT50 just arrived a half hour before I had to leave for work, and worked perfectly after set-up.  It took 9 days to arrive from Amazon.  The deliverer was an older man who wasn't familiar with this TV.  He helped me bring it into the front door.  Then he helped me lift my 50\" 2009 LG off my ZVOX base, and move the old TV into the guest bedroom.  Then he helped me assemble the 55GT50.  (My power screwdriver was helpful.  The 8+1 base to TV screws have lots of turns.  BTW, the fit and finish of the screw hole connections were perfect.)  Then he told me he had keep delivering so I signed for it and let him go.

Then I connected it to my system, turned it on with the remote, (which included two AA batteries BTW)  Initially the TV made me go through a ritual initial set-up.My first impression of the picture quality:  It has very deep blacks with good shadow detail from my DISH receiver.  Also a tad bit dim, as you would expect from a plasma TV.  It had great color saturation.  I haven't had time to fiddle with the controls yet.  I am leaving it on while I go to work.  I zoomed the fox channel (using Dish remote),in order to not have a station identifiction burned into my new TV.  By comparison, my 50\" Sam's Club LG TV's first impression was that of a too much green push, which I had to tame down with picture adjustments and break-in time.

There is no annoying 'soap opera' effect, which I've learned is actually caused by the additional--computer generated--frames of film that high refresh rate TV's (especially 240+ hz LED's) insert between frames of the original footage in order to make motions onscreen appear more fluid.I returned a comparable LG plasma TV (60PM9700) before purchasing this Viera and the difference is huge.

Set up was as simple as assembling the stand (5 minutes) and getting an extra hand to help me lift the TV onto the stand and then onto the entertainment center. After agonizing over the ST50, I ultimately ended up choosing the GT50 for the 4th HDMI slot and the built-in THX modes. I did not want the hassle of calibrating and I had read other reviews that stated the THX modes were great out of the box, and indeed they are. It was wonderful to be able to use it immediately without the hassle of calibration. Built-in wifi is also a huge plus and was a cinch to set up. It is in the same room as my router and is pulling 35-38mbps which is plenty for HD streaming. Aside from a few tweaks in the settings, such as removing the channels I don't utilize and removing the ads, I was ready to go.I am utilizing all 4 of the HDMI slots for my PS3, Xbox 360, Apple TV and a spare cable for my HD laptop for PC gaming on the big screen. Everything I have thrown at this TV has looked spectacular. I have been re-watching some of my favorite wildlife documentaries just to experience them in the beautiful HD. Panasonic provides a nifty little adapter for your composite cables as well so that's where the Wii ended up. All of the games and movies we have tried look simply gorgeous. My kiddo is a big Cars fan so we've logged quite a few hours playing Cars 2 on the Xbox and watching Cars and Cars 2 in Blu-Ray and with the 2D->3D conversion on, I feel like I can reach out and touch McQueen!I had an older Panasonic which was one of the first Smart TVs and didn't have as many useful features as this one. I love the built-in Netflix with the dedicated Netflix button on the remote. It's true that every single device I have plugged into the TV is capable of Netflix as well, but it's so much more convenient to just push the Netflix button and be there with one remote. The Hulu channel is also great and I was very happy to see Amazon Instant Video here as well. Having the ability to rent movies right from the remote is fantastic. You truly get a full suite of video entertainment built right in with the streaming movies, TV shows and movie rentals at your finger tips. Set up for these channels was a breeze and we were up and running with all of them in minutes.Among the other channels is a Skype channel (can't say I'd use this often, if ever) and an internet browser. I glanced right past the browser initially, automatically assuming it would be plagued by the same issues as all other add-on device browsers, namely slow, clunky interface and lack of flash support. This browser, however, has a speedy interface and working flash!! It's not as good as just plugging in my laptop and using my mouse and keyboard to navigate, but for those times when I just want to check something without having to get up and plug in the laptop, this browser is pretty decent. I was able to load up Hulu.com and start streaming The Office in seconds. I read the top review here on Amazon, however, and noted that he claimed he had to download the browser and enter his credit card info. I did not have to do any of this. When I first went to the Internet section (where the browser and other apps are located) it prompted me to update the software, which I did. It took a few minutes and that was it. I was able to use the browser (which was already present without a separate download) and was not prompted to enter any info of any kind. Just wanted to clear that up!There is a game/app channel as well, and aside from a brief peek inside, I haven't bothered with it. I am already too invested in other gaming systems to dump more money into another gaming ecosystem. It's nice for those who just want a few casual games, but I would rather buy something off Xbox Marketplace or Steam with my hard-earned money. That's just my opinion! All the other popular apps you would get with the Roku or Apple TV are available for download from the Viera connect store as well. Pandora, Tune In, Ustream and YouTube are my favorites, but I noticed a number of sports and specialty TV apps as well, including anime and adult content (which thankfully can be disabled via settings). Most of these require a paid subscription, but there was one really cute app designed specifically for kids that has a fairly good-sized library of completely kid-appropriate cartoons and is totally free. You won't find Spongebob or anything Disney here as these all appear to be \"indie\" style and many are only a few minutes long. However, not all of them were unknown as we found several that Nick Jr. airs between shows, such as Danny & Daddy. The interface is super simple so my kiddo really enjoys exploring this channel for new things to watch. All the apps we've used so far are superb. We are planning for an upcoming trip to Disneyland so one of my son's favorite activities is watching videos of the rides on YouTube. The app is really easy to navigate and I really like the auto-play feature that automatically goes to the next related video. The Netflix app also has this feature if you are watching a video from a series. Nifty!I was skeptical about the 2D->3D conversion upon ordering and assumed I'd probably not use it, opting to only view true 3D content. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it actually works quite well. Clearly it's not going to be as impressive as content that was designed for 3D, but for being an on-the-fly conversion, it's actually pretty great. Everything we have watched or played with the 3D conversion has been really nice. Via our Apple TV, we're even able to play our iOS games in 3D!! My 7-year-old absolutely loves this, as do I. Switching between 2D and 3D is as simple as pushing a button on the remote. Awesomely simple.My only complaint regarding the 3D is that I can't figure out how to activate it when viewing Panasonic's built-in apps, such as Netflix or Hulu. When you are \"in\" one of these apps, it disables the 3D button on the remote. I can only imagine that this was by design, but I can't figure out why. So if we want to watch Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, etc, in 3D, we have to utilize our Apple TV which will then let me activate the 3D button on the remote once again. If I'm missing something, please let me know! I can't access the 3D button or the Viera tools button when in one of the native apps. Not a huge deal for me as I have access to these via my other devices, but for someone hoping to watch Netflix in 3D right out of the box, they may be disappointed.It's also worth mentioning that the TV does not come with 3D glasses. I realize that the Samsung TVs do, but the Samsung glasses are also far cheaper than the Panasonic glasses, so it's not really an issue for me. I picked up a pair of the Samsung 3D glasses and they work flawlessly with the GT50. They synced up immediately upon turning them on, no set up required. Very nice. However, if you are planning to use the 3D more than a couple hours a week, I recommend picking up the Panasonic glasses for one reason: batteries! The Samsungs have about a 6 hour battery life, after which you have to throw down $3 for another battery. Gets pricey when you have a family of glasses all running at the same time. I figured with 3 hours of use per day, I would spend the $40 I saved over buying the Panasonic glasses in batteries alone after one month of use. The Panasonics have a USB rechargeable battery that can charge right from your TV. I don't regret buying the Samsung glasses as I'd rather my little ones use the cheaper glasses, but I definitely recommend the rechargeable glasses for more heavy use.I really appreciate the energy saving options, although the eco picture quality is understandably terrible. I opted to set the automatic off options and stay away from eco mode as it just looks dark and muddy. The THX modes, however, are stunning and are easily accessed and swapped via the Viera tools button, which brings up a little menu at the bottom of the screen with various options, including 2D/3D and the THX/Eco modes. The room I placed the GT50 in is fairly bright throughout the day and on THX Bright Room setting, the colors are bright and vibrant and gorgeous. I was slightly concerned about this as I've heard plasmas tend to struggle in bright light, but not this baby! The blacks are also very deep and dark scenes are surprisingly crisp and clear. One of my peeves from my old TV (a 10-year-old 42\" Hitachi) was the complete inability to see dark scenes during daylight. I have room-darkening shades in the room with the Hitachi because I have no choice, but the GT50 laughs at room-darkening shades!There really isn't anything that I don't like about the GT50, but I was kind of put off by the ads. They are very simple to turn off, but I was just annoyed at being pestered by ads from Panasonic after I had just spent this much on one of their  TVs. It popped up a banner on the bottom every time we used the volume buttons. It seemed a little cheesy to me. But again, easy to turn off and you're done!Love, love, LOVE this TV, and so glad I chose this over the ST50. It was worth it for the time-saving THX modes and extra HDMI port. Buy this baby!! You won't regret it! :)", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Picture AND Best Quality", "Author": "Tariq Gibran Hamid", "ReviewID": "R18S6N4MMOWN95", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally!  After months of trying no less than three different LCD (LED lit) Tv's - each one either failing completely (Vizio E601i) or suffering from some other fault (a Sharp 60LE640U with pathetic WiFi reception and no way to completely turn off motion smoothing effects resulting in a subtle Soap Opera Effect with all content), I found as close as I think I will find to my perfect TV solution.  I actually tried a Panasonic VT25 Plasma a number of years ago and the GT50 is a major improvement over that generation.  It's lighter, it's thinner (really no difference in thickness as compared to edge lit LED's) yet it appears to be built just as well with a full metal back and gorgeous aesthetics, unlike the cheap, all plastic backed LCD's today.  The one major hesitation I had before my purchase of the GT50 was a fear that the surface would be too reflective for my fairly bright room which has a bank of six foot windows directly in front of the TV, though there is never any direct sun as these windows face south.  Unfortunately, looking at the high end Panasonic Plasmas at Best Buy was of no help as they are always on display in the Magnolia cave where there is no way to judge reflection.  Fortunately, the reflection issue was not a problem.  Yes, the screen is glossy but it has a very good anti-reflection filter built into it which substantially subdues most reflections (though you would not want a direct light source in front, such as a lamp).  Furthermore, this Panasonic Plasma is much, much brighter than the older plasmas which helps to overcome indirect, ambient light.  So, I do think this is perhaps one of the first plasma generations (the Panasonics) that are suitable for just about any location as long as it's not a ridiculously bright room.  If one is dealing with a really bright room, a matte LCD is still the way to go (as a side note, I looked at a number of fairly glossy LCD's, such as those from LG and this Panasonic has less glare than those.  The LG glossy/ glass screens seem to have poor to no anti-reflection built in filters.  Sharp seems to make the very best matte screens with decent blacks.  The high end Sony's also appeared to have a decent anti-reflection filter built in).Picture quality wise, the Panasonic GT50 is just amazing.  Compared to any LED lit LCD I tried, the image displayed by the GT50 just looks so much more dimensional and organic, not artificial like LCD.  Simply put, it looks more life-like.  Colors are real and natural and blacks are BLACK.  None of that awful clouding, flash-lighting or gray blacks one sees with edge lit LED's...nor any issues with washed out images when one is not sitting directly in front.  Anywhere is the \"sweet spot\" with a plasma!  The one single drawback I have noticed - and in my opinion it's waay overblown unless you are a big hockey fan!- is that an all white screen will not be white, but gray.  Interestingly, if say 60-70% or so of the image is white, it will be displayed as white.  Above a certain point, there is a limiter that kicks in which restricts the amount of power used (and a bright screen on a plasma uses the most power).  Anyway, the only time I have ever seen this effect is during certain commercials which show an all white image.  Never have I observed the effect during an actual movie or TV show.  The other issue one hears (literally) a lot about is plasma buzzing.  I heard it on the VT25 I tried a few year ago but I have only heard it with the GT50 thus far with my ear at the back of the set, never from my viewing position in front.  I have read where others mention hearing it from 12 ft away but I suspect they must have had a defective set.  Finally, often mentioned with regard to Plasma's is image retention/ burn in.  My set's very new - and I have not noticed any issues yet - but I'm certainly keeping an eye on it.  It's said that for the first 100-200 hours of plasma use, one should be careful to not watch programming that does not fill the entire screen, leave static images up for too long, watch programming that leaves a constant logo in the same spot and so on.  Anyway, I'm taking all these precautions and will revise my rating if I notice any issues.  For now, this TV produces the best image I have ever seen displayed on a TV.  Until OLED's are proven and drop dramatically in price (7-10yrs?), I think plasma offers the best obtainable image quality, certainly for the money.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bzzzzzzzz", "Author": "J.

I'm glad I got it although it's pricier being a newer model.  Get it now if you can!TV EXPERIENCE:Initially, I was looking at getting a 42\" plasma, not necessarily with 3D.  After doing some research and considering the living room setup, the 50\" was the ideal max size for me.  Overall, the TV experience on my Panasonic is fantastic.  If you read through my Amazon experience, I had to wait for my GT to arrive due to a shipping issue.  During the wait time for my GT to arrive, I had actually gotten a temporary Magnavox LED TV.  Compared to the LED right out of the box and on default settings, yes the plasma did seem a little darker but really the darker factor isn't an issue at all as some people make it out to be.  With playoff hockey going on, it was great to test out both TVs - the plasma wins out easily.  Colors were great and although I didn't test the black levels, I'm confident that the GT is going to shine in that area.  The sound from the built in speakers is also solid.  I can't wait to hook up the TV to my home theater components (Denon AVR-2312CI receiver (Denon AVR2312CI Integrated Network A/V Surround Receiver) and Energy Take Classic home theater speakers (Energy 5.1 Take Classic Home Theater System (Set of Six, Black))).3D:Although 3D hasn't taken off, and there isn't consensus which 3D technology will be the one that moves forward (ie active vs pass, especially with newer passive 3D TVs out this year), I took the risk and went 3D.  Active 3D technologies have better resolution so hopefully that will end up being the norm if 3D ever takes off . . .  Also in shopping around it seemed to me that most new higher end TV models had 3D in their models, and it didn't seem to add that much more in terms of cost if they did have non-3D models available.As the P50GT50 is a 3D TV, I got a few related things to test out after some additional research into 3D Blu-Rays. Thanks to an Amazon lightning deal a few days prior, I now had a 320GB PS3 to play such things on.  I ordered 2 pairs of 3D glasses (TY-ER3D4MU, which DO NOT come with the TV unfortunately), Tangled (Tangled (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)), and IMAX: The Ultimate Wave (IMAX: The Ultimate Wave - Tahiti [Blu-ray 3D]).  I wish I could've picked up an Avatar 3D Blu-Ray but due to licensing deals you cannot really do so, and Panasonic didn't have a 2012 3D bundle yet :(  After a quick charge of the glasses and popping in the 3D Blu-Ray, all I can say is the 3D experience is great.  The experience was very immersive and everything was silky smooth.  The living room setup isn't really made to have a bigger TV, but as I was watching the 3D content, I couldn't help but think how much more immersive it may be if I had gone with a larger size.As a note, and as mentioned in some other reviews either for this TV, or for the Panasonic VIERA TY-ER3D4MU Active Shutter 3D Eyewear glasses, the 3D glasses that are used for this 2012 TV are different from previous year models and previous models' glasses will not work for this TV.  This 2012 P50GT50 conforms to the new 3D glasses standard so in the near future one should be able to use the active 3D glasses on various manufacturers sets.APPS ON VIERA CONNECTI had hooked up my TV via an ethernet cable to my router when I tried the various apps.  Menus were responsive.  I didn't try out all of the apps but I did try Netflix and Amazon Instant.  The setup was straightforward for both and everything seemed to work seamlessly.  Without a keyboard on the TV remote, plus with other mobile devices, I really don't see myself doing too much with social networking apps (Facebook, Twitter) so I can't say how those work.  I would like to try out the Skype app one day, but I'm not about to spend more money on a camera just yet.VIERA CONNECT MOBILE APP:I downloaded the Viera Connect remote application for my phone (Samsung Galaxy S2) and my wife's iPad.  There are some minor app flaws (eg spelling errors, could be more aesthetically pleasing), but overall the app works well on both devices.  The remote app connected seamlessly with the TV, and allowed easy streaming of media (videos, images, and music), in addition to all the remote functions - changing volume/channel, options, etc.  Combined with having the Xfinity app on our devices, perhaps one day we will ditch the actual remotes that came with our TV and cable box!AMAZON EXPERIENCE:As usual, Amazon ordering was easy.  The TV was eligible for free shipping being a prime member and it looked like it would only take 2-3 days till delivery which would be perfect for my schedule.  Also, I would be able to select a delivery time - awesome!! (especially since my wife and I were moving into a new place and I wanted to take delivery during our move-in) I selected a Saturday morning delivery time slot during my ordering process (Tuesday).  The other option wasn't that bad but I'd rather schedule when I order than have to wait for the deliverers in my area to call me once they got the item and were ready to schedule a delivery.  Tracking my order online, the TV was actually in my area by Thursday and probably could have been delivered Thursday afternoon or Friday had I really wanted it sooner!The TV was delivered within the scheduled 3 hour window on Saturday as promised.  The TV arrived but disappointly when the deliverers opened the box for the big reveal, the screen was broken . . . . not just a little crack, but some major crackage on the screen :(  I'm guessing at some point during shipping it must have gotten knocked over pretty hard.  Needless to say, we refused to accept the package so the shippers took it back.  Since it was my first experience with having damaged items, I contacted Amazon customer support.  They sent another TV out right away to replace the damaged unit and said they would take care of the return shipping logistics.  Unfortunately, this time I couldn't request a delivery timeframe.  The fact that Amazon was immediately shipping another unit and taking care of the return logistics was great in my books and really all that I needed.  I'm glad to say the replacement came in a few days once again and thankfully there were no issues with the replacement package.  It's too bad Amazon couldn't do a little more and comp something for the inconvenience that the broken TV caused, but I guess that's the fantasy world that we all live in.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV !", "Author": "Jaivathan", "ReviewID": "RLURCKMF5N3PF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV last week and have just installed it.

For a long time I have begrudged paying that cable fee for so little in return and found commercial programming to be annoyingly short on actual programming. Well, I still had that old huge analog set, so taking the first step to change was daunting.First, LED or plasma? I really liked the brightness of the LED picture but my kids raved about plasma being more life-like, etc. I went back and forth, settling on the LED as being right for me. My son sat down with me and explained all of the feature options, told me what I should buy to get the very best, and showed me a price tag around $3500. Wow, not going to happen for the little time I spend watching TV. My son held my hand and assured me that I could adjust the plasma picture to my liking. I said \"OK, do it\" and had him place the order for me. I couldn't do the deed myself, knowing how much was involved in the entire process and that this was only the beginning.The 60\" plasma was delivered, unpacked and powered to blue screen by the delivery crew. Wow, did I really order something that huge? I was shocked and a little scared, but it was here so it was time to get rolling. I purchased a new receiver to accommodate the HDMI devices and my sound system. Added a power conditioner to protect my investment and needed some cables. I ordered a Winegard FV-HD30 antenna and installed it myself near the edge of my patio cover, probably the lowest point of my roof and on the opposite side from the local broadcast towers in the Phoenix area. Did a channel scan and found over 40 channels, including all the major networks and additional ones that I did not receive with cable, like World, Life and classical music broadcast by our local PBS affiliate. I attached the coax cable from the antenna to the existing cable TV lines to bring antenna signal to all rooms formerly served by cable, leaving the internet cable untouched. Amazingly clear, crisp picture with this HD signal direct from the towers. Was I finished spending money now?I went to my son's house and played with his Roku and Boxee Box to see if I wanted to use one of those streaming devices, also gave Netflix a test drive. The decision... I liked the simplicity of Netflix and the library of movies, documentaries, and TV shows was more than enough to entertain me for a long time. (FYI, the library is much more extensive than the covers that appear on the screen. I use rotten tomatoes to find movies and then search to locate them on Netflix. I use my laptop to build a playlist, much easier than using the remote to search from the TV). The P60GT50 connects directly to Netflix, (with a router connection, of course)so no additional device is needed. For about $8 per month, I am set.I tired various picture options that were pre-set but found all of them too dark for my liking. I picked a couple that were close and tweaked the settings slightly to get a picture that is bright and vivid. I am totally amazed at how absolutely gorgeous the image is. It is almost like the people are actually in my room.

I'd heard some bad stuff: flickering, image retention, and all manner of problems. However, after purchasing this TV and using it for almost 3 weeks, I'm nothing but enthralled! I'll go over some of the finer points:PROS- Amazing black levels! I had no idea what I was missing from inferior TVs until I saw this picture in action. I literally cannot see a difference between a black screen and the bezel, even in the dark!- Incredible color reproduction! Subtle things that may go unnoticed when watching another TV are out in vivid, accurate color. Even watching highly compressed video (like Amazon streaming or Netflix) looks amazing. On other TVs, certain shades of skin color or grey may be slightly tinted green or magenta, but not on this TV!- Doesn't flicker in any noticeable or annoying way! Because of the nature of plasma screens, flicker is inevitable (similar to old CRT computer monitors), but it's practically unnoticeable. At first, I noticed some flicker (because I was used to the several LCD TVs I have), but that went away after a couple days and I honestly didn't see it at all anymore. It is definitely better than a 60Hz refresh rate on a CRT monitor, and feels about the same as an 85Hz refresh rate. I am VERY sensitive to flicker (get headaches under fluorescent lights, etc), but this display is solid!- Great reflection reduction! I hate, hate, HATE glossy screens because they reflect so much light and really cause strain watching content for long periods, but even under semi-bright room conditions, there is virtually no glare! I actually have a table light directly parallel to the screen, but even when it's on full-blast, I don't see it except in very dark scenes. Direct sunlight is somewhat problematic, but that's easy to control in my home, so if you have a bright room flooded by sunlight, you may not be happy with this screen.- ZERO image retention!!! I was sooooo nervous that this would be a problem, as I've heard so many horror stories. I was very cautious at first, making sure I didn't watch too much letterboxed/sideboxed content or play video games without spending 2x longer watching full-screen content. But after a week or so (without experiencing even the HINT of image retention), I started to get brave, and now I'll play video games for several hours or watch 2-3 letterboxed movies in a row without seeing any sort of retention or burn in. Believe me, I'm sooooo relieved! (That's not to suggest you shouldn't be cautious, at first, though.)CONS- The 3D is decent, but if you're a huge fan of 3D content, get the VT50. The default 60Hz refresh rate does cause a little bit of ghosting (which is mostly unnoticeable unless you're looking for it), and while the 48Hz refresh rate completely eliminates that, it is a little more flickery than I prefer. (It actually looks identical to the same kind of flicker you'd see at a movie theater that still uses film projection, rather than digital, so if you can tolerate that, then you can tolerate this.) The VT50 has an option for a much higher refresh rate that reduces ghosting and also doesn't introduce flickering, so if 3D content is really important to you, that may be your better bet.- The built-in apps are... meh. The only ones that interested me are the Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube apps, so I haven't tried any others, but their performance is inferior to dedicated devices, like the Roku. They're slow, their interfaces are sub-par, and they just don't feel \"solid\". If streaming video is important to you, throw down $60 for a Roku or some other dedicated device. The experience is better, faster, and more comfortable.- Rainbows. While I don't really notice flickering, I do notice some of the \"rainbow effect\" that you get with other display technologies like DLP. When there are large blocks of white around large areas of darkness, if I move my eyes across the screen really fast, I see a yellow & blue rainbow effect. It's barely noticeable (and I've found it's just ignored at this point), but if this is the kind of thing you are particularly sensitive to, you may want to check one of these in person, first. (And if you don't know what I'm talking about, then you've probably never seen it elsewhere before, so don't worry about it. It's only 1% of the population that is sensitive to this sort of thing.)CALIBRATIONI've had the TV for 3 weeks and viewed it for about 300 hours. (I work from home and the TV is on pretty much all day every day.) I'd consider it fully broken in, and the color and levels have settled over the last week. I did NOT use any break-in slides or anything of the sort, just normal viewing material. Since it has settled, I've professionally calibrated it and then adjusted it for attractiveness and optimal viewing in multiple scenarios (daytime, nighttime, etc). (In case you're wondering, a perfectly calibrated TV is amazing, but also a little... flat. I adjusted to make it \"pop\" a little more, while still looking completely natural; i.e. no blown out colors or brights/darks.) Your results may vary, but here are my settings:Contrast: 76Brightness: 56Color: 45Tint: 1Sharpness: 71 (except when watching perfectly clear video, like BluRays, at which point it's set to 50)Color Temp: Warm2CATS: OffVideo NR: Auto (again, except when watching perfectly clear video)Under Pro Settings:Color space: NormalW/B high R: 8W/B high G: 2W/B high B: 1W/B low R: 2W/B low G: -3W/B low B: 2Black extension: 15Gamma: 2.0Panel Brightness: MidContour Emphasis: OnAGC: 0Under Advanced Picture:Mosquito NR: OffMotion Smoother: OffBlack Level: LightIt should be noted that several people have posted other settings that result in a \"technically\" perfect and calibrated image, but for regular viewing, you should adjust to your preferences. (Which the above is, to my preferences.) Try the settings out after you've run the TV for a couple hundred hours and see what you think of it.All in all, I strongly recommend this TV. It is without question the best quality picture I've ever seen on a television, and I'm so pleased I purchased it!

It does work fine with HDMI 1.3 cables.-- IR is the  biggest complaint.Have had the TV for about 3 weeks and Image Retention (IR) is too quick to happen.  Note that not only does Panasonic not provide any break-in guidelines, but the (pathetically inadequate) user manual states it should not be a problem. It does not even strongly advise using the anti-image-retention pixel orbiter,  however I enabled it to be cautious.We inadvertently  left the TV on the Nat Geo Wild channel for a few hours one day.  This channel, like most cable channels,  displays its own logo superimposed onto the broadcast material.  However the logo goes off during commercials, which occurs for 1 - 2 minutes  every 10 - 12  minutes, giving the display a break. So even though leaving on this one channel for a few hours was unintentional,  I would still  consider this  usage well within bounds for normal television viewing.Immediately we discovered the station logo is now emblazoned in the lower right screen.  I enacted the anti-image-retention scroll bar function which is supposed to \"wipe\" IR.  This function displays a scrolling alternating pattern of large  white and black blocks moving across the screen.  Not only has this done nothing to help eradicate the station logo ghost image (despite running so far for 8 times which was a pain since it turns itself off after 15 minutes), but it made me realize that the fuzziness I thought I noticed mid-screen was really a faint IR of Panasonic's own Smart Viera banner. (You can see IR images well when the white block scrolls over them)  I can only think this was on the panel when it arrived as new, since the banner itself displays for only a second or 2 when the panel is  first turned on.I have sent Panasonic an email telling them the panel quality is not fit for the advertised purpose of normal TV viewing and would like it replaced, will see what response comes back.Also I would note that per other reviewers, the set does have an audible (but tolerable) buzzing noise some of the time.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture....

I noticed that we had bars forming on the right and left side of the TV that were lighter than the rest of the screen and this lined up perfectly with the side bars that are left black when watching content that is not full screen.We rarely watch anything in that format except my kids were occasionally watching some cartoons on Youtube which were in this format and since it is through the built in Youtube app, you cannot change the viewing ratio. My kids had watched at most a total of 10 hours (over the course of a little over a month) of this before noticing this issue.Called Panasonic and explained the issue. They said that this shouldn't happen and sent out a tech to look at it. Tech spent a total of 1 minute looking at it before telling me that Panasonic does not cover any burn / image retention and that its not their problem. He even showed me in the owners manual it mentions this but it not 100% clear in my opinion since it only mentions \"still images\" (ie: pictures). I am in the process of arguing with Panasonic on this as it was their built-in app which you cannot change the viewing ratio on that seemed to have caused this but so far they are saying they will not cover it. I even called Amazon and complained but they won't help either as its past the 30 day return window.I am extremely unhappy that I bought a TV that I am essentially limited on what I can watch on it otherwise it may burn the image into the screen with extremely limited use. I have ran the screen wipe utility for hours on it at this point and it has not helped one bit.

Well, within a few hours of turning on my TC-P50GT50, I detected a buzzing noise that was more noticeable than my other Panasonic plasma (TC-46PGT24).  I also noticed the buzzing noise got louder the brighter the screen got.  I immediately called Panasonic's customer service and they promptly scheduled a repair technician to come out and inspect the television without any hassles whatsoever.

I have a moderately bright room during the daytime, and play a lot of video games, so bright room performance, input lag, and IR resistance were important to me.I didn't really care about 3d or SmartTV features, simply wanted the best picture quality I could afford. Compared to LED's with similar features, I feel this TV was an excellent bargain.When I got it set up in my living room, I was astonished. The color depth and clarity when watching Blu-rays honestly amazed me. Quite simply, it looked better than any other TV I had ever seen. Sports are fantastic - no motion blur like many LED's that you see. I've played a ton of video games on it - not a hint of IR or Burn In. It even looks great in a bright room (the THX bright room setting helps a lot here). In a dark room, you can turn on a custom setting (check for settings available everywhere) and get lost in a great movie or game.The TV itself looks fantastic, very classy, and fits in with my home well.I don't use the TV speakers as I have an seperate AVR for sound, so I can't comment on the SQ, but i'm sure it's pretty bad as ALL TV speakers are now. The SmartTV features work well, although I don't use them very often. I had no trouble connecting it to my WiFi network. I do appreciate getting firmware updates over the network.I'm not sure I have too much in the way of cons. The HDMI inputs could be in a better location as they are almost to the edge of the TV and you have to either bend your HDMI cables or purchase 90 deg. elbow attachments to keep the cables from showing from behind the TV.

I have had the 65\" model now for over a month and wanted to wait until posting my thoughts. I am more than pleased with this set. We used to have a 50\" LED TV in the same area this one is in. We wanted a larger set and after doing my homework, decided the Panasonic was the one to get even though it was a more expensive model than most out there. After setting it up and increasing contrast, brightness and sharp settings from day one to our liking, (against the advice of some who said it might have IR - Image Retention) we have really been impressed with the television. It blew away the old TV.  Not the slightest bit of problems with IR even though we didn't give it any kind of special treatment to baby it. I was careful not to let the set sit overnight paused, but other than that, we now have well over 100 hours on the unit and have zero issues.The TV is gorgeous with blacks as dark as night and brilliant whites. Zero blur no matter how fast the action is on the screen. Today, we set up a 3D Blu-ray player and watched our first 3D movie and that was a great experience as well. Felt as if we were immersed in the movie. 3D is not a high priority for us, but because we wanted the 65\" panel, it was an extra and will enjoy occasional use of the 3D feature.Bottom line is I am even more happy with this television than even expected.

First, both are about as good as you can get for a plasma for well under $1,5000.00. In a lot of ways, it's pretty close but the Panasonic is definetly slightly better picture wise. On brightly lit scenes it's close, but the Panasonic seems slighty more accurate, a little more definition on it. On dark scenes there's a bit more definition in favor of the Panasonic, you can make out more in a scene. When watching the avengers, it was quite a bit more clear on a lot of the darker scenes. What makes that last statement seem a little odd is that the Panasonic actually has darker blacks to it. When you get those black bars on the top and bottom of the tv when they cut the picture, the Panasonics black bars were so black, it almost matched the gloss black frame on it! That's another thing, the frame on the Panasonic looks a lot nicer with a better stand. The Samsung looks like one of my picture frames around it, not as nice, and the stand, although seems solid, I didn't care for, but that's just my taste, some might like it though. On the sound if that matters to you, the samsung I could probably live with, somewhat decent. The Panasonic is bad, you'll want a soundbar or home theater for it. I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was.  I  have a 5 yr old Panasonic 42\" plasma that is decent, never even thought about a soundbar when I bought it. I can't comment about 3D on either of these as I haven't watched anything with 3D. The only thing I do know is that at least the Samsung comes with 3D glasses as does the step down Samsung 7000 series. The Panasonic you'll have to buy them and there not real cheap. Speaking about the Samsung I think if your leaning more that way, I'd forego the 8000 series and save a couple of hundred and get the 7000 instead. You get the exact same picture and all the added extras except for the face and voice recognition, unless you realy feel you have to have it. I personaly like the Panasonic a little better and that's what I went with in spite of the sound problem, I just liked the picture better. One more thing to mention, some years back, the Pioneer kuro tv's were considered the best back in the day.  Unless you find one on ebay, the Panasonic and Samsung are about the best out there now except the Panasonic uses the pioneers front panels on them and Samsung uses Panasonics old panels on theirs. I hope some of this might help anyone looking at either of these tv's, there both really good.

I am something of a videophile, and only after eighteen days of ownership, I am happier with the way this one processes video with very little jaggies, artifacts, or pixelation issues, and it does a good job of eliminating motion blur at the default medium setting.

The UT50, ST50 and GT50.  The UT50 had a very nice picture but the reflections bouncing off it were ridiculous! I mean it picked up everything including my arm with nothing more than a dim table light on.  The UT50 would be great in a strictly dark environment.  Brought it back and exchanged for an ST50.Once again, great picture and the louvre filter did a great job at absorbing light but certain window reflections during the day could not be totally eliminated (I like leaving my windows open).  BUT once watching a program, the fluctuation of color in scene changes and the way the screen absorbs the light, I barely noticed them unless the scene was really dark.  However, towards the evening or with the blind closed window  reflections totally disappear and the screen turns into silk! The drawback with the ST50 though? BUZZING! Oh man, it drove me nuts!  The frequency of the buzz would change as the scenes changed from lighter to darker and everything in between at a conservative volume level.  I could have drowned it out with more volume but I don't watch TV at a loud level at night.  It had to go back with that complaint.So finally brought a 50\" GT50 home - Check out the pic (with ZZ in it). Blacks are blacks on the UT50/ ST50 but on the GT50 it's BLACK with DETAIL! (with the same great light absorption louvre).  Although I only used a Canon point and shoot to take the picture, you should be able to see creases in the clothes and fabric in shadows, etc., Fantastic!  Do shades of gradation make a big difference?  Absolutely! You can see finer details on skin, faces, clothes, etc., period.I also turned down the volume and checked for buzzing and there is definitely a plasma buzz associated with it but it sounded more like the normal operation of the TV itself, not the obnoxious sound I heard coming from the ST. After playing with some of the settings, I discovered that when you turn C.A.T.S. off that that makes the buzz a bit stronger.  Turning it on reduces the buzz but at the expense of screen brightness which dulls the picture quality too much.  Regular volume kills the sound from 6-8 feet away in all but the quietest of scenes but then like I said it just sounds like normal operation sound.  The slight increase in buzz only occurs when scenes go bright.  Using anything above normal listening level and it's gone. Completely acceptable for me.I also like the fact that the stand swivels on the base on the 50\" models.  I use the swivel frequently and it's very solid with fluid motion.  Apps load fast and Netflix is great, not to mention DLNA.  I manually entered my hidden WiFi SSID and it connected easily to the 5 Ghz mode.  My laptop popped up instantly, I enabled it in homegoup/ networking and my tunes were played through my receiver via ARC (HDMI 2), movie clips and pics too.The Web browser is not too bad. A wireless keyboard would be better than plunking in the text manually but once on a webpage if you press and hold the directional arrows on the remote, the cursor will move around like a mouse on the screen.  I can't see myself using it that much but it would be good enough in a pinch.  I'd say the speed of page loading has the performance of a laptop with a 5400rpm drive and 2GB of Ram or better.  CNN news & videos played within seconds in full screen mode and sounded great!  No lag moving between apps.So for $335 more, extra features include:- THX Mode for 2D/ 3D- 2D/3D Conversion w/ Face Detection- 24,576 shades of Gradation instead of 12,288- Multitasking- Dual Core Processor for Viera Smart Engine Pro- Pure Image Creation- 4 HDMI/ 3 USB instead of 3/2- Bluetooth for Keyboard & Audio Devices- VGA PC input- thin metal frame instead of floating Crystal/ AcrylicI originally made up my mind to purchase an HDTV at no more than the ST50 price level but as it happened the GT50 is staying put...  the plastic has been pulled off the bezel.  I say 4.75 Stars because if they could make this TV dead silent in operation mode it would be pretty much perfect.  For now volume does the trick.  My TV is on an oak desk about a foot away from bare drywall so YMMV.I probably would've kept the ST50 without the buzz that I encountered and maybe others have one where it's not noticeable but on mine it was. But now that I've used the GT50, I prefer it's HD picture quality over the ST.On a side note, I noticed a gentleman complaining in the reviews that he doesn't have access to his Zoom controls and that he darn well wanted them for the amount of money he paid, lol.  If you go into Custom Picture Mode and choose Zoom as the Aspect setting in Screen format, then your Zoom control becomes accessible instead of being greyed out.So, this has been asked before and I had the same question myself, ST50 or GT50? The ST50 without a buzz and all the apps -> you'll be very happy for the price. The GT50 with normal operating buzz, improved HD picture quality in details/ shadows, faster processor with quick web browser and apps -> you'll be happiER if you don't mind parting with an extra 3 hundge and change! I didn't want to but I did - an extra 2 year warranty was included which offset the higher price.  It just all boils down to your willingness to cough up the extra DoE Rei Mee, LOL!p.s. Just added another pic streaming from NetFlix in X-High HD mode.  Check out the Breaking Bad pic with Bryan Cranston... Amazing pictre quality!

I'm not sure if I have a defective tv or if plasma tvs don't fit my lifestyle.  I really enjoy watching sports.  One thing that drew me to this particular television was it's outstanding reviews for color and picture.  I was aware that image retention (IR) could be an issue with plasma tvs so I did some more research.  From what I read, burn in was labeled a thing of the past and IR, while annoying, could be fixed by running a program.My experiences with this particular television is IR is more of a annoyance.  I cannot watch a football game without having the logo of the network remain persistent.  Right now ESPN and Fox are always visible.  When I say always visible, I mean when the backgrounds are lighter colors.  I didn't notice anything of the sort for the first 6 months of owning the television.  Earlier this summer I noticed the ESPN logo.  I tried running different programs and the built in screen wiping program, but to no avail.  A few weeks later, while still running these programs hoping to get rid of the espn, the fox logo appeared.If you are someone who likes to watch television on networks with logos then I cannot recommend this tv.  My guess is if you use if for nothing but watching movies that are full screen and limit watching anything with a static image like any sports, you probably will not experience problems.The tv actually looks amazing and the features work great.  My only complaint is this television does not match up will with my tv viewing interests.  Because I like to watch sports, I now have to live with image retention/burn in.Update:  I have spent the last two weeks dealing with Panasonic.  They refuse to do anything to help with this issue.  Their only suggestions is to run their scrolling wipe bar or display all white or all black on the tv.  They cannot say how long it will take to correct or if it will prevent it from happening again.Just don't buy a Panasonic plasma tv from Panasonic.  They have a real problem with this.

Audio.The only audio output is Toslink (fiber). And with that there is no 7.1 pass-through. There is no HDMI outputs that can take a HDMI input and pass-through to the receiver. Unless you have a top-of-the-line receiver that can pass-through all of the digital info (like 3D, and such) then you wont get it to the TV.

This is my second plasma by panasonic and I love it. I use CNET reviews to buy televisions and the 2009 50\" i own was number one that year. For the features CNET rated this tv very well. I use the tv for my XBOX and watching 3D and blu-ray movies.First: The whole argument of what technology is better is up to you and your home. Plasmas are heavier and run hotter. This tv does not make a humming noise or white noise like some have said. If you have a brightly lit room and do not darken then do not get this tv. My opinion is that plasmas really have better blacks then lcd and led. You can brighten any tv but making it truly darker is more difficult.Gameplay: Is amazing and the darker blacks really help when i play games and FPS where people are coming out of the shadows. Ghosting is a thing of the past.3D: I have now only watched Life of Pi and the Avengers. I own the glasses that are sold by panasonic and recommended. I agree that $60 is a lot and the tv should come with at least two. Life of Pi was not shot well in my opinion and therefore was lack luster in the 3D. The Avengers was amazing!!! I saw it opening night in the theatre and on my tv it was amazing. Let me repeat amazing!!! I am a movie snob and only watch Imax 3D on most action movies. DO NOT i repeat DO NOT go by the manual recommendation on how far you should sit. Everyone is different in eyesight and field of vision. I started my couch very close then moved back until the tv met the edges of the glasses, NOT the recommended 10' as in the manual.

WE had to replace it due to a power supply problem.  I have researched plasma TVs and read thousands of reviews on them.  In the end we decided on the Panasonic Viera because of the technology in the TV and the price.One of the biggest complaints I heard from people was a burn in issue with the Panasonic's.  Let me say that we never have had any burn in issues with a plasma TV, including the Viera.  Our TV is on from 5-8 hours each day and we watch a variety of shows in 16:9 and 4:3 and we probably watch 3-5 channels.  All of this to say that we have never had a logo burn in or anything.  We did follow the directions for the first 100 hours to try and keep different channels on each hour to allow the burn in process to occur.  We even use the TV for video games.  My take you have to be using the TV, on the same channel, for hours each day, weeks on end to get burn in.As for the other features, we use amazon streaming over wireless and have no buffering issues due to slow processing etc.We bought 2 pairs of the 3D eyeglasses and have been pleased with the 3D viewing experience.  The picture is amazing and the black levels are great.If I had to give a negative about the TV it would be the sound quality, it is just like any other TV, you really need a sound bar to achieve rich levels of sound.My Opinion, you can't beat a plasma TV for the rich color and high definition", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R3UHR2KK471GDT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best TV I've owned.

Everything looks great (online content, broadcast TV, Satellite TV, etc.). The 3d quality is decent. I bought the Samsung active shutter glasses because they are a lot cheaper than Panasonic's, and since we do not watch 3d content much, it is not a concern for us.

I had never considered a Plasma as I thought they were old news. After reading a significant amount of info, my biggest concern was the brightness. We have a large window and slider in the living/dining area and I was concerned about the brightness. The other challenge was the mfr, I'm biased towards Samsung but everywhere I looked including Consumer Reports, the Panasonic was higher rated, more reliable and less likely to have the buzzing that people complain about on the Samsung Plasmas.The brightness is not a problem, it's plenty bright for our room. The picture is remarkable, we stepped up from a 2009 model year Samsung 52 inch LCD. It may just be me, but I always felt like I saw blurring with fast moves on the LCD and I don't see that with the Plasma. The 3D works good, we got the Samsung glasses because they were only $20/ea and they had no problems working with the Panasonic although the Panasonics may work better as they look like they'd block out anything from the side.I went with the GT as it has has almost the same screen as the VT and from what I read the ST didn't have as good of blacks.

Totally worth the extra money over the ST model. I can easily switch between picture modes as the ambient conditions in my room change.I've not watched any 3D content yet, but I've tried out the 2D to 3D conversion, and it's quite good. You sacrifice some brightness, but that's expected. On a side note, I bought one pair of Panasonic's glasses and one pair of Samsung glasses. They're fairly similar (the Panasonic being a little sturdier), so would opt for the less expensive Samsung model.I've got a high-end audio system so don't use the audio on the TV itself.At night when it's completely dark, the picture on this TV simply takes your breath away. The blacks are so deep and the amount of detail is unlike anything I've ever seen.If you want the best picture possible in a home TV, consider plasma...it blows LED out of the water, and Panasonic is the undisputed champ of fabulous plasma picture quality.Edited 12/18/12I had to edit this review to add the following: Panasonic customer service is the best in the business.Like others have noted, there can be a buzzing with this TV. Well, mine had it and I called Customer Service about it. They sent a technician (who had to drive two hours to get to my house), and he replaced screws Panasonic thought might be causing the problem. It did not help. The tech (an independent engineer, i.e., not a Panasonic employee) said he would call the engineers at Panasonic about it. The next day he called back and said the Panasonic engineers were sending him two new boards and he would be coming back to replace them.He just left. The buzz is not completely gone, but is no longer noticeable. It seems that due to EPA rules on energy use components on the each of these boards are required to cycle very quickly and it can cause certain other components to sing. That's what creates the buzz. Panasonic pre-tested the boards they sent to ensure they would not.I'm not an engineer, so am not explaining this well, but the end result is fantastic.Two trips (four hours round trip each time), two overnight shipments from Panasonic to the tech/engineer, two new boards for the plasma. In all, I'd say Panasonic just paid to have me keep the TV. I know of no other electronics company that stands behind their products this well.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible", "Author": "Frozen North", "ReviewID": "R1Q8VWEWEG81S7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this based on CNET reviews and other user reviews.

The blacks are incredibly deep, and the color absolutely pops.  The one thing of this plasma in particular, it really performs well in a bright lit room, which is a weakness to most plasma screens.I will agree based on reviews with the one negative review that states the issue with screen burn in.

I looked at the VT50locally and read everything online about it.  Sure the touchpad remote is \"neat\" but will I ever be able to tell the difference betweenTHX Pro and Ultra?  I doubt it.  96 hz 24p playback might be the only \"goodie\" I'm missing  out on. However even that feature might bea little more fluff than reality as more and more new movies are \"filmed\" in HD anyway.The base/stand is nicely weighted and allows a little bit of swivel to one side or the other. The best part is that it holds the setat a near perfect 90* angle, so many cheaper sets out there are tilted fore or aft whilst on the stand. The anti-glare screen is ofvery little consequence to me as I have this set in my newly finished basement theater/family room.  The only lighting is artificialand can be dimmed just like the movies.The sets built in sound is good by any modern standard of a narrow depth tv.  Sure an older 250lbs 60\" CRT Projection set had somenice 5.25\" or even larger speakers built in and could produce some serious volume.  What comes out of this set is perfectly adequatefor your average sitcom or news channel.  I use a Polk surround setup w/subwoofer for movies and music.Panasonic's remote controls have come a long way in 10 years, they used to have 150 buttons all about grain of rice size.  Nowthey're laid out a little intuitively and the color coding is nice as well.My only regret is of course not getting a bigger set but alas I'm very happy with my 50\" set.

Picture and sound are great (it's not wall-mounted; originally I had used just the TV sound altho I now have the sound routed thru a Samsung Soundbar), streaming thru Amazon Prime Video works great, and 3D is stunning.  My only complaint is that this 60\" does NOT swivel on its base (and a minor niggle: the base is partly silver-colored; would prefer solid black).Delivery:  So-so - It's great that it's free but you get what you pay for.  We were supposed to have 2 men but got only 1.  And hook-up is up to you; they just check whether it appears in good shape and turns on.This is the first time I'd ever ordered a big item from Amazon.  Was a little nervous, but their process initially made me feel better - I got a message asking me to select a time frame for this to be delivered, and I chose the \"9A-Noon\" option for the day AFTER it would've been first available.  So I arranged to work from home that day.  But 9-Noon came & went, nothing.  Long story short, finally arrived at 12:47 and there was just one old fellow (I'm guessing 65) to move the merchandise.  When I answered the door, he peered down at me (i'm just 5 foot tall, petite female) and said, \"Are you the only one here?\"  At that point, I realized it would be up to him & me to unload & move that big honkin 60\" TV into our house, so I said, \"I'm stronger than I look.\"  Needless to say, if we'd had to move this 100-lb TV anywhere upstairs or downstairs, it would've been nearly impossible.  When I later looked at the paperwork he'd left, it had clearly indicated that \"TWO MEN\" were needed for delivery.  Maybe his young-pup partner had a rough night before and called in sick, but clearly Pilot isn't a great delivery partner for Amazon.TV itself:  WOW!!!!!!  I'm a little peeved that a full Owner Manual isn't included (you have to go online, or use the Help option from the remote), but realize that's becoming more & more common, so haven't taken off a star for it.Beautiful picture, good sound.  The \"2D-to-3D\" conversion works amazingly well, although we'll probably never use it in real life.Biggest niggle is not enough non-HDMI inputs.

I understand that high-end LED screens can render pictures very well, the iMac 27inch screen being one example. However, those 60inch LED TVs in the 2000$ price range are not of that high quality. They are more like those low-end Samsung LED monitors than the iMac.  So when I was in the process of upgrading to a bigger TV (60 inch), I decided to give the good old Plasma a try, and I couldn't be happier.  The picture on this TV (especially the two THX certified modes) is very much like what you would expect in a movie theater. The colors are mostly accurate, and dark details are rendered very well. I am a movie fan and to my taste this TV is bright enough.The design is also slim and attractive, looking as good as, if not better than, most LEDs. It consumes more power than LED, but for the picture quality I think it is more than worth it.The apps are better than my LG and adequate. I mostly only use Netflix and Amazon Video anyways. I don't use 3D. The only reason I bought a 3D TV is because you can't find a decent 2D TV nowadays in the market with this size.The only thing I regret a bit is that I should get the 65inch instead of the 60inch. You never complain that your TV is too big and should always buy the largest screen possible within your budget.

The two delivery guys were in a huge rush, made a mess, did not do any of the things they were supposed to and I had to argue and instruct them throughout the process. They did the bare minimum, if that. There was a return of the ST as well and they bounced that ST around like I can't explain. When I told them they should go easy on it, they stopped, looked at me with complete confusion and said \"but you're returning it, no? What's the difference?\" Nice to see they really put their heart into their work. I'm sure my GT was handled with kid gloves (pfft). Caveat emptor if you ever have Pilot delivering anything.

The glass extends all the way to the metal edges, rather than the cheaper plastic molding on the ST; nice touch but certainly not a major factor.

I intend to wall-mount this baby after I'm convinced that the current location is where I want it to stay. At around 100 lbs, I'll need to get some help from a neighbor to install it.PICTURE QUALITY:Before settling on this TV, I compared picture quality in a side-by-side evaluation of plasma, LED rear-lit LCD, and LED edge-lit LCD in the \"high end\" section of the local \"BB\" store. The sales person was quite helpful in adjusting the TV settings and using a video source that helped in the evaluation. I was going back and forth between LED back-lit LCD and plasma, but decided on plasma for the consistent color density from a wide viewing angle (you may lose some intensity, but you wont' get washed-out colors as with the LCD TVs).Check the other reviews for tweaking the settings, as I haven't messed with them yet. The default settings for the various modes seem great - I tend to use the THX Cinema Mode for HD movies from my satellite receiver, and the Standard Mode for news, etc. Didn't try the 3D, as I don't have any 3D programming material (nor 3D glasses -- they're not included with the TV), and it wasn't why I bought the TV anyway. I'm sure I'll tweak the TV eventually, as there are LOTS of things you can adjust, but you probably need a calibrated input to optimize the TV. I DID notice that, even with the contrast and brightness turned down to \"0\", the picture was still quite visible.Like most plasmas, viewing this TV in a room where light sources won't cause glare can be an issue, as the screen is glossy. That said, we don't seem to have much of an issue with daytime viewing with the vertical blinds closing off the majority of light from our patio door.AUDIO QUALITY: I'm sure you can get more robust audio from a home theater system, but my audio's pretty dated. The audio from the TV is pretty clean with reasonable base response (there's a setting to reduce base if the unit is less than a foot from the wall) so I'm gonna wait before spending some cash on externals (probably will get a Blu-Ray player before then).SOFTWARE UPDATES: Pretty easy to configure a WiFi connection with my Verizon JetPack \"Mi-Fi\" card. There was an update available, so I started to download it. Unfortunately, my Verizon internet connection (via Mi-Fi) isn't robust, and the TV does NOT save partial downloads. I lost connection about 80% of the way through, and have yet to attempt a reconnect -- maybe late at night when there is less network demand (can't wait for Verizon to launch LTE in my area, but guess I'll have to).SHIPMENT: (I moved this to the end of the review in case you want to skip it..)Waited with great anticipation for this highly-rated TV to arrive at my home. It replaces an old Toshiba rear-projection TV that I had repaired once (~$400 to repair a few years back), and said I'd replace when it needed a second repair. Delivery was a minor disappointment -- the local delivery service was scheduled to deliver the TV between 2pm and 6pm, but didn't show up until 7:30pm (and they still had 3 deliveries after mine -- in their defense, these guys are overworked). That said, I still got the TV two days earlier than the Amazon estimate. They brought the TV in, assembled the stand, put batteries in the remote, and fired up the TV. I kept the box in case a return was needed (although I'm not sure if I could repackage it).", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "burn-in", "Author": "seagoat8888 \"seagoat\"", "ReviewID": "R30ELS7UNQ9RD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Permanent burn-in of the \"ID\" channel logo after watching for one afternoon.

Watch a blue-ray movie and it's stunning.  The black is so dark that it can difficult to tell the difference between the screen and the edge of the TV.- Game Play: The TV has special game play modes which helps when there is a lot of movement on the screen.- 3D: I have not tried this mode.- TV Finish: the fit and finish of the TV is very nice.Cons:- There is a bit of a learning curve on how to properly navigate the setup menus.  This isn't a real problem as you rarely will have to go into the menus anyway.- Screen Glare: The screen creates a lot of glare - fortunately my TV is in a basement with very little natural light.  If there is any light source that is directly in line with the TV it will clearly show on the screen.  This TV is best for dark, 'media' room applications.Observations:- Weight: this TV is heavy - even to install the attached base you will need two people.- Wall Mounting: be sure to purchase a wall mount that can handle a weight beyond the stated weight of this TV and a mount that allows the TV to be pulled away from the wall.  You do not want to be trying to manage cables in a small gap with such a heavy TV.- Buzzing: I had seen on other reviews that this TV will buzz when displaying a large amount of light or white color - this is true.  The only time I have ever noticed this is when I have all sound muted.  In other words, you would never notice this with any normal sound coming out of the TV or your audio system.- Sound: This is probably a given, but if you're going to buy a TV like this do not rely on the sound from the TV.  Purchase an audio system that is of the same caliber as this TV- Usage: I use the TV almost exclusively for watching blue-ray movies.  Any other format and I feel like I'm wasting my time - not that it doesn't look good, but watching a standard cable signal isn't much different that watching on any other TV.- Prepping the screen: I have read where people will run a presentation on the TV for several hours that will 'burn in' or prep the plasma display.  I did not do this and therefore am unaware of any difference this might have made.  As far as I'm concerned the picture was great right out of the box.

The 3D is really fun, and I actually like it a lot more than I thought I would.  I'm still in the break-in period (I understand you don't have to do this, but I play a lot of video games and want to do everything I can to prevent burn in), but the picture quality does look great.  I have an older Panasonic plasma, and the picture on this TV is much better than the old one.A word of warning to any of you that are looking to buy this and are taking the TV Low Price Guarantee as a factor in your decision making process.  From reading the Details section, it makes it sound simple; if you see the TV priced lower on Amazon (or many other retailers) just let them know and they will refund you the difference.  I'll take the blame on this one and admit that I don't usually read the terms and conditions of just about anything.  I expect to get the important points on any summary of an offer/guidelines, etc.  I'll help you all out if you are like me.  You can only request this refund ONCE.Now, I don't think that is unreasonable at all, the low price guarantee is great, but just be cautious when you submit it.  I didn't know that was the case and submitted a refund request when I saw the price dip $50.  Had I known that I could only request the refund once I would have waited a little further in my guarantee period and risk that I could be out $50.  Now, the TV is $200 less than I paid.  I don't want you to make the same mistake that I did.  Also, the 14 days kicks in after the TV ships, which could be much different than your delivery date if you are like me and have a job where you can't easily get time off.So, in summary, the TV is great, but watch out for the TV Low Price Guarantee.  I called Amazon to complain and suggested that they put a warning when you request the refund that you only get ONE request and was stonewalled.  The guy told me that he tells people that when you call to request the refund, but I never considered using the phone to deal with Amazon, it was hard enough finding the number when I called looking for help with this issue.UPDATEAfter telling Amazon that I wasn't pleased with how my complaint was handled, on my second call they were able to help me out.

I feel image retention is no longer an issue with plasma TVs unless they are really abused.  As far as burn in of phosphors is concerned, I relied on normal everyday viewing to do that. I never used those color slides that some talk about.  I never felt the need for professional picture calibration.  Picture is superb, any additional picture improvement with calibration likely to be subtle and of no consequence in real world viewing pleasure.  The TV is in a man cave environment for event viewing.  Light is well controlled.  For everyday TV watching, LED HDTVs  are superior especially if the room lighting cannot be well controlled.

I had hooked up an external surround sound system. The problem was that Windows 7 wouldn't recognize it. It would only see a 2 channel system. I thought it was a Windows issue and went through a very lengthy process to try and resolve it including installing new drivers, installing a different video card with HDMI support, switching the computer motherboard and even upgrading the Samsung sound system to a Yamaha YSP-2200 sound bar. Nothing worked.As a last resort I emailed Panasonic thinking that it might be a firmware issue on the TV. To their credit, I got a quick response.  They said;\"When audio from other equipment connected to this unit via HDMI is output using ?Digital Audio Out? of this unit, the system switches to 2CH audio.\"The English wasn't good and I wasn't sure if they were asking for clarification or were saying that the TV works that way by design so I asked for clarification.  They responded;\"As mentioned in our previous response, this is how the TV will operate. We apologize for any inconvenience.\"So, this is the way the TV is designed.  If connect the TV to an external device via optical out, it forces 2 channel sound.Panasonic didn't clarify why it behaves this way.  If the TV can't determine what type of sound system is connected to the optical out, then it would make sense.  I'm pretty sure that's not the case.  I've connected surround sound devices to my computer's optical out and it detected the speaker configuration.  The TV should just relay that information through.  If it can't, detect the speakers then there should be an option to tell it what speakers are hooked up.Since these flat screen TV's have such bad speakers it's very common to hook up a set of external surround sound speakers.  The Panasonic is crippled as a surround sound system. At least if you want to use the TV as a switching device. This is making me sorry that I purchased an Panasonic TV. If you're shopping for one, I'd recommend looking at something else.

You can't hear it with the sound on, but it's not encouraging. It's probably a transformer, and it's nothing you haven't heard before, but probably not something you want to hear form an expensive television.The savings came from the the body construction and the electronic components other than the panel.I gave the six year old 720p to a friend, and I'm pretty confident that one will still be going strong six years from now.

I don't know if it's a bug, or if the cable signal doesn't come with cc data.- sometimes a band extends across the screen if the image contains a bright horizontal line.

Once calibrated the darks look great and the colors really pop. The TV has some shortcomings (listed below), but the only thing I really care about is the picture quality and, IMO, it's second to none.The Viera internet software on it is great. I have a 2 year old Panasonic Blu-Ray player that has the same interface but runs much slower. Now I watch Netflix & Amazon Prime through the TV and just use the Blu-Ray for movies on disc. Viera has many apps, including a Vudu app in case you want to rent 3D movies. That's the only place I've found them available for rent. Regarding the 3D, it looks good but I'm not a big fan of 3D. I bought glasses and watched a few, but I'll probably stick to 2D in the future unless I can get my local sports in 3D, then it might be worth it.I'm not sure how many people care about this, but the internal tuner works very well. In the same location, and with the same antenna, I'm able to pull in more channels than I could with my 2007 Panasonic. I've cut the cable cord, so getting more channels in the same location was a nice bonus. That being said, I can't compare this to any other models currently on the market.Shortcoming #1: The sound quality is at best \"weak\". I used it for a few minutes and then decided I'd always use the TV with my stereo. While my last Panasonic had much better sound, it was also two inches thicker and heavier. Given how thin the TV is I'll deal with the weak sound. I would have preferred no speakers at all to cut down on weight and maybe make it even thinner.Shortcoming #2: The TV's listed thickness doesn't include the power cord. The cord sticks about an inch out the back with the default clip. Remove the clip and it's a little over a half inch. I hung this on the wall with a half inch thick mounting bracket and, once the clip was removed, it rests flat enough against the wall where it's not a problem.

I was reluctant to buy a plasma (I was under the impression that they were generally inferior in some important ways), but after doing some research (you'll see that C-NET and AVSFORUMS all rate the Viera ST50/GT50/VT50 line very, very highly in terms of overall performance and picture quality), I took the plunge.

If you don't have time/patience to calibrate, the THX-certified presets are absolutely great. The 3D is fine (for 3D movies), but I find the 2D->3D conversion a little jarring.My only gripe is that this TV does not support xvid/divx (AVI/WMV) files.

I'm very happy with it so far. I use it primarily for Xbox 360, blueray movies, Netflix, and sports. My parents bought a 50\" Viera 720p plasma a couple of years. The picture quality on that set was great which is one of the reasons I decided to go with a Panasonic Viera Plasma. One thing that bothered me when shopping for TVs was that many of the sets below 1K didn't have more than 2 HDMI connections. This is another reason I went with this set. The sound on the speakers are decent. I'm strongly considering purchasing some sort of surround system. The picture quality is outstanding so far. This is probably one of the best pictures I've ever seen on a TV. I'm not crazy about the stand that comes with the TV. It's got a silver finish at the front that fades into black/grey near the back of the stand.The only problem I've had so far is that Netflix wasn't functioning properly when I took the TV out of the box.

First of all, I was very worried about the delivery service provided by Pilot Freight after reading all the terrible reviews about them. Fortunately in my case the poor reviews did not apply. Pilot arrived on time as scheduled and called about 45 minutes ahead to confirm. The delivery men were courteous and helpful, and seeing that I had a broken leg went out of their way to make things easier. They even put on plastic booties to make sure they didn't track dirt into the house. I was very satisfied with their service.As to the TV, it has a stunningly beautiful and realistic picture, and the sound seems OK to me in spite of the complaints I read about it. For serious viewing it's part of a home theater system, but as a stand alone it's fine too. I thought the picture on the standard setting was very good out of the box, but when I calibrated the TV according to cnet's recommendations it went from great to better than you can believe. I thought the picture on my Sony XBR1 was good, but this TV outshines it hands down. The initial setup went easily and quickly and the TV connected to my wireless network with no problem - all I had to do was follow the on screen instructions and enter the password - it took about 2 minutes.I did a lot of reading and research before deciding on this, my first plasma TV, and I'm totally happy with the choice so far. The TV itself is very nice looking, is easy to set up and adjust, and has the best picture I've ever seen. I have it in a well lighted room and it is situated so that light from the windows should reflect pretty severely off the screen at my seating position and with the blinds up, but in spite of that the reflections are less obvious than they were with my Sony - when the TV is on they are barely noticeable, no less objectionable. I had read that plasmas don't have as bright a picture as LCD TVs and that they might not be the best choice for bright rooms, but this TV has a great picture in either bright or dark conditions. I haven't used the 3D or the internet apps yet so I can't really comment - I bought the TV mainly for the picture and couldn't be happier with that.This is a very early impression, but if the TV proves to be as reliable as it is beautiful I know I'll enjoy it for years to come.

I was shocked.When I went to look at TV's at a retailer, the plasmas did not look good at all compared to the LED's.  I was surprised and was going to purchase the Sony x850...but it costs so much more and how can every top review site rate the GT/ST picture quality so high, while I am not seeing it?  So, I went against my gut, and believed in the reviewers and went with the GT50.I have never owed a plasma before, so I was pretty nervous about the purchase.  In hindsight, I should not have been. No glare issues, it is better at that than my older tv. Seems a lot of the problems are misinformation.Just to note.  The TV I received, from Amazon, has no buzzing or short term image retention issues, although I am being very cautious for the first 100-300 hours of use.  Changing channels, full screen, not having it to bright etc...Certainly there are things that I can nit pic about the TV:-48hz mode shimmers unless in a real dark room. 60hz looks great though.-I can see some rain-bowing effects.-Plasmas do get a bit warm-Heavier than LED'sIf you want to watch movies with some of the best blacks and picture quality, this TV should be a serious consideration.EDIT 9/17/13:  I have had the TV for a bit now.  IR isn't a problem anymore, I guess it gets better as the tv ages.  I don't notice it, but I am active in changing the screen format during a sports game.  Usually after 30 minutes I change the screen sizing...zoom, wide, regular.  Its annoying but part of the deal for a good image. Sometimes I forget, but not really any issues that I notice.  I also don't actively look for it.  Honestly I have more of a problem with the line bleed.  Its really annoying and a serious tech problem.  All in all still love the image, and when I put in a sci-fi movie it makes it all worth it with the blacks.EDIT 3/6/13:  So I got my first bout of image retention(IR).  I was watching 'Fox Soccer' for a game, took a break at half time(flipped some channels etc...).  I didn't think anything of it.  After the game decided to run some slides on it and for the red slide I saw the 'fox soccer' logo, bright as day.  After seeing that I could see it on some regular viewing.  It has reduced after 4 days of running full screen tv.  I don't think I can see it at all for regular viewing, but I can see it faintly on the red and yellow slides.

I'm of the opinion that the plasma technology is pretty much at its peak (vs LED, which has a long way to mature) and for my home theater basement (with almost zero outside light)plasma was going to be ideal anyway.  Now in a bright room, I would have struggled but when I did side by side comparisons of LED and plasma at the store, I felt that plasma had much more realistic color reproduction that the LED. Don't get me wrong, the LEDs are super bright and have some very intense colors but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching something overly reproduced(was it pixelation?, color saturation? not really sure)The picture is amazing but most certainly at its best when showing blu-ray. I tried the Avengers for the vivid colors, Dark Knight Rises for the blacks, etc. - all my blu-rays looked incredibly crisp, even before the 100 hr break in period.I debated for a while over whether to go with the GT vs the higher end VT or lower ST - but in the end I felt that the combination of features on the GT hit the sweet spot. The main differences between the GT and the VT seem to be mostly in the \"pc element\" of the TV - that is the processor and the memory.  To be honest, these features are not going to be used that much by me anyway since I don't plan on using this to stream movies since I already have an amp, blu-ray, and sony ps3 that can already do this - (you have to love the redundancy in these things - I would stand up and applaud a company that stood up and said, no we aren't going to bother with turning our component into a pc.)

The tv was delivered a day later than promised which was no big deal.  Two men unpacked, set up the tv, and removed the carton.The tv looked perfect with the factory settings.

The 3D is very nice but is subject to the 3D source. If the source is good then the 3D is good.Over all the color is rich and the  picture is very pleasing.There is an \"e HELP\" app on the remote control which is the greatest.  The set comes with a basic setup booklet but the real source of information comes from the eHELP, built into the tv, manual.  Instead of searching around for your misplaced manual, it is right at hand with a simple press on the remote control.There are several \"picture\" settings such as \"cinema\",  \"vivid\" and so on.

Well I returned the LED because of bright spots in the corners on dark screens.  I then got the GT50 (55\").I must say, the picture quality on this TV is better than any TV I've ever seen.  I have Dish Network, and their HD looks amazing.  Blurays via my PS3 look even better.  I read the CNET review and tried their calibration settings but found that the reds were a little too strong.  I personally prefer the out of the box THX Cinema setting.  The image looks perfect.  If anything the contrast can be bumped up a little bit, but the colors seem spot on.3D Blurays are pretty cool.  In comparing the active 3D on this to the passive 3D on the TV I returned, the image is much sharper.  I definitely prefer active 3D, even though in the store, passive looked better.The audio on the TV needs improved. In fact if I was relying on the built in audio I would give the TV a lower rating.  But I believe most people use surround sound or a sound bar with flat TVs, so the audio isn't really an issue, thus the 5 rating.  I have a Boston acoustic sound bar so the sound is not an issue.Some people complain of a buzz on this TV and other plasmas.  I think there are different things people refer to.  Some may have a legitimate buzz.  My TV does not buzz.  If you put your ear up close to the TV (within 1 foot) or behind the TV, you can hear a sound that some may call a buzz.  It sounds like it is the power going to the screen.  It varies in strength and gets a little louder with very bright images on the screen.  This is not an issue for me, at normal viewing distances you don't hear this.  I suppose if you mute the TV and have an all white image on the TV you may hear a faint sound if you concentrate.  Up close you would hear it though.In the Amazon Prime app there seems to be some missing features such as optimizing for PQ or consistent stream.  I don't use apps on the TV.  I use apps on my PS3 if needed.Overall I would say I am quite surprised at the PQ on plasma.  I've had no IR issues and don't think most people will with normal viewing habits.  I think there is a lot of misinformation out there between LCD and Plasmas.  After reading a bunch on avforums and highdefjunkies I realized that Plasma really is the best choice for a great picture.  I'm very pleased with my choice.One other note, during the day I have a fairly bright room with windows on both sides of the room, but no windows in the direct path of the screen.  The screen is plenty bright enough on the THX Cinema setting for my taste, but THX Bright room setting is also nice and helps enhance in a bright room.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not use guest account when attempting to connect to vierra server", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "RLEWCQ19WQE07", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is especially true if you are using a Cisco Linksys router.

I'll touch on the main points. Below are the main benefits that made me buy this tv. I write this after owning the 50GT for a month now:* Compared to LCDs in the same price range this Panasonic will provide a more natural picture. If you prefer super-bright super-punchy pitcher maybe an LCD is better for you. But see my closing comments.* LCDs, known for being brighter, will tend to have a harsher/more saturated picture. Again, see my closing comments.* It used to be that plasmas a)used a lot more power, and b)were a lot heavier. For the most part this is not true anymore. The difference is very close now.* Some people say that a plasma is not good for a bright room. The notion of a bright room is subjective, but I have a fairly bright living room and have no issues with the screen brightness during the day. Either way, watching tv with direct sunlight hitting it is a bad idea, as the picture will be affected (washed out).* Lastly, consider that plasmas offer a great cost-for-performance ratio. Plasmas have been around a lot longer the LCDs, so are a more mature technology. LCDs are still advancing and improving. So LCDs in two years will be a lot different than what you buy today, whereas the same can't be said of plasmas since they've had more time to mature. Are you going to be bothered next year or two when your neighbor shows you the newest LCD with the latest bells and whistles?Keep this in mind, any tv....at any price...any brand...any type....will not look as good as possible if not calibrated and configured. At the very least buy the Disney WOW calibration DVD and spend some time at the avsforum.com forums to learn how to get the best out of your new tv. Forums like the one mentioned contain a LOT of info on using the right settings for your tv.

I always hated it, I never liked the picture.  It always appeared dull/dark.  So I thought maybe an LED was the way to go.  So I bought a bunch of them.. I have tried the Sony 929 (good tv, but the off-angle bothered me), A Vizio 55\" LED (rated highly by Cnet), it was a great tv, but off angle sucked and had quite a reflective screen, and a samsung LED... basically I realized that although yes LEDs have brightness are thinner and lighter, they have one major weakness.. move a little bit off side and the picture washes out.  They also feel much more cheaply made than the Panasonic plasmas.So I kept searching.  After reading all the glowing reviews about Panasonic's 2012 line, I decided to get a 60GT50.  Oh my, what a difference. The PQ is fantastic.  I honestly feel kind of ripped off by Panasonic for the piece of crap VT30.  The Gt50 is what a tv should be. The picture is crystal clear.. the motion fantastic.. its super bright, elegant looking.  I also play a lot of xbox, and the games look better too.  Overall I've been missing out with the Vt30.. this is one of the best TVs I have ever seen.. I highly recommend it!  I'm using CNETs recommended settings but I increased the contrast a tad.

I'm using THX Cinema with adjustments noted in the C-Net review. Watching all HD stations. The picture is bright enough during the day and really pops at night with the lights out. So far no image retention with the station logo bugs, although I try and avoid those stations that do not use shadow logos. Watched a football game on Sunday with no adverse efects. Not into 3-D, so I can't comment. No buzzing noted,unless you go around to the back of the set and put your ear six (6)inches from the panel. Given the price difference,the GT50 compares favorably with the Pioneer Kuro plasma in my other movie room.I don't use the GT50's speakers.  I bought a Zvox audio box and it works great with this set. My Time Warner remote is programed so that the set, cable box and Zvox turn on and off with a push of the systems button.  The only negative comment I have is the GT50 only has one optical audio out, which is needed for the Zvox connection. It's cheap and the clip that holds the cable broke off at setup.

What I did was just using the same movie disk and tried to adjust the picture using all available options provided on each of these model. Initially, I liked Sharp because of the size. After have done enough comparison, I settled with this. In my opinion, this is by far superior than the Sharp and Samsung. The black and white level on this set is deep black and white. People are saying that LED (Sharp) better for sport view (LED provide brighter picture on sport? more \"pop\") but in my opinion this plasma is still better with true color and bright on sport screen also.Absolutely, the default set up on this set is NOT good. THX mode may be better(great) for many people. But I used custom mode. I did not use calibration disk but have some knowledge on Photoshop on using color(RGB)/contract/brightness adjustments.

There is a slight buzz on heavily white screens, but it's inaudible unless there is absolutely no sound in the room and I'm standing about 3-4 feet away. Not a problem, and that's common with plasma's.I'm coming from a 4 year old Sony Bravia LCD (KDL-40V2500) that is one of the highest reviewed HDTVs ever. I will say that this picture is a bit softer at first and it takes a little getting used to after watching the sharpness LCD's are capable of. In reality, the picture on the Panny is more natural but after being used to the pop of my Sony it does seem of a lesser quality at first. I've been watching the TV for the last few days and as I get closer to the 100 hour break in I can tell the PQ is improving. It's a beautiful picture, period. I'm still messing around trying to get the best picture possible, but it seems like most of the known websites (AVS/HighDef Junkie forums, CNET, TweakTV.com) only have the ST50 model's calibrated. Should make an even nicer picture once we get those in!*Update 6/24* Cnet has finally posted their calibration settings for this TV here:[...]I used the same exact settings except I bumped up the contrast to 84 instead. Suffice to say, the picture looks brilliant and it has certainly minimized that \"softness\" I first experienced (though I did get used to it a bit more anyway)! This is an amazing TV... hope everyone enjoys these settings as much as I am so far. For all you videophiles, I did do the 100 hour prep for D-Nice's calibration settings that he has yet to post but these settings are wonderful as they are and I'm interested to see if his will actually improve the way it looks. Can't imagine how!*Update 7/31/2013* Absolutely love this TV, and found a solution to the buzzing issue.It looks like the buzzing sound so many complain about (I had no issues with it until recently) is coming from the top right ventilation area that's pretty much a square. Inside, you can see a but of steel and I believe something in there is causing that to vibrate. The good news is, the vibrations are not the problem, it's the dust that gathers on it that makes the buzzing noise. So if you get an air duster and use your fingers to focus the red straw blowing the air out directly into the vent holes, the dust will come off and the buzzing sound will be virtually eliminated, even when it's on the brightest screens!", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture Quality", "Author": "plasmalover", "ReviewID": "R25QOSYB2F27PD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In the Standard Mode the picture quality is good but only when you see the Blu Ray Disc that you will see the actual quality of the TV.

I have spent over $1600 and have nothing more than a paper weight.  Upon receiving the TV, there was no external damage.  Plugged TV in and worked for an hour.  Then screen does not turn on and I see a red light blinking 8 times.  Contacted Panasonic and they indicated I need to get it repaired under warranty as internal boards need to be replaced.  They estimated work would be completed in 2 days.  I figured well 2 days is quicker than returning the TV since it was an internet purchase.  Well, they were wrong as it took two weeks for the contracted repair company to fix my TV!  So finally I think the problem is fixed, then boom 3 days later the same problem happens again.  TV turns on then kicks right back off and 8 blinking red lights.  Panasonic tells me that I need to take the TV to the repair company that is over an hour away from where I live.  I tell them that is impossible and that I want a completely new replacement TV.  My claim is now escalated and now I have been waiting for over a week for their decision.  I have called numerous times and Panasonic will not let me speak to anyone with power to make a decision.  I called today asking why they told me I should get my TV repaired instead of returning it to the internet site I purchased from and they told me it is Panasonic's policy to not recommend returning their product.  They want you to get their product fixed under warranty.  So hopefully people know now to avoid Panasonic and their warranty services.  Pansonic's customer service is a joke.  Avoid this company.

In reference to the customer service; once you get past the standard call center it improves significantly.  Hopefully, this new set will not have the same issue.  I will update this review further whether or not the problem manifests itself again.END UPDATELast month my wife finally agreed to let me purchase a new HDTV.  After doing an obsessive amount of research I settled on this model.  Being that this is a plasma TV, and knowing of the \"burn-in\" issues in the past, I made sure to read quite a bit about how to avoid it.  Most of what I came across simply stated that it isn't really a problem these days as long as you have a \"break-in\" period of about 100 hours.Unfortunately, that will not help if you are hard-of-hearing and must use subtitles.  After just three weeks of owning the television there were now two bars at the bottom of the screen that are darker than the rest of the display.  These are caused by subtitles displaying in that area (even though subtitles aren't actually a static image).  After hunting around online for a possible fix I read that it could just be mild image retention and I should just give it a few days and use the \"scrolling bar\" option on the TV.So, I stopped using subtitles for 3 weeks and, instead, just relied on some headphones.  Unfortunately, they are still there, and will most likely remain there.  I called Panasonic customer service to see what could be done.  I explained that I'm hard-of-hearing and I have to have subtitles.  They replied that \"burn-in\" only really happens if you watch the same thing for many days in a row and that I should use the \"scrolling bar\" tool frequently.  I informed them that I don't watch the same thing all the time, and that I do use the scrolling bar occasionally, but nowhere near frequently because that wasn't stated anywhere in the manual.  Then they just casually told me there's nothing they can really do since I left a static image on the TV for too long.  I explained that, had I known that subtitles (which wouldn't strike me as a static image) would cause damage to my expensive display, then I would not have purchase the TV in the first place.I hate rating this product low because the display really is absolutely gorgeous.  I just can't recommend it to anyone with a hearing disability knowing that they will damage their TV.

But the blacks on this set are exceedingly good and the colors, contrast, brightness and so on seem at least as good as the old set. UPDATE 1/28/2013: We watched Downton Abbey last night on this TV and I want to revise my comments on picture quality: It is not just OK; it is, to borrow another reviewer's term, staggeringly good and you really have to watch this kind of show in a well-darkened room to understand just how good it is. If, upon further investigation, I find that the DLNA and IP camera issues can be resolved, I'd give it the maximum number of stars.Another online merchant lists this at a cheaper price and Amazon credited my account for the difference. How can other merchants possibly compete with Amazon's excellence?The set swivels on it's base and has a nice bezel.Much has been written about the G series offering very little over the S series when actually there are quite a few extras: THX settings, the swiveling base, dual core processor, nicer bezel, 4 HDMI ports instead of 3, 24,576 shades of gradation (whatever that is) instead of 12,288, Pure Direct (whatever that is) and a PC input. For the extra money you do seem to get a lot.The sound is much better than our old Panasonic.THE NOT SO GOODPanasonic advertises that this TV will work with the BL-210A Panasonic IP camera but it does not. I put the issue to them on their website and got this response: 'We regret to inform you that your TV does not support the use of Network Cameras'. So why do they say it does in their ads?If you're thinking that DLNA would be nice to have -- and Panasonic certainly makes it sound so wonderful and simple -- don't. Just google 'Panasonic Viera DLNA' to see how great it is. Now you might be thinking all those frustrated people have only themselves to blame for trying to run files that they know or should know are unsupported. Or you might be thinking -- and I wouldn't blame you because you'd be right -- that satisfied customers are usually silent about things that work. All I can say is that if you feel lucky, go ahead and buy the set, try to run your 'supported files' and see what happens. UPDATE 2/3/2013: I kept up trying to get DLNA to work and I think I found the solution. Get the Mezzmo media server. My movies now run fine on this TV and without any audio lag. Mezzmo transcodes very fast so there isn't any stuttering either.On a related note, DLNA does work with music stored on your computer but there's a problem: The visual interface for DLNA music sits there on your TV all the time the music is being played so you really can't use the music feature at all unless you're playing something for just a minute or two or else you don't care if your screen gets burned in with the image of the interface. UPDATE 2/3/2013: The set does in fact have a very nice screen saver.

Those familiar with older CRT monitors will know exactly what I mean.  I did some reading on this as it was bugging the heck outta me.  I found that there is a small percentage of folks that can see this.  In essence, the brighter areas appear to flicker and suffered from horrible dirty screen effects.  Everything white appeared beige to me.  My wife, who is not so sensitive, says she can kind of see it only when I pointed it out.  For me, it felt like my eyes were constantly trying to adjust and resulted in strain and, eventually, a nauseating feeling would come over me.  I then decided to return this unit and pay a little more for the VT50 as it's refresh rate was supposedly higher.  This time I decided to go to a local Best Buy to see it first.  Glad I did!!

Bottom line, if you are skeptical of buying a $1899 TV over the internet and having it delivered, you might want to try and get someone local to match the price rather than going through this.

And I'm pretty glad I did. I see a lot of other reviewers here that are a lot more verbose and detailed, so I'm going to keep this simple.::::::::::: What I like/love :::::::::::- Picture Quality.  STUNNING! I have never seen black levels this deep. It's such a treat to watch.- Apps: I love the Netflix, Amazon TV, YouTube, etc. The picture quality watching Netflix movies on here is truly stunning.  Not to mention, it's extremely convenient.- Wireless connectivity:  Saves me from running another cable.- Thin:- AMAZON's speedy shipping! I will never buy a TV from anywhere else. Scheduled delivery is the way to go. Amazon delivered it faster than my local Best Buy (I checked)!  The delivery guys were friendly, helpful and made sure it worked before they left.::::::::::: Shortcomings ::::::::::::- Weight: As with most plasmas, this thing is relatively heavy.  I'll spare you the details, but it made mounting more painful than it needed to be.- Isn't edge-to-edge display:  It's not particularly great to look at when it's turned off. It's not ugly by any means, but it's not like the new LCDs from Sammy and LG.  If you want more of the \"single pane of glass\" look, step up to the VT50 series.- Burn-in:  When it starts up initially, you can distinctly notice burn-in when the Smart Viera logo disappears.  This goes away quickly and you don't notice it after that initial moment, but I wish plasmas found a way around this.- Stand:  Good thing I'm mounting it on the wall.  But seriously Panasonic, take a look at some of your competitors here.- No built-in camera: Some other TVs like Samsung come with cameras built in. Panny wants me to pay $150 for a additional camera so I can Skype? Come on.Overall, I am very happy, both with this TV and with how Amazon handled delivery.

I relly wanted this TV to be great. I liked this HDTV when it was delivered. Delivery was 1 hr. later than the 3 hour range the CEVA Home delivery Co. allotted me. I was not happy about that. Delivery guys were polite, set up the TV on it's stand and placed in room, plugged in and I had cable TV working. Later on that evening I noticed several pixels were not working. These pixels would be either fully on \"bright white\" or off, no in between colors or illumination increments.  Had to send the TV back for replacement. Manufacturers defect. received the new replacement in 10 days. Replacement TV seemed ok for a while (3 months). Then Panasonic sent a software update (via the internet wich was working at the time) to the VIERA Connect Software and asked me to install it in order to update my firmware and get on the internet. The software update corrupted my in-board Wi-Fi receiver that is built in to the TV. I no longer can receive Wi-Fi signals from my router. The TV will only allow Ethernet hookup now. Panasonic seems to have no fix for this. I am waiting ( it has been 5 days to be called back for a in home service call to see if they will fix this, replace the Wi-Fi module, or replace the entire TV). customer service seems not to know what to so with this. My other complaint is using the remote to move the pointer while on the internet is clunky and I much would have preferred a touch-pad or joystick built into the remote. With color adjustments the set looks very good, and I noticed the input source now shows more all the defects of the programming. Even with a great TV a poorly shot scene or badly digitized DVD won't look good, but the major News stations look great. Nice TV. I had hope to be able to enjoy the new one for a long time... but I am disappointed with Panasonic as a company and am fearful this product I have purchased three months ago is a lemon and that Panasonic is not to concerned with fixing my Wi-Fi problem.

In other words, in a bright environment, the TV is not bright enough2) It does not come with a manual.  It suppose to come with built-in help on the TV, which is not easy to use or navigate.  Also, when you have a printed User Manual, you can read through the manual to know what features does your TV have, but with the built-in manual, you need to magically know about the feature, then you can pick the information about it to read.  This is very unacceptable to me.3) The TV has no line out for speakers.  In other words, I can NOT use my audio transmitter required by my wireless headset4) You basically keep on fighting with Viera link as it tries to do controls for you that you do not expect.  I bought Panasonic SC-BTT490 home theater when I bought this TV, which I thought it would simplify my integration, but not happy with the results at all.  They try to turn on/off things (line in/out, video/audio and signals) as \"they think\" is needed which many times does not match what I would like to have5) When I connected a 3D Sony Camera, sometimes it would detect it and other times it wouldn't detect it, but I couldn't see images simply by connecting that camera to the TV.  I was able thought to see the picture by hooking the same camera to the Panasonic home theater!6) Not great picture when the contents is not High Def.7) Worse of all, I found out last week I do have screen burns (they call it: \"Image Retention\" I guess to take the negativity out of it).  I've used a plasma TV for about 10 years before and I still do not have screen burns.  I do not use the TV for more than 10 hours a week.  I do not expect to have screen burns this fast.

I installed it at home and the picture was stunning expect for a big issue.  Skin and earth tones cannot be dialed in.  Now, i could have lived with these tones carrying too much green or purple yet this is one area that a TV simply must nail.  So, I took it back and continued my research and decided to reach for the best thinking it was this Panasonic plasma.I installed it a week ago and returned it today.  It would be nice to blend the best of this TV and the Samsung that I also returned.  This TV nailed skin and earth tones perfectly but everything is slightly blurry and just not crisp.  Also the darks often blend together.  It's like I keep struggling for more light as if I have sunglasses on watching it.  I had 20 people over this weeked and had them compare the 55\" Samsung LED (2 years old) in my rec room with this new 60\" Panasonic plasma.  Every single person said the Samsung was significantly better without exception.  With that confirmation I hung my head.  Two 60\" TVs installed and returned.  This really stinks.Despite all of the reviews, the plasma's just aren't impressive.  All I looked at suffered from the same lack of picture clarity...all.  To aggravate matters, Samsung dominates the LED market but in the past 2 years quality has plunged, products are buggy, just too many issues.  Now as a customer we have no where to turn.  Yes, there are other pretty good TVs but no better than these two in their respective areas.What did I do?  Ugh.  I bought the Visio 60\" LED at sub-$900.  Yea, it's a hair less nice than the others but it is also only 30-50% of the cost.  What gets me is why the reviewers and ratings people don't respond more sharply.

I am writing this review as a warning to anyone who buys a Panasonic Plasma and then experiences a problem.On October 3rd of this year the set made a mild pop and roughly 4 inches of the picture went black from top to bottom. Since I was still in warranty I called the Panasonic Service Center. What follows is a condensed chronology my experience.10/3 Initial call to report the problem. They said they needed a copy of my receipt.10/4 I emailed receipt10/5 Received confirmation warranty coverage from Panasonic and was told their service provider would contact me.10/8 Service provider called to set appt for afternoon on 10/10.10/10 Took partial day off from work to be home for service provider. Was stood up. Can't really blame Panasonic for this but still not good.10/11 Called Panasonic and the service provider. After another followup on 10/13 a new appt was set for 10/16.10/16 Service provider's tech confirms the problem. She tests it and says the problem is the panel itself not the associated electronics. She says they or Panasonic will call back.10/20 After hearing nothing, I call Panasonic's Customer Service Center. They say the panel is back-ordered for 3-4 weeks.  The customer service rep can tell me nothing more and will not pass me to a supervisor.They say I will be notified when they have a more certain date.10/20 to 11/05 Multiple calls and a letter to the Panasonic Customer Service Center with the only result being that I get form letter responses saying \"Thank you for contacting Panasonic. Your documents have been received and forwarded to the proper department for review.\"11/6 Panasonic Customer Service Center called and said they decided to replace my set with a TC-P65GT50. They can't give a shipping date but I'm happy with the resolution regardless of the delay, because I ASSUME they will give it some priority due to the time already elapsed.11/12 Since I still haven't been given a delivery date, I call Panasonic's Customer Service Center again for an update. I'm told the set was actually shipped on 11/2 and I should have it by the end of the week (11/16).11/16 More time off work to be sure I'm around for the delivery. When nothing has arrived by mid-afternoon I call the Service Center again. The agent says that the set shipped on the second and that it takes from 7 - 10 business days to arrive. Then she realized that the 16th was 10 business days. She would not let me talk to a supervisor but said she would \"escalate\" and I would hear more in 24 - 48 hours.11/17 (today) I received a call from someone on their escalation team saying that they didn't know where the set was and they would follow up in three to five business days. Not that the set would be here, but they would follow up.Panasonic's Concierge Warranty, under which this set is covered, states most problems are resolved in two business days. I realize two days is unreasonable in some cases, and a defective panel is almost certainly one of those cases. However, it took almost two weeks to even get someone to look at the set and now we are at a month and a half and counting.Panasonic's Plasmas certainly seem to be one of the better performing televisions on the market but you better hope you never have a problem with it because they apparently feel no loyalty to their customers.

My initial reaction was how much better the picture was!  Sharper, clearer, and most impressive are the black levels.  The black is \"black\" not grayish, like on the Samsung. I continue to be impressed with the quality of the picture every time I'm watching it.  The features it comes with are great too. The SmartTV features are nice and well done, making them easy to use.  Being able to wirelessly view photos, videos & play music from my smartphone or tablet on this TV is so great.  Being able to control the TV via those same devices is also cool, although I'm not sure it would ever be necessary (unless I lost the remote).  I was expecting this newer TV to generate less heat than my old plasma, but it seems to generate just as much.One interesting thing about this unit compared to the 42\" Samsung, is that since the bezel is so small on this TV, the overall unit height is identical to the 42\" and the width is almost the same too.  So, 8\" bigger picture, in the same overall space.  Kinda cool.I have not used the 3D feature as this is not why I bought this TV. I actually have no interest in watching in 3D, nor do I want to pay my cable provider a premium to do so, nor do I want to spend more money on DVDs to get 3D versions, plus I don't want to pay for glasses to do this watching of 3D.  3D is simply not that important to me. It does not enhance my TV/Movie watching. I mostly find it annoying.  But it is nice to know that this TV *is* capable of doing 3D should I (or anyone in my household) decide to watch in 3D at some point in the future.I only have one complaint. The speakers make a vibration sound occasionally - kind of like a buzzing, humming or rattling. I'm not turning up the volume too loud, it's just at normal listening volume and happens from any source.  I called Amazon & Panasonic about it and they said it shouldn't do that so Amazon is arranging to have a new one delivered to replace the one I got.

It was no hassle at all to get it set up and they were more than happy to do it!  I've had the new one for about a week and haven't heard the buzzing on this one.I still love this TV but do have one complaint about the picture.During fast lighting changes (like during a concert with lots of flashing lights) the picture gets very \"blocky\" or maybe \"pixelated.\"  I'm not sure if this is a source problem (as this was on HD TV stations watching via my HD Tivo) or if it is problem with the TV itself, or maybe all plasmas behave this way.

While doing so, I found another setting hidden under \"HDMI Settings\" called \"HDMI/DVI RGB range\" that controls the range of colors the tv detects. Changing this from \"Auto\" to \"NonStandard\" (other option was Standard(16-235)) allowed the TV to show the detail in the dark scenes.Now, there are only two SMALL issues I found with the Panasonic P55GT50:First, is that it has trouble with very bright colors next to small patches of other bright colors. But this problem is MUCH smaller than the loss of detail I was experiencing before. If you've tried out Thor, go to 16:01 - 16:03, the scene after Loki convinces Thor to attack Jotunheim, where Thor, the warriors 3 and the girl warrior go to meet Heimdall on the rainbow bridge to take the gateway to Jotunheim. Towards the end of the little standoff. In this scene, Thor is extremely brightly lit on the right side of his face and his cheek is right next to a bright light. On the Panasonic L47DT50 you can still see a little of the color of his cheek and some detail on his forehead. On the Panasonic P55gt50 you can't see any of the color of his cheek - only white and his forehead looks more white and flat vs on the Panasonic L47DT50 it looks like his forehead has some contours but is reflecting harsh light.Second, is that the P55GT50 had some trouble tracking a bright portion of a scene against a dark portion of a scene of Kingdom of Heaven towards the beginning. For those of you that want to test this out: pop in the blu-ray and go to the first scene where they're feasting in a castle. At 7:52 there's a very bright spot on some guy's nose that moves across the screen as the camera pans along the darkly lit room. This bright spot does not move in sync with the rest of his face and judders a little. I will have my friend over again if possible and try motion smoothing and see if that takes care of the issue. I'll also post the exact time this occurs on the blu-ray instead of having to describe the scene, but he's got the movie with him!However, the overall color accuracy of the P55GT50 was obviously superior to the two LCD's and the choice of which has the best picture is now much more subjective. My friend, who is a photographer and graphic artist, came over last night and did these comparisons with me and said he preferred the picture of the Panasonic P55GT50(even with the two small issues discussed previously) to the picture of the Panasonic L47DT50 and certainly over the picture of the Samsung LN52C630 because of the color accuracy. I'm still very focused on picture detail, and so think I prefer the Panasonic L47DT50 because it did not have problems with the detail and the tracking of the bright spot in the dark scene. However, I must admit, the picture of the Panasonic L47DT50 did look less \"real\" in many scenes than on the Panasonic P55GT50. I would now give this TV a 4.5 if possible. But have upgraded the stars to 4. For a product like this you need more fine tuning of the stars! I guess Amazon will do the fine tuning by averaging the reviews and showing that in the star rating!I appreciate the comments on my previous review as it prompted me to find this new setting which addressed the issues I was having. I'm not sure why the tv did not set this correctly as it was on \"Auto\", but if you have this TV, pause a movie on a dark scene and go check to see whether you should change this setting \"HDMI/DVI RGB Range\" under \"HDMI settings\".ORIGINAL POST 4/27/2012:Original Title: \"Rich Picture: But loss of detail not acceptable\"I reread this review after making all sorts of edits and wanted to make it a little easier to understand. So, the summary is this: on brighter scenes, the P55GT50 has a rich picture, but details in darker sections get completely lost by this tv and dark movies are almost completely unwatchable. That pretty much kills the TV for me. Also, 3d crosstalk is low, but with the darkness problems on even 2D, the added darkness with 3D makes 3D on darker scenes really bad.For those of you out there on a quest for the best value for a tv around $1500  plus or minus $500, read on:This review is mostly about the Panasonic P55GT50, but I have compared it with 4 other tvs:Samsung LN52C630: 52\" 2008 or 2009 model LCD TV I've owned for 2 years. Does not have 3d.Panasonic L47DT50: 47\" 2012 model LCD TV I just purchased. Active 3d.LG 47LW5600: 47\" 2011 model LCD tv that I just returned. Passive 3d.Sony 46EX723: 46\" 2011 model LCD tv that I just returned. Active 3d.The picture on Panasonic P55GT50 does look very rich, I'll give it that. But, darker material with lots of shades of darkness becomes totally black - with no detail in the dark scenes. Two examples of material which become frustrating to watch are: Thor(with Natalie Portman) and The Killing(Mireille Enos). The first scene of Thor is a great stress test for most tvs in particular.I spent 4 days showing HBO on the plasma to go through the break in period even though Panasonic says you don't need to do break in anymore on plasmas.I bought an HDMI splitter so that I could see the picture side by side with two other televisions: a Samsung LCD model LN52C630(2008 or 2009 model, I can't remember) and a Panasonic LCD model TC-L47DT50(2012 model). So, I had all three set up right next to each other with the same picture.The dark details were not there on the Panasonic p55gt50. I tried tweaking the settings for a long time. Even with brightness/contrast/sharpness turned all the way up, couldn't make out the details in dark spots that I could with the other two sets. Especially in Thor, I was constantly frustrated by not being able to see detail that was clear on the other sets I compared with the Panasonic P55GT50. I wanted to love this TV. But I can't be constantly frustrated that I can't make out the details in dark scenes. My mother is as far from a videophile as you can get. As long as the content is good she's happy. But, even she could clearly see what I was talking about.Now for the background and comparison with other TVs:The reason I bought the Panasonic L47DT50 and the Panasonic P55GT50 was because I was looking for good 3d with no crosstalk. I had previously bought a sony KDL-46EX723(2011 model) with horrible 3d crosstalk(2d picture was pretty good though.) Then I tried an LG 47LW5600 that had very little 3d crosstalk. But the lost resolution due to the passive 3d was too frustrating.Also, the input lag was HORRIBLE on the LG. For those who don't know, \"input lag\" is the amount of time it takes between when a signal reaches the TV and when the picture for that signal gets displayed on the screen. I later found out that some technical websites had clocked the input lag for the LG 47LW5600 at .15 seconds. This makes gaming very difficult. You're always a split second behind the action.When I first plugged in the XBOX360 to the splitter and hooked up the panasonic L47DT50 and the LG 47LW5600, I was amazed to be able to see and hear the delay on the LG when I clicked through the menus. I always thought people were nit-picking over input lag issues - not any more. Also, the 2d picture quality on the LG was pretty poor. Back the LG 47LW5600 went to the store.Even though the Panasonic L47DT50 beat the heck out of the LG 47LW5600 as far as input lag, the Panasonic L47DT50 does not have great input lag measurements either - about .05 seconds. The best LCD gaming monitors have input lags down to around .01 seconds and most large(>40\") LCD tvs have input lags around .03 seconds. The gold standard as far as input lag are the old analog CRT sets.Some sites claim that with the new processing LCD makers are adding to increase picture quality these input lag issues are becoming worse and older LCD models do not suffer as much in general. I can't verify that. I did not do a side by side input lag test with xbox on the samsung ln52c630 and the two panasonics - had that set up in another room - sorry!I've had a hard time finding input lag measurements on this Panasonic p55gt50. Either the Panasonic L47DT50 or the Panasonic p55gt50 is a little ahead of the other as I can hear the ping from the XBOX360 on one tv before the other as I click between menus - but I can't tell which one is moving first! So, they're pretty close. The Panasonic p55gt50 is probably the faster one as plasmas are usually faster than LCDs.Anwyay, for now I'm keeping the Panasonic l47dt50 and returning the Panasonic p55gt50(yay amazon 30 day TV returns). Besides being able to see details in dark scenes, Panasonic L47DT50 weighs a heck of a lot less and doesn't make any buzzing noise unlike the Panasonic p55gt50 which DOES make a buzzing noise during bright scenes. Also, the Panasonic p55gt50 takes more power. When I turn it on, the fan in the true-online UPS I have the entertainment center hooked up to goes into REALLY LOUD speed.This was the first time I've been so picky about TVs. What really sparked it off was the horrible 3D crosstalk on the Sony.Crosstalk is what happens when you're watching 3d and the tv is not separating the right eye image and the left eye image completely. So you get a little bit of the image from one eye in the other eye and what you the effect is that you see a slight double image.Well, the 3D crosstalk on the Sony was so horrible that it looked like you were getting all of each image in both eyes for the top half of the screen. The middle/lower was better and then the bottom had horrible crosstalk again. After finding this out, I went searching on the internet and found that this was a well known problem and that the Sony KDL-46ex723 was widely recognized as having horrible 3d performance.I felt tricked and vowed that if I was spending upwards of 1k on a TV I was not going to put up with horrible performance and dishonest advertising - I think a class action lawsuit against Sony for advertising that the Sony KDL-46EX723 has 3d should be taken up by some lawyers! So, I started buying and returning TVs and doing lots of tests at home!The best 3d source right now is the Playstation 3. You can watch 3d blu-rays, stream 3-d content through the playstation store (i bought a 3-d safari show through the the playstation store that was really cool) and play many of PS3's greatest games in 3d. 3D video games are awesome. For example playing Uncharted on a large screen in 3d is really, really cool. Beyond that, IMAX nature shows converted to 3d blu-ray are also very cool. I bought imax sharks 3d on blu-ray and that was awesome.Anyway, the 3d crosstalk on the Panasonic P55GT50 is very low. The Panasonic p55gt50 does fail 3D crosstalk torture tests where you have bright white juxtaposed to deep black - there is some crosstalk there. But, I don't think I've seen any 3D display technology that doesn't fail those tests. Now that I've become so tuned in to this issue, I can see it even in some IMAX 3D movies under very difficult 3d conditions and on my nintendo 3ds in certain circumstances. And both IMAX and 3ds have very good separation of images between the eyes - very little crosstalk. The Panasonic P55GT50 is not quite as good as the Panasonic L47DT50 on crosstalk issues and neither is as good as IMAX, Nintendo 3DS or LG passive 3d on crosstalk alone. Of course, the LG loss of detail due to the passive separation technique was a deal breaker.Because of the input lag issue on the Panasonic l47dt50, I'm considering returning the Panasonic l47dt50 and buying a cheaper set and waiting to drop a couple grand on a 4K tv or OLED a few years from now.

I always had enabled the anti imaging feature and regularly used the built in anti image sweeps for 10-15 minutes. The static images of channels that have scrolling at the bottom is also still mildly visible. You have to be careful keeping the contrast below 50 and keep changing the channel to avoid these.

However, in application there is a lot to be desired.The main reason I chose this TV was due to all of the apps/features built in as well as the concurrent customer reviews.  That being said, I returned the TV due to it's complete inability to live up to those standards.The Problems:1) Be very aware that most Panasonic devices have a known issue with the Netflix streaming app built into their units; TV's, Blu-Ray etc.  I wish I had discovered this issue sooner or I wouldn't have purchased the TV.  The Netflix app with frequently flicker black during playback, which is very distracting.  Imagine someone walking in front of you while trying to watch a movie...every 45 seconds.  Oh, it's just because you are using the wireless instead of a LAN connection. FALSE. And what is the point of having wireless if it isn't fast enough to stream?  Oh, it's because your internet isn't fast enough.  FALSE.  6MBps is ample for HD streaming.The moral:  If you are planning on using this TV to stream Netflix, for the love of beans, don't buy it.2) I had the TV for a total of 3 weeks and I already had \"residual images\" aka SCREEN BURN.  Oh, all you have to do is use the \"Anti-Image Retention\" feature for 15 mins and it will solve the problem.  False.  Oh, you have to run it for 1 hour continuously while frequently resetting the \"Anti-Image Retention\" feature.  FALSE and WTF?  Who is going to sit in front of the TV for an hour while a white bar wipes across the screen?The moral:  If you think screen burn on Plasmas are a thing of the past, sweet Jimeny Cricket, don't buy it.3) Initial set up on this TV will take you over an hour.  I think a monkey with astigmatism set the defaults for picture quality and resolution.  Not to mention, when I called the customer support hotline they told me they could fix all of my woes by hitting a combo of buttons that will fix my Netflix blackouts and screen burn...In fact, all it did was reset everything on my TV I spent precious time configuring, including accounts, passwords, presets, etc.  Woulda been nice if the support people mentioned that BEFORE wiping everything.The moral:  If you think setting this TV up is a breeze, or that VIERA support is helpful, Holy guacamole, don't but it.4)  Energy sucking.

More annoying things about this TV... Ads when I change the volume while using a Viera App like Vudu? What? Cannot change the Freq when watching some 3D sources or playing 3D games. Supposedly using the 48Hz vs 60Hz would improve the ghosting, but cannot change the option while playing games on PS3... and it didn't appear to make much difference for the movies I tried. I played Motorstorm 3D Rift, Resistance 3, Zen Pinball2.. all showed considerable ghosting... and no ability to switch to 48Hz option. I watched Avatar, Avengers, and a few online 3D movies.

We got a call from Pilot that the TV was to be delivered the next day. We explained that since we live in the desert about 20 miles from town, and because GPS will not get you to our house (We have three GPS gadgets and none of them will get us home from Tucson on paved roads) that the driver be told to call us for directions. The next morning we get a call from the driver, he is stuck in a sand wash with a big delivery truck about 5 miles from our home. This is a wash, not a road and has a BLM sign saying that. He stated that no one had told him to call for directions. He asked if I could come to him to get the TV, so we took our Polaris Ranger and a log chain through the desert to find him. The truck is buried and he had walked to a ranch to see if they had a tractor to help him out. They woke up a lady truck driver and got her to bring her tractor to the truck where we used our chain to eventually get the truck back to the road. While she was pulling him out backward the truck was hooping violently this concerned me and I told him we did not want to take delivery as this was a plasma TV and I did not think that traveling down a rough dirt road and the banging around during the extended time the truck was being towed out was a good thing. He begged me to take it since they would check it out on delivery and Amazon had a 30 day return policy.They bring it into our house and turn it on, no apparent problems. They give me the delivery receipt to sign and there right across the middle is a hand written note to Please call for directions. After they left we removed the carton to find that the bottom was covered with some kind of black oily grime and it had been deposited all over our living room carpet. We spent an hour and three towels trying to clean it up and never were able to get it all out. They had slid the box across the room and left a nice trail of grime.Now to the TV, It performs fine right out of the box, though we did have to set the video to the lighter cinema setting even in a fairly dark room. I noticed that all of the preset video modes have the brightness control set at +50, I wonder why, is this a clue that future brightness may be a problem? I also noticed that changing brightness from the lowest setting to the highest did not noticeably change the picture.I have a few issues with a set of this quality and price range in that the only audio output connections are HDMI or Optical. The internal speaker is crap, a small poor quality cone facing the wall. If you have a non-Viera sound bar without HDMI or optical inputs as I do you have to buy a digital to analog converter and optical cable to hook it up and you have to use a separate remote or change devices to control the volume. My high end 5 year old theater system also only has RCA jacks. Can you believe there are no RCA jacks at all on this unit and no headset jack either on a $2000 TV? The 42\" Samsung this replaced has every style of input and output jack known to man! This is an obvious scheme to make you have to purchase all Panasonic peripherals with Viera in order to use the system conveniently. A $2000 TV and a cabinet full of electronics only to have to spend another $300 or more for a Viera sound bar to hear it. Just not right!The 3D and Smart features are a waste of money, I think for most people. Most of the features came on the Panasonic Blu- ray player I purchased with the TV. 3D is more trouble and expense then its worth at least to me.In the end I probably could have spent half as much on a TV and gotten the things I needed and been just as happy with the picture. I would have avoided the idiot delivery guy, picked it up at the store and not have to have our carpet professionally cleaned.Update 11-19-12 after a month of use.Today we turned on the TV and both my wife and I noticed a distinct darkening of the picture. I checked the video mode that we have set to cinema to provide a brighter picture and now found weUpdate 11-27-12All looks great on the THX cinema setting and to answer the comment, yes the C.A.T.S. is off and always has been.

But whenever I switch to 3D, it plays for 2 seconds and then shuts the TV off and a red light blinks 8 times then repeats. The only way to start the TV again is to unplug it and then replug it in.

HD programming does not even look like HD...it literally looks like standard definition...very soft and poorly defined. Watching HD programming is what I use the tv for 95% of the time, so I have no choice but to return this. It's not about calibration or adjustments, it's just the nature of this tv. The other thing that will drive you crazy is the difference in picture quality when switching channels. After adjusting the picture to get it to look best on one channel, it looks totally different on another channel...what are you supposed to do...adjust the picture every time you change the channell? There is no calibration that will make the tv look good for general all around everyday use. Maybe it's all the picture processing they do now, I don't know, but the result is major step down from my 10 year old 720p Sony plasma. I'm a little worried because the the delivery person took the box with him. I'm going to have to call them to see if they still have it...I sure hope I can return this, because there is just no way live with it.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture.", "Author": "William Adams", "ReviewID": "RZZ4BHISAC425", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this product less than two months when there was a failure in the electronics.

I will post their response at the end.After researching for some time, we came to the conclusion that this product was overall best out there.  We have been enjoying it for a month now, and the picture is indeed the best we have ever seen.  Some of the features you offered were the deciding factors to spend the extra money for your product.  However, our research was flawed.  We didn't take into account for the exorbitant cost of your 3D glasses.  The big features we wanted were all the apps, and particularly the Skype feature since all of our children have grown and moved all over the country. So we Skype frequently. Since we have many high end Skype cameras, we didn't think we had to buy those expensive cameras that your HDTV requires. We can't see why you have to make the TV so only the most expensive cameras will work on your set. We saved for years to buy your product, only to find we now have to spend considerably more for a camera and your 3D glasses.  Yet most other TV retailers over as many as 6 sets of 3D glasses with the initial TV purchase. Again, we don't see why your accessories need to be priced so incredibly high.But then we found, that most of your apps need additional purchases to use as well, i.e. subscription charges.  Even the internet browser doesn't work very well. So the initial cost of the set, basically just gives us an HDTV, and everything else is extra.  We feel you should make that very clear in all of your advertising. Paying over $2000 for basically just a 60\" TV is kind of exorbitant, considering there are many HDTV's that are a little more than a 1/4 to a 1/3 of that price.  Sure, your product has a great picture, but 4 times as much for that picture is more than what we think is reasonable.Then to top it off, we have to see a commercial banner every time we turn the set on.  What is that about?  We have never seen or heard of such a thing.Your Mission statement:\"Recognizing our responsibilities as industrialists, we will devote ourselves to the progress and development of society and the well-being of people through our business activities, thereby enhancing the quality of life throughout the world.\"\" We strive for the creation of new values, by pursuing user-friendliness and accomplishing high-tech mindset, driven by challenging spirits and full speed of actions. \"isn't reflected in what we have found with this particular product.  Again, yes, your product offers a great picture, but all of the \"Bells and Whistles\" that are advertised as part of the product will cost your customer hundreds of dollars to use or enjoy.  And that should be made clear to every purchaser.Paying hundreds of dollars more for these extra items might not seem like a lot for you and your executives.  But the average consumer, particularly people on fixed incomes, who stretched their budgets to buy your product in the first place, only to find they will have to shell out hundreds more to actually get full use of that product is just not fair.  We tried to return it, and buy one with the glasses included and cheaper ulternative cameras, but the retailer would not take it back.So now we are stuck with a beautiful HDTV, with a wonderful picture, but unable to use most of the features we bought the TV for in the first place.  And we feel, how does that meet your mission statement of \"user friendliness\"?It is a shame that such a quality company, with great products has to nickel and dime its customers, just to make a few more dollars.  Shame on Panasonic.A FEW DAYS LATER WE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM PANASONIC CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFERING TO DISCOUNT THE SKYPE CAMERA AND 3D GLASSES TO ONLY $10 MORE THAN WE CAN BUY THEM FOR ON AMAZON WITH NO TAX OR SHIPPING CHARGES FROM AMAZON. SO AMAZON IS THE PLACE TO BUY ANY AND ALL ACCESSORIES FOR THIS MODEL.THE CS REP ALSO WENT ON TO TELL US THAT PANASONIC DOESN'T INCLUDE 3D GLASSES WITH THEIR SETS, BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT THEM. AND THEY WANT TO KEEP CUSTOMER COSTS DOWN. THAT WAS BS AS WELL, SINCE THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER THEY CALLED, WE GET AN EMAIL OFFER FOR A PANASONIC VIERA 55\" Class ET5 Full HD 3D with 4 pairs of polarized 3D glasses. SO MUCH FOR PANASONIC'S INTEGRETY. THEY WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING TO JUST SHUT YOU UP AND GO AWAY.BUT DON'T GET US WRONG, THE ACTUAL TV OFFERS A VERY GOOD PICTURE.
