That TV made things look too \"cartoonish\" AND I have not experienced any audio syncing or juddering at all which I did with the LED.Initially, I only made two adjustments to my pictures settings. I set the black level to darkest and changed it to movie mode. This thing has an awesome picture without ANY calibration at all. However, I have since used calibration settings found on the AVS forum and they did enhance the picture even more.Internet: I have it hooked up via Ethernet and have really enjoyed having the ability to view Netflix movies, Amazon movies, Blockbuster movies and view the Facebook and YouTube widgets.Media: I was able so successfully stream music, pictures, and videos from my PC and a Flash Drive.Basically, almost every thing I was using on my PS3 in regards to internet, I am able to do with this TV.In summary:I'm totally in LOVE with this TV and hope it will last me many years.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fabulous TV with strong online features", "Author": "Hamish Macphail", "ReviewID": "R2Y09U0R6H1M6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Addressing the negatives others have mentioned re Samsung plasmas:Buzz:  Unless I'm totally deaf (I can still hear my baby yelling so I don't think so) this TV doesn't make any noise AT ALL.  Nada.  I can't even hear a cooling fan running when I'm standing next to it.  Total. Silence.Residual images:  I use a HTPC extensively and not noticed any residual images so far.Reflective screen:  It does have a glossy glass finish but as long as you're not sitting so you'll see a reflection from a window it's not an issue.  I don't see any glare from our couch.Reliability:  Delivered in perfect condition and it's not broken yet (only had it a week and will report back if it fails - I don't expect it too, seems well made)User account setup:  Creating a user account and putting in your IDs and passwords for Picasa etc. is painful using the 0-9 keypad on the remote.  Qwerty would be a nice option - but it's a once-only process so not a big deal for the inital account set up.  It does mean updating Facebook status or Tweeting isn't something you're going to do using the TV, until Qwerty is an option (like TiVo Premiere introducing a Qwerty remote soon).Positives:Beautiful unit:  Lovely glass one-piece screen and bezel.  I use the stand which is a really nice solid glass pivot version - much nicer than the fixed position plastic ones with cheaper models / other makers.  Came ready-attached to the TV.Picture:  As everyone else says, the picture's what you want - outstanding.  58\" is a wonderful size for a TV - the bezel is quite thin so although the screen area is almost twice what it was on the 42\" Hitachi it replaced, it doesn't take up that much more space in our living room.  Having said that, sitting next to the 42\" screen it did make it look like a portable.  And it cost less than the 720p 42\" TV I bought in 2006.Inputs:  Multiple inputs - although I only use one HDMI as it's hooked to a switched HDMI receiver.Samsung Apps:  These are really great - and despite the Samsung TV feature table not showing them as available on the C6500, I can confirm they ARE present in full on the PN58C6500.Netflix watch instantly is there but currently only shows your instant queue - you can't browse categories (which you can on PC, Roku or TiVo - expect this will get upgraded soon).Vudu is a GREAT service - HD movie streaming of the latest releases, instant BluRay quality on demand.  Fantastic.  The optical audio (SPDIF) output WILL send 5.1 Dolby Digital to your AV receiver if you're watching a 5.1 source (like Vudu).  Vudu is owned by Walmart and interestingly BestBuy have just got going with their rival service, CinemaNow - which looks very similar to Vudu (not tried it myself yet).  One limitation which only occurred to me after I got the TV - you can output digital audio from the TV but you can't output digital video signal e.g. to a projector.  So if you want to use Vudu for HD movie streaming on a projector, you'll need a separate box with Vudu built into it instead.Hulu Plus is there but it's a subscription only service - you can't use regular Hulu for free.  Still, it's a nice option.Lots of other usual suspects are there - Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps.  Picasa is there but surprisingly it won't play videos, only pictures (probably that will change with an upgrade too down the line.  While I was writing this the Pandora app updated itself automatically so they're constantly changing).All in all this is a great TV - full featured, beatifully made and with the excellent picture I expected.  An HDMI output would be nice for me so I could use Vudu / Netflix HD on my projector too, but I'm not aware of any TV which will do that (is anyone else?)UPDATE SEPT 26th:  Still loving this TV two months in.  In fact, the picture is so good and so nice to live with that it's making me unhappy with the picture I'm getting from my old Optoma HD72 projector - which by comparison looks too dim and soft (it's actually a pretty good picture, but the Samsung TV just steps all over it).  Avatar Bluray for example is outright stunning in its detail on the Samsung.  On the Optoma projector, it's just ok.  Checking if budget will allow upgrade to Epson 8500 ...", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not interested in 3D?, Great picture & value", "Author": "OLDKOZ", "ReviewID": "R3CFXMZ1KD953A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had my PN58C6400 (same as the C6500) for 3 weeks now.  Intially ordered a 2009 model from Amazon/Modia but it was out of stock and they upgraded to this 2010 model, nice.  Order arrived couple days early, opened & inspected the unit before signing for it (highly recommended)and had no damage. This was by far the biggest ticket item I'd web purchased but I was happy with the transaction and remain so.  Had not planned on wall mounting, but this 2010 unit is so thin (1.4\") that now I'm thinking about it. Have noticed NO buzzing or any other unsusal noises.  I did not \"burn in\" the screen with test slides like some techies like to do (think it unnessary).  I've just been sure initially to watch a variety of material, and always in wide-screen even if it means having to stretch the pciture to fit for 4:3 material.  Don't know what the internal speakers sound like and don't care as I haven't used anything in my main room but the surround system for 10 years now.  Suggest using direct high quality digital audio connections directly from sources to your Home theater system, not HDMI to the TV then back, which can limit return audio to only 2 channel.As for viewing sources and setup, I don't do any Gaming and I've yet to try any of the Internet features as my DSL sppeed needs to be upgraded to at least 3.5 mghz.  Watch mainly DISH HD programs and numerous Blu-ray movies.  Got on AVS Forum website for this Samsung model family and got some excellent setting recommendations which I use for my two input sources.  Use the \"Movie\" mode to have access to all adjustments, \"Standard\" has some disabled, and \"Relaxed\" and \"Dynamic\" even more are greyed out.  (If you initally find the Dynamic mode good, you'll quickly tire of it as it gets fatiguing to the eyes.) I had initially researched buying a LCD-LED unit but am very happy with this plasma.  Picture quality is outstanding and still promotes the \"wow\" factor.  The picture quality remains excellent from any angle and light relections don't seem to bother the picture nor are they visible. I've had no Image Retention problems (there are a couple of features built-in to prevent them) More importantly I've seen NO motion artifacts which are common on LCD TVs.  If you have no interest right now in 3D (I don't) and are looking for a great picture with deep blacks, & accurate color and video processing, this represents an excellent value.  Yeah it puts out a little heat, give it 4\" if clearance on each side for proper ventilation.  It also consumes a little more energy than an LCD , but I'm willing to pay for it and I don't live in California.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "will not warranty", "Author": "joecoopdog", "ReviewID": "R3P5VQOC3IS3JU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in Aug 2010 starting developing a 5-6\" thick horizontal pinkish magenta line in November and by end of November it was completely destructive to picture quality if anything light colored was present on the majority of screen, forget winter sports... I contacted Samsung who condemned the screen over the phone and promptly (2 weeks prompt) sent a technician over from 2 hours away at the only Samsung authorized service call facility in the pacific NW. Technician showed up late in the afternoon and promptly blamed this problem on me because I had image retention at periphery of my screen where icons and toolbar were. I use this TV as a HTPC second plasma old plasma never had a problem that it replaced for over 5 years and that TV explicitly stated not for HTPC usage. This one was touted as specifically for this type of usage. He denied the installation of the screen he had with him due to \"abuse\" clause\" Anyway Long story short 10 phone calls to Samsung, I fought with Samsung, got case escalated and at that point I was denied warrant-ability yet again. Unknown to me at this point I gave up, went to a local TV repair shop who apparently was Samsung authorized and replaced a couple driver boards in TV, which did not fix TV. In the interim Samsung closed there account immediately because they gave them 3 months notice they were going to no longer perform TV repair. Samsung would have none of that and closed their parts account \"immediately\" and they were unable to take in TV for warranty followup. Just know that Samsung is the worst tech company I have \"ever\" dealt with when it comes to warranty or customer service, and if you need it, you may as well just go buy a new TV. Its a shame they have some good products, but you should go into it buying \"as is\" because that is how Samsung will treat it ultimately.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent value for money", "Author": "sdbhoy", "ReviewID": "R30HRH29EZWWR7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had my Samsung 58C6500 up and running for a couple of weeks, got it to watch the world cup and it has been a great experience thus far, great price on Amazon, after months of research and store visits, saw this in Frys, and then went on line and got the best price. Delivery was not an issue, out of the box the stand was attached, managed to do the un-boxing myself and just had my wife help me lift it to the media center, hooked up my U-verse via HDMI, excellent picture quality, internet apps look good, only down side i found was once I hooked up to my A/V receiver and 5.1 speakers, running Pandora on the TV was not coming via my amp, rather the built in speaker on the TV, could not figure out a way to get that output via the amp, not an issue as I picked up the BD-C6500 Blue Ray, which had the apps also and Pandora outputs via my speakers,Prior to hooking up to my amp/speaker I used the inbuilt speaker for a couple of days and was impressed by the audio quality, so if you don't want to add your own speaker the ones built in are good enough, of course you don't get the depth or range with surround sound.another feature I liked that made my decision to buy this was the included stand allows you the swivel the screen based on seating position, had not seen this on some of the other sets I looked at.Overall very please and would recommend to buy this, 58inches of HD glory, and forgot to mention that this unit is only about a 1/4 of an inch deep,", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "A.

I can only tell if its buzzing when its silent at no volume. So if anyone is worried about that, with volume on you can't here a thing, and my room forces me to sit closer to the TV than normal. Its an amazing TV. I've had it for about a month now. Crystal clear picture and its huge! Still tinkering with settings and I will use the previous reviewer's advice. Highly recommended.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture!", "Author": "T. Conrad", "ReviewID": "RHV7FCUSZLXJI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had just bought a Panasonic TV and it died within 2 weeks.  Replacement lasted an hour.  My office mate had 2 Panasonics arrive dead over the holidays.  We were looking for something better (!).  This Samsung is it.  Following is a comparison to the Panasonic.The picture, to me is better than the Panasonic.  And this thing is *huge*.  We have people sitting off to the side and the picture is good from off-axis.This TV can talk back-and-forth with a home studio sound system, but you need to use an optical cable to send the TV sound back (the Panasonic did this just over the HDMI).  This isn't very clear in the manual that it's required.  But once hooked up, the TV will switch to the external sound automatically.  If I switch off the stereo, the TV auto switches to its speakers.Samsung's internet TV looks way more mature.  It has \"apps\" that provide substantially better content offerings than Panasonic.  The Panasonic has the staples - Netflix, Vudu, etc, but with Samsung you can download and configure a *lot* of extra apps (many/most are free).  This is a major plus.  Samsung has a local user account on the TV, and each account maintains its own password to the various sites (like Pandora).  You select the user and that picks the associated login/passwords.The one big negative for Samsung is that it doesn't support a USB keyboard.  WTF?  The Panasonic TV did and if you're planning to do any internet searching, you would definitely appreciate a USB keyboard.  I'm counting on Samsung to address this in some firmware update because this really takes away from the experience, entering letters like texting on a phone!  If you're not searching on Youtube, it probably isn't that big of a deal.  This cost an otherwise great TV one star in my book.The menus are all pretty intuitive.  I actually added a coax splitter to use the cable direct in addition to the digital cable box and it found a *lot* of digital tv channels my cable company box didn't provide.  I only use the cable box for scrambled channels now.  You need to figure out if your cable company uses IRC or HRC channel mode (call them or use trial-and-error).The Samsung allows connection to your PC (!!).  There is a downloadable samsung app for the PC to manage the shares, but it does *not* support a remote USB drive.  However, I found on the net that if you create a junction/link on the PC to the drive, you can make the drive look local and then the Samsung software will see the files.  However, I still never got the TV to see them with this (using Windows Vista 32).  The connections are there, but the TV can't see the files.  My guess is that I have too many of them.  There is another way though, and that's using Windows Media Player DLNA mode (which supports both pushing and pulling file streams) and Samsung supports DLNA.  My understanding is the push technology (send music or video from PC to your TV) is pretty easy so I'm trying that next.  So with this, you're TV becomes a nice remote playback unit!Note that you need to buy a wireless adapter to use internet - or, I just ran the Cat-5 cable.  It's less convenient but guarantees the fastest speeds, and if you're streaming videos, that's what you need.  I never got my home wireless to connect at 802.11n. It's easy to run a long wire in the basement.The TV supports using HDMI information sharing, so if you have HDMI devices connected to it, they all try to \"do the right thing\".  Note that the manuals suggest that you need only Samsung devices, but that's not true.  My Onkyo receiver and Panasonic Blu-ray all respond and interact with the Samsung TV(and the TV displays messages as if it's talking to smart compatible Samsung devices!).  It's just the HDMI format and just make sure all the units have it enabled.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "In love with my new plasma", "Author": "P. Fine", "ReviewID": "RYY64XQBTT0QJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After countless hours of research I opted for the 58C6500 over the 58C550 and could not be happier with my decision. I agonized over this purchase and spent a lot of time on avsforum and other review/info sites. Here is the information that I derived from my research:LCD vs plasma - LCD and especially LED LCD is hot right now. It's thin, bright, feature-rich, and all over the AV shops right now. I was under the impression that plasma was dead! 2 major manufacturers stopped making them and it just seemed like old antiquated technology with high energy usage, short lamp life, and burn-in worries. The supposed \"videophiles\" on the web all seem to agree that plasma still has the better overall picture quality. Deeper blacks, better viewing angles, plus they fixed all the issues experienced by the sets of yesteryear. Lamp life is now 100,000 hours (8 hours/day for 30 years) at which point the brightness would decrease by 50%, energy consumption is way down as these sets exceed energy star standards, they are now as thin as LCDs, and burn-in (image retention-IR) problems have been dealt with. Best of all you can get a huge plasma set for much less than its LCD counterparts. Bang for the buck, plasma is where it's at.So now that I decided in favor of plasma I boiled down the available options and settled on LG, Panasonic, or Samsung. LG's have the big 60\" option by the very glossy screen is a big complaint to most. If you have any natural light in your room then it will be a problem. Ok LG is out. I do want as large a display as possible so that is definitely a concern. The Panny VT25 is by and large considered king of the hill, even with its outdated looks, but the max size is 54\". I have no desire or need for 3D so looking at the Samsung side I can go as big as 58\". Some people have had problems with the Samsungs \"buzzing\" and I watched several youtube videos of these claims. None really seemed that bad to me. That is really the only concern I had with the Samsungs as all other owners report fantastic experiences. I was all but set on the VT25 54\" until it came down to finding someone to buy it from. Bestbuy has them for ~3300+tax, but I am interested only in no tax and free shipping. Amazon does not sell these and the one marketplace seller is not an authorized dealer with a sketchy return policy.Ok looks like it's Samsung for me! Now 550 or 6500? There's a $400 difference but is it worth it? The 6 series is the highest level non 3D plasma that Samsung makes and comes with internet apps, more interfaces, cinema smooth, and digital audio. DLNA is enabled in both which is important to me. I felt that there were enough differences in the 5 and 6 series to justify the additional price bump. Very glad I did because this thing is fantastic. The picture (both SD and HD) is incredible and the default color modes are more than enough to satisfy my needs. The sound is ample and it looks soooo good on my new Horizon N702 TV stand!Amazon shipping was great. I received a call from the freight company to set up the drop off as well as a 1-hour window call. They came to the house, unboxed the TV, moved it to my stand, and powered it on to make sure it was in good working order. Very pleased with the delivery process.My favorite things about the C6500:-This thing is THIN, heavy, but very very thin-Viewing angles are amazing and there is NO discernible glare from the screen whatsoever-Screen mode changes are very simple: 4:3, wide, 16:9, screen fit. Easy, for your non HD channels just put it into wide mode to fill the screen.-Source changes are very intuitive. When I power up the PS3, the 6500 knows not only what it is, but that I would want to use it right away. It auto-moves the source HDMI input to the PS3.-DLNA works great. I can stream high-def movies from my Windows7 or NAS devices and output Dobly 5.1 sound via the optical jack on the 6500. Very cool! I used to use my PS3 for this. Just hit source and it sees all DLNA devices on my network. Folders can be drilled down into on any. Please note that my 6500 is using hard-wired ethernet via powerline adapters, no wifi.-The internet features are nice. PANDORA!! youtube, facebook, hulu... Inputting your usernames and passwords is a massive pain but once that is done this feature works very well. Pandora even bounces around the TV to help prevent image burn.-The musical turn on and turn off sounds are very pleasant. :)-No buzzing", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "AS ADVERTISED", "Author": "Tahoe Blue \"JJ Reno\"", "ReviewID": "R165MMX311SAWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the pn58c6500 for two weeks now. I first had a 52\" Sony LCD that crapped out on me after 2 1/2 years (no warranty). Called Sony for some sort of rebate or help and they refused and couldn't care less about my problem, now there's customer service!After the Sony death, I tried a Vizio 55\" LED/LCD through Amazon. Delivery and service was exceptional. However the Vizio's PQ was outstanding, as long as you sat directly in front of the set. I called Vizio customer support and they were very helpful but could not rectify the problem. I called Amazon and they suggested that I send back the TV before the 30 day expiration window. Again, great customer service from Amazon and the trucking company.So, after two issues with LCD's, I decided to research plasmas and they seemed to fit the bill. Even my repair man for the Sony said go with the plasma and to buy a Samsung....you can't go wrong with inside info!After reading Amazon, CNET and AVSforum, I was convinced about the plasma and especially about Samsung. The only issue I kept reading about was a buzzing problem but that seemed to subside with the newer built models after Oct 2010. Since this was Dec, I figured I was in the clear. The set was a little late on delivery because I ordered it on Black Friday. However, that was the lowest price before and since that date so it was worth the extra 6 days for the delivery.First off the set is beautiful and is a worthy addition to any home. I have it mounted on the wall and it looks like a work of art. Secondly, even though I read about how light (relatively speaking) and thin it is, it still surprised me when they took it out of the box. The set is attached to a lucite/metal stand, which is sturdy and swivels so if you're placing it on a piece of furniture, there is nothing left to do but hook it up.Once I had it mounted on the wall, set up was sort-of easy. The one issue I have with Samsung is that their manual lacks proper English translation and is missing detailed directions. However, their customer support is 24/7 and THEY speak English.Once I had the HDMI and optical cable hooked up to my AV receiver, I was good to go. The Vizio is much easier to set up than the Samsung but I eventually made it through the process. I went with runnning the set for 100 hours (4 days straight) at 50% brightness and contrast in order to break it in. It was driving me crazy because the detail was exceptional but the picture was dark. My patience was soon rewarded.Behold, \"On the fifth day\" I set it to Movie mode with factory settings and was stunned by the color, detail and depth of the picture. The two previous sets had great PQ but nothing compares to the plasma detail on this Sammy. My wife and I sat down to watch Disney's Christmas Carol in 1080p and she, who never comments about any TV unless it sucks, mentioned twice during the movie how incredible the PQ was....now that's coming from a tough critic!I have a calibration DVD and can't wait to see what can be done to make it even better, if that's possible. But after reading AVSforum, I'm pretty sure I can tweak it to be the best it can be.My recommendation is to GET THIS TV, you will not regret it", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "purchase TV", "Author": "Jerry86", "ReviewID": "R3NTRNQ09VMZK3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered the Samaung PN58C6500 through Amazon.

Top quality, shipped in perfect condition, very customizable menus, great interface. It's a no-brainer to go with plasma: you can get a better picture and bigger screen at a lower cost! I also love the swivel-pivot feature. I am using this feature a lot more than I thought I would. I watch a lot of sports, and the plasma picture is just amazing. Everytime I go to a friend's house, I think to myself, wow, my TV really is so much better than EVERYONE else's! I'm glad I did the research!The Bad: None that I can think of. There is some concern about longevity. I've had the TV for about 18 months, and it's just as perfect the first day I turned it on. I'm hoping this will last me a decade. I will update if there are any issues!The Bottom Line: This was my first HDTV purchase. I endlessly and tirelessly researched on AVSForums, reading different reviews, getting input from many sources. After the research, and the advice of the videophiles on the AVSForums, I decided upon Plasma. I don't like the bright, fake feel of the LEDs or LCDs. Then I narrowed it down to Panasonic vs. Samsung. I've heard Panasonic has always made the best plasma TVs, but that Samsung has marched its way into the mix. I felt the Samsung had more modern and better inputs. I decided on this one, and I am absolutely thrilled with my decision.

Norwood", "ReviewID": "R233LY219W75MZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After many weeks of careful research and reading reviews of different products, I made the decision to buy the Samsung plasma.  From what I gathered, plasma still delivers the best image quality for movies, which are my main interest.  I examined many floor samples of LED-LCD sets, which confirmed that opinion.  After a month of operation, the Samsung has not disappointed.  Without a doubt it delivers the best image of any set I have seen and is light years beyond my Hitachi 57\" rear projection, which it replaced.  HD images sparkle with great depth of detail and even the sound is acceptable, actually rather surprising considering the speaker compromises necessary in such a thin footprint.  If I had to mention a negative trait, it would be the presence of reflections off the glass.  However, this is a common characteristic of plasma screens, and Samsung has addressed it through filtering that helps to reduce the effect.  Another nit to pick is the lack of an S-video input.  Although most modern devices use HDMI, one may still have  an older DVD player or VHS without HDMI outputs.  As overall plasma technology has improved, the concerns of image retention and power consumption seem to be a thing of the past.  This, coupled with the current modest prices for plasma sets, seem to make this a better choice than LED sets, at least for me.  If you are shopping for a large flat screen, I can enthusiastically recommend the Samsung PN58C6500.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung PN58C6500 58-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV (Black)", "Author": "Mark1City", "ReviewID": "R1S02F6N83O1EQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose plasma vs. LED due to discussion comments about size and the 600 refresh rate, plus I wanted the Internet apps.

The picture and colors are brilliant from all viewing angles, even close up.I got the Samsung LAN adapter to connect to my wireless router - works great.  I also got a Samsung Theater system, the lower-priced of two with the wireless rear speakers. I wanted to avoid hard wiring for both due limited attic access. This theater system works great, too, for what I wanted to spend and keep it simple; the main amplifier/receiver contains a Blu-Ray player, an FM radio tuner (bonus since I could not find it part of the description), sound effects, and more Internet apps (which uses the LAN adapter plugged into the TV).  With two HDMI cable connections - cable box to amplifier/receiver (In) then out) to TV - the two handshake and work great (once you figure out the fair documentation that comes with the theater system).Highly recommend all three items!", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this amazing TV! Can we still call it a TV???", "Author": "Snidely Whiplash", "ReviewID": "R3EN2GLOZP347W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this amazing viewing experience (just calling it a TV doesn't do it justice) for a couple of days now.  I am completely impressed and satisfied with pretty much all aspects of this set.  The Picture is exactly what I expected. AWESOME, Lifelike, Vibrant, stunning and a host of other adjectives that don't do this amazing beauty justice.  I had no trouble with the setup or initial operation and the WiFi connection setup was a breeze.  To my surprise the AnyNet feature reached right out to my Sony BDV-E570 Blu-Ray Player/Surround sound system automatically.  The TV switches automatically to the player when a disk inserted.  Who would've thunk it.  I have DLNA setup in my home and the TV had no trouble accessing the content unlike my Sony. HA!  However, The TV like the Sony has trouble playing videos. Essentially no Codec = No Video.  I'm thinking its more of a DRM issue that will take a bunch of lawyers to figure out.  Oh well someday maybe.So now for my only Complaint...  Sound Quality!  I know all manufactures expect us silly Consumers to buy their new fancy \"Sound Bars\" but come on...  I just forked over close to two grand and the default sound is simply awful.  No bass, very \"tinny\" ultra ultra highs make this set very uncomfortable to listen to.  In our setup we only use surround for movies so TV sound quality is important. So here is the big gotcha with this.  My last Plasma (Vizio 42\") had the same problem. So I purchased a medium grade Logitech computer speaker w/ Subwoofer setup and problem solved right??? With the Vizio it was! With my new fancy Plasma.... Not so much! Unfortunately you cannot control the sound level of the External Speakers with this two thousand dollar TV.  It's like Samsung mocks us by putting a nice headphone jack right on the side of the TV that can't be used for this application.  So in the end we've settled for my custom \"AM Radio\" settings on the joke of an equalizer Samsun provides under setup.My only other annoyance is they promote this as a \"Smart TV\" with awesome Internet Apps. And it is very cool to say the least.  But again, for two grand you'd think Samsung would include a QWERTY Keyboard Remote with the TV for no extra cost. I'm not asking for the ultra high end fancy pantsy 3\" color touch screen Remote Control.  I just want a standard one. Having said this, I saw on CNET today that Samsung will sell me what I want (Samsung Flip QWERTY Remote) for only $99 starting in April.  How did they know I needed one??? Hmmmmm :0) Who knows... maybe they will send me one for writing this review. HA!All in all I am thoroughly happy and impressed with the TV, Samsung, Plasma vs LCD-LED, Features and pretty much everything else involving this TV.  Again, calling it a TV just doesn't do it justice.Thank you Samsung for knowing what I wanted. We are not into the whole 3d thing. That is what Movie Theaters are for.
