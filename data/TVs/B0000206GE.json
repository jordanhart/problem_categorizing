{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Alternative to Large CRT Screen", "Author": "TT", "ReviewID": "R3O7R39EWT76O2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While shopping for a large screen television, I had considered the 32\" and 36\" Sony WEGAs.  However, this 43\" Sony projection TV had key advantages over the CRT WEGAs.KP-43 Advantages: Thinner  (shallower depth) than the 36\" WEGA; Lighter (about 100 lbs) than the  36\" WEGA; and Larger screen viewing area (43\" vs 36\").CRT  Advantages: Wider viewing angle (both vertical and horizontal); and Shorter  minimum viewing distance.Although the KP-43 projection TV has a larger  screen, it is lighter and can be moved more easily.  It also is a good  choice for apartments or other smaller living spaces.If picture quality  is critical to you, then you should be aware that you may lose detail in  the shadows since the black levels do not seem to be reproduced as  consistently or accurately as a professional monitors.  To calibrate  your TV for your viewing environment, I recommend renting the \"Video  Essentials\" DVD.  In general, you may need to decrease the PICTURE  (contrast), BRIGHTNESS, and SHARPNESS settings to achieve the best picture  quality.  With the factory settings, you may notice blooming and additional  noise.  You may also notice all the noise from traditional cable and  broadcast signals.  Therefore, you may wish to subscribe to digital  services.  There is a single component video input on the TV, which may not  be enough if you have digital cable and a DVD player.  You may need a  separate component video switcher to accommodate multiple component video  sources, or you could sacrifice some picture quality and use S-Video  connections instead.", "Date": "December 15, 1999"}, {"Title": "Excellent Choice", "Author": "Naim Hasan (naimh@mtrx.com)", "ReviewID": "R3RCUYE8QSS9LZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was recently in the market for a larger screen TV set.  The 32 to 36 screen was going to be the perfect size given my family room deminsions. I was considering the Sony WEGA XBR, Toshiba, and Misubishi. Then one day as  I walked through one of the retail stores in my area, I saw the Sony 43'  Rear Projection Set.  The compact size, the Larger Viewing Screen, Picture  Quality, Enhance Digital Features and The Price, were very impressive.  My  search was over.  It's been a week since the TV was delivered to my home  and I can truly say that it has been a wonderful experience.There are a  couple of things to be aware of:  * Getting all the components connected  can take a little time.* Limited space in the Stand for adding  components.Overall I think Sony 43' is a great investment if your  considering 32 to 36\" TV's. You'll get excellent picture quality at a  better price point.", "Date": "March 14, 2000"}, {"Title": "This is a winner !!!", "Author": "markg@ujft.org (markg@ujft.org)", "ReviewID": "ROAGZA014O5RE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WoW!  That's what I said when I saw them uncrating this TV on the retail floor.  I had completed my purchase for a high end 36\" tube tv.  I  went home that evening and called the salesperson to cancel the delivery.  I went back to the store the next day and purchased this hot new Sony  43\" projection tv.  It is far less deep, weighs less, and is even  .5\" less wide than the 36\" t.v.  The sound is great.  The picture  is great, and it even has a pretty wide viewing angle.", "Date": "November 1, 1999"}, {"Title": "Projection TVs have come a long way...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3J6C88FIGLHNP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this TV about three weeks ago and it has exceeded my expectations.  The picture is crystal clear and it can be viewed easily from many extreme angles.  In terms of home theater, this model even comes  with component video jacks in addition to the composite and s-video  hookups. If your considering buying the 36\" Wega or any other big  screen tube TV, take a look at this model and you'll see comparable picture  quality and a lot more screen for the same money and it about 100 pound  lighter.  If you're in the market, this one is a winner.", "Date": "October 22, 1999"}, {"Title": "Studio dwellers - there is hope!", "Author": "\"vachicago\"", "ReviewID": "R1GCR9R88GZDTZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a GREAT TV!  The picture (depending on source) is phenomenal.  The size (video picture and physical object) does not overwhelm you.  The TV can be viewed comfortably without being on a TV stand.  The design of  the TV & remote is excellent.  I had an opportunity to view this model  in a store, and my eyes were drawn to its picture quality (and I had to  remind myself of its physical size).This TV fits well in a room size  13x13.  It can be viewed comfortably even sitting a couple of feet from it.  There are five picture modes, 2 of which can be programmed to the viewer's  preference.  Because of its size, widescreen movies are enjoyable (before,  when choosing a video as either VHS or DVD, I would pick VHS if the DVD was  in widescreen format).  There are 4 video displays, three of which can be  programmed to accept 8 different components.Sony has included a lot of  programming choices in this model.  Connecting a receiver, VCR and DVD (and  getting them to work) took about 4 hours.  The TV needs to be off when  connecting a component.  Each component should be added one at a time,  rather than plugging & connecting everything at once and then turning  the TV on.  Apparently the TV needs to 'read' each component before it's  recognized.  The manual was somewhat confusing (because there are usually 2  to 4 combinations to use), but after a component was added you just follow  from the previous example for additional components.  P.S.:  the more  components you add, the more every cable & power cord needs to be  labeled.The remote is comfortable to handle.  There are problem with it  though: 1) in order to use a component, more than just one button needs to  be pressed; 2) you still need to use the remote that came with the  component.This can easily replace a 27-inch to 36-inch TV.  It weights  ~150 pounds and the footprint is small (20 D x 37 W x 42 H).  As the source  of the picture increases in quality, especially from the local TV stations,  this model will be enjoyed more and more.  Then a viewer will have a true  movie experience at home.I chose this TV based on: 1) picture quality;  2) video size & physical size; 3) design; 4) price [remember what you  paid for your current computer? It will outlast it! ] If you can find a  vendor, buy it!  Do not wait!  It will be the best investment!", "Date": "December 14, 1999"}, {"Title": "A good TV for small rooms", "Author": "Richard J Kelly", "ReviewID": "RY52X7FDHB3K9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased my TV about a week ago.  The picture quality is very good, most people think it is a direct TV not projection. The built in screen protector gives the picture more clarity.  And the TV definently  benefits from a digital source such as satellite tv.  Hooking it up is  somewhat confusing if you have a number of components.  For the money I  don't think you could find a TV of this size with better picture quality.  My only complaint is not with the TV, but with the optional matching stand.  The stand is pretty much useless if you have more than two components.  You cannot put two components side by side because the stand is not wide  enough.  And even after removing the shelf, it is not tall enough to stack  components on top of each other.  The stand needs to be about 3\"  taller and 4\" wider.  Sony's designers obvivously did not put a lot of  thought into the stand when it comes to function.", "Date": "January 22, 2000"}, {"Title": "good quality- fair price", "Author": "Thomas Lenart", "ReviewID": "R3B8UXE902CA2I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony 43in. projection TV is a good unit to look at. It does seem hard to get, as most TV stores and retailers are out of stock. The picture is sharp, clear and almost at times real. However the picture does seem  sensitive to noise (lines, snow). But for watching a DVD or video  presentation I cannot think of another set I have seen as that is as good.  The set is in a nice, compact case, and the cabinet (extra, fits under the  TV) available has room for a DVD, VCR, Tuner, and Cable Box, making all of  those components fit in a neat presentation, without, wires and boxes  hanging off the set.
