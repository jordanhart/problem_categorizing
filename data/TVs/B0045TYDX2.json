{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Review You Were Looking For", "Author": "Andrew S. Tafoya \"raab_it\"", "ReviewID": "R26L8I6UKJTUH2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a weird purchase for me, coming from being a SONY & Samsung Fanboy. This is the most outstanding 2D picture I have ever laid my eyes on, and I have seen many High-end Television sets. I almost bought a Sony XBR-HX909 for the super high reviews on its amazing 2D image. But once I saw the 3D image I was a bit thrown off by the 3D technology, after already owning a Panasonic 3D Viera which was much better. So this is what I have gathered from my total experience with the Vizio 3D HDTV:-PROS-+The purchased place with Amazon was better than I thought it would have been. Easy, Fast, Free Shipping, NO TAX (Tax is around $115 if you buy from a store), and perfectly cared for; Sam's Club is scary, lol.+47 inches of \"OMG! It is bigger than I thought.\" This set gives so much at this price, quality, and Size!!!+The LED television is thicker, due to the 160 LEDs being directly behind the screen. This makes for better contrast that will blow your mind away!!! I have never seen this kind of true black on a set ever before. Sony sells this technology for around $3,500; yikes!+Features, Features, Features!!! The WiFi works amazingly. The Netflix app play videos at a higher resolution than my PS3 or computer using HDMI. The WebTV programs are limited but they are great, like Revision3. There is Vudu rental, Amazon Steaming, and of course Netflix. There is Pandora and a radio app for local radio station; or any state you want.+The best built-in speakers! The sound is out outrageous, there is simply no thin TV that can house speaker like the ones on this set. I was going to buy a 5.1 Dolby system for the room, but I only turn the volume up 20% on the Vizio. I recommend to turn Truevolume off, if causes weird volume changes. This feature is on most Televisions with different names, but always cause volume issues; much like ipod's volume settings.+The remote is bluetooth and an amazing little device. All remotes should be like this one!!! It is universal, and automatically has the codes in the television for all devices but the PS3; due to the PS3 syncing. But the XBOX 360 is compatible! TIVO, DirectTV, etc. The keyboard is great for the apps and Facebook! Since it is bluetooth, like the PS3 Blu-ray remote, the signal is always connected, so the buttons are harder to press so you don't accidentally change channels. This is a good thing.+Bluetooth means wireless headphones so you don't bother others who don't want to hear the TV; like my girlfriend when she is sleeping. You can buy Vizio's headsets, or any bluetooth headset you may have will work as well.+The accessories like the Vizio Router, Bluetooth Headset, or Vizio Stereo equipment are made easy and for a great price (high ratings from CNET). The 3D Glasses are sold seperately, but only cost around $150 for two rechargeable glasses. That is about the price that SONY or Samsung sells for one Pair!!! Very Cheap for 3D!!! 2 SONY pairs will buy you 4 Vizio pairs. A lot of the other 3D TVs come with one pair, or no glasses at all.+The Price is dead on with AWESOME!!! It is robbery!!! I payed $1500, and chose Amazon after the tax factor of buying in a store. The 480hz (really 240hz) makes 2D images amazing, and not look fake at all! Remember to turn this feature all the way to high, because it is turned off out-of-the-box.Okay, well here is the BAD:CONS-There is no SD slot, but this is not a problem really. There is 3 USB ports! 3!!! I never used the SD slot on my Panasonic, it is kind of useless.-The 3D is not like my Plasma 3D. BUT!!! The Plasma does great 3D, but not a great 2D image. 3D is a fun factor, don't take it seriously and you will be fine. The ghosting issue is present, but it is present on every 3D set I have seen but the Panasonic 3D Plasmas. The 3D can be down right horrible on the PS3 video games at times, but does okay on the movies. Remember that 3D is not a every moment thing on this set. It is used rarely and on all 3D pictures you can turn it off to 2D. I personally like the 3D and the glasses, but don't think that there will be any set better than this, other than the Plasmas. The real focus should be that the TVs 480hz (really 240hz) is used for better 3d, but really make the biggest difference on the 2D image; which is amazing!-Size, is a bit thicker, but it is because it has to be in order to produce the images at the 10,000,000:1 Contrast. I think the set is beautiful, and my friends freak out how beautiful it is in person! So Size is nothing but a few inches difference. You should really not worry about size though, you can't see how thick the TV is, but you can tell the Image difference.IN THE ENDThis Television out preforms all the Television set I have seen, even the Samsung 8000 series. It has so many features, you will feel that you just robbed Vizio of their money about $1000. The 3D is okay, but you shouldn't worry; no one will have a TV even close in quality to this one! The accessories are great, with amazing prices. You will ultimately feel that you are leagues ahead of any other TV. The black are literally black (the led turn off), the whites are bright as all hell, the color are beyond anything you know! You cannot go wrong with this purchase. I hate to say it, but Vizio converted me away from the other brands (Sony, Samsung, etc.). The Reviews from CNET are endlessly great too! This should be the happiest purchase on a Television set you will ever have. Good luck, and feel free to post extra question, I will answer back :)", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "EARLY REVIEW", "Author": "David T. Fischer", "ReviewID": "RS4LOQDD1D8O2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV and I'm still in the process of doing everything with it, but I'm here to give an honest first impression. I'm actually using my computer connected to this TV to write this review and let me say that in my tiny bedroom this TV is massive. It looks great with my computer connected via RGB and there is little to no lag. I just watched KROQ's Almost Acoustic Christmas on the TV last night and the stream looked pretty good for what it was. The 2D picture is fantastic on this product and both my PS3 and Xbox 360 look amazing on it. The 3D needs work and I knew that coming into this TV. There is some ghosting of the image when watching 3D, but it does it's job well enough. You will definitely notice ghosting on anything other than Blu-ray 3D and titles in general. I'm not happy about it, but what can you do? I'm not using a certified 3D HDMI cable, so maybe that's an issue? I know it's a high speed HDMI cable, so it should be good enough. I did just order an Amazon High Speed 3D supported cable though to see if there is a difference. I'll update this review with my findings. I'd say the 3D is not a must for this TV, but is a cool extra. I watched a 3D Hockey game last night that was broadcast on Xfinity 3D in my area. It was pretty cool, but the ghosting is plentiful. If you don't know what I mean by ghosting, well I mean that you can see a shadow of the image behind the 3D image and it makes everything a bit blurry. The score graphic on the Hockey game looked horrible as do the static titles in most 3D cases. I would not recommend buying the 3D GLASSES, WHICH HAVE TO BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY. I bought mine at Sam's Club for about $160 and I was happy for that price. I still would caution anyone expecting perfect 3Dm which is a let down when you don't feel it's perfect after spending so much money. Vizio should really bundle at least one pair of 3d glasses, especially since the technology is not up to snuff. I tried some of the Vizio Internet Apps and the Yahoo Weather is cool, so is the Amzon Video(Thanks for the $5 video credit!) Netflix seems to work, but it as SUPER SLOW for me through wireless connection and my bars are almost full. I thought the TV froze it was so slow. Maybe being connected with Ethernet directly would change this. Anyway, here are some pros and cons, if you have any questions email me at: Doofus88@gmail.comPROS:-Great 2D picture-3D option is nice-Works well with connected computers, PS3, and Xbox 360.-Sound is pretty good, mind you I'm in a tiny room.-Internet Apps are nice, but Netflix seemed slow over wireless.CONS:-3D technology not good enough for the high price tag.-Expensive 3D glasses that are NOT INCLUDED.SIDE COMMENT:I also want to comment that Amazon uses Pilot for shipping and they really suck. DON'T EXPECT YOUR TV TO BE DELIVERED ON THE DAY YOU SCHEDULE ON AMAZON. I got mine Saturday and it was supposed to be delivered Thursday. Pilot's costumer service was rude and the delivery man did not handle my TV with care. I just wanted everyone who orders to know that.VIZIO 47-Inch Class Full HD 3D Full Array TruLED with Smart Dimming LCD HDTV 480 Hz SPS with VIZIO Internet AppsUPDATE: 12-18-10Just a few updates for my review here. One thing I did is add attributes for different aspects of this TV.3D UPDATEI got the new Amazon HDMI cable that supports 3D and is highspeed and the 3D effect is still the same. I think it works the best on Blu-Ray 3D movies. A Christmas Carol looks great and The Polar Express look really good. There still is some ghosting issues with them, although they have the least of it. I also have a PS3 and played Wipeout HD in 3D, which was ok, but still had lots of ghosting. Pacific Rift really did not look good at all in 3D though, lots of ghosting. I'm curious if it's just that those games were converted and I'll have to wait to get a game made for 3D to really get a great 3D game experience.SOUNDWhen I was watching a Blu-ray on my PS3 I noticed some popping randomly during the movie. There are small, but still noticeable. I contacted Vizio and asked them what the best set up for sound through the TV would be. Their online chat is really helpful, really good service, and they told me what exactly to do. I think I still notice it sometimes, but overall I think it's gone. I will update more on this since this could be a potential problem. I think I should be able to use all the settings on for this TV. My settings for anyone if they want to know are...Both SRS settings off.PCM for digital output.Audio mode: FlatPictureJust a small thing to nit pick about. I noticed on my Blu-Rays that they sometimes look grainy. I know it's not the TV though because all my games look perfect and no grain anywhere. I think that due to the size of the TV and now close I am, I just notice the small details of the digital transfer more. Or if the movie was shot on film, I notice the grain more. Maybe I'm wrong, but I just wanted to point that out.I hope my updates help everyone.****UPDATE 2: January 31st, 2011****Just a reminder to people who read my review to read the comments on my post to see if I answer any more of your questions while talking with other people. I do also want to state I contacted Amazon once and had the TV exchanged for a new one of the same model because I was unhappy with the \"backlight bleed\" I was experiencing. My current TV does not have any bleed, just to update. I think it's a serious problem though, so watch out if you get this TV and see that there is a brighter spot somewhere when there is a black screen.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing 2D, broken 3D.", "Author": "J. Puckett", "ReviewID": "R2877IDS1GWOP8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been in the market for a new TV for about a year now and have been waiting patiently for a decently priced LED LCD as well as 3D.  This 47\" Vizio seemed to finally hit the price point and size that I was looking for, so I jumped on a pre-Super Bowl sale from a nationwide wholesaler.  I picked up the TV along with a pair of the Vizio-branded 3D glasses.A quick note before going into my review.  My TV came with firmware version VIZIO_XP1.21.2.1.I'll start out by saying that the 2D picture is absolutely amazing.  The blacks are black and colors are vibrant.  The TV almost doesn't need any calibration coming out of the box for those who like to tweak the picture.  For those who never know any better, they should be very happy from the get-go.  Thanks to the local dimming, I can see no issues of backlight bleeding/clouding/flashlighting on my set.  Also due to the 160 local dimming zones, I've seen no hint of blooming on my set from my normal viewing distance of about 8'.  The TV just absolutely shines with well-mastered blu-ray movies.  So far I've tested Avatar and The Hangover, and both simply blow my mind with the quality present.  I upgraded from a 4-year old 60hz 1080p LCD and watching blu-ray movies on this new Vizio is like experiencing HD all over again.  I promise you this is not hyperbole, I'm that amazed by the clarity of the picture when being fed top-notch, non-compressed signals.The remote feels a bit cheap but gets the job done.  The slide-out keyboard is very nice for the Vizio Internet Apps (VIA) feature and works as expected.  The buttons are a bit stiff though and the remote itself feels like it's prone to breakage at some point in the future.The motion interpolation control in this TV seems to be well done, frame transitions are very smooth and, from what I can tell, introduce no artifacts or juddering.  You can turn the motion control completely off if you don't like the \"soap opera effect\", as it's called.  There are 4 settings for the motion control, \"Off\", \"Low\", \"Medium\", and \"High\".  Changing between \"Off\" and \"Low\" produces the obvious intended effect, but I'm so far unable to perceive a difference between \"Low\", \"Medium\", and \"High\".The Vizio Internet Apps are merely OK to me, as I already have a lot of this functionality available to me through my Playstation 3 or XBOX 360.  There currently is no Youtube or Hulu support on VIA with the 3D versions of these TVs, which is a bummer.  I would expect them to be added in a future firmware update though, since the 2D-only XVT line has them.  The Netflix app worked OK, no issues here.  For the curious, it appears to use the interface of the old PS3 disc-based Netflix app, which is sufficient but not the best out of the many UI iterations Netflix has come up with over various devices.  The Facebook app seemed highly useless to me, as it seemed to require too much navigation to view the stuff I wanted.  The Twitter app actually seemed quite useful and shows the latest followed tweet directly in the \"tile\" when bringing up the VIA interface...a nice touch.  The weather app serves its purpose well and the VUDU app was actually put together nicely, although it still pales in comparison to the slick PS3 VUDU app.  It does fare better in a head-to-head comparison than does the Netflix app, though.  I haven't tried any of the other apps installed.  All-in-all, I think the addition of VIA is a nice feature-add to the TV but not a selling point.On to the 3D, which was the second-most feature I was looking forward to on this model.  After giving it a fairly thorough testing across different types of media, I think it's just plain broken.  The crosstalk/ghosting is very bad through almost all content I tried, rarely looking great enough that I would consider it \"watchable\".  The problem seems to be with high-contrast screens, which includes almost everything you're going to watch unfortunately.  I'm somewhat leaning towards the Vizio glasses being the problem, as I'm not convinced they are opaque enough when closed, but the issue could lie in any number of places.  I'm tempted to be silly and try using them along with some sunglasses to see if that helps block out any extra unwanted light from each eye, but even if it did help, that's obviously not an acceptable work-around.I've tried various 3D-enabled games, the n3D channel on DirecTV, and the free 3D demos available on VUDU.  The only times I've watched something and had all forms of crosstalk disappear is with Super Stardust HD, some scenes in the Toy Story 3 trailer, and almost all of the Jim Carrey animated Christmas movie trailer (mainly due to it being mostly dark).  Everything else has been bad enough to where I consider it completely unwatchable.I had thought to try adjusting picture settings while displaying 3D content to see if I could minimize or eliminate some of the crosstalk, but Vizio locks you out of virtually ALL picture settings while in 3D mode.  You only have access to color temperature and maybe one other setting, neither of which did anything to hamper the crosstalk.*** UPDATE ***  The following paragraph is from my original review.  However, the recent firmware update to this TV has fixed the issue.  I can now watch ESPN3D in all its glory.Another note on this model for those with DirecTV, there is a known problem with the ESPN 3D channel not working.  Vizio users who attempt to access the ESPN 3D channel are greeted with a message stating that your TV does not support 720p in 3D and are unable to view.  The problem almost definitely lies with the DirecTV hardware, but as of this posting, I'm not sure they acknowledged it.  Vizio is not an officially supported manufacturer with DirecTV 3D, so they aren't currently required to help you to get it working.  Be warned of this.*** END UPDATE ***Overall, I absolutely love the 2D, but the 3D is pretty much busted.  I've only had the TV for a couple of days, but I'm considering about taking it back and getting a refund.  I have 90 days to make a decision, so I do plan on calling/emailing Vizio to see if the crosstalk issue can be resolved by new glasses or a firmware update.  I gave my review 3 stars to split it's strengths and weaknesses down the middle.  3D is the big feature of this model and it just doesn't work as it should.  If I can somehow get most of the 3D issues resolved, I'll change the review to 5 stars in a heartbeat.Simply put, if you want to use the 3D on this set, I wouldn't consider it.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful TV - can't beat the quality at this price!", "Author": "K. Brantley", "ReviewID": "R10OWJ1TZBLLBQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'll try and keep this brief and highlight some of the very best and very worst things about this set. I'm reviewing the XVT3D474SV.First of all, if you're considering this vs. the 42 inch, realize that they are NOT the same TV. The 42 inch does not have the back lighting like the 47 inch does. The 47 and 55 inch Vizio units are both in the higher tier.PROS:-BEAUTIFUL 2D picture. Great color contrast. Remarkable blacks for an LED unit. White and colors are obviously good. Excellent sharpness, 480hz refresh rate, etc. You won't find a similar or better picture for anything less than $2,000. Animated films at 1080p look absolutely incredible - jaw dropping.-Above average sound for a LED TV. Speakers also face forward. However, with a picture this nice, you should invest in surround sound.-Vizio Apps are fun. Ability to stream Netflix is neat, and Vudu works great if you have a fast connection. Streaming 1080p movies for a few bucks a pop with their HDX looks GREAT.-Qwerty remote is pretty solid, does the job.-TV looks great out of the box. Calibration is extremely easy for some minor tweaks.-Back lit TV with smart dimming - better than other purely edge-lit LEDs in the same $800-1,400 price range.-This TV was $1,398 at Sam's Club as of March 2011. Might be worth shopping around for the best price.-TV has a game mode (but read below, it doesn't make a huge difference because there is still some input lag). TV looks GREAT with Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.-I don't have any issues with light bleed/flash lighting, ghosting, halo effects, etc. From an angle with a completely dark screen, you might notice your black fading to grey a little, but this wouldn't be your normal viewing angle. You also notice some when you turn on the TV right when it starts up, but I've heard the smart dimming does not cut on until the set actually gets beyond the initial start-up screen.CONS:-I have not tried the 3D on this TV and hear it isn't the greatest. However, I don't know that there are many TVs that do great 3D (plasmas are the best) and there still isn't a lot of content in 3D. I bought this TV for the great 2D picture. The features on this TV that help produce a 3D image (480hz, etc.) also do wonders for the 2D mentioned earlier.-DirecTV remote has trouble syncing with this TV and most Vizio TVs. Not a huge deal, just cut them on one at a time.-Screen is not 100% matte, so there is a tiny bit of glare. However, it isn't as pronounced as with some other brands. The frame itself is also a little more clunky than a lot of stuff that is coming out this year, and the TV is thicker than most LEDs (because of the back lighting). I'd consider this a non-issue unless you really care about having a picture frame TV hung on the wall.-Input lag - almost all LEDs will have some input lag. As compared to my older Panasonic Plasma (which had no input lag), I notice a tiny bit of lag with games like Black Ops. However, it's still completely playable and shouldn't really affect your gaming. I'm very picky and really notice this stuff so I don't think this should be an issue for 99% of gamers.Overall, I'd give this TV a 4.5 out of 5. If they removed the input lag and got a slightly sleeker frame/base, then I think this TV would be a 5 for me. Don't buy this TV for the 3D, buy it for the BEST 2d picture you can find for under $2,000. GREAT TV.FYI, I bought a 50 inch Samsung UN50C8000 Plasma, which had some great reviews. Did not find the colors to be very good, pictures did not pop, sound was terrible. Blacks weren't black, white's were dull. Exchanged the Samsung and got the Vizio. True TV love.UPDATE: June 7, 2011TV is still going strong, picture still looking great. I've done plenty of gaming on the XBOX 360 and PS3, and the input lag I mentioned earlier in the post is no longer an issue - I guess I quickly adjusted. Still haven't tried 3D. No regrets about the purchase and would still recommend this set. Never see any light bleed common on some other cheaper LED sets.UPDATE: August 9, 2011Still loving this TV. I have to say, the price has come down considerably on Amazon and also at Sam's Club. I have watched a large number of blu-rays recently, and have to say that they are simply wonderful on the TV. Still no issues or malfunctions.UPDATE: July 9, 2012Might as well provide another update, huh? I still think this TV is just wonderful and can compete with any $1,500 or less 2d picture. The TV has mysteriously turned itself off 2-3 times over the last year, but I turned it back on. I guess there isn't a real problem there? Who knows. Not a big deal for now. There are definitely better 3d products on the market now, in summer of 2012. Still love the TV, no buyer's remorse here.UPDATE: August 13, 2012The Vizio died on me. Still investigating repair options, but regardless of the outcome I am 100% not happy about the TV giving out after 1.5 years of use. The warranty expired several months ago and Vizio Support has no obligation or interest in doing anything to help me out here. Overall, I guess I should have bought the extended warranty. I've lowered the review on this TV to 2 stars because of my new perception of low quality. Why even give it the 2nd star? Well, it was a great TV while it lasted, and I guess I wouldn't be out a TV or $ to fix it had I purchased some extended warranty.UPDATE: September 7, 2012Got the TV fixed a few weeks ago. It's working now and at this point I'm just praying that it doesn't quit on me again over the next 1-2 years. Everything back to normal, cost to fix was $299. Any more and I probably would have just purchased a new TV. So, once again, I've got a great TV that I also consider a ticking time bomb due to lack of quality internal construction. When I buy my next TV, it won't be a Vizio, regardless of how pretty the picture is.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV!", "Author": "C. Brouillette", "ReviewID": "R2QD357WY0PY1G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this TV about a week and a half ago and so far I absolutely love it! The picture quality is AMAZING!! It is very crisp and clear and real looking! The TV itself is beautiful and sleek. We have had no issues with the TV turning itself off or on, everything has worked almost perfectly.The only problem I've experienced with it happened about a day after coming out of the box, the picture on the screen would flash off for a half second about every 10-20 seconds. The TV itself didn't turn off and the sound would still play, it was just the picture on the screen that would flash off and on. And it would do it no matter what we were playing on the TV: cable, PS3, or DVD player. We purchased the TV from Sam's Club so I called their tech support first as I've heard Vizio's can be a little aggravating. We first tried a power reset of the TV, unplugging it and holding down the power button for 30 seconds, but the problem persisted. Then we restored everything to factory settings, as if we had just taken it out of the box. Since we hadn't had the TV long we didn't lose many settings and the problem seems to have gone away. It's been about a week and everything has been great since! There's no telling why that happened, they said that TV's these days are more like computers and sometimes they just glitch and need to be reset. This is why I took away a star.The internet apps work perfectly and set up was fast and easy, both times. I could even figure out the wiring even though I have NO experience in that. The remote is simple to use, though it does look a little cheap. I personally haven't had any issues with the QWERTY keypad, as some have mentioned it's a little awkward, but I have skinny fingers. It synched  perfectly with my cable box and audio receiver, I didn't have to look up any codes it already had them.There is no glare on the screen and we have a living room full of windows. I am also a gamer and I can tell you I am ASTOUNDED at how great the PS3 looks on this TV!I haven't tried out the 3D but I really didn't buy it for that. This TV had the best reviews I could find anywhere for 2D picture and overall quality and I was willing to spend the extra money for a television I knew would look great and last me.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better TV than I expected after reading other's concerns", "Author": "P T Barnum lives on", "ReviewID": "RCQJA2JQFE3U8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS:-- TV Picture is really excellent-- Vizio Apps seem well thought out-- Netflix streaming picture quality is astonishingly good-- Vizio's customer support is outstanding-- Surprisingly good sound from internal speakers-- Amazon price was excellent-- toggle \"wheel\" function on remote is excellent and slide out keyboard is a bonusCONS:-- Some initial issues required resetting TV-- Screen has a moderately high amount of reflection-- transport buttons on remote (pause, play, stop, FF, RW, etc.) are way too small-- remote not lit at all, bring a flashlight-- would not wirelessly connect with my Cisco M-20 Valet Plus routerMy Setup: I bought this along with an Onkyo TX-NR809 A/V receiver so the only cable (currently) connected to my Vizio TV is an HDMI cable from my receiver.  It looks as if I will need to connect an RCA (or other audio) cable from the TV back to my receiver to enable sound from the apps (like Netflix) to run through my receiver and external speakers.The TV seemed to work fine out of the box, but I bypassed the initial setup as I wanted to temporarily hook it up directly to my cable box to ensure the TV worked okay.  When I re-wired everything through my new receiver, the TV malfunctioned repeatedly by shutting down after about 10 seconds (picture came on, froze, then TV shut off).  I had read one other review about this problem and feared that my TV was doomed, but a call to Vizio (a live tech answered within about 15 seconds!) walked me through the reset process and the TV has since worked fine.My biggest, unresolved (though bypassed) problem was that I couldn't get the Vizio TV to connect with my Cisco M-20 Valet Plus wireless router in order to access the Internet apps (like Netflix).  Vizio tech support couldn't find a solution and suggested I re-work the passcode/security settings on my router and all my wireless devices, but I felt that was an unreasonable option considering all other devices I own connect without a problem.  What I did, instead, was hook up a Netgear WiFi Range Extender (WN3000RP) which I had recently purchased because my wireless signal where my TV is located was on the weak side, anyway.  This Netgear range extender just happens to have a Ethernet port outlet so I connected the out from the Netgear extender to the Ethernet input on my Vizio -- creating a suitable workaround (and making it a \"wired\" connection instead of wireless).  The Netgear Extender also gives me a 5-bar signal strength where, previously, I only had a 3-bar signal.  I still believe the wireless connection problem originates with the Vizio, but others haven't mentioned it so I'm guessing it is either that my specific router doesn't play well with Vizio's software or there's something odd about my security code which the Vizio software doesn't like.The picture is quite amazing (I don't even have a HD source hooked up, but my receiver upscales all video to the Vizio which, itself, has similar upscaling software that my receiver bypasses) on DVD's and on Netflix streaming.  The only issues I have noticed so far are some dashed lines at the top of some channels which can be fixed in the Video Settings tab by adjusting the default screen from \"Standard\" to \"Wide\" which, I believe, creates a very slight -- but unnoticeable -- overscan.  The other thing I noticed was that some movies had a subtle \"surreal and unnatural\" look to them and an Internet search alerted me to the fact that most LED HDTV's have software that interpolates the motion giving movies what is often called a \"soap opera effect\".  I was able to eliminate that after going into the Video settings and changing the \"Smooth Motion\" settings to \"Off\" or to \"Low\" (default is Medium).  Note that the TV settings are not universal when you change them, but separate for each input source (which makes sense if you think about it as you don't want to have to keep changing the setting every time you switch from Netflix, to DVD, to game, to cable, etc.).This is still quite new and I'm still getting used to it, but I wanted to share this information in an attempt to help others who run into similar issues or are concerned about some of the critical reviews referencing the issues I mentioned.For additional peace of mind, remember to pay with a credit card that doubles the manufacturer's warranty and you'll be covered for two years instead of the manufacturer's one-year warranty.I will try to update with any other issues or discoveries I make -- but so far, I'm REALLY, REALLY happy with this purchase.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, great specs, awesome price", "Author": "Cocky_Balboa", "ReviewID": "R1QP5P0SJ8DZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received the set about 2 weeks ago. I paired the TV with an Onkyo AVR and Infinity Entra Point Five 5.1 system. I'm mostly commenting on the video since I have my AVR doing all the audio.Setup was pretty easy. Had all the necessary cables (Monoprice). Using the AVR to up-convert all signals to 1080P. I have one cable going from the AVR to the TV. My XBox is the older model so I have to use the component connection along w/ a Toslink digital cable to the AVR. Xbox looks AWESOME. The set handles DVD, Netflix and gaming all very well. In some dark scenes I got some pixelation on the DVD Takers. It happened once. Other 2 DVD movies I've watched I did not notice pixelation. I think after I tweaked settings on both the TV and the AVR everything was fixed. I'm sure as the days go by and I tweak more it'll get to exactly where I want it. I played both Forza 4 and Gears of War 2 and they were beyond my expectations. Amazing is all I can say. I saw no lag or noise while I was fully immersed in big battle scenes in Gears. The game is pretty dark but I can't recall seeing pixelation. Playing Forza was a whole new experience. The vistas and the tracks just look perfect.I have DirecTV as my sat provider. HD signals look fantastic. Game of Thrones looks like a friggin DVD! Standard def TV looks great too since the AVR is doing the up-conversion but the TV handles the 1080p signals flawlessly. I watched the NBA Finals and the NHL finals and the TV does the high speed action with ease. No blur whatsoever. I guess the 480hz refresh is doing its' job! I've seen some edge-lit LED and they just do not pop like the full array LED does.I also have an AppleTV hooked up and it too looks great. Again here the AVR is converting the 720p signals to 1080p and the TV handles it all in stride. Using Airplay to watch my iPhone vids is really cool. The vids look really good and no matter how crappy my vids are the quality of the video is perfect and there is no motion blur at all.Problem areas? There are a few. No deal breakers for me though. The TV does 3D using active tech. Although I have not yet tested this out (no 3d component yet). Most sets going out nowadays are of the passive type. This basically means that the glasses do most of the work and are therefore more expensive. Again this is not a deal breaker for me because I did not intend to use the 3d capabilities of the set.VIA apps are OK. They are really sluggish and Pandora seems to hang quite a bit so I use the network capabilites of my AVR to play Pandora. Netflix is pretty good but I use the XBox for that. The Yahoo! weather app is OK. Flickr is OK. I just don't see myself using those all that much until they mature a bit. Anyways with my Xbox, AppleTv and AVR all having network capabilities I'd rather use those.So using this TV basically as a giant monitor it does the job hands down. I looked into the Samsungs, Sonys, and LG's but they did not measure up in the specs with regard to refresh rate and full array LED for this price range. Simple as that. When you look for a set try to future-proof it and buy as much specs as you can. I'll expect to have this set for at least 6 years. Don't be afraid to buy a Vizio. They are now a player with the other Big 3!PS. One big concern I had was the reflectivity of the screen. My living room is very well lit with light sources to the left and behind is the walkway to the kitchen. My previous RPT was like a mirror. When I installed the Vizio I do get a little reflection from behind but not enough for it to be an issue. I'd say my setup is probably as bad as you can have it with regards to glare for Tv's. With that said this Vizio is fine in the glare department.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "For the cost, you really can't get much better than this. Avoid if you're a PS3 owner.", "Author": "Ral K.", "ReviewID": "R2HMJFGG496EAI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update 2 (9/26): Unfortunately, this TV is not at all compatible with my PS3. It seems that when there's too much action and brightness going on in the screen, the TV's refresh rate is simply incompatible and causes the flicker to black happen. I have tried EVERYTHING and crossed off every possible variable (hdmi cables, network cables, TV settings, etc). It simply doesn't work. I can reduce the chances of it happening to about once every hour, but for a $1000 purchase, I simply won't accept that. And as luck would have it, only certain PS3's have this problem.That being said, this TV -is- good for the price; there's nothing wrong with my set. It simply cannot serve my purposes, nor the purposes of other PS3 owners out there.Lowering review to 3 stars.I was hesitant to make this buy since it would be my first major purchase, online no less. I really wanted to get the most bang out of my buck. I use this set mainly to watch Netflix/TV and to play on my PS3. I have NOT tested the 3d yet. (Good 3d is not a dealbreaker for me, but judging from other reviews, this set's 3d seems to be just fine)The good:- Picture quality is EXCELLENT. I've seen the Sony Bravia LED's, Samsung LED's and Panasonic plasma's in action, and this is on par with that picture quality, if not nearly the same. The only notice-able difference is that it doesn't handle glare quite as well, but I'm not going to dock too many points from that since the picture is simply outstanding (and the settings to adjust for this are available). This TV does wonders for your Netflix/Hulu picture quality (watching Iron Man 2 on Netflix was at least DVD quality, if not better). The PS3 has these built in, but using the TV versus using the PS3 to watch creates a quality difference worlds apart. You're paying $500-$1000 less for nearly the same picture and same features; to me, that spells a really good buy.- Full LED is impressive. I've been hooked ever since I saw the LED technology mature in recent years, and this set incorporates all the good things about it. Great black levels, no overheating, etc.- Simple and accessible. Set-up is really simple to follow, yet comprehensive enough for those who want to take the time to calibrate their TV's perfectly. You also really can't go wrong with 5 hdmi ports, a component and composite input, a PC/Mac input, a digital audio output and an RCA audio output. It has everything you would need to build a good theater system.- Cost: I've done a TON of research. At this size, this is the only LED-LCD set that is under the $1000 range. This set even beats out some 42\" sets from other brands, and doesn't even include 3d. The other comparable item to this in terms of size, cost and picture quality would be some of the Panasonic plasmas. If you're more a fan of plasmas, feel free to go for those -- they're really good as well.The bad:- Choices of apps are lackluster. I'd imagine you would use Apple TV/Roku if you had it over the ones that are included in this TV. But, it does include the essentials: Hulu Plus, Vudu, Netflix and Facebook/Twitter. Here's to hoping they add YouTube soon. This set uses Yahoo TV widgets as a source of apps, by the way.- Randomly blacks out: This may be the ultimate dealbreaker for me at the moment; testing it out within the remaining days of my 30 day window to see if it still happens. When playing on my PS3, the screen has randomly blacked out for a few seconds before coming on again. This would be more tolerable except for some games, a disruption like this is really unacceptable. I've researched this online and apparently the problem lies in the Adaptive Luma advanced TV setting. Turning this off will force your TV to not adjust to the room lighting: given that video games have a wider spectrum in terms of brightness and color than most movies. I'd imagine this solved the problem. I'm stress-testing the TV for the next few days/weeks to check if it still happens, and will be updating this review if it does.- Sub-par audio: Definitely better than some of the other stock audio out there, but still not within my acceptable range. It's fine for most TV shows and movies, but when you get into the games or action movies, you'll notice the difference. I recommend turning off surround sound and volume control when playing video games, since the TV's smart audio system is not smart enough for that. Better yet, invest in a good soundbar/audio system.Bottom line: Absolutely great set for the dollar value. There are some noticeable problems but not enough to outweigh the benefits of the set (except for that one pending dealbreaker). Unless you have the money to spend or can wait until the next cycle of TV's roll around, you'd have a difficult time to find a deal better than this. (I'd be surprised if there are Black Friday deals that offer a set with the same size/features much cheaper than this price point)I recommend giving this set at least a try by ordering it from Amazon; Amazon is a great shipper and you'll have the peace of mind to freely test this baby out for 30 days.

Baker", "ReviewID": "R1ULOPZLPK7MQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading reviews here and on Cnet, I was driven, consumed, and unfulfilled until I bought the Vizio XVT3D474SV. About six months ago we bought a refurb Vizio 720p 32\" screen for the bedroom, and it has performed great, for it's intended purpose.I ordered the XVT3D474SV after a very close comparison to a popular LG model with passive 3D and the Wii type remote. The Vizio is active 3D, and comes with no glasses.I have spent literally hours viewing sets at BB, Sammy's, Wally World, and Sears. Wally World sells Vizio, BB does not, and Sears doesn't stock them here but you can order from a limited selection of models. Wally World and Sammy's carry certain models only.Now here goes my rant...........I have a Panasonic Plasma that I love, and up until the day this Vizio arrived, in my humble opinion, it was the most rich, vibrant image I had ever seen in a Telly.The setup of the XVT3D474SV was so easy and complete, I could have done it with half my brain tied behind my back! They offer a guided setup that covers every aspect except the fine tuning that we all like to tweak with. It found my wireless network and connected with ease. Part of the guide sets up the Bluetooth remote for you, and with the touch of a button, the remote was programmed to operate my cable box, something I particularly liked.After setup, I powered up the cable box, it was on an HD movie channel, and I nearly soiled my trousers. The image from this LCD, full array LED set blew the socks off my plasma, and is better than any Samsung, Sony, or LG set I have seen at any price, including the sets that go for three grand.You can tweak the settings to your personal liking, but you will find crisp, clear, vibrant video that will mak you wonder if Amazon made a mistake and left a leading 1 off the price. Not just a bargain, a downright steal.Have not tried the 3D yet, but from the reviews, it is very decent. Most people do not watch a lot of 3D, so average performance will be fine with me. i truly expect the 3D to be something to rant about also, and will once we pick a 3D Blu-Ray, and some active shutter glasses.Vizio is supposed to release a replacement for this set in October, but a s with all new models, the bang for the buck cannot be beat, even if the set shines above the XVT3D474SV.Get one of these before they are gone. I defy you to find any other set at the $950 price point that is even close to the picture quality of this model. One step further,  you cannot find a $1,500 set that provides the viewing experience I am talking about here.If I had it to do over, I would have bought the 55\" model, it is similarly discounted, but you pay for the extra screen size.The full array LED is not on the 42\" model, it is edge-lit, and  I believe the refresh is 120. Probably not a bad set, but the 47\" and up models are full array LED, which means the LED banks go throughout the screen for more accurate correction of inherent flaws in LCD screens relative to brightness errors, and deeper colors.  Also, I have seen many LED sets with a 120 hz refresh that still suffer from motion blur, like in sporting events and fast action scenes. My Vizio advertises a 480hz refresh rate, which I believe is truly a 240hz with interpolation to 480. There is absolutely no motion blur on this set, just like the plasma sets, as this motion blur thing is another inherent flaw in the LCD type HD television.Buy a 47\" or the corresponding 55\" model, and buy it from Amazon. I ordered on Tuesday and it was on my doorstep Thursday, at a price that is fantastic.I am not an electronics expert who knows all the terms dealing with flat screens, LCD vs. plasma, optimal refresh rates, hue, color saturation and the like, but I am anal about reading every review I can find, and I spent a lot of time studying the images of LG, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Philips, Toshiba, and the Vizio models for sale locally.OK, my ranting and raving is over for now. They could have made the widgets for Netflix, Vudu and the like full screen, but I can deal with it. I have never heard good audio from built in speakers inside any flat screen, and the audio here is average. Those two issues are the only downsides I can come up with, the audio I can fix, just like you have to do with any brand and model at any price, and I can live with the Netflix and Vudu widgets being. 1/3 screen instead of full screen although the Vudu does go full screen after you make a keystroke with the cool Vizio Bluetooth remote.

In 2D this thing will knock your eyes out (in a good way).Believe it or not, the TV sound is great. It's twice the sound quality of my Samsung. It's perfect for anyone who doesn't necessarily want an additional sound system. I've only had it up to about 30%, but that's very loud for us.The widgets start-up is slower than molasses, but I think that's a function of most TVs in general. Once they load up, they're very responsive and easy to use. We called Vizio customer service...they spoke American English and were patient and courteous; terrific, they helped us get the widgets started.We did use the price matching service offered by Amazon and again, they did exactly what they said they would do.After a few months of owning this TV, I have only compliments and strongly recommend Vizio.

My hesitation with Vizio before purchasing was really around durability, an issue that most sites actually rate Vizio amongst the top in.  In the end it came down to any comparable model was likely to run at least $300 more than the $897 I paid for this model and their reviews were frankly not as good.  I have now had this TV for 3 weeks and been able to experience a number of different programming options and try out different display settings.  So far there has been little in the way of disappointments.Out of the box the screen was a bit bright as is typical but a quick run through an old THX calibration disc I had helped straighten out the contrast and brightness issues.  There are a ton of presets for visual settings and \"movie\" was the closest to what I wanted so I played a bit off of those settings to get my \"personal\" setting.  Having replaced a 60hz traditional LCD, my biggest wish for this TV was to see great contrast.  I was sick of watching a black screen during the darkest scenes of many movies on the low contrast LCD I had before.  The black levels on this TV are superb, though I wouldn't put them at quite the same level as the high end plasmas as some reviewers have suggested.  I haven't noticed any serious blooming which was a minor concern on the 3SV model.The 480hz or whatever this TV actually possesses for a refresh rate is fantastic while watching sports.  I have watched many football games so far and the picture was fantastic, however where I really noticed the difference was in the hockey game I watched last night.  The image was absolutely stunning and being able to make out one individual black puck on hard passes across the contrasting white ice was what really sold me on this TV.3D content is difficult to judge.  I have two channels through Comcast available, ESPN3D and their other 3D channel that does a lot of Discovery like programming.  There has been a wide range of performance between the programs.  Boxing on ESPN3D was impossible to watch and I felt like I had been the one punched in the head, seeing double with every motion of the fighters.  A documentary on the last shuttle launch was more enjoyable, though lots of motion in 3D is difficult to watch as it is tough to keep the images correctly aligned while moving so quickly.

I wanted to share this as I know how hard it is deciding on a new HDTV. First, I would like to let you know that I have bought 3 big screen TV's in the last year for my large home. My first was the Panasonic TC-GT25, 50 inch plasma 3D. It is a great TV and has an excellent picture and 3D image. I also bought a Samsung UN46C6300 LED  HDTV. This one is also a great TV. Whites are a bit brighter than the plasma TV, but it has no 3D. I purchased this Vizio 47 inch with a bit of skepticism, since I had great TV's from Panasonic and Samsung. My budget was limited and it was cheaper than the Samsung and had 3D, where the Samsung didn't. I used my prime membership and got overnight shipping for $2.99. This Vizio is more than great for many reasons! It's price is exceptional and the quality of the picture is Better than the Samsung for less money and has 3D. I think if you are looking for the best 3D picture, you should go plasma, but this Vizio is really close to my Panasonic plasma in 3D! Also, I love the apps! It has so many apps that are very usable, and wifi was picked up immediately on this TV. I had to buy an apapter for my Panasonic, which was $112.00 to get Internet! So, I wanted to let those of you that are skeptical about buying this HDTV, that you will be very happy with your purchase. Coming from someone who has all 3 models, because of a big 2 story home, I think I can shed some light on this subject! Also, the TV is very easy to set up and using the remote becomes very easy, even in the dark, once you get to know all the buttons. If you text, the querty slide out is easy! I got this 47 inch LED 3D HDTV, the Vizio Bluray 3D player, ( also with apps) and 2 free pair of the 3D glasses with overnight shipping from Amazon for a total of $1,022.00 :) Now that's a Deal!

One advantage of using the Vizio VBR-133 3D Bluray player with the Vizio XVT3D474SV is that you can adjust the display settings to change the size of the video that streams from online sources such as VUDU/Netflix/Amazon/YouTube.The performance of 3D with the Vizio VSG-102 active shutter glasses depends on the source, but is excellent and without flicker. A lot of the complaints I have seen, seem to be from people that may not know how to use their equipment and make big mistakes like using the wrong version HDMI cable or have a bad 3D source. I have seen some sources of 3D that produce flicker, but this is not a result of a problem with the TV.I watched Captain America in Bluray 3D and the picture was incredibly clear, and certainly full HD3D. It was better quality than seeing the movie at the theater. Aside from a little bit of sheen the 3D elements came through crystal clear and without any flicker, and the color was excellent.I also watched using Cox HBO OnDemand the picture quality was lower in quality as the signals are optimized. This does impact the performance of 3D, as 3D seems to amplify the artifacts or flaws in the video. I wrote this citing the actual model numbers just in case someone tries to copy and paste this review elsewhere that you know the exact model number this review is relevant to. I wish more people would do that.Bluetooth & Audio:I love that this tv can transmit audio using AD2P via Bluetooth wirelessly. What also adds to the audio utility is that the TV has a single optical output which can be connected to an amplifier so that whatever the HDMI source is to the TV you don't have to switch modes on the amplifier. This saves a lot of annoying settings changing between media sources, and makes for cleaner installations and less wires. Especially when you consider you have 5 HDMI inputs to work with. (Thank you Vizio designers we like you!)Motion Smoothing:Motion smoothing can make some video a lot better, but movies use motion blur for artistic effect. If you turn on motion smoothing, it's so good, all the blur is eliminated so the people and all their motions look like a home video. In fact if you watch movies with motion smoothing on you'll notice that movies seem more like play's than movies, and you probably wont like it.Motion smoothing is best used for animal/space/cooking/documentaries or news. There are a number of applications for motion smoothing that make the experience better. I was really happy with this feature and its execution, and wish there was an easier way to turn it on and off rather than having to go through the menu to find the feature because I turn it on and off quite a bit.Vizio VIA :Vizio's VIA (Yahoo! Widget/Apps) is great. To get the most out of the TV the apps have added a lot of functionality and it's important to know to use them. You can download the apps you want, you can arrange them in the order you want, you can even display different information from each of the module icons that are docked at the bottom of the screen. Also you can use some apps while you watch TV. VUDU has a notable interface makes browsing movies very fast and easy with trailers and previews.Criticism:The Vizio VSG-102 glasses are about 60 dollars each, and they don't come with cases. They're also a bit heavy and do not have adjustable nose nor do they fold for storage. They do however work very well and can be worn for a single movie without comfort or fatigue issues. Having to charge the glasses is something to remember, at least with a 24 hour battery life you wont be as worried about running out of juice half way through a movie.My Rating:5/5 Value5/5 Performance5/5 FeaturesConclusion:I got a Vizio XVT3D474SV 47\" 3D HDTV for ($949.99) or a final price of $1,103.33 with a 2 year extended warranty (tax/shipping included). The TV worked with my existing wall mount. All I had to buy were some screws to mount it. I was going to buy a LG for basically the same price, and canceled my order when I saw the XVT3D474SV. The Samsung/LG/Sony/Toshiba/etc. none came even close to what this Vizio has delivered at this price point.I would say that this particular TV at this moment in the market, given all the features, performance, and price is a phenomenal buy. This TV is more than just a TV, the Vizio crew has added some convenience to my life with this design. From the QWRTY keyboard built into the remote control to the 160 zone full array LED with local dimming that actually works very well, I can't imagine anyone regretting this purchase.

The first one was a disaster, not Amazon's fault , but a poorly designed LED Toshiba ($2000) that had majar hummimg issues.  It finally died after 6 years - well..not really - I just elected not to change the $200 bulb since I couldn't stand the humming anymore.What caught my eye on this TV was the following:46\" LED HDTV for less than $1000The Amazon reviews were coming in very favorable.The 3D option is not serious - there is no way I could watch 3D more than 15 minutes - unless I was looking for a 3D splitting headache.  It is kind of \"neat\" - but the technology needs more work.The Visio brand was not on my short list of \"favored\" brands - I was looking for a Samsung, LG or Toshiba.  But here, the price break was so great, I felt I needed to take a closer look at this model.  I had read the reviews and checked out some models at the brick and mortar stores.  Bottom line, I liked what I saw, I liked what I was reading in the reviews and combined with the price differential to other models, the deal was sealed.Inital reaction:WOW  -  the model that arrived at my doorstep far exceeded my admittedly lower expectations based on cost & brand.  Very easy to set up . yada yada, very easy to program the remote to work with both directv and my yahama receiver , yada yada,  very easy to connect to the internet , yada yada - but it's the 2D picture that is WOW!.What make the picture the WOW?  - colors, whites are whites and blacks are blacks - the 480 Mhz doesn;t hurt either - especially if you're big sports fan.

It has turned itself off twice due to \"inactivity\" even though there's a program going on; haven't found a setting to remedy this.I disagree with some reviewers about the sound quality. Though sound quality will not equal that of a stereo system, it's decent for a TV of this size. I like the fact that it incorporates an equalizer, which serves to increase sound quality. Picture is excellent, especially when watching high definition program.  3D picture is decent.One thing I really find unacceptable is the fact that the base doesn't swivel and doesn't seem to support the TV correctly. The TV itself is light and can be easily tilted forward with minimum effort; this could cause it to fall and break or cause injury.

And to get an LED TV, especially 3D for this price is amazing. The TV itself is fantastic. The apps are great, the picture quality is amazing, refresh rate is higher than most other LED/LCD TVs that I have seen and it's got more than enough HDMI inputs. My one complaint about the TV itself is that because of the angle I've found it pretty tough to screw in the coaxial cable to connect it to cable. If you have satellite or DVR that uses HDMI then this wouldn't be an issue. And even so, it's not impossible, just difficult. And the TV is so great that it's worth it anyway.The 3D on this TV is very good too. It's very crisp and keeps a really good picture while in 3D. It is active 3D which means that the glasses are much more expensive than the glasses for passive 3D. And now given how good a lot of passive TVs have become if I were to go buy again I might look for a passive 3D TV. But in general active will provide you with a better pictures. You just have to think about how many sets of glasses you'll need and whether you want to pay to buy them. Vizio's glasses were a little cheaper than other brands when I bought mine so compared to other brands this TV is still a fantastic deal.The remote on the other hand...not so good. The remote is connected to the TV via bluetooth which I loved. It's got an apps button and a slide out keyboard that makes using the features of the TV a breeze. However, the ribbon connector on the slide out keyboard is notorious for coming loose which then makes the entire remote unusable. Mine broke after about a year, which from other reviews I've read is substantially longer than average. But I just bought a universal remote and programmed it to the TV and it works great.Overall this TV is great. Great picture, great 3D, great features, just a poorly designed remote.

The unit just worked out of the box and so far is a pleasure to own. The audio is not 'great' as some reviews claim. It is just OK. You simply can't get deep bass from titchy speakers.

Moore \"Mac Insomniac\"", "ReviewID": "R5AA3MITR8EDJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The setup, including unboxing, took all of 15 minutes, thanks to easy onscreen directions. WiFi and bluetooth (for the great remote) are both nearly automatic to set up. The remote with QWERTY keyboard makes entering long strings and searches really simple and intuitive. In the middle of the setup, I added a new Apple TV, and both Apple and Vizio made it really simple. I had to wait on both units to do their automatic firmware updates before using the system, but it was worth it, as new services have been added.The TV is all black and the lighted \"Vizio\" name at the bottom quickly gets out of the way- non obtrusive, unlike some brands. The stand comes preinstalled and is plenty sturdy. I wish the TV had a matte screen, but so far glare has not been a problem for my application. When you first turn the TV on, it takes a few seconds for anything other than the homescreen to come on, probably because it has to initialize the web connection and some of the apps, the only minor negative I've encountered.Picture quality is just amazing- I defy anyone to show me a TV with any other as good (and I looked a lot). The presets are great right out of the box, and I don't feel a need to do a full custom calibration. Sound is also quite good, thanks to some decent wattage, speakers (although small) and virtual surround sound. Most other TVs totally skimp on sound, figuring you'll use a home theater sound system anyway. If you want to go that route, it is easy to connect to audio, in half a dozen different ways. There are also plenty of HDMI ports for multiple devices. 3 USB ports are also there, and I understand the latest firmware update finally turned them on. (A full-featured Blu-Ray player can easily add other peripherals such as SD card readers and other USB support.) My Panny 210 3D BR player, and Vizio 3D glasses (get them through Amazon- cheaper...) have arrived, and the 3D experience is pretty good, although there is a little ghosting. I consider any 3D at all a bonus and not a deal-breaker.It's not just about the awesome specs- this picture delivers. Colors are accurate and nearly jump off the screen. Depth of field is remarkable- almost looks like 3D on some high-end TV shows (and just with an antenna so far). One reason for this is there are so many shades of grey available and viewable, along with true black, that one sees much more detail in the background of a scene than one may be be used to. Mixed with the decent built in sound, this is a true HD experience. (Sales people in my local BestBuy know this set and said they wish BB would carry this and other Vizio TVs for the value they offer.)The internet apps are excellent, launch quickly, and can stay out of the way. Regular programming is always viewable while you use/watch an app. The whole system is really intuitive and simple to navigate. HuluPlus and Pandora are two of the most recent additions. No YouTube yet, but it's available on most WiFi Blu-ray players and Apple TV anyway.There is no iPhone app to control the TV, but there probably will be. In the meantime, the bluetooth remote that comes with the TV is simple and straightforward to use, very powerful.Conclusion:  This TV is a great size for an average living room. It is beautiful to look at even when turned off. It is a real performer that has as good a picture as the over-the-top specs would lead one to expect. The sound, while not as good as a dedicated home theater system, is much more than decent, and likely good enough for most people. There are many, many inputs and outputs. If you care about it, the TV comes with active 3D. It is fairly thin and hardly uses any electricity. The warrantee (and add on warrantees) are good and not overpriced.

The brightness on that set was starting to dim due to heavy use and light halos were starting to appear at the corners. I took it as an opportunity to upgrade to a higher refresh rate set with better contrast.Vizio wasn't originally on my consideration list. I somehow had the notion of cheap quality sets that invariably ended up being sold refurbished on Woot. But some online research showed consistently excellent reviews for more recent models while maintaining unbeatable value for money. In particular, I could not find any other 47-inch Full-array LED TV in this price range - period. Note that I wasn't even looking at 3D TVs. I was also not interested in Edge-Lit LED TVs, though those were available in this price range. Looking closely at the reviews showed that the lower ratings were mostly for the 3D, which I did not plan on using anyway, so I was sold.Pros and Cons follow. I have not used (and do not plan to) the 3D feature, so this review will not cover that aspect.Pros:1. Fantastic picture quality and contrast. Blacks could not possibly be blacker. When watching 4:3 content, the sides do not even look like they are part of the screen. One of the first things I did was turn Smart Dimming ON (why is it OFF?) and Ambient Sensor to High. This TV has seriously given a fresh life to many of my games. I'm not the documentary kind of guy, but I found myself fascinated with shows like Wild China on Netflix. I am not exaggerating: this is one of the best picture quality sets you can get even if you go to twice this price range.2. Apps. I did not think I would use these much, but I did not realize this comes with Pandora. I already have a PS3 and Roku for the usual suspects (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) but having Pandora on the TV is awesome. I also did not realize the apps work over wi-fi, which is great as well. Pandora took some fiddling to get it to work though; I had to change the DNS settings to OpenDNS.3. Easy packaging. The TV is fully set up out of the box and the box is very easy to open. At 50lbs, it was also a very manageable weight, though I wish there were better grip spots on the sides of the TV.4. Good number of inputs. I cannot imagine needing more than 5 HDMI ports. Other inputs are adequate, though folks with older peripherals may need switching devices for more composite/component inputs.5. Bluetooth. The remote is bluetooth, which is convenient in that you don't need to point it at the TV. The real killer was bluetooth stereo headset support. I already have a Motorola S305 and was able to pair it to the TV. One of my biggest gripes with the PS3 was the inability to listen to gameplay through my headset (only for chat), so this was a huge bonus, especially with a light-sleeping infant at home. On the flip side, the volume through the headset is rather weak and increasing the volume on the TV does not seem to help.Cons:1. The TV frame has a shiny piano black finish, similar to my old Samsung. This worked well for the Samsung which had a perfect frame to show off. The Vizio frame has several slight undulations on the surface, which are exaggerated by the shiny finish, making the set look rather cheap up close. I'm sure that's not the effect Vizio was going for. I don't mind some cheapness in the frame, but they could have made it less obvious.2. The audio sucks. Turning off SRS auto volume makes the volume very weak. Keeping it on causes inappropriate fluctuations in the volume. The volume suddenly drops to very low levels at times when the TV seems to think something loud is coming on, and then takes several frustrating seconds to recover to normal levels. The sound has very little depth and feels flat. The contrast between the picture and the audio is sadly stark. It looks like I will definitely need a home theater with this one. I might end up just getting the Vizio HD Sound bar. I wasn't originally planning to, so this is an unexpected extra expense.3. The stand does not swivel. It has a compact footprint and seems sturdy enough, but surely you can do that and make it swivel too?4. The remote feels very cheap. The slide out mechanism for the keyboard does not seem too sturdy, and frankly, I don't think a keyboard is required. The numpad could have very well been used to enter text as well in the few instances that it is required. Basic dedicated keys like closed captions, picture mode switching, etc. are missing and hidden under menus. Keys are not backlit, though that's not a big deal.5. Switching TV channels (I just use a HD antenna) is slow and the channel guide is fairly basic. Some menus and fonts are not crisp and appear a bit dull. I'm guessing Vizio did not optimize these for individual TV sizes and resolutions.7. The smoothing feature makes sitcoms and movies appear more like the mid-afternoon soaps. I don't know how this effect comes about, but I ended up turning it off for this reason.8. Switching inputs / picture modes / resolutions causes both audio and video artifacts (light crackling/static) for a second during the switch. Not very confidence-inspiring in a brand new TV.9. When I first opened the box, I was dismayed at how shiny the screen itself looked (my Samsung had a matte screen), but reflections haven't been much of a problem with this set while watching content. I imagine that this could be more of an issue when watching darker content in a brighter room.10. When viewing the screen from the sides, all colors take on a visibly blueish tint. This isn't an issue when sitting on the couch, even the far ends. Only when up close to the TV and viewing it from the sides.11. Apps are very sluggish and sometimes refuse to launch if you've had the TV on for too long. Netflix and Pandora seem fine once you have them up and running, but getting there is a hit or miss. Sometimes the interface just hangs for a few minutes and jamming Exit on the remote doesn't help. Even other functions on the TV remain sluggish for a few minutes after you've exited Apps, as though the TV were recovering from the processing overload. Reminded me of that old \"if cars were like computers\" joke.Overall, I would definitely recommend this TV, especially for the price. Adding a home theater or sound bar would make it near-perfect.UPDATES 8/30/11:1. There was a firmware upgrade in Aug which seems to have made the Apps a little more responsive overall. It has also revamped the Netflix UI. The earlier Netflix UI was similar to that of Xbox - single row of titles with preset tabs on top. The new UI is actually the most functional I've seen yet, even better than that of my Roku. You can browse almost every genre imaginable. On the flip side, the titles look a little hazy, meaning the UI was probably not optimized for Full HD.2. The glossy screen is turning out to be a little more annoying that I initially thought, especially when peeking at the TV from the kitchen during the day.3. I have since purchased the Vizio HD sound bar and a Sony sub. Very happy with the audio experience now, though I'm not so happy about the added clutter to my living room. The TV can be configured so that the TV remote can control the audio on the soundbar seamlessly, which is great.4. Video static when switching inputs still exists, but is very fleeting now. Audio static went down as well, but reappeared with the soundbar. With the soundbar, I now get a brief, annoying 'rustle' each time I change a channel or input. However my research shows that this might go away if I switch from optical to RCA. I'm going to give it a few weeks before I do just that.5. I've bought a Jabra Halo stereo bluetooth headset to use with the TV and the sound output volume is excellent. There is a half-second lipsync delay when using bluetooth audio, but its not too bad. Turning bluetooth audio ON/OFF is a pain since it is hidden several layers deep behind onscreen menus. Also, it appears that even if a movie is paused, or any similar scenario when there is no audio output, the TV is still actively sending blank audio to the BT headset, so you do need to turn ON/OFF BT audio on the TV each time to prevent burning through charge cycles rapidly.6. The frame imperfections are getting more and more obvious as I see the TV more often with the screen off. Really Vizio, no excuse for that. I'm seeing this (i.e. cheap, uneven frame) as a common occurrence with Vizio TVs even on store display units.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent television quality at a good price", "Author": "Pete99InMe", "ReviewID": "R1ZE23YNYRO4S6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research over the last year, and after having the set in my home for the past week, I am convinced that this Vizio television is as good as any on the market.

The colors were spectacular for an LCD based model, the screen was anti-reflective, and black levels were near perfect, and Vizio has decent customer service to top it off.Now.. Some issues this model seems to have across the board include extreme ghosting/crosstalk on 3D titles which makes it impossible to enjoy, and on 2D, when you use the smooth motion feature \"real cinema mode\" which most people deem as the soap opera effect (which I love) this tv makes the image judder once every 4 seconds or so, which was just unbearable. For being one of Vizio's top models, I was very dissapointed. Doesn't appear that a firmware update will help in the future either, and just in case it was my tv in particular, I had a technician from Vizio (for free) come and replace the mainboard, to no avail.If you are someone who has never had these features, you may not even notice the flaws, and if you dont care for either, this is a great tv for standard 2D picture. The Netflix app works even better than the computer version, which amazed me.

Watching ESPN 3D on Verizon Fios gives you a better feel of depth more than poping out you images.Sound is fair for built in 10watt x 2 speakers. You cant expect great sound from built in thin bezel tvs. Few internet apps available. Basics like Facebook, Netflix, Pandora are there.Note that this TV is not a thin model by no means.

When I first bought this TV, the Internet apps were just so-so, but they get updated about once a month or so and now they're great. The updates for Netflix have made it better than any other version I've seen (Roku, PS3, Xbox, etc.). 3D movies look great on this TV, but there aren't that many available at this time. But even if you aren't interested in 3D viewing, I still recommend this TV because the picture quality is so good.Remember to buy high speed HDMI cables to connect blu-ray players and sound systems to the TV. I almost returned a Sony soundbar/subwoofer system because I thought it sounded mediocre, but once I connected it with an HDMI cable it changed everything. I also recommend spending some time tweaking the display settings. You can buy blu-rays that help with this. A friend loaned me a blu-ray boxed set (I think it was \"Life\" narrated by David Attenborough) that had a video calibration program included with it that helped improve the screen settings. I also read a few recommendations online for eliminating the \"soap opera\" effect and a few other tricks for improving picture quality.I felt like I took a pretty big chance buying this TV because I'd always had the impression that the Vizio brand wasn't that great, but I decided to trust others' reviews.

(If you don't, I recommend plugging your ethernet cable in before you even start up the TV, along with any other devices so the TV can recognize them in set-up). The set up is a walk through process and with the querty keyboard on the remote is pretty fast. Within 5 minutes I was updating my status on facebook. :-DThe picture quality was phenomenal on my Xbox gaming system, no glitches, frame skips, or anything, it's the clearest I've ever seen my Xbox games. After that, I wanted to watch an HD movie (but I don't have blueray), this is where the TV blew my mind. I set up an account at VUDU using my spam email addres just in case, and they let me watch a free movie in HDX (a $5.99 value). I picked out the movie \"limitless\" and let me tell you that the picture quality was better than any TV I've ever seen, and blacker than I've ever seen during blackouts, it blew my mind.I haven't experienced much more, but I can tell you that I no the other features will be just as good once we get out cable box set up for downstairs.

Also got a pair of rechargeable 3D glasses thrown in free (listed @ $125) with their time limited coupon. So basically w/ CA tax & some whatever $10 fee around $1046 out the door. Haven't tried the 3D as of yet and will hook up a Vizio router sometime in the near future thru Amazon which has a great price @ $50. After some volume issues right out of the packaging box with the TV and then calling tech support it ended up being a bad HD box from Cox cable. To be honest I was pretty upset with this volume issue thinking oh man here we go already with problems and long phone calls to fix this problem or possible an early return and maybe the search continues. TV was fine after replacing with another HD DVR cable box.In no way am I a HD tech kind of guy but I know what looks good and the picture quality is absolutely gorgeous with many fine tuning options for your liking. I even bought the cheaper HDMI cables from Amazon ($1.83 ea.) and they work just fine. For me I like the \"basketball\" setting and have tweaked a few other minor settings. Adjusting is simple and easy with the remote. The picture quality did look great right out of the box and had the stand already attached which was nice. The speakers work I think pretty darn good after reading other negative reviews. Good audio tweaking options also available and the speakers are on the front lower panel not in the rear like so many other thin line makes and models. Also what attracted me to Vizio is that I can hook up my older Denon stereo receiver and Sony SAC DVD player because Vizio has the RCA outlets on the back for older stuff plus 4 HDMI's for the newer stuff. Can't do this on many of the other brands so for me this was a big deal. Always can update to a blue-ray or new sound system in the future.Keep in mind during daytime watching there is a very noticeable reflection on the mirror looking black screen and the very shiny grand piano looking black TV border and stand, but to be honest it doesn't really bother me all that much because the picture quality is so good. I was watching a baseball game during the day and I could still see the blades of grass and dirt clods. Evening viewing...WOW! Just don't park it front of a lamp or heavy light source and you will have no complaints.I only state all the costs above for reference and hopefully something to go by for what is possible out there money wise. I have been researching HDTV's (Samsung's, LG's, Panasonic's) for over 8 months now and am very happy with this Vizio. I did not even buy this thing for the 3D aspect but will definitely try it out later. Was watching an old black & white Humphrey Bogart movie on Turner Classic the other night and after a slight visual tweak that even looked way beyond what I thought would be possible. Normal 2D shows almost take on a 3D look because of the depth and clarity on the screen. I assume this what is called the \"Soap Opera\" effect but for me I like it. I am not a gamer and don't ever plan on doing that so can't comment on that aspect.Bottom line, lots of bang for your buck with this Vizio. So far so good and am loving it and just wanted a TV with exceptional picture quality and I think it definitely delivers. A friend of mine has a newer 46\" LED 2D Samsung (he paid $1150 @ Costco awhile back) and I think this Vizio is equal if not better but with a lot more perks. Will update later on the 3D and internet capabilities and god forbid if something else goes haywire. You know, when you pay out a grand + you just don't want any problems, aggravations or hassles down the road.

I'm a big sports fan and love watching nature documentaries, two shows where HD really shines!This TV looks great.  Sports and the Planet Earth documentary look terrific.  So far, I've checked out baseball, tennis, soccer, and even a couple of football replays.  Picture quality is awesome.  Watching tennis on this TV was very cool.  Should make hockey look pretty good too.  Psyched for football season to get started.I have it in my living room which gets a lot of natural light, and the screen does very well.  There's certainly a little glare, as you would expect in any bright room, but I'm very happy with the performance.  It doesn't disrupt the viewing experience.  If the window (light source) was right across from the television with light shining right on it, the glare might be significantly worse.  I have very large windows on either side of the TV, and it looks good.Set-up was very easy.  The apps are pretty good too.  Netflix looks great!  Pandora works very well.  Haven't checked out Vudu yet because the TV cannot receive streaming 3D yet.  As a result, haven't checked out the 3D yet, but looking forward to it.

Checking out pictures on facebook or flickr is nice.All in all, given the product and the price, I am very happy.UPDATE 9/10/11Still wouldn't change my purchase, still happy with the product, ALSO STILL WAITING for the firmware update that others have been mentioning.Without it, Vudu cannot stream 3D content, and the blockbuster and hulu plus apps are not available.  The update is also supposed to make the USB ports functional for viewing pics and playing music.Finally got around to checking out the 3D.  It was fun and I'm glad to have it, but I was a little disappointed with the quality.  For me, 3D was just a bonus for an otherwise great deal.  If these are your expectations, I think you'll be all right.  If you are buying this TV for its 3D viewing, you might want to think again.  Ghosting is significant.  In both 3D blu rays and vudu streaming, 3D images are ghosty and at times blurry.  It's MOST noticeable on opening credit screens.  With writing on the screen, you can really see how much the quality of the picture suffers.Lastly, PIP requires a different source.  This is pretty common, I guess.  So, you can't have to separate pictures from the same cable box.  You can have your cable on one screen, and your computer/blu-ray/second cable box or source on the other.  It's fine, I guess.  Not something I would use that often anyway.  I do stream sports on my computer, though.  My BIGGEST COMPLAINT about PIP is the lack of a \"swap\" button.  You can't quickly toggle between the big screen and the small screen.  You have to manually change it each time.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT 1080p Picture, Nice 3D", "Author": "Dexter \"Dexypoo\"", "ReviewID": "R2K9TB8PG5RGLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is amazingly clear.

The games I have played so far in 3D are Black Ops, Crysis 2 and Killzone 3. Crysis 2 and Killzone 3 both let you adjust the amount of depth that is visible in 3D, I suggest turning it down to around 20 percent for those games. The games look good once you adjust the amount of depth, otherwise it is very disorienting and there is a lot of cross talk. Once you turn it down it looks really good and is just about on par with the movie Alice in Wonderland.

The universal Bluetooth remote's full QWERTY keypad simplified the set up process even more by being able to slide the remote open and type away. The picture is truly great! Clear, crisp, beautiful colors make the whole room come alive and the 10 million:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio delivers really deep blacks and bright whites. Setting up the wireless internet connection was equally as simple. It was all completed in the set up process. Make sure you have your wireless router number handy when you start set-up and this computer will find it quickly. You just have to program the code from your wireless router into the system.  Getting connected to Netflix, Amazon, Rhapsody, Flikr, Facebook, Twitter as well as the latest news, sports and weather through Yahoo was a breeze. This set replaces a Sony which has a good picture, but it doesn't compare to this TV. I paired my Vizio 3D Blu-ray(tm) Player with Wireless Internet Apps with a Vizio 47\" Class Full Array TRULED(tm) LCD 3D HDTV and purchased the Vizio 3D glasses.  Streaming movies from Netfilx, Amazon, and Vudu has been a snap.  We've played Blu-ray(tm) and DVDs, Audio CDs, MP3s and Jpegs without any difficulty.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm Loving This TV", "Author": "SD Review", "ReviewID": "R25H6C1B9MXBOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've owned this TV for about a month and everything I've tried that's digital has been amazing!The picture quality is great. I've watched cable, over-the-air digital and analog TV, DVD's and Blue-Ray. Picture quality on all HD channels has been spectacular with drop off on Analog stations (yes, we still have them). When I've watch the Lakers or football it was almost as if I was sitting in a seat in the stands.  As a test I watched the same movie on Blue-Ray and Amazon HD rental. The quality was comparable and even with the slowest Internet cable speed there was no pixelation.This Vizio isn't a super slim TV - probably because it uses back lighting. It has better quality speakers than any slim TV I have seen which is a benefit until we upgrade the sound. I spent months looking at TV's in stores and checking prices on the Internet. At one time or another, we almost bought a Samsung 8000 series and a couple of Sony TVs. I can honestly say the picture quality on this TV is as good or better to my eyes.I haven't watched 3D yet and have no desire to do so anytime soon. I am not a gamer. So you'll have to depend on others for that. If you'll base your decision on 3D and currently have a decent TV, you'd probably be better served to wait a year to purchase.There are plenty of ports. I have my cable box hooked up through an HDMI port and a Blue-Ray 3D player connected to another. I use the cable connection for the antenna. There are now multiple digital stations on most over-the-air TV stations and there are Internet channels available through this TV and the Blu-Ray player so my choices go beyond the cable offerings. I already canceled my movie channels and will be renting though the multiple online services available to me. This whole watching through the Internet thing is going to get real interesting and this TV is perfect for that with a full keyboard built into the remote. Everything I do with this TV is controlled through the Vizio remote control. Cable, Antenna, Blue-Ray and Internet programming were all easy to configure.I noticed one of the reviews mentioned something about a grainy picture. A comment my wife made, may shed some light on that. She was watching something and mentioned she could tell it was recorded on a set. That's right, this TV displays details that I don't believe were meant to be seen and some backgrounds look grainy. If you watch live TV (sports, news, etc) you will never see anything other than a perfect picture.I am pleased.

The 2D video looked great and even the 3D video looked good.  Then started noticing problems.  When viewing programs in SD format, there sometimes appeared a thin horizontal line going across the top of the screen with flashing dots.  This did not occur when viewing programs in HD. The USB ports on this TV are useless.  They can only be used for maintenance purposes and cannot be used to view pictures or videos.  After 7 months of operation, the TV speakers started making a loud snapping noise when changing channels. Tried different audio settings, no help. After 9 months of operation, the TV video started to randomly blank out for 1 or 2 seconds when watching cable channels.  This did not occurr when using the over-the-air antenna.  Apparantly a problem with the HDMI port.  Tried using a different HDMI cable hooked up to a different HDMI port on the backside of the TV. The video and sound problems went away for about 3 weeks, then reappeared. Contacted VIZIO for maintenance service. The suggestions they gave did not fix anything. Decided not to waste anymore time and effort to fix this TV.  Ended up getting rid of this TV and buying a similar TV from a different manufacturer.  Hopefully the TV from the other manufacturer will prove to be far more reliable.

As a TV its a great device. The picture quality is excellent, the sound is very good and the set is easy to use ... except for the Internet.INTERNETAs an Internet device it has some irritating foibles. First the Internet password. I have had WLANs of one kind or another in my house for a decade so I have some experience with them. In that time I have attached a dozen different laptops with internal and external WLAN adapters, a half dozen different kinds of phones, various wireless print servers and other devices. Right now I have seven PCs and a half dozen phones and other devices attached to the WLAN. The Vizio is the first device that would not accept a complex password containing spaces.Right now I have two Wifi WLANs running, one on a Netgear dual band 802.11A/B/G router and the other on a LinkSys 802.11N/ router. Having dual bands, each router has two separate WLANS each with its own SSID for a total of four SSID. But all share the same WPA-PSK/PSK2 passwords. The password is complex consisting of several groups of alphamerics separated by spaces.The Vizio would not accept this password and as I said it is the first device I have encountered that would not accept a password with spaces. When I raised this with Vizio Tech Support as a bug the answer was \"no its not a bug, it does not accept spaces.\" I raised it as a bug  because the Vizio VBR333 BluRay Player I bought at the same time works fine with spaces so I assumed this was a bug in the TV! Vizio's response to that fact was basically \"well, it shouldn't.\"Neither the HDTV or the the BlueRay recovers from a WiFi problem well. If you lose connectivity for some reason, or have a power failure, neither the HDTV nor the BluRay retain the password. So when things come back up you have to manually re-enter the password to restore connectivity. I've only ever seen this once before in a really low cost WiFi adapter, one that I dumped at the first opportunity.I'll expand on this review as I gain more experience with the device but I doubt that the Internet connectivity situation is going to get better. Vizio didn't seem interested in changing either the password \"space\" matter or the password retention matter. I'm now investigating how I can run Cat 5e into the family room to connect the TV/BluRay on a wired LAN rather than the Wireless.As a purchase the 3D, LED and 480Hz features are great and worth the price. The WiFi connectivity and the Internet Apps are part of the package so there was no additional expense involved but they are disappointing --- I could have just stayed with my Roku box. Unlike my shiny new high-function Vizio, it works flawlessly with my WLAN.PIP/POPA purchaser should be aware of the PIP behavior. I've had sets before that had the PIP function and one of the features was a \"swap\" function to do exactly that, swap the Main screen and the PIP screen. There isn't such a function on this set. You have great flexibility about the choice of inputs for the PIP screen and you can even select the audio source, Main or PIP. But unfortunately you can't simply hit a button and swap the Main and PIP window contents. I also cannot find a way to change channels on the PIP source, its staticREMOTEThe remote control does not appear to implement the full command set at least for the DirecTV HD DVR. The \"color\" buttons that are used by the HD DVR for moving through the guide, and other functions are not active in the Vizio remote. They aren't crucial but it is an annoyance. For example in the the HD DVR \"program guide\" the Red Green and Yellow buttons are used for moving through the guide +12 Hours, -12 Hours and Guide Options respectively. These are not implemented in the Vizio remote.INTERNET - UpdateSince I bought this I have encountered the \"lost password\" problem 4 times now.

Was connected to the Internet in seconds.Setup:  The packaging was great, it was real easy to remove the TV. The TV walks you through the setup when you power it up and turn it on.  I was worried that I would have to go through an extensive process to get the settings and picture I desired, but this was not the case.  The remote setup for my cable box (Scientific Atlanta) worked quickly without a hitch. From beginning to end it took less than 10 minutes to completely setup this TV!Picture:  I've only used 2D so far.  The picture is incredible.  It looks way better than it did in the store.  There are no inconsistencies across the entire screen.  The unit is in a room with a door wall and window and still the picture is brilliant enough.  Watching movies, hockey and basketball have been awesome.  I have Wide Open West HD cable.  I'm waiting for my Sony 3D Blu-Ray player to arrive.  When it does I'll update this post.Sound:  The sound is much better than I expected for standard TV speakers.  This will give me more time to investigate an eventual audio upgrade.Pro's: Great picture, incredible features for the price($1,399 w/instant rebate at Costco), easy setup, WiFi works flawlessly. Decent sound.Cons:  No \"Page Up/Down\" on remote and the top line of the QWERTY keyboard is too close to the top slide so it makes it a little difficult to type those characters.

After seeing this unbelievable picture quality, I realized that the sound was lacking. So I purchased a Blu-Ray surround sound system and hooked it up easily through the TV. Now it's a thrill to watch!Read through these reviews, it was very helpful for me. Not only in deciding which TV to purchase but there was some very useful information. Example; if the TV turns off by itself, it's updating the software so don't do anything! It will come back on in about 60 seconds. Luckily it hasn't happened but once for me and it wasn't during a football game! Resist the urge to turn it off and on and just patiently wait.The other thing was that I hooked it up to HuluPlus. It worked fine until I had over 100 items in my queue then it would freeze up on me. This is a Hulu thing with Vizio and they have a solution if you go on the Hulu site, which is to clear the queue. It worked again after I did that, and Hulu is working on a fix for that too.If you get this TV you will NOT be disappointed!

Mathur", "ReviewID": "RKXTPMV3SN58D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this TV as a wedding gift in August 2011, when it was on mega-sale for $900 (including two 3D glasses & free shipping). Since then, I've used many of the features, so I will try to make this review comprehensive. In short, this TV is amazing, and as a result I watch it way too much. Everybody agrees that the 2D picture quality is top notch. You can adjust just about every aspect of the image if you're into that. I've only tried the 3D mode on a couple of previews from Vudu, and it is definitely way better than at a theater.The VIA apps are very useful too, especially Netflix, although I do have a gripe with that one. The Netflix app needs some bugs fixed and features added. It doesn't always remember where you left off watching a movie, and has no surround sound or CC support. No stars off there though, since this is Netflix's responsibility. The Vudu & Amazon Instant apps are great, and little additions such as weather, traffic, and Facebook integration are nice pluses. The built-in Flingo support has also been really useful for me, to show friends the occasional YouTube video that I happen to run across on my laptop.I run all audio through my surround sound system, so I can't really comment on the TV's speakers. However, there is full HDMI CEC support which allows the TV to control my surround sound's power & volume as necessary. It's nice to not have to push multiple buttons (on multiple remotes) to turn everything on ... HDMI CEC automatically turns on/off HDMI-connected devices as needed. For example, if I switch the TV to the bluray input, the TV automatically turns on my bluray player and switches my surround sound input to bluray. Conversely, if I insert a disc into my bluray player and press play, the TV automatically switches its own input (as well as the surround sound input) to bluray. Basically, HDMI CEC is implemented quite nicely on this TV.Bluetooth headset support is nice, although it has noticeable audio lag (which is actually expected on bluetooth). This lag can be lessened through the TV's 'lip sync' audio adjustment. I may have to try with a better pair of bluetooth headphones to see if that helps.Since I've had the TV, Vizio has already updated the firmware once, and have promised another update with native YouTube support. Their customer support is responsive, and all in all they seem to be a great up-and-coming TV company.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great buy, great picture", "Author": "Brian C Keele", "ReviewID": "RB3OX635BVY2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:1.

I was really thinking that the 3d would be OK at best, but I was wrong. I haven't watched 3d on any other TV to compare, but I can't imagine how they would be any better than this one. The glasses are a little bulky and take a little getting used to, but no more so than the glasses you have to wear when you go to a 3d movie in the theatre in my opinion. The 3d picture is a little darker than the 2d but from what I understand, that is the same on all 3d TVs. We have ordered two or three more 3d movies now because we enjoyed watching 3d so much on it and can't wait to get ESPN 3d working on our cable box so we can watch the BCS National championship game in 3d.If you are on the fence about this TV, I say buy it, you wont be disappointed.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Nicholas Callea", "ReviewID": "RF7YKAUPNLXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV 3 weeks ago to replace my almost 5 yr old 37\" LG LCD that died.

I've never seen 3D on other TV's but we've watched a few 3D movies on it and it seems fine to me.Sound: solid for a TV but I'm no audiophile so sound is not a big deal to me. My only complaint here is the feature to automatically manage volume changes (like loud commercials, etc) sometimes lowers the volume too much and also during the show/movie your watching. I know I can disable it but it should work better or at least have a setting to how much it will regulate volume differences.Setup/connectivity: Setup was easy though the wireless networking was a bit of an issue (my wireless network is locked down by MAC and I wasn't able to find the MAC on the TV during setup so I had to disable that on my network to allow the TV to connect).All the basic apps are there and more. I'd like to see a browser added.Overall: We love it. For under $1k we got an awesome TV that also happens to have 3D and came with a pair of free glasses.

The 3d picture is good, but there is some ghosting. I did not find that the ghosting hurt the 3d experience at all after watching Avatar in 3d. The sound is very good (I am no audiophile) and the sounds are loud and clear. For less than $1000 this is an amazing deal. The remote control feels a little flimsy and picks up fingerprints easily, but the full keyboard and Bluetooth are great features. The television came shipped attached to the stand, and removing it from the box and setting it up took less than 10 minutes. The appearance of the set is not as slick as a Sony, Samsung, or Panasonic, but I think the quality of the picture greatly overshadows any reservations you may have about its appearance. I was afraid of buying something that didn't come from the big 3 television brands, and Vizio's \"Walmart\" reputation certainly made me worry this tv would not stack up to its reviews, but I think it's an excellent choice!Pros: Features, 2d picture, easy of use, priceCons: Slight 3d ghosting, appearance isn't as sleek as more expensive tvs.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "47\" Vizio 3D TV LED", "Author": "Eaglesmom \"Eaglesmom\"", "ReviewID": "R2M1VHA18WSZ13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loving our 47 inch 3D  Visio.

The thing that amazed me is during setup, cascading through the brands that this feature or support, some of those names are unheard off. I think even a four year old child will know the name Verizon, or maybe a 12 year old might recognize CISCO, but VIZIO do not support it???Day three...still trying to crack the VIZIO remote to work on the CISCO DVR, so I Googled \"Cisco set code\" to a furum and someone mentioned that Motorola and Cisco looks very identical in appearance, so I thought, maybe just maybe, it might worth a try.

The picture in my opinion is outstanding, as is the sound.  I had purchased a sound bar with subwoofer for my previous Panasonic TV and the in-unit speakers in the Vizio TV are far superior to the sound bar.  Sometimes it even feels like surround sound altho I have no rear speakers - don't know how I am getting that effect.  I have not yet tried out the 3D feature as the new model from Vizio goes to passive from active so I suspect the 3D active glasses will come down substantially in price in the near future.  Anyway, 3D was not particularly important to me.  Set up of this unit was very easy.  I have an old Belkin router in the same room as this TV will be situated and had originally thought that I might have to figure out how to daisy chain a new Vizio dual band router with the Belkin router to obtain a good pix.  That did not turn out to be necessary.  I tried out VUDU hi def for a movie and was just blown away at the pix quality and smoothness.  Netflix also worked immediately and with no problem.Now for the downside comments (which I hope are temporary) - this unit has a terrible plastic smell which is apparent both when the TV is turned on and when it is off.  I hope that nothing is burning up or overheating which will end up in a failure of the unit and that the smell will dissipate over time.  I purchased this TV at Sam's Club for under $1000 and have 90 days to return it so there is still plenty of time left.  In addition, there is the occasional \"pop\" in the audio.  I have read about this before and have no idea if it too will go away over time (it did in the case of one owner I read about, at least).  I'll be contacting Vizio customer support after July 4 to see if they have any advice on these issues.Since the new passive 3D model (which won the CES 2011 award) will apparently not be available until the end of this year (price?), I think that for anyone who wants excellent sound and picture this TV is an excellent choice.  The only caveats are my negative observations commented on above.  If the smell does not go away, it is strong enuf to warrant exchange of the unit for a new one.July 15, 2011 update -The picture on this TV continues to be fantastic and the burned plastic smell diminished a bit but is still strong enough to be annoying.  There also developed a slight popping sound in the audio when beginning playback of DVDs.  I contacted Vizio customer service which first said to just wait it out on these two problems until I explained that I had been running the TV almost 8-10 hours a day just to get rid of the odor.  Then, they reversed themselves and offered to swap the TV out.  Since I had bought at Sam's, I thought it would be easier and faster to just drive over there and pick up a new TV.  Did that this morning and found that the price had dropped another $100 so I got a small bonus for my trouble.I am interested in the comment indicating that Vizio is coming out with a 71 inch LCD model.  Does anyone know what the model number is and/or when that model will be commercially available?", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great TV with some caveats", "Author": "Eric Fontaine \"TexasTriathlete\"", "ReviewID": "R3KF01TSHC6ST3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased this from my local Sam's club with high expectations after reading online reviews. For picture quality this TV is top notch.  The only issue I have noticed is that the local dimming feature produces some bright blooming or corona effects around bright lights in dark or black backgrounds.  Other than that, you'll be very pleased with the picture.  The sound is OK but I expect many will hook this up to external audio.  Ours is a bedroom TV so we're using the medium-quality built-in speakers.  They are fine but lack richness, bass, etc.Here are the caveats.  This TV died 24 hours after I got it home.  It only took tech support a few minutes to pronounce it dead.  They offered in-home repair in just 2-3 weeks.  Really?  So the store has my money for nearly a month while I wait on a tech?  Sorry - not happening.  So I packaged this monster back up (which was made much easier by the well-designed boxing these come in) and hauled it back to Sam's.  Got it exchanged and hauled it back home.  Now it works fine - or so I thought.  Some time later I connect up a DVD player (not a blu-ray).  Hook up the HDMI and I get video, but no audio.  So I grab my older, smaller Vizio from the office and connect to the same DVD player.  Both video and audio work fine.  Call tech support - they answer after a reasonable wait (kudos to Vizio for that!).  Tech support goes thru a few steps, eventually falling back on, \"Well - let's just unplug everything a wait a few minutes.\"  Eventually they concede that it must be something about my DVD player that isn't compatible with the TV.  I explain that no, it's the TV that doesn't work.  Since the DVD player seems to work with every other Vizio TV I have (a total of 4), then something is wrong with this one.  They basically tell me that it's just not compatible and there's nothing they can do about it.  What a shame.  I thought HDMI was more or less standard.  Yes, I know there are different variations - but you'd think a tiny bit of backwards compatibility would be in order.So buy this TV if you want a really good deal on a great quality picture.  You'll also get thoughtful packaging, reasonable wait for tech support, and should enjoy it a lot.  But don't be surprised if little gremlins creep in or you find certain features just don't work.  You get what you pay for.  Overall, I didn't want to spend twice as much - so this TV is a good compromise.  But it IS a compromise nonetheless.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "very happy with this purchase", "Author": "Kenji M Hamanaka", "ReviewID": "RMCGO5N9ZNP54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for several years now.

I have been enjoying it since and I have had no glitches so far. The only thing that I have noticed, only rarely, is transient mild fluctuations in volume. I bought this TV as it has a full array LED-LCD panel with local dimming. In my research I found this technology to be the best in terms of picture quality. Vizio was the only brand offering this panel technology with 3D for less than $1000 at that time. In an ideal world I would have bough a plasma panel for both 2D/3D quality but I have had issues with the longevity of plasma panels and hence decided against it. This technology apparently comes close to plasma 2D picture quality. I will present my review based on categories that were important to me:1.Price: There is no TV out there that lets you check all the option boxes and still come out less than $1000. Vizio is no longer a little startup TV company. Yes, they still have issues with design and there reliability is still under scrutiny but they have come a long way. they can easily hang with the big names and sometimes surpass them. At this price point you cannot ignore this TV. A comaparable full array, local dimming, 240Hz(this one is marketed at 480Hz), 46 inch(this one is 46.97\"), 1080P, 3D enabled, internet TV is atleast 600-800 more than this set. Having said that, I do see that the price is now increased to >1500. At this price its \"bang for the buck\" value is debatable. In this scenario I would definitely be looking at the Samsung UN46D8000 TV. I mention Samsung here only because of its long term reliabilty and also the picture was better on the samsung but the difference was only subtle. That is why this TV is a great bargain if you can get it for <1000.2. Hardware and setup: The quality of the build is good but not stellar. The plastic on the TV is glossy and looks cheap. The TV  does not win any accolades for design. It is industrial but practical. The remote also has average build quality with the same cheap plastic. The qwerty keyboard however is a brilliant idea. Although the slide out mechanism of the keyboard may break early. The buttons on the remote are good and thoughtfully placed. The remote can function as a universal remote and it does fine at that. The inputs on the TV are phenomenal. 5 HDMI inputs is an HD enthusiasts wet dream (4 is the most I have seen unless we are talking high end models). Setup was a breeze and it took all of 6 minutes.3.Software: The interface is very user friendly. The menus are well laid out and very thoughtfully designed. The internet apps are also well designed and very easy to use. The wireless connectivity is consistent. The widget gallery is great and HULU plus, Vudu, netflix apps work seamlessly. The integration of these apps is one of the best that I have seen. I have streamed HDX(1080P) movies from vudu without an issue. My wife was amazed at the picture quality and the consistent nature of the connection. 5/5 for this.4.Sound: It is average. I use the sound bar a lot so I have not experimented with this too much. However, there is some minor and rare volume fluctuations that dont bother me too much at this point.5. Picture: Here is where the TV makes itself worth every dollar that you spent. The 2D picture quality on blu ray discs is fantastic. It equals or sometimes beats even the best sets out there. The colors are realistic, the black has depth, the contrast is great( I believe it is 10mill:1). One of the websites had given below average ratings for picture quality and I do not understand that, I think it was televisioninfo.com. If you get a caibration DVD and play around you will get better results. I think the local dimmimg needs to be worked on as darker scenes are sometimes way too dark. Blooming that people talk about is apparent once in a while. 2D via the cable box is also very good but there are some channels that become too bright and washed out and some that are too dark. I find myself going back and forth between different picture modes while watching cable. This happens once in a while though. 3D via the cable box is HORRIBLE with lots of ghosting. 3D via blu ray 3D disc is acceptable with good depths but no \"pop out of the screen\" awesomeness! I think 3D technology in general is in an infantile state and it will be a while before we get to an industry standard. Do not buy this for the 3D. The samsung plasma panel is still the best 3D TV out there. Another issue is the price of the glasses, I was lucky and got it for 55 dollars for two pairs but they can be north of a 100 bucks. With a few tweaks you could still have the best picture on any set but dont expect that straight out of the box.6.Customer service: No experience yet and I hope I dont have to use them.7.

I was very reluctant to purchase the TV online because this was my very first purchase from amazon. I was in the process of building a entertainment center in my bedroom for the tv so it stayed in the box until I had completed it on the fourth. My excitement was overwhelming me to get this tv installed, I had looked at the box for 4 day's. Finally the day comes, I installed the tv on the fourth. I was amazed at how easy the set up was with the remote. I have direct TV so I had also ordered a new HD DVR for it. I will tell you that trying to hook everything up new at one time was a little difficult because every piece of equipment was trying to get you to do a first time set up at the same time.I broke it down to one item at a time and managed through the process. I loved the fact that the remote actually worked the satellite box. loved the slide out keyboard. The TV picture was amazing. Best picture that I had ever seen. My kids were so excited they ran to the store and bought a 3d movie to watch on it.  I noticed that changing channels there was a larger than normal delay 3 to 5 seconds before it would change, the screen went black for 3 to 5 seconds before the picture would come back up. Needless to say that when they returned with the movie, we put it in to watch the 3d and see how it looked. this is where it all went bad. the screen went blank for about 20 seconds after changing the input. I waited patiently...soon a bleep of the disc menu then back to a black screen the a bright white screen with 3 vertical black lines separated the screen into four sections as the visio apps logo came up. The colors were not correct they were rainbow or sychadellic??( not sure how to spell it) very hard to read. I immediately stopped the 3d player, changed the input back to the satellite and the picture switched to the broadcast but the quality didn't change I managed to strain and make out the tv settings and did a factory reset. It did not help. I then turned the tv off unplugged all of the (vizio 3d) HDMI cables unplugged the tv and let it stand for about a minute. Plugged it back in and the same almost unrecognizable picture without any inputs. I tried to call vizio support and they were shut down for the day. the next day was a holiday so they were closed again. I called amazon, and they said no problem, that we could just simply send it back being it has been less than 30 days. I was impressed how easy the return was, I printed out my return lables and the following day UPS came by to pick it up. although they were supposed to call first to schedule a pick up, My wife took of the next day from work and they picked the tv up. This was yesterday, 9-7-2011, They said I should get a full refund within 3 to 5 days of them receiving it. I hope so, I will update this review and let you know. The tv does produce a lot of glare as I read in previous reviews, I loved the remote, wish it would be back lit. what little bit of the picture I saw was amazing. I really didn't care about the 3d but bought it because of the refresh rate and contrast ratio. I couldn't get it connected to my wireless internet connection, but I didn't try long. I was too excited to see the picture. This tv might be OK, I could have just received a lemon, we have 3 other vizios in our house and all of them work great. I just dont think that I have the confidence in this new tv to replace it with another one like this.Update 9-14-2011, received my full refund as amazon promised, Thanks amazon for making it an easy process....I will start buying a lot more from you.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Completely useless after 2 years", "Author": "BPEZ", "ReviewID": "R34AE6PXPRK92D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this TV in September 2011 and it was great.

(should mention that during the time we had the tv it would  flash a black screen for a second wile watching it from time to time). The tv started working properly for 2 more months until one day in early October (2013) we started losing the picture then it would not turn on again at all(only vizio logo would flash). JUNK!

In November while my wife was watching the television, the colors went wacky, she turned the TV off and then when it came back on, the picture was fixed, but the sound was gone.  It started working for a couple days, and started repeating.  After contacting Vizio and receiving instructions to do a \"power cycle\" the television completely stopped working.  After calling into the service number, was given a repair date a week later.  I'll update when the \"repair\" happens, but I'm disappointed in the durability and the repair response of Vizio.Edit:  The repair occurred a week after the warranty issue was first reported.  Had to call both the repair company and Vizio to find out why the repair technician wasn't on time, and was given a story from the repair company that there was a mix up in the schedule.  When he arrived, replaced the T-connection card (tech said he didn't know what it did, but was told to try to replace it first . . .)  Television is now working but after the tech left noticed the Wifi wasn't connected.  After contacting Vizio again, was told to do a power cycle and the issue was resolved.  Strongly considering the extended warranty at this point since the \"T-connection\" card was faulty after less then 5 months of use . . .Edit:  After using the TV for a year, it has been reliable since the initial repair, but did opt to extend the warranty another couple years just to be on the safe side.  TV still has the occasional reboot, but nothing like what originally happened.  Increased rating to 3 stars due to increased reliability after repair.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV!", "Author": "A.

Customer Service is AMERICAN and HELPFUL! The wait times are very short, and everyone has been super friendly with setup and registration. I LOVE the Bluetooth and keyboard features of the remote, powerful features indeed. The main issue I don't like is the fact that there's no option to \"auto-allow\" 3D content. You'll have to confirm \"Yes\" and \"OK\" twice to accept the 3D content. Also, the universal remote feature is a bit confusing to setup if your external device isn't recognized, but works none the less.PROS:+ Dual-band Wireless N+ 240hz (480hz is a marketing gimmick)+ LED Quality is excellent+ 2 Year Warranty!+ AMERICAN Customer Service!+ Keyboard on remote with universal features+ Plenty of HDMI outputs, along with ARC+ Can use widgets while watching TV+ Active Shutter is better quality, though more expensive to replace glasses.CONS:- Lacking in widgets, like Hulu and others.- Currently, NOT 3D-supported by Vudu, except for 2011 model. May change.- Universal features can be bothersome to setup- Remote not backlit- \"Multiple\" 3D confirmations, with no auto-allow- 3.5mm jack is NOT for headphones, only PC audio hook up.Picture Quality, feature set, AMERICAN customer service set VIZIO apart from the crowd. Not to mention they have been highly rated for the past 2 years. Buy VIZIO with confidence!P.S. Even better, I got for $879 with Amazon price matching, 2 free pairs of active shutter glasses, and 24 months no interest!NOTE: You will want to upgrade your router to dual-band for the best streaming quality of Netflix and others. If you have a house with lots of walls/sq. ft. and/or a roommate/tenant. Go with the Cisco-Linksys E4200 Maximum Performance Simultaneous Dual-Band Wireless-N Router if you want the absolute bleeding edge in speed and torrenting, go with ASUS (RT-N56U) Black Diamond Dual Band Wireless-N 600 Router, Hardware NAT, 5 Internal Antennas, AI Radar and Graphical Traffic Monitor, but you will sacrifice your throughput significantly. Yes, I have tested these both, in a 2 story house with a basement and lots of walls, and the guest network (E4200 only) is great for tenants/guests to keep off your network. ASUS offers torrent functionality, which is nice, but not an equal tradeoff for significant loss in throughput in my opinion.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a good price", "Author": "jkthomas", "ReviewID": "RU9JVRNEKVW0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture on this TV is great.
