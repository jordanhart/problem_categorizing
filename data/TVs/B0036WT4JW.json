Simple pleasures. Simple needs. I will research a major purchase enough to know what will stick around for 5 to 10 years depending on how much technology changes, look at my budget, and fire away with the best purchase I can make.That being said, my requirement was 1080p, 240Hz, 55\" with a Blue Ray player. 3D didn't matter to me at the time, but when I saw the deal for this TV, which included 3D, the Blue Ray (with 3D) and the glasses and the (How to Train Your Dragon) movie for a cheaper price than what I was pricing just the TVs for in previous weeks, I snapped it up.The results, pure and simple, are stunning. We watched Train Your Dragon with the 3D glasses and were quite frankly blown away.Yes, in this day and age, everyone wants to be the expert of what they know and poo-poo anything that is not professional quality, not top-of-the-line whatever and will write extensively about it...and this is actually a good thing for sure. But to me, does the technology deliver? Absolutely! Was I blown to the back of my seat. Absolutely. Was the quality of the picture great? Absolutely. Will 99.98% of purchasers like this product? No. They will LOVE it. The rest can write 10,000 words about how and why spending the extra money will prove to be the better choice for exactly 6 weeks until the next more-awesome thing comes along to trump today's tech.Simply stated...you want something that is great and will last for years? Come get it. It's here, it's cheap enough to say yes, and you will not regret the purchase if your life has more to do with just being entertained with what you have instead of always pondering what you could have.There will always be Ferrari (and the like), but somehow I think the rest of us simply enjoy a really well built, reliable, affordable car with a good sound system that will last.This is that purchase. Let the Porsche and Ferrari owners duke it out over track times and performance that most likely they will never experience from day-to-day anyway. And if you do like performance above all else...be prepared to pay for the experience that comes with it.

The cloudy lighting issue some see with the Edge-lighting technology reported on the 2009 product has been greatly improved for 2010 and I can't really say I even noticed it a in a black scene.

Leetham \"ViDeeOhPhiUhl\"", "ReviewID": "R2536G8X1CP0VO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've owned this television for a few weeks now, and I've been putting it through a battery of tests using a variety of different sources and room lighting conditions.  To get right to the point, I am returning it -- it will be picked up this week -- and waiting for either the UNC8000 precision dimming edge lit led set, or perhaps either the XBR-HX900 or XBR-LX900 from Sony.  The C7000 is a good TV.  It compares favorably -- if not signficantly so -- to any of the edge lit led lcd's that Samsung released in 2009.  However, it doesn't hold a candle to the UNB8500 that was released late in 2009.  It is also outperformed by Vizio's latest (552), the Sony XBR 8, and even LG's LH 90 gives it a run for it's money and outperforms it in a few important areas.  Essentially the performance of the C7000 is either matched or exceeded by multiple televisions that cost significantly less. If you are not a videophile and do not concentrate on picture performance in a completely darkened room, I'm sure this television will suit you just fine.  However, if you are a videophile and/or picture performance in a completely darkened room and accurate reproduction of theater film viewing is very important to you, this television is not for you.  This TV exhibits many of the same problems that plagued Samsung's 2009 series of edge lit led's -- namely, a lot of light shining through from the corners, top and bottom, and sides of the picture while viewing in a darkened room -- and does not perform the way you would hope for a television that costs this much.  Samsung did improve upon the fluctuating back light problems of last years edge lit led's.  This television does not have a fluctuating back light problem at all.  However, I must come back to the issue of light shining through from the edges of the screen.  It's a big concern for anybody who wants to reproduce a natural theater experience and view films the way they were meant to be seen.  You simply cannot recreate that experience with this television.  When you view a film -- or any other content -- in a completely darkened room, it is impossible not to notice the light shining in from the edges.  That is a huge problem for a lot of us.  I will say that when you are viewing a film in a bright room, this television is an outstanding performer.  It is also an excellent performer for viewing sporting events, animated features, and other lively bright content in a brightly lit room.  Of course, most of us do not wish to pay $3,300 to only be completely happy with our televisions when we are watching them in a brightly lit room.  The light shining in from the edges also creates the potential to create a lot of problems with 3D viewing once we have sufficient 3D content available.  Imagine trying to immerse yourself in a 3D viewing experience and not be able to focus on the 3D atmosphere due to the fact that there is light shining into the viewing area.  I just don't see it working.  It seems that it would be a major obstacle in viewing 3D content.  Imagine going to see Avatar in 3D or IMAX 3D and having light shining into all of the edges of the film.  There's just no way that it wouldn't distract you and take away from your viewing experience.  I foresee this being a huge problem for 3D viewing once we have the content.  I will discuss some of the positives of this television because I don't want anyone to think it's a bad television.  I would have really given it 2.5 starts out of 5 but Amazon doesn't allow for a half star so I went with 3 because the positives probably do outweigh the negatives on this TV.  The color accuracy is what we have all came to expect from Samsung, which is to say it's flawless.  The black level is outstanding -- if not up to par with the local dimming led sets such as the 8500 and the XBR8, or the Pioneer Kuro 151 plasma -- and does not have the fluctuating backlight problem.  The black level is definitely better than last years edge lit led sets.  The video processing and motion resolution is beyond reproach.  It appears that this particular feature is probably comparable the 8500, which is the only lcd in history to be able to resolve all 1080 moving lines.  It will be interesting to see if this television can do that once the reviews come out and the video processing has been tested.  This television handles 24fps content perfectly, and reproduces the proper cadence of film based content.  It is definitely a good television, it just has some major flaws, and is outperformed by a few sets that cost over $1,000 less.  The potential for 3D viewing problems definitely exists, and Samsung needs to find a way to cure the problem of having light shine in from the edges of the screen.", "Date": "February 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV WITH AN ISSUE", "Author": "Keynote", "ReviewID": "R2JSZAZXLT4JU6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This TV is great. It looks really sleek and has outstanding features. One major problem, I guess Samsung did not learn from last year that it is not okay to have LED backlighting that creates clouds on the screen. I owned last year's model and during dark scenes I could see what can be described as projector type lighting within the screen. The LEDs give off white light that is visible on the screen during dark scenes. Well this TV has the same issue but the lighting looks more visible than on my last year's model. I don't think that this is acceptable for a television that retails for $3299 and that is from a company such as Samsung.I was watching a space movie and my friend could not understand why there were white clouds on the screen. I had to play along since I could not bring myself to say that there were not clouds but the backlighting in the television.I am going to keep it because not many televisions out there can produce the same quality picture. This television does provide great picture quality as long as you get over the backlighting issues. I actually wish the TV was a little thicker since it is too fragile due to how thin it is. I have to say that Amazon is awesome. The order was very well managed.Update 3.24.2010My two cents about 3DI was really excited about getting my 3D glasses and C6900 blu ray player today. I have to say that I am now even more disappointed with Samsung's 3D technology than with the edge lid technology that they are using. I sat on my couch wearing the dorky 3D glasses for about 20 minutes before I could not stand them anymore. Look, 3D is a gimmick and it looks like they got me. I can't believe that I wasted my money on this stuff. The picture in 3D did look better but not enough to get me to sit on my couch for two hours wearing some uncomfortable stupid glasses. Maybe this is why they did not have the glasses available to consumers at launch. I really wish that I would have ordered the B8500 when it was truly available.In addition, the flashlighting screen issues on my C7000 looked even worse in 3D.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "NKC, MO", "ReviewID": "R2NCD72AXFJBST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a video-phile nor do I usually watch movies in a very dark room, but I was concerned by the reviews and debates on going for this TV but selected anyway as wanted a LED LCD and have always had good luck with Samsung.I have a 1.5 year old 46\" Samsung 1080p LCD TV (which at the time was one of highest rated LCD HD TVs), and this new 55\" LED LCD model has a much improved picture quality in my opinion.PROS:  Excellent picture quality.  I have not seen the search light issues but I usually watch it in a moderately lit room.  I did see the issue slightly in the 8000 display model in the store but wasn't enough to bother me, and I would not let that stop you from buying this TV as I think the rest outweighs that potential.Excellent design.  I like the styling of this TV better than some of the older TOC models.  Also the ultra slim design using the ultra slim Samsung mount keeps it very flush to the wall.Neither Pro or Con:  Internet Access.  Perhaps I will utilize the Netflix streaming, but between TV, BluRay Player, Satellite TV DVR, laptop / netbook all with internet access, the internet apps on the TV are not a critical factors.3D - nice to have but not certain of long term adoption for movies and TV.CONS:  None in my opinion.

I made one flawed assumption in buying this TV early on...that Samsung had learned from last years LED edge lighting fiasco and that the picture quality in 2010 would be excellent.  Boy was I wrong! Read on for the reason(s)Quick background, I have the TV hooked up to the same Verizon Fios DVR cable box from my old TV and a brand new Samsung BD-C6900 1080p 3D Blu-ray Disc Playerusing high speed HDMI 1.3 cables (as the 1.4 was not out yet a few weeks ago).First off, this is NOT a \"plug n play\" TV.  My initial picture quality (default settings) using my Verizon Fios cable box was almost unwatchable.  I spent a couple house \"tweaking\" all the settings to find the best picture quality.  I am still playing around with the settings trying to get it perfect (I dont think thats possible with this TV).  The picture quality has improved significantly but I still could not get rid of the clouding issue.  Also, I had to turn the 240hz feature OFF, as the picture quality with it on was not good.  Why am I paying for that feature if you can't use it?....Every show has different picture quality, some shows are too bright while others become too dark.  I am not about to update settings every time I watch a show!Clouding Issue:  The LED backlighting creates a tremendous amount of clouding in dark scenes.  It is very annoying to see while watching a program in the dark.  Samsung should be embarrassed for putting out this product.  The clouding issue seems to be alot more pronounced while watching from the cable box.  The picture quality when using the Blu Ray player is significantly better.I did NOT see any light shining in from the edges in a darkened room as other reviewers have mentioned.Pros:  Very Thin  Sound Quality better than I expected.  It was better than my previous Samsung TV..  Easy to use TV interface and remote.  Picture Quality using the Blu Ray player was excellent.  HDMI 1.4 compliant.Cons:  Clouding Issue  Not able to use the 240 hz feature.  Overall picture quality when not using a Blu Ray DVD is just OK.  Picture is not \"plug n play\"I was not able to test out Netflix or any apps yet although the internet connection seemed to be working fine as I updated the software on the TV and Blu Ray without any problems.  Nor was I able to test out the 3D quality.  I bought the TV before Samsung announced the 3D glasses promotion and I didnt feel like dropping $350 on the glasses...just yet, as I wasnt sure I was keeping the TV.After using this product for a few weeks and giving it a solid chance, I decided to return it. I REALLY wanted to like it, I just can't. I noticed the Samsung UN55C8000 55-Inch 1080p 3D 240 Hz LED HDTV has just been released and has a function called \"precision dimming\".  Samsung claims that feature will take care of the clouding issue, although I havent confirmed this with my own eyes.  So I will be returning this TV and getting the 8000 model. Amazon by the way has been great with handling the return.This TV has plenty of positives..it looks great, the interface and remote are very good.  Sound Quality happens to be very good.  But I couldn't get over the poor picture quality..not from a near top of the line LED Samsung TV with a MSRP of $3300.I would NOT recommend this TV.

Was debating between several TV's (Sony was the main contender), VERY happy went with this Samsung.  First - it is amazing how slim this TV is (this was not the primary attribute I was looking for, but was a nice bonus).  The picture quality is amazing - though there are a lot of personalized settings that you may have to adjust to get the 'perfect' picture for you.  The nice thing is that the settings are 'relatively' easy to follow and adjust compared to my previous tv's.  Sound quality is just 'okay' the setting options (you can focus on voice instead of music in the background etc) are nice, and while effective, could be better.  Though I must admit I have never had or seen a tv with sound settings I am happy with.  Picture quality is absolutely the best out there right now - so vivid and sharp - colors are amazing.  the 240 hz processor can be difficult to get used to.  With regular movies and tv it can seem that the movement is off.  From what I am told it is because the picture is refreshing so frequently that it is weird to the human eye - if you can't get 'used to it' the tv has multiple settings to play with to get the 'perfect' picture / movement / processor speed for you.  3d feature is cool - but 3d movies WAY too expensive.  Also can be nauseating after a while - but children LOVE it (kind of like roller coasters I guess).

Blacks are rich and deep and colors vibrant if not over powering at times. Some dark shadow detail is lost and and subtle color notes forgotten. But it's a colorful picture many will relish. Read our extended picture notes below.Black Level/Contrast: With color information both light and dark appearing so deeply saturated, contrast effect is excellent. Blacks appear inky and sometimes lose dark shadow detail. White light sometimes is distractingly too bright. Contrast appears more intense on the screen than the average of 191:1 post calibration ANSI checkerboard pattern contrast that we measured - probably due to the effects of the LED backlighting and saturated colors.Dark Shadow Detail: As a result of the super saturated blacks, shadow detail can get lost in some scenes. In others, it was fine.Color Rendition/Color Accuracy: Color saturation is a strength of these new LED backlit Samsung LCDs. Colors are super vibrant even if on the unrealistic side at times. It's what our society (maybe not so much purists) likes these days. On rare occasions there is some over saturation within blacks.Motion Lag: The UN55C7000 did a good job eliminating motion lag and judder with the 240Hz feature turned on. However, turning the Automotion Plus feature off does introduce some side to side judder (jerkiness). Neverthless, we recommend this action for especially film based DVDs and movies on broadcast TV.480i DVD and Broadcast Viewing: For any film or broadcast TV non-sports based material start by turning off the 120Hz/240Hz rate feature as follows: Click Menu/picture/Scroll down to Picture Options/Press enter/Scroll down to AutoMotionPlus 240Hz/Press Enter/Scroll or press to Off position. It is important to turn this feature off (see more on this feature under features section below).Calibration Settings: Calibrating white balance was somewhat difficult on this TV.

There was notable eye strain as scenes changed. I found myself blinking a lot and started to get a headache fairly rapidly as my eyes tried to focus and refocus. It was not a smooth viewing experience. The upside to this is that I believe the tired eye experience was primarily due to the content from DirecTV and not the fault of the TV. I believe the content was rapidly patched together for the show and not likely typical of future 3-D content.Aesthetic Considerations: The 55C7000 comes with a 15 to 20 degree swivel quadrapod (our word) table top stand. The stand is heavy, sturdy and gives and expensive quality with its gloss chrome metallic finish. The new 4 legged stand is a gutsy move and I like it. There are accompanying screws to further secure the stand to the TV. The super thin 1.2\" screen depth is accompanied by an improved 1\" bezel frame surrounding the screen. This is an improvement of an inch over last years model. The bezel frame itself comes in a new Touch of Color called Mystic Earth but which is a charcoal gray color. The frame really appears gloss black/charcoal gray.Remote Control/Menu Funtionality: The backlit push button remote control for the 55C7000 is simple, basic and straightforward without the flash of the highest end Samsung models. This standard remote control contains a discrete button called P. Size for changing the video aspect ratio. The overlaid Menu system is very attractively laid out and thorough, but slow and cumbersome to navigate.Audio Output: Sound volume levels seem weak from the 15W X 15W built in speakers. We can understand the challenges for speaker placement in a 1.2\" deep TV. For a majority of programming changing the mode to movie, and utilizing the Clear Voice feature will help a lot to improve voice tone in DVD and broadcast material. SRS TruSurround is a useful feature for HD content but it doesnt help voice tone. Overall, audio delivery from the UN55C7000 was slightly better than last years model, which was not impressive.Features: The Samsung UN55C7000 is loaded with extra features, some surprising, others more useful. AutoMotionPlus \"240Hz\" Refresh Rate: This is a true 240Hz with greatly reduces motion lag and judder in sports programming. But that's the only format for which we recommend it. Media Play: Use this feature connected through USB to keep picture and video files. Clear Voice, SRS and Movie sound options are listed above under Audio Output. We mention the new 3-D ready feature under the PQ section above. Click here for an overview of all the new features on this TV.Internet Connectivity: The 55C7000 series expands the list of potential Internet partners with Blockbuster, USA Today, Netflix, VUDU on Demand, as well as the previously offered Yahoo news, Flikr, witter, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Video. These options are nice improvements from last years package and make it more viable.. Response time is still a little slow when clicking on the various options. This feature is wireless with an optional accesssory.For the full review see LCD TV Buying Guide", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Picture. 3D Was Bad At First. But Fixed It.", "Author": "J. Figueroa", "ReviewID": "R3JMAIWU37TA15", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to wait at least a month before writting my review about this Samsung  TV set. Bare in mind, I have put this TV to every test possible, from gaming to 3D to standard movies. I'm not a techy guy, but I do know enough to give you an honest down to earth review.Picture quality is top notch, hands down the best I've seen in many LEDs so far. I can't vouch for the c8000, but I have seen the models below the c7000 and this is the one to get. Some here have mentioned white clouds and bleeding on the screen, I did noticed it, but took care of it with a few adjustments. The picture modes include, Dynamic, Natural, Movie and Standard. I used Dynamic for games, animated movies and some Bluray movies as well. The key, IMO, is to set the back light from 20 to 17 or lower, contrast to 90-95 and brightness to 45; with these settings I get deeper blacks and well balanced whites. In some picture modes there's the option to set the HDMI level to dark/darker for even deeper blacks. Cable TV is better on Standard or Natural, the Dynamic mode makes the reds look to bright and are hard to adjust in cable.Movies, specially Bluray, look amazing, I have used my PS3 and a Samsung Bluray player, both have done a great job at it. The only problem, specially for my wife, is the over too realistic feel of movies, they look extremely detailed with a film-like quality. I personally love it, but many find it to be too real, hence ruinning the movie watching experience. This however is easily fixed by switching the mode to either standard, natural or movie.Before you even set the TV or try many of its features, upgrade its firmware, it does a world of difference. You can do this by visitting Samsung's website, you'll need an empty USB stick to download the software. In the firmware update, you get extra menu and 3D adjusment options. Same goes for any 3D bluray player; an update is highly recommended.EDITED 3D REVIEWAfter hours of searching the internet, I finally figured out how to fix the terrible ghosting. Even though it is not 100% gone, it is nearly gone. In order for the ghosting to go away, one must let the TV warm up for about 15 minutes. After that, follow tweatv.com calibration suggestions and you will experience a far better 3D experience. I am now even happier with this TV set. Ghosting is almost gone, 2D content is amazing. If you can afford it, get this TV. Or apply to amazon's card for financing. A must have TV. To get the most of the 3D, let the set warm up by having it on for at least 15 minutes with the backlight at 20 on any mode, I prefer Dynamic; after it is warm, before you watch anything on 3D, set the video mode to either movie or standard, drop the backlight to 8 or 9, contrast to 94, brightness to 44, sharpness to 20 and leave the HDMI black level at dark or off. In the 3D submenu, set your set to -1 under the 3D optimize and play a bit with the 3D view point slider, I can't give you a specific value, because some have told me that what works for me does not for them, so try it out. Once you do this, the 3D performance will improve dramaticaly. I love this TV even more now.ORIGINAL 3D REVIEW.Now, the 3D, I find to be the most dissappointing feature of this TV. I get a lot of crosstalk/ghosting. Some more than others. The Shrek movies I got with this set look just OK, there's never a balance in picture quality. When you are trying to fix the 3D image for closer objects, the ones in the background suffer from crosstalk and the other way around. There's a 3D menu item that adjust the 3D view point, this is a slider that can be adjustet from 0 to -5 or from 0 to +5. What this does is, it adjusts the image margins from left to right, so for example, let's say you are watching a 3D movie and you notice the edge of a character sticking out on its left side, you'd adjust the view point to the right(the plus side)and so on. I've tried adjusting every single aspect of the 3D menu, but nothing really gets me a clean picture. I was expecting a good quality, but I can never get it. The 3D picture was its worst during non animated movies. 3D safari, Nasa's Sun, all looked terrible. I have used 1.3 and 1.4 HDMI cables, both give me the same result. I have also tried partialy covering the 3D glasses sensor to see if this would fix the problem, thinking that maybe they were allowing too much light in, but again, ghosting/crosstalk. As of now, I have given up on the 3D feature. I can't handle the dissappointment anymore. By the way, if any of you have any suggestions, please leave some coments.The picture while gaming is amazing, simply sick! I played Resident Evil 5 on my 360 in Dynamic mode, motion plus to \"smooth\" low brightness. The game looks ammazing, super realistic, it was almost like watching a creepy movie. Same goes to Red Dead Redemption, awesome evironments, etc. I should warn you though, the motion plus looks good in some games, but bad in others, specially in fast moving scenarios, you'll see some ghosting specially from HUDs, but all you have to do is set the motion plus to a different mode or simply turn it off. I find that smooth and standard are the best. 3D gaming was good and bad, but mostly bad. I tried COD Black Ops, both for the PS3 and 360. It was pretty bad, but not terrible. Again, no balance. When one image was clear, the others were bad. Again, the view point, I found that to get an OK picture, I would have to slide the view point to either +4 or -3, but then again, it was not 100% clear.There you go, this is as much as I can tell you from my own experience with this set. Picture quality in non 3D is simply beautiful. 3D is poor at its best. Could it be the media or the glasses? I can't really tell you, but I can tell you that everything I checked the 3D with, gave me no good results. Samsung's customer support could not help me if their own lives depended on it.I'm keeping the TV, I think the non 3D quality outweights the poor 3D performance by a long stretch. At this price however, you'd expect nothing but good quality. Sadly, this is not the case. If you want a clear picture and high contrast ratio, this a great mid-high range set, there are cheaper LEDs that do not support 3D content, but have lower contrast ratios, except for the c6800, which is very expensive due to its local diming feature, but for me, as long as I don't use the 3D I'm very happy with this TV. Hope this helps.If any of you had the same problem with the 3D and have found a way around it. I'd appreciate any suggestions.

The picture is amazing, *everybody* who sees it is instantly jealous.  Then I tell the to look from the side, and they are again blown away...it's 1\" thick!  I mounted it on a power-tilt wall mount...as soon as it comes on, it tilts down form the wall, and back up when I turn it off.  They sell the mounts on Amazon, but I was in too much a hurry and got it from a local big-box store (for more $). Definitely a great accessory for this set, and at 50 lbs you can use mounts meant for smaller sets (as long as the VESA is right).There are a bunch of apps (which seem to want to \"update\" precisely when I try to show off this feature to my friends...not a great selling point, but if I used the apps more often it wouldn't happen exactly when I was trying to show off!), that are neat and some are quite useful. It was easy to match my set to the different services.  ***Computer required to look up website and enter your tv's unique number before using app***.  Netflix streaming rental app is really nice (although the movies for streaming aren't the newest ones) and I ditched my Blockbuster mail-in service immediately after realizing their app only *sells* movies, no rentals, and the Netflix combo mail and streaming was cheaper anyhow.  The YouTube app is great, have watched lots of those in full screen mode. Weather, traffic, and other stuff too.  I tend to just watch TV on the set most of the time.I bought the 3-D DVD player, too, which seems to have the same apps...so there's too much redundancy for my taste there.  Also, as soon as I turn on the DVD player, it takes over the TV immediately...that blows, sometimes I want to give the DVD a chance to warm up and get staged while I'm watching the end of something else.  No *real* problem, just grab the remote and switch inputs again...but annoying for sure.The sound leaves something to be desired...but what can you expect from a 1\" thick television???  I feed the output to a Samsung soundbar with wireless subwoofer and all is well!Controls are pretty intuitive, all made sense.  The remote is really neat and shiny silver, and there are strange (color a/b/c/d) buttons I have no idea what they do...but I could look it up if I wanted.  They may be macros or something.  The DVD player's remote is similar, and can control some of the TV functionality, too...which I like.3D is...well...there, and still under development by broadcasters.  I haven't done much with that, as there's not that much to do.  I didn't realize some World Cup games were broadcast in 3D, or I would have tried to stand that horrible buzzing sound form those obnoxious horns to see how it looked.  \"Converting\" regular signals to 3-D seems silly, but every now and then you can see an effect.  A basketball game did look 3D-ish, for sure.  The glasses are a bit less comfortable than I'd like, so I prefer to watch in 2D without them on.  As channels are added with 3D, I may change my mind.  The \"kids\" (adult kids) like messing with that stuff.There is something about the picture...it's so High Def, so \"real\", that for a while everything looked like a soap opera.  It's hard to describe what I'm trying to say.  Everything seemed to have that \"soap opera feel\" to it, some stuff was kind of uncomfortable to watch for some reason.  We got over it, I guess, because we don't notice it anymore...but visitors mention how \"real\" things look and I think they are noticing the same thing we used to see.Very happy with decision to buy this from Amazon.  Unit arrived exactly when it was supposed, to.  The delivery guys called in advance, and were very polite.  If I wasn't going to wall-mount it, they would have taken it out of the box and set it up for me.

After finding out that Avatar for PS3 was already made with optional stereoscopic 3d, I had to get my hands on a 3d tv to try this feature out. I also purchased a hdmi 1.4 cable and the rechargable samsung glasses(extremely light and comfortable, 30 hour battery life). I booted up my ps3 and reconfigured my display settings (for some reason, i could only output in 720p???) and started up the game and went into the menu display settings changing it to the side-by-side (sensio) 3d display and did the same with the tv and alas, the menu was displayed in 3d. You are able to configure how much \"pop\" effect you want out of your 3d from the game menu and the tv menu. I've played about 10 hours of the game and I've enjoyed every minute of it. You can immediately see the depth of the game from the jump, but it's not until you get further into the game where you are standing on what seems like 300 ft ledges to realize the effect that depth perception can have. Eyestrain wasn't that big of a problem for me(wore glasses for 12 years and contacts for the last 12). Initially, your eyes may take 5-10 minutes adjusting to what your seeing, but the more time that went by, the more comfortable my eyes seemed to become. Overally, from a gaming standpoint, I can't wait for the 3d games coming in the future.As far as the issues I read about in other reviews, this \"escaping light\" issue was non existent for me when watching movies on my ps3. I still can't figure out what that reviewer is seeing. The picture is rich and the blacks are amazing(almost as if the tv was off). I enjoyed the remote as well. While the buttons don't \"pop\" out, they are optionally backlit and do have brail-like surfaces that while allow you to familiarize yourself with them in time.

I was mostly interested in the downloadable apps and the picture quality.  3D wasn't a primary concern.I was very concerned as to how glare would affect the picture as I have a south-facing wall of glass behind the viewer that is a real issue in the winter when the sun is low and we are watching football. I had a second generation plasma that was 8 years old and the glare could be enough to force us to TIVO the games and watch them at night.Well, we bought the 55 inch model and wow, what a picture.  It is significantly better than the plasma that we had before.  Individual blades of grass stand out perfectly.  When the screen is black, the set is a mirror and the glare is significant, but once a non-black picture comes on, the set is capable of reducing the glare to only a very minor issue.  This was really beyond what we had hoped for.We were pleased to find out that the set automatically detected DVDs in our SONY player and switched to the DVD source when one starts to play.  My wife is more than a bit technophobic, so less remote fiddling is good.The apps/widgets are very nice.  You get both the Samsung apps and Yahoo apps, so there is quite a variety.But, and I do mean a big BUT, these are not the coolest thing on the set.  Samsung has included a full implementation of DLNA, I think for the first time this year.  What is DLNA and what does it matter? It is a fancy set of intials (Digital Living Network Alliance, if it matters) that are a standard for devices accesing data on other computers.In my house I have a network device that I store videos and music on for the house.  I had a dedicated Media Center computer next to my TV to play movies from this and the TV was essentially a display for the computer.  Now, the TV gets the files all by itself and the computer is no longer necessary.  Essentially, the TV can show a movie on another computer by itself.Other sets have been able to have PCs play the movie on them using an early version of DLNA, but now you can use your remote to play movies without messing with the computer.  This may sound techy, but it is really nice and my wife loves it.  Home movies and stored DVDs can be pulled up with just a couple clicks of the remote.The DLNA was easy to set up.  You can download and run a program from Samsung on a Windows machine or run any other DLNA server program on your mac, LINUX or whatever computer.  Then you go to the TV and it automatically finds the computer(s) and shows the files. I have a Netgear NAS and it had its own DLNA program that worked first try.All in all, this is as good of a TV as I could have hoped for.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not recommended for dark room viewing", "Author": "C.

However, as other reviewers have pointed out, this set has a tragic flaw: the backlighting on dark screens.  In a light room, the picture quality is stellar -- 5-star for sure.  Amazing resolution, very bright, accurate colors (not by default, more on that later) and excellent motion.  No soap opera effect when LED Motion Plus and Auto Motion Plus are deactivated.  I'm in love.In a dark room, however, things are completely different.  The black sections of the screen are very obviously showing backlight through.  There is some overall grey cast that gets a bit more prominent at all four corners.  In a dark \"theater\", this is a 3-star picture.  The colors, motion and resolution are all there, but the deep inky blacks are not.I am keeping this TV, however, because I don't think you can do better for the price. I looked at many other brands & models and anything significantly better is 30-50% more expensive.  The Panasonic VT25 series sets are shockingly good but in addition to being much pricier, they're very thick relative to the super-svelte Samsung.In order to get the picture in line, start with Standard or Movie and take the backlight way down.

I don't understand what the deal is with those reviews but I have not seen any of these issues.  I haven't seen any clouds and there is zero light leaking from the edges.  Yes local dimming sets might deliver better performance, but I doubt it is worth the extra money.  I have lived with a 42 inch Samsung Plasma 720p for the last few years, and a Sharp LED in the bedroom and this TV is light years ahead of them.  Replacing an old 55 inch Philips LCOS rear projection TV so obviously this thing kicks its tired butt.  TV looks great and was very simple to set up.  Colors are spectacular.  Black levels are fantastic, and I love the 240hz Clear Motion feature.  Now if you're a serious film buff and videophile it might annoy you, but I think it looks great.  I keep it on for movies and it gives a very 'super-real' effect which I love.  If you turn it off, you will definitely notice some judder but not too bad.So far my only complaint is that the optical audio output provides at best 2ch stereo.  I have a two year old Onkyo receiver that I use which does have HDMI, but does not support the return audio channel (HDMI 1.4).  So if you want to watch any Internet video on this TV and get the sound back to the amp, you will be limited to 2ch Stereo as there is no HDMI output from this TV.  Not a problem with Netflix (yet).  My amp then has to change sources and it is very annoying to me, but I'm not willing to upgrade the amp just yet, its only 1 year old.  That being said, Samsung themselves say that receivers that do not support 1.4HDMI will not render the 3D effect.  I can definitively say that that is not the case with mine.  Running the Blu-ray player through the receiver and 3D is working fine.  Internet apps work fine, though would be nice to have a flip out keyboard on the remote to enter text when using them.  Pecking out letters with the number pad is just dreadful.UPDATE:After having lived with this TV for a while there are a couple of minor issues.  I do see the clouding that some folks mentioned but it is very minor to me and only under certain conditions.  It only appears watching SD programming.  The TV does struggle a bit with certain patterns occasionally also but not enough to be an issue.  The 3D is cool for about 5 minutes, then I just don't care that much.  It worked very well though.

Well, I've owned this HDTV for about one month and have watched about a half dozen \"3D\" movies on it. Yes, the 3D effect is impressive \"BUT\" I actually \"PREFER\" the 2D-to-3D conversion effects more than the actual 3D blu-rays. Why? Because the full 3D movies are too deliberate with the effects. I mean that images \"jump\" out of the screen for a \"WOW factor\". Hey, I am not looking for \"oohs and ahhhhs\"!

I have been \"SO IMPRESSED\" with watching normal 2D movies, converted to 3D, that I \"HAD\" to write this review to share my experience.

I'm more of an audiophile than videophile, but all things considered this TV has been very pleasing. First off I'd like to go through what has bugged me about it after I made my purchase.Cons:1. Backlight Bleeding/clouding. Technically it isn't true back lighting, but LED Edge lighting which is partly to blame. Like other reviewers have stated there is some clouding/bleeding, but only in extremely dark scenes, when you have the back-light up midway or above there is bleeding/clouding. I've almost never seen it when watching actual content. It's most visible when there is no source on and the screen is blank while in a dark room. I don't watch with the back light up very high, because it's not needed in the room I watch in.2. Black Levels. This will depend in part on the content/source you are using, but also on your viewing environment and correct TV Calibration. I've used the Spears & Munsil High-Definition Benchmark Blu-ray Disc Edition [Blu-ray] to calibrate mine and I am very pleased with the results, except the black levels. There is what's called 'Black Crush' when you lose the detail in darker/black areas. This varies with content as well, I haven't seen much at all with Bluray sources, but with something that is encoded at a lower bit rate (compressed) such as HD Cable/Netflix/Hulu/Standard DVD/Digital Copies of Movies, it is very noticeable, but this is due largely to compression when content is re-encoded to save bandwidth.3. Placement of the HDMI Ports. I don't like that the ports come out of the TV sideways/horizontally. This puts strain on the ports and your HDMI cables. I would have preferred ports that are vertically placed. It also looks weird having a few HDMI cable coming out of the side of your TV. You might potentially need longer cables because of the placement of the ports as well.4. 240Hz Auto Motion Plus/Clear Motion Rate. This is just weird. I read some reviews on it and thought that people were just being picky. I turned it off when I saw what it does. It makes things move so smooth that everything appears robotic and just wrong. Google: 'Motion interpolation' if you want to know more about this feature. I highly recommend you keep it off if you want to enjoy the content you're watching.5. The remote. It's not the button layout that I don't like. And again I thought people were being picky when they said they didn't like it at all. It's just that the buttons are flat, and there is little to no feedback when you press them. It makes it really hard to use the remote without looking at it. Yes it has a backlight, which is nice, but even with the backlight it's not easy to use this remote.6. Judder. I won't go into very much detail, but like most HDTVs in it's price range this one also has a few issues with Motion Judder. It has some settings that can help with this, but I honestly haven't found it to be a problem with most content I watch.Now onto what I liked:1. Design. I think that it is a beautiful HDTV. Very sleek and sexy. My old HDTV was a DLP and it took up a lot of space front to back. This is such a breath of fresh air having such a thin HDTV. It makes it easier to manage cables and add peripherals.2. Viewing Angel. I was hesitant in purchasing another LCD HDTV because they don't have very good viewing angels when compared to Plasma HDTVs. I'll admit that the viewing angle isn't the best ever, but I have no complaints about it at all. It's so far above and beyond what I've had before that I don't care if there is a slight color change at a 30/40 degree angle. It would have been awesome to have some integrated IPS technology, but I didn't want to pay extra for things that I don't really need. Who really wants to watch their TV from that far of an angle anyway.3. Picture Quality. It's not Plasma, but it's still amazing. Even on our Cable HD it looks great. The first thing my father noticed was that he could see the individual hairs coming out of peoples ears. It's easy to see scars and the pores on peoples faces among other minute details that can make some movies look different than before.4. The Apps. I don't really use any of them because I have other devices I use for content and streaming. It's nice to have them available if they are ever needed. Now if you have Amazon Prime you can get movies streamed to your TV free as well. I will say that all the apps work and are fun, but I never use them.5. The Features. 3D isn't my favorite thing, but playing Black-Ops or Killzone 3, among other games that support 3D, has been really fun. There isn't an enormous amount of 3D content to choose from, but watching what is available has been fun. I obtained a copy of Avatar in 3D and it was stunning on this TV.6. Performance. I am very pleased with how well everything works. The TV Starts up quick and shuts down quick as well. There are fine grain controls for calibration, which really help when you want to calibrate the TV well and amateur or professional could calibrate this TV because there are simple and advanced options. In very bright rooms there is always going to be glare, but I was surprised with how well this TV handles glare. I turn off any post processing features because they can introduce lag while video gaming.Conclusion:Overall it's the best TV I have ever owned. I would highly recommend it. If you want something better then try the higher models. The benefits are that you get local dimming/true back lighting that isn't just LED Edge lighting, better black levels and a better dynamic contrast ratio. The local dimming/true back lighting tends to be more uniform and produce less clouding/bleeding, but it's more expensive.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture, good 3D, with some lingering issues", "Author": "Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "ReviewID": "R2QP88NBU3OPVG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I chose this Samsung TV not because of the 3D capability (although that novelty is fun) but because of the high-quality picture and Samsung's reputation.  I also loved the ultra-slim design -- barely over an inch thick and extremely lightweight, especially given its screen size -- and the ability to stream Netflix and to browse internet TV, either through the Samsung Apps or the Yahoo widgets.  The only thing that gave me pause was the fact that Wi-Fi is not built-in and that I would have to buy a Samsung LinkStick to achieve that.  Heck, even lower-end Vizio offers built-in Wi-Fi.  In the end, though, I was swayed by what I saw in a brick-and-mortar store and by a promotion that sweetened the deal.  I felt that I was getting the best set for the money, with or without 3D.But it took me a while to get there.I passed over Vizio, primarily because I had read that Vizio had quality-control issues, and the Panasonic because I didn't think the picture was as good as Samsung's; however, my first Samsung set arrived with only two out of the four HDMI ports operational, a defect that I never would have discovered if I had plugged my cable box and Blu-Ray player into the other two HDMI ports.  And I got an occasional green screen in the middle of viewing -- again, not acceptable.  Fortunately, Amazon's return policy for TVs is excellent, although it took another week to get a fully functioning set.  Although my phone conversation with Samsung customer service was pleasant enough (they suggested that I return the set ASAP), I began to suspect that quality-control is perhaps not what it should be at Samsung, especially given its reputation as being one of the top TV manufacturers.My replacement TV works great most of the time, with one notable problem:  I intermittently get a black screen for a couple of seconds (no audio, no video).  From an online search, I conclude that it may be an issue with how the TV processes HDMI signals or interpolates for 240Hz.Next, I had to get over the \"soap opera effect\" look of a 240Hz set.  I hadn't fully understood that HD TV content is input at only 60 Hz (don't get upset when your set says that the signal is only 60 Hz -- there's nothing wrong) and that the computer interpolates additional frames to accommodate the faster refresh rate.  This creates a look that resembles video tape footage, much the way soap operas look.  My husband claims that it makes the picture look more real.  I feel that it looks more artificial.  In any case, if you want to view 3D Blu-ray discs, you'll need at least a 240Hz set, so you'll have to get used to this look no matter which 3D manufacturer you choose.  It took me a couple of weeks, but now I don't notice the difference unless there's a sustained close-up of someone's face.People have commented on corner lighting due to the specific LED technology used.  I have seen this only on black letterbox screens, and it didn't bother me because it didn't interfere with the image.  To me, this happens so infrequently that it's a non-issue; however, if you think it'll drive you crazy, even if you see it only once in a while, look to another brand or model.You'll have to adjust the settings on the TV to find the look that you like.  While the default settings will be acceptable or even great for most people, you should test out various settings.  For instance, we like the extra brightness that the dynamic setting adds.  And the standard auto motion is fine.  But some people with prefer the standard picture setting with, say, the smooth motion.  This depends on both your viewing environment and what you are watching.  (If you turn off the auto motion, you won't get as much of the soap opera effect, but you will get more jerky movement.)  Don't overlook the settings available to you since the right ones will likely make you a happier customer.Although I hate to admit it, one of my favorite aspects of this set is the remote.  It is sleek, slender, and has touch controls instead of buttons sticking up.  You can easily change to 3D mode or access Yahoo widgets or go to Internet TV or switch input sources . . . a whole range of functions.  It also controls your Samsung Blu-Ray player.So what about the 3D?  First, remember that you'll need a 3D Blu-ray player to see content shot in true 3D as well as active shutter glasses manufactured by Samsung or by a compatible manufacturer.  (Glasses are not interchangeable among brands.)  Changing the 2D TV source to 3D merely pops the foreground, kinda like the greeting cards with cutouts on springs.  But watching a real 3D Blu-ray disc works great, albeit not perfectly since you'll likely see some flickering in the corner of your glasses.  I also found that the 3D effect is much better on films originally shot in 3D rather than films, such as the first 3 Shrek movies, that have been remastered.  Unfortunately, there isn't much available content as of this writing, especially since production studios have signed exclusivity deals for certain films, making Avatar in 3D unavailable until 2012 for Samsung owners and Shrek 4 unavailable for a while to Panasonic owners.  This limited availability of true 3D films may kill the 3D trend, so make sure you are buying a set for its 2D features and picture before you consider its 3D capabilities.Items you may want to consider when buying this set:  AmazonBasics High Speed HDMI Cable (make sure you get an HDMI cable that supports 3D); Shrek 3D Starter Kit, Black or, individually, Samsung 3D Glasses; Samsung 3D Blu-ray Player; Samsung LinkStick Wireless Adapter (if your router is in the same room, you can hardwire your set and player); and a \"show off\" 3D film such as IMAX: Under the Sea.Update: Due to the black screen issue, my recommendation is to wait until this TV gets the appropriate firmware to solve this problem.

I have dirct tv in HD. and some of the HD channels are like blueray quality.point being, if you get a good signal or feed to the tv, it will give you an awsome picture. you do get glare in a bright room so you do need to close the blinds during the day. the 3D part is nothing to brag about, even my kids 7&9 yrs old who normally likes this kind of stuff don\"t really care for watching in 3D. I think that says alot. they thru in the 3D features during the sale, otherwise I'd be really disappointed. the delivery part was pretty disappointing as well. maybe cause it was the holidays and they had alot of deliveries. but if thats the way they are normally, then they suck! all in all I definetly would buy this tv again for the price that i got. 2G.and they threw in all the 3d stuff.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simply Brilliant", "Author": "A.

It would have been nice if you could hear music in the background while viewing pictures etc.. Agree with some of the other customers thou, on the remote control you can not feel the keys, it's pretty uniform, you actually, have to look at keys when pressing but, it's kinda cool remote, looks pretty sexy, reminded me of some of the Apple products.

Swarvar", "ReviewID": "R37NMP3KVSGHG3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I didn't buy this TV through Amazon, but I do own it and I do buy a LOT from them so I figured I would share my thoughts on the UN55C7000.  First, I've seen a lot of the complaints that other reviewers have about the TV and a couple of them I see/have and a couple I don't.  I don't see light shining through the frame like some reviewers mentioned, but I did notice that in very dark scenes at night I can tell a bit of a difference in black level in the center as compared to areas closer to the edges.  I also notice the \"clouding\" and pixelization in blacks from time to time.  I don't know if this is more attributed to the TV or the signal being broadcast (or maybe a combination of the two).  Getting things tuned in a bit better may help clear it up a bit though; plenty of settings to toy with.  I am a bit dismayed by the relative lack of connection options on the TV.  If you have older devices that don't support HDMI and don't have a receiver, your in for some trouble!  My receiver doesn't do HDMI switching and nearly all my devices use HDMI (DirecTV, PS3, Samsung 3D BD player) so I was ok overall.  Be aware that there is only 1 component video input and 1 composit input.  Last of the gripes is with the QC process for the display itself.  Right out of the box I noticed a stuck pixel (green).  It was extremely annoying so I took the TV back and exchanged it for another one.  I understand that this is/was a common thing in the past, but I wasn't willing to have a $3,000 TV have an issue day 1 if I could avoid it.  Got the 2nd TV home and guess what?  Green stuck pixel again.  In the same region as well (middle of the TV right of center approaching the frame).  Going 2 for 2 with stuck pixels I decided to live with it this time since the next one I figured very well may have the same issue (or more of them).  Samsung even mentions stuck or dead pixels are normal in the user manual.  When you are talking 2,073,600 pixels (1920 * 1080) with 6,220,800 sub-pixels (2,073,600 pixels * 3 sub pixels) I guess it's probably nearly impossible to make something perfect with those numbers.Enough of the gripes.  Overall this TV is fantastic.  I am very impressed by the design (it looks sweet!), how thin it is, how light it is, the touch sensitive controls, the classy looking remote with backlight, etc.  I just wish they would have included the wall mount with the TV for this price.  If you've seen the wall mount, you'd wish the same thing.  The picture is crisp and vivid, and the 3D is fantastic!  I hope more 3D content comes along so we can really enjoy the TV.  The 2D to 3D conversion works ok, it adds some depth you probably weren't expecting.  But you still can't beat programming that was created in 3D!  I eveen played some Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 with the 3D on.  I can't say if it helped me or hurt me online, lol.  What I can say is that out of the box if you try to play a game like that with the 3D feature on, you get horrendous lag.  Not from the game, but from the TV.  When looking or aiming it took some time for the screen to respond to my wishes.  It wasn't jerky, the motion was still smooth.  Just delayed.  Turning off dynamic contrast, 240hz, etc. seemed to help or eliminate the lag.I can't say how the speakers on this particular TV as I don't use them.  I have the TV connected to my receiver and listen to the TV with surround sound.In the end I'm happy we bought the TV.  It's not flawless, but what is and at what price?  At around $3,000 this TV certainly isn't cheap, but it is still relatively in-expensive compared to higher-end equipment.  Over all I think a more appropriate price point for this TV should be a little north of $2,000.  My wife and I jumped on this because of the great package deals going around (TV+3D BD player+glasses for around $2,700) or we would have waited for prices to come down and 3D to mature a little.  At any rate, I'd recommend this TV to someone that was in the market for one.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV!", "Author": "Susan Chan \"Y Carebear\"", "ReviewID": "R2AZWDNW8XP5Z5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this new TV! My boyfriend and I were debating which TV to buy for our new place and this was one of the 3 TVs we considered. (The other 2 were Samsung plasmas). Through process of elimination we chose this one. Amazon had such a great deal for this TV when we bought it (about $900 less than retail) and it was relatively new to the market. The picture quality is amazing! Whatever that shows on the screen look so real! The couple things I dislike about the TV (but does not take away the brownie points away from this) are (1) that the sound isn't as loud. When we watch a movie we had to increase the volume to almost max to fully hear the dialogues of movies so we bought a sound system for our house. Number 2 is that (my opinion) the lighting of the TV depends on the lighting of the room. If the room is dark the TV screen will be dimmer. If the room is bright it will light up. For me, I didn't like this feature because it wasn't bright enough for my liking so we had to keep some lights on in order for me to stay lighted and not dim.

Unfortunately in June, a kid's toy flew across the living room and hit the TV in a manner to render it finished for good (un-repairable).I was very excited in 2010 when I got this set.  Good color, nice big picture, and the 240 HZ auto motion plus really improved watching sports.  The automotion plus did need to be manually disabled to watch regular TV, movies, or non-sports Blu-Rays.  My family commented that it smoothed out movies too much and was inducing nausea.  Made you feel like you were \"on Set\", which sounds cool, but totally removed the cinema atmosphere.The APPS were fun too; however, typing in words with the remote was time consuming.The bad:1)  In a darkened room, the edge bleed of light is very noticeable.  We were unable to watch the set with the lights completely off.  It was that distracting.2)  Glare.  With too much light, you would see a lot of reflections from the room on the screen.3)  The glasses.  Although the glasses were purchased separately, our family needed three adult pairs, and one kids' pair.  I was shocked to see that my nearly $350 dollars invested in the glasses is useless.  The 2012 models use a completely different setup, and my glasses are useless.  I inquired with Samsung if I could trade them in since the newer glasses they make are much less expensive.  NOTHING!  It was my problem that I ran out and bought the first model 3d set!  Our $$$ in 2010, when the technology was brand new, cannot be used anymore.  It is only two years and it was shocking that they would not trade $350 worth of glasses in for 4 pair (for 2012) that now cost less than $100 for all 4.4)  Although I was mad I just lost my nearly $2000 investment, I wasn't as mad as I thought.  I was actually a little happy that I would be able to now get a set that we could watch in the dark.We took our business to PANASONIC and bought a 55\" VT50 plasma.  So far, the plasma looks great, but it is dimmer.  The plasma does great in low light though.Every set, except the new Panasonic, is a Samsung LED LCD or regular LCD in our home.

The high def quality is exceptionally good. I think Samsung LCDs beat anyone else's LCDs when it comes to pure picture quality. And the bezel is very stylish and thin (though I would have preferred a traditional black stand to this new silver one).However, there is room for improvmemnt. I do notice some flashlighting from the corners as other reviews have mentioned. It's not terrible and turning the backlight down to 7 helps. It is most noticeable in dark scenes when viewed off angle. I actually bought this TV for my parents house, and I don't think they've even noticed this flashlighting effect. If you don't know to look for it, you might never notice it.This TV also does not have true local dimming like the 8000 series does. Instead this TV dims or brightens all the backlights simultaneously. Local dimming would have been nice, but that feature probably isn't worth the extra $400 that Samsung charges for it.As far as the audio on this TV, it's pretty good but not great. I assume that is because now that these new LED TVs are so thin, the bottom facing internal speakers can't really function as well.For the price Amazon is charging, this TV is a very good buy.

I spent quite a bit of money on this tv because it was supposed to have an excellent auto motion plus feature.  Unlike many others, I love the \"soap opera effect\" created by motion smoothing, and I was extremely pleased with the result I received by turning this feature on with the standard and smooth settings.  However, it didn't take long for me to notice a stutter, lag, skip, whatever you want to call it, when the feature is on.  I could notice this happening every twenty seconds at the best and every two seconds at the worst with all sources (standard definition, hi definition, and dvd player hooked up with both hdmi cables and component cables).  With auto motion plus turned off this was not an issue.I researched online and found out a lot of other Samsung owners were having the same problem (but I couldn't find anyone complain about this happening with the UNC7000 series).  I did the firmware update hoping that it would fix the problem.  The firmware update actually made the problem worse, and to add insult to injury took away most of the \"soap opera effect\" that I originally had with the tv.  The smooth setting is not nearly as strong as it was, and only when I do the custom setting with both the judder and motion blur reducers turned all the way up can I get closer to the motion smoothing that my tv had before the update, although it still isn't really close.  I'm left with a tv that is unbearable to watch with auto motion plus turned on, which was the only reason I paid the extra money for this tv.  I'm disappointed that the update didn't help, that Samsung would tone down the \"soap opera effect\" in their firmware updates with no regard for customers who may have enjoyed this feature, and ultimately, I am wondering if anyone else with this tv has had the same problems?

Sure I wish it were a little cheaper but sometimes you have to pay for quality.Final thoughts, I think 3D is a gimmick and a lot of people including my wife bought into it. In a few years new TV's will be out with 3D capability that do not require glasses but in the mean time, this is the only option. 3D aside, this TV is loaded with extra options including the ability to download apps. The internet capability is a great bonus and we take advantage of it. It also allows for firmware updates.

The polarizing of the glasses helped mask my next horror. I change inputs to my Sony CX690 and load up Avatar.  It looks pretty good until I hit a dark scene and not only notice every feature in my living room being reflected back to me, even in a fairly dark room. There is also some really harsh light coming from the corners, and cloudiness akin to sitting at 175\u00b0 off angle looking at the Vizio with local dimming on. I change to an anamorphic movie and oh the horror.  Light bleeding from every corner, clouds bleeding into the black bands, just terrible.  I opened the shades and curtains, turned on the lights in the room and sat down to give it one last try in a typical non movie night situation.  I made it about 30 minutes into last weeks survivor from the U-verse DVR playing with every setting I could, then decided that I had enough.  I boxed it up, loaded in the truck and took it back.Why not the 8500?  The bezel is hideous to me, and after seeing the glossy screen of the C7000 I'm not interested in another glossy screen.Pros:Slim and SexyDLNA (took no time at all to get some movies playing from my HTPC and main rig)Better internet app selection than VizioGreat color reproductionCons:Poor 3d implementation, bad shutter lag(your eyes catch the shutter opening and closing leaving glimpses of black)mediocre soundannoying glossy screenbleeding lightcloudy lighting240hz motion smoothing mutes the picture making 1080i look pretty terrible.Bottom line.  I think Samsung needs to try again. It's sad when a TV that is significantly cheaper from a \"no name\" company outclasses it on almost every front except the ability to watch monsters versus aliens in 3d(a poor attempt at 3d at that) :pI think I will wait for the Vizio Pro 72\" later this year.  While my Vizio 552 isn't perfect and doesn't have 3d, it will get me by until someone can take a better stab at 3d and pique my interest again.I was tempted to give this 1 star, but between price I paid, shear sexiness, and good geek toys I had to give it a little bump.", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Should be cheaper for the quality of the TV", "Author": "takara", "ReviewID": "R220ICFZ0Q0S7M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "big cloud issue when play dark movies.Internet is kinda useless.

Like many of the reviewers I was able to land a package deal (BR DVD, Starters kit and the 55 7000 series).  At the store, using their promo and 3D feeds, I have to admit the TV looked sharp and good.Well when I received the TV and was able to set it up side by side using HD signal from TWC, only then I could see some gross differences between the two sets.  My take (Pro's and Con's) are listed below.  Needless to say after several days of careful comparison, I returned the 7000. Frankly it was disappointing to me. Also I should say that to those 1st time HDTV buyers this TV should yield a very positive experience but to those with calibrated eyes, the 7000 at best will be an average TV.LED advantagesBright vivid colors - LED (++), LCD (+ & \u00bd)) - LED presents brighter colors compared to LCD, especially on live sport action.Crispness of details in static and very slow motion scenes - LED (++), LCD (+) - (LED's high contrast ratio shows its superior capability vs. LCD)3D effect - LED (+), LCD (NA).  Generally good but some ghosting effect and colors and picture are somewhat faded/washed out.LED Short comingsBlack depth level - LED (+), LCD (+ & 1/2) - Black on LED looked artificial and I had issues seeing the detailsBlack uniformity - LED (-,-,-), LCD (++) (LED - Lots of light bleeding through, especially at the edgesCrispness of details fast motion scenes - LED (-,-), LCD (+) - LED's  240 Hz software  specially when set at Standard and Smooth, makes the senses look plasticy and artificialJitter and jerk - LED (-,-), LCD (+) - Significant amount of Jerk and jump were noted in  many of the movies and shows.  Only way to minimize it was to put Motion Plus at clear but then the picture looked TOO jitterySynchronization of picture and sound via HDMI - LED (-), LCD (+).  With LED TV, often the HD picture, especially when system is 1st turned on was flickering and sound and picture did not synchronize well. This was not the case when watching standard channels.Wet Look - LED (-), LCD (++) - With the LED, the picture looked more like a monitor and 2 dimensional and dry, while the LCD seemed much more fluid  with depth and natural", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "AMAZING 3D HDTV AND LED 1080P HDTV!

Leetham must be the biggest perfectionist in the world.  I'm a HUGE perfectionist when it comes to HDTV's and owned the UN55B8500 before this one and must say... THIS TV ROCKS!The quality of the UN55C7000 is almost exactly the same with only minor blooming of colors when the screen is completely dark.  I also see what Andrew is talking about with the LED edge-lighting issue... But honestly, it doesn't ruin my viewing experience AT ALL!  As for the 3D issue, Andrew is only speculating his own opinion on that.  I honestly can't say whether the edge-lighting will effect 3D cause you can't yet, the glasses are not available for purchase!I have to tell you though going from the UN55B8500 to this set wasn't really that hard for me, PLUS, when those 3D glasses come out I'm hoping all these truly minimal glitches which Andrew is making a big deal about will all dissolve.  I am a HUGE Samsung fan and trust that they have put the time and energy into this television to truly make my jaw drop when those 3D glasses become available.  This T.V. also added a few really cool features for the new year so to give it a 3 star rating is WAAAAAY harsh.I gave it a 5 just for being able to hold it's own next to the UN55B8500.  The only slight issue is the edge-lighting, which incidentally, isn't even a HUGE deal or a deal breaker to non-perfectionists.  It's an amazing TV which I feel should be welcomed with open arms from any tech savvy individual who loves new technology!P.S.  *****UPDATE*****JUST WENT TO BEST BUY TO TEST OUT THE 3D ON MONSTERS VS ALIENS, IT'S AMAZING!  DON'T BELIEVE ME?  GO TO YOUR NEAREST BEST BUY AND CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF!  YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY!  IT'S SERIOUSLY EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN THE 3D IN THE MOVIES!

There is a major reason why all retailers are overstocked on these LCDS. Apparently, many consumers are reporting bright corner backlight bleeding, clouding and flashlight effects during viewing of 16 x 9 letterbox movies especially during dark/night scenes.  To test this, watch a letterbox movie and turn the backlight to max and see the corners.  Also, the TVs using LED backlight are not as bright (lumens) as the CCF-Bulb backlit LCDs.If you do your research right, you will see most people are currently buying plasmas with 600HZ refresh rate and .001ms response time with 7,000,000:1 contrast ratio (Samsung pn58c8000).  Plasma HDTVs have been around for a while and they have improved it a lot, especially the burn-in disadvantage corrected by pixel rotation.
