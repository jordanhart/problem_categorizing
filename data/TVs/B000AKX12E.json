Bulb life of 100-800 HOURS(2-5 months) is expected, even the replacements from Toshiba.  Mine lasted 53 days!  Replacement parts are NOT currently available and even if they were you would need another one very soon.  I wouldn't buy a Toshiba Rear projection until 2007.If you have one now you WILL have this problem.  Do what I did.  Return you TV and exchange for another brand.  Even if you are outside your stores return policy, Toshiba has return contracts with all the major retailers, get an R/A number form Toshiba (1-800-631-3811) they can authorize a return to the retail store and get you watching a new HDTV before Football season begins.  Be nice, courteous and firm with these customer service people and  you will get what ever you deserve.  Toshiba is flexible in these situations.

On mine, there was a circle about 10\" in diameter that you can see in certain lighting and even when the TV is off!  It will appear lighter than the surrounding areas at times and can be annoying.  I called Toshiba and had a service man come out and even though he acknowledged that this is common, Toshiba will not replace the screen.  I would have given them a negative 10 if it were possible just because of their attitude.  So, look at the screen VERY carefully before accepting or purchasing.  If you see this problem, refuse to accept it.

The original bulb burned out in late January just under 5 months after purchase of the TV  I guess that's actually pretty good - I'm reading from others bulbs only lasting 2 months on light use!  I love the quality of the picture when the bulb is working.  It's very sharp and clear.  But starting a few weeks before the bulb burns out, the picture dims considerably then eventually just gives up the ghost!  The replacement bulb lasted almost exactly 5 months and burned out last Friday night.  Same process - several weeks of dim picture the poof!  Gone.  I've put in a call to the authorized service center and am awaiting a call back.  I am single and don't have the TV on all that much - a couple of hours in the evening and a few more on weekends - and I always use it in the low setting (this TV has a low for normal night viewing and high for daytime when ambient light may cause difficulty in viewing - a problem I've never had.)

Bulb blew in November.  Second bulb just blew (waiting for replacement now).  Toshiba rep says we're getting an \"improved lamp\" rated for 4000-6000 hours, which is what they said last time - Apparently the bulb that just blew was also one of the \"improved\" lamps.  I told them to mark my file as I'd likely be calling again in 4-6 months.  Toshiba rep said if it blew a 3rd time, we could discuss \"other options\".  The TV is on about 4-6 hours a day (little ones love their cartoons) on average over the \"life\" of the TV.  We have an XBOX, a PS2 and a HDMI DVD player connected to the TV inputs.  Cable box also connected through HDMI cable.  (Tried a cable card from Comcast, but the channels were delayed - 5 secs - in changing.)  Fiber optic running over to a receiver as well.  We also have a second antenna connected.  The picture is good when it's on and the sound is really good, but aside from the bulb issues, we've also experienced problems with the card reader not operating (tech had to be called to service the unit) and off and on green and black squares bouncing in place of the picture at times (not the digital signal blocks).  All were reported to Toshiba.  Toshiba cust service has been responsive and worked with us on the phone, but $2500 (what I paid last year) is a lot for an off and on again TV.

Thank goodness the TV is still under the manufacturer's warranty. The part was ordered from Toshiba 2 weeks ago and it is still on back order with no definate timeframe for shipping.

Every day. I believe people who have a bad experience with an expensive product are more vocal than those who are pleased... Thats the reason for so many bad reviews.

We did experience a dead bulb very early on and Toshiba warranty replaced the bulb plus added 2 years to the warranty. Since that bulb, we've not had to replace it. The TV does have some peculiar behaviors, like the fans running all the time or the occasional no antenna signal for HD channels (yes, over the air). We paid $2400 back in 2006 for this and it's still a relative bargain for the size to cost ratio. In short, it's a great 1080i TV for the size, cost and function. The picture is great and it's been hanging on for about 3 years now. I just wish DLP was still as readily available, LCD and Plasma is just too high cost for the size - and frankly DLP works great.
