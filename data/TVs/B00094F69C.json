Doesn't have all the bell's and whistle's associated with higher end t.v.'s but who cares.

I would not recommend it if you are just planning on watching regular cable and you have no HD box to let it live up to its full potential. The picture quality is better on a regular analog TV if you are hooking up to straight cable. I have had this TV for 2 months now and the only flaw that I can find is that the sound quality is not the best.  I hooked it up to my stereo and unfortunately the power of the TV is so weak that even turning it up all the way I wasn't able to get it to a listening level that was acceptable. That really bummed me out.  It actually sounds better when I just don't plug it into an exteranl source for sound. Other than that it is very light, you can hang it on the wall and its actually a great size for a bedroom tv.  I have it out in my living room now and its too hard to see if you are too far away from it. You are suppose to be able to hook it up to a computer as a monitor but I have not tried it yet.  According to reviews I read before buying, it wasn't a good monitor.  I bought it as a TV and it makes a great TV, its very stylish to boot. As long as you don't expect more than a fabulous picture you will be pleased with this product for the price.", "Date": "September 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "simple", "Author": "Liliane Leiser", "ReviewID": "R1VFZKRPEXM110", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this product.

A few nights ago the screen went black. I called tech. support and they said it is dead and out of warranty so I just threw it away. This is what happens when you try to take the cheap way out- you get burned.

Except for the fact that mines is defective it's otherwise perfect. I think the problem is with the black light. Sometimes when I turn on the TV, the picture turns off a second later and only the sound remains. I have to play turning in on and off for the picture to remain.
