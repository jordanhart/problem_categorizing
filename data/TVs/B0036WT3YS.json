{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Set from Samsung", "Author": "elixxxer", "ReviewID": "R3L98YMB7QNX78", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been researching plasma televisions for the last few months in preparation for my first large TV purchase.  It was a painstaking process that eventually lead me to purchase the Panasonic G25.  Because I lived with that TV for about three weeks and have enjoyed the C7000 for the same amount of time, I am poised to compare the two.What first must be addressed is why I chose to return the G25.  Two words: floating blacks.  This is not to be confused with the phenomenon of rising blacks, where over time the ability of the panel to produce deep, dark blacks is diminished (although this afflicts 2010 models, it occurs at a more gradual rate).  \"Floating blacks\" occurs when images on screen change in brightness and the blacks rise and fall as a result.  This represents a significant problem because it is reactionary: when a bright image appears, the blacks do not rise immediately so the effect becomes very obvious and irritating.  Floating blacks have been reported by many, while others swear they either do not exist or are indiscernible.  I found the behavior to be pervasive for all material and absolutely unbearable.  This is unfortunate, because the G25 was fantastic in every other regard: nearly perfect colors out of the box in THX mode, rich blacks with great shadow detail and not a hint of image retention or burn in.  In all of the aforementioned categories, the G25 outperformed the C7000 and makes me wish Panasonic would have their niggles sorted.Onward to the C7000.Overall, I am very pleased with the television.  Aesthetically, it is an extremely striking piece of kit.  The base is a beautiful piece of brushed aluminum (well, it's probably steel, but the finish is brushed), the bezel also sports a brushed finish, which in my opinion is far superior to the glossy bezel of most sets, and the glass-like base support and surround add the finishing touch to a special looking television.The picture quality of this television is great, to be sure.  I find the out-of-the-box colors to be fairly inaccurate and they will be further from true without a professional calibration than the Panasonic.  Black levels are good, although not as a rich as the G25 (pre-rise anyway, that could change after a year or two).  The screen is a bit brighter than the G25 with more color pop and I have had no issues with motion.  The G25 was noticeably grainier, a possible issue if one's normal viewing distance is closer than average (say, closer than 8 feet).  The standard menu allows for far more customization than the Panasonic and there is no need for a non-professional to ever enter the service menu.  The internet widgets are exponentially superior to those offered by Panasonic, but I have so many streamers, media devices etc. that the included Samsung apps are rarely used.There are a couple of things that irk me with the Samsung, none necessarily significant.  Image retention is far more prominent on this set than the Panasonic or my parents' five-year-old Phillips.  A static image left on screen for just a few minutes will result in image retention (and I do have the pixel orbiter set to engage after just one minute).  Luckily, it will disappear within minutes after switching to any content that will get those pixels moving and none of the retention has resulted in burn-in.  I do play games and still detect no burn-in whatsoever.  Also, I did notice a bit of line bleed that I never experienced with the G25, but that seemed to be an isolated incident as I have not observed it again.That segues nicely to my next point of complaint: game mode.  The input lag on this set makes games unplayable in any mode BUT game mode.  This in itself is not an issue, because with game mode engaged, any remaining lag is imperceptible.  The problem stems from a poorly designed menu.  To activate game mode, you must enter the menu, scroll down to services, then click the general setting menu, and then choose on or off.  If input lag is going to suck so much in all other modes, this needs to be a single button-click on the remote.  Moreover, you can't disengage game mode by simply switching picture modes.  Instead, you must again navigate the same asinine menu tree.  Irritating and unnecessary, but at least input lag is perfectly acceptable once in game mode.What many buyers considering this set are probably concerned with is 3D capability.  It is by far the least expensive 3D television currently available and (especially with the present inclusion of a BR player/starter kit combo) is an unbeatable value.  3D on this set is nearly as good as the big boys (read: VT25) with little crosstalk or ghosting.  3D content is sparse at the moment and will continue to be for the foreseeable future (partly because of the exclusive packaging bull malarkey perpetuated by Samsung and the studios themselves; talk about shooting yourself in the foot).  As such, the 2D-3D conversion algorithm is a nice addition and can deliver surprisingly impressive results.  It works well for some content and is insufferable with others, so you will have to experiment and see what works for you.  Some games and animated content seem to respond particularly well.  I recently experimented with native 3D content via the PS3 and was surprised with the results.  Stardust HD and Motorstorm both exceeded my expectations, especially considering they were not initially created with 3D as an objective.  WipeOut, while not nearly as striking (and a medicore game at best), still enjoyed the added benefit of depth afforded by 3D and still yields an appreciable effect.  I should also add that I have experienced no issues whatsoever concerning communication or syncing between the glasses and the television.  Additionally, the glasses are fairly comfortable and having to change a battery every 50 hours is actually preferable in the long run, as opposed to losing the charge with internal units, necessitating a trip to the factory (or refuse bin).A tangential but important note: when the 7000 line of Samsung plasmas was first released, a picture-processing mode called Motion Judder Canceller was engaged and undefeatable.  What this processing actually does is irrelevant: it should be avoided like the plague.  If you choose this set, make sure it has firmware 1026 or later installed or download it immediately if not.  For giggles, I converted my C7000 into a C8000 in the service menu, which activates the option to enable or disable MJC (I do not recommend this as there is no need).  I enabled it and within seconds wanted to gouge my eyes out, it really is that bad.  Make sure MJC is off, forever.  And ever.I suppose this review might come across as somewhat negative.  I have decided to keep the Samsung and am happy to have returned the Panasonic, if that is any indication.  I give a slight edge to the G25 in overall picture quality, so if you do not need/want 3D and do not observe floating blacks - or don't know what the heck I'm talking about (and believe me, ignorance is most definitely bliss here) - I would go for the Panasonic, primarily because it is surprisingly inexpensive for the picture it offers.  Otherwise, the Samsung is a great set and impeccable value considering its feature set and stunning design.  All of the 2010 plasma models have their foibles, it just so happens the C7000 offered the least of them in areas concerning me for the right price.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "One fantasic TV!", "Author": "RedPhillips", "ReviewID": "R323DBS2DSWZ43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is absolutely amazing. The picture quality is top notch, and after demoing several models from panasonic, samsung and LG, I decided for the price this TV included everything I could ever want. I'm extremely pleased with my decision.  After purchasing a Samsung LED in December, I was left somewhat unimpressed. My first HDTV was plasma and after owning a few LCDs and one LED I decided to go back to plasma. I mostly compared Panasonic and Samsung, but also took a brief look at some of LG's LED TVs. It finally came down to the G25 by Panasonic and this TV, the PN50c7000. Picture quality was the most important to me, so that came first. Both TV's looked excellent in HD(Source was star trek BD), but after demoing the two several times I felt the PN50c7000 had the edge. I consulted one of my buddies who is an expert on HDTVs(a professional calibrator)and he broke down the pros and cons of each model. I went with the PN50c7000 and could not be happier. The picture quality is fantastic, with rich colors and very deep blacks. The addition of 3D was also a plus to me, but definitely not one of my priorities. Standard definition also looks amazing, and with TV's these days SD quality can vary drastically from set to set(The G25 was not as great at reproducing SD, one of the deal breakers for me). Finally, the PNc7000 had far more internet capabilities than the G25, which was another added bonus, as well as 3D. Since owning the TV I have tested many sources and it seems to reproduce colors very accurately, and again, has a great contrast.  I would also like to address the issue many have had with this TV, the so called \"soap opera effect\". The first generation models of this TV came preloaded with MJC(the newer ones do not), or motion judder canceller, which made movement look \"fake\" or ghostly when watching from some sources. This is a feature also found of the C8000 series, but for some reason samsung didn't include an option to turn it off on the C7000. Many returned their sets in anger because of this, but its actually a very easy fix. There are several options, the easiest being the game mode option. Switching the game mode from on to off in the general settings will turn this effect off. Do this for each source and no more MJC. Samsung has also issued a firmware update on their website which can be applied via a USB flash drive that will also fix the issue. The last option, which many tech savvy individuals have done, is switch the TV from a c7000 model to an 8000 model via the service menu, which gives you a menu option to turn MJC off. I can confirm that this works, but do so at your own risk. You can potentially brick your TV if you do something wrong. The first two options are extremely easy and safe to perform. Don't return your sets because of this and miss out on a seriously impressive TV.  Overall this TV has it all. An extremely impressive PQ, internet capability and 3D are all present on the PNc7000, with a sleek, slim design to top it off. I would recommend this TV to anyone, and while the Panasonic G25 is also a very impressive TV, my opinion leans toward Samsung this year.Update: There is some image retention on this model that many will notice, including myself. Don't worry, its never permanent. There is a recommended 100 hour break in time with most plasmas, and this is no exception. If the temporary image retention bothers you, make sure you dial down the contrast and especially brightness. Do this for the first 50-100 hours and image retention should slowly become a non issue. For those who don't want to do this, run the scrolling bar across your screen when image retention occurs and it will do the trick. Note: I recently left my screen on pause for 3 hours(forgot to turn it off!) and of course it left quite a bit of burn in. I ran the scrolling bar for 2 minutes and everything went away. Works like a charm.Update #2 : Well, after about eleven months of use(and eleven great months at that) a line of pixels has died in my screen. It is a very small line about 1/3 the way down. I opened the TV up to check all the connections and they were solid, so I have chalked this up as a bad panel. Luckily I bought an extended warranty so BB has ordered the new panel and will send someone to put it in at the end of this week. I'm almost positive Samsung also offers a warranty for at least the first year, but dealing with them will probably be complex and take a much longer amount of time.I briefly searched to see if anyone else has had this issue as well but so far I have found only a few cases. While It is certainly disappointing to have a panel fail after only eleven months, the PNC7000 is still an amazing TV with stunning PQ. I would give it 4 stars, current conditions withstanding. Just thought I would share my experiences even if it is a rare occurrence.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV with a few shortfalls", "Author": "E. Boci", "ReviewID": "R1Q2L095RFI5X5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV as a replacement for an older JVC DLP 1080i set. The colors and details are amazing! Playing PS3 games and blu ray movies on a plasma are everything I've read about. There has been absolutely no blurring during action movies like some LCD's can have. I don't know how it compares to some of the \"industry's finest\" plasmas, like a Kuro, but from what I've seen, the black levels have been superb.I describe myself as a pretty technical person, so I really appreciate all of the adjustments available on the 7000 series. I would liked to have purchased the PN50C8000, with pro calibration controls, but it wasn't available to me at the time I purchased this model.Adding to the geek appeal is the internet functionality. I am able to connect it directly to a LAN cable, so all internet widgets and video streaming are quick and don't lag. Possibly one of the greatest connection feature has to be the USB connection. I have a 1 TB external hdd filled with movies and video. I have only encountered one obscure file format that the TV hasn't been able to play. It will even play .mkv files!There have only been a few downfalls to this TV. From the time I turned it on for the first time, there has been a buzzing noise emitting from the screen. I can't pinpoint the exact location, but you can hear it when you would like to have the volume lower (like when our baby is taking a nap). Apparently this has been an ongoing issue with Samsung TV's, and it seems that I have been one of the latest victims. I am still unsure how I am going to handle this buzz (take it back to Best Buy or call Samsung).This is probably expected with how thin these displays are, but the sound is pretty tinney and doesn't have a lot of quality. Most people will probably want to purchase a sound bar or have a home theater set up, like I do, so it really isn't that big of a deal.The only other thing, which is inherent in plasma screens (no matter what the companies tell you), is burning images. I've read all over the internet that modern plasma displays are not supposed to be susceptible to this problem, but let me tell you, if you leave your DVR paused for more than a few minutes on a bright screen or an image with a prominent network icon (Discovery Channel HD), you will definitely see an image for a little while. The TV has features to minimize or allow the pixels to \"unburn\" itself, but you need to be careful anyways.So far I have really enjoyed the PN50C7000, I would definitely recommend it, but will always caution the buzzing.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice plasma, but...", "Author": "Stephen G. Ayres", "ReviewID": "R2H07YBN2QOYAM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I'll say I'm very satisfied with the TV. Crystal clear HD and very good processing of non-HD signals. Blacks are awesome.  If I had it to do over again, I would purchase the same c7000 model instead of the c8000.However, there are noteworthy items for those shopping:Wireless Internet -For easy-setup wireless Internet use, it requires a separately purchased USB adapter device with the correct plug type. Conveniently, Samsung makes one that you can buy for $50 - $70. In my opinion, Samsung should have put in an internal wireless adapter. What a shame. Would have only cost about 75 cents.To connect my TV to the wireless router, instead of a USB dongle, I used a TrendNet TEW-430APB configured as an Access Point Client which is plugged into the Samsung's Ethernet jack. The TrendNet unit is about $40 and requires a little bit of networking knowledge to configure. This solution might be preferable if you think you will need additional Ethernet connections in the same area as the TV. Additional connections can be made available with the purchase of an Ethernet switch.Image Retention -I expected a little of this.  If you pause an image and leave it for a while, it WILL burn in but only temporarily. There is a scrolling-bar feature that exercises the pixels and removes the image. It will also go away on its own.  Supposedly severe image retention stops happening as the display panel \"cures\".Blurring around the edges -This was a big disappointment for me initially but it has been fixed with sets that have firmware version 1026 and later. Older sets can be updated by doing a firmware update that is described in the downloads/support section of the c7000 page at Samsung's website.This effect is called Motion Judder Cancellation (MJC) and it was very noticeable on images being panned in front of a moving background. If you have the effect (it looks like a watery halo around an object's edge) on your TV, it can be fixed by doing the simple firmware update. You will need a computer with Internet access and a USB thumb drive. In lieu of the firmware update, it can be turned off by turning ON Game Mode and then turning Game Mode OFF while using the particular affected input.I did not buy this set for its 3D capabilities so I cannot comment on that.  3D theater movies are novel but I find even the theater's lightweight glasses cumbersome.  Battery-powered home sets are no doubt heavier.  I wore glasses for the first 35 years of my life - post-LASIK, I'm not going to wear them to watch TV.", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wanna' make your friends Jealous? Buy THIS TV", "Author": "Gift Recipient \"Sleeping in a cold bed\"", "ReviewID": "R11KMJ759FACAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking at an LCD 3D TV but didn't like the price compared to a closely sized Plasma version. After researching the picture quality between LCD and plasma formats, I am convinced that the plasma is by far a better picture. There is far less pixelization with the plasma and the picture is smoother and more lucid. The contrast ratio is 5,000,000:1. I don't think that is attainable with an LCD. In general, this is a GREAT TV. The Amazon price is a steal compared to buying it at Bestbuy. Not having to fork out $90 in Maryland sales tax to our thief Governor gave me even greater satisfaction.In regards to this buzzing sound, either I'm deaf (I lost my hearing the day I got married) or there is no buzzing sound. I'm using the TV speakers and maybe this buzzing sound stems from those people who are amplifying their audio through external speakers. Could be feedback or just bad cables/ connections. The only drawback I have about this TV is all the connections are on the far left edge of the TV panel, not the rear. Since all my peripherals are to the right of the TV I had to purchase longer cables.Not a big deal though I've seen people give bad ratings for reasons like this. Just because they're technically-challenged is no reason to give a TV a bad review.A few other things...For the wireless USB adapter you do not need to use a Samsung brand network adapter. My Linksys wireless-N (WUSB600N model) works with this TV. Be careful in setting up your wireless network adapter. If you use a NON Samsung adapter DO NOT enable the 'Samsung Wireless Link\" in the network settings menu. I accidentally enabled this setting and, for some reason, could not disable it after it recognized the Linksys Adapter. Apparently, this is a software glitch that may be corrected in a future firmware upgrade. I had a \"painless\" chat session with a samsung representative and the only way to correct the problem is to re-set the TV back to it's original manufacturer settings. You won't find these instructions in the Owners Manual. If you ever need to do this, hold down the \"Exit\" button for 20 seconds while pointing it at the TV.Finally.....the 3D. This TV upconverts any 2D broadcast into 3D simply by pressing the \"3D\" button. This is simulated 3D, not true 3D, but there is a noticeable dimensional effect. It's nice but it's more of a novelty and I find that I'm not reaching for those 3D glasses as often as I used to.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great 3D effects!! (but you can wait for more content to release)", "Author": "Attan", "ReviewID": "R3NQWZ40M9R92W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow! I love my new TV. I got this tv 6 days ago. I can't believe how many people asked if I had to always watch in 3D with the glasses on, NO. I have a hard time reading these bad reviews. This plasma has a beautiful display. If you don't like the display of so called soap opera effect why not tune the settings to your liking? Star Trek in HD looks crystal clear, is that what you people mean by soap opera effect? lol. And everyone I've asked has never heard about plasma tv's buzzing? Weird. It took me one night to get used to the 3D glasses. Your eyes and brain have to do a bit more to take in what you are viewing. The focal point always stays clear. Other pics in the foreground and background might be blurry because of this. What I'm saying is if a car speeds past the foreground you're supposed to see a blurred image. When a car speeds past you in real life and your view is fixed you don't see a crystal image, there is a natural blur effect. Just don't think the display is bad because something that was not the focal point was blurred a bit. I have to point that out because some people are complaining, but they just don't get it. Also, definetly use your plasma for a few days for it to settle in because I noticed more artifacts the first day than a few days later.Anyways, 3D! The best effects of 3D I have seen so far is def the 3d-bluray, monsters vs aliens. I actually gave a lil flinch at the begining of the movie when the guy is playing with a paddle ball, nice! Haven't popped in Cloudy with a Chance yet. The best PS3 3D download of the 4, IMO is Motorstorm. There are smoke particle effects that are really good and that shows the brilliance of the display itself. But 3D really adds nuances that multiply the immersive effects throughout the entire game. Your car and the other AI cars kicking out mud towards the screen as you mash the gas pedal, hitting a ramp and flying toward the transition on the other side of a mountain, and driving through the over-grown brush that happens to be on the dirt path, etc. I can't wait for some full 3D games to come out because these demos must've been made with minimum detail. MLB The Show is just a great game, but I know it could have been a hell of a lot better with max 3D tuning. 3D is most prominent during the pitching/batting sequence. The batter in the box pops, and def the HUD. Stardust HD had very little 3D effect I felt. WipEout HD is a full3D game but I never liked WipEout. But from the demo of it I downloaded, it seems the craft pops from the picture the most. Haven't seen any burn in (Image Retention), after playing.2D to 3D upconversion added a little depth to the view. I had a good time playing Skate3 on it. But let me say I haven't updated my firmware yet. I actually thought 2D to 3D upconvert worked better with standard channels versus HD channels. And I think Sony did a better job with 2d upconvert to 3D because I demoed a Bravia in a Sony Style store. You can't expect too much from this feature with either brand anyway. It adds some depth from the foreground to the background, like the people on the far side of the pitch (field) at the World Cup seemed more distant than in non 3D. The glasses are comfy it really just adds a tint when they are activated. I think 3D shades would be more appropriate.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Exceptional HDTV, the 3D is just a nice bonus", "Author": "D. Workman \"David H. Workman\"", "ReviewID": "RKUZQ87ONW51D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been very impressed with the Samsung TV's for a number of years - they have very impressive image quality, holding fine detail down into the black areas of the picture. I bought this model to replace a 42\" Samsung \"HD Ready\" 1080i unit, which was only about 5 years old (and still has a very good image quality - but I wanted to upgrade to 1080P).  After a bit of research and many comparisons, I came to the conclusion that (a)Plasma is still better than LED and (b)Samsung still has the best overall picture quality.I was ready to purchase the lower end model - the PN50C550 - which really has all the features I need and is quite a bit less expensive, but I was able to get a bundled deal on the PN50C7000 along with a Samsung 3D Blu-Ray player and FOUR of the 3D glasses for a good price at Best Buy (most of the other packages I had seen only came with two sets of glasses, and were still more expensive!).  It will be a while till there is a decent selection of 3D movies, but it's a \"nice to have\" feature in the meantime.Overall I am exceedingly happy with my purchase, with a few caveats:- Upgrade the firmware immediately. The newer firmware version fixes quite a few problems, specifically with correctly setting the color space and resolution when playing a standard def DVD from a Blu-Ray player (and it also improves the 3D performance, minimizing the \"ghosting\" that many people have complained about)- The sound quality from the internal speakers is poor. I think it's the best they could do with a TV that is this thin, so the designers were constrained by the physical dimensions which prohibit proper speakers.  Get yourself an external amplifier and some decent speakers (I recommend the Denon AVR591 and the Definitive Audio ProCinema-600 speakers)- There is no S-Video input (another reason to get an external amplifier - just make sure you get one that has analog in and upsamples to 1080P HDMI out)You can't go wrong with the Samsung PNxxC7000 series (at whatever size you desire) - and if you want to save some money and don't need the 3D, the PNxxC550 series will probably suit your needs just fine.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "AMAZING TV , TIPS TO MAKE IT BETTER. !!", "Author": "J.

H.", "ReviewID": "R29MW1OXWNR6QF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I was a skeptic of 3D going into this TV purchase. In my opinion, 3D seems to be a bit of a fad, but with the price of the package I bought from Amazon ($1,499.99 for the PN50C7000, the Shrek 3D starter kit and the Samsung 3D capable C5900 Blu-ray player), the fact that it was 3D did not really figure into this purchase. In my eyes, it was a bonus since I essentially got the 3D hardware/glasses/movies for free). I did a ton of research and read many reviews from experts and users from places like CNET, Consumer Reports, Avsforum and Amazon. The fact is, most outlets rate this TV as one of the top 3-5 TVs on the market for 2D performance, so if you are skeptical of 3D, it doesn't really matter. If you like it, great, if not, you still have one of the best TVs on the market (and a 3D capable Blu-ray player) for a great price. Hopefully, this reviews can help someone that is on the fence about buying this TV.2D PerformanceStunning, the picture is simply stunning. The picture (colors, blacks, depth) is unbelievable. My wife, who is by no means videophile was taken aback the first time we watched TV. Our old HDTV was a 42\" Hitachi 1080i set that had a very respectable picture, but this TV blows it away. It is amazing how improved the picture is over the 4.5 year old Hitachi. The detail is amazing. HD Sports, HD movies and regular HD programming look great on this TV. I don't watch SD programming, so I can't speak to its SD picture. Fast motion in sports looks much, much better on this TV than my old one. Of course, that can also depend on the source material. Blu-rays in 1080p look nothing short of spectacular. Iron Man 2 and Get Him to the Greek looked amazing on Blu-ray and I think the animated movies I have watched (How to Train Your Dragon, Toy Story 3, Up, etc.) looked even better.3D Performance (with 3D content)In the first two weeks, we have watched: \"Shrek 3D\" (the first of three movies that shipped in the starter kit - the 4th Shrek was a voucher/online redemption, the website said it would be here in 8-10 weeks); and \"A Christmas Carol\". Shrek 3D was obviously not filmed in 3D, but the conversion is pretty decent. The best 3D parts are objects in the background/foreground or when there are crowds of characters. It really shows off the depth/capability of the 3D. That said, I would not rate the 3D performance at 5 stars. I would say it is solid, maybe 3.5 stars, but again, with the price of this TV, 3D was an afterthought for me. If a person is looking to buy a new TV and their biggest concern is 3D, my advice would be to wait a few years because I think either the fad will die out or the technology will be improved. Remember, the sets made this year are really the first attempt of bringing 3D to consumers.2D to 3D conversionThis feature is okay. In my opinion, it just adds depth some of the content on the screen. I watched some football, some hockey and a few movies (I have Verizon Fios with the Motorola DCT6412 HD set top box). Sports added some depth and made the graphics pop a bit, but I would rather watch a crystal clear picture than put on glasses and watch a converted 2D picture.SoundI use my receiver/5.1 set up for sound, so I will not review the sound.Rumored/Stated DrawbacksBurn-inBurn in does exist with this set. However, for me, the scrolling feature eliminated the problem. \"A Christmas Carol\" had a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, so there were \"black bars\" on the top and bottom of the screen. I could see \"burn in\" after the movie. So, before I went to bed, I set the sleep timer for an hour and turned on the \"Scrolling\" feature in the \"Screen Burn Protection\" menu. I have also seen the Nick HD symbol and the Red Zone symbols after approximately one hour of viewing, but again, the Scrolling feature knocked it out with no problems. Burn-in is a legitimate concern, but it can be eliminated if you take care of the TV. Burn-in was really the only drawback to buying a plasma, but for me, it was outweighed by the better off angle viewing, better picture quality and better 3D performance (according to multiple CNET reviews). Plus, I knew if burn-in could be eliminated with the scrolling feature (which it can), that I would take the time to make sure it is.Motion Judder IssueSamsung released a firmware update that I applied using a USB drive the third night I owned the TV. I do not see any \"Soap Opera Effect\".BuzzingThe \"buzzing\" is greatly exaggerated in my opinion, especially for anyone that currently owns a plasma TV. My Hitachi had a very low buzz. When you stood right next to it with very little or no sound, you could hear it. I am happy to report that this TV is exactly the same for me. The only time I noticed the \"buzz\" was when I was applying the update via USB, standing right next to the TV with no sound.Actual DrawbacksI am kind of knit-picking with this one, but the remote does not have a button devoted to changing the picture settings. In other words, I can't hit a button on the remote to change it from Standard to Movie to Dynamic, etc. You either have to bring up the main menu or hit the \"Tools\" button, then scroll down to change it.Related Products3D starter kit with Shrek moviesThe glasses are okay, they look incredibly dorky, but should really only be used in the dark anyway. The ones in this kit seem a bit fragile, so I am extremely careful when handling them. Once in a while we get a quick white flash or the screen goes from bright to dark very quickly. I think it happened to me twice during \"A Christmas Carol\". I assume it is some sort of sync issue with the glasses/TV. We have only watched the first Shrek in 3D, which was pretty good considering it was not originally made in 3D.Samsung 3D capable Blu-ray C5900The player has a digital optical output, but no digital coaxial output. For this reason, I use my Sony BDP-S570 Blu-ray player instead of the C5900 in the bundle I bought because my receiver only has one digital optical input (which is hooked up to Fios). Whether that is a limitation of the Samsung Blu-ray player or my receiver is subjective, I guess, but it might be important to some people.OverallI love this TV, especially for the price I paid. As I said, I got the TV, the 3D Blu-ray player and the 3D kit for $1,500. It was a unbelievable deal. The only other one I considered was the Panasonic Viera TC-P50VT25 (or 20). I am sure that is an amazing TV too (my father has a two year old 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma that is great), but at the time of purchase, neither of those TVs was available for under $2,000 and that was without the 3D Blu-ray player or the 3D kit, so it was no contest. In short, the deal I got was too good to pass up and I am glad I made the purchase.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV", "Author": "C.

I was very skeptical about getting a plasma due to all the myths and negative stories i heard about plasmas. I feared image burn in, buzzing tvs etc. but I couldn't help but notice when I googled \"best tvs of 2010\" plasmas were always on top of the most reliable web sites as the best tvs, even better than the much hyped LEDS. I bought this tv with the plan of returning it within the same day. All my doubts went out the window within the first minute. This tv is amazing, puts my old lcd to shame. Its way beyond what I expected. The picture is nothing short of amazing. It looks as though the actors are in your room performing for you, ive never seen anything like it and im an electronic junkie. The T.V. achieves depth without 3d. Its an amazing technology. The downside so far is that the tv is so vivid that you can really see the cg in movies. For example, i though avatar was amazing at making the cg look so real, on this tv Avatar looks like toy story. To fix this you have to take away colors and brightness to make the tv actually look worst in order to make it look better. Never thought i would want to downgrade settings due to the tv looking too real. The 3d is 3d..its kind of a gimmick but it works great. The main thing about the tv is the display itself. Gorgeous video. Goes way beyond my expectations, internet videos do not do it justice.As far as burn in and buzzing goes, there is no buzz what so ever, this was my major fear for buying a plasma, but no buzz at all. The tv has a buzz sound if you put your ear to it, but its the same sound as all TVs . As far as burn in goes, I've seen the faint image of my ps3 time and date show after keeping my menu screen on for an hour (testing the TV limits). The screen wipe feature cleared it up in a matter of seconds. I'm breaking in the TV now by playing a dvd with repeating colors for 100 hours.The only drawback and reason why I can't give this tv 5 stars is because the Sound is pretty bad when turned up. At regular volume, its good, just like any other tv, but turn it up and the speakers sound as if they are broke. Sound gets scratchy and distorted.The internet aspect of the tv so far seems overrated. I was very excited for new tvs with apps and now that i have apps on my tv..its like meh. If you have netflix on ps3, xbox, wii or another device, chances are your going to stick with your systems when watching it because the tvs netflix app is decent but not nearly as good as the others. Youtube is clear and automatically in hd but again..it sounds cool to have but its just...youtube. And its like youtubeXL, its more like a cellphone or ps3 youtube. Its all faster on your cpu and laptop so there really is no point to these apps. If you dont have a cpu or a laptop you may love it. I was so excited for the internet features at first but now I feel like its cool to have but I'll stick with my cpu and cell phone.Bottom line is the tv exceeds my expectations 10 fold. Changed my view of plasmas and it has a jaw dropping picture. I dont think any tv on the market can give you more bang for your buck. Im very curious how much better other tvs can possibly look. This tv already boggles my mind. Cnet.com says the two top tvs above this are samsung C8000 and the number 1 tv is the Panasonic tc-pvt20. Im sure the C8000 is possibly slightly better than the C7000 and the Panasonic is Just barely better than that, settling on a $1000 less tv with slightly less performance makes the C7000 the best tv of 2010 IMO.

The picture is absolutely amazing, both with BluRay and also HD TV stations. The picture is extremely clear and adds depth to the picture. Once you put the glasses on it adds a fun 3d experience. Although currently there are limited 3d movies titles available. I believe a lot more will be released later in 2011. Also be aware that the glasses are currently $150 each!We got a great deal. Along with the TV we received a free 3d BluRay player and Shrek starter kit (x2 glasses and Shrek 1, 2, 3 and 4).Be aware that this 50\" is plasma, whereas the other sizes are LCD. Plasma actually offers a slightly better picture quality to LCD with deeper blacks; but it is not good for video games. You could experience the image being burnt in with excessive playing. If you want to play video games on this TV, I would recommend one of the other sizes which is LCD.As with most TV's the speakers on the TV are not up to par. I would recommend that you add some kind of sound system. I went with a Pioneer 920 receiver, with BIC America DV62si speakers with a BIC America center speaker and F12 subwoofer. All can be had on Amazon for about $700 with free shipping. The sound is amazing and matches the picture.

There was this blur around any moving object on the screen that bled into the background.  This was very distracting.  I played with the settings until I was sick of it and fine tuned it with the help of some websites, but it never got any better.

There were some ghosting around some images, especially when the 3D effect was trying to come too far out at you. The 2D to 3D conversion was really bad, so don't purchase this TV just for that.

Upgraded from an old 37 inch LCD that I bought back in 2004 (can you say early adopter?). Needless to say this is a whole new experience.PICTURE:The first warning I must give anyone is once you have everything set up, INTALL THE FIRMWARE UPDATE. Sorry to \"yell\" but this is really important. At first, I was a little worried. All my HD channels looked like bad soap operas. But I just connected my TV to the internet and did the software update. Immediate fix. Now, the picture is really top notch. With just a few tweaks I was able to get everything optimized for my moderately lit room. I am experiencing a little ghosting but from what I have read this is typical in new Plasma TVs and should go away after the 100 hour mark. The ghost images go away pretty quickly after watching a full screen HD channel for a few minutes.SOUND:Like most people have said, the internal speaker is so-so ... but if you are considering a 50 inch plasma and have no home theater system you might want to hold off until you can invest in both.INTERNET APPS:The Samsung Apps are kind of cool. I've only played with a few of them, but so far the Netflix and Ted Talks apps are the ones I see myself using the most. Netflix operates very similarly to how the the XBOX 360 app works. It's nice to not have to fire up the XBOX every time I want to watch Netflix. With this new TV you can just launch it with the click of a button. (Once again, make sure you have the latest app version. The Neflix app that came pre-installed was woefully outdated.) Hopefully they will continue to add popular services to this menu.3D:Well what can I say... it works, but it's not something I see myself using alot. I got the glasses as part of a bundle deal that Amazon was running. It's a nice to have but so far seems more like a novelty, not a necessity. Can put a real strain on your eyes after an hour or so.FINAL THOUGHTS:In the end, very happy with the purchase. Great TV for a good price. Free scheduled delivery with Amazon Prime a huge plus.

When I am watching TV I typically have the laptop open and I'm up and around the house. To sit and actually watch an entire movie etc in 3D.....not happeing.That being said there was an excellent deal on this TV at a Big Box retailer that made me check it out.So far it is simply excellent. I bought an open box and together with the TV,extended warranty, professional calibration and a slimline type wall mount I was out the door for less than $1600 tax ,tags everything.I loaded it, no box, in the back of the Saturn Vue and took it home being careful to keep it upright as they say you should with plasmas.I set up the mount and hung it up on the wall and with much anticipation flicked the button on the expensive looking remote.The picture is simply jaw dropping. I had a 42 in LG Scarlet TV before and have since moved it the the bedroom. The LG has a great HD picture but this new Samsung plasma is something else.  I shopped for a new larger TV for some time and spent quite a while looking at TV after TV  andto try and gauge just which had the best bang for the buck. The balck levels on this TV are superb amoung the best I have seen. The clarity rivals that of the best LCD LED models that I have looked at. The picture is just simply richer and has more depth with the better plasmas. The model that I have was also was set up with the store demo. When this is on, it will revert the picture back to the \"dynamic\" setting every half hour or so unless reset. To do this you need to have the source on the TV set to \"TV\". Next you go into the plug and play menu and scroll through and select the home mode instead of store mode. Presto, no more eye searing colors on the TV screen.The rest of the menu setup is very intuitive. Even though mine did not come with a manual ,that information is readily available online.Bluray DVDs look extremely clear and motion blur is a thing of the past. The LG I have does an ok job with motion blur but this Samsung all but eliminates it. Sports on the Samsung are awesome to look at and the field on football games now looks much more realistic.I have it hooked up to a Harmon Kardon AV reciever, Sony blueray and the no longer available AR speakers. Its a good  combination. To get much better you would have to spend a lot more money I think.The TV also looks great on the wall with the Sanus mount. Its looks just like a framed painting. I hide the wires behind the wall for a seamless look.I have not yet tried the 3D capabilities. As I mention before I don't think that's something I'm interested in. I may be wrong but I think 3D will go the way of quadrophonic sound soon enough as long as you have to wear the expensive glasses. Like I say, I may be wrong but, I don' think so.Otherwise the wireless connectivity is decent. The sales guy told me that the TV's typically don't have as much ram as the wireless DVD's so they can't stream movies as well. Don't know, seems ok to me with  Netflix.You may walk right past these TV's if you are looking for Plasma as they are shockingly thin for a Plasma. I even saw the open box price on mine and thought it was a mistake because this TV was obviously one of those new fangled LED things. Nope, its a Plasma with Plasma picture and deep blacks and no motion blur etc. I have not heard any buzzing from mine at all.

It has an excellent picture and pretty good sound for a flat panel.  I'd rate the picture at 5 stars and the sound at 4.  However this tv struggles in other areas.  The reason I returned mine was because of a horrible image retention (screen burn) issue.  Now I'm well aware that plasma tv's are going to suffer from minor image retention but it was over the top on this tv.  I noticed images being burt in from day one.  A week to the day after I purchased it was when it went over the top.  I had it on NFL network for about 15 minutes and then turned on my Xbox 360 and for the rest of the night I could see the NFL symbol in the bottom right corner.  The words \"week 10\" were also burnt into the left corner.  After reading up on image retention I learned that it usually clears up in a matter of minutes but not with this tv.  Four hours later it was still there when I went to bed.  The next day it was gone but it only took a few minutes for new images to burn in.  The guy at Sears told me that I would have to deal with it with that tv so I took it back.  I'm now getting ready to purchase a Panasonic 3d.As far as the 3d on this tv....not impressive.  After only a few minutes my eyes felt tired and I really just wanted to switch back to 2d.  The 2d to 3d convert was nothing special either.  I went to Best Buy to check out the Panasonic because of the good reviews I had read and WOW....it completely blows Samsung's 3d out of the water.  It's so much more clear and smooth.  It doesn't strain your eyes either.  It actually feels like 3d in a movie theater instead of a cheap 3d like with Samsung.So all in all this tv has a good 2d picture with unimpressive 3d.

Very Good Picture and black levels, though a 3 year old Pioneer Elite 50 inch 720P still beats it from 12 to 15 ft away. Need to adjust the picture some, to get the best out of it. The BD player does an excellent job of upconverting the less than 1080p inputs.2. The wall mounting and thinness, plus appearance really is first class. The inputs are beautifully arranged. The appearance on the wall with hidden cables makes me smile everytime.3. The Samsung apps, PC share work well, however a Samsung Blue ray player BD6900 realy helps, some features are only available when the BD player is hooked up.4. The remotes between the TV and BD player are as well integrated as can be expected, give Samsung full marks for this one.I am afraid to think (or find out) if this all would not be the same with a BD6800 or lower/older model, did not want to find out so sprung the extra for the BD6900. The BD player is also really fast loading up, a big plus. Use a High speed ethernet HDMI cable and hooked up through ethernet, more on that later.5. Works well with the Sanus 1100 thin wall mount (under $100), can tilt up the TV and access the rear very easily. Wasn't about to spring for the super expensive Samsung wall mount rip-off, its just a glorified picture hanger for $250 !!Cons:1. The dedicated wireless had trouble hooking up, and I hear that streaming video on wireless is still not ready for prime time. I luckily had ethernet access which I utilized and it was the best thing I did. Still have not tried out streaming video, but Youtube with its low bandwidth works fine (though the picture is like a VHS tape quality)2. TV runs hot, hotter than some other plasmas. I guess I won't be cold this winter since it is in the bedroom. I hear all plasmas run hot, and that this is nothing to worry about when it comes to longetivity of the display or anything.3. Sound quality is OK, about 1/2 of what a stereo/amp dedicated speakers would produce.Note:I used a line conditioner (Belkin, under $100) that also protects against Voltage spikes and such, plus the ferrite magnet at one end of the power cable. Guess what, NO buzz at all, and the picture is crisp with deep colors and blacks.I am also afraid to run it with older Amps and Stereos, even with HDMI for compatibility issues, sound and picture quality degradation. Luckily, in the Bedroom, I don't need to and the wife prefers the cleaner look without speaker cables and stereo lights at night.I am surprised at all the issues with incompatibility that I read about with proprietary BS that is getting into these 3D TV's and BD players. Why can't they make good stereo boxes with all their electronic trickery instead and make plain TV monitors and BD players at half the cost. That way, compatibility will not be an issue. I guess its a marketing decision again!So far, I took the path of least resistance and kept it simple.

Except that over time the problem got worse, and the old trick of turning the TV off stopped working.At this point I contacted tech support to complain about the issue, and they directed me to a an authorized repair shop. I called them, and they wanted to charge me $250 just for the visit, and fixing the issue would cost anywhere between $500 and $1,200. In other words, it could cost me almost as much as a new TV. I contacted Samsung again to see if they would be willing to cover at least the cost of the visit, but no luck.After some Google research, I tinkered with the image settings, and this helped reduce the problem. Unfortunately it was just a matter of time before the problem started to happen again, getting worse over time. I contacted Samsung through their Facebook support page, they emailed me a few questions, and then told me the same story: out of warranty, contact an authorized repair shop. I told them about my past experience, and tried to reason with them to arrive to some reasonable compromise, but after numerous email exchanges I asked to be directed to the person's supervisor. The reply I got back was that she was the supervisor, so at this point, I'm completely out of luck.There are basically two things I can do at this point: 1) Never buy Samsung again; and 2) Write this review, so other people have fair warning.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Broken circuit board", "Author": "W.

Not an issue for me because i hooked up my soround sound anyways. It also has some I.R. but it is temporary and never affects the viewing experience. In my opinion this tv blows away the more expensive new lcd tvs(including led backlit). Plasma is the way to go if you are looking for the most life-like picture possible.

I also have a SONY S570 Upconverting 3d blu-ray player, and I tried it out with this TV while waiting for the out-of-stock Samsung player.First, watching the 3d movies I have was amazing, and others have commented on that aspect of this set, so I won't be redundant.However, what blew me and my friends out of the water was the conversion of 2d blu rays to 3d.  Although not as good as watching blu ray 3d discs, for those movies not in 3d yet, it was stunning.  We watched sections from Avatar, The 300, Phantom of the Opera, the Fifth Element, Blade Runner--all 2d blu rays--and there were so many \"wows\" and \"awesomes\" from us all, you would have thought the movies were actual 3d blu rays!  Next we popped in Lord of the Rings (DVD), and with the upconversion of the SONY and the 2d-3d conversion of the SAMSUNG, once again we were all amazed at the 3d.  A couple of funny \"glitches\" did occur -- for example, when Bilbo is looking at the map of middle earth, the mountains drawn on the map (which are of course supposed to stay in 2d) popped out, as if the map were a relief map!  Other than that, the movie was crystal clear, nobody noticed any ghosting, and the 3d was VERY impressive.  I can't wait to try the 2d-3d on live TV!So, if you're looking for a GREAT 3d set that also does a FANTASTIC job converting your 2d movies to 3d, I can't imagine there being anything else out there that is better than the SAMSUNG.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Picture both in 2d and in 3d", "Author": "Keith Kekic \"Keith Kekic author of Nightwalkers\"", "ReviewID": "R1AFVU9O8K3Z17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this with the free glasses and blu ray for 1539.

Later I even read in  the manual that it only passes 2 channels out the optical out put. Boo.Next Issue, I love the pip function of the tv. What Stinks is that you have to navigate halfway downt the settings menu to the general settings and then navigate all the way to the bottom of the PIP settings menu then turn it on or off. and you have to do the same thing to get out of the PIP. The PIP has some cool other functions I have not seen before but its a pain to get there. Guess I will just have to get good at it.Great TV.

Going into the holidays, this is not what I wanted to hear. We are waiting for a call next week to hopefully schedule the repair. Customer service was very friendly, but repair will be TOO SLOW! Especially considering we should not be repairing this set for at least another 3 - 5 years.The next issue is the image retention. MUCH worse than I ever experienced with my other two plasma sets which were both Panasonic. NOW I know what people are talking about with image retention under normal viewing conditions on certain plasma TVs. I never experienced it on either of my Panasonic plasmas, so I just assumed people were being overly picky. This TV retains almost any static image left on the screen longer than a few seconds. Again, pretty unacceptable.I am not all that impressed with the 3D viewing either. At least the Samsung implementation seems to flicker a lot as you are watching movies. This becomes more evident with brighter scenes.Lastly, I am not crazy about the Aspect controls.

There appears to be an overheating Logic Board in this model, and the board itself is on back order with Samsung, suggesting the problem is at least fairly widespread. This means you may have to wait indefinitely for a replacement part, despite the product being under warranty. The issue (all deep blacks turn red) doesn't manifest itself until the television has been on long enough to heat up (10 minutes or so), so it's likely the delivery man will be long gone when you discover the problem. You'll be forced to deal with Samsung's customer service department, who will do silly things like assigning you a local service repair center that's two hours away and designating your case a \"drop off\" instead of \"in home\" repair (before you talk sense into them).A caveat: the television, when running properly, is beautiful, absolutely stunning. Textures and lighting in video games will be noticeably superior to your old 720/1080i CRTs. Blu-ray movies, even ones with original prints in the 70s, will impress your family. If the television works as it should, it is well worth the price. Early adoption has some drawbacks, and receiving a defective device is one potential danger. If you don't need a new television immediately (as I did), it's often wise to wait a few months before picking up a 2010 model.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "3D FUNCTION DID NOT WORK", "Author": "Juan M.

I returned the starter kit, thinking it may have been the disc itself. When the new disk came it still had the same problem, so i went to think it was the bluray player, but i tried 3D programming from my cable provider (time warner cable), and it still had the same problem with the vertical lines when i went to 3d mode. I tried all 3 different 3D modes that the TV had, and in the first one it showed a very blurry image (not the typical blurry you get from 3D), and 3D never really worked. I had the most expensive advanced HDMI cable, and i went through troubleshooting over the phone with samsung customer service and i was unable to resolve the issue. Finally i decided to return the item, and i am awaiting my refund from amazon so i can buy a new TV. I will try panasonic this time, and hopefully it works better.

I even chatted with tech support and they confirmed that it was indeed skype capable.  Turns out, it is only the LED tvs that are.  Now I'm stuck with a useless $150 camera.  Also, I have founfd that the codecs that are supposedly supported in the Media Play feature do not work properly.  If you just want a TV, this is a good option, but please be very careful if you are buying it for features.  I've found Samsung is very deceptive about the feature set.The decision not to include Skype seems purely for the purpose of milking customers into buying a more expensive TV.
