I was set to buy a Vizio 240hz TV blah, blah, blah, then I actually looked at this one and it was just better. Better or more realistic picture and a better price. I was all hung up on contrast ratio, Hz, etc and what I remembered when I watched was this TV just has a great picture. I have since learned that most top makers are no longer going to talk contrast etc. because it can be misleading.

When I walked in I was all set to purchase a 42\" LG, but after seeing all of the sets side by side, the Hitachi L42S503 really stood out. I realize that they are not all calibrated correctly at the store, but this set did not disappoint when I got it home. After some minor color calibration tweaks the image as outstanding. I highly recommend this TV for anyone looking for a great value without compromising on quality.", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Hitachi L42S503 a winner!", "Author": "Steven M. Angelini \"Steve\"", "ReviewID": "R2VOMNJJ01ZJ5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this 42\" LCD about a month or so ago after a lot of research and shopping around. I did all of my due diligence with regard to seeing all comparable sets in person to get up close and personal with the options. etc. Hitachi makes a top notch product and does have great customer service as well. In fact, I have only called them once since installing the TV and it wasn't even a question with regard to the LCD but moreso about an issue that turned out to be the interaction with my Blu-ray player and they took the time to troubleshoot the issue with success. Not to mention it was a painless wait to get to a support specialist and it wasn't outsourced but rather based in California.This TV has a very sharp picture with true vibrant color that is spot on. I barely changed any of the factory settings with regard to the picture. The sound is decent but took some fiddling with the setups. I typically always watch this TV through the surround sound system plus I'm no audiophile so it's fine for me when running through the unit speakers. The backlight can be a little bright in the corners from time to time but it is ONLY visible when the screen is completely black. You can eliminate this if you chose to do so by setting it to a lower level. I love the picture as is and have opted to leave it be. The trade off is the best picture I feel the TV has to offer...no biggie.I shopped around for a while to get the best deal and ended up purchasing this at Sam's Club for $747 in early December 09'. Absolutely worth the price and in my opinion it is a superior unit over comparable Vizeo's, Samsungs, etc...", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good price. Solid Mid level tv.", "Author": "Boweavel", "ReviewID": "RRVJY6H046IWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 42 inch Hitachi television is a great buy I look for a long time for a television for blu ray movies ps3 and Xbox 360 gaming. This tv impresses with great crisp contrast even though i couldn't find a contrast ratio for the tv before I bought it. Side by side this tv stands up well with Sony Vizio and Samsung. although like the one review said the back lighting is a little stronger in the corners but this is a unnoticeable problem except when a complete black screen is up. Oddly enough i don't see this issue in dark rooms in movies or games. Also a small gripe when switching HDMI channels it takes a second or two to load my old tv was much quicker at this. Nonetheless this tv is a bargain for the price and stacks up favorably to the large brands.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great 42\" LCD HDTV", "Author": "C.

I purchased this set based off of the Conssumer Rreports ratings, 72 out of the highest rated 75. Other sets in its scoring range were between 1,000-1,400. This hitachi has excellent high definition picture quality, and I have watched the nfl championship games, and several basketball games, and noticed no problems whatsoever with the 120hz processor.This is the best priced tv for a 42\" 120hz 1080p lcd.

I think the picture on this is better than the Sony and Toshiba I have owned.  Its 1080p, 120Hz, 4ms response time, and it has 4hdmi's, 7hd inputs all together and I got it for $599 shipped.  The backlighting is a little strong but you can adjust it to your liking, there is plenty of setting options.  The only thing I didn't like was they listed the dynamic contrast ratio as being high, they wouldn't give an exact number even if you checked the Hitachi website, but don't let that stop you from buying this TV, you won't be dissapointed.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "S.

I play a lot of Xbox 360 and PS3 games on it and it's great for that too.

I can turn the backlight down and it helps but then the overall picture is too dark.Too bad because this TV has the best picture I ever saw for an LCD except for the backlight bleeding into the toptwo corners.

Out of the box, I kept getting statical noise that would occur randomly and sporadically, never able to quite predict when it would happen. Sometimes we thought the noise was so bad that the TV would explode!Anyways, after patiently waiting almost a year, to see if it would go away, and maybe out of laziness, I finally called Hitachi customer service to get this fixed under the 1 year warranty. They tried replacing the board inside at first. To even get to that point took 1-2 months. It didn't work, and trying to work with them and the electronics company that fixes TV's, they took weeks to get back to me, even though I kept telling them the issues and that talking to the electronics company would probably not help since they didn't even know the solution.After a month or two of many phone calls and waiting, I had to go on vacation, so when I got back, they replaced the power source, which didn't fix it either. Again, I had to go through weeks of phone calls where they kept trying to contact that electronics company to find out what can be done, when again, they just didn't seem to know! Then the agent got sick, this and that (she was really nice, however), and a month or two passed again. When they finally got back to me, I had to go again overseas for an internship, so the agent told me to call them when I get back so correct parts could be ordered (she didn't seem to know what parts, however). She told me since the issue is the same issue and since it wasn't fixed, this would still be covered by the manufacturer's warranty.So I come back, call, and the original Hitachi agent is no longer with the company, and now they say I need to use my extended warranty (thank goodness I bought one). After doing all the tests they wanted me to do, sending in the sales receipt, calling many times to get through to them and talk to agents that knew about warranty, they simply decided that they won't fix this. Now I have to start all over again. I think I might just end up living with the statical noise and let people know of the horrible experience I had with Hitachi's seemingly incompetent technical staff. The customer service agents were very nice, I'll give them credit, but boy do they NOT know how to fix issues AND the upper management certainly likes to pass the buck onto others.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I LOVE AND HATE THIS TV", "Author": "Adrian B.

We debated between a couple of brands, but decided to give this Hitachi a try.  We were very disappointed to find the screen uniformity to be very uneven, with lighter areas along the edges and darker areas in the center.  We also found that the blacks were not as deep as some of the other brands.  The colors seemed fairly accurate, but the clarity was not as crisp and clear as either the Sony or the Samsung models we currently own.  To sum up, we were disappointed with this model and returned the set.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Ultimate high definition HDTV.\nFull HD 1080p 120Hz picture quality\n7 High definition inputs", "Name": "Hitachi 42S503 42 inch UltraVision 1080P 120Hz LCD Flat Panel HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NVFpVRn6L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002KLLG2I"}}
