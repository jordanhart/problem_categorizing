{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Vizio rocks!  Best bang for the buck deal! Amazing 65\" price.", "Author": "Pat", "ReviewID": "R1S3NCWQ52NNMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So our Samsung 720 61\" Rear DLP color wheel died again and it was time for a replacement. I know I can fix the samsung with a $150 part, AGAIN, but it's getting old.  I did the rounds, checked Sams, Costco, and BestBuy.  Found this model as the best bang for the buck.  I ended up getting mine from Costco for $1299 which was cheaper than Amazon's price, but now, two days later, it looks like Amazon has dropped their price with free shipping to basically match Costco's price with tax.  But still, can't beat the extra warranty and ease of replacement I get with having purchased at Costco.  I buy so much from Amazon (absolutely love prime!), but large TV's like this, I just don't see the point in going online if you are lucky and can get the same deal (even after tax) locally. I read SamsClub is going to have these for BlackFriday doorbuster price of $1000 (no raincheck), but I don't feel like waiting in line overnight only to loose out, and I needed a tv now for the family room.There is a 3D version of this TV for a few hundred more.  SamsClub had this on display.  Wow, the front of the 3D version is like a mirror.  Just standing back looking at all the TVs, the 3D version of this one was just terrible with so many reflections. I would have paid the few hundred extra for 3D, but it just didn't seem worth it to have to put up with distracting reflections for the majority of our TV viewing just for that very rare 3D movie. I do not know what they were thinking on why they made that 3d version front so reflective.  I tried some 3D tvs at BestBuy and just did not like what I saw. 2D is what most stuff is anyways, so I scratched 3D off our list.So on to this TV.Assembly -  I was amazed I was actually going to need some tools! The instructions actually call for you to place the TV FACE DOWN onto a ledge (dining room table?) so that you can attach the bottom stand mount.  No way was I going to do that.  I placed it backside on some towels and then just carefully attached the plate from the bottom.Instructions - There are basically none! Just a quick start guide.Inputs - This is one possible future downside.  Only 3 HDMI inputs.  2 on the back, 1 on the side, ALTHOUGH, at least the one on the side is still in quite a ways so I don't need to worry about the cable sticking out the side.  Still, I don't understand why they can't provide at least 4 or 5 inputs. But 3 is fortunately enough for me.Remote - In setting up the TV, the remote was quite nice.  The keyboard is really useful for typing things in now. The buttons at the top of the front though don't feel that good though.  When I press the NetFlix button, I feel a click.  But not when I press the two outside buttons.Sound - The speakers are on the backside.  But since I send all our sound through a Yamaha receiver, I didn't care what the TV sounded like so I can't offer any opinion on that.TV Stand - I can see how some might consider it a \"little\" flimsy.  I'm not worried at all though.  If I grab the side for example to feel/push some of the buttons, it does move a little, but I don't think this is a big deal.So I finally turned it on. It takes about 30 seconds till the image is up. Right away the TV goes into setup mode. It was very easy to follow the instructions.  I quickly got the wifi connected. I dont' broadcoast our SSID and I use WPA2 but it was still very easy to type everything in.  It quickly connected.  I was able to easily rename the HDMI1 input to DirecTv, the remote's keyboard really helps. Finally, some TV! I open the DirecTv guide and it is so clear. Everything just pops.  Wow, what a picture. It's just so clear and sharp.  And the blacks are amazing.  I had some SciFi shows recorded on the DVR and fired up some black dark scenes and it was just amazing. I could not believe some of the details I was able to now see. Absolutely blows away our old 720p DLP.  I'm not a picky person but for the first time ever, my wife actually made some comments about the color though.  She \"thought\" the color was a bit dulled. I thought it was fine.  I played around with some picture settings.  She really liked \"Vivid\", it was fine for me too, maybe a little on the aggressive color side.  In the end, we just went with \"Custom\" and turned down the brightness a little. Even though this is an EdgeLit LED, I was not able to see any uneven lighting, everything seemed uniform to me.Watching some HD network shows that evening, I will say, the TV is so sharp and clear, that it's just such a new experience. Like the shows were shot with some new type of camera!Later that night, it was time to reprogram our logitech remote. Connected the logitech remote to my PC, and logitech found the model number for this tv.  Great!  In no time, I had the TV turning on/off and switching inputs.Finally, I decided to play around with the apps.  This is where things got a little frustrating.  I pressed the amazon button at the top of the remote since we have prime.  I'm pretty certain that remote button clicked the first time, but it doesn't anymore.  The TV popped something up, but that went away, and now, pressing that button again, nothing would happen. So I pressed the big middle button on the remote and I see the apps popup at the bottom.  I scrolled through them but didn't see amazon anywhere. So I checked the \"quick start\" guide again and there are two pages that did help a little.  Followed some instructions, opened the app store, tv downloaded some kind of update, eventually I was back in the app store.  I was able to remove alot of apps that I know I wouldn't use like NetFlix, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  I did add Amazon and AccuWeather.  For amazon, it gives you a code that you then need to enter from your computer to activate that device.  Eventually I was watching a prime movie. Nice!  The apps are a bit slow though. Quite a few times it would show a \"working\" like cursor and you just were stuck and had to be patient.  I also really dislike icon only based apps (especially when the icons are so small) and wonder what exactly those icons mean at the bottom of the left bar.  I was able to click on them.  One of them closes the bar, the other did something, but don't rememeber.  The apps do require a bit of excessive up/down/left/right/ok/back type navigation.  I didn't buy the TV for the apps though, but it's nice they are there.In the end, this is a killer tv deal for it's size and price. Without a doubt, this is a keeper! I remember buying our first Vizio many many years ago when they first came out, and since then, all future tv purchases, after carefully shopping around, also ended up being Vizios.  The Samsung DLP was the last one. And now, that too is replaced with a Vizio.  Haven't had a single problem with any of our other Vizio's.I am extremely happy with this purchase.UPDATE: 12/3/12Edge Lit: I think I now know what some people may mean by non-uniform edge lighting, but I had to have all the lights off at night in a totally dark room and I could only notice it during the tv startup. And the uneven edge lighting is more discernible from extreme off axis viewing, again only while tv was turning on, during that 30 second delay. From straight on, it was less.  Essentially there is some more lighting that is noticeable in the corners of the tv.  Once fully on and watching TV, I just couldn't spot it.Remote: I guess I jinxed myself when I mentioned I hadn't had any problems with our prior vizio's.  My initial comment about the remote buttons that were not clicking, it seems maybe one was stuck, my amazon button, as my amazon bar started popping up for no reason. Fortunately, we use a logitech for most stuff so I put the vizio remote away. I called up Vizio support, registered my TV, explained the stuck button, and a new remote was shipped out to me.  New remote came and it works great! All the buttons, including the amazon button, have a nice click feeling to them.  Awesome support!!!The TV has an ambient light sensor.  It tries to auto adjust the brightness depending on what the light levels are in the room.  I found this option when poking around the menus. It has sensitivity settings for off, low, medium, and high.  Over the past month, on a few occasions during night tv viewing, I have noticed the tv brightness dynamically change even though the ambient light levels did not. Isn't a big deal for me, it's only done it like 2 or 3 times.  I like the feature actually, it seems to be doing it's job. At night, the image is not too bright and during the day, the image is bright and pops.UPDATE: 12/16/12While the logitech site did have this model in their database, and things worked for me initially, after I hooked up my remaining devices I ran into some issues switching inputs and found the database did not have discrete remote codes for power or input switching for this model.  Luckily I found another vizio model, E421VA, and when I reprogrammed my harmony 650 remote using this tv instead, I was able to solve my problems and now the tv correctly turns on and switches inputs when choosing different activities.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stunning Picture With Little to No Error in Perfection", "Author": "R. Calderon \"The Duck Knight Rises\"", "ReviewID": "R10RSLAX7OC9N7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, let me say I have been a loyal VIZIO customer for at least 4 years and own all VIZIO TV's. I have had only one issue with a VIZIO TV in the past and that was QA issue, there was nothing functionally wrong with it. This TV was purchased on BF from Sam's Club. With that being said..I have experienced a \"glitch\" with my TV where, the picture will go out and come back in after a couple of seconds, with the audio staying perfect intact. This occurs with any of the 3 HDMI slots, as well as the component slot, with all known working cables. VIZIO also has an issue with this TV where if you use WPA2 settings for your WIFI security, the remote becomes very unresponsive, if you don't use WPA2, it works fine. I have tested this and can say this is all true. I, however do not use the remote, and use a Universal remote, but please be aware of this if you are considering purchasing this TV and use WPA2.The picture is beautiful, when it doesn't go in and out. When playing a movie on Blu ray, the crispness and motion flaw is superior. If you are a sports fan like myself, it's very hard to comment on. Some of the channels I watch, ESPN, FSN, YES, etc. the colors vary. Some are over saturated and others aren't (ESPN). Watching the main channels (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC) all seem to be in tune with one another.The sound coming from the TV, sounds good, but I don't use them as I have a 7.1 receiver for my sound, but the built-in speakers are up to par with the big boys (Samsung, Panasonic).I do have the Disney WoW Calibration disc to calibrate the colors and settings for my TV. However, I am using the current settings below which are satisfying so far. Once I do a full calibration, I will post an edit with those settings to share. For now, use the below and you should be good to go.Backlight - 82Brightness - 49Contrast - 56Color - 70Tint - -2Sharpness - 6Horizontal Position - 32Vertical Position - 16Horizontal Size - 0Vertical Size - 0Color Temperature - CustomAll RGB Gains/Offsets - 50Smooth Motion Effect - OffNoise Reduction - LowMPEG NR - LowColor Enhancement - OffAdaptive Luma - OffFilm Mode - AutoBacklight Control - OffAmbient Light Sensor - OffI MUST reiterate, this TV does have an issue if you use WPA2 for security and does experience a glitch where the picture goes out and comes back after a couple of seconds. I did notify VIZIO of this, however, they claimed there are no known issues with this TV. I find that hard to believe. If you check AVSForum's official M650VSE thread, you will see some of these issues. I sure do not want to have to take down a 65\" TV that weighs close to 100 pounds off a wall, that is 6 feet off the ground.Until the picture issue is resolved, I am giving this a 4/5 stars. I would rate it a 3/5, but the remote feature I will not be using with the TV.Edit 12/13: I made changes last night to the TV and did not experience the \"glitch\" I previously posted. I will do some more digging this weekend and will update this review with my findings.Edit 12/15: I made the following comment on my post and am repeating it here.. It seems after I made this review, VIZIO has made a firmware update and I received it, even though after contacting their support a couple of days ago and claiming there were no known issues, I can verify I am no longer seeing the picture go out and come back in after a couple of seconds. Again I don't use VIZIO's remote, so I can't confirm anything regarding the WPA2 security use and the delay being resolved. The current firmware is that of: 3.43.847. I will be using the Disney WoW Calibration disc this weekend to update the settings above to the best of my 20/20 vision and have updated my stars on this from 4/5 to 5/5.Edit 12/16: I made revisions to the settings above the only major change I made was the tint from 0 to -2 and added the backlight that I forgot which is set at 52. Again this was used using the Disney WoW Calibration Disc.Edit 12/18: I have noticed the TV doing the same issue in my review with the picture randomly going out and coming back on. VIZIO customer support can't figure out the issue and are replacing the TV entirely. Not very happy to take down a TV that is 95lbs and is mounted 6 feet high. I am not recommending this TV until the replacement comes and I know the issue has been resolved.Edit 12/29: I talked to VIZIO again, this time someone who had some knowledge. He said to up the Backlight to around 80-85. Since doing that I have not noticed the TV going out (this has been 3-4 days now). I have since cancelled my service request. I'm rating this back to 4 stars. Since there is a 1 year warranty, I will see how things go in the weeks/months to come. If anything changes, I will update as necessary.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "65\" WIFI LED TV FOR LESS THAN $1500!?", "Author": "Michael Quinlan", "ReviewID": "R17XTHMVVN9EC3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At $1500 or less, the value of the VIZIO M650VSE blows the competition out of the water, no one else comes close to offering a 65\" LED smart tv for $1500 or less. In the current market for tvs, there's a huge price point difference between 60\" and 65\" which may change over time, but I've personally been trolling websites for months and this is the first 65\" tv with wifi capabilities below $1500. I did not hesitate to order it online when this became available. Being an LED is a huge and unexpected bonus.I've been on the VIZIO website a lot before pulling the trigger and they have two model series, model E and model M. Model E is offered in 60\" and 70\", and looks super sleek, the frame itself is super thin. For whatever reason it's not offered on 65\" otherwise I'd scoop that up. The model M is their only 65\" model and its frame is slightly chunky by comparison.I'm curious why there aren't more reviews of this product? Why is VIZO's only model in their Model M series their chunky 65\" model, while their Model E series has a thinner frame and comes in 60\" or 70\". Are they both new products? If so why make the 65\" inferior?I also went all in and bought a soundbar, the VIZIO VHT215, because I figured they would integrate, great reviews online. While the tv only has 3 HDMI inputs, you can run two additional HDMI devices through the soundbar.As an extra bonus feature the back of the remote has a keyboard, good luck finding that anywhere else.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "Former Loyal Vizio Customer", "ReviewID": "R14WTC5276NTGC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I want to preface my review by stating that I never leave product reviews and own 3 other Vizio televisions...I have owned this TV for 6 months now and it is in the process of being repaired for the second time (I think). Right out of the box, the TV did not respond to the remote. I had to connect my computer's keyboard to the side in order to bypass the setup process. Even still, I was unable to use the internet apps. More of an annoyance than anything. I called Vizio's customer support and they sent me out a new remote. Upon receiving the second remote, I had the same issue. When I called customer support the second time, the rep was very friendly and walked me through a couple troubleshooting steps. She asked me if I would like to have the TV repaired or replaced. Since it had already been a few weeks and I didn't want to wait another 2-3 weeks for a replacement, I decided to have it repaired.The technician came to my house and ended up replacing the motherboard. I thought all was well until one night (3 months later) the TV flashed red, then shut itself off. The next morning, it turned itself off 2 more times. I started hearing a high pitched frequency sound coming from the TV so I unplugged it. The noise stopped. Tried plugging it back in and the noise started again.  Third call to customer service...Again, the rep walked me through various troubleshooting steps. Push the side buttons, unplug, try a new outlet, blah, blah, blah. She asked what I had connected to the TV. I told her the TV was wall-mounted and all that was connected was a soundbar.  She asked if I would connect the cable directly to the TV. I told her that it would be labor intensive and asked if there was something else we could test. She said sure, and we tested my laptop. She told me that she would \"see if I was eligible for a repair\" and placed me on hold for about 7 minutes.Upon her return, she said that \"unfortunately\" my setup isn't recommended and she needed to rule out that the soundbar isn't causing the issue. (I own a Vizio soundbar - how can it not be a recommended setup?) She said \"unfortunately\" there was nothing she could do for me unless I connected the cable directly to the TV. At that point I asked to speak to her supervisor.The \"executive supervisor\" proceeded to tell me that she could send out a person to diagnose the issue. I told her I don't want a bunch of strange people coming to my house for repairs and diagnostics. I wanted a replacement. She told me that I was not eligible for a replacement. Really? Three months ago I was. I asked if I should be satisfied with spending $1400 on a product to have it repaired every three months. She explained that if it is an issue that can be repaired, it will be repaired and not replaced. Two minutes prior she said that it doesn't make sense and is not cost-effective to keep having repairs done. ?I finally agreed to pull the tv stand out and re-route my cable directly to the TV, while kindly placing her on hold, of course. (This is after she interrupted me in mid-sentence and started talking over me. Great customer service!) She then tells me that the problem is my soundbar, not the TV. So my soundbar is causing the TV to turn off by itself?She reluctantly agreed to send out a repair technician. At least I think that's the plan.  She told me to expect a call from the repair company to schedule an appointment. I didn't even get my case number.Long review, but with my lemon TV and poor customer service, I will not be purchasing another Vizio product.**UPDATE**The TV repairman was unable to fix the issue with a replaced motherboard and power supply cord. I was told to expect a call from Vizio within 2 business days.  A week later, still no phone call. I called Vizio and again was placed on hold for approx. 7 minutes while my \"notes\" were being reviewed. The gentleman told me that they believed it was the sound bar causing the issue. I told him the TV was in a spare bedroom at this point and nothing was connected to it. We walked through more of the same troubleshooting steps with the same results.

Not a fatal flaw, but a little annoying.This replaced a 55\" LG Plasma that had amazing picture and sound, so I may be overly harsh because a LED can't really compare in picture quality and the 40% larger viewing area will also have an impact on picture quality.

This is an amazing deal at this price point. I also have a 46\" Samsung LED and while the picture quality of this unit isn't as good as the Samsung LED's out there, it is fairly close. The colors, clarity, and sharpness don't quite pop out at you like a Samsung but they also cost about $1000 more for the same size. People that give this one star due to this are crazy, if you want perfect, spend the extra money, for those who want a great picture and large screen without breaking the bank, than this might be your best bet (much better than the large 70\" Sharp LED's which I find too grainy on Blu Rays. I use OTA tv reception (no cable) and the HD is great, but with Blu Ray it is amazing. Stunning picture with Blu Rays. It does take some tweaking because right out of the box the picture is not impressive. I wonder if the last reviewer didn't take the time to adjust everything or their viewing distance is too close. My couch is about 12' to 13' from the tv, it helps to be about that far as the picture starts to degrade the closer you get. My Samsung is the same way so I don't fault the Vizio for this.Pros:-Great picture for the price-Colors are nice and vivid, bright screen with surprisingly great whites (unlike any plasma)-Internet/wifi built in is a plus at this priceCons:-Stand isn't great, pretty flimsy, but is suitable once in place-frame or bezel is very glossy and reflective (cheap plastic)-I have backlight bleeding through the left hand corners, not major, but mostly noticeable while viewing movies at night. Particularly when watching a movie in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.*** If you own this set, please comment to this post whether or not you experience this in dark rooms or at night, trying to figure out if this is normal across all sets or if I should replace it ****In summary, this is a $1300 TV (black friday was $1000 and Amazon will probably match Costco), so it should be reviewed as such. My point: If it were $500 you would get a million 5 star reviews, if it were $2500 you would get a bunch of 2's and 3's because you would expect perfection at that price. By considering a 65\" LED screen with wifi, I give it a 4 or 5 simply because the picture is better than you would expect at this price. I was actually pleasantly surprised after tweaking it how good it was. I expected a fair picture and thought I might have to return it and decide between a more expensive brand or getting a 60\" to save money.  Yeah, it has some flaws with the clouding, maybe even some slight banding issues that I rarely see, but its $1300!!!!

It took eleven days to receive it via pilot shipping. We plan to keep the tv as it is a nice set. We have found minor issues with vertical banding; fortunately  this is usually not noticeable.  The worst case has been when viewing the ps3 home screen.  The picture is fantastic for hd tv and good enough for sd tv. DVD and blue rays look great via ps3. Gaming on ps3 is very good, no noticeable lag.  Wide variation in input signals ( dish, ps3, wii, etc) requires tweaking to get colors acceptable. The smart tv and apps are clunky and slow, we don't need these features so it is no problem for us.  If we were rich we would probably consider a higher quality tv.Edit 12/21.  We lowered the rating to 3 stars.  The banding issue has become more distracting.  It shows up when camera is in motion like left-right  pan shots. We are afraid this will get worse over time.  It's possible  we will return.  It's too bad we have no local stores where we can see before buying. When the vertical bands are not noticeable, the picture is great.Edit 1/04.  We returned the tv to Amazon. Amazon's return policy was very good. We got another set at a local store, same model. This one has less banding, noticeable but tolerable. However, the remote doesn't work on the new tv and its not the remote. So we have to box it up and return (again). Because of the good price, we will give this TV one more chance.

Can't Be Beat! UPDATED", "Author": "Chris I", "ReviewID": "R1OAKVKAHNUY6Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Found that this TV has some Banding issues with it ... not horribly but very apparent when viewing certain things like fast action scenes where there is bright solid colored scenes (like sky or say a green football field). This of course has been an ongoing issue with these LCD LED TV's for some time and many are affected by this and unfortunately this one looks to be as well ... I have received a replacement and will see if the new one does it later tonight when I hook it up.Here is a link to what Banding is for you to be aware of what I am talking about: [...]3 Stars till if this is an issue. Great TV, awesome picture, but this banding is VERY hard to overlook.Just got it hooked up tonight and I have been tweaking with it for a few hours now.FYI when you connect the stand don't lay it on it's screen on something soft like it says in the instructions ... I put down couch cushions and it kinda pushed the screen in and when I first turned it on there was this HUGE white orb about 2 feet wide X about a foot tall .... I freaked out thinking the screen was screwed ... I took a soft shirt and started rubbing the screen and it went away ... I guess with these really thin TV when you put pressure the front film on the screen kinda presses against something behind it that does this i suppose ... just an FYI for you guys with your TV's in route when putting it together.I had a 70\" Sharp Costco model (3D version) a couple months ago and Hated it ... bad picture and the Halo / ghosting effect on certain programs and especially sports (football a lot) was UNBEARABLE ... I took it back within a few days ... I have been on the hunt for something around that size and since this came out for the price I HAD to at least give it a shot.Not gonna get to deep yet till I do more and give it another day or two but needless to say my MAIN issue with the last tv was the Ghosting / Halo effect around the players and certain things and with this TV that is almost not even there. I see it a little when I have the film mode turned on with the setting all crazy in Vivid mode and the contrast and brightness high ... but at close to optimal setting (all that junk off with better picture setting and tuned somewhat right) I don;t see that halo effect At All !!! That I am VERY happy about and so far and pleased with this set.The base is a little wobbly for my liking but stable enough (if you have kids maybe strap this securely to wall for added safety) ... the Menu is a little sluggish as well as the apps (have't opened any yet to see how the interface is for netflix, hulu, etc. yet) but I noticed when I set my Universal Remote that the menu moved a lot faster then using the stock remote. I like the keyboard on the back but it will never really get used so it will get stored and I will be using the Universal for everything like always.The picture look good so far ... still need to tweak it a bit more but good from what I can after an hour or two of messing with it.The one thing that I am not pleased so far with is the sound ... I know these TV's get bashed for sound but the Sharp I had was WAY better on sound ... the speaker and in the back and basically shoot out the back ... no front firing speaker at all. So I have this on a stand with about a foot and half open from the back of the tv to the wall so no matter what sound setting I have it it sounds hollow and to surround'ish (even though I turned surround off and left it flat and changed the Eq settings). I have a full surround sound set-up but I don't like running that unless I need the major sound for a show or a movie ... when I watch just basic programming I like using the TV's speakers .... these are really bad and I am now looking at some sort of sound bar that I can use and have on at all time for the main speakers for this set (I will put the bar behind the tv facing forward ... maybe that will help). This is one major issue for me since I know need to spend more money on basic sound.No 3D which many don't care for ... I actually do and wish it had that but I didn't want the 3D version of this TV ... it had the old style look as the one they have had out for like a year now plus I heard the screen is PURE Gloss ... Shows reflections like a plasma .... That is a no go ... I like the matte screen so it cuts down on all of that and I am sure this will do that (been dark since I got it home so not sure how it looks yet, but looked good on reflections in the store).Menu is pretty basic as far as all the advanced settings you can get into on some of the higher priced tv's ... but just enough to give you the picture you are probably looking for (for the price you won;t get all of those crazy settings).Another thing I don't like is the 3 HDMI's .... all TV's should have a minimum of 4 ... I know have my Blu-ray that needs to be swapped out with another active device when I need to use it. I will one day be upgrading my Denon receiver with the HDMI pass-throughs so I will really only need one input on the tv.Well that's about what I know about this TV so far after getting it home a few hours ago... just wanted to report.I will follow up in the next day or two for more findings as I mess with his bad boy more.But in closing so far ... for the price of this thing and the size and the things it has, this thing is a Great Deal!!!! I would not hesitate if you are looking at something in this size range for this price (take my word for it stay away from the sharps).", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good picture quality...", "Author": "Ricardo Portal \"atlga30005\"", "ReviewID": "R1BKG2LIIG3MYK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "not a sony or panasonic, but a 65-inch for $1,250 is very good.

I came to the  conclusion that the LED was a better choice. The picture has no reflective  glare; in fact when the sun shines directly on the picture you can only  tell by looking at the black base. This is far superior to our rear projection  although not bad direct light was always visible.Second  The brand, I love my Sony products but they have little to offer in affordable  TV's anymore, so we needed a new brand that has a good reputation for lasting a  user friendly options, plus it had to be adaptable to our other home theater  appliances.  We had visited this brand of TV at different stores(Sam's club, best buy and  BJ's wholesale club) and found that we liked the vizio picture better then  most, plus the price was within our budget. Reading the reviews we were happy  with the majority of  opinions offered.Third-  Size, our Sony was a 60 inch the TV needed to be 60 or more and putting it a  large room the 65 inch with a little higher price was a no-brainier.Finally the picture is beautiful, watching a movie in blue-ray looks almost 3D. There is no motion blur on most HD channels and if the program is broadcast in HD quality I can't find a flaw. We did adjust the picture to our liking on some channels the picture was too sharp, but making the adjustments was easy.

I want the best, and if it's not the best, it should still perform like the best.  If it doesn't perform like the best, it should at least perform commensurate with the price paid.  This television does not meet that criteria and was returned within a week.My specific problems with this television had nothing to do with the poor speakers or wobbly base.  Really, if you're interested buying a television this size you should have a great amplified sound system and wall/entertainment mount to go with it.  Those cannot be seen as 'cons' because they shouldn't be used anyway.  My problem is with the picture and the actual television.Banding and ghosting are TERRIBLE with this television.  So bad my 6yr old noticed it.  If you don't know what those terms mean, google it and you'll find they're the things that make you NOT want to buy a specific television.  Any scene that had shadows, fog, or really any significant variance in lighting resulted in banding and halos so distracting that my company was immediately removed from the fantasy of the movie and commented on the poor picture quality.  That's not to mention the pixelation looked like an atari was used for the video processor.If we suspend belief that consumers interested in a 70'' television aren't interested in picture quality, we still have a major downfall with the operating system (?) this TV uses.  First thing when unboxing was to install the Vizio updates.  Second was to adjust the picture settings.  Neither did any good - Your TV will frequently freeze when changing inputs or moving through menus, requiring you to flip your surge protector on and off to reset the TV.

This is a very heavy (85 lb) TV and you will not want to lift if up more than necessary.I replaced a 3D TV with this, so I did not need my Vizio 3D Blu-ray any more. And since I never use the Blu-ray for movies, it was no loss.Instead I am using a previously neglected Xbox 360 for apps, music and games, as well as watching my DVD's from Teaching Company and other movies (but we generally stream, so it's no impact really). There are some apps that the Vizio has that Xbox doesn't (and vice-versa), so I can switch back and forth if need be. But the Xbox has a web browser, so I can get to Pandora, TunedIn, I Heart Radio, etc. I used the side mount HDMI port, since that is the only port I am using. Getting to the ports in back of the TV once it's mounted is a bit tough.I bought an Xbox remote control, and used the ridiculously easy programming method to make the TV work, so now instead of all the remotes I had, I can generally use just one remote for everything. I am digging that a lot.I have a Bose Cinemate system that I figured out how to use with this TV. TIP: The (SINGLE) analog audio out is a 3.5mm jack on the side of the TV. There are NO RCA jacks. If you have an RCA surround sound setup, you will need to buy an adapter (like http://www.amazon.com/Dynex-Mini-Stereo-Audio-Cable/dp/B0032JAG4G/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1363115431&sr;=1-3&keywords;=rca+stereo+audio+cable+6ft). Again, buy this first. They are cheap.Even though I have the Bose, I am combining the audio from that with the built in surround sound on the TV. The sound quality from the TV alone is very good. Between the two, I have almost theater quality sound.I should point out that I do not use cable or dish, or even antennae, but rely mostly on Hulu Plus and Netflix, and this TV supports them both flawlessly.In summary, so far, so good with this setup. It's big, beautiful, sounds great and is very simple to operate.

The vertical banding (about four vertical strips of somewhat darker lines of about one inch wide) while there it is not highly noticeable. But it may vary unit to unit. Blacks have no clouding on my set but corners are slightly brighter w/o flash lighting. Watching letter boxed materials in darkened room shows slightly elevated black on the right and left but no distracting flash lighting.Sound is good and better than other flats I have had. Remote is gimicky and bottons are small and hate the ticking sound upon pressing.Case and stand are high quality.My only disappointment is slow power up time of about 35 seconds.

I did not purchase this TV online instead I waited 6 hours in the cold on Black Friday for a pos. I was still within my 90 day warranty when our first tv broke in late Jan. Sam's club would not let me exchange it because they no longer sell this model. They would give me what I paid for it but it was Black Friday price of $998, to buy the exact same tv would cost me $1300. Even the manager said if he was us he wouldn't do it! Little did we know that would be just the beginning of our journey. We contacted Vizio on Feb 5th, on Feb 9th the repair man came to \"fix\" our tv which he could not do, Feb 15th Vizio ordered us a guaranteed brand new tv. Finally, today, Feb 28th we finally received our \"new\" tv.  The delivery guys let us know that they have been picking up the same model broken tv around 10 times a day! (Mostly ones bought on Black Friday) They put our \"new\" tv together and told us to wait a half hour before plugging it in. We waited over a hour (it's almost 2pm now) to plug it in, around 5:35pm the \"new\" tv went out AGAIN! It didn't even last 4 hours!!!!! You have got to be joking me! The reason I say \"new\" is because when I called customer service they informed me that we did not receive a new tv, we received a re-certified tv. A re-ceritified tv is a tv that was sitting around at a store for so long that they gave it back to the company. Well, thank you so much for another piece of crap. Now we get to wait how much longer for a \"new\" tv? You would think that since it took almost a month for us to get a new tv they would do something to make up for it. NOT! They won't even express ship it. We get to get the same model tv yay hopefully it won't take over 3 weeks again. Our problem with the TV's has been the same. You are watching it and it turns itself off but the Vizio light on the bottom stays lit and is actually brighter. It will turn back on but only for maybe a minute if your lucky. We then discovered that after a couple seconds the remote and side buttons on the tv stop working. I'm writing this for buyers to beware. I read many good reviews on the tv before buying but after the delivery drivers told us how many of these tv's they returned in a week I want people to realize that this is obviously a big problem that other buyers aren't talking about. It did take almost 90 days for our first tv to break so if you do decided to buy this tv I HIGHLY SUGGEST buying the extended warranty if we wouldn't have and our tv would have lasted just a couple more days before it broke, we would be stuck with a broken tv.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "5th time around ahhh!", "Author": "pilotman", "ReviewID": "R26V0416AZY04F", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Initially bought the 60inch for christmas, but as with many others, the picture went out. Seems to be a common problem with the 60 inch. Amazon happily returned it and gave me a refund.  Read up the reviews for the 65 inch and it did not appear to have this issue so I bought a used one a month ago. It came to the house within a few days and the delivery guy set it up. But the remote was not communicating with the tv. Changed batteries but still was not working. So the delivery guy took it back with him. Called Amazon and they gave me a refund so I just ordered another used 65 thinking it was just a fluke. It came a week later but another issue!!!!!!!!! This time there were no screws included to attach the TV stand!! So the delivery guy took it back again and amazon refunded me. IF Amazon is going to sell used items, shouldn't they make sure that the item works and all the parts are included???!!! This time Amazon did credit me some money for my troubles. Roll the dice again??? Like the fool I am, trying to save a couple hundred bucks I did again. The TV came last Wednesday and guess what???! The screws were missing again!!!!! Again, the delivery guy took it back with him. This time amazon is sending a new 65inch instead of used at no cost for my troubles. TV comes tomorrow. It has to work this time right?...its brand new. will update when I get the TV. To anyone thinking about buying a used TV: DONT DO IT!!!!!!!!

So far, I've had 2 bad tv's sent to me.EDIT 2: Another reason to NOT contact vizio...flaky customer service. I spoke lastnight to a CSR 'Aubrey' who took all my information, then informed me that I would need to send her the receipt for the tv blah blah blah and that she would be sending me an email with the information. Guess what? It never came. So I call back, and I get to speak to 'Kayla'. She informs me that before we can do anything, I need to register my TV. Keep in mind, the first thing the TV asks you to do when you turn it on, is to register. I'm at work at this point, so I can't give her the serial number off the TV or the box, so that was just a waste of 40 minutes. This whole process has turned into a nightmare, and VIZIO isn't interested in making their customers happy. Enjoy your TV's everyone, hopefully you'll never have to call in with a problem!I'll preface this by saying I've already contacted amazon for a replacement.Now, what would have been a FANTASTIC tv, was ruined by a very strange problem. I can turn the tv on, select an input, maybe change the channel a few times, but then the tv is completely unresponsive. Whatever input I'm viewing is displayed properly, but the tv doesn't respond to user input. Volume control doesn't work, Channel up/down doesn't work, even the power buttons don't work!!Aside from that problem, and only having 3 hdmi inputs, everything else was great. The picture is excellent, and the sound is acceptable for tv speakers. I didn't get much time to mess around with the apps due to the freezing, but I'll check that out when my replacement gets here.Hopefully the next one will actually work!!", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible Customer Service", "Author": "I Peterson", "ReviewID": "R60XXG3M8NKKY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my father for Christmas, as a major surprise.The only major surprise was that it was defective.  We discovered this surprise after hiring contractors to come out to hang the thing at $60 per hour.Now, my dad has no TV to watch the bowl games on.  All of the wires are in the back of the TV.I called Amazon and--Surprise!--they're out of stock.  Here are my options:1. GET A REFUND - I paid $1398 for this TV as a Christmas sale.  I'm not going to find another 65\" TV for $1398.  Poor option.2. WAIT FOR A REPLACEMENT - They told me that they might never get these back in stock, so I could be waiting for a long time.  Meanwhile, the wires are in the wall and my dad isn't watching TV.  Poor option.3. GET $100 PROMO CREDIT FOR MY TROUBLE - This promo credit can only be applied to TVs Amazon has in stock.  They don't have 65\" Vizios in stock, but they do have 70\" TVs for $1899.  With the $100 credit, I will \"only\" have to pay an additional $400 for a TV as good or better as the one they were supposed to send me.I complained up the supervisor ladder, and they eventually offered me a $200 promotional credit.  So in the end Amazon only held me hostage for $300 that I shouldn't have had to pay them.  In the meanwhile, I will wait until January 4 for my TV to be delivered, and we will be watching the bowl games at a local sports bar.Whether or not you think that this policy is fair, this provides an excellent example of why people should NOT buy large items that take a long time to ship online when there are suitable alternatives in the store.CostCo sold this TV for $1298 plus shipping, so essentially the same price.
