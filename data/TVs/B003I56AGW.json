S \"M.S.\"", "ReviewID": "RXOT1EV9W737R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I worked as a quality tester for the doomed Cablevision VOOM HD project in the early days of HDTV.  Plus I've owned three other HDTVs (2 DLP and 1 LCD) since then, so i have a base to compare - not my first experience with Hi-Def TV.This Mitsubishi WD-73838 is a monster compared to my old 50 inch Samsung (see pic).  The overall picture on this set is excellent, but i would not say that the picture quality is THAT much better than my 3-year old Samsung HL-T5076S (also 3D capable).  Back then, it was a very good set for picture quality and even today it can still hang with the best of them.  I paid ~$1300 for the Samsung three years ago and ~$1700 before tax/delivery for the 73\" Mitsu just last week @ Electronics Expo.  The price was great!!  And definitely worth it just for the sheer size of the screen - a very good upgrade.The sound on this unit is pretty good, with all those speakers... but lets face it - if you are buying a huge home theater TV, you probably already own a good 7.1 AVR that supports all the surround sound HD formats. And if you dont - you should.3D quality (updated below): For now, my experience on this TV with 3D content is limited to Motorsport 3D game for the PS3.  But even in 720p and scaled down for 3D it looks excellent.  Looking forward to seeing some of the 3D BD movies soon in higher 1080p.For 3D you WILL need the 3DA1 adapter for any 3D source that doesn't support checkerboard or side by side formats (see update #2 below!). Also, know that x102 DLP Link glasses are cheaper and will work well, but there is a known issue with them - they seem to lose the link to the TV if you are too far or the bulb is not bright enough.  At 10 feet they start to flicker on and off, at 12 feet it's very hard to maintain the link.  They also have a proprietary battery and rape you on shipping charges, so that may be an issue for some folks.Read up on HDTV and 3D before you buy!!! know all the options, formats and downsides!!! avsforums . com is an excellent source of info on the subject.As far as what other users report about 30-60 sec boot up times....  I guess it's true if the TV power is controlled by the cable box or if you turn the TV on for the first time after there was a (brief) power outage.  If the TV is plugged into a wall jack  (not into the cable box that controls the power supply to the TV set) meaning the TV still gets some power even when it's shut off, then it takes about 10-15 seconds to boot up.  Remember this is a projection TV and a sophisticated one at that, just like a computer it takes time to boot up.  After i plugged the TV into a wall outlet, in my experience the boot times have been very short.UPDATE #1 (Nov 2010): Well, after several months of ownership i am even more happy with this TV.  Regular picture is still amazing, watching Great Migrations on NatGeo HD is simply incredible.  The 3D is very sharp and there is no ghosting.  The best glasses i was able to find were the viewsonics and optomas (they seem to be identical) right here on amazon. @ ~85 bucks a pair you can get several pairs for the friends and family.  Some of the deepest and amazing 3D picture and effects i've were on IMAX: Deep Sea, Disney's A Christmas Carol and IMAX: Grand Canyon Adventure (even though this one was not pretty boring)UPDATE #2 (Dec 2010): Make sure you update the TV firmware (available on the Mitsubishi site)!  Eliminates the need for the 3D adapter, adds support for all the 1.4a required 3D formats.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good tv for the size", "Author": "marco_mendoza", "ReviewID": "R1ALLJ05PLGCY7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would first like to state that i own a Sony and Toshiba LED backlit LCD televisions.I have never seen the samsung LED DLP screens or the laservue DLP.I will be making this comparison solely compared to my other LED LCD televisions.I do not yet own any 3D movies or equipment.Pros:  PICTURE:number one is the size of this screen, i love it! it is great for HDTV and HD movies. Image is very clear and crisp.it has 120hz witch is much better against motion blur. it has advanced video calibration options. i just went to [...] and used the settings there.  INTERNET TV:I also enjoy the wireless Internet. it has movies and it has news. my favorite feature is the ticker option. you can have a ticker at the bottom of your TV with facebook on it as well as other apps.  SOUND:The 16 speakers surround sound are very amazing! you can calibrate the sound with the microphone provided.SIZE/WEIGHT: This TV is very light its almost as light as my 46\" LED TV. I could easily lift it with another person. i don't think i would have needed another person but its better safe than sorry.Cons:  POWER-ON/off: During power on it takes a few moments to come on during this time it displays a Mitsubishi start up screen kinda like a computer.it also does this for powering off(shutdown screen like a PC)  PICTURE: overall video is very good but not as good as my LED 120hz Toshiba. it is not as crisp and takes a few moments to fully brighten.Its not as good as my Toshiba for use as a computer monitor using the HDMI inputs.I would say the difference is very minimal.  INTERNET TV: the wireless tv requires you to buy an additional proprietary Mitsubishi AzureWave AW-NU231 Wireless Adapter. It also takes a minute for the internet TV to initially load.you also have to type with the remote control, not very fun.usb ports for the wifi adapter are in bad spots(one on back and one on rear side). they should be on top or directly on the sides. there is one on the side but it is being obstructed by the screen. causing it to loose signal strength. on top would be the ideal spot.  Sound: now that i have had a taste of the surround sound. I notice what it is lacking. A nice sub-woofer. now i gotta buy one because with one it would sound even better.Heat: this TV makes some heat out of the rear by the lamp area. it might be good for the winter but not very helpful for the summer.Conclusion:  Overall this is a very good product i mainly bought it because they do not make a LED LCD screen in this size for this price.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Firmware upgrade makes this TV even better!", "Author": "rxa777", "ReviewID": "R37LBB9WA0OQNT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I connected a HD DVR Satellite receiver, Sony Blu Ray Player, and Phillips DVR to this tv (WD-73838).  First chance I got, I connected this TV to the internet.  Per the 3D upgrade instructions, the firmware was automatically downloaded while the TV was off that night.  (went from version 012.03 to 012.06)  I did not connect the adapter box that came in the 3D adapter kit.  I connected only the emitter and put batteries in the glasses.  I turned on the Sony 3D player and set the tv to 3D automatic.  The 3D picture displayed just great using the emitter controlled shutter glasses.  I turned off the Sony, and turned on the Satellite Receiver to the free 3D channel.  Again I set the TV to 3D and saw side by side pictures on the screen (picture on the left half of the tv and a duplicate on the right half)  My TV settings were still on 3D and automatic.  I switched to the side by side option on the TV and the whole screen went to one great looking 3D picture.  This is without use of the adapter box that comes in the kit (the firmware upgrade did indeed eliminate needing it on models 738, 838, and future models.  The TV apparrently remembers the settings because the next time I turned on the Sony Blu Ray Player, which simultaneously turned on the TV, a list of choices (like internet, movies, etc) displayed on the TV screen with BD currently highlighted.  I pressed the Select / OK button on the Sony remote and the TV automatically went into 3D mode.  I found similarities with Plasma Tv's.  You can watch the Mitsubishi DLP with your head in any comfortable position, including laying down on a sofa!!  Word of warning, don't put any major pressure on the glasses lenses as they can twist, crack, and become useless.  I learned this info from a store saleman who had a set that someone either dropped on a hard floor, or pulled too hard on the sides while putting on or removing the glasses.  The glasses were not cracked to speak of, but had become partially streaked because of excess stress to the lenses.  I have each of the three components connected to the TV via HDMI cable and directly to my surround sound audio receiver by way of digital coax or optical cable, so I can control when I want the extra sound.  This is an exceptionlly great TV.  I too bought a TV stand at IKEA, but went with one that only cost $59.00 (that is correct fifty-nine dollars).  The table is only 14 inches high, 59 inches in length, and 20 inches deep.My satellite receiver, blu-ray player, and dvr are all side by side on the bottom shelf with plenty of room between each one.  The TV is on a 14 inch by 37 inch stand that holds the TV about two inches above the TV stand.  The stand is rated for TV's to 168 pounds.  The low table height places the center of the screen closest to eye center position.  This is somewhat important with DLP's because that gives the viewer the best view, specially 3D.  We sit at 13 feet from the TV on an L shaped sofa set.  The closest seat is about 8 feet and about 45 degrees from the screen center.  The view is still exceptionally great even at that point!", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Make sure you have HD programming", "Author": "A. Vega", "ReviewID": "R1YNNXPV0W31ZF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I first hooked this massive 73\" Diamond Series t.v. up I was a little disappointed with the picture quality. I have standard cable service. However, my cable company does send out a few HD channels with my service, so when I switched to those channels the picture came alive!! Now I have to upgrade to all HD to truly appreciate this t.v. Be careful with the size you choose, I really wanted the 82\" version but it would have been too big for the room it was going in.Some PROS:1) This t.v only weighs about 90 lbs. and although it looks top heavy, it really is quite stable.2) The 16 speakers sounds great so far, I have yet to hook up a subwoofer.3) The Audio and Video Set-Up is pretty easy to navigate.4) Channel Guide is nice but I do hate it when you constantly have to update it to get channel information.Some CONS:1) Cheap remote...is it too much to ask for to get one with back-lit buttons?2) No picture-in-picture...would have been nice, given the size of this t.v. both screens would've been fairly decent sized compared with smaller t.v.'s with P-IN-P.3) It takes about 35 sec. from the time you turn on the power to the time the t.v. turns on and fully brightens.4) When playing DVD's the picture darkens and you have to adjust the pic. controls to brighten it up. Then when you swith back to t.v. input the picture is way too bright and you have to adjust pic. controls to darken a little...very annoying.I didn't buy this t.v. for the 3D experience, but I will later update when I purchase the glasses. I did buy it for the StreamTV that I haven't hooked up yet. I will update my review once I do.Also, save your money and don't buy the over-priced cheesey t.v. stand that is supposedly made just for this t.v. If you have an IKEA nearby. Buy the Besta Burs t.v stand for $249.00 it fits perfectly with inches to spare on both sides. It comes in various colors. I chose glossy black and it looks awesome. plus there are 3 flip down doors for your components and 2 huge drawers on each side for storage. You can even not install the three flip down drawers and shelving and just leave the center open if you need that space for better component storage, it will still look great.", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Big Screen!", "Author": "Jean-Luc Girardet", "ReviewID": "R1HG12S3P37053", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to go in a big room. When you need a 73 inch screen, there is not much choice out there. The TV came on the day it was supposed to come, the delivery guy unpacked it and would have placed it on our TV stand if the old TV had not been there. No problem, my wife and I had no trouble picking it up and placing it on the stand, and we are not body-builders. The start-up is a little slow, but after reading previous reviews, I thought it was not as bad as I anticipated. The big disapointment is the way the picture is set at the factory. A lot of adjustements need to be made before getting good skin tones. I eventually got it to my liking. I probably need to get a professional for fine-tuning, but as it is, it's good enough. Regular TV looks OK, but it's really Blue Ray that will blow your mind. The first evening, we watched Avatar, and it was just amazing. Football games in HD are also awesome. On the negative side, the remote is cheap-looking, but I don't use it, except for switching from one HDMI input to the other. The sound is OK, it comes from the front of the TV, and it is adequate for TV shows and news. For movies, I have a 5.1 system hooked up. There is minimum glare on the screen, color uniformity is very good for a DLP, and off-angle viewing is much better than older-generation projection TVs. Very happy with my purchase, but Mitsu should ship his TV with a better factory setting; why wouldn't you want your customers to be \"wowed\" right out the box?Update June 2011: After several months of hesitation and research, I bought 4 pairs of 3D glasses. This TV does NOT need any IR transmitter, no adapter to buy: it works just fine with the DLP link, which synchronizes 3D glasses through a signal sent by the screen itself (you need to buy the right glasses of course). I was skeptical, but it works really well. I bought 4 pairs of DLP Link glasses (sold by Amazon), Hi-Shock Model ND2G. Nice glasses, they had very good reviews, and they work really well. You need to set the 3D TV menu to DLP link, signal on automatic, and it works. I have a PS3 connected, and I just watched Tron 3D. Outstanding!Two things to keep in mind: the 3D player has to be connected directly to the TV via a HDMI 1.4. The signal was not going through my Harman Kardon AVR 247 receiver. Newer models may work. Second thing: the left/right signal is often inverted. If the 3D looks fuzzy, or blurry, go back to the TV menu, in the 3D section, and choose \"reverse\" for left/right signal. When I do that, wow. The way I knew I had to do it? I put my glasses upside down, and I noticed a much better 3D effect... so it's your choise: keep the signal normal and wear the glasses upside down, or change the setting in the menu and wear the glasses normally. Easy choise I think ;)", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Oh My GOD !!!!!!!!!", "Author": "sr jr x ta \"the whole f'n show\"", "ReviewID": "RZZU0J0LWPG7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "read this review only forget the rest.picture quality is great. for those who say it isn't aren't ready for an hd tv. if you connect hdmi or component to this set you get you moneys worth. only a fool would use composite [red white yellow] or coaxial. with the proper hd connections OH MY GOD. 4 hdmi inputs and 2 component. to take fulladvantage of what this tv offers buy blu ray or hd dvd [WHAT] YES I SAID HD DVD the hd dvd format is no longer an option in stores BUT YOU CAN GET AN HD DVD PLAYER FOR LIKE $30 TO $50 ON AMAZON/EBAY/WHEREVER AND ON AMAZON YOU CAN BUY HD MOVIES AND BUILD A COLLECTION WITH MOVIES FOR THE TOTAL PRICE OF LIKE $3 TO $5 EACH SAME TITLES AS BLU RAY SAME QUALITY WAY LESS AND IN PURE 1080P.3d quality is 2nd to none. this tv does not i repeat DOES NOT need that adapter kit all you need is the glasses and the emitter. save your money on that kit. glasses that work for this are the samsung 2100ab glasses.sound quality is superb. now all others say the sound isn't that good. ignore them they are simple. the tv says built in in surrond 16 speakers.

I ended up choosing this TV because it was packed with features such as 3d capability, optional wifi (with an adapter), and 1080p hi-definition in a VERY large screen.When the TV arrived in my home, it looked gargantuan.  I anticipated it to be heavy and thick.  But, surprisingly, it really was not.  In fact, the TV can be moved by two people without any strain.  The only difficulty is dealing with the huge dimensions and making sure you have clearance.To accommodate the TV, I recommend buying an appropriately sized stand or piece of furniture.  This will make the viewing experience better.  I opted for the Hooker Furniture, model 367-55-452, entertainment console (see:  [..]) and it fit perfectly.As for the set:When you first turn it on, it makes a little hum, the screen lights up, and shows a Mitsubishi icon.  It then tunes to the channel, input, internet, or whatever you have it set to watch.  Also, the TV \"knows\" when you plug in a new device and makes it easy to select that device as an input.  The options for customizing the brightness, color, and view (wide angle, standard, etc.) are numerous.  As I am not a big tech person, I haven't played around with this very much.  But, I found that it is best on the bright setting.The picture quality is superb and parallels what I've seen from most LCD and Plasma TVs.  No complaints.  Sound quality is also good.As for the optional WiFi, I purchased the adapter and have used the streaming video services on this TV.  Most of it isn't that notable or exciting, but I do like Vudu, Pandora, and the ability to show photos via Picasa.  Vudu has a decent selection of movies and they stream clearly on this TV.In my view, the only negatives are this:  1) the remote control is not lighted; 2) it takes a couple minutes to \"cool down\" after you turn it off to preserve the DLP bulb; 3) not as thin as the new LCDs or Plasma.The \"positives\" of the set are the enormous size (which is just not attainable for this price via another option), picture quality, wifi, and 3d ability.  Although DLP is labeled as an older technology, Mitsubishi has definitely made it very high tech with this set and you can be assured that it has more \"wow\" factor than you would have with a smaller flat screen LCD.  Also, as some may not be aware, the DLP set actually uses LESS power than many plasma and LCD televisions.  Furthermore, if the bulb burns out (and it will), you simply replace it.  If a pixel burns out on an LCD, you're basically done with it.Overall, I really like this TV so far.  I just ordered the 3d adapter.  Once I have used that, I'll update the review.UPDATE:I have the 3d starter kit.  While you can buy an emitter and glasses, I figured I'd just go with the starter kit because the cost is about the same (i.e. buying two sets of glasses plus an emitter is only a little cheaper) and it'd work right out of the box.  Although I've only watched the promo DVD, I have to say that the 3d is AWESOME.  Better than you may have seen in a movie theater as a kid.  It's crystal clear and the images really pop out of the screen.  This TV is wonderful for the 3d.  I look forward to getting more 3d content to watch on it.  Unfortunately, the discs seem to be around $30+ right now and there is few streaming 3d content from what I can tell.  But, still, this is a great thing to have for when it really hits mainstream.

I also purchased the base made by Mitsubishi that complements the TV very nicely.My speakers are of about the same depth as the TV, which makes them align beautifully.

They told me that they don't come over and that we need to deliver it.Now I bought from Amazon, it was shipped to me, and this tv is 73 inches.  How is that going to fit in my car?

I have no idea how they do it but we found ourselves turning our heads to look to the side or behind us at certain times in movies or even watching sports when you hear voices and sounds coming from different directions. That's awesome!The only reason I rated 4 stars rather than 5 is that we only used the TV for two weeks before the lamp blew out.

It had dropped in price by over a thousand dollars in that span of a year.Awesome TV!  Setup was easy, picture is great, and I don't see us ever going to the theater again.  It's all about adjusting what you feel is a new release-- new release in the theater?, or new release where I can go get it at RedBox?  From now on, a movie doesn't even exist in my mind until it hits the RedBox.The 16 speakers sound good enough, but it is necessary to add a subwoofer (obviously).Personally, I like the matte screen because I have light sources to the left and right, and it really helps diffuse the glare.I bought a stand from IKEA in the Besta Burs series.  Instead of the one-piece (which I thought looked kinda cheesy), I bought a smaller stand that had a side add-on (making it as big as the one-piece).  TV fits perfectly on this, with a few inches on either side-- and cabinets and a drawer.This item was sold by Walt's and fulfilled by Amazon.  The fulfillment part originally left me less than \"fulfilled\".  Delivery #1 came and the box had a big hole in the front-right corner, with the corner of the TV damaged.  Refused delivery.  Delivery #2 a week later came and was ok.  I will say, however, that when I called Amazon about the damage problem, Nikki took care of me.  The first person I spoke with kept using words like \"I'm sorry\" and \"We can't do that\".  I asked to speak with her manager, and got Nikki.

Did you know Mitsubishi warrants the TV Screen for 30 DAYS!!!!Just after its 3 year anniversary in my home the screen is showing white light in two areas about the size of a drop of water. It would appear like bad pixels in an LED TV. Very distracting to watch a movie with white light showing in two places. I have called the local Mitsu service shop and have an estimate of approximately $1000.00. I figure the heat from the lamp deteriorates the screen making it brittle and it finally just drops particles right off. The repair is to install a new screen inside the TV. It actually is attached to the inside of the clear outside hard part. My question is why doesn't Mitsubishi just install a continuous and better fan to remove the damaging heat??

They then told me they were sending two boards. a week later I call the TV shop they still haven't gotten the parts. so i call Mitsubishi they closed my file and never sent the parts. It's almost a month now and I'm a little pissed. $1900 for 4 months of TV. Several people warned me about this but I didn't listen. Never again!

By the end of September, I was receiving a high pitched noise coming from the TV.  On October 4th, I contacted Mitsubishi to try to fix the issue.  It took me about a week and numerous phone call before they diagnosed it as a COLOR WHEEL issue.  Wow, there was a surprise, I figured that out before I even called them.  It apparently is a well-known issue with these TVs.  Unfortunatly, I didn't find this out on my initial search on it.  I figured it was no big deal.  So, on October 11th or 12th, Mitsubishi scheduled me with a company that is 2 1/2 hours from my house to fix my TV for Monday, October 17th.  The company was supposed to call me to verify the appointment.  I didn't hear from them until Tuesday, October 18th.  Apparently, they don't work on Mondays.  So, I asked them to schedule me on Friday, 10/21, or Saturday, 10/22, since I would be home.  They told me they didn't know when they would be in my area to fix it.  I still haven't heard from them.  Well, on November 2nd or 3rd, I decided it was time that Mitsubishi give me something for my pain and suffering.  So, I called and asked them for a 3D starter kit or a TV stand.  They were nice enough to comp me a replacement lamp when I need it.  Fine.  So, I asked the Mitsubishi supervisor to also schedule me with a company closer to me.  They scheduled me with a company that is 20 minutes from my house and the supervisor promised me they would call me by the end of the day.  I still haven't heard from them.  Well, that was it.  I called Mitsubishi again today and was scheduled with yet another company.  Then I was transferred to something called Mitsubishi customer relations...what a load of crap...I told them it was time to pony up something else for what I told the guy was the \"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM A COMPANY.\"  This guy told me he couldn't do anything more for me...I asked him...\"Is this Customer Relations?\" and he said \"Yes\".  So I was assuming that I was talking to someone who could authorize some good will for such crappy service.  He said he was a case manager, but not my case manager, and they didn't have access to anything like the stand or 3D kit.  Wow, Mitsubishi makes these things that are on their website and they can't authorized anything.  YEAH RIGHT.  So, I am currently waiting for my so-called case manager to call me back and for my 3rd repair company to get a hold of me.  I will be calling Amazon to see what can be done about this.
