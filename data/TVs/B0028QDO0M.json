{"Reviews": [{"Title": "AWESOME LITTLE TV...", "Author": "Rikjay", "ReviewID": "R1NXOXIDBMUXNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little TV is great for a kitchen or as a small tv for a guest room or childs room. The remote is simple and concise. Setup is a breeze. Wall mounts easily. The picture is excellent. The viewing angle is excellent. I researched alot of 19\" LCD TV's and decided on this one. Many other 19\" tv's have a poor viewing angle...this one does not. The picture is clear. You will not go wrong with this TV. I have mine connected to a small radio shack Hi-DEF off-air antenna for the kitchen. I was amazed that I gets over 20 HD channels on it. The antenna is small and mounted outside. I would really compare this TV to Sony, Samsung. Its just as good. Not to mention the price..wow..it was about the same price as the bargain, off-brand TV\"s. You wont go wrong with this little beauty! Youll see every pimple on American Idol! Whew hooh!!!!", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "OK...But Has It's Issues", "Author": "Stanley M.", "ReviewID": "R2THM5GGIYE9C9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After having owned this TV for over a month I decided that an honest review was in order,First the Positives: This is an inexpensive LCD TV by a name manufacturer. It is lightweight, portable, attractive and easy to hook up. It has a wonderful picture provided that you are watching well lit indoor scenes or outdoor sporting events.The remote control has all of the functions necessary to set up picture and sound preferences and is much easier than using the small buttons located on the right side panel of the TV.Now for the Negatives: Most of the negatives can be overlooked as being relatively minor. Many have complained about the sound on this TV. It is not very good. It is rather tinny but keep in mind this is a small TV with not much space to put larger, better sounding speakers. You can adjust the bass and treble through the audio settings on the menu. This does help some. The solution to this problem is to just add external speakers through the audio out jack on the back of the TV or through audio output jacks on a cable box if you have one.LCD TV's unlike old picture tube tvs have to be viewed from certain angles to give you the true benefit of the picture. If the viewer is much higher then the height of the TV the picture will look very bright and washed out. If the viewer is below the height of the TV the picture can look very dark. A \"tiltable\" base would have helped to remedy this issue. This again can be remedied by buying a wall mount.The major complaint I have with this TV is the very poor contrast ratio that it has in dark indoor scenes as well as outdoor night scenes. Programs such as \"CSI\" which feature a lot of dimly lit indoor scenes are brutally dark. Blacks and Reds look inky with low contrast.I spent a lot of time calibrating and recalibrating the picture options. I read up a lot on how to do this and although I finally improved somewhat on the picture it still is darker then what it should be.Another important issue which I don't think anyone has mentioned. This is an energy saving unit...and although that is good for your electric bill it is not so great for your picture. Most LCD TVS have something known as either \"AUTO DIM\" or \"DCR (dynamic contrast ratio)\". What that does is automatically dim and brighten your backlighting as the LCD deems necessary. This annoying dimming and brightening is most active during well lit sporting events (such as a baseball game). Larger more expensive sets have a menu option to disable this. You cannot disable it on this set.If I had too do it over again I would not buy this set. On the other hand I am not that unhappy where I would return it. For it's price it is OK.For those interested the following are what I found to be the best calibrations for this TV (in TV viewing mode). Please note you MUST set individual calibration settings for EACH input (dvd, pc, etc.)Brightness: 40Contrast:30-35Sharpness: 30Tint: 5Color:13-15 (personal preference..but anything higher seems \"cartoonish\"Temperature: Cool (personal preference)Backlight: 8 (the higher the backlight the more contrast you lose)***DNR (digital noise reduction): OFF...The factory default is \"ON\". Having the setting \"ON\" will remove fine detail from your picture.I hope this helps someone.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great 19\" TV", "Author": "Megan Scarlett \"megs\"", "ReviewID": "RJDSGFLD2Q1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this 19\" TV to replace an older CRTV I had in my guest bedroom and so far I have been very happy with my purchase.

LOONEY", "ReviewID": "R4JZJW8JKJPUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV less than a day and I consider this my best purchase from Amazon.  It took me a total of 15 minutes to have the base attached, cable hooked up, and programed. I had looked at RCA, LG, Vizio, Samsung and several others and I am very happy with my choice.  I have a small apartment and my TV sets on a rolling tv cart so I can move it back when I am thru watching it. So, I was impressed with the large base and stability.  The TV I had before was a Coby 15 inch, and while that is a good TV, it can't compare to this one.  I would suggest adding speakers to your purchase.  I had ordered Altec Lansing speakers from Amazon before and they work perfect with this TV.  The speakers hook into the headphones jack on the back of the tv and you still have a headphone jack on the speakers.  The appearance of the tv is great and the size is just right.  I had looked at 19, 22, 24, and even 26.  I am sure glad I choose this size.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good For Compact Spaces", "Author": "J H Murphy \"Hank Murphy\"", "ReviewID": "R3565DIIKRZ1D7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My father was recently hospitalized and is now spending much more time in bed than before.  Moving the large TV into his bedroom was not an option, so I purchased this from a local retailer.  The following notes are after a couple of days usage.Pros: this is a very compact unit and is not too heavy.  It fits on a hospital bed table (like this one: Hospital Overbed/Over Bed Top Table Computer Tray ).  This allows his caregivers to move the TV to easy viewing distance and is a real plus.  I was concerned that the unit would be unbalanced, but the weighted base is more stable than I originally imagined.  It seemed like it took a long time to find all the channels on his cable system during the initial setup, although I have not done this often enough with other TVs to judge.  Finally, the basic controls are on the left side of the unit, and the TV can be operated without the remote.Cons: The remote is not designed for use by an older person with declining eyesight.  The controls on the side have no contrasting labels, only labels molded into the black plastic, and unless you have good lighting, it is difficult to use them.  In my fathers case, the caregivers will probably be the only ones who can operate the TV.One additional point, which was a pro for my situation.  The plug is two-prong polarized, which works with my father's very old electrical wiring.  A three-prong plug would have been a problem for me.In our case, I placed the unit near the riser for the over bed table.  This left a lot of space for other things if needed.Recommended for anyone who wants a decent quality, small footprint TV.", "Date": "February 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Buy", "Author": "Hybrid83", "ReviewID": "R2CRRCZR75HDXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great price, great 19\" TV.

Since I don't have a lot of space the PC input is and added plus.-Picture quality - really amazing for such a small inexpensive TV. I don't have a cable box for this TV... just plugged it into the 'analog' RF cable that comes into my house. Once programmed the built-in cable tuner picked up 6 full HD channels as well as 80 or so analog std def. The analog 480i signals look ok, even in stretch mode. The full HD chanels (1080i and 720p) are extremely crisp and clear. My main concern was about pixialtion while watching sports. None of that at all. Smooth action all the way as if you were right there. LCDs really have come a long way.-PC connection - I initially used an analog VGA cable. I had to play with some settings in Windows 7 and adjust the TV a bit. The EDID information was not broadcast to my new Dell computer. Windows 7 only saw this as a generic PnP monitor so getting the correct resolution was a small challenge. (Needed to 'unhide' some resolution choices in hardware manager). Picture was perfect nonetheless. I then ordered an HDMI cable. Picture is the same quality but the computer actually recognizes this as a Sharp TV and now gives full list of resolutions. In addition you can also push your computer audio output through the TV if you want.-Minor complaints - The manual is not clear but it does give you 4 favorite channels on the remote. Cool feature but the manual is worded almost like you can have 4 per button or 16 of them. Not a big deal. - There is one audio output on here and it's just a 1/4in headphone jack. I plugged my computer speakers in the jack but there is a noticiable hiss at low volumes. Same goes for the headphones I tried. It's too bad b/c the audio that comes from the on board speakers is OK at best. Good enough though I suppose for a compact TV.Botton line - If you want a small HDTV with an awesome picture, buy this. Don't expect much from the speakers and use an HDMI cable if you intend to hookup to your PC. Keep in mind that there is only ONE HDMI input.**** TIP: Here's the link for the 6' HDMI cable I purchased -  very inexpensive w/ shipping and works perfectly****[...]", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little video gaming TV", "Author": "Etude", "ReviewID": "RK4Q291PWENWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This 19\" badboy is the perfect hi-def TV set for gamers on a budget.

While it's a little smaller than I expected (my fault, that's not reflected in the rating), I have two main concerns which knocked this back to 3 stars.First, vertical angle makes quite a difference on this TV. As you move higher it gets lighter--lower and it gets darker. I find I have to set it quite bright so that, while lying down, it's not too dark. Even sitting up you notice the difference. I expect no significant change in picture quality with any angle these days, and my [much older] Samsungs deliver that.Second, usability. The menus aren't the most efficient, and take more keystrokes than other systems.Additionally, auto-channel search takes forever (though that may be the way it works with the digital stations).Lastly, the volume range isn't that great... doesn't seem to get very loud.Unfortunately, this Sharp has fallen well short of the bar that Samsung set with my primary LCD (32\") and computer monitor (17\").

There is a little lag when you change channels but I was expecting this from reading other reviews pretaining to this TV.  It does not appear to be a problem.  The clarity of picture is good as well as the sound.  My grandkids enjoy sitting at the breakfast bar watching this TV.  We also plan on putting this Sharp TV in our travel trailer when we travel over a period of time.  It is compact and the portability will make it convenient to take along on vacation.  We are well pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.  I was a little apprehensive with having it shipped, but it arrived in great conditions and was extremely well packed.

I've had Sharp items before and thought I was getting a good product at a good price but was sorely disappointed.
