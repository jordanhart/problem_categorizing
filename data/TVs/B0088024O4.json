{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Vizio 55\" 3D Hi-Def Smart TV is a winner!", "Author": "Joseph Caruso \"USS Oklahoma City webmaster\"", "ReviewID": "R12AY70XS05WCG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had my doubts about buying this TV as I have been a fan of Samsung products since they were first introduced in the U.S. But I wanted a smart TV with all the features and the other name brands were priced too high. Vizio won by default but only after I read the reviews and considered the options very carefully.Most of the negatives that I saw reported by consumers were probably due to individual quirks by the purchasers. I have encountered none of the situations they complained about.This set has beautiful color, superb high definition and some very convenient and thoughtful features. I have yet to experience the 3D but that was a only a minor consideration and not one that I would often use anyway. The sound is good but I use a sound bar so for me this is also a minor consideration.I have had this set for about a month and it is everything I had hoped for and more. Amazon's price was better by more than $100 over the rest. Also, Amazon provided free delivery and in home unpacking and testing included in the price.The only thing I would like to have is a few more convenience inputs, perhaps on the front or side of the unit but again, that is a small consideration. These are usually found on sets at twice the price and more.On a scale of 1 -100 I would give it a 95. Frankly, I was surprised to find this much value in a TV manufactured in the U.S. Thanks Vizio - you made a believer out of me.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing value, Astonishing TV!", "Author": "RobzReviewz", "ReviewID": "R14YDIT8E2W5JS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me keep this simple - this TV is PHENOMENAL! It exceeds my expectations in every way!I really did my research before buying. Vizio is consistently rated as a 5 star product at a value price.Amazon came through with its usual flawless customer service. The TV was delivered on time, two workers assembled it and set it up.The picture is beautiful, drenched with richly saturated color. In 3D, the effects are nothing short of mind-boggling. The HiDef picture is so razor sharp, I actually couldn't believe my eyes! It's a different kind of viewing experience, so superior to film it almost takes a little getting used to. This is a new era in TV - and sets the bar at an entirely new level.Quibbling criticisms of the remote are exaggerated and unfounded. The pushbuttons are slightly spongey... push deep and it responds perfectly.My only real but minor criticism is that it does not automatically play 3D content in 3D - you have to \"tell\" it to play in 3D by a menu controller. Once you know where this is, it's very simple to operate. It may be there is an \"automatically play 3D content in 3D\" setting - I am still learning the vast range of customized options.In summary - I am THRILLED with this tv. I would be equally happy had I paid hundreds more. So this is a stunning value, and a breathtaking viewing experience.MY VERY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it - Love it", "Author": "Heather Smith", "ReviewID": "R23Z6AOFVYW623", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We LOVE this TV.

It is an excellent buy. The 3D is exceptionally good and you dont have to purchase expensive 3D glasses to view 3D movies, although, you will need a bluray 3D player and some very good 3D movies. It came with 4 pair of 3D glasses, plus i have a pair from a local movie theater that work just fine. The initial setup is easy. had no problem connecting to my wi-fi internet. It also has a standard Ethernet port for direct connect internet access. This unit produces an awesome picture that is extreemely clear and sharp. The audio is good, however, there are times that it seems that the audio is being compressed, so that the volume fades a little at times. But this is very minor. I am very pleased with this tv and would highly recommend it. Oh, yeah, it has severl available apps pre-installed (youtube, amazon.com, etc, plus you can add or delete as you desire). I bought it for the 3D features, and I am not dissapointed.\"", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV!", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "RULC29ZYHIMF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome TV.

The Internet apps are kind of nice feature if you want the television to access your network.  The picture has been outstanding and all of the colors are quite vivid.  We really enjoy the 3D effects that the television is able to display.  We have wall mounted it in the basement and my granddaughter tells us that she feels she is in a movie theater when she is watching it.

But the test was the actual picture. Well the picture was just awesome. The clarity blew me away. i loved the fact that the remote has an actual keyboard on the other side of it. it is very easy to set up and use. We currently have a sony, toshiba and insignia televisions all are HD. they are good but the picture quality is much better on the Vizio. I was also afraid of the whole 3D thing but oh my goodness watching the avengers in 3D in my home was mind blowing.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv great price", "Author": "Richard H Dougherty", "ReviewID": "R2S30O249MYDQ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very nice picture, easy to set up, great price point for a 55  inch smart tv  apps seem to work well  nice remote with full keyboard", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV", "Author": "Dishkid", "ReviewID": "RKV9KKE2WCOWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works perfect, great picture, 3D is awesome, but I don't use 3D very much.

First, my cable company's DVR only has regular 3 wire connectors, and is connected to the TV in this manner.  But the TV only has jacks for one device to be connected in this way, and my Wi doesn't have HDMI capability, so I cannot connect it to this set.  My Blu-Ray 3D DVD player connects fine with the HDMI cable, though.  Second, the sound on this set is very mediocre.  Luckily, I have an old sound system I was able to connect to it.  Third, the remote is about half the size it should be for easy use, especially for a person up in years and/or with large fingers.  It is not lighted, either.  I have 3 other flat screen TVs, 27\", 32\", and 42\".  None are expensive sets, but all have better sound, and easier to use remotes.But for the money paid, I am satisfied with this set.
