Murphy \"No Bling\"", "ReviewID": "R2YKZ7HKZBTFWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the years, I've done reviews and have studied prior to purchasing. I did no different on this LG 60PZ550. I looked at nearly all brands of PLASMA TVs and finally fell into the LG realm. My first thought was to get the biggest/best, then I started looking at the actual numbers. What was my criteria?1) Screen Size: 60\" ... but, it had to be no more than 34\" in height.2) 3D:  this isn't really my criteria, I inherited it from my kids.3) Thickness:  I don't want a very thick or heavy TV4) Plasma:  Sorry, I've owned and viewed LED/LCDs v. Plasma - for sheer 1080p experience, my perception is that Plasma always looks better.So, going through the brands, I found only LG to fit my criteria. The most important was #1, if it doesn't fit where I need it to fit, all the bells/whistles won't matter. I could give a hoot about 3D, but my kids insisted for their experience. We went to the big box stores and I will admit, it does look cool. I do not have the glasses yet, they are on their way (As the first reviewer mentioned, the 250's are for this TV). Thickness, holy smokes, who wants those behemoths we had a few years ago. This is thin and fairly lightweight. Beautifully done. OK, then finally, the Plasma v. LED/LCD debate. It will go on/on/on.. it's a matter of perception. Technically, the Plasmas have the edge; however, LED/LCDs are catching up. My personal perception is that Plasmas look MUCH better than LED/LCD. Your mileage may vary.If you do the great comparison that Amazon has towards the bottom of the product page, you'll see this TV is stacked up against the big 2 - PZ950 and PZ750 - whats missing from the 550? THX (yea right); TruBlack Filter (err, not sure what that is); SmartTV (more apps on the TV I'll never use because my 3D Bluray player has them); Magic Motion Remote (great, another remote that I have to point \"just right\" to do the menus ... plus, I already have a remote that turns it on and off) ... hmm ... not really seeing why I would pay a premium for those features. All else is equal.So, yes, would I recommend? **ABSOLUTELY** What don't I like about it? Nothing, I love it; however, something that might irritate people is the very reflective surface. It's like a mirror; however, properly positioned (I have a tilt mount), it eliminates my the irritant factor. I've had it with lights on and off and it's beautiful. Really, I am not using this TV to it's true potential with all the stuff on it. I don't use sound (it's connected to an HDMI receiver), I don't tune with it (U-Verse customer), I have 2 cables going to it:  power and HDMI (high speed recommended ... or ... incorrectly labeled HDMI 1.4a). I don't even use the internet portion. I use it as a HUGE monitor for all the stuff I do (U-Verse, Wii, PS3, Bluray) ... and now 3D.UPDATE 13APR2011 - This TV most certainly has ARC (Audio Return Channel). \"Definition: Audio Return Channel (ARC) ia a very practical feature that has been introduced in HDMI ver1.4. What this function allows, if both a home theater receiver and a TV have HDMI ver1.4 and offer this feature, is that you can transfer audio from the TV back to a home theater receiver and listen to your TV's audio through your home theater audio system instead of the TV's speakers without having to connect a second cable between the TV and home theater system.\"The 60PZ550 is certainly doing this function through my receiver. I made the assumption that since I did not connect my internet to it, I wouldn't need it. I connected my TV to the internet today to see what the functions were ... typical ... Netflix, Hula, Youtube... etc. I fired up a Netflix movie (which looked pretty decent) and low and behold, I have BEAUTIFUL sound coming out of my receiver.  Please DISREGARD the reviewer who stated there was NO ARC.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible Picture!!", "Author": "Daniel R.

I felt the picture on my Sony was too dark...especially for playing video games on the PS3 and/or Xbox 360.  I researched via google and read that a plasma TV is better for a darker environment.  After hooking up the TV to the wall mount and turning it on, I was shocked at remarkable picture improvement between the plasma and my previous LCD.  I feel this TV is WELL worth the money, considering it came with 2 free pair of AGS250 (current 2011 model) 3D glasses.  A couple of notes:  make sure you turn the contrast down to 60 or less, since the factory settings have it at 100.  If you leave it at the default setting, you'll have a problem with burn-in.  I have mine set at 60/65 (contrast/brightness).  You'll notice burn-in either way if you watch a lot of sporting events as I do (IE - any programming that has a non-moving bar along the bottom...like the current score of a game), but it's easy to get rid off by either tuning in a channel with white noise or using the TV's built-in ISM (Image Sticking Minimization) \"white wash\" feature to eliminate it.

The picture *is* generally good.  The problem is with the quality of the panel itself.  I've had 2 of these, and within 20 hours of use both units had pixels start to die.  The pixels weren't dead out of the box, things were fine for the first few days, then they just started to die off on both units.  And these big televisions are a colossal hassle to repack and return, and that's if dead pixels are even covered at all (LG doesn't cover them).  You get what you pay for, I suppose.  Next time I'm waiting an extra 6 months for a higher end model with better panel components.  $800+ down the drain.EDIT:  An LG technician came out to my residence to diagnose the problem, and apparently having *6* dead pixels and 3 spots of residual dirt *underneath* the screen is \"a completely normal part of the manufacturing process and should not affect my enjoyment of the set.\"  I will never be purchasing another product from LG.  Frankly they make me sick.EDIT 2:  It's now been another month, and I now have a white stuck pixel in addition to the aforementioned defects.  LG still won't cover it.  What a disgrace.

The Panny developed a defective section of pixels and needed to go.Anyhow, I love the aesthetics of the LG; the thin bezel is just fantastic. It is also 50% lighter than the \"smaller\" TV it replaced. It is a bit more glossy/reflective compared to the old Panny but I have excellent light control with some motorized blackout shades at the rear of the room. Picture quality is on par if not slightly better than the Panasonic it replaced. Note: The main viewing position is 13-ft from the screen.My system includes:  * Onkyo TX-NR905 Reciever (HDMI 1.3 4-in, 1-out)  * Onkyo DV-BD606 Blu-ray Player  * Playstation 3  * Xbox 360  * Comcast DVR (Motorola DCX3400)With the old Panasonic hooked up, the above components all worked together in perfect harmony. 4 HDMI cables into the receiver, one HDMI cable out to the TV. Clean and simple.With the new LG hooked up, the following occurred:  * Comcast playback and Onkyo Blu-ray playback are flawless. Both run though the receiver with no issues.  * Xbox 360 playback, well, didn't work. Something about the HDMI handshake running through the receiver resulted in no video playback. I tried various HDMI settings on both the Xbox and the receiver with no luck. I had to resort to Component/Optical for the Xbox to work correctly.  * PS3 played fine through the receiver but it wouldn't playback in 3D. No surprises here. The PS3 was unable to detect my TV as 3D compatible running through my \"now obsolete\" receiver. I needed to run a dedicated HDMI cable to the TV and revert to Optical for Audio in order for it to work.I have two pair of AG-S250 3D glasses. They look great, aren't too heavy and seem to have great battery life.However, the biggest problems with the glasses are:  1. They emit a buzzing sound. VERY annoying.  2. One pair of glasses continues to lose sync while the other doesn't.The quality of 3D playback isn't great in games like Killzone 3 Demo on the PS3. I get a lot of ghosting. Playback of 3D movies (watched Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs last night) is better but you can still notice double images in the foreground every once and a while. If anyone has some tips to remedy I would love the feedback.The Picture Wizard was handy out of the box to get the basics set up. I'll be using my DVE Blu-ray to calibrate/tweak the TV settings further later this week.That's it for now.

Thomason \"Movie Family\"", "ReviewID": "R2TGNNW8228I22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only reason we have been going to the movies at all lately is the 3-D.  We do not enjoy the cost, or the loud people with their cell phones bothering us.  When my husband's back injury got so bad that we are really not able to go to the movies at all, it became time to upgrade.  We bought this setalong with a new LG Blu-Ray player and 3D glasses and we got it all set up, it was very fast and easy, and headed down to get a couple of 3D movies.Now, I am a big fan of the 3D quality of movies, but I do not need the effects to come out and poke me in the face.  I also enjoy the depth that comes from a good 3D effect.  This TV delivered on both, while watching Alice in Wonderland and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.  There was a little ghosting in Alice, but it was not too much more than I saw when I watched it in the theatre, and very little if any ghosting in Cloudy.The glasses (this TV takes the new ones, I believe it is the 250) were easy to work with, lightweight and effective.  They did lose sync a few times each movie.I liked the many HDMI inputs and the USB ports.  The TV has wireless capability, but you DO need to buy the dongle (and isn't that a weird word.)We moved up from a Panasonic 50 inch plasma bought about 5 years ago which has a grey frame.  The slim black frame on this TV was a DRAMATIC improvement.We have the TV in a room with a LOT of light, and I was concerned because I heard that they are like a mirror, and there is definitely some reflection issues, but honestly, not much more than my old Panasonic.  We were still able to watch a 3D movie in full light and not miss much of anything.So, I have only had the set up for a couple of days, but I LOVE IT!!!", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome for the price", "Author": "Cash", "ReviewID": "R3DFUNP4000IJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I also just bought this tv locally from Frys for $799 with 2 pair of glasses. I have also noticed the same issue with the glasses turning off about every 10 minutes. Very annoying when playing a game online (Killzone 3). Hopefully theres a way to change that. It also seems that the 3D is a little slow to render and looks a little fuzzy but thats probably just the game. Havent tried alot of other 3D media yet.When 3D is turned on there is a note that comes up that says it is best to sit 2 meters away from the TV for the best viewing. So plan on sitting relatively close to the tv when using 3D.The 2D to 3D is an awesome feature. Didnt even know it was an option until I hooked it up. Watched a movie for about 2 min and it was pretty cool.Hooked up my laptop with a VGA cord and played some video on it smoothly. I have a couple short stereoscopic cartoons that I played from the laptop and worked great. Not sure if its a standard feature or not but you can watch regular 3D media such as 3D blurays, side-by-side stereoscopic or top-and-bottom stereoscopic, and of course the 2d to 3d. Its a really awesome tv.Another thing that kind of bothers me is that there is no headphone output for audio. Small annoyance though.I really didnt research a lot about different capabilities and statistics of 3D TVs I just saw a great price and got it and have no regrets so far.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "just my opinion, so far a bit of a disapointment", "Author": "mindluge \"mental inhabitant\"", "ReviewID": "R9JR0MADK6USX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i'd give it 3.5 stars if i could.  i got this tv and a pair of 3D glasses because i was anxious to get into 3D and have a Fuji 3D camera.  the 3D part is pretty good.  it's not like an Imax, but it's good 3D for now.  my real complaints are with the glossiness of the screen.  my wife wanted me to return the tv because of this.  if you have any light in the room you will see yourself in the darker parts of the screen all the time (it serves as a room mirror when the tv is turned off).  also, after adjusting the tv's settings and going through the built-in wizard and using a calibration disc, i just can't get the image to seem as good as the Olevia LCD hdtv that this is replacing.  i was expecting this plasma to be an improvement; i know this isn't a high-end plasma, but it is in the same price range or more than the Olevia it is meant to replace.  also, it is frustrating to have to be so mindful of the potential for burn-in.  we watch a lot of old movies and unfortunately there are lines where the black bars from the 4:3 image was on the screen.  you can use a solid screen of white or color-cycling for fairly brief periods of time to wash away the burn-in effects.  i like the inputs the tv has, 4 hdmi ports are nice; it's also thinner which is nice.  I would say this is a good tv, but wish it didn't have the caveats.  if you plug in a network cable or get the wireless dongle you can can connect directly to Netflix and a couple of other services which is pretty nice, although i prefer the interface/resolution i get with my PS3.  also, you can plug a USB flash drive directly into the tv which is pretty nice for slideshows etc.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "What a great deal of a television", "Author": "GS", "ReviewID": "R3I98BKWLX3MXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I just want to say WOW.  The picture after you tweak it using the wizard and a little fine tuning is amazing.  It is a very clean image with great color and contrast.  Really one of the finest images available in the price range.  I scored this with 2 pairs of the ag-s250 glasses for 1389 so really a great deal.  As for the 3d itself as I'm sure many are interested; the depth provided by the television is spectacular.  It isn't quite so much images coming out of the screen (it happens a bit), as it is creating the illusion of space inside the set itself exceptionally well.  I've noticed minimal ghosting so far, don't know if it is due to the media, television, glasses or a combination.  Another feature I enjoy is the 2d to 3d conversion, it works fairly well, especially with computer animation or magnified high definition such as nature documentaries.  I would not put the 2d conversion up with true 3d media but it does portray some illusion of depth you wouldn't have without it.  Overall I am very impressed with this television, plasma has come quite a long way even in the last 5 years.  I would highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price, but not without a few minor setbacks.", "Author": "Mike Dunk", "ReviewID": "R3B3VYE92H66IJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV back in August of 2011. I bought it to replace my Sony Bravia 52XBR9 LCD that was starting to get panel failure. So far I have been pleased with the TV and especially the price I paid in comparison to the size of the TV. There have definitely been some trade-offs with changing from an LCD to a Plasma, but nothing too major.PictureThis TV is definitely a lot darker than my Sony LCD, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I use the TV for video games and I would prefer a bit brighter of a screen, but movies look fantastic with the darker picture. The picture is comparable to the Sony (I played Scott Pilgrim Vs The World on Blu-ray with both TV's side by side), but definitely not as crisp (I know I'm comparing a top of the line Sony to a middle end LG). Overall, the picture is great and I love having a 60\". The extra 8\" makes a world of difference to me.There are two Cons with this TV for me. The first is image retention. There is noticeable image retention after having something on the screen for a short while. As mentioned earlier, I play video games on this TV and I can usually see the HUD retained on the screen when the screen goes black. Watching videos with black bars on the screen will also cause image retention. This is minor because the image washes away when something new and bright comes on the screen. I am a bit paranoid now with leaving the screen on. I find that I turn the TV off anytime I pause a game because I'm worried I'll get burn in. Maybe this is just a result of me switching from an LCD and not knowing how much is too much with image retention on a Plasma. Like I said, all the image retention has gone away after something new is on the screen and there is even a screen wiping option in the menu to get rid of the images.The second Con is the reflective screen. This is a minor problem for me. The screen is a big sheet of glass and will reflect light. I have one window opposite of the TV about 10 feet away. The window reflects off the TV, but it really doesn't bother me that much. I watch movies at night and it isn't a problem unless a light is on. Be warned that a lot of windows or lights will affect your viewing.SoundI use a separate sound system so I can't really rate this. Who buys a 60\" TV without hooking it up to a sound system?A minor Con with the sound on the TV is the size of the Volume Graphic that pops up on the screen when you change the Volume Level. It is a circle that takes up a foot square in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. It is way to obtrusive if you ask me. I would have preferred a smaller horizontal bar across the bottom of the screen. Just a minor preference for a feature I never use (because of my external sound system).FeaturesThe 3D is cool, but I haven't used it too extensively. I downloaded some free 3D videos from the PlayStation Store and watched them. 3D seems to be a hit or a miss depending on the video you watch. It is more of a video source problem rather than any defect in LG's 3D TV or Glasses. Some 3D videos do it better than others. 3D games are pretty cool, but nothing I would do for long periods of time.The menu system is simple to follow. The TV supports DLNA and browsing files off of my server is easy to do.The online features aren't as robust as Sony's, with only 4 or 5 apps to use. I really haven't played around with them that much to give a good opinion. I use my PS3 for Netflix instead of the TV.ConclusionI am very happy with this Plasma TV. You can't beat the size to cost ratio that you get with Plasma. I purchased this TV in a bundle on Amazon with two free 3D glasses and was excited to get such a big TV for relatively cheap. I am also happy that LG has a 1 year warranty on the TV and a 2 year warranty on the panel. I know from personal experience that Sony only offers 1 year total and that really screwed me with their XBR9 that started failing 1 month after warranty.

Seidman \"Jim\"", "ReviewID": "RTALEWFTN06HF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I know my 3-star review is harsh. This TV has a good picture, and the \"Netcast\" applications are pretty good. We're heavy Netflix streaming users, and the built-in Netflix app is quite usable. YouTube is also usable, although the user interface is completely different from the Netflix application.However, I have to knock off a couple of stars for a truly terrible design choice. Like most higher-end TVs, this one implements the HDMI-CEC standard (under the brand name \"Simplink\") to let you control other components with your TV remote. For example, it's supposed to be able to automatically turn on your home theater receiver when you turn on your TV, and control the receiver volume with your TV remote control.Sure enough, in the TV's Simplink menu I can switch it to use my Home Theater for audio, and the LG duly turns off its internal speakers and routes audio over the HDMI cable. When I turn off the TV, it automatically turns off my receiver. But, when I turn the TV back on, it reverts to internal speakers - I have to manually turn on my receiver, and then do the Simplink setup all over again!I spoke to LG, and the the rep acknowledged that this is all by design. After all, some people might not want to have things turning on automatically when they turn on their TV. (Yeah, in which case they could not use Simplink, or turn off the CEC feature in their receiver.) As far as I can tell, ever other brand other than LG implements this correctly. Even the rep I spoke admitted that he wished it were implemented differently.If you are already planning to buy a universal remote and don't care about HDMI-CEC at all, and don't plan to use the TV's internal tuner and use HDMI's ARC function to get sound back to your receiver (which depends on the same Simplink setup), then this is actually a very good TV. But for the great many people who will be hooking this to a receiver and wanting to use CEC features to simplify life, LG has deliberately ruined their product.Update on 6/18/11: I no longer think that my 3-star review is harsh. I have the TV directly hooked up to a coax cable input. When I first got the TV, I could tune a digital TV channel by keying in the channel number, e.g. 205. Then LG put out a firmware update (which it's impossible to decline or reverse) that makes it so that you have to tune digital TV channels by first pressing the actual RF channel (like you would know) followed by the published channel number, e.g. 77-205. Of course, this thoroughly broke the numbers I programmed into my Harmony remote control. And it makes it nearly impossible to find a rarely-used channel, as there's no way to predict the RF channel that'll go with a particular cable channel. I spoke to LG tech support, and they freely acknowledged that the factory put out a firmware update that had this effect. Tech support has no idea *why* they would do that, and sympathizes that it's annoying, but can't do anything other than forward on a complaint.In short, LG not only deliberately cripples functionality, but they can (and do) choose to wreck additional functionality after you get the TV!", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Bang For Your Buck", "Author": "E. Dixon", "ReviewID": "R3EO4Q9SSJ6BUJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV for $800 during a sale, so the price factors into the review based on other TVs at that price range. I could have probably gotten a better TV for hundreds more, but that isn't a factor.Also, I am coming from a 42\" LCD. This too has a lot to do with my review.Picture: Coming from an LCD, I was not initially used to the plasma screen. LCD is much brighter and after using it for years I was a little surprised as the brightness (or lack thereof) on the plasma screen. After some changes to my basement, however (a single blackout curtain and moving one lamp) the screen appeared much brighter without all the light around it and it was no longer really an issue. I am still getting used to some slight glare of light on it from the window during the day, but my friends don't notice it and it is most likely just because I am extremely picky about things like that. As for the picture quality itself, I think it looks much better than the LCD I had and I am astounded by how much better HD content looks on it than my precious TV. It delivers a very beautiful picture.Inputs: I mounted the TV on the wall, which made it kind of a pain to hook component and digital audio cables into the back, but there are HDMI and RCA inputs on the side which met my needs there. There are also two USB slots on the side. I've had no issues with HDMI compatibility with anything I've plugged into it (PS3, Xbox 360, HTPC, Onkyo receiver).3D: I don't really care about 3D, and the inclusion of it on this device was basically just an added option for me. I don't plan on using it at all, so I can't really comment on it.Image Retention: I've no had any troubles with it, even in my first couple of weeks of use. I might see a faint hint of the black bars from 4:3 content when switching, but it goes away near immediately. I use an HTPC which means lots of static windows and backgrounds and it hasn't been a concern. After 4 years of use, my old LCD had bad image retention issues, so I hope this one does better.SmartTV: There is a suite of \"apps\" for this TV, including Youtube and Netflix, but I don't have an ethernet connection in my basement and I am not going to pay for a branded wireless dongle just to use it. My HTPC and PS3 stream all this stuff just fine so I have no need for it.Overall: I kind of bought this TV on a whim, which I normally don't do (the $800 sale price and a windfall of some extra cash pushed me) but I am very pleased with the purchase. The only problems I have with it stem mainly from my move from LCD to Plasma, and I think they will cease to be problems once I settle in with this TV. There are lots of added options (3D, SmartTV) for people that might make a difference, but I am basically just reviewing the picture quality and compatibility with my other devices. On that front, it has worked flawlessly and I have nothing bad to say about it at all.

He finally chose this model and I have to say he chose right. Once you use the picture wizard to setup the picture and watch a movie like Avatar, your jaw will drop. It's amazing to get this good of a picture for the price. The 3D is really icing on the cake. Don't go off the display picture you see in stores, most stores don't even use an HD signal to display their TVs, and if they do the signal has been bleed out horribly. Plus you really need to set the picture up with the picture wizard to get it dialed in right. The only advise I would give is to wall mount the display. It's too big to place on a floor base stand. On the wall it looks just right. Cnet stated in a video review that these TVs had bad black levels, and i have to say if they do my eyes must not be good enough to see it and I do have 20/20 vision.

The sound is better then some, but if I am watching a movie it is going through my surrond system anyways so the sound for everyday watching is fine. The internet apps. are little weak, you also have to purchase the wireless adapter seperate to hook up wireless. This can fixed whenLG write the new firmware for the TV. There are also some games on the TV that are pretty lame. I would much rather play an Xbox game. The picture was awesome during the baseball game I watched last night. For the price I paid I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for an upgrade. Besure and order from One Call.

In the end the features the 750 provided didn't justify the cost for me.  The magic remote feature sounded kind of cool, but I really like using my Logitech universal remote & I didn't want to have to rely on the TV remote to perform basic functions.  Really the only feature the PZ750 had (that I liked) was the THX certified 3D mode, however when I read deeper into it I found out the THX certified mode, was simply a Preset.  So theoretically you could reproduce that mode by toying with brightness, etc in the 3D settings.In the end I am extremely happy with my purchase and the $ I saved going with this model.  It's hard for me to imagine a TV getting any more clear or vibrant than this TV, especially in 3D mode.  I'm sure if you did a side by side comparison to some other super high end TV's you might be able to see a difference, but for me this TV is perfect.I don't see how you can do better on a 60\" 1080P 3D TV, with 2 pairs of active 3D glasses for $1,150 shipped.  BTW, I got mine from Paul's TV and couldn't have been happier with the shipment.  They put it down in my basement for me and hooked it all up to make sure everything was working to my satisfaction.Also, FYI I have not even tested the speaker on this TV as I have it hooked up through my receiver which uses other speakers, so I cannot comment on them.  My only complaint thus far would be every time you put it from 2D into 3D mode you get two warning messages that eventually go away, or you can press enter.

Package had two shock detectors, a nice touch, with neither activated. No stuck pixels at startup, nor any in the week since.My experience with the picture is the same as most reviewers'; an excellent picture, with the lack of definition of the deepest blacks not noticeable. Reflection does occur, but is not severe.  Daytime brightness (in a room with indirect sun) is no problem at all; halogen ceiling lamp was easily avoided with slight screen tilt; the day/night tracking works well in this environment.A pleasant surprise was the movement smoothness or fluidity that was easily seen in football and auto racing programs. (The previous television was a Sony Wega CRT 1080i/780p.)The remote was fine for setup, which was easy; the set was close to my taste, except hue which moved 8 points.  That may change with break-in.  The included picture adjustment aides worked well. The Directv remote was programmed with the LG code, with the DTV-suggested first try being the correct code, so I do not use the LG remote now. It is a nice remote.I bought this set instead of a another brand of similar specs and similarly good reviews because reviews mentioned that the LG's sound was okay (for a thin TV set), which is to say quite a bit better than most thin panel sets; and it is good enough to save my having to purchase a soundbar or AV receiver.Perhaps the most pleasant surprise is finding that the autovolume control really really works!

So i embarked on my first Plasma television purchase and i am not disappointed. Going from 720p and 1080i to full HD 1080p is quite noticeably an improvement.This TV is everything LG claims it is, the picture quality via cable, PS3 and Xbox is amazing and the 3D (I've only watched Resident Evil: Afterlife so far) is breathtaking. Watching objects float in front of your eyes and seeing things flying out of the TV while watching 3D is a sight to behold. What everyone says about the mirror screen is true. My TV room is dark so it's no problem for me but if your room is well lit with uncovered windows you are going to have reflection problems.There are plenty of options in the menu and many that i haven't even discovered yet I'm sure but the remote is very nice and intuitive.Even more amazing than this TV itself is the price, can't say i've found a better deal on a 3D tv this size and i even got a deal that included 2 free pairs of AG-S250 glasses which you'll need to watch 3D on this set.Which leaves me to the only con here. The AG-S250 glasses lose sync regularly and you'll have hit the sync button on the glasses to resync. It only takes a second but it's still irritating. Every review of the glasses list the same problem so i know it's the glasses not the TV that is the problem. Hopefully LG will address this sometime soon.

I have one floor lamp that is positioned in a corner of my living room across from the TV, and I can usually see the reflection of it when I'm watching TV.

Amazon's price was $600 less than the local big box store, plus free shipping.Two things:1. A previous reviewer made an error in stating that this television does not have audio out.  In fact it does.  It has a TOSLINK fiber optic output, which is better than the standard RCA plug output.  So if you want to listen to Netflix on your home theater audio system, your A/V receiver must have a fiber optic input.  Most modern receivers costing over $300 or so do, but check first.2. Delivery:  Pilot was pretty good.  They never called me once, but I called them everyday after I saw online that the television was at a depot about an hour from my house.  They told me that they were going to give it to a local company for final delivery, and that the local company would bring it in my house, carry it into the basement, and set the television on my television cabinet.  Well the local guys never called but I called them and they showed up right on time.  However, they said they were only allowed to bring the set in the front door and no further.  $25 later, they agreed to carry it to the basement.  It was simple to unpack and assemble the stand by myself.  However, it was not so simple to pick up the television by myself and lift it onto the stand.

In fact I originally purchased LG's 47\" LED TV and didn't like it very much.  If you google problems with their TruMotion feature and complaints about higher refresh rates (240hz) you'll see that many people find that watching movies/TV shows on those TVs ruins the experience - what should look like professional cinematography ends up looking like something an amateur shot with a handycam.  I heard buying a TV with a low refresh rate of 60 hz (which is less and less common) or buying a plasma solves this problem.I was originally very concerned about buying a plasma due to rumors of burn-in.  In fact I hadn't even considered it. But after doing extensive research online and consulting with LG, I was led to believe that this was a thing of the past.  That current safeguards ensured this would not happen as long as certain proper behavior was used. I did everything I was told, I never watched TV for many hours straight, I never left my DVDs on pause (but instead would turn off the TV and resume it later), used screen savers whenever possible, etc. So you can imagine my shock shocked to see very noticeable burn in on the sides of the TV. We watch some older 4:3 dvds and some older TV shows on Netflix. Both have black bars that run along the sides of the TV screen. These left very noticeable burn-in.  I don't understand it since by far the majority of our shows do not show these black bars and the TV has never been on for more than maybe 3 consecutive hours at most.  I've only owned this TV for 4 months and do not watch TV every day but when we do,  we probably watch from 1 hour to at most 5 hours per day (not consecutively).  Perhaps it is unfair to say \"very noticeable\" since I admittedly had not noticed it before today - and that was only because I couldn't find my remote and was using the buttons directly on the TV.  Standing right in from of the Tv,  I saw it clear as day. And now that I did notice it, I always see it, even from my couch, and it REALLY bothers me.  UPDATE - LG TOLD BE THE BURN-IN WAS NOT PERMANENT AND THEY WERE RIGHT.  THEY ALSO TOLD ME HOW TO RUN A SPECIAL BUILT-IN PROGRAM TO REPAIR THE BURN-IN IF IT DIDN'T GO AWAY ON ITS OWN.  BUT IT DID GO AWAY AS SOON AS I STARTED WATCHED A NEW PRORAM THAT FILLED UP THE ENTIRE SCREEN.  SO THIS IS NO LONGER A MAJOR ISSUE.Also, there is one dead pixel which is annoying but I only notice it when the screen is all one color.Other than that the TV is great and I'm really happy with it.  Netflix sometimes has trouble connecting on the first try which is a bit annoying, and I get a lot of glare (normal for plasmas) but I'm glad I bought this TV.Update 1.5 years later - still love the TV but it exploded 3 weeks before my warranty expired.  There was a loud zap and aand smoke started coming out the back!!  My home has pretty old electrical and I think the problem was the outlet, not the TV.  Even so LG sent a repairman who fixed it without any problems.  I hadn't thought to check the 3D though until aboud 3 weeks AFTER my warranty expired.  When I did, it turned out the 3d emitter and burned out as well. I called them and after a brief back and forth, they agreed to send the repairman back to fix that and they did.

Amazon had it shipped in my area within a few days but the 3rd party shipper, Pilot, took about a week to finally deliver it. They came on a Monday and I refused the shipping because the packaging was horrible. Maybe the box was too weak. The TV was sticking out the box and was scratched by the truck. Amazon had a new TV to my doorstep by Wednesday, packaged correctly. I am really proud of Amazon for this.As far as the TV itself. I was actually disappointed initially. I used it to replace a 42in panasonic viera plasma in the front room. The panasonic consistently had a better picture. But after a week of the LG TV, I am satisfied. My eyes have adjusted to appreciate LG's picture and I think the picture is still pretty good. I guess for the size and price, you can't really expect the best. You won't be disappointed unless you have truly seen a great picture. I have it on the Sports mode and enjoyed a great weekend of college football so far. The close ups on (faces, clothes, jerseys) are really great. But when showing the whole field from a distance the picture doesn't really measure up to the best HDTVs out there. I use Dish Network. I chose LG because I have 32in LCD and was really satisfied. Overall, LG has the best bang for the buck so if you're really picky for superb HD you will have to pay much more (maybe twice as much).

I wanted 3D, so it was tough finding something decent in this price range.  I replaced a Panasonic 60\" LCD Projection HDTV.Overall, the TV picture is good, bright, and the operation is good.  I guess I'm satisfied enough not to return it.  If I had to do it again, I'd probably not go with this one.  Here are my complaints:No Audio Return Channel (ARC).  I guess this is my fault, because the only place I found the specs on whether it had it or not was other web sites where it listed it as a feature, so I assumed it had it.  It does not.  I couldn't find the specs on the LG website or the manual.  Even contacting LG it took them forever to find whether it had it or not.  So, if you are unfamiliar with ARC, it's the ability to send sound back over the HDMI cable to your home theater receiver.  Not being able to do this, makes Netcast sort of useless because you receive your audio/video from the web directly to the TV (ethernet), so you need to get your audio to your receiver.  You need to now use the Optical out, which is another cable from your TV to your receiver.  I was going for the single HDMI cable to the TV--can't do it with this TV.And Netcast is sort of disappointing too.  For one thing, what they show you on their website it false.  For example, they no longer have Yahoo Widgets on their 2011 models.  I'm not sure where it says that on their site, but their flash presentation shows that as part of the Netcast content.  It's misleading.And the only other thing is the HIGHLY reflective screen.  It is almost like a mirror.  I was used to our matte finish older TV, so this takes getting used to.  The good thing is the picture is very bright, so most of the time it is not an issue, but if you are at all distracted by it, plan on watching TV in the dark. Oh, and I have it mounted on the wall so I could tip it to reduce the reflection/glare, but you just can't tip a 60\" TV enough to get rid of all the reflection/glare.So, the two stars include the lack of good information, specifications, misleading website, and lousy (and uniformed) customer service.

Doesn't have this bright picture like LED TVs, and shows real tones of black. Very warm picture! It really is great value for money, especially considering how decent it looks.It comes with Internet capability but I have never used it, as my LG BluRay player is a Smart player and gives me all the fun things I need.Only problem I see is that there are no native screensavers:  all built-in apps (this also applies for the BD player's) just show a constant screen and I fear a burn-in at some point. My solution is that just turn off the screen without having to turn off the whole TV. Just means that as soon as I even just change the volume, the screen comes on again and I need to turn it off once more.Overall, I would highly recommend this product for anybody looking for a nice-looking Plasma that is very affordable and offers solid picture and sound quality.Something I forgot to mention, that is in fact reducing the review from 5 to 4 stars: the display is so incredibly glossy, I need to completely close my blinds in my otherwise well-lit apartment.

To summarize my experience with the PZ550 thus far- I purchased this model on Amazon approx 10 months ago.  Immediately when I received it, it was defective.  There was a thin black line that extended vertically on the screen all the way from the top to the bottom.  I immediately called Adorama and they were very courteous and sent a repair person within about 3 days.  That in itself though was distressing because I had a brand new defective TV and instead of getting a new replacement, the repair guy swapped out the entire guts of the TV.  Fine, ok, so be it, the TV worked beautifully.  All of the features and the picture were optimal, including the 3D, especially after calibrating.  Bluray and PS3 looked stunning, as did most HD programming.  All in all for $850, the TV lived up to my expectations.  But then recently (approx 9 months after purchase), that mystical line on the screen appeared again, this time horizontally right thru the middle, extending from the left side of the screen all the way to the right side.  I put up with it for approx 10 days, and was going to call LG for a possible replacement unit when magically the line disappeared.  I was good for about 2 weeks and now suddenly last night that line appeared in the same place again.  So I decided I had enough I was going to call LG tonight for a replacement. Lo and behold I get home from work turn on the TV and bam, TV goes blank.  I have sound but no picture at all.  I called LG and expressed to them my anger that this is the 2nd time in 10 months that I had same issue.  Fortunately it's under warranty but they told me they will not replace the unit until it's been repaired at least twice.  So I had to take a day off work next week to get repairman out to my house again.  Obviously I am very upset about having a major repair performed on what it supposed to be a high quality TV.  It's very frustrating because when it works optimally, it is beautiful, I really do enjoy the picture and the features.  I do hope this is an anomaly and that I simply have just had \"bad luck\" with this particular unit.  If it was out of warranty and I had to pay for this 2nd repair, I would be furious.  I am concerned though going forward that I am going to continue have issues, I hope those concerns are not warranted.  I did a lot of research on various brands/models in this price range before making this purchase.  LG in general as well this particular model seemed to have fairly solid reviews so the fact that I have had these major issues seems to be somewhat unusual.  I'll report back in the future and update whether or not I have any more issues.***As a quick follow up*** The LG repair finally made it to my house today (after 2 weeks of waiting because he had to order the part). He replaced the entire \"guts\" which is essentially the entire TV sans the screen and plastic casing. Again this is the 2nd time this has been replaced in 10 months I have owned the TV, thank goodness warranty covered both repairs. It is such an inconvenience though...this TV is wall mounted so I had to have my clunky old 32\" HD on a stand in the middle of my living room for two weeks. Not to mention I had to take two days off work to meet with the repair guy (once for a \"diagnosis\" and today to have repair actually completed). Plus I have to recalibrate and break it in for about 100 hours. Too much of a headache for me. I will be upgrading to a 60-70\" in about another year, I am seriously leaning towards a Panny LED, my previous 720 Panny Plasma was a gem, I'm willing to pay a couple hundred extra for the quality. The saving grace with my PZ550 is that the picture quality is excellent on BluRay and PS3 along with sports viewing which I do a lot of.Update 11.17.12  I decided to increase the rating from 3 stars up to 5 stars.  The reason for this is because now that my TV was repaired under warranty for hopefully the last time, the picture is awesome.

LOLI purchased thie Plasma TV in July of 2011.  I watched an entire season of football (American) both College and NFL with this beast.  The colors on this TV are almost beyond reality.  Out of the box you MUST calibrate the TV as you won't know what the heck is going on.  The controls are simple and accessible. This model includes two isf expert profiles that can be adjusted, as well as at least 5 presets.  WARNING - this is a very powerful plasma! Plasma's EAT energy when on MAXIMUM capacity.  I recommend using the APC profile for general tv watching as the power consumption will be 1/2 as when this TV is not using it.  APC was ON by default and figuring it was useless I changed to another mode and disabled APC through the \"energy saving\" button.  BIG MISTAKE! I almost doubled my power consumption in the one month I didn't use the APC setting.The 3d works fine, probably as good as higher end 3d.  Yes I've seen some ghosting with 3d on this model but seriously who cares?  Who watches a ton of 3d movies at home?  I went to friends to watch super Sony 3d that was supposed to be flawless and saw some ghosting on his tv too.  I personally being 3d is still a gimmick as I don't use it.  Motion in this TV is crazy, like 600mhz which adds to the very lifelike color and visuals.Overall I am very satisfied. If you can get your hands on this model, it's a bargain.  Finally, yes the TV is very reflective; you'll hate this TV in a brightly lit room. Find a place for this TV where there is reduced glare. Then again there isn't any protective coating to dull the color-it's a trade. You want something fantastic? Buy a TV for $3,000 or $4,000.

After doing a significant amount of research and shopping around I couldn't find a TV that matched the features, size, and price combination of this one.  I picked up the 60\" model and suggest going for the size if possible.  After reading the reviews I was a bit wary, but decided to go for it.  After having this TV for a while I can confirm that the positives and some of the negatives written in these reviews are accurate.I didn't think the glare issue would be a problem for me and for the most part it isn't.  When watching after a while my eyes adjust and I'm into what I'm watching.  But if you have this in an open space where there is a lot going on behind you then you may want to be aware if that kind of thing bothers you steer clear.  I have this TV in a room I'm building in my home and it will eventually be closed off, but as of now it isn't.  When there is a lot of activity going on in the background, at times this TV can act as a mirror in the dark areas of the screen, to the point I can see everything going on behind me.  When it is off you can use the thing as a mirror, the screen is that reflective.That being said, I love the TV and don't regret the purchase at all.  With what I intend to use it for it meets all my expectations.  The 3D is decent from what I've tested on it.  I haven't had anything blow me away, but it gives the desired effect.  The picture shows beautifully.  I have no complaints with the picture quality at all.  Everyone who has seen it has been impressed.  The size stands out immediately and it shows really crisp images.  The frame size isn't bigger than it needs to be and isn't cumbersome or distracting.  The energy saving features are a plus.  I forgot it on one day after being preoccupied by a call and returned hours later to find that it was off.Note; I did not utilize the internet apps for this TV because I have devices connected to it that does those things better, so I can't speak to the quality of that.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Money well spent!!!", "Author": "Moe Rivera", "ReviewID": "R1HF3DQVLQK294", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have two LCD's and they are no match with my new 60\" Plasma, the picture is amazing.

I tested the TV using 2 different 3D-DVD players and glasses, so I am confident that the problem wasn't the result of defective equipment.  Additionally, while Blu-Ray DVDs looked amazing, everything else was a massive disappointment.  SD DVDs and channels had a highly washed-out, grainy quality.  Brightness across the screen was uneven, and detail wasn't as sharp as expected.  Adjusting the settings helped, but the picture quality was still poor enough to be a constant distraction.On the plus side, the sound was unusually strong for a flatscreen and the viewing angle was far superior to most sets.  I ultimately sent this set back for a Panasonic Viera TC-P50s30, which offers a much better picture.  The other reviews leads me to believe that I simply received a defective set, so I can't be too hard on the set.  But ultimately, I'd go with the Panasonic.

Saw this great deal on Amazon and ordered it.  First, it didn't come on the scheduled date but I got over that.  I had to call the freight company 3 times before I got the TV.... not Amazon or LG's fault.  When our installer put it up and turned it on I could not believe the massive glare.  I would have sent it right back if it wasn't for the wait to get it, the trouble with the freight company and paying an installer to mount it and hook it up to our network. Instead I thought I would send LG and email and ask them if there were any suggestions or products to reduce the glare.  Instead I got a reply back that made me pretty mad... and I quote from LG customer service \"Bright or direct light sources can definitely cause a glare on the surface of the television. The screen for this model work best in low level lighting\".  Really, thanks LG for your now obvious comment.  If you would of put that in your marketing literature I would have chosen a different TV but those statements don't sell TV's so they tell me after the time and money I have into it. Now, after that email back from customer service I am a little taken back and mad.  So, I email back and let them know that I am disappointed with their response and would appreciate their expert advice on what I can do to reduce the glare.  I told them I have seen screens that you can put in front of the TV or sprays that you can use on the current screen to reduce glare.  I would like this advice because I don't want to waste my money or ruin my new LG 3D TV. Well, a month and a half later I still don't have a response from them.  So, with that said... just know that this TV screen is a very shinny \"glass like\" screen that reflects like a mirror.  In fact everyone in the office calls it \"The Black Mirror\".  We have an office full of flat screen TV's and this TV is the only one that does this.  I am disappointed in the TV and more disappointed in the company LG.
