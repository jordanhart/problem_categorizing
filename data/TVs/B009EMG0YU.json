When on RCAs website for repair, gave all information on contact email, when I tried to submit form, it kept showing me that my email address was required- THE ONE THAT WAS CLEARLY IN THE BOX! Tried retyping and even other email addresses I have, it finally just kicked me out all together. While I'm fighting that, my wife is reading bad reviews on this tv. I give up, sending back to amazon to get my money back.

The DVD player didn't work at all. Went through the tech support suggestions and nothing worked. Many reviews on other sites said this was a common problem. Looks like it's a common problem with the combo sets in general. If I add up the time I took away from work to receive the item at home (which UPS screwed up anyway by a whole 24hrs.), and all the time problem solving I could have purchase a much more expensive rig from the start. Tomorrow I'm going to go out and buy a dvd player and tv that are separate from each other because I'm running out of time and this was supposed to be a surprise gift for my wife's sewing room.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful just a Wonderful TV.", "Author": "sleepersteve", "ReviewID": "R22FCMGBRQC56W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV and I was worring about how it would work. Yes I read the reviews and even the ones that said the DVD player did not work at all  right from the start, well I READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, just for the heck of it and guess what? You have to put the DVD in like backwards, lable on DVD pointing away from you, or shiny side toward you. And guess what it worked perfectly the very first time and also a great picture to both for the DVD and TV. Yes this little TV is a great buy I knew I could trust RCA. I also used the mount made buy Ready-set-mount model # cc-R22B it works very well and was easy to instal. the TV has all the settings that a larger TV would for everything from tint to closed caption and a lot of other settings so you can really set this TV up to the way you want it. I instaled it above my computer monitor so I can watch all my oldie DVD's and TV. the remote has every button on it also that the large TV's do. Yes I think RCA went all out on making this little but big TV. The color is great and it 's very easy to set all the ajustments. I am sure glad that I decided To buy RCA and not go with the other more costly ones. One thing do not push in the DVD let the DVD player take it in slowly and you will have no problems. This TV is great for the kitchen, den, office, or small bedroom and the sound is not all that bad either. I guess I've said all I can about this little GEM!! Enjoy your TV/DVD player I am enjoying mine. I have had this TV now for a couple of months and it works just great the DVD is also working with out any problems at all I have to say this is a great TV and very inexpensive I use it in my office and it is on all day every day like I said make sure you put the DVD in BACKWARDS or it will not work remember BACKWARDS!!", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "D.

As far back as I can remember as a child in the 60's, RCA products have been in our families' homes and we have always been quite pleased with the quality and performance that is synonymous with RCA. Perhaps this is a minor manufacturing technical issue that needs to be addressed and remedied as soon as possible. On the other hand, the picture quality is spot on, in spite of the DVD dilemma. At this point, I am debating on whether I should take a chance and trade this unit in for another unit, keep it the way that it is because of the relatively affordable price, or simply request a refund; I haven't made up my mind yet.
