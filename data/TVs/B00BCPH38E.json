Clark", "ReviewID": "R2SPH7I8JRKZVW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the new \"budget\" plasma model from Samsung that was released early 2013. It basically replaces the 2012 model E530. I beleive my Best Buy started stocking this model in mid-February.Pros- 25% reduction in power usage over previous E530 series. Now 144 kWh ($16 per year) vs 193 kWh last year ($21 per year)- The Viewing Angle is perfect from side to side- Super Rich Blacks- Amazing vibrant color- More options in the menu system for customizations- No motion blur like LCD/LED 60hz- Best price for the size and quality- Smaller bezel trim than E530 (only 1 inch)- Extremly thin, you might mistake it for an LED- 1 USB input port for quickly showing off videos/music/photos on a usb driveCons- I can see reflections if I do not have lighting setup correctly and the brightness very low.- Small amount of buzzing very close to the screen, though silent from about 3-5 feet away. (This is normal)- Limited HDMI ports (2), however, I use an HDMI switch: Portta PET0301S 3x1 HDMI Switcher Support 3D- Not a smart TV, however, I own a WD TV Live Streaming Media Player Wi-Fi 1080p that updates the firmware much more frequently than SmartTVs and an XBOX 360.- No 3d (but I don't want it... I wear glasses not contacts)General Notes- Plasmas are best where you can create a somewhat dim environment. LCD/LED for lots of ambient light.- Burn-in is not a problem in modern plasmasRich BlacksTraditionally the deep black colors are the best reason to get a Plasma over and LCD/LED. To truly appreciate the black levels you will need to control the lighting in your room. In a bright room, you will see reflections on the blacks. This is because Plasmas have glass screens. With that being said, the new F series of this panel seem to have improved over the E series. Blacks seem to be completely void of any \"grey\" color. It is truly amazing and cannot be appreciated in bright show rooms.CALIBRATIONMovieColors are much more lifelike and real. Skin is a bit too dark and yellow and a bit dull. Whites have an off-white color and somewhat green tint. Contrast and blacks are still deep and impressive. Tweaks: Turn down the sharpness a bit, less than half. It should help with graininess. Under picture, change the Color Tone from Warm2 to Warm1, this will make a huge difference to offset the off-white color. You can play with some of the other \"Enhancements\" under picture to alter the color and picture to your liking.StandardThe default mode. Looks a bit artificial and looks a little grainy. Color does not feel lifelike or natural. Using the standard settings without altering the settings, you will not get the best performance this panel has to offer. I think the default Color Tone in this mode is Cool2. Changing this to Cool1 will remove the pale blue tint. I have also increased the brightness in this mode because it felt a little too dark and dull.DynamicThis is the setting stores will use to display this model. Everything is bright and loud. It will appeal for some people, especially very short term. However, I think it does not give any type of realism. Colors are too bright and exaggerated. In this setting, I have left everything in the default mode. I typically will use this setting if I want to have the shades pulled back and I'm letting lots of light into the room. This should help counter some of the reflections.Picture SettingsWith true HD sources, you can use the \"Fit Screen\" setting instead of the default \"16:9\", this should help improve a little graininess and overscan as well.The F5300 is truly a winner at this price. Colors are bright and vibrant, while the blacks are deep and true. At this price, the whites are going to be a little greyish and the blacks aren't going to be as deep as the more expensive models. You can't really expect the quality to match the more expensive Samsung models. With the proper calibrations, this TV will still shine and can look extremely natural and true.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "If you're obsessed with PICTURE QUALITY, look no further", "Author": "Hawkzilla", "ReviewID": "R33WDELRCS5HAO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just a quick background on myself as a consumer perspective... I am a 41 year old man that has been a graphic design artist for for over 17 years. I have a love for movies and an obsession for color accuracy and picture clarity. I started the HD experience 8 years ago with a 50 inch 720p Sony LCD, which didn't last and needed expensive bulb replacements. I switched to plasma after researching which format provides the best color accuracy. I've owned two 50 inch 720p Panasonic Vieras (plasma) for 4 years now and have no complaints. Plasmas are known for the screen glare, but if you are serious about picture quality you will not have a problem pulling the curtains at times during the day... and you will be blown away when watching TV at night.So recently I decided I wanted to finally upgrade to full 1080p and bump up to the 60 inch range. I took a chance on a 55 inch Vizio \"smart\" TV, which was a LED and many reviews boast about the impressive brightness and non-glare of the TV. It was $1500 and I had it for a week before sending it back. First, most of the \"smart\" features were clunky and I had them on my xbox or bluray player anyway. Second, I could not get past the horrible look of skin tones on the LED. No matter how I calibrated it, the skin looked washed out and without detail. I get brightness is important to some, but for myself if I'm going to spend the money I want picture first, with everything a very distant second.So I waited patiently and searched for a 60 inch plasma that got consistent high marks for picture quality. Eventually I came across this Samsung 5300. The reviews were a lot of \"great picture, not much else\"... which is perfect for me because I wanted to pay for picture and not extra stuff that I wouldn't use anyway. I got this bad boy home and gently set it up and was simply blown away. First power up the picture is already impressive, though once you play with the many settings this unit offers you can get it to the point where your mouth with hang open as you experience HD the way it was meant to be. I simply cannot say enough about how impressed I am with the picture of this TV. Color is spot on and whites are impressively accurate even at higher contrasts (you will notice LED TVs tend to lose white details as they get \"blown out\"). The sound that some complain about is understandable, until you realize this TV has a equalizer setting. Once you find the EQ, which is put in a rather stupid setting so it's kind of hard to find, you can get the TV to sound 10x better than with default settings. There is really nothing else to this TV, just killer picture and good sound with all the settings that usually only TVs over $2000 provide. Basically you can tweak this TV to be exactly what you want to see and hear, which is very nice.To address the \"glare\" issue... I get glare from my Panasonic plasmas as well and you get used to it. It's not as bad as some make it out to be, usually only bad enough to be annoying when it's super sunny and the sun is coming in just right. Otherwise the screen is bright enough and the picture is nice enough that it won't take you long to never notice the glare. If you have OCD and feel you will obsess about the glare then I would stick with a LED, but if you are a picture quality freak like myself the glare sacrifice is well worth what you get for picture excellence. Oh, and I have heard no \"buzz\" like some have mentioned. Not sure if I'm just getting old or maybe I don't sit 2 feet from the unit, but my TV is quiet. I have also played xbox on this and noticed zero lag, so no gaming issues for me (other than it annoys the wife).PROS:- Unbelievable picture quality for under a grand- High enough refresh rate to handle the opening title of Big bang Theory with no pixelation (nice)- Professional level settings usually only offered in high end units (both visual and audio)- Audio optical out for best quality audio signal and surround sound- Sleek looking design and sturdy feeling build- Color accuracy is life like- Fast power on- Cable TV is awesome, but bluray will melt your brain. MELT. YOUR. BRAIN.- Price. I still can't believe this TV was $600 cheaper than the Vizio LED I tried.- TV rotates on the standing mount. Very nice feature.- Plasma has a ridiculous half life (where you notice loss of quality) and no bulbs or maintenance requiredCONS- Some settings can take some digging to find- I'll never understand why companies have the default settings so dull. Adjust your picture and sound asap.- Remote can be confusing for the average electronic user- Only two HDMI outputs- Day viewing isn't as impressive as night, but still much better than LED or LCD in my opinion- Glare takes a little getting used to at first I would highly recommend this TV for anyone who demands picture quality and doesn't need apps or a TV that can do your taxes.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "A 5 star with one quem:", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R23C62XAHQUQZ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first plasma TV.

Most modern dvd blu ray players (save for some of the LGs (Example: LG BD300 and LG BD590) are not able to zoom to fill up the entire screen. This tv doesnt have the option to fill up the entire screen on any of these three options, meaning no matter what you are left with black bars of some type for Blu Ray content even if its a small amount. Those aspect ratios are common with most plasma or LED tvs. But it would be nice to have a zoom or zoom 2 option to avoid any temporary image retention. Maybe samsung will incorporate this onto their tvs in the future... In hte meantime, I have purcahsed an LG blu ray player with the zoom feature allowing me to view all my movies and content without any bars.Negative #2  Buzzing:  PLasma tvs are known to buzz but some are louder than others.  On this one its noticable especially if nothing is playing and your looking at it directly on from a close distance or in a smaller room.  Off to the side, not so much. wallmounted, not so much.  volume on and wall mounted, not at all save for really quite parts of the movie.  But buzzing is there.  If your coming from LED to plasma, dont let this alarm you. Its a normal part of the technology and samsung even addresses this as normal operation....I would gladly take the slight buzzing heard when there is no or little volume for what you get in exchange, namely: Image quality. Its amazing. the best ive seen on a tv...even from my former LED samsung. Blacks are black, image is crisp and clean. Vivid colors, excellent volume on the tv itself. Good assortment of options...Pixel shifting is left on and is a nice feature.  Just a great overall tv.

I was a bit concerned about the reported screen glare, but once I received the TV, it wasn't as bad as some have indicated, even in normally lit rooms.  Granted, care does need to be taken when placing lamps and other sources of light in close proximity, as I have noticed that reflections are visible when the color black is displayed on the screen.There are only 2 HDMI ports on this set, which is a bit of a let down, but I read that this could be remedied via an HDMI switcher, or simply by unplugging devices that are not in use.  The picture settings offered are standard fare, but really, what more does one need?.  Pop in a THX calibration disk or use their iOS app and the picture on this set will really show you what it is capable of.  The lack of Wi-Fi did not deter me, as I simply use an Apple TV and PS3 to stream and watch HD content.The design of the television is very attractive and feels very sturdy.  Being a plasma, there is a bit of heat generation near the rear of the set and it also produces a slight buzzing sound, which are all within normal operation parameters.  The sound is only noticeable when standing within a foot or two and is not an issue.Overall, I highly recommend this set and for the price, you simply cannot beat the size of the display and the quality of the picture.

I owed a Sony projection television before I bought this one and it didn't reflect anything.  So I was stunned when I sat in front of this television and saw myself and the back wall.  And when the television is on the blacks projected on the screen reflects the wall and whatever is back there.  I was so concerned that I was going to send the television back.  But that would have been the biggest mistake of my life.  Here is what you probably want to know; this television's picture is absolutely awesome.  The colors jump from the screen and dance in front of your eyeballs, like a ballerina in an opera,  I had to hold my breath as I watched \"The Thing\" (the pre-sequel  to Kurt Russell's) in Blue-Ray.  I play PS 3 games on this beautiful creature and I can't believe the colors of Madden or Tiger Woods or Basketball or on anything else I put in the machine.  This television is one of the best that I have ever had and I had a few good ones, for a poor boy.

On ANYTHING.  But in this instance I feel compelled.  A little background for the readers... I was the previous owner of a 2011 Panasonic 55 inch VT30 (plasma) which was their top of the line picture.  That TV was awesome.  Super rich blacks, great color and sharpness, zero motion blur... Just an incredible picture... Until it suffered a catastrophic failure which required  replacement.  To say the least, I was depressed and didn't want to spend good money on another high end set.Not wanting to spend an arm and leg to replace my higher end set, I decided to go for a budget tv and skip the 3D and smart tv functions (I have a ps4 for streaming net flicks and never use the 3d)  First up, I chose a 60 inch Samsung LED.  I had previously been a plasma guy and was curious about LED sets so I went for what looked to be an ok tv.  Disappointment doesn't begin to describe my impression of LED sets.  Blacks were dull, and even worse light was bleeding through anything dark leaving blotchy \"clouds\" of light on any dark scene.  It was horrible during dark scenes. Popped a Blu ray in and it was unwatchable because the backlight was bleeding through the corners so much.  Very distracting.  I played with all the settings for over a week trying to live with the problem... and I corrected it at the expense of having a dull image.  In the end it was just too flawed.After a week I returned it for a 60 inch Samsung plasma model #PN60F5300BFXZA.  It was a hundred bucks less than the LED and I really wasn't expecting much.  Man was I wrong.... This set was AWESOME.  DEEP blacks... Almost as good as my top end panasonic (almost).  Great natural color, very sharp, zero motion blur. I couldn't be happier for $899.99.  Right out of the box it was obvious and noticeably better than the LED. After calibrating it was 10X the picture of the LED.  Really it's only a slight step down from my old plasma picture quality wise.

If you're the type of person who notices and is bothered by this kind of thing I'd suggest going for another plasma.I bought this as an upgrade from an older plasma and while I still believe it is the best plasma in its price range, it has one problem: brightness pop. Their D series had it and they fixed it with a firmware update, so I figured that was the last we'd see of it. Guess not. When playing a game or watching a movie, if there's a lot of of bright on the screen, it flickers. It's only noticeable when there's movement, but since this is tv we're talking about that's kind of all the time. This is the second one of these I've purchased and it's present on both.

The only tweaks I did were to turn on the WHITE BALANCE and turn the GAMMA to +1. The picture is smooth and glasslike with deep blacks, luminous colors, and natural skin tones.I find the brightness of the plasma screen to be just right in my room. I personally do not like the garish brightness of some LCDs and LEDs. It looks great with both HI DEF Cable and BLU RAY. I use HDMIs to connect both.

Let me address some things and my reasoning behind my perfect review.1) Many people complain about glare when owning a plasma set. My thing is, if you place anything with a reflective surface in a path of light, won't there always be some sort of reflection? This is common sense to me. If you are placing a television in a room that gets a lot of light you need to be wary of it's location. With that being said, I find this TV to be no more or less of a hassle than any other in terms of glare.2) I put little faith in the picture I see in stores. They are often pulled right out of the box and placed on the wall with no care for settings. I adjusted the TV to my liking. Saturation, brightness, and sharpness are mainly where I concentrated and while the picture was great when we got it home, it was fantastic once we set it to our liking. It is very clear and bright. We have a blu-ray and an xbox 360 hooked up to it and WOW! Streaming movies look wonderful on Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Instant Video. Video games are crisp!3) I am really excited about the sound this thing produces.It isn't just loud, its crisp/clear sounding, and I love the bass when I listen to music, watch movies and games. The only thing I change is the mode, Standard, Music, Movie, etc. based on what I'm doing.4) I love the base of the TV; while this may seem trivial, it is unique, a welcomed change from the traditional flat base of every other TV. The shiny, slim design of it looks great on my entertainment center. And everyone thats seen is in awe of its size. If you are looking to go big, this is the TV you want.I don't have any cons thus far.

Harris", "ReviewID": "RD1FMUN71HBD8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After my 6 year old Panasonic plasma TV died I started looking around for an affordable replacement.  The Samsung 51 Plasma eventually emerged from the pile of great displays I was looking at primarily because of the price.  This set is devoid of the extra bells and whistles that are starting to show up on TV's and the price reflects that.  As it is a plasma, it is heavier than LCD-LEDs but vastly lighter than my 6 year old plasma.  The screen is quite reflective (as some reviewers have mentioned) but it is not at all distracting to me.  Unless you are in direct sunlight I don't imagine it should really be a factor.  The display is very nice, par for the course with Plasmas.  Dark blacks and free of ghosting.  It isn't as bright as LCD-LEDs but the overall image quality accounts for it.The set itself looks pretty sharp.  About an inch of border around the display isn't obnoxious.  The stand is fine and the TV sits atop without any noticeable lean to the rear which a reviewer had commented on before.  There are only 2 HDMI ports but I have a receiver with plenty so the point is moot.  The HDMI inputs are kind of oddly placed near the side of the TV so if you have a stiff HDMI cable part of it might actually jut out from the side as it makes its way to whatever component it is plugged into.  With a little convincing I was able to get mine to drop more abruptly and the cable is hidden.  Not a big deal but still an odd design choice.I ended up buying this set through BestBuy.com for $600 pre tax.  Amazon was more expensive for some reason.  Gasp!  Overall very happy with it.

I access wi-fi and smart functions through my blu ray player (Sony S5100), and audio via AV receiver.

The picture was unacceptably inferior to plasma. The panny I wanted was no longer available so I went with this one and I'm glad I did (where this TV is located has very exact size requirements)This is one of several flat-screens & projectors in the home and while not the biggest, it has the best picture by far.

So I cannot go into to too much detail and may update later.  I just replaced a 2004 1080i Sony plasma with this television.  It was a 50 inch and weighed easily over 100 lbs.  It was also 3/4 inches smaller in display then this TV but with framing that was six inches wide up and down plus side speakers and framing that were an extra 9 inches or so actually seemed bigger then this TV.  The Sony also came with a seperate tuner/receiver box (or it wouldn't work) and one HDI (the large old school version of HDMI) input.  It was a hand-me-down that cost $5,000 new but I was content with it.  So this Samsung being made THIS YEAR is 9 years younger.I like this television for many reasons.  It can be carried by one person. It is really thin compared to the 4 inch deep flat screen I was using.  OK enough about my old TV, anyway, this TV really brought me in to the 20 teens.  I do not need a smart TV.  I don't need an LCD because my room is dark and about 12 x 20.  So with the couch being on the shorter side of the room this is more then big enough.  I did a lot of researching and there is a controversy with Samsung televisions.  They have been busted putting their brand name on televisions with Sharp panels and even worse panels from some cheap China company.  I really wanted a Samsung though.  I read that they have decided over the years to specialize in monitors and have made the screens in Sony TV's and Surgical and other industrial monitors because of their high quality.  All the smartest people I know have a Samsung (including a brilliant military IT contractor who swears by them).Then of course I read consumer reports and guess what brand is always at the top of the ratings?  Samsung.  So I had my heart set on this brand of television.  I was sad to find out that they had been contracting out their panels and didn't want to get stuck with a non-Samsung panel.  There are videophiles who will go through the boxes to make sure they get the right model that shows that it's a true Samsung.  Anyway, I chatted online with a Samsung rep before buying this tv.  She assured me that all the panels of this model are solid Samsung.  So knowing that and knowing that I didn't need a smart TV (because I have an Xbox & a PS3) or 3D this Television met my specs.Most people don't need a smart TV because they have a set top box or game system to make their TV smart.  So don't buy more of what you don't need.  As stated before if your TV isn't in a High sunshine room then you can also be fine with a plasma.So I've plugged this in and used up my HDMI slots with my two gaming systems and have been watching for a couple of hours.  So far so good.  The reason this TV doesn't get five stars isn't due to the picture or lack of 3D & Smart TV apps.  I knew exactly what I was buying.  The reason this TV is subtracted a star is because of only having TWO HDMI ports!!!If your going to make a basic television that's doesn't have a bunch of special built in apps and items don't you think it would be smart to at least give you more then TWO HDMI ports?!!?  It's funny they give the televisions that are smart TV's more then one that isn't.  Does that make sense to you?Concerning the picture: It looks like a top of the line 1080p plasma television. I don't think you could get much more out of a current plasma television no matter how much you spent.  I won't compare this TV to the other formats because that is apples and oranges.  People are so hyped up about LED's and LCD's that they forgot that plasma is a great format.  The blacks are black and the colors are vivid.  Also, check out how much TV you get for the price!  I don't pay tax in my state using Amazon so I saved myself seventy dollars in tax as well.  In addition, this television was made in FEB 2013! You can't get much newer.  If your looking for a great picture at a great price with the overall best brand name in televisions you cannot go wrong with this set.  If I had a bigger room I'd have gotten the bigger version of this set.  I use a small indoor antenna and I get nearly 40 channels living on the northwest boarder of the city of Chicago.  The digital tuner is AWESOME!  I basically get twice the television stations with a television in the same spot.  They made a great \"dumb\" TV that you can turn into an awesome TV with your own AUX items.  Your paying for the picture and sound.  That's it.  The integrated speakers are OK BTW.  I plan on putting my own speakers on this television very soon but the speakers on the television are serviceable just not great.The only TWO HDMI ports just drives me insane.  I'm sure I'll want to put more items in the future but I guess I'll have to get a box for that.  It just doesn't make any sense.  This TV should be loaded with ports for being the type of TV it is which is not much more then an awesome monitor.It's pretty much exactly what I wanted other then that though.  It looks great and as long as you understand what your getting you'll be happy.  You cannot go wrong with this set.  Buy this for what it is and you will be extremely happy for the price..****EDIT 8/31/13 FYI there is NO direct audio out.  Sure there is the S audio out for my speakers (which I think it needs because the internal speakers are flat sounding) but there is no RCA audio out for my wireless headphones.

Christ", "ReviewID": "R2UDDD8R8Y6TZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Havent had this TV that long, but so far my family and I are LOVING it. We had the 60\" Samsung Smart TV with all the bells and whistles, and although it was really nice, unless you really use all the smart features, you really don't need them not to mention that if you like to listen to movies with loud volumes, the every annoying voice guide will pop up at least twice a night when you don't want it to. The brightness was better on the more expensive Samsung 60\" but if it's in a really bright room, you're going to have trouble with any plasma. My son smashed the glass on the expensive one and fearing he may do it again, I opted for the cheaper one this time; but much to my surprise, I wish I had bought this one in the first place...I have read all the 1, 2 & 3 Star reviews and I do have to say that I partially agree with some of the reviews in a couple of areas;SOUND - if you mess around with the settings you can get somewhat acceptable results, but IMO, spending another 200 bucks on a soundbar would be VERY WISE. And with the great price on this unit, that is not a big deal to me. It was annoying that there was no audio jack, so I did have to spend an extra $20 bucks on an optical audio cable or whatever they are called, but I was able to get the sound bar to work just fine. And although you do have to use 2 remotes, I had to with the expensive plasma as well.PICTURE- To be honest, I really didn't notice too much difference between the top of the line samsung plasma vs this one other than the brightness was better and overall it was a bit sharper, but not too noticeably-had I known the cheaper plasma picture quality was this good, I never would have bought the 3k one!?. I did experience the glare/brightness issue, but we just got different curtains which were darker and problem was easily solved. Even with the $2,700 Samsung Plasma, when the room was bright the glare/brightness was an issue. I'd rather change the shades and enjoy the plasma rather than get an LED/LCD and have the sun in the room and have to watch the annoying drag of non-plasma, LOLI did not notice any flickering OR buzzing either behind the tv or from the screen as some of the other reviews indicate. I even stuck my head behind the tv and it's pretty much silent behind there and the picture is pretty much crystal clear- really can't complain at all. PS3 games had no lag/fuzziness, blue-ray looked as expected, HD tv was definitely great, I really can't complain.DESIGN - Compared to the top of the line Samsung, I really didn't mind the slight extra bulk. It's really not that much bigger at all. I actually kind of prefer the black plastic to the metal on the more expensive one b/c when they ding, it's really noticeable and ugly from almost every angle.My one gripe is the hideous stand. I understand most ppl are gunna wanna hang this thing on the wall and it would be a non-issue to them, BUT I have a nice 60\" TV stand and it BARELY fits on the stand; there is MAYBE half an inch between the ends of the legs and the ledges of the front and back of the stand. This isn't really an issue for me because we keep the kids away from the livingroom now, but in the event that one of the legs was brushed off the stand, i'd be really worried that the whole thing would crash and smash all over the place.OVERALL, if you don't need all the smart features, save yourself the $2000 and get this one for $850.

I had a handful of goals: larger screen size in the 50\" range, better picture quality and inexpensive!  This Samsung hits all those high points and more.  Over the course of several months of research, I was focused on a Panasonic Viera S60 and this Samsung plasma since I'm mostly a movie and sports person.  Plasma works well for both of these programming types as long as you can control the lighting.  My biggest concern was reflectivity from plasmas but I took the plunge anyhow.  When Panasonic discontinued its plasma line, prices shot up which left me with the Samsung.  But no regrets here, the Samsung has performed admirably.From a physical design standpoint it's basic but decent.  Spider leg stand, thin 1\" bezel and a fairly thin form factor.  The pre-sets for the screen aren't great but it shouldn't take too long to tune it based upon your eye and information on the net.  Once you get it tuned in, blacks are quite inky and the picture pops out with strong color saturation for a nearly 3-D type effect.  Built-in sound is decent but a bit flat, good enough.  You'll mostly likely hook it up to a home-theater AV system so no big deal there.  The remote is ok but be aware there aren't any TV controls on the front.  You've got the Samsung joy-stick in back and the remote which is why the remote design is sorta important.  And thankfully, it's adequate. Given it's a plasma, there's also more heat coming off of this TV compared to an LCD/LED panel.And the reflectivity?  It's definitely there but not bad at all. The major issue is dark scenes/movies in a well-lit situation.  Otherwise this Samsung plasma has enough brightness in lighter scenes to control reflection issues.  Also over time, I do think your eyes tend to filter out the reflections.  So yeah, this budget Samsung plasma TV works well for me.  Without a need for Smart apps (and I think it's silly if you prioritize them with your TV choice), it provides a great picture, solid design at a REALLY low price.  So while from a performance standpoint I'll give the F5300 four stars, once you factor in price it's a five star offering!

I've owned it a couple of weeks and the TV is working great. love it. Biggest con is that multi-function power switch and the remote that comes with the tv. I have no idea what Samsung was thinking with a single button for function control. Sometimes I just want to push a button to turn it off as I leave the room. I really prefer the separate power, volume, channel and menu buttons. The remote feels cheap compared to the remote that Samsung shipped with my blue ray player from a couple of years back. Minor stuff really. The image is incredible when the lights are dim or off. Rooms with windows(even with blinds) or with lots of light you can't control should stay away if you will watch mostly in the day time. I got it for a bedroom tv so 95% of the time I watch at night time so not much of an issue for me. totally worth what I paid for it which was the lowest price of the year. No hum/buzz sounds. It just works. I got a Roku 3 to make it smart...Roku 3 is better than Samsung Smart TV, faster and more responsive. I own the top of the line Samsung PN59D8000 from 2011 and I see a Roku coming for that TV in the future. I strongly suggest not considering Smart capability when buying a TV anymore. Roku 3 is as responsive as an Ipad. Also the stand is very sturdy. I've installed it before and it is just as sturdy as the one on my 59\" tv, same style. Take your time and assemble it on the edge of a bed with nothing on it. Get help whenever you move it from the box to the bed and from the bed to the final location.

The remote control has decent button sizes, but they are quite cramped and not completely clear. You'll have to adjust to that. You also want to adjust the picture to \"Dynamic\" (Menu, Picture, Picture Mode), an upgrade from \"Standard.\"The great picture comes partly from a highly-reflective screen that could be a problem during daylight in a room that is very open to the outside sunlit world. I experienced an unwatchable screen before I closed the blinds. After the sun passed midday, it wasn't a problem.The great picture wasn't great until I changed the Picture Mode to \"Dynamic.\" I found I had to do this on the HDMI input then do it AGAIN on the cable TV input. Without that change to the TV input, the picture was darker than some Rembrandts, and not so artistic.There is an e-Manual built into the TV, which seemed like it might be silly, but I have already used it and like it. There is an index to help find the instructions you need after failing in the limited paper documentation provided. The e-Manual allowed me to learn about the PIN number setting that is used to control access to some functions.You can't expect much from speakers that are, typical of virtually all current LED/LCD and Plasma TVs, embedded behind the screen rather than facing out into the room.

I never expected that level of sophistication.You get what you pay for when it comes to connectivity, which is limited. I appreciate the USB input for viewing personal content.

The 50\" LED model looked a lot brighter next to the 60\" plasma in the store, but I knew from reading reviews online it looks much better at home.I ended up buying this PN60F5300 60\" model and I'm very happy with it. I put it on 'Movie' mode in the TV settings and turned off some of the auto correcting filters, and the picture looks just spectacular. The colors are deep, vibrant. The picture is deep, sharp, and clear. I think this looks better then LED/LCD TVs. I'm very surprised by the sound considering it was the lower end model.

I have a Roku hooked up to it with a couple of premium services and can't stop watching it.Some cons:-Only 2 HDMI ports.-When the screen has a solid white or mostly white picture, it dims a little to slight reddish hue - I'll see this sometime in a frame where everything is covered in snow, or at the end of a car commercial where its just text on a white background.-Picture looks a little dark and bland out of the box. Needs a little tweaking to look great. Just switching it to Movie mode in the picture settings is the easiest way to make everything look much better. I knew from reading reviews of plasmas this might be the case.Overall I had to give it 4.9 stars because even for the cons, I get a 2013 60\" Samsung plasma TV that looks absolutely spectacular for $850, and I couldn't be happier with it.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Stefan Casperson", "ReviewID": "RFR9BDPW8YYRP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Incredible Picture but few bells and whistles.

No Smart TV bull crap, component out, great colors, over 240hrz refresh rate, 1080p, big screen. This tv goes above and beyond.For starters this tv is a Plasma, so you can not match the color richness and palette of this tv. While Palsmas are being fazed out because of their high cost, they will be missed dearly. LED is nice but you can't even argue or compare it to a plasma. Another bonus for me is that the screen is glass. This means easy cleaning, dust doesn't stick, and smudges actually come out instead of smudging more. However this comes with a trade off. That being glare. Glass reflects, it's comely known, but if you can cut off windows and light sources from the tv, glass in my opinion is still the best.This tv is not a smart tv. This is not a problem for anyone because smart TV's are expensive and you can get all that they have to offer and more, and a better experience by getting a set top box, also you will save about 200-300 bucks. Blu ray movies look unbelievable on this tv and with the TV's 600 refresh rate (which is the highest they come) action movies are unbelievable.I also played some games on this tv from my ps4. The second I plugged in my ps4 and looked at the main menu, I was instantly blown away by the colors being displayed. Then when I popped In a couple games, my jaw literally dropped. Safe to say that my experience with this tv is amazing.Another great feature is the rotating stand! It can't do 180 degrees but it does enough.On the downside of things the tv only has 2 HDMI ports and the inputs can be labeled, but not custom labels and just things like \"tv, game, blu ray, cable\" etc. no \"ps4, Xbox\" anything like that. Also the picture settings that come default aren't good at all and I recommend highly that you mess around with the settings to your liking or go to cnet for the best setup for this tv.With plasma's not being produced much longer and smart TV's dominating everywhere this might be the last tv of this kind you will get.

They are:Reflections:The high-gloss finish is VERY reflective, and you will see your living room superimposed on whatever you are watching if there is even the tinyest amount of light. If you're watching sports or a sitcom, you will probably not mind. But if you're watching anything with a lot of black scenes like Game of Thrones or Batman, it's pretty bad. I find the TV basically useless during the day for anything where I care about the picture quality. At night I have to turn out *every* light in the downstairs to make it acceptable. If you buy this TV be prepared to buy blackout curtains or else only watch at night.Buzz:There is a faint buzz that is audible in a narrow column directly in front of the TV. It's not audible from a few feet to either side, but if the TV is facing you head on, you can hear the buzz from 15-20 feet away. It has annoyed me to have to angle the TV just so to avoid buzzing at the people sitting on the couch.Flicker:When the TV is displaying a perfectly still image, like a photograph, you can perceive the screen refreshing.

And this 2014 Samsung plasma has BETTER COLOR than the 2013 lower-end models.  (The 2013 LG and Panasonic plasmas were good but the 2011 Panasonic entry-level plasmas were subpar like the 2013 Samsungs.)  I'm fortunate enough to have one of the top-of-the-line Panasonics with the glare filter and darker blacks, but if that were to break I'd be happy with this quality of Samsung, especially considering the 51\" is just over $600 and the 60\" is already under $900 (although Samsungs aren't as reliable as Panasonics).  The lack of glare filter on this shouldn't be a problem.  Swivel is nice.  TV is lightweight.  No wifi or Internet apps or anything but you're going to have all that on your Blu-ray anyway.  Black levels aren't too dark but they're fine.  Remember, we're talking about a $850 60\" TV.  As a side note, this is sitting locally next to the $4000 65\" Samsung UHD 4K 8500-series TV.  Of course the plasma has better colors but surprisingly, the LCD has darker blacks.TVs pixels are usually like this (Red, Blue, Green): RBG|RBG|RBG|RBG.  Sharp TVs (and I think some Samsung LCDs) are the same, but the pixels are actually cut in half where the bottom and top operate SEPARATELY for different levels of vibrance (this \"pixel splitting\" is why Sharp is now calling its TVs \"3k.\"  Normal TVs are 1080x1960 and called \"1080.\"  4k TVs are 2160x3920--I guess \"4k\" horizontally sounds cooler than \"2160\".  So, these 3k TVs, which are nothing new, are 2160x1960, but the pixels are a lot wider than they are tall.)This Samsung 60f5300, however, has the following pixel structure: GB|GR|GB|GR|GB|GR.  And the the line below, is GR|GB|GR|GB|GR|GB, which means that when looking VERTICALLY, every other line stacked up goes like this:BRBRBRand when standing within a few feet, this \"1080p\" TV looks as bad as a 51\" 720p TV.  My point is that this is not true 1080p because there are only TWO COLORS PER PIXEL--alternating GB and GB--and since there are only two colors, the pixel can be physically bigger and still make a legal 1080p while having pixels that look as big as a 720p.

If you're like me and your eyes are sensitive to light sources that flicker, then you'll probably hate this screen.I was prepared to pick up one of these TVs this afternoon and decided to head over to a local Best Buy to take a look before buying. I'm glad I did; I found the display in the store to be especially flickery in brightly-lit areas of the screen, To check whether this was just a case of a defective display model, I headed next door to Costco, only to find the same effect on the unit they had on display.When the displayed scene contained no bright areas, the image quality looked pretty good. It's obviously dimmer than a lot of LED-backlit LCD screens, but not unacceptably so. The upside is that since it's a plasma display, blacks are very dark, and there's a lot of detail in the dark areas of a scene. Glare from ambient lighting seemed about average; the screen is on the shiny side.However, the bright areas, especially whites, are unbearably flickery to my eyes, especially when caught in my peripheral vision. I really don't think I could watch this TV for more than a few minutes without it driving me completely mental.I should add that my eyes seem more sensitive than average to flickering flight sources. Some CFL bulbs flicker in my eyes where others see nothing, and I just can't stand most of the cheap LED bulbs that are currently on the market. The same goes for a lot of LED Christmas lights, which make my eyes go all wibbly, as do a lot of LED brake lights on cars and even the blue taxiway lights at a lot of airports.It's possible that the flickering is down to the screen being set in its in-store demo mode, with the brightness maxed out. If that's the case, then that doesn't bode well for the brightness of the set when turned down.I should also mention that this effect was also seen on this set's little 720p brother, and on a Panasonic plasma (model unknown); this effect does not seem to be restricted to this particular model, nor to Samsung's plasmas in particular.I'm bummed. This is a pretty price-competitive screen, and I'd heard great things about plasmas. It otherwise has great image quality with a high refresh rate, and plasma screens' power consumption has come way down (the yellow Energy Guide label says 144kWh for 5 hours a day, which works out a little under 80W) so they're no longer the space heaters they used to be.

However, Samsung has left off one simple little thing that creates an apparently unsolvable sound issue.  There is no headphone jack.  May seem like a little thing, but it's not.  It's a big enough problem to knock the star rating way down for me.  I'm writing this review to warn others who might have the same issues.  And in the hope that Samsung will see the review and say \"oh, yeah... I guess that was pretty dumb of us.\"If sound is not important to you, or you are sitting close to the set, then don't worry about this.  The picture is great.  Even the interior speakers are okay.  But this is a big TV, designed for a big room, and a lot of you are going to want external speakers, and a subwoofer for bass, right?  And of course, if you are buying the $700 model rather than the $1600 model, you probably aren't planning to spend an additional $500 or more just to improve the sound.  Like me, you want an economical alternative.  Well, you can't really have that with this TV.This set is a replacement for an older model Samsung.  On that TV, I used an inexpensive (about $70) but decent set of speakers with a sub-woofer to create great, rich sound without breaking the bank for a sound system that would cost as much as the set.  It was a great solution.  All you needed to do was plug it into the headphone jack.This TV?  No headphone jack.  Seriously, no headphone jack.  For the last several days I've been trying to find a work around.  I got a DAC converter so I could use the TVs Optical Audio cable, and blah, blah.... bottom line, it works, but there is now no way to control the volume accept manually adjusting the speakers. So, no muting obnoxious commercials or answering the telephone without walking over to the speakers.  That gets old right away.  I just finished wasting a couple hours on AV forums to confirm this... no way to fix this.  I can have better sound, but no control.Except of course by installing a very expensive system.  I even talked to a home theater installer about this.  He told me a low end sound bar is $150, but that my $70 solution with sub-woofer would sound much better.  Yeah, I know, it sounds great.  But I can't use it properly because there's no head phone jack.  Sure, after days of figuring, buying and installing a converter, etc...I have it working now, but I can't control it.  Basically I would need to pay several hundred dollars more to be able to mute my TV without getting up.Dear Samsung... next time you build something that involves sound, please install a headphone jack.  Thanks.

We had a dark living room, we wanted to have a great picture for video games and action movies, it seemed plasma was the way to go. We received the new TV with the excitement of seeing our new born child for the first time, only with a 60\" screen and no potty training involved. We got it set up and ready and put on Adventure Time! It was dim. We are watching Adventure Time, the brightest damn cartoon out there and the picture was dim. We changed some settings and it got a little better, except for the rhombus shaped reflection from a light in the kitchen around the corner. Turned off all the lights in the house. Still kinda dim, but watchable. My husband turns to me after about 5 minutes of watching Finn and Jake, \"Lets see what a BluRay looks like.\" In goes The 5th Element.This is where things go from \"meh\" to \"OH MY GOD MY BRAIN!\". There had been a high pitch hum coming from the TV the whole time. We knew plasmas made a hum. No big deal, right. Our PS3 sounded like a frikkin jet engine half the time. About 10 minutes in I started to feel an ache in my jaw, which traveled to the base of my spine and up my skull. Within 20 minutes I had a splitting headache. I paused the movie and informed my life mate of my pain. He said he also had a head ache. We turned off the TV and discussed our displeasure with our purchase. Shortly after, our headaches subsided.We went through the necessary steps to return the product, which included trouble shooting the device with Samsung. When I told the Samsung rep what the issue was he assured me that their TVs aren't suppose to cause headaches, that it may be a hardware problem and gave me a return # for it. On the up side, I had no trouble with the seller or Samsung returning it and getting a refund, so props to them.We ended up getting a Samsung LCD UN65F6300AF 65\" and it is AWESOME!!!! And we all lived happily ever after.The End", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Underachiever", "Author": "Frank", "ReviewID": "R1K68O4UAS7HN8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's not as sharp or as vibrant as I expected it to be.

Maybe $2,500.00 - $3,000.00 is not a lot of money for some folks to spend on a television, but it is to me.  This is money I'll never get back, nor derive true enjoyment, nor value from due to the DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG product that I purchased.  After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.  This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.  Consumer's have complained all over the internet.  There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in many other DEFECTIVE SAMUNG models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00!Furthermore, I was informed that the repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....at which point the technician basically stated, \"just buy another TV.\"SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at a rate of 20% per year, and that they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money on SYSTEMICALLY DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG TELEVISIONS, and a company that offers zero customer service....I'll be happy!
