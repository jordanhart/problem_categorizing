Of course, Amazon beat any other pricing by a wide margin - by at least $500 for the cheapest store bought price (on sale) and I even checked some stores on a walk in and they were charging $1,000 above the Amazon price or more.  Delivery was free and could not wait to get this set out of the box.  I researched a great many LCD's before picking this one.  I wanted the very latest technology to ward off obsolesence, at the best price I could find, and am not disappointed one bit by this set.  Easy set up, and just with the building's digital antenna, the picture is absolutely outstanding.  There are many presets, but with a bit of tweaking, as it appears with most LCDs, you get a terrific picture.  You can customize each preset if you wish.  Setting adjustments are intuitive and the screen navigation is very easy.  Sound is pretty decent as well, although I already have it hooked into my AV.  I have already watched sports, television and DVDs and all have been as crisp, vibrant, without drag or latency, as I have ever seen on an LCD this size.  The contrast ratio is just unreal and my eyes are still getting used to it.  Plenty of input/output options including plenty of HDMI and even ethernet and PC connections.  Having Fios HD installed this week and can't wait to see how it looks.  So far, am very satisfied and would definitely recommend at the price.

As expected, the picture is absolutely great.  If you want amazing HDTV, then this set is for you.  The TV has a very simple and understated front, which I like a lot.  The Amazon delivery was great!  Two men brought it into the house, put it where we wanted it, connected it, turned it on and checked the remote for operation.  The deliveryman was familiar with the TV and went above and beyond by doing the initial setup, which admittedly was simple, but not something he was required to do.  There are only two drawbacks so far.  The stand is flimsy feeling and wobbles like a weeble if you bump the set.  My XBR4 had a rock solid stand.  I just attached a cable to the wall for piece of mind (didn't want it falling on the grand kids).  The second thing is a lack of PIP or P&P;, both of which were on my KDL40XBR4.  Bottom line--love it so far.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV but still wondering if I should have opted for LED or Plasma...", "Author": "C. WILLIAMS", "ReviewID": "R1C3DD6EYYG8I1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV two weeks ago.  As an admitted unapologetic Sony \"fanboy\" I had high expectations.  The display is beautiful especially when viewing blu-ray's or HD sources.  However in an extremely dark scene it is evident that LCD's still have a ways to go when it comes to contrasting blacks.  I have played around with settings and even adjusted the custom setting to those recommended in CNet's review of the TV but it still leaves much to be desired.Pros:Excellent response time and display when viewing HD sources.A lot of options for customizing to fit your personal taste.A ton of extras (mostly accessed if/when you hook your TV up to your home internet network).  The widgets and video on demand are fun features but likely not something that will be for the average user.Cons:  Black contrasts still aren't near the level displayed in Plasmas and the LED technology also looks to be a major improvement in this area.Display of SD (standard definition/non HD) content leaves much to be desired.  Going from an old Sony 36\" CRT HDTV (HS510) standard definition played extremely well on that model and HD sources looked great also.  On this model (like with most LCD's) the SD sources look worse than they normally do on non HD tubes.One area that I have yet to decide if it is a pro or a con is the input jacks.  The back only has one HDMI input where as the side has 3.  I really think Sony should have put two on the back and two on the side but at least the ones on the side are recessed enough to where the wires aren't visible unless you are standing near the side of the tv.I have already gotten compliments on the glass bezel that surrounds the screen and this tv definitely passes the \"eye test\" as far as attractiveness.  The SONY logo at the bottom can be dimmed or turned off if you find it distracting (I thought this was a nice touch).I am happy with the purchase but all-in-all if I had to do it over I might wait for a 240Hz LED model by Sony or opt for a Plasma from a competitor.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wonderful TV", "Author": "David S \"David\"", "ReviewID": "R346KRE1HVEE54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tried the LG 47 inch LH40 and then the Samsung 46 inch LED B6000.

The matte finish on the screen is what attracted me to the TV in the first place.  The room where the TV sits is very bright and this really cuts down and almost eliminates glare on the screen.  I looked at Samsung LED TVs and the screen was shiny and there was a lot of glare, I could actually see clear reflections of objects in the room on the screen.  The ambient light sensor on the TV is a great feature.  It adjusts the brightness to compensate for the ambient room lighting.  In the evening the picture is not a bright as during the day.  The picture quality is excellent.  Guests have said it feels like you are actually part of what you are watching.Sony has done it again with the Bravia XBR.  I would highly recommend this product.  In addition the price on Amazon was unbelievable!Seven months after purchase I started having problems where the TV would make a clicking sound while it was OFF!  I just ignored it as this did not seem to affect the operation of the TV.  About 2 months after that started the clicking started, the audio would started turning off after about 2 hours, followed 5-20 seconds later by the video turning off.  While the audio and video were off the power and HD lights stayed off.  Then everything would turn off after about 5 seconds longer.  This was followed byeverything coming back on and working for another 2 hours.  This occurred 3 to 4 times a night.I called Sony and they sent a repairman who replaced the power board and the main board.  About a week later the problem started again.  I called Sony again and this time they had me call to schedule an appointment with Xpert Electronics in South Florida.  They took the TV and had it for 3 weeks and said there were no problems.  Two hours after they brought it back the problem started again.I contacted Sony and told them it was happening again and the customer service people, who are in Manila, just kept reading their platitudes.  In the interim I purchased a 32\" Sony so that I would have a TV while this TV was in the shop.  So now I have basically paid $500. for a warranty repair!SONY'S CUSTOMER IS THE WORST.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A SONY PRODUCT OF ANY KIND AGAIN!If you have no problems, you will love this TV.  If you have problems, you will see what I am talking about.

The picture is excellent and the built-in internet capability is exceptional.  We rent from Amazon movies all the time, which has saved money on our cable bill since we were able to reduce our plan.  The other TVs I compared were Samsung's LED, which is nice and light, but I worry about the reliability now, expecially since the technology is new.  I have seen both pictures and the XBR9 compares well with the LED.  Sony's XBR8 has the ultimate picture, but it is pricy and lacks the internet capability.  I also have a 52XBR6, which has a very vivid picture and I love it.  I haven't seen much difference with the faster speed of the XBR9, but it's nice to have it for high-speed action.  The price with Amazon was exceptional, and you want to watch prices from day to day because they vary several hundred dollars sometimes.  Amazon usually doesn't adjust the price you paid if a new price goes down in 30 days, but they were nice enough to do it in my case.  I also bought surge protectors from Amazon, but bought my heavy duty wall mount from another site.  Amazon is excellent and my new Sony was delivered with \"white glove\" efficiency and care.

All my entertainment equipment is Sony, and I've always been extremely happy with their products. Naturally, when it came time to replace our old TV (which lasted us 10 years and still works to this day), we looked to Sony. We purchased a Sony Bravia KDL-46XBR4 46\" in March of '08. It was a great TV... incredible set while it lasted. 13 months into ownership, we began seeing distortion horizontally across the top of the screen. First, it would only last a few minutes then gradually increased to an hour, until finally we couldn't watch anything on it anymore.We called Sony, complaining that it was only a couple of months out of warranty. A $2,700 TV should last for longer then a year! Finally, they agreed to a 'one-time' repair... they gave us a claim number and told us to bring it to an authorized repair shop. We shelled out $100 for the diagnosis, but when Sony found out that the panel was bad and would cost $1,500 to replace, they refused to honor their promise. I had a claim number and the name of the person I spoke with, but it didn't matter. Apparently, Sony representatives don't 'represent' anything... if Sony doesn't think it's in their best interest, they'll break their promises at will. I was absolutely furious and after talking with several supervisors, I was finally connected with someone who offered us a KDL-46XBR9 as a replacement... but we had to pay over $300 to get it. Normally not a bad deal, but considering Sony initially promised that they would cover everything to get it fixed, I didn't like the idea of spending ANYTHING more on this. I finally agreed, since I had no other choice. When I went to pick the broken TV up from the repair shop, I was told by the shop owner that they had four other Sony LCDs in the shop, and all four had bad panels.Two weeks later, in September of 2009, we had the new TV. Picture on the BR9 was noticeably smoother and sharper then the BR4. It had the same size screen as our BR4, but the overall size is smaller and it's much lighter. One thing I really liked was the Internet connection... the BR9 has widgets for a variety of online video sites, including Youtube, which brings a whole new dimension to televisions. Despite the misery of dealing with Sony, I was happy with the TV. The TV was great... until April 2010 when I starting having trouble with it only seven months into ownership. At random times, when turning the TV on after it's been off overnight, the audio would cut out, and then it would finally shut itself off. After turning it back on, everything was fine. The light on the front would flash out an error code that pointed to various problems, all seeming to center around a power supply problem. We didn't have time to deal with it at the time, but the problem went away by itself after a week, but I was still quite frustrated by the fact that we were already dealing with trouble from a SECOND Sony LCD TV.Now, 10 months into ownership, we're getting horizontal lines flash across the TV. A brief search on the internet found that this was a common problem with Sony LCDs and that it meant that the panel was going bad. AGAIN?!?!I will be calling Sony ASAP and I'm hoping that since we are still within warranty that things will go smoother this time, however this does not take anything away from the fact that this is our SECOND Sony LCD to die in the last year. Very disappointing for a product that costs so much, and very inconvenient. I still would buy Sony equipment, but I would NEVER buy a Sony LCD again.... never.If you have any interest in buying a new TV and expect to use it more then a year, I cannot stress this enough: Do Not Buy a Sony. There are complaints about Sony LCD panel problems all over the Internet, and considering replacing the panels is nearly the cost of the TV itself, you might end up throwing money away.

Free delivery, box arrived in pristine condition, it looked like it had just been pulled off the packaging line, no dents, tears or even scratches in the cardboard.  So far so good...  The delivery guys unpacked it, put the stand on and plugged it in.  I was trying not to salivate.It was a breeze to set up.  Coax cable to HDD recorder, HDMI to TV.  2nd HDMI from Sony Blu-ray to TV.  Done!  I turned on the tv, autoscan picked up the analog and digital stations (took about 30 minutes) and I was watching the news in high def. Wow, the picture was stunning, right out of the box.  Oops, forgot, also coax from HDD recorder to TV.I have watched 4 movies, the blu-ray is stunning.  At first I noticed a mild \"flashlight\" effect in the lower left corner in dark scenes while watching Bladerunner in a dark room.  I watched it again 4 days later (again in a dark room) and it was gone, so maybe it was my imagination.  The blacks are good, not as good as LED or plasma, but really good.  If the room lights are on, the blacks are black.  For $1,000 less than a comparable 240hz led backlit model it is a no-brainer in my opinion.  The PQ is just amazing.  Some of the explosions on the Bond flick I was watching appeared as if pieces were flying out of the screen.  I was expecting some 3D effect, but this was ridiculous!  I was so entranced that at times I forgot to follow the plot.  Planet earth blu-ray also spectacular.  The 3D effect is again breathtaking.  It feels like you are on the plane/helicopter with the film crew!About the sound.  I was expecting it to be really bad, due to a few reviews I read.  I am an audiophile with my music, but keep my sound system separate from the TV (different rooms).  I was hoping to not need to buy a receiver/speakers but was skeptical that the sound would cut it for me.  But it is not bad.  I tweaked the settings to my liking and the dialogue is crystal clear.  There is a little \"surround\" effect using the front surround setting.  I was really impressed.  Let's face it, most people will be using external speakers.  Now, my room is small with 7' ceilings, which I am sure helps the sound work for me.  I can see how this would not be powerful enough in a great room type setting, or a more open area in general.At this time I only have one complaint.  There is only 1 hdmi input in the rear panel, the other 3 are on the side.  With my cables, there is no way to completely hide the one plugged into the side.  Maybe there are cables with an \"L\" type connection that would keep the cable around the back.  Eventually I will find a way to tie it back behind the TV with a zip tie.  For now I am way too busy watching movies on this beautiful piece of HT equipment.  My next order of business will be to connect to my high speed network with a wireless bridge to access Amazon and Netflix for streaming HD!For the price....

Furthermore, I just realized the LCD panel is actually made by Samsung NOT Sony. If you buy a Sony TV; why is the LCD Panel (the most important and expensive part of the TV) is made in Korea by Samsung.  The picture might be good but how long will it last.....for me it only lasted 1 year and 4 months.  Also If you do a simple search on Amazon you will find that Amazon does not sell Sony XBR LCD TV directly anymore since I guess they have so many complaints from their customers on the Sony LCD TV. Go ahead look and see you can find Amazon selling Sony XBR LCD TV directly...Amazon actually refer you to another brand like LG or other brands when you are looking any Sony XBR LCD TVs.....and my Full Story below:5/9/2010- I brought the Sony XBR series TV on Amazon about 1 year and 4 months ago and now the TV have failed. The picture quality was amazing until just yesterday the picture started to degrade and now it has green clouds and rainbows all over the pictures. I just call the Sony authorize tech service from they said it will cost me $75 for the in house service since it's out of warranty. They also said that if it's the LCD panels has failed then it would cost as much as the TV itself. This is my first LCD from Sony but I have 3 other Sony TVs- 1 30\" Sony CRT, 1 47\" XBR rear projection and 1 65\" XBR rear projection TV. All the previous Sony TVs had no problem at all and I am still using the 65\" rear projection TV. What happen to Sony's quality and reliability product? I guess it went to the same place as other first rated Japanese products like Toyota. They are just too busy on cutting cost and lower their reliabilities so they can rack in the billion dollars profit. So if you like the picture quality of Sony TVs; be advice to buy their extended warranty.  I wish I did because if the LCD panel failed then my LCD TV is just a big 52\" black picture frame hanging on the wall.  If you really, really have to get a Sony XBR LCD TV then I would recommend to get 5 years extended warranty plan for $299-it will save you a lot of frustration. And after 5 years, you will probably do a upgrade anyway.5/11/2010 update: Today the tech came and verified that the LCD panel has gone bad after 1 year and 4 months of service. In the tech's own words-the panel is a factory defect since it should not failed after just a little over a year of service and that I should call Sony and see they will reimburse the cost of the panel. I am so disappointed on the product since I did not just buy any Sony TV but the top of the line XBR series TV. I called Sony and told them the whole story but they just told me to fax all the documents -receipt and repair cost to Sony and they will evaluate it. I will wait and see what happen - but at this point I am really disappointed and frustrated with the whole thing! :-(Update: 5/13/2010-Just received a call from Sony \"Customer Relations\" today.  It's official-Sony don't stand behind their products.  They will not pay for the cost of their defective LCD panel since it's out of warranty (1 year) after 1 year and 4 month of service. They just lost a loyal customer. No more Sony products in my house.  Sony customer relations representative even has the nerve to offer me $900 reimbursement on a $$3517.75 repair cost. That's right-I will have to pay $2617.76 to fix my $2018.88 LCD TV.  So if you buy a Sony TV and you have a defective LCD panel after 1 year of use then you can just throw that TV in the trash because Sony will tell you go F yourself and trash the TV.  Good luck on buying a Sony LCD TV because you going to need it-and looks like from my research, I am not the only customer that have a defect LCD panel after 1 year.  In fact, the LCD panel is not even made by Sony but Samsung made in Korea.  Samsung LCD Panels have notoriously for premature failure of their LCD panels.

If you're looking for a bargain, you really need to be patient and look at online deals practically every day. That's how I found the deal I got thru Amazon.

BUT, I wanted to stick to my plan - be patient, pick one or two TV models I would be really happy to own and wait...wait for the right (crazy-right!) prize. And the day came (and went really fast!)

In researching a new TV, we learned of the special extended warranty on the 46 in models and of numerous reports of similar problems in the 52 inch products.  Breaking through customer support, we got to consumer affairs.  They insisted on a report from a Sony approved repair shop and proof of purchase.  110.00 dollars later once again we we informed that the problem was a defective panel.  Two levels of customer affairs later Sony's response was \"we'll assist you with covering 25% of the parts\".  Sony will not even refund the wasted $ 110.00 on the service call they insisted on.  The Sony approved repair tech and our installer both have said they have experienced similar responses from Sony, but that a few customers have their entire repair cost on these 52 inch TV's covered fully.  Needless to say, Sony is not a honorable company.  If you chose to avoid Sony products please note that Samsung is now strongly affiliated with Sony.FYI  There is also a problem with an electronic module at the top of the these KDL XBR's.  The problem source can be differentiated by the fact that if the module is responsible, the Sony menus are unaffected.  Sony also has a huge problem with their rear projection TV lamps melting the outside housingCaroleSony BRAVIA XBR Series KDL-46XBR9 46-Inch 1080p 240Hz LCD HDTV, BlackSony BRAVIA V-Series KDL-52V5100 52-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV, BlackSony BRAVIA XBR Series KDL-52XBR9 52-Inch 1080p 240 Hz LCD HDTV, BlackSony BRAVIA V-Series KDL-46V5100 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV, BlackSony BRAVIA Z Series KDL-52Z5100 52-Inch 1080p 240Hz LCD HDTVSony BRAVIA V-Series KDL-46V5100 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV, BlackSony BRAVIA Z Series KDL-46Z5100 46-Inch 1080p 240Hz LCD HDTVSony BRAVIA V-Series KDL55V5100 55-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD TV, BlackSony BRAVIA S-Series KDL-46S5100 46-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV, Black", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture, does not disappoint", "Author": "White Collar Nomad", "ReviewID": "R3K4CVUZYSCEHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV last weekend, so have had it for 1 week now, and must say that is nearly perfect. The picture quality of HD broadcasts (over TimeWarner cable) is very good, and standard broadcasts are not bad at all (better than expected). The audio is quite good as well, even though I will eventually upgrade to a home theatre system, but for now, it is more than acceptable.

After researching them for a couple months, I had narrowed it down to Samsung and Sony in the $1,300-1,500 price range. I choose the Sony because the picture looked more natural. I have to agree with others that reviewed the Samsung that the colors were almost too bright and the off angle view was not as sharp. I couldn't have made a better choice. This TV is amazing. The picture is clear and the HD is great, especially with blu-ray and PS3 games. I can sit back at my dining room table and view the picture from a 35 degree angle with no dark spots or distortion. I only have to have the brightness at a 40 percent level. I've read some reviews that you have to really tweak the picture settings to get the picture right, but I thought it was just fine right out of the box. The pre-set picture modes are easy to toggle through for movies or regular TV, and the 240 hz refresh rate makes games, action movies, and sports flow smoothly without any blur. As for the sound, many people complain about LCD TVs in general, but I thought this one was good. I do have to have the level turned up to 30 and it lacks some bass, but it's much better than I had expected. Lastly, the inputs and outputs are plenty. Has a digital out so I could hook into my stereo.

Neer", "ReviewID": "R12MYXIDOMWNF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Sony Bravia LCD television , previously I had purchased the 32\" XBR6 so I had some kind of idea as what to expect.The XBR9 series is internet ready which allowed me to connect to the internet (for video streaming) without the use of a PC (used with my XBR6). Netflix is coming on board as a streaming provider apparently in November and we are very much looking forward to that. I had to use a wireless ethernet bridge to connect to my broadband but that was easy as the TV's network setup supports wireless bridges. Connection to the broadband also allows media stored on other networked PCs to be played on the TV (the PCs use Windows Media Player to make themselves DLNA servers) so sharing vacation pictures and listening to MP3s remotely on the TV is now possible. Back to the video streaming and actual internet content (limited good stuff) - other than Netflix, which is coming, there are movies available from Amazon.com  - did this have something to do with the great price of the set from Amazon?The picture is simply breath taking. 46\" is big enough. I do observe that the picture does have a little bit of a problem with subjects that have bright light reflecting off them - like a baseball player's white uniform with the sun shining directly on it - a little saturated I think. TV sound has plently of volume and sounds good...however there appears to be a Yamaha sound bar and sub woofer in piano black that looks like it was made to go with this set...Delivery was through Pilot Air - if they don't call you to schedule delivery then you need to call them (1-800-HI-PILOT).

One is for the current seller Video and Audio Center. I left seller feedback and immediately received a call from them. The feedback was that the box was a shambles when the TV was delivered. I stated the TV was fine and was working great. I was not expecting a call from them and was shocked when I did. They offered to replace the television no questions asked or to offer an extended warranty for 3 additional years at no cost (because I had already stated in my feedback the TV was fine). There was nothing wrong with the TV (no scratches, picture issues, cracks, remote issues etc...) so I am not so anal as to demand they replace it and excepted the extended warranty so if anything does go wrong I am covered. This took place within probably one hour from me leaving feedback. Amazing customer service and I would recommend them highly as a seller to buy your home theater equipment from. Secondly, the TV is awesome. Up and running within 20 mins (approx.) and could not be happier. Pre-ordered Lord of the Rings (yep, do not care if it's not the extended versions cause I will buy them later) and look forward to watching them. 2012, The Blind Side, The Untouchables, and Star Trek all looked unbelievable and it was like watching them for the first time at the theater.

Millar", "ReviewID": "R350H2M7L2WYJ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Sony Bravia XBR9 for just a few days now, but I can pass my observations along about the LCD TV and also with how well Amazon's door to door service went.Needless to say, shipping was pretty fast. In fact so fast that I had to get the delivery company to hold onto it for a couple of days until I was available. As for CEVA, the delivery company, it wasn't white glove service, but I don't have any complaints. They did call to schedule a delivery date and time and they did arrive when they said they were going to arrive. It was just one person delivering the TV though, and rather than having him handle my TV all alone, I gave him a hand to bring it in. He did help me remove it from the box and install it on the stand, then wanted to make sure it turned on, so I can't complain. The condition was flawless out of the box, so large, expensive, vulnerable items like LCD TV's that are being shipped can arrive without anything to worry about.As for the TV itself; the picture is bright and I mean really bright. It's absolutely amazing when watching it using an HD channel. I watched the Yankees vs the Philly's Baseball game on Fox HD and the picture quality was faultless. If only all channels were in HD. The standard definition channels are still good, but Cox cable's compression brings out the flaws and I hope they bring HD to the forefront with all their channels in the near future. It's not the TV's fault, it's trying to make the best out of what it has to work with, but you really do get spoiled with HD content.My only negative point, as it seems with all LCD TV's, is with the sound. Don't get me wrong, it's plenty loud and I'll probably be shopping around for a home theater setup pretty soon, but its still not on the same level compared to how good the picture quality is. There's a bunch of sound settings and a custom equalizer that I'll probably mess around with to improve things, but if I had to nitpick about one area that lets the whole package down, it would be the sound. In its defense, I don't think I've heard or read a review yet where an LCD TV has been judged with excellent sound on its own, so I'd put the Bravia XBR9 in the good range.After owning it for just a few days, the bottom line is I'm highly praising the XBR9 for its magnificent picture, would say the built in speakers will get you by but suggest a home theater setup. Amazon's price for this TV is excellent and after e-mailing them because of a price drop, they also refunded me the difference. It's the reason I will continue to do business with them because of their prices and the great customer service.********************************************Just an update, netflix streaming has now officially been added to all Sony bravia internet capable TV's and it's a great feature. Runs smooth as butter. Love this TV.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is a Great TV and will be the Full Package if it Holds Up", "Author": "E. West \"Suthrner\"", "ReviewID": "R2KLOG3L8KBLHW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my 46\" XBR9 now for two weeks and I have no regrets.Let preface my opinions to come by saying that after much research this my first flat screen TV but as I said above I have no regrets.The first thing that caught my eye, right out of the box, was the styling. This TV has very thin bezel with the clear accent covering an all black frame which will look nice in any room.There should be no complaints about the sound from anyone. It's plenty loud enough for everyday viewing and you'll need a home theater system to get that 5.1 experience from any TV you buy. This TV will not output 5.1 sound via the optical out with an HDMI input but it will output 5.1 sound via the optical out from the over the air signal through the coax input and network content, such as Amazon Video On Demand, through the network input. If it's in 5.1, I usually use my Home Theater System but if just digital I'll usually just use the TV speakers.I have an HDTV antenna mounted in my attic and the majority of my time in front of this TV is spent watching sports and prime time shows on the various networks from this over the air signal.  Standard SD is decent compared to my old CRT but where this TV really shines in when watching 1080i and 720p content. I usually watch TV with a lamp on and the TV set to  the Standard settings except I turn off all the processing features except Motionflow for sports. The picture is great and I do occasionally notice some blocking when the picture is panning but it's only distracting close up and not a problem from about 12 feet where I sit, so getting the correct screen size for your viewing area is important. I have found that not all 1080i is the same, may be the reason some don't like the SD content. What I mean is the content from my local network affiliates can't compare with the content shown from the networks such as prime time shows and sports and usually prime time is shown in 720p which is flawless.I am a huge movie buff and I use a Sony Blue-Ray Player BDP-S360 via HDMI. I like to watch my movies with the lights out so I use the CNET settings because the standard settings in low light are blinding. Whether it's my standard DVD's unconverted or Blue-Ray the picture is outstanding. In my opinion the blacks are very good and I have seen some flashlighting when the screen is completely black but that rarely happens when watching anything and I must either be getting used to it or the TV is going the \"break-in\" process because I don't notice it much anymore. I probably could of gotten deeper blacks with plasma but my room as a lot of ambient lighting during the day and this TV has a nice matte screen with very little to no glare because I do watch TV during the day.I have also streamed movies from Amazon Video on Demand via a network cable on my Home Network and these movies are excellent as they are shown as high as 720p with 5.1 surround sound. It will detect your connection speed and send the highest quality possible so the faster your connection the better the quality. My speed is in 3.5 mb/sec range and the videos are smooth with outstanding PQ.This TV is packed with features and the menus are easy to navigate. One great feature is that the TV saves your settings for each input which works great for me because I watch over the air through the coax input and movies through the HDMI input and the TV automatically changes the setting when I change inputs. Folks who use their Home theater system to output all their sources through one HDMI input may have to change their settings because it may not automatically change the settings for you but again the menus are fast and easy to navigate.In conclusion I must say that I am very pleased with this purchase and do it all over again, especially since I got for around 1500 clams with shipping included.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "excellent TV i have nothing bad to say about it", "Author": "Simon Lopez", "ReviewID": "R2VS1RVGZXOENY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i must say this looks really amazing the picture quality in HDTV and in the ps3, the sound is excellent, it has many hdmi ouputs, the xmb is abosolutely great if you want a very good tv Lcd you should buy this one you won't regret it.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good TV", "Author": "M.

The picture quality is great and what we expected, I think the blacks look black, but I'm not at the tech level where I notice those fine details all that closely.  I wish the jump and muting buttons were more prominent, like on our previous Sony, but that's a small item.  This comes with 4 speakers, and the sound is still weak sometimes, noticed mostly on blu-ray movies.  As thin as the TV is I never expected great sound, but I thought doubling the number of speakers as this set does would be acceptable, but not really.  We just ordered a Sony AV receiver and speakers and that will take care of that problem (and we'll have surround sound - our slow shuffle into the 21st century).BTW, we also ordered a 32\" Panasonic LCD for the bedroom on an Amazon \"Gold Box\" sale for $379 a couple of weeks after we got the Sony, and the picture on that is fantastic also.

Unlike a few who saw no significant effect, I am impressed with the 240hz performance, and with other adjustments which do not significantly interplay, requiring endless back and forth tweaking. The XBR9 delivers totally accurate skin tones from chalk white to ebony black. The sound is OK for viewing local newscasts, etc., but not for entertainment programming, which I play through a Marantz A/V and a bi-amped Klipsch front (I am a dedicated 5.1 fan). The results (via COMCAST) approach theater-quality, and awesome when viewing Blurays through my OPPO BDP-83. The standard definition channels, which vary between broadcasters, are noticeably better than my 40-inch SONY delivered.

But I know too much than to suggest that the people who warn you away from Sony TVs are just sourpusses.  They are telling true stories of pain, from $1,000 - $2,500 purchases.  So I spend far more time on the \"issues\" with the TV than the positives, but I give it a solid 4 stars (would do 4.5 if you could) based on my own experience.  Here goes:I purchased the KDL46-XBR9 in November 2009 and nothing has ever gone wrong with it and the picture quality is as good as it was the day it was new.  I'm sure I would not like it as much if I looked at it next to a 2012 LED HDTV but with HD or Blu Ray source material the picture is bright, contrast excellent, color saturation very good and everything just \"works!\"  We have not only owned this for 27 months, but it has been on for an overall average of about 4 hours per day for each of those 824 days!Ok, now for the less wonderful things about it:1) The TV does turn itself off every 45 mins if you don't see the warning that tells you it's going to, some 5 minutes in advance.  It's an energy saving setting that you can change but, frankly, the few times it catches us unaware, we just turn it right back on and there's no warm up time, it goes right to the channel you were on.  It's not that hard to toggle the \"feature\" off, but it does save energy when someone leaves the room and stays away longer than expected.  I needed to explain this so that the complaints of it turning off (and the comical/irritating stories of technicians that can't get the \"part\" to fix it) are not problems with the TV, only with its operators - and service techs!2) As some have complained, the Internet based programming (Netflix, Amazon, etc) did experience early growing pains, but I read quite a bit and learned that for the first year or so that these services were available through TVs and other boxes there was a three-way finger pointing game between the TV makers, the Internet Service Providers and the box makers as to whose fault it was that the broadcast would suddenly freeze and may not work again until you unplugged the TV for 60 seconds and let everything reset itself.  We stopped using it for a while, but since about early 2011 these services work find about 90% of the time.  For such advanced technology requiring so much coordination between disparate companies, that's pretty darned good.  These days, all 3 parts of the TV via Internet streaming equation do automatic over-the-air updates to firmware and software so the service should get better and better without requiring new equipment, except a new router, which should be replaced every 2 years or so.3) The internal sound is, to be kind, barely acceptable.  It would be a shame to have programming with such awesomely powerful audio built right in and not have the benefit of hearing - and FEELING! - the sound.  For as little as $49 you can get a Logitech 5.1 system that sounds fabulous.  From there, the sky's the limit!4) For the first year I enjoyed but did not love the picture quality.  Then one day I went experimenting with all the advanced controls, Googling any term I did not understand.  I am still blown away, more than a year later, how gorgeously bright and colorful (yet still natural) this picture is.  So take comments about the picture quality being so-so with a grain of salt.  It's true that it shouldn't take so much research and experimentation to get it right (Best Buy offered to come to our house and do it - for $300!!), but it's actually pretty easy once you get a few concepts like \"Gamma\" and \"White Balance\" understood.  Plus, you can see the changes as you fiddle with the 20+ adjustments available so you can just let your eyes tell you when it looks good to you.5) It's clear from reading these reviews, and many articles about Sony (and I own a Sony Vaio computer and it's the same) that Sony service is close to the worst in the industry and the reason a TV like this gets an average 4-star rating is because some 75% have no trouble and rate it 4 or 5 star and 25% have problems and, deservedly, give it 1 star.  Fortunately, I knew about Sony's horrific service and got an extended warranty (for a very fair price at the time) from Best Buy. Of course, it was only a 3 yr wtty and the way things are going it will have been a waste, but good insurance.  Don't buy a Sony product for more than $300 without getting a third-party (and highly rated) extended warranty.To all who have had misery at the hands of Sony Corporation, my compassion is with you.

I'm glad I put casters on the TV cabinet when I built it.I don't like having 3 of 4 connections coming off the side, but I think Sony was thinking that you'd run all of your A/V component outputs to an A/V receiver, and then a single HDMNI cable to the HDMI input in back. Then, you could easily  temporarily plug other stuff into the side connectors without crawling around behind the TV.I had a little bit of trouble getting the set to receive programs off the air until I replaced a cheap RF cable with a good quality one. (The center conductor needs to extend past the sheild that slides or screws onto the connector.

The day I noticed the LED I went back home and did tons of research and noticed Sony had an Led tv also, but it was only a 19 inch Organic led display which cost as much as the samsung 55 inch led. I was then discouraged for either brand and said forget it. After a while this 120 hz and 240 hz motionflow technology came around then I decided to look for a tv again. After some extensive research on many sets I decided to go with this set the xbr9, this is abosoluty the best set I have ever laid my eyes on, wathcing blu rays on this makes you feel like ur actually there with the actors, playing games on this set is bananas. I see things, in movies and games, that I never saw before. Now say what you want to say about price, but if your someone like me who likes a tv to last more than 5 years then what are you waiting for. Believe me I have a 2003 rear projection tv that has never been serviced and its working perfect. All in all you can never go wrong with Sony televisions. look if you dont have a blu ray player or ps3 you will never learn to appreciate a tv of this magnitude. Oh yeah and to all those people who complain about internet features not being responsive, call your internet provider to fix your problem its free, and to all those that have Hd programing, supposedly, how can you get digital HD if your still connecting your tv's through the cable.

I had to purchase a soundbar to get adequate sound.  There is almost no bass from the TV even though I had set it to the max level.

I like sony and i wanted a sony HDTV so the offer got me like a fly on a spiderweb. The TV came exactly right on time, i first opened all excited but i kinda knew something was up with it to cost so little. It had a little scratch on the top left side of the TV and the tv edges were a bit dirty/scraped under the glass framing thing. This kind of upsetted me but then again its not a new hdtv and once i hooked everything up and turned it on, the tv worked perfectly fine. Really bright clear and colorful feeds. And the blacks in this tv are good the best i seen so far but then again i dont go HDTV comparing. And yes of course you can fix its settings to your liking with the options menu.  The sound is pretty good. I never really owned a theater speaker system unit but the TV can get pretty loud, and my old hdtv couldnt do that. Its pretty crisp but i will still buy a speaker unit later on. Blu ray movies look awesome in it with its motionflow making the experience even better. And there are more options to enhance your movie viewing experience. The regular HD channels look almost as awesome as bluray movies. I havent used those online widgets yet but i probably wont anyways, i havent checked them all to be honest. Plus I got a PS3 so its probably almost the same thing. The whole setting up of the TV on my tvstand was pretty easy. The tvs menu options and everything else is easy to navigate and you have many sorts of options to play with. So you really cant complain you wasted money on something you might not consider worthy of a purchase. But this TV is good and worth the money. Oh and about the scrape you can barely notice it since the TV is black all around so it basically disappears. And the little scratch isnt noticeable unless you put your eye on it. But with a screen so big you wont ever notice it especially with the nice quality picture it delivers on 46''. PROS- Great TV nothing really bad about it. Unless your some experienced HDTV expert you may dislike this over other HDTVs.. but im oversatisfied with my SONY XBR9 HDTV.

I purchased the TV along with BluRay and home theater.  With HD inputs (RF, HDMI, etc) the picture quality is stunning, absolutely stunning.  The detail and color intensity blow me away on HDTV programming and especially DVDs and BluRays.  The TV speaker audio quality is excellent also considering what little Sony has to play with here in terms of speaker placement and cabinet acoustics.  The bottom firing speakers offer good sound quality with an extremly clean appearance to the panel.  Despite this, the home theater system ( I got the HTSS360) is an amazing auditory leap from the TV alone, so put that in your cart also to take the next step.  My one wish is that analog picture quality (yes I'm a tightwad for some things, at least for now) was better.  It is inferior to my 32\" Sony that is 10 years old, even when compensating for picture size.  (You'll likely get used to it after a bit, I did.)  But I knew this going in. Analog and SD picture quality is a not too uncommon complaint on HDTV's, some manufacturers more than others.  (Sony is actually not the best here if you believe Consumer Reports) Something in the analog to digital conversion (I've read various technical explanations) simply gets lost.  After all, analog reception and display has been refined over 70 years.  So be prepared to get an HD upgrade from your cable company or go satellite I suppose to avoid this.

We packed it back up and returned it for a full refund.This experience combined with many other testimonials from Sony owners and the pathetic customer service and factory warranties that Sony offers now puts Sony close the bottom of the barrel when picking electronic for me from now on.  They started out as a throw away cheap junk company back in the day.  They did an amazing job of rising to the top some years back, but they have now come full circle.  They are back to being the worst offering out there for the price.  Do youself a favor and look at Samsung, LG, Sharp and, if you can take the price, Mitsubishi but don't waste your time with Sony.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "A short lived experience with XBR9 and returned back to BestBuy", "Author": "Hans Blix", "ReviewID": "R1RVGN7P0NIY5E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I realize that folks usually don't like others' negative reviews on products they think they may like, but, it is what it is. This is not a good TV folks!!I owned this TV for three weeks and then decided to return back to Best Buy which had the best price on this particular model and screen size, even better than Amazon, which is very rare.The TV's design is simply awesome, typical Sony attribute. Its bezel is non-glossy, very thin and non-bulky, making it occupy less space on stand than TVs in similar size and look really classy. Something Samsung should copy. Though not an LED, it is thin for a regular LCD TV. SONY logo on lower bezel slowly lights up when TV is turned on. Cool. SONY remote and menu system are second the none I must admit. Something else Samsung should copy. But that is up to where Samsung should copying from Sony.This TV has, if not horrible, very very bad black level handling. Almost non-existent Dark areas screens are almost grayish, bluish pixalated. In some occasions, to watch a movie with night scenes were really annoying. Despite having near-excellent light scene performance, XBR9 failed miserably in black areas.I know this, because I own a 32\" XBR3 which has excellent blacks. I was therefore compare two Sony TVs side by side with the same calibrations as well as different calibration levels. Despite all the calibration efforts with the help of many AVS sites I found with Google, nothing helped. Even the BestBuy Magnolia expert admitted the problems with blacks in Sony HDTVs.240MHZ does not mean much as the broadcasters still uses 60 MHz, and Blu-Ray uses 120 MHz. The  Cinemotion option, as we all know well, make movies look like a daytime soap operas. As I experienced at BestBuy, this TV looked awesome with a Blu-ray playing. But I am not using blu-ray but instead getting movies via FIOS. Could I be getting better picture results with a blu-ray? Perhaps, but most consumers utilize the HDTV woth their cable, broadcast or FIOS content. To depend on blu-ray to prove an HDTV's picture quality alone is not acceptable.I was able to stream 720p HD Netflix movies (though not he new releases) via Ethernet cable easily. The results were very pleasing, still with black level issues though.As a result, as along term SONY fan I had to returned this and instead purchase a newer, 2010 model Sony LED Sony Bravia EX700 Series 46-Inch LED HDTV, Black ,only to find out it to be worse not only in black levels but also picture quality with terrible blooming effects. XBR9 at least had a good picture quality where the scenes were not dark. But, EX700 will be another review.In conclusion, XBR9 would be an excellent TV, if it could handle blacks well. But it does not.Should buy it ? I'd say no, not if it is less then $1K as a second TV.After testing two Sony models in 3 weeks, I have concluded that SONY as a HDTV maker has lost its charm. By the way, I eventually ordered a Samsung UN46B8500 46-Inch 1080p 240 Hz LED HDTV. Lets see how it works. I doubt it will be worse than a Sony.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Scratch", "Author": "rj \"rj\"", "ReviewID": "R2H0H1PF8CA0XB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the tv is great!  5 stars.however, the scratch is hard to live with.  must have been the shipping company's fault.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Audio/SOund Output Sucks", "Author": "M.
