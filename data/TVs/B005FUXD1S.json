{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unreal looking TV", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R2QKAYHS5YLNZJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall this TV is epic, I'm surprised to see such poor reviews here as they are great elsewhere. This TV used to cost over 7 thousand dollars, I got mine for a hair over 1600! It has it's flaws, but overall it's worth it.  Heres my take:Cons--TV Drops WiFi for no reason, LAN connection some how does not seem to help? Oh and the wifi isn't built in....includes an external adapter that hogs a usb port.-Remote has a learning curve-Bezel isn't super thinPros--This TV is so thin it's like some kind of joke, It brings a smile to my face every time I walk by it.-Remote is epic once you get used to it, the twin view is awesome and I've never had any problems with it not working-The motorized physical touch sensitive button deck is slick-Picture is amazing, very impressive blacks for an edge lit, precision dimming at work I guess.I bought a 55 edge lit sammy earlier this year and had to return it because the flashlighting was terrible. When I powered this on it had some minor flashlighting and I was heart broken, but for reasons beyond my understanding it simply went away after a few hours of use. Now you can only notice the backlight if you are moderately off angle which is fine with me. I had a little buyers remorse when I noticed the D series TVs for a couple hundred less with better specs and those nice thin bezels, but then I noticed they are literally 4 times thicker. I also like that this TV is titanium as opposed to plastic, I keep it on it's stand and move it depending where I am in the room and the cold and solid feel of metal is very pleasing and a joy to look at (and surprisingly disappears into the dark when using the TV)I'm not a videofile, but I definitely pay more attention to PQ then the average consumer and this TV is excellent. I haven't got to try the 3D yet but it's supposed to match plasmas in quality....we will see. If you want the absolute top of the line PQ you probably want to look elsewhere, but this TV doubles as a piece of art, your jaw will drop before you even power it on :)", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "un46c9000", "Author": "ROBERT VANDYKE", "ReviewID": "R13OIU9IKIDQVS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think the TV picture is great.The touch remote sucks, when working properly it is quite unique.The Twin View is neat when it works.Only works when it wants to.Am going to contact Samsung for a new remote or a partial credit for the entire purchase price.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Wayne J.

THE REMOTE IS FINICKY. YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP A CERTAIN TOUCH TO BE ABLE TO USE THE CONTROLS WITHOUT ACCIDENTALLY PRESSING THE WRONG BUTTON. THE TOUCHSCREEN ON AN IPHONE IS MUCH EASIER TO USE.THE TV CONSTANTLY DROPS THE WIRELESS CONNECTION AND HAS CONNECTION ISSUES.  ALL OTHER COMPUTERS, IPHONES, LAPTOPS, ETC ON THE SAME WIRELESS NETWORK HAVE NO PROBLEMS CONNECTING. WHEN THE CONNECTION IS DROPPED, YOU MUST NAVIGATE THRU THE MENUS AND RE ENTER YOUR WIRELESS PASSWORD TO RECONNECT. SERIOUSLY... YOU HAVE TO RE ENTER YOUR WIRELESS PASSWORD EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO RE CONNECT.ALL TOGETHER THE TV IS BEAUTIFUL AND HAS A GREAT PICTURE, BUT IS A PAIN IN THE BUTT TO USE. CONNECTION ISSUES PLAGUE THIS TV. REMOTE IS COOL LOOKING BUT AS OTHER USERS HAVE STATED, GETTING THE SOFTWARE TO WORK IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.IF YOU BUY THIS TV, EXPECT A VERY COMPLEX DIFFICULT SETUP, DIFFICULTY GETTING THE WIRELESS TO WORK CORRECTLY AND STAY CONNECTED, AND A TOUGH TIME GETTING THE REMOTE TO WORK WITH ALL FEATURES AS ADVERTISED.ALL IN ALL I LIKE THE LOOKS AND THE PICTURE QUALITY BUT THIS TV WAS RELEASED BEFORE THE BUGS WERE WORKED OUT.
