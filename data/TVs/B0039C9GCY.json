{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent 37\" HD TV", "Author": "Albert J. Valentino", "ReviewID": "R3O5DLJQN8U6GS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great 1080 TV. At 37\" you need a 1080, with 32\" or less 720 is fine unless you are sitting closer than 4 feet. So if you are wondering if you should save a few bucks and go with 720p instead, 37\" is the crossover point where 1080p is much better choice because you will see the difference at average viewing distances. Also, at 37\" or larger you really need to start investing in blu-ray DVD's since at this size regular DVD's don't view sharply - blu-ray is a 1080 format, regular DVD's are not.Picture quality is excellent from my Comcast HD cablebox and I have not had any problems with ghosting because it is only 60Hz - my preference is to use the 'Cinema' setting with a few slight adjustments. Sound quality is acceptable but not special partly because the speakers are not in front and don't point towards the viewer which is the case with most modern sets but some Samsungs TV's do have speakers in front. This mean sound quality will never be great unless you hook it to receiver. I have a simple two speaker set up in my living room but there is only one audio output jack on the TV and it is for an optical cable. So my less than one year old receiver which only uses analog cables just became obsolete. The remote is good with useful `Format' button. This button is important to quickly adjust the ratio as needed. I almost bought a less expensive Vizio from Walmart but learned that the `format' option is buried in the Menu and requires 7 steps to get in and out - not worth the aggravation. Lastly, the set does take a full 4-5 seconds to turn On. I am not sure if that is typical of all these modern flat TV's but it is with this one, not a big deal but worth mentioning.FWIW, I bought this at Sears because my old set died and I needed something quick. At Sears I was trying to decide between this and a 37\" LG, both the same price. Anyway the senior sales guy said both were very good but he would give the edge to Panasonic.I highly recommend this set and Amazon seems to have one of the best prices before taxes, which makes it even better if you are not in a rush and can order online to save another $40 or so on local sales tax.Edited/Updated: I switched my comcast box from the five cables to HDMI and the sound/volume is almost 2x as loud. I used to need volume between 40 and 50 and now 20 is fine. Picture quality still gets very high marks", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sound problems", "Author": "Shades 73", "ReviewID": "R4I7FOQPYJEF1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product arrived on time and a nice guy delivered it and told me not to open it yet because it was a bit cold out and if you plug something like this in when it's cold, it could fry it. So I waited a few hours until I believed it had reached room temp. and set it up quite easily. The stand was easy to assemble as opposed to some of the Samsung reviews, which is why I didn't buy a Samsung. The ease of use was great and it has a very nice picture. The bad thing about it is that the sound has problems....it warbles and echoes and it is sporadic and will quit if you turn off the TV. So, in the first week I had it, I had to call Panasonic. The guy I spoke to told me that it must be my cable box because the speakers are so simple that they couldn't possibly be the problem. So, he told me to unplug my cable box for a while and then plug it back in. Well, that didn't fix it. A couple of weeks later I got a call from Panasonic saying that they had a record of my call and that indeed, there is a problem with the TV when connected via an HDMI cable and they were going to send me some firmware to fix the problem. Several weeks later they sent me two SD cards with the supposed fix. When I put the first card in, it could not read the file. So, I called them again and after waiting a half hour on hold, I finally got through to someone who said that the file didn't have what I needed and that they would send me another set of SD cards. That was yesterday....I bought the TV on April 29, 2010 and this is June 21, 2010. Needless to say, I probably won't be buying another Panasonic any time soon.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent flat panel for the money", "Author": "J.

While comparing these two HDTVs in the store I was able to adjust the Panasonic to look as good as the Bravia. However, there were some minor graphic details missing from the Panasonic. For example a gray grid highlighting a baseball score on the Sony did not appear on the Panasonic TC-L37U22.Remote is easy to use and well built. There are controls on the right side of the TV for menu/volume/channel/input. The buttons aren't lighted.The progressive scan does an adequate job in displaying cable channels. It really shines on HD channels.The sound from the built in speakers won't blow you away. For the best sound, it should be hooked into a home theater system.Although the unit has an IPS panel (known for slower response times). While viewing regular sports I have yet to experience ghosting or blurring.

GO PANASONIC", "Author": "Beau", "ReviewID": "RLGOGAL2PX8P0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just want to start by saying Amazon was GREAT as always. The TV showed up on time and in perfect condition. Panasonic has one of the lowest failure rates in the industry. Unlike \"Samsung\", that according to \"Consumer Reports\", averages 30,000 defective TV's per 1,000,000 sold. They sell about 35,000,000 units per year, that equals 1,050,000 \"DEFECTIVE\" units per year. I purchased the Samsung LNT4065F in 2007 and had to have the capacitors replaced and had the panel replaced \"FOUR TIMES!!!\". From their products to their customer service it is obvious Samsung only cares about one thing, \"PROFIT\".After doing a lot of research I found out that Panasonic makes reliable pruducts. They're a Japanese company but the TV's are built in America. Panasonic LCD's don't have as many bells and whistles as other high end LCD's. What they do have is SOLID picture quality and a HIGHT QUALITY build. I've read other reviews on the Panasonic TC-L37U22 where people say the sound quality isn't so good. It's not true, the sound quality is very good in my experience. You have to do some tweaking to get the picture right, but once you do it is spectacular. Good blacks, rich accurate colors, and clear sharp images. The only area this TV has a problem with is diagonal lines on game graphics. I have it connected to my XBOX 360 Elite via HDMI cable and the overall picture is stunning, accept for diagonal lines. Diagonal lines look very jagged or have \"jaggies\" even in 1080P resolution. I did a lot of research into this problem and it turns out about 80% of all LCD TV's have a problem rendering diagonal lines accurately. It has to do with the chip set responsible for the video processing. It doesn't seem to effect TV and movie images, just computer or game graphics. I hate to say this but I found through my research and personal experience. The two LCD TV companies with the best video processing for reducing \"jaggies\" in diagonal lines are Toshiba (just their high end model) and Samsung. They actually have a calibration test for \"jaggies\" and even Sony's highest end LCD TV's don't pass it. This problem won't effect you if you don't play a lot of video games, or when you do, are sensitive to \"jaggies\". For watching HD TV and Movies on a high quality, RELIABLE set with great value... the Panasonic TC-L37U22 is a wise choice. Check it out for yourself, Panasonic LCD's and plasma's are some of the best selling TV's on Amazon.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "A TV that is worth a look!", "Author": "G. Opas", "ReviewID": "R2MQ2MZP7F2F22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this 37\" TV on a lightning deal and am glad I did. Well worth the 4 bills I paid.The TV came well-packaged and the unit arrived undamaged. Not even a crease in the box. There was peel-off plastic protecting the bezel and base and the screen was wrapped in a foam bag.The base was simple to hook up to the TV. Just have a philips head screwdriver handy.The colors are vibrant. It took a bit of adjusting to get the colors right, as the skin-tones were too red, out of the box. A bit of fiddling corrected that. I beleive that some of the reviews here give settings that worked for them. I just did it on my own.People talk about the slower response time for IPS panels and the benefits of 120 hz TV's over 60 hz TV's. All I can say is that I watch sports without any ghosting or blurring. I don't have any games hooked up to this TV, so I can't comment on that.The sound is very acceptable to me. There are adjustments for surround sound and for increasing the bass and treble. One always has the option to hook it up to a stereo or a sound bar, but I don't think I need to do that, as I am not going for the \"theater\" experience.The remote is very, very solid and well laid-out. It feels very good in my hand. I had no problem programming the TV into my FIOS remote, though I still use the Panasonic remote for some functions, such as selecting the input. By the way, you can label the inputs when in the menu, so you don't have to remember which input is for which device.Be prepared to wait about 5 seconds for the picture to come on after turning on the set. If that's not fast enough for you, think about what the rush is that you need gratification in less time than that.It boggles the mind why so many companies do not put a headphone jacks on TV's any more. It's not like it would raise the cost so much! I would have liked to see one on this TV.Overall, I'm very glad I bought this set and anticipate it being around for a long time to come.

I have had to call them with a couple of questions and after being on hold for more than 20 minutes I never really got my questions answered.

Images are clear and crisp, colors bright, no flicker, no dead pixels.Pro2: Amazon customer service was great. When I had a problem with the advertised spec being inaccurate, they immediately volunteered to take the product back OR provide what was needed to make the products work - free. It's hard to get better than this.Con: Specs on Amazon and Panasonic websites are incomplete. Both say 1080p, and they are - as long as you hook them up according to the manual, which is also incomplete. In detail... Because the packaging says \"1080p\" everywhere without reservation, I was surprised when they wouldn't go higher than 1360x788 when hooked to a PC. There was no obvious problem in the specs on Amazon's webpage or on the Panasonic website. On calling Panasonic, they informed me that if I read page 44 of the manual that I would see that 1080p is only available when connected HDMI-to-HDMI. Further, they claimed that all Viera TVs were like this and had been for some time. Then, they asked why I'd use a VGA cable to run this resolution because it was analog and wouldn't do it. (Needless to say, I called them on this by pointing out that I had a number of Acer, HP, and other monitors running 1900x1200 connected by VGA working without a problem.) They then claimed that a DVI-to-HDMI cable wouldn't work either and that I'd need to buy a new video card and new cables using only HDMI connections because that's what the manual said.I advised Amazon of the discrepancy between the advertised spec and actual performance. Without hesitation, Amazon immediately offered to provide an HDMI video card - free. We discussed it a bit further and agreed to try a DVI-to-HDMI cable first, which they also provided - free. (They did ask that I pay shipping. As I'd have bought the cables AND paid shipping if I'd needed these, I was happy.) Contrary to Panasonic support's statement, the cables worked and the TVs now run at 1080p.Conclusion: These are great TVs, especially for the price. Amazon's support is first-rate. Panasonic's support and attention to detail is lackluster and uninformed at best. (They should know their own product.) If you buy these TVs and aren't hooking them up using only HDMI, be aware of the potential resolution problem and don't believe anything from Panasonic.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic TV", "Author": "Matthew T.

Shipping was fast, 2 days with the Free Super Saver! Hey, I'm not complaining. After opening the box and setting it up, I thought to myself \"Man this really looks great!\" After picking up a new HD box from Comcast, I started to compare the plasma to the LCD. With a little tweaking I was able to get the LCD to look just as good. Now I did notice several things that are different. 1. The color seems to change, go darker and wash out a little when the viewing angle increases. Not a big deal, because my bed room is very small and I will be right in front of it, sleeping no doubt. 2. The sound is not as loud, but I was still able to turn up the volume, so it's not that big of a deal. The bass is suitable and sounds good when watching movies, etc. 3.

However, I was rather disappointed with it.First, the video/audio quality is not what one would expect from a modern 37 in LCD TV.  For example, I could clearly see 'ghosting\" in the first action movie that I put in the DVD (connected via HDMI, of course). On a side note, I was much more pleased after watching the same scene on the LG tv (37in, 60hz, 4ms) which replaced this set.Second, the Panasonic was not able to display the input from my PC correctly - the image was blurry and stretched out no matter what settings I tried (no such issue with the LG mentioned above).Finally, this TV broke on the first day.

Amazon did price match. Also have a Panny plasma and Samsung LCD 1080 for comparison. Very little if any color wash out from different viewing angles. Go look, compare the picture at Sears..see if you notice improved color accuracy over the other floor models, my wife and I did. I know we all have different tastes. Sure, there now are cheaper TFTs even LED backlit, lesser brand sets with thinner bezels, marginally better built-in speaker audio (downward on this model, works ok mounted on a reflective wall) and perfect scaling but this is Panasonic and my bet is it will outlast the lesser known brands. Standard def and 480 digital is poor on all the sets we have, the QAM tuner pulls non cablebox cable broadcasted 720p & 1080p formats and OTA just fine and looks great. Picture was a bit dark out of the box but so was the Panny Plasma, little backlight/brightness tweaking brought some pop. Going Plug N Play HDMI 1.4 from a video card HDCP handshake no problem, set was detected just fine. It does not scale perfectly in PNP clone mode, neither does the plasma, but some video card software will correct this, and about an inch perimeter cut off does not bother me since this is not used primarily as a monitor. Currently, there was not much info on AVS about controller lag, ghosting or a general review of this 37\" or the 32\" U models. No perceivable ghosting or lag sitting about 5 feet away so while I won't say this is perfect for gaming, it looked fine to my eyes (for those wondering). In fact I was pleasantly surprised how good BF BC2 looked. Streaming HD content also looks fantastic. Very satisfied after taking the leap on this set, YMMV.Pros: IPS color accuracy at 37\"!, viewing angle, price, Panasonic long-term quality, nice compromise between 32\" and 42\" sets.Cons: PNP Scaling (through PC video card HDMI/DVI will cut the edges a bit), full size bezel, speakers down firing.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Screen flickering/dim light after 3 months use", "Author": "Raj", "ReviewID": "R26E4C94YRT5HU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First 2 months the TV worked fine. 3rd month started screen flickering / dim light.

Heatherly", "ReviewID": "R1JSOUISUY7ABZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was one of several HDTVs included in an AMEX reward points promotion.  After comparing the features and technical specs on the various units available, this seemed to be the best value by a long shot -- plus it was one of the few 37\" models (32\" was smaller than I wanted, and 40+\" was too large for the room).  I'm very pleased with my decision.Set-up was fast and easy.  The instruction manual is clearly written, and there were no problems.My primary use is for watching TV and movies.  I live in an area not served by cable, so I rely on the built-in tuner for broadcast television, and on the PC connection to watch programs that are available on-line.  The tuner performs much better than the signal converter boxes I had, and the HD stations are amazing.  (Two stations have a tendency to pixelate around sunset or when the weather is stormy, but that happened with the converter box, too.  Most of the time, the picture is terrific.)  DVDs are everything you'd expect.  I have a sound system, so I'm not using the unit's speakers (I'd agree with other reviewers that they provide adequate sound, but are not impressive).I only have two complaints so far.  The first is the remote.  The keys are large and logically designed, but are not lighted and do not glow -- so using any function I haven't memorized requires turning on more lights and finding reading glasses.  A remote with keys that are lighted or glow would be a great improvement.  (Also, the channel up/down key is a little stubborn -- I hope this isn't a problem later.)My second complaint is the high-gloss black case -- but almost every manufacturer seems to use that, and I don't understand why.  It reflects sunlight all around the outside of the screen in the daytime (which can be very distracting in a room with windows).Bottom line, this looked to be a better value than comparable units, and so far it has been.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "JKLO", "ReviewID": "R39QK1FRDD48BP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this on a lightning deal on Amazon for $399.

After a few years of use, I was moving and dropped it down a flight of NON carpeted stairs. It still worked perfectly!! Ever since then I swore by their products.This review is regarding my first impressions of this new TV. I will update it in a few months.Packaging was excellent and the included stand is rugged. It doesn't just screw on. You have to fit it with a special bracket and then attach it to the TV. When you first turn it on, you do the initial setup and your ready to go. I am using this with an indoor antenna (I just got rid of the ridiculous cable company once and for all) and after scanning the channels, I was finished.I have other flat screen TV's and know from experience that the initial picture quality is FAR inferior to what you can really get. This TV is no exception. By default, the TV goes to \"standard\" mode which all controls (brightness, color, tint, etc.) are all neutral and must be tweaked for a better picture.PLEASE NOTE: Do yourself a favor and purchase a calibration DVD. Many people try and adjust the controls by \"eye\"; and they may get close but you don't realize how much better your picture can be when properly calibrated. These DVD's have a special filter you look through to get everything just right. They are so precise that they have you adjust the brightness, then the tint and then GO BACK to brightness to re-adjust and then back to contrast. Same thing with color. You adjust the color and then the tint and then back to color. That's because those items work hand in hand and MUST be re-configured a few times. It is impossible for you to \"wing it\" with just your eye. When you use just your eye, you may think the picture is good, but you will be amazed at the picture when properly calibrated. Stores generally have the brightness turned way up to enhance the picture; and most people have their brightness up too high also. When I calibrated my first HDTV, I was amazed at how far down they had me turn down the brightness. But it worked.Once calibrated properly, your done and the picture will jump off the screen. I guarantee it. The one I use is Digital Video Essentials. They have one for standard definition and HD. No matter which calibration DVD you get...GET ONE, I can't stress this enough.I like the features this TV has. One thing I particularly like is that you can manually add channels, even if your TV did not scan them in (roof antenna). This is useful if you have a rotator on your roof antenna. When you rotate the antenna, you won't have to constantly re-scan for channels.Other features I like are: 3 HDMI ports, backlight, Vierra Link, and channel surfing with Favorites. My 61\" JVC will only allow you to set favorites and when choosing them you bring up the favorites list and then choose the corresponding # for the channel you want. By that time, I could have just inputted the channel # myself. With this TV you can set channel surf to \"All\" or \"Favorites\". So then it will just surf your favorites when you hit the channel button. Nice.Another feature that I really like is the format setting. On other TV's, when you have a 4:3 picture (480i) and you want to fill the screen, it distorts the picture too much. With this Panasonic, you can fill the screen with the \"Full\" mode, but it doesn't distort the picture. In fact, it looks ALMOST HD. I don't know how they do this, but they do.Some have said they didn't care for the looks of the TV. I don't understand this. What were they expecting? It has a glossy black bezel around the picture which most TV's have. The bezel will reflect room objects since it is glossy, but that's not a negative. Also others have complained about the sound quality. It is not bad, but it's not great either. The speakers are downward facing (which I don't understand why company's do this)which lends to \"just okay\" sound. I use this in the bedroom where it's not going to be loud anyway. BUT I don't feel the sound is as bad as some have reviewed.So far, I am very happy with this TV. Hopefully, when I update this review, it will still be all positive.
