{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good TV for the technologically challenged", "Author": "A. Young", "ReviewID": "REDNGIC5YY1FD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was in the market to replace the 15-inch Magnavox TV I'd had in my bedroom for six years (and at which I had to squint if I got more than a couple feet away from it). I knew I wanted a TV that was at least 24\", but I didn't want to break my wallet on it. I researched different brands and comparison-shopped online with Amazon, Best Buy, Sears, and Target, at long last settling on this Sharp 26\" LED TV. It was priced at just $229 when I bought it, so I figured it'd be hard to go wrong with a 1080p-capable, 26\", name-brand set. Here's a rundown of the features that were relevant to me in buying and what I thought of them out of the box:EASE OF USEI am no technophile. Too many different-colored cords and inputs and outputs and buttons and tiny jacks tax my poor brain easily to the point of tears (which are inevitably followed by Office Space-esque rage and threats of throwing electronics out the window). Ergo, I wanted a set that was easy to assemble and program. The initial setup on this TV was a breeze thanks to a step-by-step process that initiates as soon as you power up the set for the first time. I also bought this TV with the intention of mostly watching DVDs and streaming videos with a Roku player, and the very clearly labeled inputs and outputs made plugging in my components a simple, rage-free process.PICTUREThe best thing that this Sharp TV has going for it is that the picture is indeed true to the product name: Sharp. First, I hooked up my DVD player to the AV component inputs. The picture was clear, bright, and easily viewable from the other side of my bedroom (about 10' away), and the TV's simple-to-use menus made it easy for me to fool around with the contrast, brightness, and saturation settings as well as to try out the picture on preset options (for my purposes, the Movie setting looked the best). So far, so good. I then hooked up my Roku 2 XD Streaming Player 1080p with an HDMI cable. I should mention that this was my first personal experience using an HDMI hookup, which I opted for mainly because it cut down on the number of cords required to hook up the Roku. Still, I was not totally sure what to expect. After I connected the Roku and completed the initial setup, I began streaming... and it was like seeing Mecca or the great Sequoia for the first time. Just WOW. The HD on this set is absolutely brilliant. I had thought that the standard DVD quality was nice, but the HD was breathtaking.SOUNDThe reviews of the sound on this set were the one point that gave me pause before I bought it, but most lower-priced flatscreens have the \"tin can audio\" problem -- and again, for $229, I figured I was not going to do much better. Honestly, the sound is not great, but nor do I find it totally unlistenable. I played around with the sound settings and found that the quality was much improved by turning up the bass, switching to the Live preset, and enabling the Surround Sound setting; that gave the sound a fuller quality than the default settings. It's still not awesome, but it's not so bad that I regret my purchase. I also often watch TV with noise-reducing headphones, which definitely helps round out the sound, and I actually have some old monitor speakers that I may try out with the set as well -- they've enabled many a rockin' dance party to be had off my usually barely-audible laptop, so I'm betting they could do this TV a solid, too.*UPDATE* Shortly after I wrote this review, I purchased the Altec Lansing BXR1220 2.0 Speakers (my review is here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R207MEV7BLUH30/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm) and tried them out with this TV. What a difference! They even out and improve the sound considerably, and when I bought them, Amazon was selling them for just $11. They are nice and compact and don't take up much space at all, and since they can be powered by the USB outlet on the TV, they power off with the TV. Definitely worth the few bucks extra!OVERALLThis is a good set for the price: easy to set up, excellent picture, and sound that can be lived with if you're willing to adapt. For this technophobe's money, it was definitely worth buying!", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "EZ", "Author": "wanda", "ReviewID": "R21RVW611CHZQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "quick setup, used 1 hdmi cable. connected to directv and wired to internet. sound was a little tinny, but fixed that with nice audio menu. great bedroom tv.excellent picture, no issues there.i would recommend this tv.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Picture's great, sound is awful", "Author": "MamaKat", "ReviewID": "RAIC21ZFKCW2R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my bedroom.  The size and picture are great, but the sound is awful.  It sounds like it's coming from a tin can.  I have played with the audio menu and brought it from a score of 1 (out of 10) to a 2, but it is still terrible.  I will HAVE to purchase additional speakers.  When my husband is watching it I keep thinking he's listening to the answering machine.  That's what it sounds like.  Like a really bad/cheap audio recording.  Sports are the worst.  There's just no oomph to it, no fullness, just flat tinny sound.  I bought it because Sharp is as close to \"Made in America\" as you can get and that is important to me.

They initially said someone would come out to check the unit then called back to say we'd have to bring it back in (which is why we just returned it).Overall, the picture looks great on HDMI (the reason for the 4 star review) - just be aware that you might get a bad unit too.

I would like to label each input with my own labels, such as Computer, Blu-Ray, and Cable.Great picture and sound is adequate with a few adjustments.I replaced a Dynex LCD TV with this one because the Dynex only had 2 HDMI inputs and the viewing angles were terrible, unless you were straight on, the picture was dark.

The picture is great and the size is just right as a bedroom tv or for that matter a kitchen/dining area tv.  The sound is at best BLAH!!!!!!!!!  It is tinny and shallow and no adjustments make it better.  What I did was I bought the Logitech usb laptop Z305 speaker and the sound is beautiful!  It is full bodied, clear and plenty loud. The speaker is powered by the usb port of the tv.  The only thing is that when the tv is powered on you have to power on the speaker by pressing the power button on the speaker.

The sound is not so bad if you adjust to \"Surround Sound\" and \"Live\" in the audio menu. Full bass is Ok but not necessary. Since I had an unused PC audio system with sub-wolfer that I could plug into the the headphone jack, the sound is now excellent. As for the picture, there is a a \"smart\" video adjustment that alters all signals to optimize the 26\" screen for all inputs. The full 1080, 120 screen was great for the super bowl.

I have it running from rabbit-ears in an area where cable is not an option.  Built-in tuner works as well as the old external digital tuner box.  I hooked up my external computer speakers (powered, with small subwoofer) to get decent sound.  The built-in speakers are laughably bad.  Tinny is an appropriate adjective for the sound.  No low-range whatsoever, and not much high-end, either.  If you buy the TV, please plan on buying external computer speakers.  Plug into the earphone jack (standard 3.5mm plug), turn up the volume on your external speakers and you can then control volume from the TV remote.  Works fine for me.  Being 60Mh rather than 120, there is a slight blurriness on high-speed movement, but it is really not noticeable most of the time.  I am very happy with it, given the external speaker setup.  4 stars instead of 5 because of the poor built-in speakers.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "AV Kevin", "ReviewID": "R14TOXCU9A8A93", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to go with a little surround system and the weak audio was not a concern for me. The built in sound is pretty tinny but that's not unusual for a flat panel TV, especially in this size range. With a little tweaking the picture looks great. A lot of the differences that some may be seeing in picture quality has as much to do with the source as the TV. If you are on cable or satellite, the picture is compressed and you'll lose some of the resolution. Even the channel selection will have a lot to do with picture quality. I use Discovery channel as a reference because they have one of the best 1080 signals around. If you use this with an antenna for local TV, the picture will be even better since it's no longer compressed. My main complaint, and it's common for most manufacturers, is the bezel around the TV is glossy black and reflects any light near your viewing position. It can be distracting during dark scenes. If you're concerned with sound quality, use a set of computer style speakers or even a home theater in a box. Anything will do a better job than most TV speakers anyway. I do wish it had more component inputs and an analog audio out. I turned off the internal speakers and set the volume around 50%, then fed the headphone output into my surround system. That way when I'm not using the cable box, I can still get audio into the surround system. As for the component input, they are basically outdated now and with 3 HDMI inputs, this TV should be more than sufficient for a while.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Phyllis L.

Might be that I'm trying to run two TV's off that box.The menu options are easy to navigate and the remote is nice, not like some of these real cheap crap TV's.For the price the TV is okay, nothing to really brag about, but it will work.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sharp but not cutting edge", "Author": "Wesley H.

The 9:16 aspect ratio covers less area than the Sony's 3:4 CRT.The 5w speakers are too underpowered for action movie audio sound effects. The picture colors are washed-out.

But, today a lot of people use USB drives instead of DVD's to play movies to reduce the wear on the DVD.  This particular tv only plays MPEG format movies.  This means for 95% of the shows you would like to watch, you would have to convert them from AVI or whatever the format.  This gets annoying quickly.  So 5 stars if you are just looking for a screen and 2 stars if you are looking to utilizes the USB for anything other than pictures (yes you can display pictures).", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good picture....bad sound....", "Author": "nhu", "ReviewID": "R17VDU3C1BYI4F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worked out of the box, easy to set up but the sound is really poor.

In general this TV looks and works good  except for the sound. At maximum volume it is almost impossible to hear  what is going on the TV.

Ghali", "ReviewID": "R3KK49E31ZO1C7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not a bad looking display, and it was an easy job to set up. All worked fine using it with my XBox until I tried Netflix. I'd get black screen dropouts, the Netflix app would suddenly close, or claim I was signed out of XBL. Or the TV would claim \"No signal!\" or \"Unsupported\". Looking online, it seems like this happens to lots of folks. I also had the same intermittent problems watching TV via Windows Media Center on the XBox.I ended up returning this TV because of these constant HDCP hiccups. Sometimes it would recover by itself in a few seconds. Sometimes selecting another input source and going back fixed it. Sometimes I needed to power cycle the TV, and sometimes I needed to power cycle both the TV and XBox.The best part of this whole experience is that because I spent time researching the problem and trying many different solutions (new cables, software/firmware updates, even swapping out the XBox for a different hardware rev) I went over Amazon's 30-day return window by less than 24 hours. Now they refuse to take it back and give me a refund. Be careful! If you start to see problems, send it back ASAP! Amazon is pretty ruthless with their return window. This is the last time I'll try fixing a purchase instead of sending it back immediately.This TV is a great deal for a 26\", ONLY if you don't require HDCP. For any HDMI source (or DVI requiring HDCP) you should definitely find a different display.I bought this one to replace a Samsung that had a less annoying HDCP bug, so probably avoid Samsung as well as Sharp. The replacement for this Sharp is a Panasonic Viera TC-L32U3 32-Inch 1080p LCD (ASIN: B004M8SC92). It has an IPS lcd panel which looks a million times better, is bigger, and was only about $50 more. No HDCP problems with it so far at all. Unfortunately, it looks like Amazon stopped selling this model. The other 32\" Panasonic available is only 720p, so be careful!UPDATE: 2 months on the Panasonic, and not a single problem. And it's a gorgeous looking picture!
