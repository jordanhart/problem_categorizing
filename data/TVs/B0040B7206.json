This one works perfect for that.  The picture quality on the screen is terrific out of the box.  My laptop also has blu-ray.  It looks terrific as well.  The only issue that I had was with the initial setup.  When I plugged in the HDMI at first, the picture quality was awful.  I tried installing the driver, didn't fix the problem.  I called Samsung and the very rude support person that I spoke with told me that the monitor is not meant to be used with a HDMI connection and to use the traditional cable.  The traditional cable worked ok, but I wanted to use the HDMI.  I argued with her for a while before searching out a solution on my own.  All that I had to do was click on 'source', click on 'HDMI 2', and rename it to 'PC'.  Then instantly my connection was perfect.  I did not have to adjust any other settings.  Thanks for nothing Samsung tech support!The extra real estate on the big screen is awesome.  I do a lot of excel and it really helps.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "A one piece  solution for two needs", "Author": "satherapist", "ReviewID": "R33X6JZ1Z3HL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung B2330HD 23-Inch LCD TVAfter three years, the monitor that came with my Gateway computer crashed and burned. I had wanted an HDTV for my bedroom where my computer is located for some time, but to avoid an extra expense, I would download a night of TV from the internet to play through my monitor or watch my large Samsung in my living room.I knew about the HDTV/monitor combinations but didn't know about the quality of the two functions combined.  I found what I wanted, then read many reviews.  Worked out fine since I live in a small town and was unable to audition many components.Worked right out of the box. Both TV and monitor were set-up and in use within an hour. Since I don't have access to cable, I use an amplified Phillips indoor antenna on both TV's, receiving all broadcast channels available in HD , about twenty-six of them.I'm not technically oriented so I can just say that both the TV and monitor do exactly what I bought them for and I'm very pleased with with the simplicity of set-up and performance.I would recommend this unit to anyone, without reservation.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV and Monitor", "Author": "wetduck", "ReviewID": "R3AP2NTQJ2XN11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall, I am happy with this TV. The picture in picture is cool. The size of the TV image when using PIP is kind of small though, not sure if you can change this. When I first used the HDMI from my computer the text looked really bad, but there is a fix. Hit the source button on the remote, then select the HDMI port, then hit the tools button. Then change the mode to PC. This will make the text look crystal clear. The speakers are ok, but not amazing. For my bedroom the volume is acceptable. You can play movies from a USB drive. The menus to navigate through the pics, movies, and music are fairly user friendly. It has a good range of supported movie formats. The buttons on the front of the TV are touch-sensitive. The channel guide has a timer so it will auto-tune to shows you select from the guide. This is my 2nd TV from this company. This is a good TV and for the price it's a great choice.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great monitor", "Author": "A.

While the difference in SD was slight, HD was very noticeable!Low and behold, the Vizio excelled in the picture quality department. Samsung is one of the most popular, if not the most popular LCD TV manufacture (notice I didn't say LED TV), but to my surprise Vizio outperformed in the detail department.Facial detail is lacking. Graphics and text is outstanding, but take a look at the detail on peoples faces or anything closeup and it gives the 'clay faces' look. Almost like the video was 'rolled off' only under certain circumstances. Really hard to describe this, but it was very noticeable.I also have a 32\" Samsung (not a TN panel like this) and the above holds true there also. That was my second LCD set (I have and have DLP RPTV's as my main sets) and just thought it was something that was typical of LCD TV's until I made this side by side.Pros;1. 1080p panel, ideal for PC displays, but see below2. Able to store channel memories for both OTA & CATV channels without deleting a previous channel list Why can't all manufactures do this??3. Easy mode switch from 'Air' to 'Cable',4. Unlike their non Business line of smaller sets, this has separate composite and component inputs. You don't give up one for the other,5. Also unlike their 5000 regular TV series, this has no stupid, cost cutting 'adapter' cable dongle for the component/composite input, which is a huge source of problems (see the reviews of those sets here on Amazon),6. Extensive menu entries for video & audio including ISF calibration for video & equalizer for audio,7. Front mounted controls,8. Easy to assemble stand, but see below,9. Nice laid out remote (a cut above most in this size & price class),10. Earphone out (might power a 4 ohm pair of speakers, but not any 8 ohm pair),11. Fair audio. Not good, but not 'tinny' like some others,12. Separate video setting memories for each input.Cons,1. As stated, fine detail (facial for example) somewhat lacking in detail,2. Only one RF input. Two memories, one input; real brains here,3. Stand supposedly does tilt, but you would never know it,4. CCFL backlight uses slightly more power than LED driven backlight,5. Narrow vertical viewing angle (as all of these under 32\" sets have due to the use of cheaper TN panels).6. With Samsung, one has to run the contrast almost full to 'drive' the video for the best image. Very little room to increase it more. (Most by default are set to half or 3/4 way, not 95 out of a 100 setting),7. Using this as a PC monitor (like most sets that have tuners) usually takes some finesse depending on the O/S you are using and your video card & driver (but at least it's not a 720).", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Shaun J.
