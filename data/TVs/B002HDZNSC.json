{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best LCD tv available today!", "Author": "Bearcat", "ReviewID": "R26KF6WQISON8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To clarify I own this tv and am not just basing this review on time spent in a store browsing.  This tv has been hard to come by and the only place I could find that had it in stock was my local Best Buy with a Magnolia section.Design: Samsung is noted for their sleek design and this tv is no exception.  Samsung says it has a charcoal touch of color but I really didn't notice any color in the bezel.  It is black and goes to clear at the outer edge.  It sits on a metal stand with a clear neck holding the tv.  At the bottom middle of the tv below where it says Samsung is a blue light which can be turned off.  I noticed the light flickers ever so slightly when a command is sent from the remote you are using.  The tv is VERY slim.  Only 1.6\" at it's fattest point.  This is amazing considering this tv is a fully backlit LED unit with local dimming.  Truly amazing and a design that will have your friends jealous.Picture Quality:  This is the best looking LCD tv made today.  I have viewed many other LCD tv's including the Sony XBR8 and the Samsung A950 from last year and this one is the best looking I have seen.  From a picture quality perspective the XBR8 is closest but not quite up to par with the 8500.  Realistically if you had either of these sets in your house they would look spectacular.  The blacks on the 8500 are so dark it approaches the level of blacks in the best Plasma tv's.  In a dark room I could not tell where the tv screen ended and the bezel began because the screen was so dark.  The colors are superb and can be tweaked any number of ways to your liking.  I prefer the \"Natural\" mode for everyday use and the \"Movie\" mode for watching blu-ray movies.  The 240hz refresh is nice but the best thing is that you can independantly control Blue and Judder settings.  Cranking up the 240hz tends to produce what some call the \"soap opera\" effect but this can easily be eliminated by tweaking.  There is also a Game mode which I use when gaming on my PS3.One interesting thing I found out was that the Movie mode using the Warm 2 setting is pretty much spot on from a calibration perspective right out of the box.  I say that because I have a Spears & Munsil calibration blu-ray disc and when I ran the tv through the calibration process using Movie mode on Warm 2 I literally only had to tweak one setting by one or two points.  I could see many people just flipping back and forth between Natural and Movie modes, depending on what they are watching, and not bothering to calibrate the tv as it looks great pretty much out of the box.I also wanted to mention that standard def looks good on this tv.  It doesn't look nearly as good as HD but it is totally acceptable in my opinion.Sound: Having such a think profile I expected the sound to be horrible.  Surprisingly it was quite acceptable.  While I would recommend a surround sound system I never felt like the tv speakers were all that bad.  My wife has never mentioned anything and I have never been watching a tv show and thought, \"oh the sound stinks\".  I would say it's about average which is ok to me considering the tiny amount of space Samsung had to work with.  While audio-philes may not like the tv speakers/sound I think a lot of people would be totally fine with it.Viewing Angle:  I sit about 9' to 10' away from the screen and have not noticed any real issues with the viewing angle.  Of course no LED LCD will have a viewing angle as good as a plasma but unless you are sitting at an extreme angle you probably won't have to worry too much about this.  I think this is more of a personal preference...sure the best picture is right in the center of the screen but I don't think sitting to the right or left a few feet makes the picture dramatically different.  Maybe a video-phile would notice but my wife doesn't notice and has never said a thing.Reflection: Be aware that this is NOT a matte screen, it is a reflective screen.  If you have windows directly facing the tv then make sure you have curtains or blinds that can block out the light enough not to bother you.  I don't think it's anymore reflective than other Samsung tv's but coming from a matte screen prior to this it was a big change for me.Widgets: The tv comes with internet connectivity for Yahoo Widgets, You Tube, Twitter, USA Today Sports and several others.  You can either buy a Samsung USB wireless stick to connect the tv wirelessly to your network or you can plug an ethernet cable directly into the back of your tv.  I have an ethernet cable plugged directly into the back of it.  First things first, the widgets do not load fast.  I'm not sure why but even using a direct internet cable into the tv they still do not load fast.  No idea why but they are slooow.  Slow enough for me to be annoyed and not use them much.  It's odd because when I went to the You Tube widget and looked up a video it played quickly and was smooth.  Hopefully Samsung will have a software update to allow the widgets to load faster.  Right now I would say they are just a novelty.  If they can decrease the load times and add more apps such as Facebook, then I think this has potential.  But people are not buying this tv because of the widgets, they are buying it for the picture.Overall I think this is an excellent tv.  Is it expensive, yes.  Does it have the best picture of any LCD available, yes.  If you have the money this is a great tv.  I use a Harmony One remote and it works flawlessly with this tv.  PS3 games and blu-ray movies look incredible.  The only quibble I have with the tv is the screen reflectivity and that is more a result of my room setup than the tv itself.  Whether I'm watching HD football, playing a PS3 game, watching a blu-ray movie or watching The Office I have been blown away by the picture this tv can deliver.UPDATE:I wanted to clarify something that seems to be a bit confusing.  I refer to this tv as an LCD tv which it is.  Samsung refers to this as an LED tv.  Basically this tv uses an LCD panel (thus it is an LCD tv) but it uses LED backlighting (as opposed to typical CCFL backlighting).  Samsung marketing has had great success with the term \"LED tv\" but in reality it is still an LCD tv but with LED used for backlighting purposes.  Just wanted to make sure nobody is confused when Samsung refers to it as an LED tv and I am calling it LCD....in a way they are both right but this can be confusing for a consumer.I also wanted to comment that I have now had this tv for almost 5 months and it has performed wonderfully.  I did have an occurance of what some people had called \"Crop Circles\" but this was remedied with a firmware update so no issues since.  Overall I am still blown away on a daily basis by this tv.  Whether it's watching the super bowl, the olympics or Lost this tv has been spectacular.UPDATE 2 Aug 23, 2010:I am now approaching 11 months of ownership and I have not had a single problem with this tv.  Picture quality is as great as the first day I bought it.  I know this tv is hard to come by these days but it is worth your time and money if you find one for a good price.  I don't believe Samsung has a replacement for this set yet.  There are many 2010 model Samsungs that are LED edge lit but I do not believe there is a true LED backlit tv for 2010 yet which would be the true successor to the 8500.FINAL UPDATE Dec 14, 2010:Having now owned this tv for well over a year I can say it has been the best tv I have ever owned.  I have not had any problems with the tv at all.  It has handled HD broadcasts, PS3 game playing, Blu-Ray movies and everything else I can throw at it.  This will probably be my final update as this tv appears to be no longer available which is a shame but understandable as tv manufacturers always have to bring something new to the table every year.  In my opinion this is still the best tv on the market, even better than the new Samsungs which all appear to be edge-lit LED.  Of course I am a little biased!  To this day people still comment on how incredible the picture is, and this is coming from others who own HD tv's also.  This is about the only electronics product I have ever owned where I am not envious a year later when a new version comes out.  I would pit this tv against ANY other tv currently in the market.FINAL-FINAL UPDATE Aug 2, 2011:I am coming up on two years of ownership of this television and it is still performing great.  I have had one or two instances where the screen did something odd but it was fixed by turning the tv off and on again.  Nothing major.  I recently used the Amazon video on demand application on the tv again and it still works great.  Even after almost two years people who come over still comment on how great the picture looks on this tv.  If there are any left out there and you can afford it I would still recommend purchasing one as it is still one of the best tv's, if not the best, available today....of course I am a little biased too:-)", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Finally an LCD competes with the best Plasmas", "Author": "J. Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"", "ReviewID": "R17NAYQWLEQSU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The UN55b8500 is Samsung's current flagship model and is the successor to the LN55A950.Picture QualityA full LED backlit LCD offering a stunning 7 million:1 contrast seperates the B8500 from other LCDs by reaching deep into pitch black, formely only possible with plasmas.  Some LCDs turn off pixels to achieve inky blacks - ok for still pictures, but too slow to work with most video - basically a gimmick to inflate contrast numbers.  The B8500 however, masters the darkest blacks and brightest whites to produce a bold three dimensional effect or \"pop.\"  In a dark room, the b8500 outperforms every LCD on the market, shy of the coveted pioneer plasmas.  In a moderate to bright environment however, the B8500 absolutely dominates.The highly reflective screen can be annoying for those with unfortunately placed light sources or windows without blinds.  A matte screen, as on the LG 55LH90, might be a better fit for some, but a matte screen diffuses the light causing the entire screen to lose those desirable inky blacks.  I can't say one is better than the other, but for a TV that can produce such dark blacks, I think the glossy screen makes more sense.Motion handling is the best of any LCD I've seen thanks to seperate blur and judder adjustments and very few motion artifacts.  Blu ray discs will exhibit perfect cinema-like panning or, if you want, a more smooth and clear pan similar to a home video.  My verizon fios hd occasionally shows judder when there should a smooth flow of movement. The b8500 can help minimalize this, but it is not powerful enough to eliminate it and if set poorly, it can be made worse.After some quick, basic calibration colors are vivid and mostly accurate.  Noise and artifacts are very minimal on 720p and nonexistant on 1080p.  Haloing (i.e. white text on black background cause background to lighten near text) is only visible rarely unless viewing from greater than 30\u00b0 off center and increases in severity as viewing angle increases.  Viewing from greater than 30\u00b0 off center vertically or horizontally also causes a slight loss, contrast and color depth.  Viewing from greater than 50\u00b0 off causes a significant loss in contrast and color, creating a flat image and showing major haloing effects.  The ideal viewing range is within 15\u00b0 of center, though if centered vertically, image is barely degraded at all up to 30\u00b0 off center.  Ideal viewing distance is roughly 8 to 14 feet for 720p and 5 to 10 feet for 1080p, though don't take those numbers too seriously, you can obviously enjoy this tv from just about any distance.  At 4 feet or less though, the 46\" model is a better choice.Ease of UseThe preset picture modes are all quite good for those who aren't picky and just want to watch their tv and the b8500 does a decent job of assigning settings automatically based on the input.  Of course, high-end buyers are more likely to calibrate sources to their liking or hire a pro.  The tv will remember settings for dynamic, natural, standard and movie profiles for each source.  That gives you a lot more flexibility than only having one or two, but it is complicated by a confusing lockout of various settings depending on how the source is identified.  You can change the name of a source and find more or less settings available for adjustment, but how this works should be clearly documented.  Also, there is a little lag when navigating menus, making constant adjustments of the many, many, many settings somewhat slow and annoying.  The layout of the menus themselves and the amount of adjustments available is wonderful.  The remote control works using RF so you don't have to point the remote at the tv.  The remote is a little bulky, but offers all the buttons you'd want for operating the television easily.  The scroll wheel is inaccurate for navigating menus and only really works as a directional pad.DesignWhile, I prefer the touch of grey on some other samsungs, the small blue light on the bottom of the b8500 is stylish, attractive and best of all, can be turned off.  The bezel is attractive, thin, and highly glossy, but can be distracting when it picks up too many reflections.  The 1.6\" thick screen is amazing, but how often do you look at the side of your tv?  The 61 lb. weight without stand is quite light for a 55\" tv, but again how often will you move it?  It does seem to use fairly little power and creates much less heat than a plasma tv.  The swivel stand works well, also quite attractive with a brushed gunmetal finish.SoundI did not play around much with the sound as I use a 5.1 setup.  I assume most people purchasing this tv will use external speakers, but the internal ones sounded just fine for what they are.ComparisonsCompeting models include the LG 55LH90/55LHZ, Toshiba 670u, Pioneer 500m/600m, Samsung 52B750/55B650/58B860, Sony xbr8 and Panasonic V10.  My personal experience with display models showed the plasma screens to perform poorly in bright environments.  Given the open layout and 20' ceilings of my living room, plus my wife's preference for at least dim lighting, this ruled out plasmas.  The 58B860 in paricular lacked the light output to produce bright enough whites in all but a pitch black environment.  The 55LH90 seemed to be the closest competitor and much cheaper, with the xbr8 and 52B750 being close behind.  The LH90 however, seemed to produce too many motion artifacts, couldn't deliver quite as much \"pop,\" along with a slew of more minor negatives.Misc.Upgrading from a Syntax Olevia 37 hvs (matte screen LCD), this tv has truly blown me away.  While the perfect (OLED?) TV is still out of reach, the b8500 leaves little room for improvement.  Input lag, a major concern for video gamers, runs under a tolerable 40ms according to my Rock Band 2 manual calibration with game mode turned on.  With game mode off, the input lag increases to 140ms, which is easily noticeable.  If running through a receiver, try component -> component instead of component -> hdmi for least lag.  Game mode disables some processing but not the LED backlighting.  The picture with game mode on even using a component connection (1080p) is incredible, though in need of some anti-aliasing on occasion.  Turning off extra processing not disabled by game mode seems to have little effect on further decreasing lag, but I tend to turn them off.  Auto motion is disabled in game mode, so expect some minor blur/ghosting.The B8500 also has a ethernet port for connecting to the internet and your home network (including DLNA or Anynet).  A cd included with the tv helps you play media from your PC.  Widgets will automatically update to display weather, sports, news, etc., but are a little slow and less convenient than popping open a laptop.  Still, it's a good idea to plug in the tv to your router at least occasionally for firmware updates.ConclusionFor those in the market for a 55\" HDTV, the b8500 is the most versatile and polished product out there.  While a couple extremely high end plasmas beat out the b8500 in a dark room, no other LCD performs as well and the plasmas quickly lose out as you increase ambient light.  The attractive and practical design and feature rich menus complete this incredible package.  While the 55LH90 is easy to recommend to those focused on price vs. performance or in love with matte screens, the UN55B8500 is clearly a step up and would make a remarkable addition to any loving home.  Prices should come down as we head into the holiday season and onto the super bowl, however these seem to be selling as fast as they arrive for now.UPDATE:  After upgrading to firmware 1008, I experienced a sort of \"crop circles\" phenomenon caused by a malfunction in the smart LED backlighting.  If you search online, you'll find several reports as it is a very widespread problem.  I have posted a picture exhibiting the problem above.  It can be fixed easily by turning your tv off and on again, but may reappear occasionally.  I'm guessing it will be fixed by firmware update eventually, but no word from Samsung.  Regardless, I'm still very pleased with my purchase.  If the crop circles weren't so easy to fix, I'd probably be fairly upset with the problem.  However, it was subtle enough only to notice against a still, uniform and light background.2nd Update:  Crop circles have not returned yet.  I expect them to from time to time, but it seems more of a random thing than a problem that takes time to set in.  Forum posters seem to have received word from Samsung that this issue is resolved and they are starting to roll out firmware updates (for now just as usb sticks to those reporting the problem)As for calibration, I used Spears & Munsil High-Definition Benchmark Blu-ray Disc Edition [Blu-ray] to get my brightness, contrast and sharpness set properly.  I came up with very similar numbers to what I've seen others post.  Contrast 87, Brightness 47, Sharpness 30 (though i couldn't tell much difference fro 0 to 30).  Setting the color space requires pro equipment, so I looked online for some numbers and they seemed to work better than default.  Of course, it's a great idea to get your set calibrated by a pro because optimal color settings are not going to be the same between most b8500's.  I use dynamic profile for daytime, standard for game mode, natural for sports (and some other tv shows), and movie for everything else.", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "UN55B8500 / Samsung Dissatisfaction", "Author": "Fancy", "ReviewID": "R3R2MPQAF7AH2K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased a Samsung UN55B8500 March of '09 by December of '11 (less than 2-years) television abruptly lost picture (black screen) although the power-on lamp remain illuminated, television wouldn't turn off with remote while the clicking sound of an internal relay cycling could be heard - unit had to be unplugged to shutdown. Plugging the television back in and powering up with remote illuminated power lamp but picture would not return while continuous relay cycling could be heard. An internet search indicated the problem was being experienced by other owners.A help call to 1-800-Samsung went out resulting in a contact phone number being provided to the only local repair shop - shop was called, said they'd call back and never returned call. Internet search quickly revealed overwhelming negative consumer experiences with repair shop.A couple days later a second call to 1-800-Samsung was issued, requesting to speak to a Samsung service technician - denied. An electrical schematic (which should have been included with product purchase) request was then issued, which Samsung refused to provide.Conclusion - the Samsung UN55B8500 did not meet reliability expectations (21 months) but more importantly Samsung refused to provide adequate service support as well as pertinent information necessary in restoring the UN55B8500 to operability.As an owner of the UN55B8500 I can NOT recommend this product or any other products manufactured by Samsung due to substandard component quality and product support.FWIW: Pixilation around quickly moving objects could not be corrected utilizing picture adjustment options.Up-date, REPAIR information: Although two different technicians incorrectly diagnosed the MAIN board (main board has component HDMI etc. connects) as being bad it was fine, while the culprit was the POWER BOARD which sports the clicking relay and power capacitors, i.e. the board connected to the power cord. Industry Technicians indicate installation of under-rated capacitors are a common problem with LED/LCD circuits. Replaced Part (#BN44-00307A / made in Korea) power board which returned television to operability. Be careful some internet part providers are selling refurbished boards, get a NEW board and/or replace appropriate caps on bad board. Additionally, Samsung's part supplier did NOT have the required part in stock (imagine that?), while indicating up to a two week wait for part availability, they also refuse returns on ALL items sold - all part and parcel to the Samsung experience. FWIW: New POWER BOARD was purchased from PartStore.com 1-866-933-5552 which returned televison back to operability.You're welcome.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The one I've been waiting for", "Author": "susop", "ReviewID": "R1QY8CQ5U3B9EO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to echo Bearcat's rating as he is very thorough and accurate, but I want to throw my 2 cents in.  When coupled with Samsung's own super-slim wall mount, which is just a glorified cable hanging on two sturdy disks, the TV sits amazingly close to the wall.  Another neat feature that I found hard to believe--When watching movies from an external hard drive, the TV can read a large variety of video CODECs.  It can read MP4, AVI, WMV, and MPG files.  I'm not sure about the Audio support, but I haven't had any luck finding a movie file that I have that won't play right off an external USB hard drive.  The TV also has about 1GB of internal storage to keep files on.All the Widgits are slow, but they are sill usable with the exception of the Video-based widgets, which I find way too slow to load to be of any use. I'd rather power up my computer if I'm going to be doing any internet-based activities.Of course, I'd be remiss not to mention how amazed I am with the picture quality.  I'm upgrading from a 55\" CRT-based TV, and watching this TV, for me, is like watching TV for the first time.  The major selling point on this TV over Samsung's similar 55\" offerings is the local-dimming feature.  Many HDTV's I've seen over the years simply adjust the entire backlight to achieve deeper blacks and brighter whites, but they simply can't do both at the same time.  It is very distracting for me to watch the backlight on those TV's ratchet up and down while watching a scene with a varying brightness.  This is where the local dimming feature comes in.  This TV can do both brights and darks, at the same time!  I have waited for many years to find an TV that isn't distracting to watch.  My wait was over with the release of the Sony XBR8, but it wasn't as affordable as I'd like.  Once I saw the crisp visual quality of the Samsung 8000 series, and read of the local dimming feature of the 8500, I was sold on this TV and I ordered it without even sampling the picture.  I could not be happier.", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "The best of the bunch", "Author": "R. Whitelaw \"Rebel Broker\"", "ReviewID": "R3D1393ZAGPB1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a big screen for a while now. Years even. I had pretty much resolved that I was going to get the Sony XBR 8. It has local dimming and is nearly universally referred to as the best LCD unit out there. My problem was that I wanted something with some of the more modern connectivity and interactive bells and whistles. The Sony XBR 9 and 10 added some functions, but were inferior to the XBR 8.  Then came the Samsung 8500 series. Just like the XBR 8, it does not do edge lighting - but rather uses LED for lighting only in the areas that need it (local dimming - it REALLY gives you deep blacks). I got a chance to see the Sony XBR 8 and the Samsung 8500 side by side and while the Sony was good... the Samsung took the game to a whole new level.To give you an idea of my setup, I have DirecTV and a PS3 which I use to play my Blu-Ray, Netflix and DVD discs.The very first thing you will want to do when you hook up your set is connect it to the internet and check for updates. When the set was delivered, I jumped right in and start checking out the picture quality with DirecTV. As I went through channels, some in HD, I was starting to get worried. I was seeing some areas that seemed washed out and was noticing things that had me thinking that the set was not handling motion as well as I had seen in the showroom. However, once I checked for updates, found some, and installed them, everything was well. The issues I was noticing went away and the set performed flawlessly. Now any items I see are the result of the quality of the content.CONNECTING IT: Do NOT pay tons of money for HDMI cables. You can trust me on this. I bought one $99 cable a $45 cable and a $9.99 cable. I tested all three and there was absolutely no difference in picture quality. The bottom line is that the signal is digital... it is a string of ones and zeros. You either get a picture or you don't. I tested these cables for a week and was able to return the expensive ones. This is not like the old stereo speaker cables or component cables that used to connect your tape deck to your receiver or your receiver to your TV.  You could actually make an argument for expensive cables in those cases because it actually carried the signal. In this case, it just does not make a difference.The HD content on DirecTV looks amazing. The lower resolutions stuff is REALLY going to stand out as bad, but that is the result of the source.Netflix content surprised me. Now you can get Netflix content off a variety of boxes... so I cannot comment on all of them. However, I can tell you that with either an xbox 360 or a PS3, you are going to be pleasantly surprised by the quality this set gives you. The HD content on netflix is not quite as dazzling as your going to come to expect from HD, but it is amazing considering it is streaming material.The quality of Blu-Ray discs (I have so far only played Star Trek and 300, but they are STUNNING) on the PS 3 is top notch. If you have an upscaling DVD player (Which the PS 3 does) you will find that the DVDs will look better than you have ever seen them look before. I just sat down to watch 'V for Vendetta' on DVD and it looked amazing. The upscaling is definitely improving the experience and the Samsung is really making it look its best.Whatever you connect to the Samsung 8500 is going to look amazing.  However, don't count on them sounding amazing. The built in speakers are a bit problematic. They seem to be pointing towards the back of the unit.  As built in speaker go, I have heard much better. I am currently shopping for some external speakers. I suppose the good news here is that the unit has easy support for external speakers.The interface is also a bit of a pain. Not horrible, but a bit wonky and the menus seem to lag a bit behind input from the remote. The one ray of sunshine in this is that you will find that fine tuning the picture is relatively easy and straightforward. I was able to get a picture I was happy with after about 20 minutes of fiddling - without ever having to dig up the manual. Also, the presets are actually pretty good. I don't think you need to tweak the \"Movie\" setting at all if you are doing a Blu Ray or DVD night with the lights turned off and some popcorn in your lap.It integrates easily with a ton of things from iPods to iPhones and hard drives. It also supports widgets - but I have to admit I have not really jumped onto the bandwagon just yet.The delivery from Amazon came off without a hitch. The guys brought it in, set it up and let me do a quick inspection to make sure it was not damaged in any way.While the pricetag may seem a bit high, I think you will find that the price on Amazon is just about the best out there. I did quite a bit of shopping and found I was saving more than a few hundred dollars buying it on Amazon - it also helped that I had a ton of Amazon gift certificates at the ready! If you are on Amazon Prime, delivery is then free and once you do all the math, you are saving a whole lot of money.But, is it worth the extra grand to get this unit instead of the Sony XBR 8? No doubt in my mind. I have since gone back to the store and seen the Sony and can clearly see the contrast difference. The 8500 just blows everything else out of the water when it comes to reproducing those deep, rich blacks.

A GREAT deal .. and I would be totally satisfied if it were not for the fact a month earlier I purchased a UN55B8000 for ~$2400 and i like the less expensive one more.  I have them sitting, side by side, and the pictures on the 8000 are clearer, less noise(meaning less grainy) etc.  Now, that being said, there are differences where the 8500 is superior. But even at the great prices i got on both TV's, im saying,  not $1000 better ... some might say I have no taste, its possible ...  I drink Beer and whisky, not wine .. hahahahI would have to speculate, from my observation,  that the 8500 is more sensitive to cable signal fluctuations and \"noise\" than the 8000.

Leetham \"ViDeeOhPhiUhl\"", "ReviewID": "R1UN8M4HQ2M6WZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's get straight to the point.  This is the local dimming LED television we have all been waiting for.  It is the best television available today.  Yes, it's even better than the famed Pioneer Kuro 151.  I owned a Kuro 151 for over a year and I can tell you with 100% certainty that this television outperforms it in every regard.  The black level on this 8500 is literally twice as dark as the Pioneer Kuro.  The black level on this television is so dark, endless, and infinite that you can't even imagine it.  The black level is so dark that the entire television disappears if you are viewing it in a completely darkened room and the scene goes completely dim before switching to the next scene.  I'm not exaggerating.  You literally can't see the television at all anymore when the scene goes completely dim.  It's like the black of being in a completely pitch black cave.  I'm not sure it should even be called a black level on this television because it's not a level of black.  When I say that, I mean there is no possible way you could measure it.  It is legitimately pitch black.  It's as dark as you can possibly imagine.  If you want to have a little fun, go to CNET and read their review of the Sony XBR8.  In the review, they discuss how the XBR8 is capable of achieving a darker black level than the Kuro during certain scenes.  Now go and read their review for the 8500.  In the review, they discuss how the 8500 achieves a much darker level of black than the XBR8 and how the black level performance is vastly superior to the XBR8.  However they also try to say that the 8500 achieves the second darkest level of black -- after the Kuro -- they have ever seen.  Well, you can't talk about how the XBR8 can get darker than the Kuro, then discuss how the 8500 achieves a much darker black level than the XBR8, but then try to say that the 8500 has only the second darkest black level you've ever seen.  CNET, this makes you come across as hypocritical idiots.  It also clearly brings out your bias for plasma, especially Pioneer Plasma.  I owned the Kuro 151, and I am now the owner of the 8500.  If you compared the black level of these two televisions side by side, it wouldn't even be close.  A Plasma simply cannot go 100% literal black.  The individual plasma cells can go completely dim, but they still have an electric current flowing through them, and they still have to use a black filter to keep from showing the light of the current in them.  Plasma's are also using phosphors which will never be able to go completely dark.  The Pioneer Kuro can go very dark and achieves an amazing inky black, but a local dimming LED -- when done correctly -- can completely shut out every single bit of light to any given area of the panel.  This results in a black level that is so dark it cannot be measured.  It is the only way to achieve legitimate black.  Let's discuss a few other performance aspects of this television.  Words cannot describe the colors on this television.  The color accuracy is absolutely flawless.  Colar saturation is also superb.  The features are excellent, and only matched a few televisions available today.  The video processing and motion resolution are unmatched.  The 240Hz with LED motion plus resoloves all 1080 moving lines.  This is one of the only televisions ever made that can resolove all 1080 moving lines.  This television exhibits no blooming whatsoever.  The extreme contrast ratio makes the glossy screen a non issue.  The only way you will ever notice the glossy screen is if you are viewing a really dark film in a brightly sunlit room.  If you are viewing bright content such as sporting events in a room that is full of sunlight with a window directly facing the television, you would not see any reflection whatsoever.  The glossy screen and ultra clear panel also help this television preserve an identical level of black regardless of room lighting conditions.  I also own the XBR8 and while the matte screen is great for a room with a window facing the television, the matte screen does not allow the television to preserve that deep, dark, inky exact same level of black.  I certainly see some brightening of the black level in a non-darkened viewing enviroment with my XBR8.  It definitely still achieves a great level of black, but I just wanted to mention this for anybody who is considering matte vs. glossy.  With all of this said, I just want to close by once again stating that this television will not let you down in any way, shape, or form.  As my headline/title suggests, it is simply is simply the best.  I truly believe that this television will be used as a reference to compare all future televisions against for some time to come.  There's not going to be a television released that exceeds the performance of this television for a very long time.  We might see a 2010 plasma compare to this in a completely darkened enviroment, but plasma viewing will never be able to compete with this in a moderately dim to very bright enviroment.  Yes, plasma's -- the top of the line ones -- have came a long way as far as their anti-reflective screens and increased brightness, but the image displayed by even the very best plasma is still unacceptable in a bright room.  The black level still turns to grey, and the colors still wash out.  This is never going to change.  The technology inherent to the plasma image will never be able to present an image that excels in a bright room.  I love my giant 65 inch plasma in my 100% dark at all times theater room, but with this B8500 you truly get the best of both worlds.  The picture performance outshines even the best plasma in a completely darkened room and absolutely blows every other television out of the water in a bright room viewing enviroment. I hope this helps.  Thank you.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Best TV of 2009. Neat Amazon Video Features! Weak Speakers.", "Author": "P.

However, since the Samsung UN558500 is much more energy efficient, thinner, lighter, is 240 HZ, and includes two remotes, I'd say the Samsung UN55B8500 is probably a contender for the best TV ever made.The black levels are amazing! It's actually hard to tell where the black bars of a widescreen movie end and run into the bezel since the Samsung is so close to absolute black.On the other hand, I found that the speakers on the TV were pretty mediocre. This TV's picture quality is superb, but not the sound. You'll want to buy extra speakers of some sort.The 4 HDMI ports are nice to have, but there's only one component/RCA input (which will be taken by your Wii if you own one).  The TWO included remotes are great; One is small and simple, the other is an RF remote featuring a spinwheel among other controls.The other strong surprise is just how well the TV works with Amazon! Once you register your TV with Amazon (a slick 5 minute process online), then any movie you rent via the Amazon website will be available to watch on the TV set, and I discovered that sometimes when purchasing Blu Ray movies from Amazon, you can watch a free digital version of it on your TV while you wait for the mail to come! It works super well, you just browse Amazon as you normally would, and your purchased/rented movies automatically show up as available movies on your TV!Granted the Yahoo! widgets (including the one for Amazon VOD)  are pretty slow, but it's tolerable .Otherwise the TV is just great! Note that you'll want to upgrade your firmware when you first get the TV to avoid the \"crop circle\" problem, but once you do, your movies and TV shows are going to be even more fun because of the outstanding punch of the picture.

Although, I researched this product prior to purchase, apparently the problem doesn't show up until after a year or more.  Unfortunately, after one year went by, I started getting \"clicking\" noises, then the TV started turning itself on and off, as well as changing modes.  This continued, gradually getting worse and happening more often.  As of a couple of months ago, it won't even turn on.  If I plug it in, it just clicks over and over again.  I was lucky I still had my old Toshiba, with which I've never had any problem.  This week I spent some time on the internet trying to find out if anyone else had a similar problem.  I was shocked when I found approximately 50,000 hits on YouTube regarding what sounded like the same exact problem.  The videos were very detailed on how to fix the televisions and recommended changing capacitors.  Apparently, Samsung used capacitors (a $4 retail part) which did not have adequate voltage.  I called Samsung customer service today and asked them to fix my television, telling them how unhappy and disappointed I was.  I was told by the representative that my particular model of television (an LED) did not have the capacitor issue and that the capacitor issue had been resolved with other models.  I filed a formal complaint with Samsung but don't expect them to stand behind their product.  After all, I don't have the extended warranty and I guess it's ok to pay $3500 for an item that only lasts one year.  This is an expensive piece of junk.

Everything that every other review has said thus far is spot on in terms of picture quality and the robust customization options for finding the right settings for your home environment. Out of the box, the default settings on this TV make everything look \"hyper-real,\" or also referred to as the \"soap opera syndrome.\" It's amazing, if not creepy, at first, but most people will prefer to have a more cinematic experience. By making a couple of simple adjustments, you can tone down the hyper-real look and get a gorgeous picture with breath-taking clarity and color. CNET created an easy-to-follow guide for optimal settings on this TV and with only a couple of tweaks, I found their settings to be perfect.I personally don't have any complaints about the reflective screen, as my living room only has one window, but if your floor plan is different, just be warned. I have one ceiling fan/light combo in the middle of the room, but once the TV is on, you can't see it. Not even during dark scenes.For you gamers out there, note that I have a PS3, X360 and Wii all connected and everything looks fantastic! With 4 HDMI slots, there's plenty of room and with Samsung's \"Game Mode\" option, you will not be disappointed with the performance of even the most chaotic on-screen action of games.You hear lots of people compare the \"inky blacks\" of all TVs to Pioneer's Kuro Elite series, which I have no experience with, so I can't offer an opinion one way or the other. What I can tell you is that based on my experience with other CRTs, Plasmas and DLPs, these are the deepest blacks I've ever seen on a TV.In summary, I can't say enough positive things about this set. As with anything, there's bound to be some minor gripes from people just depending on their personal tastes, but I found myself to be completely satisfied with no desire to even consider another TV. The picture is so clear that a view out of the window next to it barely looks any different and that's scary. It's bright, colorful, user friendly for any skill level and overall the most happy I've ever been with a TV purchase.

Because this was my first serious HDTV, I wanted to make sure it was going to be a good one so I researched the heck out of the TV's out there and even went to CES amidst the 3D HDTV's, and rubbed shoulders with some of the dealers in attendance and asked about this model. Every dealer I spoke to thought this model was great and couldn't keep enough on hand but cautioned that Samsung was pulling the plug on its production supposedly due to some infringement on a patent. This was not an issue for me. As long as the picture quality was great, that's all I cared about.Out of the box this HDTV had beautiful picture quality and hardly any adjustments had to be made. Quite honestly I haven't even tapped into any of the special functions of this set because I just have it hooked up to a PS3 and use it to watch Blu rays movies and maybe a sporting event on network TV every now and again.Things started getting tenuous about 15 months into owning this thing. The dreaded crop circles I had read about started to appear during football season last year. Thankfully these appearances would be remedied by turning off the set for a minute or so and then firing it up again. However, at the 27 month mark was the first time I encountered the set not turning on. Instead, I got a clicking noise that would not stop until I unplugged it. I did this a couple times in a span of 5-10 mins and on both occasions tried turning it on directly from the On/off button on the TV. I finally decided to give it a rest and read up and diagnose the problem. Thankfully the Amazon review by Fancy expressed the same problem as I was experiencing and pointed to the power board (BN44-00307A) being the culprit and gave accompanying resource to purchase the part from, PartStore.com. Basically a $250 plug n play part. Thankfully when I came back the TV was able to turn on again and has not displayed the problem since but in all honesty I'm just waiting for it to go out again forcing me to buy the part and hopefully resolve the problem.UPDATE: One week after writing this review the TV was not able to turn on at all. I ended up ordering a new power board through Partstore.com. Part number BN44-00307A. The cost was about $251 for a new board although they had refurbished boards which I didn't want to take a chance with. The repair is fairly simple and requires taking off the back of the TV which is held together by screws and the unscrewing and unplugging the cables from the power board. Please note to take care when unplugging the cables connected to the board by pulling from the plastic piece connected into the board and not by the wires. Also when putting the cables back into the board make sure the pins are aligned so you don't end up bending the pin on the replacement board.

I wouldn't have spent MSRP on it, but that has more to do with a cap on how much I will spend on a single electronics device rather than the quality of the set. Definitely worth it vs. many other LED TV's out there.The styling and depth of the panel make it shine above the competition and after calibration the set really shines.If you play games, you will have to use game mode as the picture processing adds about a 45ns delay to the picture over the audio. This can be tweaked with an AVR receiver but if you are playing a game that required precise movement you will notice the delay. However, in game mode everything works great and still looks great.It would be nice if there were more LED zones, but the set still performs fantastic. I don't find the glossy screen to be an issue at all... if anything I prefer it and this is coming from someone who swears by matte screens in regards to computer monitors. The glossy screen helps deepen the blacks and really makes the color pop. It is a mirror when the set is off or a black screen is displayed but the brightness of the backlighting is enough to wash it away in my setup during mid day.Lastly, I find the TV performs better during the day or with lights on. When I shut out all the lights, the blacks lose a bit of their absolute blackness and I can see some spill-over from the LED zones. This can be corrected by tweaking some settings for night view. I have read that in the maintenance menu you can enable day/night modes but I do not feel comfortable changing settings and possibly voiding my warranty not even two months out of the box.The online features are mostly gimmicky.. but then again I bought this set for the picture quality not the widgets.

I almost bought us a Panasonic Kuro plasma, based on expert opinions that the Kuro had the best picture.  While that may be true, the image quality of the 8500 is close to the Kuro, and every other quality is far superior.

It is as flush with the wall as our original paintings which surround it.

I would be the first person to complain if the sound from the TV was not good enough for television viewing.  Movie sound is okay too, but I really should connect something to fill it out.  My point here is to let you know the sound is fine, not something to complain about.The only thing I would have Samsung change is the glossiness of the frame.  This design would look better with a flat or satin finish.  The glossy viewing screen is not the problem.  It is just the surrounding frame that accentuates every little wave in the finish when reflecting light off-axis.  This is an obvious design flaw which a good design department should have stopped early in the process.  I am surprised Samsung allows this the get out the door.  It does not do justice to what is now inarguably one of the best consumer television sets made so far.Five stars for a magnificent product, and by the way, buying it through Amazon was the best way to go.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best LCD in the market", "Author": "Aman Gheewalla", "ReviewID": "R1SONZGC0ZX54G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Samsung UN55B8500 since back in November and I did a LOT of research on LCD's before purchasing it.

I am a little concerned after reading the owner's manual that the set is more susceptible to burn in images than I expected; nothing in the sales literature about that.  The risk increases greatly with viewing stationary images such as pictures without a slide show; also if you do not have the picture expanded to full screen, or if you have internet content such as stock prices that are static content.  I had thought that it was more like the LCD display on my laptop, which has not has any such problem in 4 years of use.  The problem is said to occur when such static images are viewed more than 5-15% of the time, not much different from plasma.What was really disappointing was the delivery service.  In fairness, I live on a somewhat remote island so it's not as simple as an urban delivery, but there is a bridge and I am only 2-1/2 hours from Norfolk, VA.  Truck services as well as UPS and FedEx are routine.  Nonetheless, it took almost 4 weeks to receive the TV, even though the initial journey from DFW to ORF only took a few days.  The set was not locatable with the tracking number because the carrier didn't scan it in on the receiving dock, a secondary carrier tried to rip off the originating carrier by claiming extra charges for a ferry to the island, even though the ferry loading dock was further away than my house via the bridge, and when it finally arrived, it was by two college students that didn't know a HDMI from a printer cable.  They did carry it up a set of steps to my living room, it did finally arrive intact, and I did get it setup on my own even though that was supposed to be part of the delivery service.This was not Amazon's fault, and when it went missing, their large appliance team found the set and refunded shipping charges, even though it was a free delivery.  Excellent customer service on their part, but if you live in a remote/rural area, be prepared for the unexpected.I would like to say that the speakers built-in are fine for what they are; I have seen previous reviews that mentioned that as a concern, but sound quality was more than just acceptable.  I still am going to use surround sound system, but if I didn't have a separate speaker system, I could live without it.On a final note, the manual is very well written and understandable; while it is going to be a little time consuming to tweak the system for your particular situation, it's not that hard to do.

I loved my UN55B8500, the TV just looked awesome. Then it happened, my TV would start turning off and come back on again. I refuse to believe that my top of the line Samsung was having any issue because it only happened once a week. Then it started to happen once everyday, then one day it just turned off and wouldn't come back on. I heard a clicking noise in the upper right hand column as if something was trying to start the TV again. I unplugged it and waited about and hour and plugged it back again, Shazam!! it started working again. This was happening every other day and I went through the whole ordeal every time until one day, after giving it 4-hours or more to reset itself it wouldn't come on. So I gave it a whole day and nothing. I called Samsung for tech support and explained the problem to them. They were clueless and then they told me I was out of warranty so I was SOL. That wasn't a problem though because I had an extended warranty through Amazon. (For the record this repair is a pain in the butt, because I had such bad luck. This would happen sporadically and the problem was unpredictable as it would only happen to me, not when the Repair man was there.) The first TV repair man was clueless as well, they replaced the main board after I specifically told them there was a clicking noise in the upper right hand corner. But when they installed the main board the TV worked so the repair man assumed it was fixed. After the repair man left the problem started happening again, So that repair didn't fix anything. I contacted my extended warranty again , but this time I called the Geek Squad so I can get a warranty on my repair. They replaced the power board and everything was fantastic for about 20 days. Then it started happening again but worst this time. It wouldn't even turn on after 5-days of unplugged status. What an ordeal this was, Samsung techs, TV Repair men and the Geek squad couldn't fix the problem. So then I started using the internet and found out the Samsung capacitor issues. This is exactly the symptoms I was having and this is not a little problem, there are a handful of youtube videos about the issue and on how to fix the issue (Please check it out). These capacitors cost less than $10 and from the videos, it explains the reason for the problem is Samsung used under power versions that affect a lot of models. Not just the UN55B8500. So now you know my experience with this model. If you decide to buy a Samsung TV you should really consider the extended warranty. From my experience I would just buy another brand until Samsung improves their reliability. Really Samsung? Cutting cost by using cheap capacitors? Then pretending to not know whats going on? (The issue is all over the Internet) If this TV cost only $25 then it wouldn't be a big problem, But I paid over $3000 for this model and I would expect it to run worry free for at least 10-Years. So for all of you reading this; Don't fall for the gadgets and picture quality. Look for dependable brands, do your research. $3000 is a lot of money (more than my mortgage) for a TV that works great for 1-year.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "BEWARE OF SAMSUNG TV'S", "Author": "onestopnyc", "ReviewID": "R1W62SHFU0RHY5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At first I loved the TV, but then, just 16 months later, it started acting up. Of course it was out of warranty so I had to get an authorized repair company to come (given to me by Samsung). They charged me over $500 to replace the main board and the touch control panels. Lasted a day then the tv was dead. The problem was that the TV would turn off out of the blue and a clicking noise could be heard for 20 minutes before the picture would come back. Now, there is no picture, the tv is dead and they have to come back to fix it. Looking in google, many people are having the same issues with samsung TV's because they are putting in 10V capacitor that bulge up when they are in fact getting 12V of power. This is a complete joke from samsung and I will never buy another TV from them, if you want to buy one of their TV, opt for an extended warranty or use your American Express card that will (in certain occasions) extend the warranty by another year (luckily I realized this and Amex is now paying back the $549 I paid for repairs).

There was no way to get rid of the light shining in from the corners of the screen and the backlight uniformity was terrible on dark scenes. I tried to like it because I did not want to spend nearly twice as much on the 8500 but I could not get past the search light effect in the corners. I returned that one and purchased this TV and I am very glad I did. There is no comparison between an edge lit LED and this one with the local dimming back lit LED's. In the brightly lit stores, you can not appreciate this feature like you will in your dark living room. The black bars on the top and bottom when watching a movie with a ratio that does not fill the screen, are black, not grey. You will not see any light shining in from the corners. Also, the dynamic contrast feature of the 7000 series would make the screen lighter and darker during the movie depending on the light of the scene. That was very annoying. With the local dimming LED, this is not a problem. The picture is also noticeably better with all video sources whether HD or standard definition and I am using the same cables with this TV as I did on the 7000. I have the blur reduction set on 10 and the judder set on 2 for the best looking picture I have ever seen on a TV. I have Dish HD and the HD channels look amazing on this TV. Even the  standard definition channels look very good. There is a very noticeable improvement on picture quality over my last LCD TV and the 7000 that I returned. Every time I watch this TV, I feel that it was well worth the price I paid for it. If you are looking for the best picture you can possibly get from a TV, LCD or plazma in my opinion, this is the one to get.

Around 6 months after getting the TV I started to see white halos on the screen (see [...] [...], or just search the internet for Samsung halos, crop circles, white dots, etc.).  I called up Samsung about the issue and they told me to try their \"picture test\" (it is just a picture which is saved on the TV's memory and is not sent through the video processor to the display, so the halos disappear).  When the circles did not show up in their test they say it is not their issue, and it is your cable or satellite service.The real problem is their motherboard, but they won't admit it until you are outside of their 1 year warranty period (it is not just this line of their TVs just so you know).  Now comes 2011 and the motherboard is deteriorating rapidly.  The issue with the motherboard is now causing the TV to randomly switch modes (HMDI, PC, TV), so you have to pick up the remote and change it back to the right mode, but now you have missed part of the show you were watching, and it keeps doing this every 15 - 30 minutes.  Give it a couple of days and the capacitor (part of the power supply) starts acting up and the TV starts making a clicking sound ([...]  Next, the television sets starts to turn on and off randomly.  Sometimes it completely shuts down, sometime the screen goes black but the power button on the bottom of the TV stays on (blue).  Sometimes 5 seconds after turning off, the TV will automatically turn itself back on.  Sometimes 5 minutes later.  Sometimes never (not even with the remote control or buttons below the LCD panel).  Worse yet, when it doesn't completely shut down you can't kill the power on the TV unless you unplug it.  Finally, after all this the TV finally dies on you (the screen will display a message \"mode not supported\") and there is nothing you can do to get it to work.Now let's discuss their customer service.  As first mentioned, you will call during the warranty period and they will dismiss the problem.  You can keep calling and they will tell you the same thing over and over again.  Once you are out of the warranty period they will give you 3 options: 1) Pay a lot more for a newer model (their view of an exchange), 2) They will pay you what they consider to be the prorated value of your TV (at least 20% less than what you paid for it, since they only rate their TVs for 5 years), or 3) Wait months (they will tell you a couple of weeks) for the replacement parts that will never come.I chose option 3 as I wasn't going to pay more for another garbage product or take less money than I paid for it because they refused to address the issue during the warranty period when I called.  So I wait for the parts to come, and call to find out the status.  They tell me they have been ordered and they will let me know once they come in.  So I wait some more and call, and am told the parts have not been ordered as I am out of the warranty period.  I explain to them that the warranty was extended and the parts were supposed to be ordered weeks ago.  I go through the whole explanation all over again, and they agree and say the parts are now ordered.  Then I get a call from their local service rep saying the motherboard is in, but they won't install it until the capacitor is delivered.  The capacitor is made in Korea, and no one knows when it will be available (previously told it would only be a couple of weeks for both parts).  I call back customer service and they say just to wait.  So I wait, and call, and wait, and call, and wait.  Then I get a message from their \"Triage\" department saying the parts have NOT been ordered, and won't be ordered until I call them (a specific guy, but I won't mentioned the jerks name) back and he approves the order.  So I call the guy back, explain all the issues I have had, he agrees with the parts that were supposedly ordered over a month ago, and says he will now release the order on the replacement motherboard and capacitor.  He gives me the confirmation number, and tells me I will get an e-mail confirming all of this.  Since I can no longer trust a word Samsung says, I call the guy back the next day when I don't get an e-mail.  He proceeds to tell me the number I have is NOT the number he gave me (even though I repeated the number back to him twice and he concurred) and tells me what the \"right\" number is.  I stupidly think: okay, so he just wasn't paying attention to his screen and gave me the wrong number, but that the parts are ordered.  I get home that same night and there is another message from their local service rep stating that if I want to have someone come out to my house to take a look at my TV and diagnose the problem that I need to call them back and pay them $85 for the service call.  I call them up, tell them they already have the motherboard in their shop, they look up my file and say, \"oh yeah we are just waiting on the capacitor to come in\".  I call back Samsung the next day and ask what is going on.  I give them the new (\"right\") number the jerk gave me, and the tag in their computer says my TV is out of warranty.  I then ask Samsung what the status is on the \"wrong\" number and they tell me that that guys parts were ordered.  The story goes along the same line for months, when I finally call up Samsung and tell them my TV is dead, I am paying for TV service I can't use, and I want all the money I paid for the TV back.  They now will only offer me up 75% of the value I paid since it has now been longer than 1 year and 3 months (they deduct 5% of the value every 3 months) since I purchased the TV.  I told them to forget it and have filed a complaint with the BBB.  Maybe they will finally decide to do the right thing and give me a full refund, but I highly doubt it.I am passing along this story to anyone looking to buy electronics, as I have heard similar issues with other Samsung products from other people when I tell them what I have gone through.  Ultimately I want my money back, but if I prevent even one person from having to go through what I have gone through, then I can say I've done something good.  GOOD LUCK!One final note: in one of my many conversations with Samsung (this one with their \"Executive Customer Service\") I asked them how they come up with the arbitrary degradation value of 20% per year for their TVs.  The woman told me that they only warrant a portion of the TVs for 5 years, and my response was that my Sony lasted me almost 20, so shouldn't it be more like 5% - 10% per year.

For me, I turned this option off since I like a brighter picture. I did not notice much of a benefit to having it on.The remote is not that great since it is RF, which makes it difficult to program your remotes with the TV.

In response to the comment, this TV accepts IR signals but since the remote is RF. I apologize I was not clearer, so you cannot use the auto-find feature since it is not an IR remote to find the code, so you have to do it manually by entering the Samsung code.Also, the remote has a slider button, kind of like the old ipods to scroll through menus. I wish they would have had up, down, left, right arrows instead of this. It does allow you to push up, down, etc, but if you do not push straight up then the menu may not scroll as desired.It would have been nice if the TV would have inactivated unused ports.

It's simply one of the best local-dimming sets. But this panel does indeed have problems. When I researched this panel, I knew about the capacitor problem. I knew it was fixable in that case, so I pulled the trigger on this TV anyway. 4 years into this TV, I have not had any of the symptoms other reviewers have noted.. no capacitive touch glitches and no clicking... so I would give it 5 stars, but I want to temper that with the trouble that this set has caused for many people. It's a fantastic set, and since it's a late model, there is a good chance that those still buying them aren't leaving reviews unless something goes wrong. I'm not saying that IS the case, but if you are willing to take a little bit of risk, this TV is a very solid performer in the LCD market.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Outstanding TV", "Author": "J.

Guests rave about the picture quality all the time, even when they have newer, later-model televisions. Likewise, Comcast and DirecTV technicians have ooh'd and ahh'd about this television over the years, even though they see various TVs all the time.That said, unfortunately, as have many other people, I recently started experiencing the \"clicking\" problem, and the television just stopped working. It will cost me $400 to replace the part that failed, including labor.Nevertheless, I would still recommend this television. In fact, if I were buying this television new today, rather than avoid this television as others have recommended, I would try to use this defect to my advantage, and try to negotiate a substantial discount or an extended warranty in order to cover the future repair cost if and when the television fails.

And the knowledge that Samsung used a technology that was patented by another company makes me feel like I got a very unique TV. Almost like a collectors item that took the best Samsung tech and added in the best lighting tech. A big concern originally with my TV choice was the picture with standard digital cable. Alot of TVs look great while processing HD, but go to crap when standard video is processed. This TV doesn't have that issue at all. While the standard channels are less vibrant(less info within signal), sports and discovery channel with 250hz look outstanding. Mine did have a power issue, but I purchased the extended warranty through Samsung, and even after they contracted to another Co. here locally, they serviced it not only in the same day, but got the replacement parts from Samsung in 2 days. I always said, the cost of a warranty on a TV, while substantial in total, breaks down to low monthly cost for piece of mind. Just a cost that you should add into the TV price. Also, upon release of the last firmware upgrade, all picture issues(crop circles) no longer occur.

With the price now way above suggested retail, I guess it has achieved cult status now that Samsung stopped making them.The picture is great. No need to spend $300 on some unnecessary calibration, just adjust the picture to your liking or better yet set the mode to \"natural\" or \"standard\". Add a bluray player and you may never go to the movie theater again.Like many other happy UN55B8500 owners, I paid about $3000 and change for this set when it was on sale a number of months back. As much as I love this TV, I have to say it is not worth the $5900 pricetag they are now asking for. Nothing's perfect; for example the sound isn't that great if you don't connect it to better speakers and it's true what they say about the off-angle viewing: unless you set the piture to 'vivid' like they do in the showrooms which to me is too bright and cartoonish,  the color looks washed out if you are viewing the TV from the side---more so than other inferior sets. The swivel stand helps make up for this flaw, but only so much.But watching this TV dead center in front is addictive. The picture wil blow you away.

Oliver \"ankhmorpork\"", "ReviewID": "R1EFRU60W9L1ZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most of what I have to say about this TV has already been said -  it really is the one LCD to beat at the moment. Everything that's said about it really is true - the LED Local Dimming features really helps elevate blacks to - almost - the level of Plasma.So it's good, it's really good, but that's all been said before. Instead I'll focus on the elements that aren't quite there IMHO.FIrst off - the remote. It's RF (radio frequency), not IR (infra-red) like every other device out there.Not a big deal if you only use your TV remote, but it does mean you can't use your existing remote (e.g. cable box, receiver, etc.) to control the TV, and it also means you can't use the TV remote to control those other devices. So gone are the days of one universal remote to control everything, unless you want to go out and buy a Logitech Harmony 900 Remote Control (Black) to go with it.Given that the TV, almost by definition, is the one component that isn't going to be hidden away, it seems odd to have opted for RF over IR.Secondly, the stand. It really doesn't seem stable enough for such a large screen. Yes, it's sleek, it's subtle, but it doesn't seem to offer enough stability in my mind.If you're wall-mounting the screen you're fine (given a suitable wall mount bracket, of course), but be aware that the screen seems unstable when on the included mount. That said, it hasn't yet tipped, but living in an earthquake-prone area it's of special concern to me.Those are the only real issues I've encountered. There's a few other elements that might or might not be important to some people, but I've never seen them discussed anywhere before.The TV really needs some way of turning off the inputs that you're not using (or concerned with). I will likely never use an antenna connected directly to the TV, yet I can't remove the 'TV' option from the On Screen Menu (used to switch between inputs). Come on Samsung! why not? The same goes for the PC input. There's even a dedicated button on the remote to switch to this input. I'd guess that the majority of users nowadays would use a cable or satellite STB, so there should be some way of re-assigning that button to the users' preferred input rather than only linking to the antenna.It's worth noting that the OSD does demote idle HDMI connections so they're out of the way. It should be able to do the same with the other inputs, too.The TV has a digital optical output that relays sound from any input through to a receiver. In theory this works great, except that if using HDMI input to the TV, only 2-channel audio is output. This might be common (e.g. some idiotic limit of the HDMI standard), but it was completely unexpected to me.It does mean that you're going to be running audio (presumably optical) cables between any HDMI-based device and your receiver - you can't rely on the audio being routed through the TV.For reasons I don't understand, all the HDMI ports are arranged vertically on the left-hand side of the unit. While not a big problem, it does make routing cables harder and means you need longer cables than you might think - given the cost of good HDMI cables, this can add up. Samsung aren't alone here - most TVs I've looked at do the same thing, but it's inexplicable to me.On a similar note, the thin profile of this screen also extends to the connectors on the back - don't try and use cables with overly-thick connectors (such as some of the cables from people like Monster Cable. The TV just won't take them. To be fair, the manual does state a 14mm maximum thickness for cable connectors, but that's not until after you've unboxed the thing and are fiddling around with the cabling.One other thing I couldn't find documented anywhere - including Samsung's site - is power rating. The back plate lists 465W maximum - significantly better than just about any plasmas of the same size I looked at. Typical draw seems to be around 250-350W, depending on what you're viewing.I don't understand why power ratings are so hard to come by on these things.So despite the above all sounding negative, I'm really, really, happy with the TV - all the good things have already been said and I'm just highlighting the few things that caught me out.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's as good as they say", "Author": "Ethan Jones", "ReviewID": "R85EXDEUAWF2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not a huge TV buff myself, but this set seemed to be the best thing out there.

The array of LEDs really helps the overall quality become completely natural across the entire screen, side to side and top to bottom.  Is the picture worth $1,200? I don't think so.  So I'll wait until the price drops to a more reasonable level.  One other item I wanted to clear up. Many folks have commented on how the picture drops off at 15 or 30 deg. of viewing angle.  This worried me as I pictured how my computer screen really drops off at very small offset from head on...  This TV is nothing like my computer LCD!  Sure the picture drops off a little, but I went up to about 80 degrees off center and could still see the entire picture just fine. Go take a look and I'm sure you'll be impressed...
