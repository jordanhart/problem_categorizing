The previous model had outstanding picture quality and I didn't know how they can further improve it. First let's look at the dimensions, the previous model (UN55ES7500) is 48.8-Inch x 28.7-Inch x 1.2-Inch this one is 48.4 X 27.6 X 1.4 Inches without the stand. Surprisingly Samsung didn't make the TV slimmer actually it added 0.2 inches in thickness but it decreased the frame size to compensate for it. The TV was securely packed in a large box and it seemed to be very well protected so don't worry about buying this TV online. I tested this TV by watching a blu-ray disc, a dvd and playing Black Ops II on it. The blu-ray movie I watched was 300. I've watched this movie at least 15 times before but watching it on this TV was a different experience. I was looking for any flaw in the TV but couldn't find one, the colors were so rich and bright and shades were clearly distinguishable. This TV combined with a blu ray movie is enough to make people working for movie theaters go out of business, it is this good. The second movie I watched was dvd quality, I did this because blu ray looks good on any tv so I had to be sure. The movie I watched was Monster Inc and mike have never looked greener, the picture quality was good and the colors were vibrant. The last thing I tried on this tv was playing Call of Duty with my younger brother, this would allow me to test the sound of the TV. We played multiplayer split screen which means that the screen is divided into an upper part and a lower part, usually this interferes with the gaming experience but the tv's screen was large enough for us not to notice it. The sound of the tv was really good but it needed a subwoofer for additional bass, I would recommend a Polk Audio subwoofer if you want your system to be complete. The stand looked nice and I am very pleased with this purchase. My dog never watched TV on my old 32 vizio but now he declared the middle spot on the sofa and seem to be enjoying this TV as much as I do. Feel free to ask if you have any questions :)", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picture good -- firmware not so much", "Author": "Alex Neihaus", "ReviewID": "R2XK745AF84JUA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the UN60F7500 from a six-year-old Sharp 46\" LCD. So you can imagine how much better (and bigger) the picture looks. Yes, it's great though I am not sure how much of it is due to my eyes adjusting to a much bigger screen and how much of it is just the progress of the technology.Still, there are somethings I take issue with.1). Out of the box the motion compensation and color balance tend to make things look extraordinarily artificial -- but in a an attractive way. That is, if you don't mind your TV looking like it's not real, you're all set with the defaults. I set the TV to some recommendations I found in the UN60F7500 forum on avsforum.com and things look much better to me.2). Even after an upgrade, the TV occasionally crashes and reboots. That's a change for me from the Sharp which was just an appliance. The firmware is buggy. For example, when set to power on and power off my FiOS STB, it will only power it on.3). The remote is, in a word, awful. It has Bluetooth lag. It doesn't allow basic channel jumping without a complex sequence of strokes. It requires too many different presses to do simple things. The sensor strips at the top and sides are both too sensitive and not sensitive enough. Give me back my 2007 Sharp button-filled remote!4). I miss a printed, complete user manual. The online \"E-manual\" is insufficient. Feature details are missing and illogically explained. Samsung documentation ranges from stilted US English to incomprehensible.5). If your viewing position is below about the midpoint of the screen, you can forget using the camera. It pops up to be flush with the top bezel. It's not possible to tilt it down.All in all, it's a very nice upgrade. I took what I perceived to be a risk buying from Amazon but all went smoothly. Of course, this doesn't say much about what would happen if things didn't go well. But if you are playing the odds, they're in your favor with Amazon.Update 2013-06-29While I am enjoying the picture quality, I wanted to update this review to say that it's for some SERIOUS firmware issues, which I have only begun to experience as I got more familiar with the TV.1). Most Samsung apps don't really understand the 2013 Smart Remote, causing all kinds of odd, inconsistent interactions. Some get so stuck that even a power off/reboot doesn't reset the EV2), The DLNA functionality is MESSED UP. I have a Netgear ReadyNAS -- it's got an excellent DLNA implemenation. But the UN60F7500 cannot read the directories when selecting \"photos\" but can read the same directories when selecting \"all\" content. Go figure.Samsung promises an update in February -- until then, if the Smart TV portion of this device is why you are buying it, I'd recommend you hold off.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrific TV (won't be beat until 4k & OLED come out)", "Author": "Evo Owner", "ReviewID": "RLT35T28Z22DR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is fantastic TV with a great picture, snappy fast menus, and a very low profile look. I'm sure that you can read about the detailed features in the description, so I'll just mention what mattered to me when deciding:When comparing the F7500 to the 8000 (1 model up) and the 7100 (1 model down), there are just a few features that change (e.g. blur reduction, micro dimming, webcam). Frankly, you can't tell the difference in picture without a side-by-side comparison and some really keen eyes & the webcam isn't useful enough to change anyone's mind. The deciding feature for me was the faster quad-core chip and the Smart Evolution kit compatibility. In short, the menus on the 7500 and 8000 are just faster. Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, and especially Plex all load and play faster with the faster chip than on the lower models. Also, this chip only upgradeable ($200 extra kit later) on the 7500 and 8000. That means the top two models will be faster longer; the 7100 and below will not be able to be upgraded. Truthfully, I think Samsung is completely aware that the 7100 or even the 6300 are as good picture-wise as the upper end TVs, so they put in a slower chip and locked down the upgrade ability to force you into the higher end model. That was the case for me anyway.All in all, it's a great TV and I'm very happy with my purchase.Pair it together with a Sanus LL11-B1 mount from Crutchfield for a terrific low-profile that puts the screen <1\" from the wall.Pros:-Some useful SmartTV apps especially Plex, Netflix, Hulu+, and Pandora. If you don't know what Plex is, Google it immediately. It's basically a free Roku in your TV for playing your own music, movies, and pictures. Amazing! -Great picture, which is made even better with the thorough picture settings -Small bezel (~1/4\") and thin panel (~1/2\") -Very fast menu navigation due to quad core cpu -Wireless (this is 802.11 N, so it's very fast) -Camera can be hidden (unlike last year's modelCons:-The motion detection is gimmicky and not particularly useful. I hid the camera. -The SmartTV stuff is cool enough but not as good as a standalone Roku, AppleTV, or WD Play. -NOT A TOTAL CON, but the remote is a little different. What's great is how small, fast, and low profile it is. What's annoying is that is has so few buttons, that many inputs and options (ex. for a DVR) are hidden in secondary menus that require additional clicks to get to.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picture is magnificent", "Author": "Zenster", "ReviewID": "R3NP6FHGIJ0NKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We did our homework and chose this Samsung 7500 to replace our 8 year old 42 inch plasma. Amazingly this 55 inch screen is the same size as our 42 inch plasma with 6 inch borders. Easy to set up and get going. As I said the picture is magnificent. Took my wife and I a while to agree on which picture setting - dynamic, standard, natural or movie.We compromised movie for movies and natural for all else. Easy to switch using Samsung remote.At first we IR'd the Samsung remote with our cable box but did not like how it complicated things when you just want to turn on the TV, so removed it and now we use cable box remote for TV viewing and samsung remote for everything else.I like the clear voice setting for sound as it seems to subdue the background noise so you can follow dialogue - another great feature of this TVThe switch to web and use of the web browser was so easy, I easily attached an old wireless keyboard to a usb port on TV.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, but some serious flaws", "Author": "cmoisuperlea", "ReviewID": "RD95EV4RSALYY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this product two days before black Friday.  I saw an amazing price online and amazon matched the price because of a price guarantee.  I paid just under $1,200 tax included.The good:- the picture quality is absolutely gorgeous- the look of the tv is really great with the very slim bezel (i'm not a big fan of the tv stand that it comes with; its made of cheap plastic)- the remote takes a little getting used to, but once you've mastered that, its a pretty nice remote- this model comes with a web cam which is a nice feature for skype calls- 3D feature is pretty sweet.  I've watched a couple of movies in 3D and I was really impressed with the quality.  If you're streaming 3D movies make sure that you have a really fast internet connection as it takes a significant amount of data.The ugly:- serious wi-fi issues.  I'm having a lot of problems with wi-fi connectivity.  Although the TV shows a full signal to my wireless router it seems to drop the signal.  Sometimes it can happen 10 times during one movie!!!  That can be extremely frustrating.  Once it drops the signal it takes several minutes to reconnect to my router (apple airport) even though the TV see's the router in the menu and it displays full signal strength.  I have spoken to Samsung tech support and they told me that its not their fault because the router is in the room next door and not in the same room as my TV.  I think that's a pretty stupid excuse and defeats the purpose of having a wifi connection.  Tech support over the phone was pretty unhelpful.  I did my own fiddling with the settings and tried changing the channel on my router in case the problem was with interference from other devices, but I've still been unsuccessful in solving this problem.  I'm curious to see if other people have similar issues.- like most new TV's, the speakers are on the back and so if you have your tv set inside a wall unit (mine is inside a 4X4 ikea expedit shelf) then you lose a lot of your sound.  I think that's expected from most ultra slim tv's today and so a soundbar is a must.- When the TV is showing a dark or black image, you can see white shadows in the 4 corners of the TV.  I'm not sure what the cause of this is, but its pretty annoying.- annoying soap opera effect.  There is a function on this TV which makes your picture look like you're watching a soap opera.  If you're like me, don't worry, you can disable this feature really easily!  Press the menu button and go into the \"picture\" menu.  Scroll all the way down to \"picture options\".  Then scroll down to \"auto motion plus\".  You can then turn this off completely or choose one of the 4 other options available to you.I've only been using this TV for a few weeks now.  I will update this review when I have a bit more time to play with some of the other features.  I'm giving this TV 4 out of 5 stars because of the wifi issues.  I don't have cable TV at home and only stream movies online.  Wifi connectivity is extremely important.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "The interface and Smart TV features are disappointing; the rest is OK.", "Author": "Andrea", "ReviewID": "R2149SRN7SX11D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This December 2013 review is for the 46\u2019\u2019 model (UN46F7500). In general it is good quality, but many of the advanced features (Smart TV) do not work as expected. This is disappointing because those features are probably the reason you would like to buy this model. I suggest you buy the more inexpensive model which is much better value.PROs:- Assembling is easy, however, if you are not particularly strong, you need two people.- It\u2019s very stylish. It\u2019s incredibly thin and the bezel almost disappears.- Picture quality is OK; the only problem being the black levels which are not that black due to the backlighting technology; this is the price you pay for having a thin screen.- The camera's picture quality is great.- 3D works very well; slightly better than at the movie theater. (I personally get tired after a few minutes.)- There\u2019s a 2D -> 3D conversion function. I have no idea how it works, but they manage to give some 3D appearance to 2D movies. Really impressive. (I know, you might say, \u201cit\u2019s not possible\u201d, but they actually managed it.)CONs: The biggest disappointment is with the \u201cSmart\u201d features, the apps, and the interface:- Currently Skype doesn\u2019t work well. After a couple of minutes, you stop seeing the images from the other sides, while they continue seeing you fine. I spent some time in the Skype support forums and it looks like this has been a known problem for sometimes, and Skype says it\u2019s Samsung\u2019s fault, and Samsung says it\u2019s Skype\u2019s fault. Very disappointing. Using Skype was the main reason I bought this model with the camera, and it\u2019s unusable right now, with no solution in sight.- There are some weird limitations in what picture options you get according to the source. If you use external HDMI sources you can select all options; however if you use Netflix or Plex then you cannot select options such as \u201ccinema black\u201d. It just says \u201cthis option is not available\u201d without explaining what\u2019s going on. It took me a few days to understand it depends on the source.The interface is terrible:- The newly designed compact remote is not that usable. The trackpad is way too sensitive; for example, often I mistakenly exit a Netflix program by swiping left by mistake. Many apps are designed assuming that you can easily press \u201cA\u201d,\u201dB\u201d etc, but the remote doesn\u2019t have those buttons anymore. Now, you have to navigate through menus to reach a \u201cvirtual\u201d remote. I\u2019m considering buying a regular remote.- The microphone is not sensitive. I couldn\u2019t get voice commands to work without yelling towards the TV.- Similarly, the gesture-activated commands are mostly useless to use; it\u2019s tiring to wave in the air for several seconds, while you could reach for the remote with less effort.In conclusion, a better value for the money would be to get an inferior model (F7100 or the 6 series, even) because they have the same picture quality without the Smart TV features, and then rely on a Roku or Apple TV to give the \u201csmarts\u201d to your TV.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice! 3D works great!!", "Author": "Shashi", "ReviewID": "R20S857K6MDE49", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works great. Have been reading/hearing about spontaneous restarts...had it happen once since I bought it. The screen goes GREEN for a few seconds and then restarts. But it happened only once and I was jumping between the installed apps. The 3D glasses work pretty neat. I could watch a regular 720p Youtube video in 3D. Was very good quality. The set-up is a bit tiring to get through, but is well worth it. The smart remote is not too useful. The volume and channel buttons on the Smart remote are VERY hard to press making it pretty much useless. The \"Hand Waving\" function starts up...looks like a lot of fun to use but your arms get tired trying to learn it. The built in camera is super for Skype chats! The video is pretty wide and covers our full 3 seater couch (set at ~8-9 feet from the TV). Still haven't seen the performance difference in the 240Hz compared to the 120Hz.

Here is what I think about this TV:1- The TV looks very elegant with the very thin frame.2- The picture quality is good, you will see a difference in the picture quality in compression to a lower end Samsung Tv's but not even close to what Samsung and the sales guy claim, I think these days most of the TV's at this price range will give you a good quality picture.3- I like the voice control it comes handy and fast in searching TV channels for example when I talk to the remote control asking for golf channels a list of all channels playing golf comes on the screen.4- I also like the motion control feature. It's fun and conveyance when the remote control is away from you. I work on my laptop while the TV is playing the back ground, so it's great to control the tv with a move of your hand. For my friend in the previous review who complain about their arm getting tired when they do the motion gestures I say a little exercise on your couch is beneficial lol5 The camera picture quality is not the greatest and it depends to a great extent on the light source amount and direction in the room6  To the few reviewers and readers who don't read the manual like me and who complained about the camera is showing only the tip of their heads I say the fix is easy the camera has a little switch on the back that controls if the camera is looking up or down7  The quad core computer processor is fast and the speed of surfing is noticeable in compassion to the dual core TV's8 The remote control is elegant, small and efficient, I think the large remote control with million buttons will become a dinosaur in the few years.9 Finally I say the TV is worth the money if you're welling to pay the extra $ for the extra features.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "great hdtv", "Author": "pjay \"pjay\"", "ReviewID": "R8DBIOK41KSD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this ia great tv if you are searching for amazing picture quality.the 240 hz motion detection does its job while watching fast movie scenes.HD picture resolution is great, color reproduction is very close to natural and unique.my wife says she sees the soap opera effect when the tv is in standard mode.  when switched tomovie mode it goes away though.i had a plasma before and the experience was different. the colors  are less softer withLED and it takes time to get adjusted . do not mistake the loss in softness as a reduction in quality.LED/LCD is a different screen than plasma.the things that i dont like are the remote control which is not very user friendly , the software can be improved in general and SD/analog  quality is not that great.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "mike", "ReviewID": "RJQCLVBAJARY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV is great.

I like how this TV has some height above the stand unlike the 8000 series that sites about an inch from the base. With that being said, all that distance must have been complicated for Samsung because it has a tendency to be off balance. I notified Amazon of this and they were willing to swap out the unit or give me a refund. I opted to keep it. I will be hanging the TV in the future and this will not matter.

Stewart", "ReviewID": "R1OD1X207OM0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV because it has an MHL port and I wanted to use the Roku Streaming Stick with it. It is mounted in our kitchen and has no cable or antenna so we get all of our video via a Wi-Fi connection. It has great built in apps and I mostly use Netflix and Plex plus Google Chromecast connected to one of the 4 HDMI ports and one of the 3 USB's for power. It is very user friendly and a great picture, especially when viewing 1080p content. Unfortunately I found out the hard way that the Roku Streaming Stick doesn't function correctly with the MHL port on this TV so I upgraded to Roku 3. I learned yesterday that Roku just announced a Streaming Stick that does not need an MHL port and like Chromecast just requires an HDMI port and a 1A USB port for power and this TV has one powered USB port with the other two providing .5A power source. I mounted it flush against the wall and use it to display recipes and other media while working in the kitchen. I do wish it were more friendly for people like me that don't use TV (cable or antenna) input. Some of the features such as PIP only work with TV input and not the other input sources that I use.The picture is superb and the remote is excellent. I also bought the wireless keyboard for browsing but haven't used it too much yet. I think browsing with a laptop and using Chromecast is probably easier. One piece of information that is hard to come by is a picture of the ports on the back once it is mounted on the wall so I took a picture for reference if anyone else wants to access it in the future.

I went to several different electronics stores and websites before settling on Amazon. Compared to everywhere else I went, Amazon was at least $200 cheaper. That being said though, we bought the TV through another company listed through Amazon, and I have to say, I wasnt all too impressed with how long it took our TV to get here. For one, it took a week for it to show up to our house, secondly they used some delivery service that Ive never heard of and the truck driver was very rude. Third and certainly not least, the box came damaged, but thankfully nothing was broken and the TV didnt have any scratches or dents. I made sure it was perfect before that truck driver left. I wont rate poorly on this product because of my bad experience with the outside company though. So on to the actual TV review.As soon as we turned the TV on, my fiancee and I were absolutely stunned! We upgraded from a 32\" Samsung LCD which Ive had for about 5 years, which has traveled with me from at least 6 different apartments/houses and has even traveled cross country with me in the back of my car. I like to call it \"Ole Reliable\" because it has never let me down. So once we sat down in front of a \"60 LED, I couldn't believe how clear and vibrant the picture quality was. The SMART features are great, but I guess I've been spoiled with my android devices, because the apps didn't seem up to par. I was hoping that the SMART screens would be customizable, but I cant seem to figure that out. What I mean by that is, I would like to make my starting/home screen the apps menu with whatever is playing in the background, not the cable channel suggestions page. We don't have cable, so its pointless to have this screen. The sound is decent, not as good as my old TV, but I expected that going with the LED and I was also forewarned from all the reviews. I have computer speakers with a 10\" sub woofer that I used with my older set and I figured I would just use them with this TV. Well I have to say, getting them to work was a pain in the butt. The speakers have AVS outputs and the TV comes with an AVS converter, so I just put 2 n 2 together and hooked it up that way, but as soon as I put on Pandora, the sound only came through the TV. A little frustrated, I tried taking the converter off and just plugging the AVS cables straight into the AVS input slots. That didnt work either, so I searched high and low on the internet to figure out what I was doing wrong. it took me 3 days to finally figure out on my own that I had to use the one single cable that I always use to play music from my phone. I took that cable(not sure what its called) and plugged it into the Audio Out port. HOORAY, WE GOT SOUND! I would have been severely upset if I had to go out and spend more money on a sound bar or home theater system so soon. As far as the picture settings go, they are a pain in the butt let me tell you. I'm a tech junkie and can usually figure stuff out pretty well on my own, but calibrating the right picture quality is something that I hope I will never have to do again anytime soon. For one, the 10p White Balance is tough to get perfect, and the intervals for said balance is still a mystery to me. Getting the back lighting just right was annoying and I still feel the contrast is off a little. What ever happened to the good old days where you picked between Dynamic, Standard and Movie and you didn't have to mess with anything else? I guess having a TV for 5 years has dulled down my TV knowledge. Oh before I forget, if anyone is a gamer and is going to use this TV heavily for gaming, you might get annoyed after a while having to always go into the settings and switch to \"Game Mode\" every time you want to play. After 3 days of this, Im already hating this feature. Other then that, I think this TV is well worth the money spent, and my wife is in love! :)- RECAP -Pros1. Outstanding picture quality2. Wide selection of apps for everyone to enjoy3. Amazing design4. Has the upgrade feature so when the time comes, you dont have to buy a whole new TV5. Navigation through the TV is fluid and flawless6. The camera and voice recognition features are a fun way to interact with the TVCons1. Sound quality2. Picture calibration is tough for those who aren't TV savvy3. SMART screens non customizable4. Remote is a little frustrating, but nothing too serious5. The game mode setting should be able to turn on and off automatically so that the user doesn't have to manually turn it on every time he/she wants to play a gameI hope you enjoyed my review and it helps you make a better decision on what kind of TV you want. I would highly recommend Samsung TV's, I've always enjoyed the quality and have never experienced a problem with their products.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easy to hook up; beautiful color and sharpness", "Author": "I Do The Speed Limit", "ReviewID": "RQRT3N3S3EFMX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We did a lot of comparison shopping between name brand HDTVs.  For the value, we thought Samsung won, without a doubt in our minds.  We went with the LED because it gave us the best color and sharpest picture.  We went with 240Hz because the action on the screen did not make us dizzy:  The action was sharp, quick, to-the-point.  We went with the \"Slim\" because it gave us a border that receded into the background, (rather than the in-your-face, shiny, black one-inch (or so) border of the regular screen).  We didn't care about the 3D feature, but the features we did want did not come without the 3D.  So 3D is getting a free-ride here.Another aspect of the Samsung brand:  The \"Smart\" in Samsung Smart TVs means that it links to Amazon video and my Kindle HDX 8.9\" and other internet \"stuff\", too.  And that also means that you have extra Amazon support from their technicians in setting things up.  The day (maybe it a day later) I placed my order, Amazon began communicating (via emails) with me regarding all the avenues of support and help that I could expect once my TV arrived.  It was comforting, and it was a nice touch.Regarding set-up:  The TV was easy to remove from its box and simple to assemble.  Set-up (connecting all the wires to the correct ports) was fairly simple, even hooking up my old (bought around 2001) Bose 3-2-1 sound system.Other info that might be helpful:--One pixel is not working, (at least that is what we think the single, bright red dot is on the screen, but as it is not visible from viewing distance, we have let that issue slide.  We were not about to go through the rigmarole of re-packing and shipping the TV back to Amazon, just for one pixel.--The border and the stand are shiny silver.  We would have preferred a brushed or satin finish, but we could not find any models that come with that feature.--If you are replacing an older TV that is not a flat screen, and if you are unfamiliar with current lingo and are a little fearful of where all the wires go:  If you are a patient person, you can work with the quick set-up guide and the more detailed operating manual and get this TV working in a few hour's time.  It may be frustrating, because the manual is not the best, but common sense, perseverance and patience will see you through it.  If you are unfamiliar with some terminology, a quick internet search will tell you what you need to know.  I guess I'm saying that you don't have to buy your TV locally because you think you'll need a technician to come out and set it up for you.  You can really have it shipped to you and do the set-up yourself.--The color, contrast, etc. controls are very easy to find and fiddle with yourself.All in all, we are happy with our new HDTV and are really looking forward to watching the 2013 Winter Olympics in style!", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent upgrade from my first generation LCD HDTV", "Author": "Chris Hertenstein", "ReviewID": "RC0H5SD1S77F5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, very happy with the UN55F7500.

I imagine that I'll eventually venture into picture settings for tweaking reasons but at the moment I can't justify doing so. The first day of viewing had me second guessing going with the 60 inch version, average viewing distance in my room is 11 feet. This samsung replaces a 50 inch LG which was plenty big in my opinion, but a friend convinced me to go 60. After a few days of viewing I believe 60 was the right choice, bigger is better I guess. I have zero complaints regarding the monitor.Remote; I personally don't use all of the extra bells whistles so I can't really comment on their functionality. My 20 year old son who's home on Christmas break claims that with the exception of voice commands he mastered the high tech remote in one afternoon without much of a hassle, he tells me the voice option does not belong but other then that he likes it.Smart TV; We've managed to access both Netflix and Amazon prime without any problem.

Its smarter than I am.  I have had it now for 2 1/2 weeks and I'm still finding out things that it can do.  I got the 60\" unit to replace an old 60% Samsung DLP TV that was on its last legs.  My new TV is so different from the old one, we are finding that it takes time to get used to how sharp the picture is.  It actually makes some shows look phony because the TV is better than the cameras they used to shoot the movie with.My only complaint has to do with service.  My TV came with a dead pixel.  I called Samsung to complain and asked them to have it fixed.  No big deal, the TV is under warranty for a year, etc.  They opened a repair order and assigned it to Lakes Electronics who is a vendor they use in my area.  Lakes contacted me the next day.  The woman I spoke with did not sound pleased that she was being asked to service a TV for just one dead pixel but regardless she asked me to take a picture of the offending pixel and email it to her, which I did right away.  Then, silence.  I heard nothing back from Lakes.  Since I work for a living I was not able to call them until after work and by that time they were closed.  Their automated attendant did not provide the ability to leave a voice mail.  No worries, I thought, I will send them an email.  Silence . . . .  So I downloaded Samsung's We Care app (boy is that a joke), only to find that Lakes Electronics had closed out my repair order with a note complaining that they could not reach me!  Ok, so after I had calmed down a bit, I called Lakes Electronics and asked them to open the repair order and come out and fix my TV.  The Lakes lady said she could not do that and that I would have to call Samsung and have them reissue another repair order.  Ok, so I figured there was no point in fighting Town Hall, so I called Samsung.  This was on 12/4.  I spoke with a nice young man who was suitably indignant on my behalf and who promised to reissue the repair order forth with.  He promised that someone from Lakes would be in touch with me within 24 to 48 hours.  Well here we are 48 hours later and I have not heard from anyone, so I called Samsung again and low and behold, I come to find out that the young man I spoke with two days ago did nothing!!  He did not place the repair order he promised that he would do for me and all the Samsung rep can do for me at this point is to start from scratch and place a new repair order today which means I would have to wait until at least sometime next week before hearing from anyone and it will likely be the same deadbeat Lakes Electronics.  So I asked to speak with a Supervisor, which I find usually works if I need to have something escalated and I think I have ample reasons to have these issues escalated.  The Supervisor, Jessica, said that she can either place the repair order with Lakes for the next available time slot with is 12/12 and then I am free to call them to negotiate a better day, or she can ask their Dispatch Operators to call me sometime tomorrow and schedule the repair with another company but in order to do this she would have to cancel the order with Lakes.  AT this point I am thinking better the bird in the hand than two in the bush, so I go with the Lakes Electronics 12/12 date and the bad taste in my mouth.So the moral of this story, boys and girls, is that this is a terrific TV with a beautiful picture and a bevy of features and toys to keep you busy for a long time.  The Samsung online support is excellent and well positioned to grow with the technology, but watch out if you actually need any onside repair service.

I set this up last night and fought and fought the Internet Connection to my wireless router, which is necessary to use the Smart features.  I finally got on Samsung support and found that my router, the Cisco Linksys EA4500 Media Stream N900 Smart Wi-Fi Router, had issues with this TV and Samsung wrote a patch and put it in firmware available as a download from their support site.  I got the firmware and loaded it onto a USB jump drive, plugged it into the TV.  Followed the directions given on Samsung's website for installing it and it fixed it!  I was able to complete the set up.  The picture is great.  It recognized the cable box and Samsung 3D Bluray player (E series) and a USB portable HD with videos/photos, and my PC, which is set up to stream.  I am waiting on the Samsung 551 Soundbar/receiver.  The remote is tiny.  But the touch pad is generous.  The aren't many buttons.  The additional \"buttons\" that were on the previous TVs remote are available by pushing the \"more\" button on the remote, which puts a pop up on the bottom left hand side of the TV screen.  You operate it with the touch pad and you can also draw numbers on the touchpad to input channel selections...as no numbers are available on the remote, just up and down arrows.  You might want to keep a stylus handy.  The voice recognition works great.  There will be a learning curve for my husband, but I think he'll be much happier not having to fight 4 remotes to watch 1 show!  And, here I thought guys were remote savvy...  This is a great TV for the technophobe...once they understand there's no going back to the old two knob (on/off/volume and channel selector) vaccuum tube TVs.Additional information.  IF you have a Linksys EA4500N wireless Router, you will need to download firmware from Samsung support, load it onto a USB and let it install to get the Internet connection to work.Camera:  As has shown up in other reviews, this is not adjustable and unless your TV camera is at eye level, you will have to get off the couch and stand to be seen.  Virtually unusable.  I tried to hook up via USB the Samsung External Camera I had on my old D-series Smart TV.  But the TV does not recognize it and Samsung support says there is no way to do this.  I am hanging onto my external camera in the hope that Samsung will write some firmware to allow this to be used.  Please!Some of the features in Broadcast, CC, favorite channels list and such, may not be available depending on your set top box.  I am going to have a chat with my cable provider to see if they have a newer, smart tv friendlier device.Will update this review as I go.FYI:  Fabulous picture!  I have the Samsung HW-F551 Soundbar/receiver hooked up to this TV. Fabulous Sound, too! However, though the Universal Remote feature does recognize and switch the virtual remote from your set top box to the Bluray player, depending on how it is hooked up, to use the extra features of the soundbar, you have to use its remote.

I got my TV for less than half of a 4K and the large open scenes look so amazing. I have begun to watch all my Blu-ray movies again now in true HD. I don't use the camera very much, and to be honest I think the camera should be able to point further down so if I did want to Skype, I wouldn't have to stand up. The camera points half way up my wall and doesn't see much of me sitting in the couch.The voice command stuff is a neat feature, but I do not use it much. It does seem to catch some voices off the surround sound thinking that I'm saying \"hi TV\" and it mutes the volume waiting for a command.

The LG Magic Remote QWERTY is by far a better solution than Samsung's remote control.Worst part of the Samsung Smart Touch Remote is the battery life.  The remote delivered with my TV consumes fresh 2 AA batteries every 30-40 days.  No exaggeration.  This is with literally only watching the TV about 7 hours each week.Samsung thinks this is perfectly reasonable.  Here is Samsung's response when asked about the astonishing battery consumption rate:I said \"I have had this TV about 3 months and I just replaced the AA batteries in the remote control for the third time.  This remote control should not require new batteries every 30 days.  Why is this remote control using batteries so quickly and how do we stop it from consuming so many batteries?\"Samsung replied \"I would like to inform you that your TV comes with the Smart touch remote controller and basically these remote controller consumes more power when compared to standard remote controller and also the battery life of the controller depends upon the usage of the controller.\"If Samsung thinks it's ok for the remote to consume so much power, they could at least supply rechargeable batteries.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very pleased w/ this UN46F7500 46 inch!", "Author": "LAHIRI", "ReviewID": "R1LRKMBSADJPFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic I wanted didn't fit.

All I could find worthy of the expense were 46\" ones but their overall sizes exceeded what space I had... until this one.  I double, triple and quadruple checked various sources before purchasing this one because I couldn't figure out how it was smaller than it's similar models from Samsung.  It fit perfectly into the space I have for a TV... 3/16\" space on each side... PERFECT!The price I paid ($1600) was quite nice for such a high-end 46\" LED TV.  It has a built in retractable camera, dual microphones (for stereo), 3D with four sets of glasses, voice and gesture interactions... ALL of which I have disabled because I do not have a desire for those features... Not even a curiosity!  The menus are logical and attractive.  Internet connectivity and streaming is flawless!Assembly and \"first-time-setup\" was easy and quick.  I did make the mistake of getting ahead of myself installing the stand but only set me back a few minutes...The 240MHz refresh rate and 46\" screen really is an awesome upgrade from my previous LED TV.  Once adjusted, the picture has been smooth during \"action sequences\" with crisp definition and fantastic looking brightness, contrast and saturation.  I am noticing some of the lower definition programming of local channels more obviously with a hint of ghosting.  DVD playback looks better than a movie theater!!!The integrated speakers, once again after I adjusted them, sound phenomenally better than any TV I've ever watched.  I use to always use my surround sound system to experience the depth of audio for various programs or movies, but this TV's speakers do a fantastic job emulating the surround sound experience.And now the reasons (2) for the 4 out of 5 stars:1. I dislike the remote control... A LOT!  For the majority of it's functionality it requires use of a tactile-mechanical touch pad that has given me more frustration than I've ever experienced!  It's either too sensitive or not sensitive enough.  I'm continually struggling to scroll through menus smoothly having to resort to laying the remote onto my coffee table and gently interact with it with one finger in deliberate, tiny movements... AND STILL HAVE ISSUES!!!  That's why I WILL be replacing it with a universal remote (Logitech Harmony) in the VERY near future!!  I do, however, like the dim back-lighting, which can be disabled, of the buttons as well as their unique shapes.2. YouTube menu... There is no way to watch playlists and playback is not in sequential order.  I have specific subscriptions for specific playlists and it's painfully aggravating to have to navigate through ALL the subscription content just to see what I want to see.  Playback is from newest to oldest with no way to change it.  The playlists I watch are in sequential order and I must manually select the correct video every time.Other than those few gripes...

I was afraid that it may turn out to be that good.

This avoids the need for an additional S/PDIF cable. I will not even bother with web browser, voice and hand gestures, can't expect those features to be up to the mark. When you buy a TV you buy it for the picture quality and I have no complaints there.The only downside is that it looks a bit flimsy as it is very thin and the stand does not look solid. I am used to the Sony that I have, which looks rock solid. The flip side is that this is genuinely thin and therefore the stand is lighter which is also a positive. The Sony I mentioned is 5 years old and back then TV's were heavier and therefore looked sturdier.I watched a baseball innings in 3D, novel idea but sitting and watching with those glasses is not my cup of tea.

I'm thoroughly impressed with this TV.  Does it have too much to offer in form of user capabilites, probably yes.  I rarely use the 3D (and would have purchased a cheaper option without it probably but that wasn't offered), never use the gesture control, voice rarely, and camera rarely but glad you can hide it down with a push.  I use a Roku2XD (don't have cable) and it does great, HuluPlus and HBOGO look incredible when playing shows, I actually prefer using the easy user interface of this accessory over the Samsung SmartHub, I also experienced app issues.  I also updated to the latest software that the support website has available through a zip file (takes a while).  I finally got my BluRay player in to fully test it out and watched Dark Knight Rises, Lincoln, and Pitch Perfect all in the same weekend... MIND BLOWN!  The clarity, color quality, smooth transitioning, vast sound range (I use Movie and Music setting under the menu when switching between TV and Pandora), all added up to an electrifying experience.  Samsung has truly made me a believer and future customer.  I've also hooked up a USB drive to look at pictures (I'm a hobbyist) and am truly in awe, I just wish I could get them to look that good when they're printed.  I've noticed anything that was digitally created works fantastic with this TV, like the opening to DKR.  I've never seen such great picture quality in any store or at any friend's house.  I would highly recommend buying this TV.  I'm a 25 yr old male who is hard to please when it comes to expensive electronics, but like I said this TV is MIND BLOWING!ISSUES:I wish the TV controller was more simple and easy to understand, I feel like the touch/swipe pad could be quicker if it were just buttons like all the other controllers. Apps sometimes give me issues/uninstall. I would be scared to wall mount it, it's pretty heavy, and struggles to rotate on its stand (love the thin/minimal border though), wish there was an shortcut to switch the sound menu setting from movie to music since I switch to Pandora alot in the mornings, also you can't hard code free broadcasted channels through an antenna if it doesn't find them you won't ever get them. In a world demanding options there's still some of us that like things a bit simpler but every option has been easy to figure out, just prefer some over others, to each his own.OVERALL:Even with slight issues, I'm still giving this TV 5 stars, no doubt.

Need two people to put on mount.With 240hz or Samsung's equivalent to it, I see almost no motion lag. Any motion lag I do see I blame the content provider, like my aging Xbox 360.Motion controls using hands are neat and at times seem to work better than kinect's first version. But the cursor requires precise movements than are sometimes hard to obtain with your hands. I leave motion controls off. Voice search using remote microphone can sometimes work well but the easiest control method is to just use the track pad. Internal settings are complex but Samsung did a good job of bringing the stuff you needed right to the front lines with their Quick Options button on the remote.I don't think the wifi-adapter built in is exactly quality because at certain times while watch netflix I'll see things (lag, video pixel glitches, video quality differences) that I never saw on the xbox netflix app, BUT it doesn't always happen and the web browser experience usually has no lag.I wouldn't bother with the presets in clearmotion (lg users know this as trumotion).

The most impressive thing to me is the bezel or lack there of.

That being said I'll update this review after I've had some time to experiment and explore this unit more. So far so good.I have to admit I am blown away.Pros:Wifi: Just connecting this to wifi was a snap and unlocks the bulk of your Smart TV's features3D: I never imagined I would be sitting at home watching movies in 3D as I always felt the glasses were either over weight or just plain goofy.  So label me goofy but this is outstanding.  Admittedly all I've seen so far are Disney/Pixar movies but they rock in 3D How to Tame Your Dragon and The Incredibles are by far my favorites.Allshare/Samsung Link/Screen Mirroring:Can you really enjoy any Android device without utilizing some of it's more prominent features? Samsung Link is just a way to to share what's on your Samsung (Android) device be it Tab, Note, Galaxy etc between the device and the TV.  This works so perfectly.  You have company over and want to share photos, videos or music? Go right ahead and fire this baby up and it's quite awesome.  Start a picture slideshow and set it to music simply awesome. Even one step further is Screen mirroring. It's like Samsung Link but it just mirror's your device.Picture Quality: It stable and ultra beautiful. The ultra thin bezel is just unbelievable and makes you feel as if you're getting the maximum size of your television. I could go on but I think you get the picture.I can't talk about the camera or the audio features as the location of the TV is too high to the ceiling and the audio features annoyed my wife so I turn it off.Cons: Price only because it's very pricey but I feel it was worth every penny.All and all this unit rocks and I can't say enough good about it.

The 3d is great. Tv setup is very simplistic. Its got a lot of great gadgets. I enjoy getting on youtube and watching some of my videos i've made riding my horse. (on my phone but the tv's bluetooth picks it up and can play it also).The first Tv that came i had returned because it was turning itself off w/out sleep timer or updates. I'd be sitting there watching. Main annoyance is this particular tv Has an annoying buzz coming from it 2-3 times per hour. Totally random and it lasts for at least 3-7 seconds. So i returned that tv. Got a replacement and this one is doing the exact same thing. The odds of getting 2 bad tv's has to be impossible. I feel helpless in the situation.Other negatives. The remote as others have mentioned. It's small, clumsy, very fragile. Don't dare drop it becaues im sure the plastic would break( i dont want to find out). I bought the square trade 4year warranty. If they made an 8 year i'd be all over that. To me thats so sad. Every samsung tv i've had has crapped out after 3-5 years. I've owned 3-4 tv's from them, 1 monitor.Hand gestures are relatively useless, for me on the tv. Waving of the hands etc just seems to confuse the tv. Then you have to speak loud n' clear into the remote for it to understand you. Then the tv talks about to you super loud.My main reason for the 2 start rating is due to this tv's flaws and or defects. Inability to produce a tv that will last. I'm not rich by any means. I dont see myself being able to keep buying tv's with warranties tax etc nearly 2,000$. C'mon samsung put out a lasting product. Stop sacrificing quality materials for profit. Losing customers due to poor quality control is bad business.I regret not trying Sony this time. Or Even walmart brand at this point.This is just an honest Texan review, its quite opinionated but honest. I heavily rely on other peoples reviews. There's not much i buy that i dont read almost every review.Good luck to anyone thinking about this model tv. I'd spend a little extra and go a model higher and hope for the best or just avoid Samsung altogether. I have friends who have had zero issues with  Samsung.

Damn, this TV is big! It's a good thing I didn't go for the 70\" (or, even, the 65\"). Anyway, this TV makes my little living room feel like a private screening room. People are so large, I feel like they're actually in my apartment.And I'm glad I opted for the 7500 over the 8000, as its swivel base allows me to sit dead center for the best color and clarity.So, after setting up the Netflix app, and logging in to my account, I noticed that, for some reason, this set displays only an incomplete Instant Queue (or, \"My List\" as it is now called). Granted, Netflix supposedly limits invidiual lists to 500 titles but, at some point, I was able to reach 700. I've pared it down to just over 600, and my Roku shows every title - as does my TiVo and my LG BluRay player, so why doesn't the Samsung TV?Another small beef I have is with the remote. I love the metallic style, the raised icons and its heaviness in my hand, but the touchpad (its scrolling capability, anyway) is, at times, oversensitive, while, at other times, resistant. When using the virtual keyboard, I found myself constantly deleting undesired key entries, skipping keys and, simply put, going back-and-forth multiple times.Now, if I could just figure out the surefire way to verify that I am watching each program in its correct aspect ratio.UPDATED 10/2/13:For those of you are teaming this television with TiVo, I have settled on the best possible combination of screen formats, though the result is still a bit unsatisfactory. TiVo has three options: Full, Panel and Zoom. This television also offers several options when paired with TiVo Premiere (standard menus - I don't yet know if the HD menus have any effect on these options). Regardless of any other component's options, for proper aspect ratio calculations, this television should remain set at 16:9; any other setting will either distort or crop the picture.So, with the TV set at 16:9, the results are as follows:TiVo set at \"Full\" = picture squeezed (or squished, as it were) from top to bottom, so image looks as if it's being projected onto a funhouse mirrorTiVo set at \"Panel\" = black borders on all four sides of picture, so image looks like a picture within a frame, while about 30% of television screen is black; picture, however, is neither cropped nor distorted and retains sharpness (in foreign films, subtitles are clear and legible)TiVo set at \"Zoom\" = picture fills entire television screen with negligible cropping, but image appears grainy and fuzzy, especially noticeable in foreign films, where subtitles are somewhat blurry.Hopefully, when I use by BluRay player and my TiVo Roamio, both connected via HDMI, I will experience much better image reproduction.Oh, and I do notice some minor flashlighting in the corners of the screen, but it only bothers me when I think about it or look for it.But one extremely annoying element is the fact that, with Samsung TVs, you cannot use ARC without AnyNet, but AnyNet fouls up my system by randomly switching the inputs on my AV receiver. I have my old DrekTV satellite receiver connected via RCA cables to the TV/SAT (DUH!) input jacks on my receiver. There is no HDMI input slot for TV/SAT (why not?); otherwise, I would have connected my TiVo Roamio to it. But, with AnyNet \"on\" (so that I can use ARC and the control features that allow me to turn both my TV and receiver on with just one button), EVERY TIME I turn on the television, I have to wait about 10-20 seconds for AnyNet to switch my receiver from its previous input setting to TV/SAT, so that I can then reach for my receiver's remote to manually switch it back (fun times!). I've even tried turning on the receiver first, but doesn't that defeat the purpose of the one-button synchronization? Even so, this method only delays the result, which is the same as above.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung, I could leave it", "Author": "Russ \"Gorloth\"", "ReviewID": "R2EDRLXPBD8FQR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Here goes. Basically there are currently 4 technologies that compete for your your home.  AMOLED, LCD w/white LED backlighting (this tv being reviewed) Plasma and DLP. Well DLP is just about dead. It's almost like VHS vs Beta. It's history. So now there are 3 left. Plasma is being discontinued. The best which was the top end Panasonic, will be gone come 2014. They are moving 1/2 of their development team to AMLED technology development. So now there is AMOLED and LCD w/LED backlighting. The TV industry is touting LED TV\"S when in reality they are talking about LCD TV's with LED backlighting. They are purposely trying to confuse you. AMOLED tv's are just expoentially better than LED tv's. AMOLED is the big kahuna. These LCD w/ LED backlighting are crap. First and for most for your viewing pleasure you want a picture that will show a linear range of tones from black to white. The difference in 100 words or less id that LCD is a liquid crystal display. To show any light it must have a backlight. So they use LED's which are very energy efficient. Al Gore will love you for it. AMOLED's are actually Light emitting Diodes which show ranges from black to white. Let me be more specific about that. When showing black, they are OFF, meaning zero light emitting. Walk into a dark room with a AMOLED TV showing black and you won't be able to see the TV at all. This Samsung and LCD tv's and you will see a gray rectangle which is supposed to be black. To be short about it. LCD w LED backlighting shows about 15% black to bright white. AMOLED will show 0% to 100%. Thus they are more 3 dimensional. So to rate this TV, at $1350 ~ $1600,  just buy a less expensive one. This one's not worth it. AMOLED will blow it out of the water. AMOLED is the very latest technology, so it will bear a very high price tag at first, but it is actually cheaper to make than LCD TV's so the price will come down drastically, and soon. SO I got this TV because I got a decent price on Cyber Monday and from Amazon. I probably should of bought a lesser model in this size range. However I'm waiting for a 4K TV based on AMOLED for my home theater. This one was for my bedroom. I would of bought the Panasonic plasma 42\" but they quit making the 1080p and only offer the 720p version. and then plasma is going away. That would of been a no brainer, but I got this Samsung, guess I'll have to live with it.. it's charcoal colored black's and all.

You would think that for a $1400 TV that Samsung could get this right. I spent 30 minutes at Home Depot, who could not fix it, but directed me to a local hardware store, Turner Hardware. The next morning the helpful staff at Turner literally re-threaded the screw sockets for me, and then put it together for me with 4 new screws. He charged me 91 cents for 4 screws.Earlier I had phoned Samsung and asked them to send me the replacement parts, and they said they would, and I would receive in 5 to 14 days. I said no, no, no, they needed to overnight the screws to me. They said they couldn't do that. Say what? They screw up my shipment, and can't expedite replacement parts?  That's just silly.Samsung said I had to email then my receipt to receive the replacement screws. They then said what I sent them was invalid as it did not contain the payment method. Seriously? For them to say they have to have my method of payment to make the receipt valid is absurd. I don\u2019t give out that kind of information, as it has absolutely nothing to do with the problem or their failure to perform, and it is none of their business.

Their own repair people told me to just buy a new SAMSUNG set!!!SAMSUNG:No Customer SupportSystemic Panel DefectGhosting of imagesBurn-in on screenDistorted pictureVery expensive to repair", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY IF YOU CARE ABOUT SOUND!!!", "Author": "Melissa Carrington", "ReviewID": "R38MXEACQ7S9W4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV after seeing the picture and being amazed by the quality.  However, I have had nothing but trouble since getting it home.The TV does not allow for any 5.1 sound to pass through and if you send your components through an AVR and then to the TV it will not let you use the smart hub features.  Yes, I said that right.  The smart hub has no way to send audio out through HDMI.  Therefore you have to use toslink.  But you must also have a cable box plugged into the TV.  If you do not, then the TV software shuts down sending any audio out.  Therefore, if you care about using the smart hub, apps, or getting 5.1 sound out of anything, DO NOT BUY THIS TV.  All it is good for is plugging in a cable box and listening through the TV speakers.  Yes, you could send 2 channel audio to an AVR but all that would do is make it louder.I have been on the phone for countless hours with Samsung and they instructed me to buy a bunch of cables for work arounds so that I can get 5.1 sound or ANY sound at all from the smart hub.  However, after all that failed they told me that the TV is just not compatible with anything and I am out of luck.1 star for picture quality.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "DONT BY THIS JUNK", "Author": "2morrow", "ReviewID": "R2JRDC8YA4XIYZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just 45 days out of the box the Samsung turned off by itself and won't turn back on.WOW this is just great 4 days before the Super Bowl!!GDSOBI'm pissed off and will never buy another Samsung product ever again!!", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Shipping issue", "Author": "Evan Lengerich", "ReviewID": "R34RVZ2UMJL5VF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was really excited about this TV to come from all the reviews I read.
