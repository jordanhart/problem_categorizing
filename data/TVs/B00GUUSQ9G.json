(Sorry Amazon) TV is very light, and extremely easy to set up, took about 5 minutes to do! Awesome picture, speakers has a great sound to them as well. Remote is easy to use, keys are spread out, and located perfectly for use. Highly recommend. Got this one for my son's 1oth birthday for his bedroom.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "31-1/2\" screen measured diagonally from corner to corner\nVESA 100mm x 100mm compliant\n2,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio (2400:1 typical)\n1080p display\nDirect-lit LED backlighting", "Name": "SHARP LC-32LB150U 60HZ LED 1080p - 60Hz - HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41683VAGPgL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GUUSQ9G"}}
