It worked so great that when the offer to upgrade to the pro version for free came up,why wouldn't I jump at it? Don't guy & girls!!!! As soon as the pro installed,everything went to hell! Can't get anything but a blank screen where the channel list should be. App has gone nuts! Wants to force close constantly. Only channel is BBC. Tried uninstalling & reinstalling many times - no help. Please guys,fix the bugs!!!! I love this app & when it was working,I'd recommend it to everyone. Nothing like it available anywhere. My father always told me \"Don't fix it if it ain't broke\" Guys,just set the app download back to the original that worked! It was the best thing since sliced bread until you tried to fix it! It wasn't broke guys. Don't shoot yourself in the foot,make it work again!

I stumbled on this one, read many reviews, and decided to try it.  Wow. It's truly amazing.  Channel guide is clear but I have a few complaints.  First, no blocking the ads as far as I can see, and what's up with the subtitles in other languages?  I see no way on the settings menu to change the captions/subtitles option, so on some channels like HBO and a few others, I get subtitles in Spanish and other languages, with no way to stop the subtitles from appearing that I can see.  Weird.  Another weird thing is that some channels are running \"live\" on my Kindle, but many are not.  I thought it would be great if I was really tired, to go to bed and watch something I wanted to finish watching, but do it in bed while about to go to sleep.  But if it's not a streaming live connection to the channel, I don't see a way to do that.  But overall, this is really an amazing app to have.  I clicked onto HBO and to my happy surprise, there was Girl With The Dragon Tattoo playing. Maybe I'll get caught up on Homeland Season 2 if Showtime runs it as a marathon or something.  Hey...this thing is free, so take advantage if you can.  I have not seen a problem with buffering the way others have, btw.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Average... just. Could be better.", "Author": "TOLEDO BLAND, OR NOT?", "ReviewID": "R3N5SSV1V0GM0K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Love the idea of this app. It's just like USTV Now, but for devices, and without the fee.There are some pluses and minuses. Let's start at the pluses.Pluses: - Get a few cable channels, no cost. - See what's happening in Tamps, Miami, Austin and Harrisburg, with their local TV network channels in those DMA's (ABC, NBC, CBS, CW and FOX). Locations as of 3/06/13, which could change. - Channels don't usually drop out, like on digital broadcast TV... and may include networks not in your own DMA (TV area) - Usable in most public WiFi placesMinuses: - No local stations unless you are in the above listed places. - Low quality picture. below 480i. Low definition pictures. Cannot read fine print in commercial spots. - Most channels are offline ALL OF THE TIME. These channels are still listed in the channel menu. - Channels are not listed in any logical order. Note that all of the local TV networks are on the bottom. - Notes of channels fixed does not mean they will work. - Prompt for upgrade doesn't explain an upgrade payment. For example, whom takes the payment via credit card, if one time or multi-pay (monthly/yearly), and where the company that operates this app's location, to research prior to app upgrade. Aka, shady area that may inhibit upgrades. You will be prompted about 2 minutes after changing channels. I do advise you check into the \"Upgrade\" a time or two to see what I mean. - a few double listings of channels.Some channels are not specified as to a language. For example, Nickelodeon is English on feed 1 and Nick Jr. in Spanish on feed 2. For those who love Nick @ Nite... take note of this... when it's actually on. - On some channels... LOTS of buffering. - Lots of channels listed that no longer work. - On CBS, Fox News, TBS, and a few other channels... the audio drifts off 30 seconds or more. Some audio is not i synch, as it should be. I have emailed this issues a few times now... without \"support\" response. - As listed above, no support reply on emailed issues. They could let one know they are working on the issue. Bad sign from the get  go. How they act for the free version shows how they will act for the paid upgrade, since you are \"auditioning\" the product and customer support. You will be prompted to upgrade 2 minutes after watching a new channel. - Product now has a new scroll (with lots of misspellings) on their other apps, when you change to a new channel. You see this in lime green font, scrolling on the top.Overall, It has allot to get better. I admit that I am using the free product, so the paid version MIGHT (but not confirmed) be better. I do wonder why they do not have the upgraded app here or on Google Play. That also looks fishy. Their site doesn't show it either.It is a wonderful idea... just needs some improvements and explanations. With these, I would be more than happy to use the product, if not upgrade. As the product is now, I can barely watch it. Expectations were not met on this one... at least not yet.------------------------------------------------------------------3/29/13 UPDATE: There were enhancements to the program, which include post-proccessing (good), got rid of the misspellings in the scroll - which is no longer present, brightness, etc. All good changes. However, now some of the  stations are all jumpy. Take SFL CW Miami (Channel 39.1), abc in Tampa (local Channel 28.1).... and a few channels will jump about and be twitchy. This is all the time on those channels. It's also not on all of them. Some channels are clean and not jumpy. Still at least 3/4 or more of those stations that are listed are offline. This needs to be remedied! Still audio/video synch drifting on some (listed above) and stations that are noted as fixed, are not fixed. Also, favorites are lost when you close the program/app. However, it now shows favorites, where it didn't before. Slight improvement... but still a ways to go. One note is that they removed a channel (Bloomberg) due to cease and desist order, by the channel.4/07/13 update:  Channels are off-center. This app maker appears to not check their work. The video is supposed to be \"center cut\" to 4x3. However, that center cut cuts off 1/3 of the picture on the right side. With this in mind, phone numbers get cut off. For example, \"local 10 news alert\" was displayed, but it said \"Local 10 newsal\" minus the \"ert\" The pictures are also still jerky... and quite a few channels are buffering every few seconds. These issues do not depend on post processing, hardware acceleration, etc. They all happened with all of those settings changed.Clearly, this is not run by professional engineers/programmers.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Application", "Author": "Carlos Vasquez", "ReviewID": "RHKQSUADF6OTY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall it's a great app with plenty of available channels.

I actually liked it.The basis for the app was to give Americans traveling abroad a chance to watch live TV content from back home in the States.Watching live teliviusion after getting rid of my expensive cable was a real treat. The service was ok but at times lost signal or the channel for the website wouldn't  find not connect .atthisx point I would bed given a 6 out of10 rating, now maybe it was for,that new car smell,and eventually I would've rated differently avefter the novelty wore off ,but I was satisfied.

I received an alert to update the app, so I did. to my surprisewhen I updated it had Amazon assocaited with the new app. I thought ,Excellent!

Minimal buffering.  Are some channels not available at certain times?  Yes, but it's free. Does it buffer every so often on 4m DSL?  Occasionally.  But it's free.  Is there a channel guide?  No. But it's free.  It's not supposed to replace your $60+ cable or satellite service.If this app won't run on your device, then yes, I don't blame anyone for giving it a bad review.  After all, you downloaded something that you can't use.

But on the flipside, there are quality channels like HBO, Starz, Animal Planet, Discovery and Lifetime, and the good news is that you don't have to pay for the premium channels like HBO and Starz.

Even though there are a lot of channels in this app that I will probably never watch, the fact that the app is FREE and includes some channels that my cable company would charge me for, I can't complain.  The only reason I'm not giving this app five stars is because there's no program listing for the channels.  You can't click on a channel and see a list of what programs are showing and what times they're showing, so there's a very high probability that when you click on a channel, you'll be in the middle of a program and won't even know what the movie or program is.

Recently they updated so some channels I was having problems with are working now :). The premium channels; most are broadcast from foreign countries, language in english with foreign subs (no need for Xfinity, HBO Go and whatever apps require current cable or satellite subscriptions). Actually there are quite a few channels like this. Your paid upgrade is for one device only, it doesn't transfer to any other device you have this on. It's only $1.99 for upgrade and that's valid for 1 year (pretty damn good price even if it were to be paid monthly!). I've yet to see any \"free Promo Codes\" that they said they do infrequently. I wish they said what regions the channels came from so you could figure out when something would be on. Also whenever I leave the app on my tablet it erases all my favorites but on my phone it has no effect. You can add channels to streaming live feed or request channels (not sure how long it takes for them to get the channel if it's a possibility). They seem to fix problems in a timely manner.

I think if I had paid for it I might have knocked one star off my review. The app is not perfect and there are some channels that don't work. However for me it has been great. We got rid of cable a few years ago and just went with Netflix streaming and also Amazon Instant Video. Between those two there are tons and tons of shows and movies to watch. However my kids do still miss getting to watch things like Disney Channel. Well with this App they are able to watch it and again it's free.So far we've watched Disney,HBO,USA,A&E;, and what seems to be an all Tom & Jerry all the time channel. These channels have all come in awesome for us. There are many channels that just don't work but I really don't care because I didn't even have to pay for this. If they do work at some point that's great, if not oh well.Another thing to mention is there are quite a few of the channels that are in Spanish which was a bummer for us. There are two Nickelodeon channels but both are in Spanish. However this could obviously be a great thing for others so I'm not knocking it for that reason. It would be great if they could include an English Nickelodeon channel.So I say all in all you can not go wrong with this app unless you are a very picky person that expects the world for nothing. We've used this on our first gen Kindle Fire and it's been great for our whole family. Go into this with fair expectations and I think you'll be pleased.

It can be buggy at times and either freeze up on ya or buffers a lot, but it manages to pull through most of the time.  In short, this app has potential and the makers of it are constantly at work to fix broken channels with occasional announcements of fixed and newly added channels.  Some people have even reported that they have requested new channels to be added to the list and their requests have been granted rather quickly.  I have yet to try this.
