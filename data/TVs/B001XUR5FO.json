Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R2COHGJT687PQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When it comes to TVs in the living room, bigger is always better so, when time came to replace our 61\" Samsung DLP I had no idea what my next TV was going to be, other than it was going to be bigger and that, of course, I was going to afford it. Mitsubishi's WD-73737 was the easy winner and this is why:- SIZE - well, 73\" is bigger than 61\", right? As far as I know, there aren't too many LCD or plasma TVs this  big, at least not anything that I can afford. Our living room is rather large - it's really most of our first floor (open style architecture) so it helps to have a big screen. Mitsubishi makes an 82\" model but I had also to consider...- PRICE - we have a clear winner here. When it comes to price/size ratio, DLP's are by far the least expensive option.- ENERGY EFFICIENCY - according to my research, the WD-73737 burns about 265W when 'on' (this includes the 180W lamp). By comparison, a 70\" LCD needs 540-630W to operate.- 3D CAPABILITY - it's a potential plus. Mitsubishi does not guarantee that its TV will be compliant with whatever 3D standard is about to emerge but... it might.Of course, not everything is perfect so, here are the potential 'minuses':- LAMP - when it comes to 'cost of ownership', we must factor in the DLP's lamp. The Mitsubishi manual expects its lamp to last for about one year but our Samsung was still okay after 2 years with the original lamp so, we shall see. A replacement for this model, direct from Mitsubishi is $99 and I will get a free one under warranty if the original needs replacement before one year. Given the great energy savings when compared to an LCD TV, I am not too worried about having to replace the lamp from time to time.- BULK - this set is over 90 lbs. heavy and over 12\" at its thickest. Definitely, can't hang it on a wall. Therefore...- STAND - you must have one. We are using the one that came with the old 61\" and all is fine but if you don't have one it should set you back a few more hundred bucks.- THE SCREEN - nothing wrong with it but, when compared with our old Samsung, this is just a little more reflective. It's not so to the point of being annoying at night if lights are on in the room but sometimes it is noticeable.Since we already had a stand, didn't want to hang a 73\" TV on the wall and the need to replace the lamp was compensated by its energy savings, we went for the WD-73737 without hesitation and we are happy we did.OUR SETUPA TV this size would normally be used in a home theater setting and, it turns out, that's how we use it. We have a satellite TV box, a PS3, dedicated Blu-ray player a 7.1 surround receiver and a Harmony 900 remote. The TV comes with LOTS of inputs, including 3 HDMI but, in our case, the setup started with plugging the TV into the power outlet, connecting the HDMI cable into one of TV's HDMI ports and, since I had the Harmony 900 already configured to handle the TV, that was IT, we were watching TV within 5 minutes of it coming out of the box.Later own, we did some fine tuning but, it turns out, very little had to be adjusted. We made sure that the frame rate was set to 120 fps and, for the rest, we took the recommended settings from the Tweak TV site and didn't have to change too much from what they recommended. We ended up with:Picture Mode: NaturalColor Temperature: LowAspect Ratio: StandardContrast: 55Brightness: 36Color: 31Tint: 31Sharpness: 31Deep Field Imager: OffSuper Resolution: OffSharp Edge: OffVideo Noise: OffThe end-result is as close to picture-prefect as they come.I have nothing to say about the sound - it can simulate 'surround' with its own speakers - because we are not using it. Same when it comes to channel tuning or setting up 'activities'. These are fully handled by the satellite receiver and the Harmony remote but all the capabilities are there. Same when it comes to the remote which is quite small - a nice thing - but it may take some getting used to when it comes to the buttons size (small) and their layout.WARRANTYOn an object this size, this is an important concern so, here's what matters:- The screen is only covered for 30 (THIRTY) days.- The picture quality warranty states that Mitsubishi will fix it if you get less than 99.99% of the pixels right. In other words, you should have at least 9,999 out of 10,000 pixels right. On a 2-million pixel screen this means that if you have up to 199 bad pixels, Mitsubishi is not obligated to fix your TV.- Everything else is covered for one year.- The lamp will be replaced free of charge if it needs replacement within the first year.- Service is provided 'in house' IF you are within the coverage of an authorized Mitsubishi center. If you're not, you will be responsible for taking your TV there so you better check you are inside a Mitsubishi service area.__________________________________[Note on warranty - Nov. 12, 2010]I had to call Mitsubishi because the lamp had to be replaced. Within minutes, I was on the phone with a competent person who, after asking that I reset the TV and me confirming that the picture was still dim agreed to send me a replacement lamp under the warranty. I provided the TV's serial number and date of purchase, my address and my phone number. He promised that the replacement lamp will be shipped within 2-5 business days.A few days later, the lamp arrived. I called Mitsubishi's warranty dept. about me returning the used lamp but they asked me not to bother. I trust and respect a company that trusts and respects its customers.__________________________________MY RATINGThis TV delivers exactly what I wanted and expected: a large, bright, crisp picture that, thanks to the 120 fps display has very little blur on fast moving objects. The drawbacks: need to replace the lamp, unorthodox layout on the remote, bulk are either counterbalanced by other features or did not matter much in my case. Not everyone could live with a TV that's not totally flat or that needs a stand but if the main concerns are picture quality, price, size and energy consumption, this TV is hard to beat.I will grant the WD-73737 5 stars because I own it and I am very happy with it.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "73\" 737 series", "Author": "Lafcadio", "ReviewID": "R3OZVFQBRL7AE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just bought a 73\" 737series a couple of weeks ago.

Linton", "ReviewID": "R1MQWFDXHTWP9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is great.  I was looking at LCD and DLP TVs, and the DLP offer bigger screens and the same great picture at a lower price. HDTV, Blu-Ray, DVD, etc all look great on this TV.  1080p resolution is amazing, I have an older 52 inch HDTV, which displays 1080i and this DLP looks 10 times better.Out of the box, this DLP is very color rich, especially in the reds and yellows, which I easily corrected using the PerfectPicture Menu.  I toned down all colors by 5 and the red and yellow by 10.  This made the picture look a lot better.I am using various types of connections on it (HDMI, Component, and Composite) and each input delivers a great picture.  I use the HDMI to connect my PS3, component cables connect my Dish receiver and DVD player, and the composite cable connects the Wii.  This TV automatically recognizes when devices are connected and allows you to name each connnection.You can't go wrong with this one.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "There are Cheaper TV's with Better Picture and Dont Require Regular Maintenance IE Buying Lamps (added cost)", "Author": "JM Delgado", "ReviewID": "RP9H3PQZ52KZT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV for 1 year and 7 months(purchase date Dec 6 2009). The lamp blew out today July 20th 2011. The warranty last for one year. when I called the company they said that I needed to purchase a replacement lamp at the cost of $99 dollars plus Shipping and Handling. I asked if that lamp had a warranty after I pay $99 dollars the tech person told me yes but only 90days(3 Months). My next question to the tech person what is the average life of the lamp that people were calling in to replace and she said that the lamps blow up(fails) as early as 9 months(270 days) and the longest it will last if not used everyday is 2 years at most if your lucky(Their words). So if you buy this product get ready to pay $100 in maintenance every 9 months. I paid $2100 for this TV. My girlfriend bought a 47 inch Sharp LCD for $800 1/3 of what I paid and the picture isnt as grainy as my 737 series Mitsubishi 73 inch DLP HDTV, its actually clearer. This was the worst buy I have ever done. If I had it to do it over i wouldnt have spent the equivalent of a down payment of a car on this TV, I would find the biggest LCD or LED that was not a Mitsubishi. Mitsubishi customer care is horrid too, they do nothing for you but take your money and tell you how a lamp is a retail product for consumers. After reading that they have stop making lamps for their older models I was not surprised, just sad that I will most likely have to throw this TV away in another 3years too. If you like hidden cost and bad customer service then buy the 737 series Mitsubishi 73 inch DLP HDTV. If I saw someone stealing the 737 series Mitsubishi 73 inch DLP HDTV off the back of a truck I would stop them. I am 28 years old and Mitsubishi has lost me as a customer for life.

It has an excellent picture (although I did upgrade to HD after I bought it). Why have such a beautiful TV in SD anyway? The picture in SD was not bad, although any text on the screen did appear a little fuzzy. The graphics look awesome on the XBOX, PS3 and even the Wii.Setup is a breeze. The TV recognizes anything you plug into it immediately and switching from one device to another is easy.When I bought mine, I also purchased a 5 year protection plan. From what I have heard and read, the warrenty from Mitsubishi is not that great and reguires you to ship the TV to them if anything goes wrong. I sure would hate to try to box up something this size, so I opted for a plan where if anything goes wrong, they will come to me and fix it. Furthermore, I get all the lamp replacements I need during the 5 years for free (lamps last from 6 months to 2 years). Two lamp replacements alone will pay for my warrenty.One thing that I was told about the DLP's is you have to be careful when powering on and off. I was told that once the TV is turned off the lamp will need about 15 minutes to cool before it can be powered on safely. Powering on too quickly will shorten the lamp life.I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase, but I would definately recommend getting a better warranty with bulb replacement. The only thing better than watching this TV is knowing that if anything goes wrong in the next five years, it will get taken care of.In fact, after 2 weeks of owning this model we bought one in the 60\" size for our den!", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Picture in HD is incredible", "Author": "Explorer777", "ReviewID": "R2NHDHXAQHITEN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to wait for a few months before writing a review.  After about 4 months, we are very happy with the picture quality in HD, even with the reviews it surpassed my expectations.  If your not used to it, even the commercials are amazing to watch in HD on this TV.  We used to have a Samsung 61 inch DLP that was about 5 years old.  The color wheel went on it and I could have easily replaced the wheel, but I was not pleased with the HD quality on the older TV.  After hooking up the new TV, we were all amazed at the difference.  There are however 2 things about this TV that kept it from getting 5 stars.  The first is that there are not as many inputs as there were on my older Samsung.  This surprised me because everyone I know now has a ton of things to plug into the back including DVR's, PS3's, DVD players, Camera's, etc.  There is also no input for S-Video, which really annoyed me at first until I found a work around for my video camera.  The other area that annoys me with this TV is the volume.  If you have not adjusted the volume for a few minutes, when you do, you get an hour glass on the screen for about 3 seconds before the volume then goes up or down.  Even with these short comings, I would definitely buy this TV again.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just do it!", "Author": "D. Duren \"jock woodworker\"", "ReviewID": "RYTWLS19PLDPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Replaced a 57\" Hitachi with this TV. Read and researched for several months. I've seen a LOT of TV's and this one is great. Going up in size makes the difference between having a \"big TV\" and having real home theater. HD channels on this one are great, even SD channels are good. Not sure what the complaints were about the sound/speakers, but I have no issue with them. I have home theater setup just for movies, and watch \"regular TV\" thru the TV speakers with no problem.Advice here is to measure your room and get the DIMENSIONS of whatever TV you buy. Most people buy and wish they went bigger. Also affects the height of whatever you put the TV on. I build furniture and used those dimensions to get my stand proper height. Nothing worse then getting a TV and feeling its too small.For the money, this is a GREAT deal. Awesome picture and half the price of plasma. Plenty of features. Pre-wire your components and the delivery setup takes about 5 minutes. If you have the room, this is the way to go for the money.Funny but despite researching for months what finally sold me was a trip to the new Yankee Stadium.

After making small adjustments to the picture settings, I'm getting a better picture than on a front-projection setup. Brightness, contract, and black levels are good. Colors seem natural and not overly-juiced (a common problem on TVs).I have a hard time recommending it for PC usage. It's unclear if it's possible to get a true :1 pixel mapping (disabling geometry correction in the service menu allegedly does this). Significant overscan (3%+) hides the edges of the Windows desktop. There are slight inconsistencies in focus/geometry that become apparent when using as a computer display. There's no VGA input, and over HDMI, the display doesn't sync in all PC video modes; the 720x480 text mode and HDTV resolutions (1080p) display; other screens during the Windows boot process (640x480 VGA) don't appear at all.If you run Media Center on your HTPC, this TV is fine because Media Center avoids using the edges of the screen.

Sound quality lacks as in-built speakers are ordinary and low power. You would need external sound system for good affects. Couple of shortcomings that are inherent to DLP to know:1. Takes 10-60 seconds of warm-up time after power off/on, then slowly brightness grows.2. Lamp has limited life and needs changing every few years depending on usage.3. Has no VGA/SVGA port. This is my biggest pain point as my use of computer is growing and I did not realize connectivity will be such a big issue. There are no good SVGA conversion or adapters available off the market. I tried many and they don't work. The only one worked was a VGA to HDMI converter at $50 cost. That too with low resolution defeating the purpose of such a high quality TV.

The only thing i would suggest for Mitsubishi to add is some kind of discount of some sort for the 3d kit to purchase with it. As once spending this money on a tv, you sometimes feel too guilty to go out and spend the extra money for any kind of expansion kit, and if youre going to buy this kind of tv, you might as well go all out and enjoy it for its full and true potential. I have yet to purchase the 3d expansion kit and glasses and player and etc.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Completely Satisfied!!!", "Author": "Vivonell Brown", "ReviewID": "R2KHWLY1LL4SRP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't be happier with delivery of my new 73' Mitsubishi DLP television that I recently purchased through Amazon.  The television is simply fantastic.  The picture is so clear and sharp.  I really can't describe it to you.  You'll just have to see it for yourself.This is the second time I bought a Mitsubishi DLP through Amazon.  The first set was a 60' DLP.  I gave that set to my mother, so I could justify buying an even larger one.Why did I buy my firt set from Amazon?  Well, I intially tried to buy the set at Bestbuy, but they only wanted to sell me a smaller set for thousands of dollars more.  The salesman couldn't seem to find the set in the store or in the ware house, so I thought I would buy it on line.  It took only a few minutes to identify the set on Amazon and a few minutes more to purchase it.  The delivery took place on time.  The guy who delivered the set even placed it in the elevator and carried it into my appartment.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "3 Years Later.....", "Author": "Edward M.

Another screen the same size or close would cost several thousand dollars more.  So for the price the display was awsome.  The sound isn't so great, at higher levels the speakers buzz a bit.  Now that HDMI has really taken off the 3 HDMI ports in the back and 1 in the front have come in handy.  Unfortunately the inner workings of the TV has problems with a reciever placed on the TV to allow switching between HDMI components.  I googled the issue and found that others had the same issue and complained about Mitsubishi's support. I had a good experience with them.  I did use one suggestion I read on line and told the rep I had a professional repair person come out to look at the TV and that they said call maker and get a firmware upgrade.  From what I read if you don't do this they will not send you the firmware.  Firmware is suppose to be delievered today, one odd thing, the rep said after I installed the firmware, I had to send it back to them.  Which is fine, if the firmware fixes my issue I'll be enjoying my big TV with surround sound and loving life!!  Oh another thing, the bulb is only suppose to last a year or two.  I haven't replaced mine as of yet and still have a great picture.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Taliercio Alexandre", "ReviewID": "R7KFY2G9U8IVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this TV last year as a christmas present for our parents.

Picture is smooth and sharp, with great color and vibrance.  The darn thing only weighs 90 pounds (down from 250 or so just 3 years ago).  Am actually looking forward to football season with this bad boy!  I looked at LED, LCD and Plasma formats, but the truth is the pictures were not really better (brighter maybe, but not better) and so now I have a 73\" for what I would have paid for a 60\" or 55\" in other formats.  Overall, unless you need to hang a television on a wall, this is definitely the way to go!Only real disappointment (once I figured out the controller which is not user friendly) was that the telvision does not have a head phone jack to plug in wireless headphones.  I really wanted to be able to use wireless headphones while on the treadmill in front of this television, but I will come up with a Plan B.Buy and enjoy!!", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "DLP for me", "Author": "2knarf", "ReviewID": "R28JA8W65LUM46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome TV.

The price was fantastic, so regardless of any perceived drawbacks, you can't pass up a 73\" 1080p DLP 120Hz 3D television for the price that is being offered on Amazon. The picture is beyond amazing. The color and detail is even better than my 40\" Samsung 1080p LCD. I was very curious as to see how the picture would turn out on action movies and sports games in HD - and I couldn't be happier as the picture remains clean and smooth throughout. This review is a little incomplete as I have not been able to test out the 3D capability just yet, but since the rest of the TV has exceeded my expectations, I'm very hopeful that the 3D option will do the same.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Mitsubishi Service Center", "Author": "D.

Called Mitsubishi Customer Service Center twice.  Both times the customer service reps seems somewhat confused as to what to try other than pushing the reset button on front of TV or putting HDMI in plug two.  The representatives also did not have a very good grasp of the English language.  Finally sent an email to the company and their response was to call an authorized service center.  I live in a rather large city but the only authorized service center is 49 miles away and only works certain hours in the week.  Seems a little strange Mitsubishi wouldn't have a service rep closer and more of them  in a large city.  Waiting for a call back from the service rep.
