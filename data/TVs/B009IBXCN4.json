When you turn the volume up, the right side goes in and out, making the sound quality bothersome. The TV was supposed to have been brand new, but I think it was either a refurbished or returned item. That's why I'm not sure who to blame - (the seller or the manufacturer).Another thing is that the USB port can read most file formats, unlike other TVs with USB ports. For some reason it's unable to stream videos from my PC, but I can stream music and pictures though.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value in a small TV", "Author": "Paul L Smith", "ReviewID": "R1LMHT4DN7FCP8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my office and it works fine.
