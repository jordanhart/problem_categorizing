{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellet TV overall, Oustanding when viewed from front and center", "Author": "SGatefield", "ReviewID": "RT55BAX80BJKV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As of this writing (Sept. 25, 2011), I've had the Sony XBR-55HX929 for just over two months, so I thought it was about time I shared my impressions of it. Nothing I have to say differs significantly from what other (positive) reviews have said, but I thought I'd contribute to the collective wisdom.Let me start off with a bit of context: I have had, at least briefly, five HDTVs since March 2011: a 62\" Mitsubishi WD-62525 (a rear projection TV with 720p native resolution), a Panasonic TC-P55ST30 (plasma), a Samsung PN59D6500 (also a plasma), a Samsung UN55D6900 (an LED edge-lit LCD), and the Sony XBR-55HX929 (LED backlit LCD with local dimming). The Mitsubishi died in late March and I have been searching for a replacement. As you can see, I've tried out just about the full array of TV technologies. My search has ended with the Sony XBR-55HX929, and I am very happy with it. I will compare the Sony with some of the other sets I've had below.There are a number of concerns that owners or prospective owners of the Sony have had, so let me address those. First, the build date. I ordered my set from Amazon.com on July 9, it shipped on the 13th and was delivered the 20th. It was assembled in Mexico in March 2011.The dreaded \"crease\": Yes, mine has the crease (a slightly darker \"line\" that appears along the sides of the image on many of these Sonys, usually on the left and right, but sometimes along the top and bottom edges, about an inch in from the bezel). I have fairly faint creasing on both the left and right sides. It seems a bit darker towards the bottom of the screen.However: I agree with many owners and contributors to discussion forums that under normal viewing circumstances--when you are watching \"real content\" rather putting up a uniform (or nearly uniform) field of color for inspection purposes--I never notice it. My wife has never noticed it, nor has anyone who has come over to see the set. I can see it on the PS3's home screen, but that hardly bothers me. It surprises me a bit that I say this, since I am quite picky and minor imperfections often irritate me to no end (this is one reason I've gone through all the sets mentioned above!). If I could see it when I viewed typical content, I'd return the set. But I don't. As it is now, I wouldn't dream of returning the set.So, my view is that the \"crease\" issue should not deter you from getting the Sony XBR-HX929. If you don't need a new set right away, by all means wait a couple of months and perhaps there will be a reliable stream of crease-free sets (though a recent comment from Sony UK has me somewhat doubtful). If you must buy now, I don't think the crease should scare you away from this set. (Well... I'm a bit torn about this actually: Despite what Sony UK has recently said, the crease is probably a manufacturing defect, and a top-of-the-line item shouldn't have manufacturing defects. So, I can sympathize with those who do not want to give Sony money for releasing a very expensive product with such a defect.)Like some others, I am planning to put a call it to Sony to report the crease. The more they hear about it, the more likely they are to do something. Also, if there is a recall, or an offer to replace sets with the crease, etc., I would certainly be interested in taking Sony up on that.Picture quality: I'm using David Katzmaier's (from CNET) recommended settings. Viewed from straight on, front and center, at eye level, the picture is outstanding (4.5 or 5 out of 5 stars). The blacks are truly black--deep, inky, and virtually indistinguishable from the bezel, especially when you view from a high-quality source like a Blu-ray. It is the only TV of those I've owned with blacks as deep as the Panasonic plasma's. These deep blacks make for excellent contrast, which (along with strong shadow detail and good gamma) gives the image natural depth and that \"pop\" that impresses viewers so much.Colors are both rich and realistic. Shadow detail is excellent. Blu-ray movies I've watched on this set so far include Toy Story 3, Baraka, Master and Commander, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and Rango. All looked absolutely fantastic (though I give the overall nod to Toy Story 3). Best in-home theater experiences I've ever had. I am consistently \"wow-ed\" by the picture on this set.Comparison with the Samsung UN55D6900 LCD. The colors on the Samsung were excellent (once I got the user-adjustable settings right--which is relatively easy on the Samsung thanks to its RGB-only mode: one of the things I like better about Samsung than the Sony). Still, the Sony's are at least as good (I didn't do a side-by-side, simultaneous comparison, so it is difficult to say for sure which was better). However, there is one area in which the Sony clearly and, in my view, crucially bests the Samsung. The Samsung is an edge-lit LED-LCD (as are all of the upper end Samsung LCDs), which means that the LEDs that provide the light for the TV's picture shine in from the edges of the set--parallel to the surface of the screen/LCD. Like many owners of Samsung's LCDs (see user forums), I was really bothered by the flashlighting (when light from the LEDs bleeds into a corner of the image), clouding (areas of the screen that appear lighter than they should) and generally uneven dark-scene performance exhibited by this set. The Sony's full-array LED backlighting (in which the light producing LEDs are arranged behind the screen, shining light perpendicular to the surface of, or out through, the LCD screen) with local dimming is superior in this regard, hands down. Even my wife agrees. (Though she didn't think the improvement was worth the heftier price tag. Obviously I disagreed!) Using the PLUGE pattern on the DVE calibration disc, I could never get the 2%-above-black bars on either side of the central gray-scale bar to be equally visible on the Samsung--when the one to the left of the center gray scale was just visible, the one on the right wouldn't be. To improve this, I had to crank up the brightness, which improved shadow detail, but (obviously) hurt black levels. No such problem on the Sony. Both +2% bars are equally visible while the blacks stay black and shadow detail is preserved.Viewing angles: A weakness, and one of the reasons I don't give the set a 5-star rating. The Sony cannot compete with the Panasonic or Samsung plasmas on this aspect of picture quality. Still, the viewing angles are not as bad as I feared from reading reviews and some other user comments. The picture washes out worst as you move away from front-and-center when the material is dark, but from my usual viewing distance of about 10 feet, I can sit on either side of my couch (a three-cushion, 6.5ft couch) and notice very little change in the picture. I would say that viewing angles are comparable to the Samsung LCD (though I didn't do extensive tests on this--I was primarily concerned with screen uniformity when comparing these). For something like sports on ESPN, and most cable/ local broadcasts, I can walk from one side of the room to the other without any bothersome loss of picture quality.Blooming (a \"halo\" of light that shouldn't be there surrounding a bright object on a dark background): It happens, but again, not as bad as I feared. (It is worth noting that some blooming is virtually unavoidable on LED backlit LCD televisions.) With actual viewing material (blu-rays, dvd movies), viewed from front center, I observe infrequent blooming. Blooming is really only apparent on end credits, and images like PS3 pause and quit screens, but that hardly matters to me.Now, off-angle blooming is a different story. Not only does the screen wash out if you view from too far off-center, blooming becomes significant. Bad enough that it is another reason I don't give the set 5 stars. The moral: watch from front and center when you want that ultimate home theater experience!The edge-lit Samsung LCD didn't exhibit blooming to the same degree, even off angle--but I'll take the off angle and credit-screen blooming over flashlighting and clouding problems. (They are related problems, actually: all result when light from the LEDs shows up where it shouldn't.)Plasmas don't (or shouldn't) exhibit blooming, so again, the clear advantage goes to the Samsung and Panasonic plasmas on this aspect of picture quality.Dirty Screen Effect (uneven picture uniformity during pans that makes it look like there is something on the screen--sort of like a thin film of dirt): Yes, I notice it occasionally, but mainly on standard definition and pseudo-HD sources like Netflix streaming. I didn't notice it on any of the blu-ray movies I watched (see above).Video games/response time: My test material is Zen Pinball on the PS3. Good response times are important for this game (though not as much as for fighting games), since you want the \"paddles\" to move the instant you hit the shoulder buttons. Response time is good. Significantly better than on the Samsung LCD. I would say it is comparable or perhaps just slightly worse than the Panasonic plasma, though this is a memory-based judgment of which I am not terribly confident, so take it for what it is worth. Also: none of these sets were on Game Mode. I have local dimming set to Standard on the Sony. Response times are improved with local dimming set to Off and when the set is put in Game Mode. Nevertheless, I'm perfectly happy with the response times, even with local dimming On (the picture is better this way).Appearance: I think this is an awesome-looking set. The monolithic design, with the single sheet of glass from edge to edge is really cool. It is better looking than either plasma (the Panasonic has the most boring design), no question. It's a tough call between the Sony and the Samsung LCD. I thought the Samsung was also very good looking. It's a toss up, and I could see someone going either way. The Samsung is a bit flashier, a bit sexier, with the super-thin bezel and clear strip of plastic around the edge, but the Sony has a more refined, sophisticated look to it. I do wish you could turn off the green \"on\" light though... I don't need to be told that the set is on when there is an image on the screen!Reflectiveness: This was a pleasant surprise. CNET's review had me concerned that it would be very reflective, but it isn't. It is significantly less reflective than the Samsung LCD. It is similar to the Panasonic plasma. Can you see reflections? Yes, absolutely.  But they are dull, muted and rather faint, despite the fact that I have two fairly large windows on the south-facing side of my 12'x10' living room (perpendicular to the direction the TV faces).Table-top stand: Yes, the TV wobbles when it is on the stand and you swivel the TV. I think any \"single-stalk\" swivel stand, as is also used by Samsung, will allow the TV to wobble. But unlike some others, I have no significant \"tilting\" or \"listing\" of the TV on the stand. Use a level when you put the stand together, check it when you put the TV on the stand, and only tighten the screws when you have it level (it can help to have another person hold the TV in the level position. You should be able to get it very level this way. The stand is much better than the Samsung's stand (I did have issues with the Samsungs, both the LCD and the plasma, being level) and it is made of tougher material. The Panasonic plasma was the sturdiest of the bunch, by far (but the Panasonic's stand was not a swivel stand, so...).Remote: I think the Sony remote is good. A little bulky, but the buttons are nicely arranged and on the whole it is very functional. The concave top really does guide your thumb naturally to the all-important central \"enter\" button. I like the dedicated Netflix button too--there's no easier way to watch Netflix: just two button pushes (\"TV On\" then \"Netflix\")!3D: I haven't used 3D on this TV yet, so I cannot comment. Reviews such as CNET's suggest that 3D is not this set's strong suit, and user forums don't do much to refute this. I do think it is ridiculous that Sony doesn't include a pair of 3D glasses, especially given the price of this TV. Which brings me to...Price: Prices have come down lately, and with the LG LW9800 and the Sharp Elite hitting the streets, it is no longer the most expensive consumer television in its category. But none of this changes the fact that this is a really expensive television. It is the most expensive I've had, and I never intended to spend this much. The Panasonic and Samsung plasmas offer much better value, in my opinion, while the uniformity issues with the Samsung LCD keep it from being a good value.Other: Some folks have complained about the organization/ ease of use of the menu systems, but I actually find the menus pretty sensible (of course, I'm used to the basic set up since I have a PS3, so...). Internet content is solid. Unlike some others, I have been able to use the browser--but it is quite slow and I prefer to do my browsing on a computer or an iPad anyway. It would be nice if Sony added the vTuner internet radio, as Samsung did, but this is a very minor complaint. Samsung offers the best suite of Internet options, in my opinion. But more importantly (for me), the Sony handles streaming video (e.g., Netflix) better than the Samsung LCD did. Streaming video often had significant \"stutter\" on the Samsung. To get rid of it I had to use motion smoothing, which resulted in the dreaded \"soap opera effect\", which I hate. True, I was able to tweak the settings to get it to look right, but the constant tweaking I was doing on the Samsung LCD was itself a problem. The Sony handles Internet content well in my preferred settings (and sometimes automatically shifts to a different setting, which also works well, then automatically returns to my custom setting when, for instance, I pop in a blu-ray).I have been very happy with how well the Sony works with my AV receiver--a Pioneer VSX-1021-K. The HDMI ARC works flawlessly (it was hit-or-miss with the Samsung LCD), and the Sony automatically turns the AVR on when I turn it on (doesn't automatically turn it off though), which is convenient. I never had to do anything to get it to do that (other than connect the two devices via their ARC-capable HDMI ports).I think that about covers it. Overall, the Sony XBR-55HX929 is an excellent TV. I initially wanted a plasma, but unfortunately I see \"phosphor trails\" when I watch plasmas (yellow after images/ flashes when I move my eyes or when a light object moves across a dark background) and I'm sensitive to the 60Hz refresh rate that Panasonic plasmas use, so no plasma for me. I'm happy to have found an LCD with a comparable, and in some ways better, picture--as long as you watch from front and center!Is this TV for you? It depends. First, you need to decide whether you want to get an LCD or a plasma. Many plasmas provide comparable or better overall picture quality for much less money. The Panasonic TC-P55ST30, for instance, is nearly as good as this Sony on black levels and color, while being clearly superior with respect to blooming and viewing angles, yet costs about half the price. But if you have a very bright room, or don't want to take reasonable precautions to avoid plasma burn in, or insist on the most energy efficient devices, then an LCD is probably the way to go. In that case, if you've got the money, insist on top-notch picture quality, and you (and maybe one other person) can typically watch TV from front and center, then you will be very happy with the Sony XBR-55HX929.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Screen defects", "Author": "Gary", "ReviewID": "R2U505SRAOCWQH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "In sum, expect the beautiful display to be embarrassingly scarred after an inexcusably short amount of time, and then having to wait weeks for Sony to fix it. Picture looks great until screen fails - and it will.  I haven't had the TV longer than 90 days, and a blue vertical stripe has developed running the entire height of the screen.  I did some online research and this is a common problem.  For the price I paid, and it being the \"flagship\" of Sony's TVs, this is not acceptable.  Worse, the warranty repair won't even be scheduled for at least a week, and then who knows how long it will take before they can actually arrive and fix it (and the Sony phone rep disclosed that it will be another week if they have to order parts).  In the past, I had similar problems with a Sony XBR projection TV, when the optical blocks had issues and the screen had yellow blotches just within a year or two of use.  I should have learned my lesson then.  Sony's poor track record of quality on their high-end TV's will burn them in loss of customer loyalty.  Avoid this TV - not worth the price, shoddy quality, and hassle.  **UPDATE: SONY decided to send me a replacement TV rather than sending a repair person.  Per their manufacture's warranty agreement, SONY has the right to replace the TV with a referbished model, and that's exactly what the did.  There's a sticker on the back declaring it refirbished along with several minor scratches on the back of the unit. Worse, the lower frame of the TV bulges down on the left side - looks like it wasn't glued or set properly (flush) with the screen glass.  The TV also leans to the left on the stand by about a half inch, and there is noting I can do to fix it.  In sum, it took SONY weeks to replace the TV, and they did it with a scatch n' dent model. This is nowhere near acceptable for a TV of this price, bought new, and less than 90 days old.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding TV", "Author": "kcmurphy22", "ReviewID": "RKBX75FN9GSKI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited 4 months for the TV just to make sure I wasnt going to miss something in my search for a new TV. I'm glad I waited. As a disclaimer I will say that the 3D aspect of the features were insignificant to me and my wife. I just wanted the best 2D picture I could find and right now I dont even own any 3d glasses, so it was a minor issue. I had looked at all the models and it was between the Samsung 8000 and LG W6500 and perhaps the Sony if it measured up (as it was late in releasing). Alot of things to like on all three models and I had looked at the LG and Samsung 20 times. Head on the Samsung has an outstanding picture. Even with slight angles the color saturation dropped as did the blacks etc. The LG kept them much better and with the Passive 3d and lower price I was pretty sure thats what I would be buying but opted to wait for Sony just so I wouldnt kick myself later.I would have. Seen side by side, all three of them, there was simply no comaprison and even my wife who is very uninterested commented on how much nicer the over all picture was (all sets in the store were set on vivid with no other adjustments). With even steep angle viewing the Sony lost far less than the Samsung and even the LG. The full array makes a huge difference and from 30 ft away the Sony leapt out in clarity, depth with virtually no judder (shudder, blurring) or whatever they call it. Picture is phenominal. It is as clean and pretty shut off as a TV can be. The Gorilla glass is ver nice, you can just use a nice clean rag and glass cleaner and it comes out beautiful Also while opening a cd case two fell out of my hand and hit the front. Probably wouldnt have hurt anything else but not a mark.CONS: Why I gave it 4 stars and not five. The directions stink and I just generally figured stuff out and the \"internet\" side of it is very slow (but thats why I have a Mac). The stand which is well designed and suitably robust still has a potential flaw and mine sags ever so slightly to the right but apparently Sony is sending someone out to see it which is impressive as I dont think they have alot out there. Lastly, it's expensive and it was hard to justify almost a thousand more in comparison to the LG but to me the picture warranted the difference. To others possibly not. Overall I am glad I waited. Compare them if possible side by side, close your eyes and sign the check it's probably worth it!", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "More Than I Expected", "Author": "jhensen", "ReviewID": "R3RGD7BREXL65Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's hard to still be amazed after spending almost $3000 on a TV, but this television still has me just as impressed with it as much the first time I fired it up. I had been on the verge of buying a new 3D since Dec. 2010, almost snagging a Samsung UN46C7000 from Amazon for a sweet price the day before Chirstmas... Fortunately, I waited. I did as much research I could do through forums and local electronic stores, but it is impossible to get a true sense of a TV's capabilities without running your own content on them, so I really took a chance on Sony's flagship to deliver more than the competition and enough to justify the price tag. My first experience with the TV, after the general start-up settings of course, was throwing on the Legend of the Guardians 3D blu-ray. This is not only the best 3D experience I have had so far, but the single greatest movie experience I have ever had. Although the film itself has it's flaws, the level of detail and the fluidity of the 3D motion was breathtaking! It is the movie I show my buddies to show off what my TV and 3D itself is truly capable of. I have seen first generation Samsung 3D TV's in relative's houses and noticed a good deal of ghosting, something that I did not see the current generation fixing either, but this is virtually nonexistent on the Hx929. Blooming is an issue many have been having with Sony LED's for some time now, but I have not personally experienced this even though I watch it from off angles frequently. Another concern that has been put to rest was the response delay when playing video games. Gran Turismo 5, Crisis 2, and Killzone 3 all looked absolutely stunning, and no noticable delay or blurring even outside of \"Game Mode.\" I spent a couple hours fidling with with display settings that other owners and CNET have posted, but have found that I enjoy the preset settings \"Standard\" and \"Vivid\" the most. As far as pure picture quality goes, this is leaps and bounds better than my 2 year old Samsung plasma it replaced, and still offers more clarity and deeper blacks than the rest of the 2011 LED lineup. I have not used any of the internet browser or \"widgets,\" but my PS3 can run most, if not all, that the TV can offer with an easier to navigate XMB. I  can't vouch for the TV's built-in sound either, but I assume that they are underwhelming like most TV speakers these days. Anyone investing this much money into their home theater should pick up a decent sound bar at least. I have a Pioneer VSX-1020-K receiver with Sony front, side, and rear speakers (These are an incredible value!), and the whole package makes me miss my room whenever I am at the movie theater. Overall, if you are looking for the absolute best in HD/3D picture quality and are less concerned about the price at checkout, this is the best manufacturers have to offer. If you are looking for a good picture at a bargain price, the Samsung UND7000 or 8000 are probably more suitable. For myself, I was already going to spend about $2000 on a new TV, spending a few hundred more for the best available made more sense and I am happy that I did.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing set", "Author": "LA Bill \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "R3E2K97TU9AZMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is truly one of the top two sets currently available.

So when I read that they gave their Editor's Choice award to lesser Sony models, I was intrigued.  So much so that I purchased the 55\" HX820 because they said that the HX929 wasn't worth the extra money.  They were DEAD wrong.  Out of the box, I was immediately disappointed with the 820.  I have a 3 year old XBR 32\", and the picture quality is crystal clear.  Watching a football game, I immediately caught a slight blur with the 820 on a fast moving play.  And images of the field were grainy in comparison to the close ups (which were quite good).  I messed with the setting, but at the end of the day, I couldn't lie to myself anymore.  The picture quality wasn't that great.  Atleast when comparing to the 2 other XBR models I've owned (one of which being the CRT that picture quality nuts rave about).  So I ordered the HX929.  Out of the box, I was blown away.  Like smiling from ear to ear blown away.  Black levels are as good as advertised, and you can see an IMMEDIATE difference between the 820.  Trust me when I tell you ... I have these TVs side by side, and the difference is clear even to my wife who is far from the videophile that I've become.The Sony XBRHX929 is simply put one of the finest TVs out there.  I'm returning the HX820 immediately, and give credit to Amazon's return policy and the fact that someone will be coming to me to pick it up (a huge bonus).If you're looking for the best picture quality of any LED LCD, look no further.

I own a high end TV from Samsung also and I find their remote much better and the built in speakers were better also.  Lets face it though, if you buy a TV like this one you are probably not going to use its speakers or remote anyway.  Plans to hook it up to a home theater system seem to be the norm and perhaps the way it should be because to invest in a TV like this is to invest in something you want to use alot and pairing it with high end home theater components would only be natural.

Blacks were dark if not darker than the Panasonic - like looking into a reflective pool of black ink.  The colors were perfect and very lifelike, not oversaturated but not washed out - just spot on.  I watched a few blue-ray's with mixes of darks and colors as well as fast motion and the set just rocked.  No judder at all, just very smooth and an amazing picture.

I must admit, the D8000 is a wonderful TV and has it's own advantages over the HX929, but for my preferences I am glad I returned it for the 55 HX929. I wanted to write this review for anyone trying to decide between the two because it would have saved me a little time with my choice if I went with the Sony first.  First off as I mentioned the D8000 is a great TV and I can see why it is rated as the #2 plasma tv on the market today. The reason I returned the D8000 was because of constant flashes in brightness that is on all models of the D8000 plasma. At first I just thought I was imagining something flash, but couldn't discern what it was. After watching any blueray with black borders it was easy to see it was the brightness that was changing. The entire screen brightness would fluctuate consistently every 20 seconds or so and it began to drive me mad. I started getting a nervous pain in my stomach every time I was watching a movie with friends and they would point out the brightness issue that I had already noticed myself. Some movie scenes also looked a bit too dim at times even after I adjusted the user calibration settings to those listed on the avs forums. I finally had to return the tv after reading that there was no way to fix the fluctuations as of yet on the Samsung. The Panasonic VT30 also has this issue apparently, but there is a firmware update that resolves it. If Samsung had a firmware update I may have stayed with the tv, but then I would have missed out on the Sony.  I've had the Sony for a week now and have loved it immensely. This TV gives you the ability to adjust the picture settings such that the color can be accurate, but still give a little \"pop\" to the screen that I absolutely love. If you sit dead center from this TV the blacks are darker than the D8000 and the whites are whiter. I was nervous going from plasma to the sony led, especially after the best buy guys pushed so hard for the plasma, but now that I've had it and have watched movie after movie and sooo many football games (gotta love that NFL Red zone)I couldn't be happier.  I was nervous that the football games would look awful mimicking a flip book, but it hasn't been the case at all. The sony handles motion very well for a led and almost as good as the D8000. The only reason I can tell the D8000 handles motion a little bit better is because of all the games I watched on the plasma. It's a difference so slight you wouldn't be able to tell unless you immediately switched from plasma to led, but after watching 30 minutes on the led you can't tell a difference any more and the games look great. The picture quality between both sets is almost equivalent (I'd give the slightest of edges to the D8000), but the color, the vividness, the black levels, and the \"wow\" factor both from the overall picture and the physical tv's design (slick, single-pane black screen looks so nice) have to go to the Sony HX929. The only physical tv design I like better than the HX929 is the 55\" D8000 LED design with the near-borderless frame, but Sony's design is definitely my next favorite.  To sum it up exchanging the D8000 plasma for the Sony XBR55HX929 was the best thing I could have done. As much as I liked the Samsung, I looove the 929 even more and would gladly give up the 4\" in screen size over the picture the 929 is capable of producing. For those of you teetering on the edge, this is by far the best led on the market today (aside from the Sharp Elite that is ~2.7k more than the Sony, but the difference between the sets is not worth the 2.7k price difference) and you should pick it up today.  I've done a lot of homework around which TVs to choose and hopefully this review helps some of you with some questions you may have had.

As an early adopter I expected some minor bugs in the firmware and was willing to take the fixes as they arrived.  However, what I did not anticipate was a loud buzzing coming from the backlight in the rear of the set.  The picture that I loved came with an obnoxious buzzing.  It gets noticeably louder as the picture changes from dark to bright.  In fact the buzzing goes away completely during brief black transitions between commercials or scenes.  With the Ambient Light Sensor off (which you want off when you spend time tweaking the picture settings) the buzzing is ridiculous.

It was delivered on time (ordered Labor Day Monday - received Friday - WOW!) from Amazon's shipper in pristine condition.  The delivery personnel put it where I wanted and asked if I wanted it unpacked (which I did not - wasn't ready to hang yet).  As we unpacked it my son easily assembled the base unit though I planned to hang it on a Chief Mfg. articulating wall mount.  We had it hung in no time.  This 55 inch unit is 7 pounds lighter than the 40 inch Sony KDL40XBR3 LCD TV it replaced!  The set-up was a snap and we easily hooked it up wirelessly to our network.  It is hooked up to our HD cable box and a 3D blu-ray player.  Turned on the TV and selected a cable channel and we were dazzled.  The clarity of this TV is phenomenal in the factory setting - it really is like looking through a window.  The problem with that setting though is that there appears to be some motion ghosting/trailing, and the background is jerky in scenes where the camera is following a character as he/she moves.  So we tweaked the settings and now the picture is a little softer and the motion flows smoother.  One other drawback is the smooth glass face which reflects light easily, so this is an issue for us since the set is in a family room with lots of natural lighting - there is no anti-reflective coating like the XBR3.  I also agree with other reviewers that the lack of a hard-copy manual is deplorable for a set of this price.  i-manual built into the TV?  What if your problem (which you are trying to solve using the troubleshooting section of a manual) is that the TV won't turn on or there is power but no picture?  Duh!  Yes - as others have said the sound is minimally adequate, but given the ultra-slim profile it's easy to see why you cannot get good spaekers built into it.  However - at the price Amazon gave me I was also able to order a sound bar system which I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of (from Amazon).  Overall this is a great TV.  Amazon's free shipping, liberal return policy, low price (which went even lower with their price-match policy), and expert handling made this a very satisfying transaction.  Do not hesitate to buy big-ticket items like this from Amazon (remember though - this came directly from Amazon and not a sponsored seller).  Look no further for startling video.

The problems with the TV are too many to list here.December 27thReturn LG and buy Samsung UN46D8000 LED Edge Lit. Samsungs top-of-the-line. Very good TV with one major problem. On about 15 to 20% of the images I notice a 1 inch strip across the top with is very bright white relative to rest of screen. I did hear this TV has screen uniformity issues but I wasn't expecting this. Every time this happens, and it happens a lot, my eyes automatically go to the strip. Noticeable flash lighting too at the edges.January 9Can't get over the white strip at the top. I come to the conclusion that LED edge lit is not a very good technology. Too many bugs. Lots or research before I return Samsung UN46D8000.  I decide plasma might be best. Cnet rates the PN51D8000 a 9,9,9. Can't get much better than that. Most Amazon reviewers like this TV. I buy it. I watch Gladiator that night and think `that is great picture'. Over the next couple of days I notice that images with lots of white turn a sort of grayish dull white and it's bothering me. This is not a setting you can change either. I think Samsung may have done this to get the coveted Energy Star rating. Both wife and I also have a difficult time trying to get this picture to look right especially with flesh tones. Also, I would not consider this to be a very sharp picture. Getting very frustrated with the products these manufactures are getting us to buy. Can't figure out how we, the consumer, have been duped into thinking these are not only good, but excellent. I have had two older LCD wide-screen TV's so I'm not a rookie at adjusting the parameters.Wife is getting upset with me for buying and returning, and yes, returning the plasma too on January 18th.January 18thAfter more research I'm thinking the Sony 820 series would satisfy my quest for a good 2D picture. That's all I really want. A really good 2D picture. I look at the Sony 820 in the store. Quite frankly it just doesn't look very good. Might be the stores feed. At this point I have no idea. Wife asks what's the best TV in this store? Sales person directs us to the Sony XBR46HX929. I look at a very good picture with a pretty high price. Not an edge-lit but a full LED array.

Stanton \"Basil Fawlty\"", "ReviewID": "R18IKFAT3ZV7JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For our 36th anniversary, my wife and I decided that it was time to replace our brobdingdagian (look it up) Hitachi Rear Projection set that we purchased back when real flat screen sets were out of our price range.  Anyway, it seems there are enough choices out there for flat screens that it can make your head swim!  So, I decided to do due diligence and research the possibilities and see if I could at least narrow the possibilities.  After reading reviews, both written and video, of many flat screen TVs, it came down to two possibilities:  Either the Panasonic VIERA TC-P65VT30 (Plasma) or the Sony BRAVIA XBR55HX929 (Back-lit LED).As it happens, both of these sets were on display at a local appliance store so I was able to look at them both pretty much side by side.  They were also very close to the same price (the Sony was on sale for $2699, which, from what I could tell looking at one line prices, was a very good price for this set).  The Panasonic was a little more but it was a 65 inch whereas the Sony was only 55 inch.  My self-imposed price limit was $3000.Picture quality on both sets was outstanding!  In fact it could be argued that the Plasma set was a little better in a dark room.  So, you might be wondering why I went with the 55-inch Sony instead of a larger 65-inch plasma, with maybe a slightly better picture?  Well, first, the difference in picture quality was slight and I knew we would be happy with either.  However, there were a couple of additional factors that led to the Sony.First, the viewing area where our set would be located has a lot of ambient light.  The Sony back-lit LED seems to have a better picture in brighter conditions, whereas the Plasma looked very good in a darker room, but didn't look as good in brighter lighting - it just didn't have the \"pop\" of the back-lit LED Sony.  If I were making a home theater where the lights would be low all the time, I might have leaned more towards the Panasonic Plasma.  But for our lighting situation, I felt the Sony would do better.  Also, the distance from our seating to the set is about 14-15 feet.  Our previous set was a 55-inch rear projection and we found that size about perfect for that viewing distance.  Thus, the fact that the Panasonic was a bigger TV wasn't that much of a factor.  Bigger isn't always better.Finally, I looked at the specs and found that the Sony back-lit LED set consumes less than 1/3rd the power of the Plasma set!  (If you felt the back of the Plasma set in the store, it was very warm, whereas the back of the Sony was much cooler.  I figured this would result in much lower operating costs in the long run.Now that I've had this set for three months, I can honestly say that I could not be happier!  There is a ton of internet content available though this set (NetFlix, Amazon Movies, Hulu Plus, Youtube, Sony Bravia, Crackle, Pandora, and many more).  I am amazed at the picture quality.  For our lighting situation it is perfect!  The picture never get's washed out in a bright room!  (I read that this was the only Sony TV that has \"guerilla glass\" like you see on iPads, which might account for picture quality in bright conditions).  I was a little concerned at some reviews that talk about the picture only looking good if you are viewing straight on.  However, I have not found any significant issues with off-axis viewing.We have some seating that is straight in front of the set, but also some side seating (about 30 degrees off axis).  If there is any difference it isn't enough to bother me.  I find the picture great from any angle.  Even in the store, before I bought the set, I would move side-to-side to try to see the difference everyone was talking about, and while there was \"some\" difference, it wasn't enough to concern me.  I'm very happy with the picture from any angle.The intelligent Peak LED back lighting really makes a difference! The contrast on this set is outstanding in all movie scene lighting conditions!  Also, the \"X-Reality Pro Engine\" is supposed to be some sort of dual chip processor that examines, for example, a streaming video pixel by pixel, and compares each area with a huge database of pixel patterns, and then somehow make corrections to improve image clarity.  I don't fully understand how it works, but it works.  It does seem to help lower-res pictures, for example, streaming SD Netflix videos, or YouTube videos - that look better on this set that even on my Apple 27\" iMac.  In fact, when I watch SD DVDs using my Sony Blu-Ray up-converting player on this set, I'm hard pressed to tell they are not HD BluRay videos.Bottom Line:  I'm glad I did my homework.  This is an outstanding set with an outstanding picture and loads of features!  I have no regrets about buying this set and I'm so glad it was on sale for under my price limit, otherwise I'd have probably gotten the Panasonic.

However, I wanted a show stopper 3DTV has well. Though this TV is 240hz like other sets out there, Sony is using some version of the Bravia engine with a tech they call MotionFlow960 and as far as I can tell, this has taken any form of ghosting and stutter out of the 3D. I'd first seen this TV during CES 2011 and knew that I wanted and finally, a little over a year later, I've got it. The 3D is smooth and doesn't cause headaches. The 3D pops when it needs to and has depth when it needs to (remember that it's up to the film maker to use the 3D as they wish). However, unless passive televisions which only do 720p very eye, Active Shutter based 3D sets deliver a 1080p image to each eye and lets be honest, I didn't buy a 1080p TV and put a blu-ray film in to watch it in 720p.

In the end it came down to the Sony vs a Samsung UN55D8000.  The picture in the two is VERY different.  The Sony colors are slightly duller but much more natural looking.  The Samsung has a super bright very vibrant picture but almost animated looking.  As I researched further I seen that the Samsung was quickly proving to be a very buggy TV.  Main complaint being uneven brightness in the screen possibly due to the ultra thin bezel (designed to give a frameless look) which is not providing enough support.  The one last thing that was the deciding factor was that on this TV you have the option to turn off the Sony logo on the screen.  The Samsung has a VERY bright logo and from all that I could tell cannot be turned off.  That might sound like a small detail but for me it was an option I definitely liked to have.  One of my favorite features is the Corning Gorilla Glass.  Yes I was so happy to see that it was a solid monolithic piece of glass that is much more durable than typical LCD/ LED screens.  You feel safer about cleaning it.Now came down to who to buy from.  The best price I could find anywhere online came from Modia.  They are the ones I ultimately went and bought from.  I tried to get local retailers to price match but none were willing.  First I went to my local Best Buy.  They were priced almost $700 higher than Modia.  I was told they couldn't price match because they had a building and knowledgeable staff to pay for.  If it was $100 higher I would've paid it in order to walk out and take it home then and there.  But $700??  C'mon the building isn't that nice and the staff definitely aren't all that knowledgeable.  I may never buy anything there again.  Then I went to Fry's who agreed to price match but would have to charge a ridiculous amount of tax on top of it.  So home I went to order from Modia through Amazon and wait a week.

I had a 32\" Sony XBR2 tube TV back in the day and there was no other TV that could touch it.  I would still have it today if the movers hadn't dropped it.  I purchased a 55\" XBR rear projection after that and while the picture was really good, I missed my XBR2.  A couple years ago, I bought a 52\" XBR and was blown away again.  Now I have a new favorite.  This 55\" XBR is incredible.  The black levels are fantastic.  The depth of the picture is unreal.  I cannot say enough about this TV.The buying process on Amazon was easy too.  The TV arrived brand new in a box that flew from CA to TX and the carton was not damaged or scuffed.  The carton was so easy to open.  Just pull out the 4 locking plastic tabs at the bottom of the box (2 on each side) and the entire box lifts off the base, leaving the TV in a perfect position to just lift out.Yes, I will agree that the provided base is a bit flimsy.  Most people will not mount this on the base.  It looks so nice on a wall.  If you do use it on a stand, just keep little hands away from it.Another non-issue for most is the sound quality.  It is better than some other super slim TV's but nothing to write home about.  The majority of buyers will have a home theater system or at least a sound bar to provide great quality sound.So until the next Sony XBR comes out, this is my favorite TV.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony XBR TV and delivery from Amazon", "Author": "John Matthews", "ReviewID": "R1MFLHT1BHDZ2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product was easy to order on Amazon and delivery was set up, with an appointment, andthey arrived exactly as scheduled.

However, that was easily fixed with a sound system, which you would expect after spending the bucks on this TV. The other little surprise was that the stand does not rotate on the 65\"...

What tipped me to this decision was a visit to a local store that had every imaginable brand of 65 inch plus TV on display side-by-side with the same video.  I spent several hours there tweaking settings and viewing different videos to be sure that I was seeing a broad range of conditions with the best settings possible for each set.  At the end of that exercise my mind was made up.  Nothing that Samsung, LG, Sharp, Toshiba, Panasonic or others had to offer was even close.  I've had the set for a couple of months now and I'm still extremely happy with my decision.  Every time I sit down in front of it, I think... Wow!

There are some really thorough reviews on here that cover the details of why this TV is so great but I just want to touch on a few things that really impressed me. Before I do that though, I want to make something clear--as I stated on a comment to another review on here, consumers need to know that LED/LCD panels, especially bigger ones, can have defects and that it is just a fairly common problem with this type technology. So please do not blame a particular TV too badly for problems like dead pixels, flashlighting, clouding etc because a percentage of ALL HDTVS of this type have these problems and there are only a handful of panel manufacturers anyway (meaning your TV could really have the same panel made in the same place as 20 others, regardless of brand name). Complaints of the type that target company customer service (or lack thereof) on how the issue is deal with are perfectly valid however.  On my set with a build date in early January, there are no dead pixels, no crease, no screen coming unglued. I did not research too far into the problems to know if they are present initially or develop over time but so far it is good.Now, the wifi works flawlessly with my WPA2-encrypted network, Netflix in HD plays in real time with no problems, and it integrates seamlessly with my other Sony equipment. My BD player and receiver automatically switch on and off with the TV and they operated with the TV remote right out of the box with no searching for programming codes! I was very pleasantly surprised as I figured a new HT setup with all of this stuff would take hours to make work in one remote! Kudos to Bravia-sync! If you have non-Sony equipment BUT STILL USE HDMI, it may support CEC anyway and work similarly with the added time of getting programming codes. These features permeate all of Sony's line, not exclusive to the XBR's.I considered picture quality above all (comparing to others like high-end Panasonic Plasmas, Sharp Quattron, Elite, etc), so I did not really take notice of the TV design. \"Monolithic Design\" I thought? Some catchy phrase that Sony is using to create more hype? But then when I saw it... wow. It looks REALLY nice. The whole face of the TV is black glass. The TV is only about two inches thick. My XBR9 is sadly now \"fat\" and \"ugly\" in comparison... :(. It really looks great in your living room as a solid, sleek, mirror when off. The light-up Sony logo is pretty sharp too, I must say. Really, see it for yourself.The main feature that separates this TV from the competition is the full-array backlight, which, as far as I know, is only found on the Sharp Elite. Go to Best Buy's Magnolia showroom and you'll see the 70\" version of the Elite TV on display with a price tag of about $7K. I don't know about you, but it looked very nice, but not $7K nice and not really noticeably better than the XBR, sorry. Now granted, I did not do a scientific, side-by-side test, but most people won't either and at more than twice the price, it had better show me a large improvement even from across the room. Back to the XBR. To sum it up, the backlit full-array LED means that when a section is dark or black, the LEDs can turn off to create a true black. If your TV does not have this, then when a section is \"black\", it won't really be black but a dark bluish-grey. Look at the TV bezel (if it's black) and compare it to the picture to see the contrast. This TV has the same black levels of my neighbor's similarly-sized plasma and noticeably way better blacks than my XBR9. But it's not just darker truer blacks, it's the overall contrast at all levels in the picture that are great. It really looks much better than the step-down panel of the HX729 and HX829 (same panel as far as I know, the 829 just has the \"Monolithic Design\" whereas the 729 is styled like the lower-end lines). Those and the lower ones are all edge-lit, some of which have local-dimming on a limited 4-zone level only. The XBR has 16 zones that can be independently dimmed. After I saw the difference, not having the full-array backlit screen was a deal breaker for me. It really looks that good.A note though. People say there is a side effect some call \"haloing\" (not to be confused with an over-sharpening artifact in digital video of the same name) or \"blooming\". This is where the area around the zone that is dimmed has a slight but visible transition in lightness to the lit zone. Yes, I see it but under normal viewing, ie actually watching the movie and enjoying it, you will never be bothered. I most notice it when you are watching wide-aspect movies and you see the blooming bleed into the letterboxing (solid black bars above or below the movie). That's where I see it the most, but I see it because I know of the issue. If I didn't know about it, I would probably never notice because even a little glare on the TV is a more noticeable thing. BTW, there is little-to-no glare on the shiny glass screen to my delight (I was a bit concerned about glare on a glossy-screen). So basically, the blooming is not a defect unless you consider things like blue-grey blacks in LCD/LED TVs a defect...it's jus how the tech works so get over it or buy plasma or something exotic like OLED or whatever if it really bothers you. The worse blacks in lower-end TVs are a much worse problem than a little blooming if you ask me.The TV is pretty smart too. It told me I was too close to the TV when I was sitting right in front of it changing cables on the receiver and it turns the display off if no one is watching it.So, even with some of the (legitimately) bad reviews out there, I recommend to try the TV if these features, or any others mentioned in other reviews, interest you. I would recommend though in the event of a defect, to just return it and get a new one rather than trying to deal directly with Sony. Buying from a local store will be a bit easier and this is what I did to have that peace of mind in knowing that a return or exchange will be relatively easy.Note: Unless you have absolutely no idea what you're doing, do not get ripped-off by paying for calibration. I chose CNET's recommended settings for this set, applied to the standard picture setting on the TV (to retain most of the processing and sharpness, which I like) and the TV looks amazing. Also know that all the presets on the TV have different processing applied to them so it is important to start with the standard setting as a basis.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, although cheaper alternatives", "Author": "jrmb", "ReviewID": "R1UUUOR6OAL761", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased four new tv's for my house, two Sony's and two Samsungs, so I can compare these TV's literally side by side.  The TV's I purchased are:1.  Sony Bravia XBR55HX929 LED LCD TV2.  Sony Bravia KDL46NX720 LED LCD TV3.  Samsung PN59D8000 Plasma TV4.  Samsung UN46D7000 LED LCD TVOut of all four, I would recommend the Sony KDL from a performance and price perspective.  The KDL was $1,200 as compared to the XBR at $2,699, and honestly most people won't be able to tell the difference between the two.  Save the money here.  But I love both of them.  I would recommend the Sony HTCT550W Sound Bar though, it makes a great step up in sound if you don't want to go the whole home theater route with speakers all over a room.I am less enthusiastic about the Samsungs.  The Samsung PN59D8000 went in my home theater room, and it does have a great picture and I love watching basketball games on it, but it does emit an audible buzzing noise, and it is really noticeable when you sit directly in front of the TV about ten feet out.  When the Home Theater guys got me set up, they said that was normal for a plasma to emit a low buzzing noise like that, and that it wasn't a defective tv.  I wasn't aware of that when I bought a plasma, so heads up.The worst tv on my list is the Samsung UN46D7000.  I wanted to like this tv, I really did, as it is a great looking tv with the clear bezel and sharp looking silver stand, but the performance is so far below the other tv's on this list it isn't funny.  Quite simply, it can't handle sports and fast motion without going blocky and an extreme amount of blurring.  And, the tv was $300 more than the Sony KDL46NX720.  Save $300 and go with the Sony, you'll be better off.  And yes, I spent one whole evening trying different calibrations from other user reviews to attempt to give my  tv different settings to help with the issue, but no luck.  I would not recommend this tv.Overall, since plasmas apparently emit a low buzzing noise, and the UN46D7000 has some severe performance issues, I would go with the Sonys.

The sticker on the back of my tv states it was built in March 2012.This is an excellent tv, but the big question is whether the high price is justified. I can't answer that question for anyone, but I can point out the advantages of this tv over others.The best things about the tv are:- Very smooth motion. This tv handles quick motion extremely well, action movies and sports look excellent. I'm so impressed by how good basketball looks on this tv. Basketball is a very fast moving game and I'm used to seeing heavy pixelation during fast moving scenes. On this tv the fast moves are very clear.- Perfect black and beautiful colors. Black is truly black on this tv, and every other color is exactly as it should be. The only other LCD tv I've seen such a dark black on is the Sharp Elite, usually LCD tvs have a dark grey instead of actual black. Yes, there is visible blooming when you have a white object on a black background. However, it is not very noticebale in my opinion and I really only see it during end credits.Additional nice points, but not ones that I would pay extra money for:- The overall appearance of the tv is outstanding. This is not something I would usually comment on because I just usually don't care about anything other than the picture quality. However in this case its really worth pointing out that the look of the tv is fantastic. It looks like a great big sheet of black glass from the front. There is no frame around the border. When the tv is on there is about an inch of black glass border around the edges. If you watch a cinema sized movie the borders on top/bottom extend further in, or so it appears. I'm normally annoyed by the black bars that appear on the sides or the top/bottom, but on this tv the black borders merge right in.- Bells and whistles. The tv has a camera built in (though it is practically invisible). The camera is used for a few interesting gimmicks, one of which is actually useful to me. You can set the camera to monitor usage, and essentially shut off the tv if no one is watching for some set amount of time. To my surprise this feature works quite well once you've tweaked it properly, and I like using it. If I walk away from the tv and forget about it, it turns itself off. The camera can also alert you if kids are watching the screen too closely. Again, this works surprisingly well.- Power consumption. According to the sticker, this tv costs approximately $21 in electricity per year if operated for 5 hours per day. This isn't a point I would have made my decision on, but it is a nice little benefit.And now for the things I'm not so happy about:- Very reflective screen. In a bright scene this is not an issue, but in a dark scene you'll see your reflection. The darker your room, the less of an issue this will be. If you are watching a dark movie with sunlight in the room its not going to be a good experience.- The 3D is poor, very poor. One, maybe two stars out of five for this feature. This doesn't seem to be an issue for most people since it seems most people prefer 2D viewing, but I happen to love a good 3D movie. I was truly hoping I'd be able to start watching 3D movies on this tv whenever its an option, but I'm very disappointed with the quality. The first time I tried it out I was appalled - there were terrible double images on everything. After some internet research and learning about crosstalk/ghosting, I was able to work on the display settings until I got to a point where the double image effect was greatly reduced. As much as I try I can't completely eliminate it, but at least I've gotten it to a point where its no longer unbearable. I am very disappointed that this is an issue though - who wants to watch a movie that is frequently blurry? Especially when the 2D version looks perfect. The 3D I see at the movie theatre is far superior. The 3D effect on the tv seems to go into the tv, rather than pop out of the screen as it does in the theatre. And at the theatre I do not see any blurry double imaging.- Off angle viewing. This isn't as bad as I was led to believe from other reviews, but it is still a concern. If you are watching the tv from the side you'll notice two things: colors will appear washed out, and blooming will be very noticeable. It is far from unbearable, you could easily watch an entire movie from the side and quickly forget about the fact that the colors have dulled a bit. If you're inviting a large group of people over to watch something, you'd better call shotgun on the central seating.For the record, I had purchased a Panasonic Viera 65-inch plasma prior to this Sony. I chose to return it as I just did not like the quality of the picture. Amazon has amazing customer service for such a large item. All I had to do was tell them I don't want to keep the tv, and they scheduled a pick up time with me.Overall I am very happy with this tv. The smooth motion and color accuracy make this tv worthwhile to me, particularly since I got 8 years of flawless service out of my last Sony and expect to get at least the same from this one. My big gripe about this tv is that the 3D is awful. I'd say that technically the tv can support 3D viewing, but its so bad that you'll never want to use it.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Five stars = I love it", "Author": "Steven Pemberton", "ReviewID": "R3JLPQS5IUF9VY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was going to give this set four stars due to poor speakers, occasional blooming and not very good side viewing.  However when I hovered over the stars it says that four stars is \"I like it\" and five stars is \"I love it\".  Well I suppose you can guess by now how I feel about this TV. The three issues that I mentioned above I was well aware of before purchasing this set after reading numerous reviews, however I am all about the picture, and when I first turned on this TV after getting it home I knew that I had a made the right decision.  It was not an easy decision.  Five years ago I couldn't believe that I had shelled out 1G for a TV, a 37\" Sony XBR6 LCD, however I really enjoyed that TV and amortized over five years it was definitely worth it.  This year it was time to buy a new slightly larger TV, prices are much lower than they were five years ago and the technology has greatly improved, and I was all set to spend $1,000 again.  Unfortunately for my checkbook I was drawn like a moth to a flame to the XBR HX929 after seeing it on display in a local store, and in basically a zombie-like state I found myself spending 2G on the 46\" model.  I couldn't be happier.  I just finished watching the Blu-ray of West Side Story, I was practically speechless at how good the picture was.  I used the settings recommended on CNET and probably won't change them anytime soon. I haven't installed a sound system yet so I am currently using some decent headphones.  The sound that this TV produces is actually quite good as long as you don't use the built-in speakers.  I made sure to get a full-motion wall mount so that I can point the TV wherever I am sitting to avoid the washout that occurs if you move too far to the side.  As for blooming, I trust Sony that they would have eliminated it if possible but that it is apparently a trade-off that has to be accepted for the technology that they are using to get the unbelievable contrast that this set has.  Sort of like those two thin gray wires that were slightly visible in the otherwise fantastic Sony Trinitron CRT's in the old days.  Since occasional blooming is the only imperfection in this otherwise unbelievable set, I am perfectly fine with it. In my lifetime I have watched movies on B&W; TV, then color TV, then VHS, then Laserdisc, then DVD, then Blu-ray, and now Blu-ray on this fantastic TV.

No problem changing both the vertical (0-6 deg) or the horizontal angles (+_ 20 deg). But, it does shake a bit when this is done. SONY recommends tying the stand down with a bolt/cable (not supplied).

Using the internet is a convenience but unless u are close to the TV you cannot see what the tabs say. The sony camera works great with a good picture however the camera is a usb connection. There is only one usb connection with the TV so you have to get a usb adapter that has several ports because the TV is also 3D. Your 3D glasses need to be charged and there connection is also usb. The remote is a little bulkie but manageable the one problem i have with the remote is where the home button is located.

I will not cut&paste; information from product brochures or C-net reviews. I am a genuine consumer like most of you. I purchased my Sony direct from one of the stores that had the lowest Amazon price a few months ago.I've owned many Sony products over the years and always found them to have a beautiful design and fairly intuitive controls. However, most of my Sony purchases have prematurely failed. I hope this HX929 TV holds up well. I'm glad my friend convinced me to go with the XBR.I am impressed with the picture and it took getting used to the complete lack of flicker experienced with traditional tube televisions or movie theaters (I believe that's the MotionFlow 960 feature). The picture is very life-like with my FIOS-TV service at 1080i. The blacks are very black, but I sometimes wonder if the picture is too black because it lacks contrast in dark movie scenes. I wonder because I have nothing to compare with. The picture is plenty bright and I see no reason to go with a plasma TV.As to the questions on viewing angle, I have no problems whatsoever viewing as much as 30 degrees off-center. Standard-def DVDs look perfectly amazing.Netflix streaming works fairly well, but sometimes stalls during play. This is more likely due to the Internet than anything in the TV, but perhaps the TV needs a larger buffer. Interested in knowing if anyone else experiences those stalls on their PC. Some people complained that Netflix is slow...the TV takes about 30 seconds to negotiate with wi-fi before it can connect with NetFlix. The menus are a little slow and cumbersome, but it works. This isn't a PC!The internal speakers are awful when this TV is used on a stand, but not at all surprising. They might work better when wall mounted (sound reflects). I purchased the HTCT550W sound bar and am very impressed with the sound. Because my house is very old, there is no wall to mount the TV and it doesn't lend itself well to a full home theater system. My only complaint is that the TV rests too low on the stand. When used with the sound bar, the lower part of the bezel is completely blocked, thereby defeating all those features (the presence sensor among others).The menus can be complicated and overwhelming, but the default settings work just fine.I compared the Sony to the Samsung 7000/8000 and other brands, but they just didn't hold up. I originally wanted the Samsung due to my bad Sony experience and it was $1000 more expensive, but that 4-legged stand on the 8000 and the clear bezel on the 7000 are terrible! I also compared against the Sharp Quattron and found their 4-color (RGB+yellow) to be a complete gimmick. The colors on this Sony HX929 are beautiful.I recommend this product for anyone willing to spend almost twice as much as the low-end for a far superior television.Update May 29, 2012:Still very happy with my purchase. Surprised to see the price has gone up $1,000 from Fall 2011. That says a lot about the popularity and quality of this television.Picture quality is superb in all lighting conditions and even off center. I tried playing with the settings a bit, but just didn't want to bother much since the defaults work great. Finally got a Blu-Ray player (Sony BDP-580) and watched The Sound of Music. Blu-Ray DVDs are simply stunning. No flicker. The picture is very life-like!While others have complained about NetFlex, I've had no trouble. The TV takes about a minute to connect with wi-fi after powering on.

I was going back and forth between the Samsung UN55D8000 55\" and this Sony XBR-55HX929 55\" LED TV. The Samsung has really vibrant colors that pop and the 3D is actually quite good. But what made me make my decision is that the Samsung had more problems than the Sony did...problems with the backlighting burning out or acting too bright which causes \"flash lighting\" or clouding on the screen. Sony's problem had to do with \"blooming\" or a \"halo\" effect on the screen...for example: in a dark scene the building lights would cause a \"halo\" effect which makes them brighter than what they should be. I haven't experienced this myself, it could be a manufacturing problem. On the good side...the picture quality on this TV is AMAZING!!! Popping in Avatar on Blu-ray....breathtaking!!!! Almost feels like you're there on Pandora (can't wait for the 3D Blu-ray). I don't like the \"soap opera\" effect so I leave the Cinemotion off, unless its for sports. I calibrated the TV myself using CNET's calibration but tweaked it a little to my preference and it looks really good. 3D is also a feature I like on this TV even though I think 3D is kind of a gimmick and it's still in it's infancy, but I popped in Transformers Dark of The Moon 3D and it looks AMAZING!!! The depth quality is really good. I bought this at the Sony Store and they actually priced match the price I saw on Amazon at Electronic Expo's price and gave me a really good deal I couldn't pass up. For the price of this TV, it's really worth the money you put down if you can't get it cheaper than the retail price. If you're in the market for a new HDTV, the time is now since Sony told me that won't price match anymore after April 1st. I would highly recommend the Sony XBR-55HX929. You won't regret it.

The bells and whistles really shine through no matter what you are watching.  Blue-ray movies look stunning and video games really bring out the excellent black range of this full-array dimming TV.  Sound quality of built in speakers is much better then anticipated, with the \"surround sound\" options enabled it really performs much better then I would have thought.  (you should still have a surround system though!) Built in Wifi and internet is a plus.  Minimization of the frame and full front glass panel really make this a truly beautiful piece of hardware.Cons:Pricey!  Ouch, I got this TV for a slight markdown but it was still a significant investment.  Stand is a little wobbly, this is only noticeable if you are adjusting the viewing angle left to right, but I do have to be careful when moving it.  My only other pet peeve is that there are no included 3D glasses, normal market value for  a pair of two is ~140$, seems like this is Sonys way of getting you to shell out some extra money on an already expensive product.Not sure if this would be a con, but the remote control has an odd shape, that and it also has a power button on the under side. (still trying to determine if i like this feature)Overall:If you are looking for a top of the line 3D TV I highly recommend this product.

Once I did that, which took like 15 minutes, the picture really started to shine.  It didn't look as saturated and vivid as the standard set up. Everything looked warm and natural and the brightness levels looked great.  I suggest that you do some sort of calibration to really open up the capabilities of the TV.

I had what I thought was a great picture in my last Sony DLP KDF-55WF655. This television was a 2004 model and continued to outperform most models today. I had an issue with the optical block going bad and considered repairing it, but parts were hard to find so I looked into a new set. Wow, am I happy with this TV. Never was interested in the 3D aspect of the new models so it was not a selling point for me. Once I saw it at home it just blew me away. I always thought of the movie theater 3D and figured it was the same disappointing hard to see dimly lit picture. I was so wrong. Very bright, liquid, lifelike display. Thats only the begining too, this set has almost everything you could possibly dream of except the glasses needed to view the 3D. That you will have to purchase seperate. There is wi-fi with a host of free content and tons of other sites to join for more viewing options. This set acesses my home network that I store my media on and I can stream it to the television just like my PS3. The picture is so lifelike, I can't say enough about how perfect it is. The only bad I can find about the set is the sound. For a top of the line Sony product this XBR has no sound worth talking about. I purchased the Sony  HTCCT550W soundbar and it made a great difference. The neat thing about everything being a Sony product is that once all linked together through HDMI cabls it performed a SYNC and opereated like a dream, knowing how to sound and display the correct input with identifying when 3D was present or not. Did I mention 1 (one) remote will controll everything too? Well it does and that made life simple.

I turned it on, fiddled my way around to settings and calibrated. Hooked up wifi, registered my tv for amazon prime movies(read note below on the issue with streaming movies below), netflix(read about streaming movie issue below), and off we went. Im no super technological wiz, but this was very easy if you do your online research and read the instructions. Great picture and sound is better than expected without home theater(which I added next since i forgot to order a hdmi cable, so it is even better now). OH...the tv supports arc(audio return channel) for home theater audio/receiver...advantage is one cable as opposed to 5, with supposedly better sound too. Yes, off angle viewing is not good...but its fine for me as I am not going to be sitting 10 feet off to the side. The remote is great. The wifi is great(as there are workarounds for movies streaming problems). I can go online with this tv and you can add these little \"widgets\", like for ebay or web surfing. I am amazed at how easy this stuff is to set up and have running....even all of the accessories. I spent more time putting the wall bracket on the wall than calibrating and registering everything. I have not used 3D which I do not care about. The glasses are also separate and you will have to cough up another 250-300 for them. Also I would deduct half a star for netflix and online streaming as apparently there is an issue with capacity during peak hours....busy nights and weekends were my tv will not even load or stutter and I cannot even watch or stream a movie. My understanding his is due to the fact that the movies are actually run through Sony servers, so it is a Sony issue if this is correct. I just hdmi cabled my laptop and worked the netflix/wifi through my laptop, not so hard, but for what you spend the netflix/wifi portion of your tv should work when you want it to work. SO if you are buying this tv for streaming movies or wifi.....you have been warned! They gave me a number to call at netflix to talk to Sony, but still. Durability is the only issue and time will tell on that. Another nice advantage of this tv is the fact that I will save at least 100 bucks a year on electricity vs any plasma....and probably more vs quite a few. I have had great personal luck with Sony, and the quality I think is pretty high for electronics. If you get a bad one, hopefully it shows itself in the first three months so it can get fixed on Sony's dime.

Trying to utilize the various features can be a challenge at times, but you can access the electronic manual on your ipad and with reasonable effort you can find your way. I can say I strongly recommend this TV, barring anything out of the ordinary, you will not be disappointed with its picture.A note about buying a TV online....I had never done that before and wasn't sure it was something I wanted to do, but at the end of the day, I didn't get any better warm and fuzzys shopping at the big box stores as far as service and such and I happened to find the best price here on Amazon through the 3rd party seller Vanns.

One suggestion;  I have a home theater I have connected to the tv , but if you don't plan on doing this, the on board speakers are very inadequate for proper sound.  Previous Sony XBR's had speakers facing front, which were more than adequate, but this new design seems to have the speakers facing down and back, resulting in considerable loss of low frequency, and a tendency to run the volume at very high levels.

I will not try to duplicate the content of those reviews. I really like the TV, but I feel people should be warned about the difficulty of setting up and keeping external systems connected.I watch a lot of Netflix moves on the TV through the Internet. The TV does an incredible job of displaying those movies. However, about one out of every twenty times I watch a movie, the TV will suddenly stop the movie and display the name of my external audio amp on the screen. I have to go back and start the movie again. Periodically, the TV also loses its Internet content (including Netflix) entirely and the content must be restored through complicated menu commands.The most annoying fault of all is the periodic loss of the HDMI connection with my Marantz home theater system. The only place that I have found a description of how to make the HDMI connection is in the iManual that comes in the TV. The iManual tells you how to do a process called Control for HDMI which you have to do in the TV menus and in the AV receiver. After you follow this complex procedure, the connections works fine and provides great surround sound until a TV firmware update is provided by Sony through the Internet connection. Sony warns you that the update may change some of the TV settings, but they never tell you which settings will change. You find out after the update that your surround sound no longer works. You have to go find your TV and AV receiver manuals and try to figure out, yet again, how to make the two work together. Finally, you remember the iManual and discover the process you have forgotten.

I do have a few mild complaints which I will get to in a few lines.The Resolution - First off, the picture is stunning even with direct sunlight. With my old 1080P TV I couldn't tell the difference between 720P and 1080P resolution but with my new Sony I demand 1080P, the performance is that great. While watching standard definition is fine, I struggle to find new HD content that is truly 1080P. Keep in mind, most TV providers still only offer 1080I, which is much less than 1080P. My blu-ray player and streaming content from Netflix via the tv app are the only sources I have that can transmit full 1080P. I just ordered the newly released Apple-TV which also works in 1080P (excited).The Audio - While I have a surround sound system the built in speakers do a great job for regular TV viewing. They are well hidden out of sight behind the unit and (I assume) are designed to reflect the sound of the wall it is mounted on.The Construction - The monolithic design makes it look like a piece of artwork when it's not being used. While I can see the outline of where the screen starts it takes a focused glance to do so. One of my complaints is about the construction, please see below.The Complaints - First off, these are mild complaints and I could have easily returned the unit if I wanted too.The first complain, which I have read other people are having problems with is a very faint ripple in the black frame. In direct sunlight when I look at it from a steep angle I can see a wave-like pattern in the lower frame. When I run my finger over it I can't feel it so it's definitely something behind the layer of glass. I can only see this when I specifically look for it, not a big deal but would think with it's price that it should have been caught on final inspection. This is my reason for not giving a full five starts.The second complain - SHIPPING. The direct ship company HOME DIRECT USA is absolutely horrible. While I will give a brief synopsis of what happen, feel free to read the 200+ complaints here on Amazon - just Google \"home direct usa\" It should be the second item in your results labeled \"Amazon.com: Customer Discussions: Home Direct USA Sucks!!!!!!\" When I ordered my TV I received zero tracking information, and it arrived over three weeks late. When it arrived the top had been slashed open and the top contents (remote & tv stand) were gone. Also, if I wasn't observant they would have delivered someone else's TV instead of mine. Horrible company, calling them is a huge waste of time as no one knows where anything is. . .All and all this is such a great tv that I wait for most movies to come out on Blu-ray instead of going to the theater.

I got a great price on this set and took advantage of 24 months of 0% interest payments with my Amazon Store Card.  Sweet.I ordered this TV directly from Amazon and it arrived 2 days later.  Came via Pilot.  The Amazon reps and everyone I talked to at Pilot were very cordial and knew what they were talking about.  I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and recommend them to everyone for just about anything.  This TV is the most expensive item I've bought here and I'm glad I did.  It worked great right out of the box.  Connected to my home wireless network with out a hitch.  And the picture is top notch.  I am very picky about all things A/V and so far no complaints here.  I replaced an 8 year old Sony 50\" rear projection TV (still great picture, going into a bed room now) and it is stunning.  I've only had this TV a couple of days.  As I get to know it better I will update this review.  So far very, very pleased with it.  By the way it comes with 18 months of Sony warranty coverage not just a year or less like many other brands.Update:  For me the \"Cinema 1\" setting is the best looking picture.  Energy Saver = Off.  Off angle viewing is a lot better than reported in many reviews of the TV.  It was almost a deal breaker for me but I'm glad those reports didn't stop me from buying this set.  Even the off-angle picture is better than a lot of sets straight on.  ARC feature works perfectly so only one HDMI cable is needed to connect to my Yamaha RX-A810.  So far really nice experience with this set up.Update 2/24/2012:  I still like the \"Cinema 1\" setting the best for all viewing.  From hockey to basketball the picture is amazing.  I just watched the last 2 days of match play on the Golf Channel and the picture was just about perfect. Black levels are among the best I've seen and all in all I could not be happier with this set.

Colors are bright, vibrant, and clear. Contrast is phenomenal, black levels approach those of the best Plasma's.You still have some issues inherent to the technology rather than a fault of the unit (some motion blur regardless of refresh rate claims, some limited off angle degradation of 3D images, etc). These issues are easy to overlook when you consider the clarity of the image and the brightness of the colors. With certain HD and Blu Ray signals the picture looks virtually perfect.....no pixelation or grey scaling issues and huge color contrast. The picture is simply wicked.Plasma's have their own issues. Do your research...go look at the models in the store and make a decision based on picture quality. To me, plasmas tend to look darker and lack the \"punch\" that the most vibrant LED/LCD's offer. Also, they hog energy, can be loud and buzzy, and are complicated technology wise (more can go wrong). However, some look wonderful. Just see what works best for you.Now, about the 3D. LED/LCD has taken a rap for displaying a darker 3D image than a \"regular\" HD signal. Not with this XBR. 3D remains crystal clear and bright. You have to bang your head around to goof the colors, though off angle viewing isn't great. Just sit in front of the TV and you won't have anything to complain about. 3D is frankly nifty.I have the rechargeable glasses... some people have complained these were too tight.

I've also had a few weeks to use the TV. I want this review to be helpful, so I've edited it significantly. It is still meant to complement already existing reviews to elaborate on some finer details not mentioned anywhere else. I'll keep updating it as I see necessary.WHYI bought this after many months of comparison to the Samsung D8000, my primary reason being that my last two TVs were Sony and I was quite pleased with their quality and how long they lasted. I use this TV to play HD and 3D video games on PS3 and Xbox 360, as well as watch Blu-ray and streaming HD media.BUYING EXPERIENCE / INITIAL IMPRESSIONSThe first HX929 I got from Amazon had a dead pixel. Amazon did a full and painless replacement. Amazon's expected 2-day delivery was way-off, and it took about 5 since the courier then has their own delivery window.This is important: the second HX929 was very different, it was significantly brighter and sharper. I didn't realize it, but after messing with the settings on the new TV for a while I was sure the first one was a total defect. I had no idea!Many complain about the \"crease,\" I will say that if it's there it's hardly note-worthy, or maybe I just have a newer set and it has been fixed. I originally complained about white splotches, exhibited by both sets I tried in the same parts of the screen, but a recent firmware update seems to have solved the issue and I haven't seen them since! This was a major gripe and initially caused me to rate the TV 4-stars.FULL-ARRAY LEDWhen you're watching a movie or playing a game the contrast is amazing, black-and-white never looked so good! There's nothing more to say, you have to see and judge it yourself.However, there's a catch. Since it lights up AREAS of the screen, in a computerized interface like a video game or DVD menu where there is a lot of white on black, the white stuff appears to have holy glows around it, so it's not the amazing contrasting effect of deep black juxtaposing bright white that maybe you'd hope for in those situations. If you need absolute precision you can always turn it off.HUMAN INTERFACEThe menus and user interface of the TV are ugly and very clunky, even compared to menus on older Sony TVs. The background for most of it is a black-purple gradient, and movie covers (et. al.) get scaled poorly and look grainy. The thumbnails load dynamically with no caching, so paging up and down results in waiting for images to load; if you page up or down too fast on a long list (such as a Netflix Queue) the TV sometimes throws an error and fails to load the data.Setup was uniquely painless for a Sony product. I even installed 2 software updates and they both took less than a minute, a fraction of the time of a notoriously long PS3 update.It's also real snappy. Turning it on, switching inputs, it's not instant, but it's pleasantly fast compared to other TVs. When powering up, it tends to take a little while to connect to the network and allow you to use things like the Netflix button, and if you pressure it, it can glitch out and not load the menu items at all until you reboot it or click the Bravia Internet Video button to \"update\" it.Text entry happens a lot with this TV. Text is entered using UT9 entry - a telephone pad comes up on the screen complete with diacritics; a bit cumbersome when you consider the samsung remote has a keyboard. It's even worse that you can NOT hook a keyboard up to it. The best case scenario is if you have an iPhone or iPod, you can use the Sony Remote App to type with your phone's keypad. Not ideal, not great, but slightly better than nothing at all.The remote is as bare-bones as possible. It sort of works with my H/K receiver, but not my media center or my Xbox. The Netflix button is excellent, and there's a light function but it's nothing special. You can also download the remote control app from Sony for your iPhone. It's a little weird, but it works; sadly in this app the Netflix button is missing, and the buttons are spread out across \"pages\" meaning you have to scroll before you can adjust the volume. It also does not have the \"universal\" functionality of the actual remote, so it's pretty useless if you have an audio system. I suggest a Logitech Harmony remote.NON-ADVERTISED FEATURES- Response time: You can tweak settings and turn-off features to improve response-time for gaming.- Overscan: I am able to get pixel-perfect images from both the Xbox and the PS3 over HDMI with viewable overscan (I had to use the PC inteface for pixel matching on my old Bravia LCD). This is a must-have for any serious gamer.- Input Labels: You can text-edit names of inputs and disable unused ones automatically, and select from preset icons (only one game icon, a PS3 controller). Very helpful for multi-console gamers or families with gamers.- PIP: Named \"Twin Picture,\" it only works between a video input and the tuner as far as I can tell. It can do either inset in a corner or side-by-side, with one screen being roughly 30% larger than the other. Sadly the network video features don't work with PIP. This is perfect for gamers who need to share the TV with others.- This set handles side-by-side or top-bottom 3D, among others, so Gears of War 3 works plenty fine in 3D.- You can use the iPhone or iPod as your remote via Wi-Fi, as well as play media from it. (See human interface section).CRITICISMS- Sony's own Motorstorm Pacific Rift 3D for PS3, ironically, does not work in 3D on this set even though it worked fine on the Samsung D8000, and even though the PS3 auto-detects the 3D capabilities. I do not know why and will update if I ever figure it out.- The \"Widget\" system, made by Yahoo, is awful and pretty much useless. I tried for 15 minutes to change the weather widget to my city and it bugged out on me over and over, duplicating widgets, deleting widgets, and never giving me my weather. I gave up. I might try again now with the updates, but I don't really get the point of having the widgets.- I can't get it to work with my non-Windows-based media center over Wi-Fi, even though the media center works with the Xbox. Not a huge deal but worth noting.- Audio is delayed when passing-through. With the PS3 and the Xbox you'll want to run optical cables straight to the receiver or you'll get a significant delay (~800 MS?).- The stand is sort of wobbly, I mounted it my stand.- The mounting points: what were they thinking?! They're not in-line! They're slightly askew, I had to use special mounting hardware to get it mounted to my stand. Now that it's up it's fine, but it may cause some people mounting headaches.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "sony Bravia XBR46HX929 purchased at amazon.com", "Author": "Billy E.

This wasnt my first choice due to the steep price tag of the 929. I bought an LG6500 led but it was defective from the start and was returned. I didnt want another LG after that experience or a Samsung due to reliability and poor customer service. I was really wanting the sony and considered a Panasonic plasma. I shyed away from the plasma do to all the precautions that have to be taken to avoid burn in and other issues. My plasmas were well cared for but I was dissappointed at the short life before the problems start. I have heard alot of positive reviews about the Panasonic plasmas however. The Sony was bought on sale and that is the reason I decided to purchase it. Out of the box the first thing you will notice is how thin and light the set is. My plasma was thick and very heavy. It took some strength to lift it. The Sony in comparison is a breeze to place. Set up took a little time and I felt the menu options were tricky to find. The internet connection was was tricky to set up and didnt want to connect. In comparison the LG was quick and simple, providing a solid connection. I liked the LG s magic wand feature to, so quick and easy. Kudos to LG. Next was the picture set up. Like all new tvs, the set was set at near max levels of brightness and colors. The blooming people talk about was very apparent when there were dark scenes with light areas. Even after trying others recommended settings, blooming was still apparent and color was dull. I started making changes myself by trial /error and alot of time. The TV is now the way I like it and beats my plasma in many areas. The blooming is only minimally apparent when credits are rolling over the black screen at the end of movies. I never see anything unnatural when viewing and Im picky, hence the reason for going plasma initially. The blacks are awesome, very inky as CNET proclaimed in their review. This is accomplished through the backlit local dimming. The Sony can turn zones of the leds completely off similar to a plasma. The blacks are as deep if not deeper than my plasma was. Next is the color, very vibrant and rich. There is \"pop\" normally associated with plasmas evident to. The color is better than my plasma was with bright, richness that makes being there the only next best thing. The gorilla glass allows the color through with minimal glare. Skin tones have always been an issue with LCD displays, but not the Sony XBR. Faces look natural as they should, no washed out bleachy appearance here. This is where I started noticing the XBR picture engine shine. I have never experienced such a sharp, detailed picture. Other tvs including plasma seem sharp, until they are next to the Sony. You will see every hair on the head, pores in the skin ect in sharp but natural detail. Very impressive feature that other manufactures are falling short on and may not realize it. As far as response time, no blurring issues were noticed while viewing high speed sports. The 3D feature is cool to. You have to purchase powered 3D glasses separately which is a no go for such an expensive tv. LG includes 4 pairs of glasses with their sets. The Sony has active 3D requiring the battery powered glasses that flicker to produce the 3D effect. Turn the settings on low for tv and low for the glasses for a headache free experience. The LG 3D is like the movie theater passive 3D. The passive is easier to set up and much cheaper glasses. I personally like the passive 3D of the LG over active 3D. The glasses are cheaper, lighter and dont flicker. Overall the Sony produces a 5 star picture if you take the time to understand the settings and tweak it. Moving on to the sound. Not nearly as impressive as the picture. The speakers are small, rear facing and it was difficult to get the voice loud enough to not get overpowered by other sounds. This was a big headache but is achievable with lots of small changes. In comparison, the Samsung and LG were much easier to adjust the frequencies. Both had bigger speakers with the Samsung having a \"spoiler\" that projected the sound forward towards the viewer. I am happy with the sound on the Sony and if you ever want more, either a sound bar of home entertainment will cure all concerns. 90% of the time I use the tv s speakers and only use the home entertainment for movies. Seems that the sound gets better over time, hmmm. That pretty much completes the viewing experience for the Sony, it has 4 hdmi ports a USB and RCA hookup via component in adapter and PC connector.The price is steep and not affordable for all, though you will save a noticeable amount of cash on your monthly electric bill when compared to most plasmas. Hope Sony will be able to lower the price from the Amazon 3k in the near future. Reliability; everyone I have talked to that have owned Sony s for years, rave about the reliability. There is nothing like laying down your hard earned cash for a new tv and wondering what its going to cost you down the road.

FYI, when I bought this TV from AMZN two months ago a representative was assigned to my purchase to make sure everything went smoothly and thank God it did.

I viewed movies from a Oppo 93 BluRay player as well as a WDTV Live media player.  Each gave excellent viewing.  In some cases, it appeared as though I was looking thru glass.  Viewing broadcast HDTV channels was excellent.  I had calibrated the TV as per CNET's calibration from their review of this TV and am currently happy with that calibration which CNET considers a good General scene mode setting.  I haven't tried yet the Cinema Scene mode but understand from CNET that that Scene mode is a good scene mode.I do prefer the Sport Scene mode on the TV especially Football.  But for some reason the Cable News Network Channels such as Fox News Channel just don't look as good to me as they did on my Visio HDTV.  And then occasionally these news channels look better.  I don't know what's going on with that but I only have had the TV now for a few days.  I haven't had a chance to try the 3D yet buy I did buy a few pairs of Sony's Titanium 3D glasses to go with the set.I thought it might be important to note something here that I haven't seen in any of the other previous reviews. I had been looking for a keyboard solution and had come to the conclusion that I would have to purchase one of the Sony Vaio E-Series notebooks (or netbooks)in order to get the Remote Keyboard proprietary software.  But before purchasing, I thought I would try one other option.  So I downloaded something called Media Remote (a Sony Application) from the android market for my Galaxy S3 Android phone.  According to the specs, this Bravia TV was not supported.  But I installed it anyways and I was surprised that it did, in fact, register the Bravia and I can now control the TV with the Android Phone as well as use the keyboard in the Media Remote software from the Android phone.  At first, after installing the software on the phone, it could not find the Bravia TV.  But a message popped up on the Bravia that the firmware of the TV needed to be updated.  I don't know if this was a response of the Media Remote software unable to find the Bravia during its search to register the Bravia.  I suspect it was.  But the fact is that immediately after the Bravia updated its firmware, the Media Remote software on the Android phone was then able to register the Bravia TV with no problem.Anyways, as long as the Media Remote software on my Android continues to work, I may have saved myself several hundred dollars that I was about to spend on a Sony Vaio Series E notebook.  I hope this helps others who may be looking for a keyboard solution for their Bravia XBR-55HX929 TV.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony XBR46HX929", "Author": "AZ Baseball", "ReviewID": "R3MD8Y9GVRAO5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a very bright family room and although I have tried rear projection DLP, plasma amd LED in here, the only thing that ever worked in the past (at least for daylight viewing) was a good old fashioned tube TV.

We highly recommend it! We've had this TV for 4 months. We took our time looking and comparing, and reading a lot of information about 3D TVs, and right out of the box this Sony XBR55HX929 proved our choice to be the right one. The intense detail and color in the pictures for TV, movie, and 3D viewing is phenomenal and beyond anything we could have imagined. The 3D glasses (two types: battery and rechargeable) have both comfortably fit all ages quite well (so far, ages 8 through adult); including over prescription eyeglasses. Buy high speed cables for best results. It has a no-glare screen. The TV speakers are just fine and we have not found them to be any less powerful than our prior analog TV - we often run TV shows without powering up additional speakers. Side angle viewing is never going to be the same as sitting in front of the TV, but the little bit of fading that can be noticed is not significant by any means. Syncs extremely well with the PS3 but in order to charge the PS3 DualShock controllers, the TV has to be on (for us, this is not a consumer friendly feature and is a significant flaw because sometimes you just want to charge a controller but not have the TV on. Yes, they sell a separate dock for recharging these controllers but it's just another piece of equipment lying around collecting dust). The only two cons are: 1) the lack of it having a screen saver (a wonderful feature that is surprisingly missing); 2) Closed Caption does not come on when \"mute\" is pushed (a great feature on our prior TV, especially when a word or sentence spoken by an actor is muffled, it was easy to go back and mute and see the words). With the Sony TV, the CC has to be specifically turned on and off through a menu. Unfortunately, such features or lack of them can only be discovered after buying a product; however, none of the cons would prevent us from buying this TV again! We are totally enjoying our experience with this amazing TV!For those who suffer from vertigo, the following is my personal experience with 3D viewing. As a person with severe vertigo, I scoured the Internet looking for information on how 3D TV and playing 3D games on PlayStation 3 would affect those with vertigo but found no significant information about this issue. We first looked into purchasing a passive 3D TV as a solution but quickly discovered the 3D picture quality was poor. We then proceeded with our purchase of the Sony XBR55HX929 active 3D TV, but I was completely unsure if I would be able to watch 3D on it without causing a vertigo episode. We have had this TV now for four months and we have watched at least ten 3D movies, some with significant action and some with scenes designed to resemble an intense rollercoaster ride with lots of twisting and turning, as in the newer version of the movie \"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\" I quickly discovered that I could watch 3D TV without having a vertigo attack. When viewing 3D in a movie theater that involves a lot of motion or intense rollercoaster-like scenes, those with vertigo know to center their vision on single spot on the screen and wait it out (or keep eyes closed). Trying to watch the entire movie screen during such intense twisting and turning action would set off a vertigo episode. Using this same method has been helpful too when watching 3D TV with intense rollercoaster-like action scenes. However, surprisingly, watching action scenes with a lot of movement but with less intense twisting and turning on the 3D TV have not provoked the vertigo. My experience with trying to play a 3D game on PlayStation 3 that has a lot of twisting and turning in the action scenes (\"Cars 2\" in 3D), did immediately set off the vertigo and I learned I cannot play those types of 3D games.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "SonyXBR", "Author": "Billjax", "ReviewID": "R2MCKD3ZVLYBI7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Outstanding TV.

When our 11 year-old 32\" Sony Wega TV broke down I decided to get a new LCD TV.  I did extensive research and decided on a Sony KDL42EX440.  However, when I received it and hooked it up, I was very disappointed in the black levels.  I watch movies in a pitch-black room to get as close to a movie theater experience as possible, but the blacks looked more like dark gray on this TV even when I turned down the brightness and backlight.  Next, I tried a Sony KDL-46HX750 and the blacks were only slightly better (but still more like dark gray) so back to Amazon it went. Next I tried a Sony46HX850.  I was really excited at first because the black levels were much better and when the screen was full-black it literally matched the bezel....but when there was any light anywhere on the screen (a credit roll for instance) the black didn't match the bezel and it was more like a dark gray. Also, at the bottom corners, light would leak onto the screen in dark scenes (flashlighting). I tried another unit and it was the same way.  So, back goes the HX850! Well, at this point I'm getting very discouraged, since the only model above the HX850 is the XBR46HX929, a full-array LED TV with local dimming and the price is way over my budget!Then, \"Lo and Behold\", I see a listing from Amazon Warehouse deals for the Sony XBRHX929 at an incredibly low price due to a \"cosmetic imperfection\". So I ordered it immediately!Let me tell you that, when I unpacked this TV and hooked it up, I was blown away by the beauty of the thing! The screen looks like a solid black piece of glass when the unit is off and it is gorgeous. You almost need a magnifying glass to see the \"cosmetic imperfection!\"  When I hooked up my Blu-ray and computer and turned it on, I was totally amazed by the picture quality!  The blacks are so deep and inky, they totally match the bezel and give wonderful contrast causing the picture to pop out at you in almost every scene!  The only thing I noticed was a type of blooming, causing black next to a very bright area to be a little lighter....but this isn't very often and is only barely noticable.A perfect example of the great black level is the credit roll at the end of the Tim Burton \"Dark Shadows\" Blu-ray.  The credits are bright white against pitch-black, which perfectly matches the bezel.  Between scenes in a darkened room, the whole room goes black and you can't even see the TV (except for the totally-cool, defeatable backlit \"Sony\" logo, which I choose to leave on).You can completely eliminate \"Judder\" during camera pans using the \"Motionflow\" settings, but I leave it off in order to make the experience more filmic.  I've only had this TV for a week or so, so when I have time I'll try to find a setting that eliminates the judder without causing the \"Soap Opera Effect\".The \"Gorilla Glass\" is wonderful and extremely resistant  to scratches.This is the most beautiful TV I have ever seen and the picture is as close to perfect as I could ever hope for!I RECOMMEND THIS TV TO A PERFECTIONIST WHO WILL ONLY ACCEPT THE VERY BEST THAT CONSUMER ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY HAS TO OFFER.You simply can't go wrong with the Sony XBR46HX929!", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV at another level", "Author": "Hopeless", "ReviewID": "RLEO9KK265KC8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The tv is everything I wanted and more with the picture quality is amazing to watch and every movie is awesome in clarity, best one yet from Sony and I have enjoyed all Sony tv's I have had my whole life.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy setup, fantastic picture, and nice web apps", "Author": "Marc Dulude", "ReviewID": "RPO1NS9KGKYZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I set up the TV in a matter of minutes and it worked great.

Those were all the similar. However, this 2012 build date one is MUCH different. Apparently they started using the hx850 panels on this hx929! At least for 46 inches.How do I know this? The viewing angles are MUCH MUCH MUCH better now. Also I have tried an hx850 before and so I know based on memory, very well, how the 929 and 850 act. This is NOT the same as the 2011 929 panels. It can't be. It's too different.Also the CNET settings were very close on the 2011 ones, but using them now it seems to have no shadow detail. The colors don't look as accurate on this one, just as they don't on the hx850. Personally i think color accuracy matters a ton, although so does viewing angles.I haven't checked for blooming yet. It has zero flashlighting, though. So it seems to me this 2012 build is absically a hybrid of the hx929 and hx850. It's an hx850 with full array and then the feature set of the 929 and the stand (unfortunately) of the 929.Nobody ever seems to mention SOny as a panel lottery type, but trust me, they do use different panels in their tvs. Most of you simply haven't tried multiples of the same model as I have.  I tried multiple nx720s which looked different. The ex500 I have seen THREE having totallty different PQ looks.Apparently at some point Sony starts using newer panels on old models not quite discontinued yet.ALL current gen tvs give me major head problems. But the picture looks so good, I am tempted to keep this one and try to make it work, even if I can only use it occasionally and must still use my old tv as well. Then if I flat out find it not worth the head issues, I bet i could get every penny back for it by selling it through Amaszon or elsewhere used because I'm sure there aren't many hx929s out there with these better viewing angles and plus Sony is done making xbrs for 46 inches and soon someone would have to buy used or never get another SOny full array 46. So it may be a good investment even if I don't get these head issues to stop. :)This is being written in September, by the way.

Hoping this will be remedied fast but my past experiences are scaring me. Here's a bit of interesting information I hope you consider before purchasing.Prior to the Sony XBR55HX929 I purchased a new LG 55LX9500 from OneCall at end of February 2011 for $2198.00.  The tv design was great except it had terrible banding lines that ran across the screen horizontally every 2\" from the top of the TV to the bottom.  Some scenes showed it vertically the same, so the screen would look like a checker box of halo lines.At first I was willing to except it because I got the tv at a good price.  Then I realized the lines were always what my eyes were going to first and they seemed to be getting more and more relevant.  Long story short, I went through months and months of shameful customer service from LG (will never buy another LG product) including lie after lie, deception after deception (i.e. LG service technician Daniel Arias documented he came out and visited my home for service including a full report when on the day of service appointment he did not show up but later called and said the panel needs to be replaced...then the panel was on back order for months and months.. then he claimed to confirm the panel was shipped via FedEx and should be there any minute...then a rep from LG Resolutions called and said the panel was cancelled and LG would prefer to buyback (bc I got it on sale and the panel costs the same)..LG finally offered buyback of purchase price... Couple of thug looking service men from NVC Logistics show up to take the tv without packaging, safe wrapping or boxing it and throw it back of their truck with a blanket.. Now still waiting for my refund check from LG.I decided to try buying a new Sony XBR55HX929 again from OneCall for $2419 because they had the best price, reviews and what I thought was a good return policy.  The TV shows up with what looks like little blisters in the black glass along the top and sides.  One spot is in the lower main viewing area and looks like a dead pixel (black dot) but with the tv off you see it is a little blister on the screen.  The best way to describe it is it looks like what happens to cheap window tint.  It pops, scratches out in the dark, etc. On the 3rd day after it arrived I called OneCall and spoke with Paige who told me if I wanted to pay return shipping she would take it back.  I said no the tv arrived defective and I would like a replacement or a refund.  She responding by telling me she would listen in on a service call I can make to Sony (3 way call from her end).So I/we called Sony and I spoke with Manuel Sony Employee ID# C15P who basically sounded like he could care less and documented the problems and started to tell me I would need to contact the dealer when Paige from OneCall spoke up and said she was listening to the call and asked if Sony could send someone out to my home for service.  Of course now Manuel's tone of voice changed and there was something in fact he could do... (ha, interesting character cue).  I let them both know sending out a technician was useless unless they were coming with a new screen or tv as the screen is defective and there are no functional problems I need help with.  The Sony rep said it was procedure and that \"someone should call me within 5 business days but if they don't I should call them back.\"Paige from OneCall told me at the end  after hanging up with Sony that if they don't call me in 5 days she will contact them on my behalf.  In my opinion this is not good service from both Sony and OneCall.  OneCall should immediately replace the brand new TV which is the second one I've purchased (now $5000 spent with them) and has arrived defective from their establishment.I will update this in 5 days or asap to report OneCall and Sony's next move.  Be very aware of what you may deal with when buying what are marketed as flagship models online from Sony, LG and OneCall (two experiences with nice service gals from OneCall but little actual help or resolution. Would not offer/or accept request to take back the defective 55LX9500, 4 pairs of LG 3D Glasses for credit or refund, the defective Sony XBR 3days after arrival, but did offer to sell Sony bundle 3D glasses at discount of $90 when amazon sells normally for $114...???).***UPDATE***After waiting 30+ days from when the television left my home and having placed several additional phone calls with LG I did receive my refund check for the tv.  They did not refund the 4 pairs of glasses so I am out $400 for those since I will not ever purchase LG again. What a hassle and a half but at least it is over.As for the Sony, after I placed this review sony requested i send  them photographs of the issue.  I did.  Then a technician from third party vendor adams electronics contacted me to schedule an inspection. He confirmed the tv was defective due to the misfiring pixel but mentioned the blisters generally are not covered.  I  told him i would never accept a tv with visual or functiional defects and he agreed he wouldnt either.  He also confirmed the issue would worsen.  Then finally i was offered the choice of a refund or a replacement by OneCall as well as a choice to get a replacement from Sony plus $150 stipend from one call if i select the latter. I  applaud this offer as both companies just kept a customer but it should have been the first offer in my opinion.I chose to get the replacement from Sony and the payment from one call... Both occurred successfully.The new Sony arrived without any major visual defects on the screen and the picture quality is in fact outstanding.  It does still have some minor banding lines in certain scenes which I didn't notice in the first Sony I received but it is no where near as bad as the LG.  i think this may be an issue with the techonolgy vs. the tv to some degree but it is atleast not distracting in every scene anbymore. The 3d is also much much better than the LG.  The LG had no controls offered for the picture when in 3d where as the sony gives almost all picture controls.  In fact everything about the Sony is better for the most part.  Certain scenes in the LG did look more realistic but it was not ever consistent thus making it really noticeable when it fluctuated.  The Sony delivers a pretty high quality picture rather consistently, making the overall impression of the set good.  The blacks on the Sony are also superior to the LG as are all the offered web applications.  It would be nice to see Vudu though on the Sony.  My only other complaint is in 3d the Sony is really sensitive to tilting your head.  Far more than the LG was.  also you can't swivel the Sony on its stand as much as you could the lg.  the lg offered impressive ability to rotate the set.Overall i am very pleased with the change from LG to Sony.  I wish it wouldn't have been as difficult for a customer who receives a defective product to remedy the issue but in the end the sony is now for sale for $3498 since the new sony line is out and so I'm pleased I got it when I did.  My search would have had me next spending $4500 on the sharp elite if I had to, but I'm really glad i didn't.  It would have been 17% better of a tv for 100% more of the price.(Hello Hawaii instead)Shop Smart.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV, top of the line with some minor concerns..", "Author": "George Irakis", "ReviewID": "R7T50EZHWBUR1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great TV.  Very sophisticated and clearly the best picture out there amongst LED's.  Rich/vibrant color and true deep blacks.

Don't even bother doing a search, you'll be wasting your time waiting for it to load a result which will ultimately be unsuccessful.  Huge disappointment here !  Another major disaster is the remote control Sony provides you with.  Are you kidding me ?  A $3K plus \"SmartTV\" and you don't get a wireless Qwerty Keyboard to navigate with??????  Sony insults the consumer with this idiot remote that basically transports you back 10yrs ago when we were typing on our flip/clam shell cell phones.  Its painful trying to enter titles and search via this remote.  Lastly, at this price I would have expected some entry level 3D glasses to come standard.  I'm not asking for $100 or even $60 glasses.  Just something to at least reward the consumer and serve as an appetizer in case you truly crave the 3D experience.  Personally, I don't find myself watching anything in 3D.  Nonetheless, it would have enticed me to buy the Titanium 3D Active glasses if I had been tweaked properly.

To pair with a Sony PS3 I'm a big PC gamer. But I'm really into the Playstation Move games. I've been wanting to try Sony 3D Movies and PS3 3D Games I already had. Well, my better half has been dropping hints to me ever since.  That I'm going to come home and find he stole it for his Man Cave.  We've sat together in my Woman Cave and watched Tron 3D and a few other movies, plus some move games.I can take a hint!  We have a Sony HD 50\" (5 years old) in the living room and it starting to show it's age.  When I saw the sell for this XBR55HX929 I jumped on it.  Was a Fantasic price from Amazon! Needless to say Better Half now has a 3D TV to watch all to himself (if he wants it that way) in our living room.  He's happy as a clam in sauce and HX929 is really a great TV.Pros: has built in 3D sensorCon: location of 3D sensorHaving problem when I tried to play 3D Move games w/Sharpshooter. To explain this my 55HX929 is setting on our prior HD 50\" TV's Stand (not wall mounted).  Playing with the Sony Sharpshooter attachment on games like 007 GoldenEye that's 3D.  I would loose the 3D effect often.  I put the PlayStation Eye on top and the 55\" 3D senor is bottom right side of the TV frame.  Ok well I'm right handed I tend to hold the Sharpshooter up to my cheek for better aiming.  I have on the 3D glasses and I noted the 3D would drop in and out. That sharpshooter would block the 3D Glasses from time to time being seen by the 55HX929 3D sensor at bottom right side.My 40HX800 had no built in 3D sensor. I got that 40\" with Alice 3D Kit. So I have the external 3D Sensor on Top Center of TV then the PlayStation Eye camera is Bottom Center.  That combo I've never had the 3D drop in or out holding the Sharpshooter up to my cheek for optimal aiming.Con: I'm more use to the menu on the 40HX800 which I find is much easier to navigate. I'm getting often lost with 55HX929 menu system. (just need more time to learn it)Pro: Remote is nicer for the 55HX929 than the 40HX800.Con: 55HX929 has an illumination all buttons for the remote. However it doesn't stay lighted for long. Like just a few seconds. I can't seem to find the button I want in the dark before the lighted buttons goes off on me.  (should have a longer lit time)Con: Base Mount is super scary the TV seems to vary wobbly to me.  I don't think I'll break out Dance Central till we do a wall mount!Con: No 3D glasses included or extra anything thrown in.  On my 40HX800 purchase I got 2 free 3D movies ship to my home from Sony when I registered my TV on Sony Style.Pro: I like the next gen USB Rechargable 3D Glasses Model TDG-BR250 (Look for White Box).  I really like these over the ones shipped in my Alice 3D Bundle.  Lighter Weight, Wider View and no more batteries! We both where glasses and either model battery or rechargeable are comfortable!Last Pro: Amazon Video applets on both models!

First of all this reviewer has NO interest in 3D and never anticipates changing.  Plasma still has issues unless you get into expensive sets, and the same is true to an even worse degree with LED not being uniform due to edge lighting.  If the budget is low, would recommend most people to stay with the LCD <hard to find the bigger sizes that are not LED>  If you feel like gambling a little,, look at the reviews on Plasma, particularly Panasonic and make up your own mind.On to the Sony 46XBR929 which is their flagship TV.  It is unfortunate that in 2012, Sony  has dropped the 46\" size for this model <only get 55\" and 60\">.  However, if you do some research you will find Sony's 2012 TV lineup is the same as it was for 2011 due to the TV market and their financial picture, limiting research into offering new features <and when you consider the XBR feature list,  WHAT is there to add?  If Sony didn't list that there was no audio out for analog, I might have taken away a STAR but when it is clearly advertised by them, how can you take away from your review for the Lack of a Feature you wanted?  Part of that potential loss of a Star would  have been the silly dongle for Video red/green/blue and audio RED/ White <analog> input instead of just having the plugs on the back of the TV.  MY B&O; sound system may be analog, but I would put it up against some pretty expensive digital sound systems even if it is over 22 years old and having to use a 3.5mm pin to R/W analog Y-splitter plugged into a headphone jack to source the TV's audio through the B&O; equipment, Sucks.  Really Sony, on the flagship TV, going cheap on the number of plugs on the back of the TV.YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND A BETTER PICTURE.  Sony XBR LED in 929 series is using a fully background lite system instead of just an EDGE Lit system.  BLACK is blacker than the bottom of a deep mine shaft and totally uniform.  Colors, without doing any customizing, is amazing and very natural.  My 40\" is a mid-level Sony <40v2500> with a good picture.  the XBR929 unit is truly GREAT when coming to picture quality.  Sound is typical for most TV's today; however, most I feel will be plugging into a 5.1 or 7.1 audio system and likely through a HVR.  The one I use comes from Yamaha <RX-V867 which I highly recommend as internet AV receiver that does the job well>  The XBR has all the Dolby audio, HD audio programs you could want built in.  The Vendor I bought from since Amazon did not have the discontinued model is the same offering a new unit as this review is written did well is packaging the factor Sony box and using FedEx, the Sony arrived in normal condition.  WORTH THE MONEY?  You get what you pay for.  This is a lot to pay for a TV; however, my choice was to get just a 46\" size Sony to have the XBR, instead of having a 55\" something else in Plasma or the cheaper Sony line that is edge lit.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony great", "Author": "Payahlaba7", "ReviewID": "R1RLOTY95BRCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WoW great tv best of the best.

Bruce told me that the SU-WL700 had all the accessories  that I would need to mount my set to the wall and supplied me with a link to the WALL mount's operating instructions.I replied to \"Bruce\" that I AM NOT TRYING TO MOUNT MY TELEVISION TO THE THE WALL,explained in even GREATER DETAIL what the problem was, and thanked him in advance for COMPLETE attention to my request.Then I received a response from \"Jared\".He \"understands my concern regarding the mounting holes on the TV\" and refered me to page 11 of the user guide.Well, what's on page 11?INSTRUCTIONS FOR MOUNTING SONY'S SUPPLIED TABLE STAND TO THE TV,NOT A WIT ABOUT THE PROFORMA'S MOUNTING OPTION OR compatibility.These fellows obfuscate and pass the buck far too much for what they are employed to represent:a premium product sold at a PREMIUM PRICE.In fact, I'm taking off another star because I'm so burnt up about spending $349.99 for a table that I can't make full use of.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture quality, few software glitches", "Author": "Pablo", "ReviewID": "R3CRWJK75T18FV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The BRAVIA XBR55HX929 55\" 3D Full Aray LED with Local-Dimming has excellent picture quality.

In four different seemingly random times, it showed diagonal stripes that lasted about 15 minutes. I chose not to return the product as I believe it was EM interference triggered by some appliance plugged in the same power grid, but it worries me a little it may be a defect.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good tv, bad shipping", "Author": "Jamie", "ReviewID": "R1CDEMXQ31FJS8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The tv works good and sounds good.

Having fallen for it's dashing looks, I had to have one. I forked out the whopping 6 Grand for this set and have been nothing but dissapointed. The colors are very artificial and despite every effort to calibrate this thing into delivering natural colors I gave up and excepted that this technology is just not ready to take on plasmas in color reproduction. Also the motion is jittery and cartoon like. Aside form that my biggest issue is with screen uniformity. This set has the worst banding I have ever seen. I just couldn't live with 2x vertical bands running through center screen about 2 inches apart plus several fainter ones on either side. I contacted Sony support (Wow what a bunch of idiots they all are) They were rude and completely incapable of assisting me. They insisted that I send them photos of the problem. They called a few days later and told me that this was normal and I would just have to live with it. Luckily for me I was within the 30 day return period. After researching further I found that this is a common problem with this TV and I experimented in several stores to replicate the problem. They all had it. My 65HX929 is being returned for a full refund and I will never buy a Sony again until I see they they have fixed there sloppy manufacturing and there appalling customer service. I would like to add that there Better Business rating is a big fat F where as companies like Apple and Panasonic score an A+. Sony know this and do nothing to improve there image here. My resolve was to get my money back and I took delivery of a stunning Panasonic 65 VT50 yesterday and so far I am blown away. I will post again to update my opinion of the Panasonic.I hope this will help some of you make a more informed decision on your next HDTV.Nicole", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do I need to buy additional warranty for Sony Bravia XBR55HX929?", "Author": "maya", "ReviewID": "RS4VXGT0926HT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased Sony Bravia XBR55HX929 from Best Buy.

I hooked it up and seconds later saw a nice scratch in the gorilla glass screen - how??  I'm working to arrange a replacement.  The scratch isn't huge so I'm using it right now.  It looks loads better than the 32'' 1080i JVC 5 year old TV it replaced.  I have the 55'' inch version.  I'm wishing there was an even larger set available heh.  I think bigger is better.  Anyway I'm pretty disappointed with the scratch in the screen and I've had 3 Sony products in the past couple months with 3 returns for replacements.  Seriously.  I thought this company was better.  I hate returning stuff it's such a hassle.  When I get the replacement and I get a chance to really play with it I'll expand this review.  Right now I'm just bummed over the scratch and the hassle involved.  Everyone talks about how important the black levels are on these LCD TV's.  Some people have said that the blacks on this set blend right into the plastic borders on the sides.  Not so for me but I haven't done any adjusting of the screen.  I haven't even opened the remote control since I'm just sending it back.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV except the chinese characters support", "Author": "Hock L.
