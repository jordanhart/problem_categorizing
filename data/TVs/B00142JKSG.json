{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Panasonic 800 Series HDTV Review & Configuration Help", "Author": "Sean C. Stephens \"Sean The HD Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R2C6R6OEV5VPXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My hope is that this review will come across as credible after a brief introduction revealing my technical background.  I have been a home theater enthusiast since 1995 and ran a small video and independent film business from 1996 - 2001.  This review and check list are based on both personal research and professional experience.  If you do not wish to read  this entire review, feel free to scroll to the bottom where I have created a systematic checklist that will enable any Panasonic 800 series HDTV to maximize its fullest potential.  More specifically, I will attempt to draw upon the televisions abilities when viewing Blu-ray movies which, to date, offer the best HD image quality and upgradeable potential.If you factor tax and delivery, I bought the TH-50pz800U Plasma for about $700 less than retail and it performs great.  The best-upgraded features on 2008/09's Panasonic 800 series include the 24p playback for Blu-ray movies and 100,000-hour lifespan of the display itself.Why the 100,000-hour lifespan is importantThis feature was a major selling point for me because I wanted a Plasma due to LCD's poor dark color reproduction but was worried about the shorter lifespan of most Plasma's which is typically only 30,000 to 70,000 hours.  However, this baby specs out at 100,000, which is equal to 8 hours per day for over 34 years.  Unheard of for Plasma displays until the 800 series arrived in April.Why 24p is importantAlthough this HDTV supports a variety of features that will be better utilized in the next stage of HD technology 24p is here now.  Currently only Blu-ray and a variety of high-end camcorders are capable of outputting 24p content.  What is 24p?  In a nutshell 24p is the frame rate in which images are displayed on your TV or Computer screens.  A 24p capable system can display video at 24 frames per second rather than  succumbing to display a converted video signal at 30 frames per second.  This is important because all Hollywood films are shot and later projected in theaters at 24 frames per second.  After theatrical release, studios then convert their films to 30 frames per second and ship them to the home video markets as well as television broadcast networks.  This conversion process is known as 3:2 pull down and it means that you ultimately lose several frames as they are blended together to display at 30 frames per second.  This is why you sometimes will not see smooth motion when you fast forward or rewind DVD's.  Once a Blu-ray begins, be sure to use your TV remote to enter the advanced custom picture options and select 48Hz (a factor of 24) rather than 60Hz under the \"24p Direct In\" field.  The instructions to set this up are included in the checklist at the end of this article.  At first, you may notice a slight flicker but after your eyes adjust, you will feel as though a State of the Art film projector is rolling your favorite movies right in your living room.  When you are done with 24p content, the TV will switch back to 30 frames per second (60Hz) automatically.Future ProofThe other features available with the 800 series Panasonic's are intriguing but will not be able to dazzle you until media technology catches up.  For example, this TV supports Deep Color, which is technically the next step up from True Color.  True Color is the color depth standard that has been output to computer displays for years.  Deep Color enables many more variations of color.  Unfortunately, nothing on the market except for a few high-end camcorders output images utilizing this advanced color pallet.  It is safe to assume that Blu-ray movies will do so in the future because of there massive storage capabilities.  For PS3 owners you will need to turn on the \"Super-White\" feature under \"Display Settings\" to enable this functionality.  It took a bit of research but essentially \"Super-White\" is Sony's name for Deep Color.  Again, detailed instructions for setting up this feature can be found at the end of this review.Many websites and message boards claim that Deep Color will not be a big deal when it finally arrives because its full potential is impossible to detect.  What this means is that although Deep Color will offer several thousand additional color variations the human eye will only be able to differentiate about 360 of them.  Still, further research will reveal that those 360 additional shades essentially push the entire color pallet of the human eye to its limits.  In other words, all the real time color data that went into establishing the next shot of a film appears in front of you exactly as it did for the director.  No visible shade of color gets lost or fades when put through the eventual electronic transfer process.Do you remember when HDTV first came out?  The early reviews claimed that the picture was so clear it was like looking through a window.  Well, theoretically Deep Color will bring this statement to life because for the first time in history an electronic image will be able to reproduce every single color that is recognizable to the human eye.ConclusionThe 800 series of Panasonic displays are the perfect solution for consumers looking to add a long-term home theater display to their arsenal.  The set is ready for features that have potential to become more of an HD standard in the years to come.  The product line is truly future proof and ready to adjust to the rapidly evolving HD industry.  If you are like me, you may also be considering the only other real competition in the high-end Plasma HDTV market, Pioneer.  If so, consider this; beginning next year Pioneer will no longer continue developing their HD product line from scratch.  Instead, they will be outsourcing for raw plasma displays and then tweaking them.  Where will they get these raw displays?  You guessed it, Panasonic.Checklist to maximize this TV's PerformanceIf you wish to enable feature 5 you may need to toggle between \"Size 1\" and \"Size 2\" for maximum visuals during Blu-ray Screenings/Video Gaming (Size 2) and all other viewing (Size 1)1. Connect your Blu-ray player or PS3 using a Category 2 HDMI cable to ensure that you are ready for future Deep Color support as well as current support for a broader color space through x.v.Color.  Be sure to connect this device to the first HDMI port labeled \"HDMI 1\" in the input menu.  If you search Amazon by entering:  Category 2 HDMI, you will find several affordable options.a. HINT:  Expensive name brand cables make no difference when transferring a digital signal and do not improve picture quality.  Digital signals are either present or not present.  There is no such thing as a weak digital signal.  That is why the world is moving away from analog and switching to digital.  All data that travels through an HDMI cable is 100% digital.b. You want to use the first HDMI port because it is possible that the HDTV bases its HDMI compatibility for future devices on the first port.  In other words if you do not install the device with the most compatibility into the first HDMI port then your Blu-ray player may be limited to the specifications of whatever device ends up getting plugged into the first HDMI port.2. Set the television's picture mode to \"Custom\" from the display menu.a. HINT:  If you use the other picture modes (i.e. \"Game,\" \"THX\") you will not be able to turn 24p and other advanced features specific to Blu-ray.  However, you can always manually adjust the \"Custom\" levels (i.e. brightness, color, and tint) to match the other picture modes and you will get identical results.  You may even wish to have the \"Custom\" levels professionally calibrated although these options are often a matter of personal taste.  I find the default \"Custom\" display levels to be sufficient with a slight tint level adjustment towards the green end of the spectrum.3. Turn on your PS3 or Blu-ray player and enable Deep Color support.  You will only need to enable this on the initial setup.a. HINT:  Deep Color support may also be labeled \"Super White,\" \"x.v. color,\" \"RGB Full or Wide,\" and \"xvYCC.\"  Although x.v.color, xvYCC, and RGB Full settings are not technically the same as Deep Color they do increase the color spectrum and can most easily be thought of as a stepping-stone towards the realism of Deep Color.  In addition, when Deep Color becomes available most players will automatically support Deep Color when these options are on.4. Leave your PS3 or Blu-ray player on and prepare to adjust a couple settings within the \"Custom\" picture mode you enabled during step 2.  You will only need to make the following adjustments on the initial setup:a. Set the \"x.v. color\" option to \"Auto.\"i. HINT: This option requires you to scroll to the second page within the \"Custom\" picture mode settingsb. While your Blu-ray player is turned on with any title playing select the \"advanced picture\" option from the \"Custom\" picture mode menu and select \"48Hz\" from the \"24p Direct In\" field.  The TV will automatically adjust you back to \"60Hz\" when you finish watching a Blu-ray movie.  In addition, it will automatically go back to \"48Hz\" when you put back in a Blu-ray movie.i. HINT:  If 48Hz is not available to select make sure that your Blu-ray player or PS3 has the most recent firmware update and that the movie is playing beyond the previews and preliminary copyright warnings.  If your player is connected to the internet, the most recent firmware update should be installed automatically by selecting the players \"check for update\" option.  For Blu-ray devices not connected to the internet or those that do not include and \"update\" option search the manufacturers website for a downloadable update which can be burnt to a CD and installed manually.  Although most players, PS3 included, have 24p enabled automatically, you may be required to enable it from within your players video output options.  Setting the Hz output to any factor of 24 enables 24p (i.e. 24Hz, 48Hz, 72Hz, 96Hz, and 120Hz).5. This step is optional, however, should be completed in order to maximize the potential of the current Blu-ray disc specification and the 800 series HDTV.  Under the \"advanced picture\" settings within the \"Custom\" menu, you can select \"Size 2\" from the \"HD size\" field.  By selecting \"Size 2,\" you will reveal 5% more picture that is available on all Blu-ray discs and most current generation video games.  Most Blu-ray players, the PS3 included, support this and if they do not you will see video noise (fuzz) around one edge of the picture, usually the top of the screen, or obvious black bars on the right and left sides.  This noise DOES NOT harm your TV in any way so do not be afraid to experiment.  After this option is set, the image size will remain fixed until you select \"Size 1\" again.  If you elect to use this option chances are you will use \"Size 2\" for Blu-ray titles and games while switching back to \"Size 1\" for everything else (i.e. DVD and Cable/Satellite Broadcasts.Panasonic Viera TH-50PZ800U 50-inch 1080p Plasma HDTVPanasonic Viera TH-42PZ800U 42-inch 1080p Plasma HDTVPanasonic TH 50PZ750U - 50\" plasma TV - widescreen - 1080p (FullHD) - HDTVPanasonic TH-58PZ700U 58-inch 1080p Plasma HDTV", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied", "Author": "Barry Moore", "ReviewID": "R2DGZDGFUT2BVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy customer.

It's been flawless and still looks as good as the day I hung it up.---------------Panasonic Viera TH-50PZ800U 50-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTVReviewed June 28, 2008 - Owned for 45 daysUpdated November 2008 - still lovin this TV and haven't seen anything in the price range that beats it. About to buy one for my dad.PICTURE QUALITYI can not say anything negative about the picture quality... it's a ten for today's technology.SOUNDI dealt with a Panasonic rep when I made a deal on the 800U and he indicated that the sound was superior to the PH-50PX60U I already had... yeah, it's a tad better but not by much. My 14 year old Sony KV-27HFR tuber still blows them away in sound. But I guess most people don't use their flat panel TV for sound like I do... this ones in the bedroom and I don't have an audio system hooked up to it.BEAUTYThe cabinet is nice... much nicer than I expected. It's got that sheet of glass front rather than several inches of bezel protruding around the glass that most flat panel TVs have nowadays. There is maybe a 1/4 inch low-profile black bezel around the glass front... very new looking. There is still a 3-inch bezel surrounding the picture tube (if that's what they still call them) - but it's underneath the sheet of glass front so when the TV is off it looks much nicer than that standard bezel look.ANTI-GLARE SCREENThe anti-glare screen is better than my PH-50PX60U... but not much. Don't expect it to be much of an improvement. One thing I did notice is that from the side, you don't as much depth in the double images... not much to comment on but it is another improvement. Cleaning the screen can and is hard to do. I used regular Windex after testing a small area. Using a soft micro-fiber cloth, it took  a lot of reapplying Windex to get the finger smudges off the screen. Our hands left a lot of finger prints from hanging the TV. If you don't get the fingerprints completely cleaned off - then they leave an iridescent sheen on the screen that quite visible. This kinda reminds me of the anti-glare coatings on camera lenses.MPG VIEWERThe TH-50PZ800U has a decent MPG viewer... it's not great but it's a step better because it \"can\" fill the screen now. Pictures don't get shrunk - they just display as-is. I've started cropping mine with ACDSee or Photoshop at 1920x1080 so they fit perfectly. This year is a big improvement over the older viewer SW they had before. Controls via the remote are minimal... seems like you can start, stop and move forward & backward... and set the slide show delay in seconds.The picture viewer on my old PH-50PX60U was lame. Even though I would feed it a 2272x1704 picture - it would shrink it down to about 1/2 the size of the screen... grrr. Guess back then they didn't have any good SW engineers working at Panasonic.TV ERGONOMICSAbout as nice as you can get for a plasma today. Black rounded back that doesn't look bad when seen from the side. The front panel that folds down so you can access the SD memory slot is ok... but again, I give Panasonic  a ding in the design - why did you not recess the SD slot a bit more so I could close the door when the SD memory card is inserted but not pushed in? Why oh why Panasonic guy??? This means that I can not store my SD card with my reformatted pics \"in\" the TV's SD slot... unless of course I leave the door cover open. Oh well. And why don't they give us a little slot under the door that holds a dozen or so of the SD cards... I've got 10 or so now and would like to use the smaller ones to organize my pics... and keep them in the TV. Oh well.WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR NUMBER 1The front panel swings up to expose some external connectors and the important TV controls - just in case the dog carries the remote away.Menu TV OK/Video v-Vol-^ v-Channel-^1-S-video connector1-Video L-Sound-R (RCA PLUGS)1-HDMI connector1-SD memory card slotSERVICE & MY DOG EARSDon't know if it's just me or what - but after the TVs been on a while, I begin hearing a high pitched noise coming from the TV. Kind of like a low pitch noise you hear from a transformer outside - but at the high frequency end. Mute the sound and it's less but still there. Turn up the sound and it louder. In fact, this is why I have the 800U... the noise from the old 60U was driving me crazy. But I must say that the local Panasonic customer service rep was great and he replaced the TV for me near the end of the 1 year warranty. I just paid a couple of hundred dollars and upgraded to 1080p. Again - Panasonic service was top notch! But if you haven't seen inside a 50 plasma yet, let me tell you - there's a whole lot of 2-inch high voltage capacitors in there... enough to make some serious high pitched electronic hum for sure. Don't let this sway you from a decision on this - no one else hears it but me... hence the dog ears.CONNECTIONSIt's got everything I want... just check the published specs. The only thing I would recommend they change next time is to angle the connectors on the back down a bit so things like the HDMI plug don't stick out so far. This would allow the tilting wall mount to tilt down a bit more - right now it's resting the connectors against the wall. Not a big deal just a suggestion for Panasonic next year.REMOTEThe remote mostly sucks in the normal remote ways, ie, the ergonomics, functions and button positions are poorly laid out. And where the frig did the sleep timer button go - it existed on my PH-50PX60U remote. So guess what - I'm using my old remote for the new TV... just for the sleep timer function... that's the only reason I pick it up. For everything else I use my FIOS TV Motorola QIP6416-1 DVR remote... but like most all remotes - it does not have a sleep button either - grrr.FINAL CONCLUSIONOverall TV satisfaction... a 10.Suggestion for next years model - get some decent ergonomics engineers on staff and build the worlds first award winning remote :)", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazon and Panasonic Deliver!", "Author": "Alan Walsh \"fanazon\"", "ReviewID": "R2R7Y3FQPT2AQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was one of the folks who jumped on the \"pre-order\" sale back in early spring, before Panny was actually shipping product. I had narrowly missed the amazing Panasonic Plasma/Blu-Ray deal a few weeks earlier, so I was determined not to miss out. As soon as I saw the price I jumped.First things first: as many others have reported it was not until late May before Amazon received units from Panasonic. Nonethless, I am happy to report that after \"confirming\" my order and agreeing to the slight delay, I was surprised in early June with a shipping notice. My unit arrived within a week - well ahead of estimated schedule.The delivery itself was fantastic. A very pleasant young lady called me one evening to schedule delivery. I picked the day I wanted and she told me it would arrive between 10 and 2. They called me about 30 minutes out and arrived right in the middle of their delivery window at about noon. After a quick check for damage I was assembling the pedestal stand. I can't recommend the delivery and service enough.Oh yeah - the TV! What can I say, the Panny delivers the goods and far exceeds expectations. You know the specs, so I won't bother repeating them here. I do want to mention how nice it is to look on the back and see 3 HDMI ports (the 4th is up front). It also has a digital out for sound, which is both convenient and necessary IMO. My one disappointment is with the built in speakers. Not enough oomph for me, but I may just be spoiled by my own surround setup.I have seen this very unit in the store and I was blown away when I hooked it up to DirecTV and began sampling. I have at this point seen all the HD channels that D*TV provides and the only way I can describe it is breathtaking. Literally. I found myself watching some of the programming with my mouth wide open. The colors are amazing. I was slightly concerned that even a latest generation plasma would lack the punch that I had seen from some of the nicer LCDs in stores. No need to worry - the improvements in this year's model will blow you away. I was lucky enough to watch the Stanley Cup (game 7), the NBA Finals, and The U.S. Open all in HD, and I can attest to the superb quality for live sports. Movies and other programming will never be the same after watching them on this TV. I caught a repeat of SNL the other night and it was almost creepy how crisp and realistic the picture was.The unit itself is gorgeous. I might have to get a new house to match my TV. :-) I started with a pedestal and have since moved on to wall mounting. Both were a breeze, although the unit is heavy enough to require two people to lift.SD programming is good, although I have developed a very strong bias for HD content, so I find myself watching a lot less of that. I also hooked up my 480p DVD player and I am pleasantly surprised with the performance. I can't wait to get my hands on a Blu-Ray to see what 1080P and 24p playback will look like.I have to get back to my TV now...", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Viera TH-50PZ800U  KURO KILLER", "Author": "JIM BOB", "ReviewID": "R10CB2GK0Y3DHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had high expectations when I bought this Panasonic. After reading about every possible candidate plasma & LCD, I took the plunge on this newly released 800U. It exceeded my expectations and they were pretty high expectations.

[...].PICTURE - I've only watched upscaled standard DVDs (via HDMI from a very fine Oppo player) on it and the picture has been outstanding.  I am seeing details in movies that I've never seen though I've watched them several times.  I use CNET's settings in THX mode, toned down while the screen is breaking in (the first 100-200 hours).AUDIO - Is good for TV speakers.INSTALL - Make sure that you don't set the TV down when you first open the box unless you're setting it on the stand.  There were no directions on this so I was (unpleasantly) surprised when the 100 pound set wouldn't balance on the bottom edge and nearly crushed the lower \"lip\"!NOISE - There is a buzzing noise that comes from the circuit boards in back, below the fans.  The noise varies depending on what's on screen, it's loudest when the screen is bright.  I called Panasonic and a technician examined the set and said the noise was normal for a plasma.  He said LCDs are quieter.  I welcome any solutions anyone might have to this problem.I can only give this otherwise excellent TV three stars because such an expensive and high quality AV device should not emit a background noise that interferes with its normal use.  If I had known about \"plasma noise\" I would have bought a high-end LCD but now I am stuck with this TV.

I researched plasmas to the point that it was becoming a joke in my family. It was difficult to find my choices in one store for side-by-side comparisons. I had it narrowed down to the Panasonic th50pz85u, th50pz800u, Samsung pn50a550 and pn50a650.One store had 3 of them, so after I found the remotes, I stayed an hour and played with the picture and audio settings. The th50pz800u had a bias because of the cnet review, and several other professional reviews that were very good. Customer satisfaction was very high, also. The picture on this set blew the other ones away, as did the audio. 2 stores had this TV hooked up to home theater setups, and the TV audio was disabled. I thought this was more than coincidence because the other TV's didn't come close to this models sound. It seems they were trying to sell an add-on that was not needed. I finally decided the savings through Amazon was worth taking a chance for. A day after placing my order, the price dropped $119.00. I knew Amazon no longer had the 30 day price guarantee, but I called them anyway to complain. My unit wasn't even shipped yet, hadn't shown up on my credit bill, and it was already discounted. I talked to a young man named Pritish, who was very professional, understanding, and courteous enough to give me the discount. Bravo Amazon. I won't be shy about buying from you in the future. Pilot delivery called the day before delivery, which was the original date of 8 days from purchase. I verified that the men would wait while I set up the TV to make sure everything was working correctly, and that they would remove the box and packing. The man told me only one person was assigned for the delivery, but yes, he would wait and remove. (One person wasn't what I wanted to hear having had rotator cuff surgery recently.) The man came in the middle of the 5 hour window, we unloaded the TV, and he was ready to get to his next delivery. Whem I informed him that I verified that he had to wait until I got the TV turned on, he said he couldn't. He was surprised about taking the packing material also. I was insistant, and he relented. I downloaded a slide show on avs to help with the breakin period, and I ran it for 6 days, with the video settings turned down very low. I was anxious to get this over with and enjoy my TV. I'm still careful with the settings because some stations (shame on you,ESPNHD) have such a bright, stationary logo and I worry about image retention. I watch most programs in the THX mode, and everyone who views this TV marvel at the picture quality. SD isn't bad, but I, too, have become an HD snob. I ordered an additional package from my cable provider so I can watch HD 90% of the time. Makes me wonder why I waited so long to join the revolution! I did have to play with the audio settings, but I have them set to where it sounds great to me, and the others who hear it. I live in an apartment, and did't want a theater setup to anger the neighbors. Bottom line, I love this TV. I'm glad I researched so carefully, probably 100 hours or more. I can save you some of that time, if you're considering this model. Buy it! You won't be disappointed.

Lets ignore that it is rating the one of the top 2 plasmas in the world (yet again), and lets ignore all the other TV's with different bragging rights for whatever features for the moment and call it all equal.What truely sets this unit aside is its new frame design. No other TV on the market (YET) has an all glass front surface and is nearly FRAMELESS.Thats right, the entire front viewing area, and the black portion that other TV's have as high gloss raised plastic frame, the Panasonic has painted the glass from behind and uses a thin strip of bent steel to frame the glass. Whats left is the whole front being ANTI-REFLECTIVE.There is no glossy frame to catch various light from various angles. Its the most impressive design IMO, and thats the #1 reason why I recommend this TV.

Although we have a 26 inch Westinghouse LCD in the bedroom, we were replacing an old Sony CRT with this. So, this is essentially our first foray into HDTV. Here are my first impressions after having had the tv for a couple weeks:SETUP:  I have the screen measured at 8 feet from where we sit. For the TV signal, we have DISH with the 722 receiver (@1080i). We also have a new Panasonic BD-35K Blu Ray player. We don't have any receiver or sound set up yet. Also, the sticker on the back of the TV says that it was manufactured in November 2008, so I guess it was fresh off the assembly line. Maybe it has the latest firmware?PICTURE SETTINGS:  Also, during the break-in period, the picture settings are:  Picture Mode: THX;  Picture:  +55; Brightness:+52; Color: +50; Tint: 0; Sharpness +50; Color Temp: Warm; Black Level: Light (although I've used Dark extensively also).24P/FLICKER ISSUE:  Regarding the 24fps input/Flicker issue: I set up the TV to accept 24fps (actually the tv setting is 48). I've looked very hard to try to discern flicker on a number of different disks, but so far I have not seen any.1080P (BLU-RAY) vs. 1080i (DISH): First off, the 1080p on the Blu-Ray looks amazing. I don't see any flicker, and the resolution is tack sharp. But the real eye-opener is the 1080i from the DISH 722: At 8 feet, I can discern the difference between different HD stations. HDNet/HD Theatre/National Geographic/The Travel Channel all look tack sharp also, just like with the Blu-Ray player. The TV is good enough that I can tell when the HD stations on DISH either have a lower resolution, or more commonly, are overly compressed (you see more artifacts and noise which is especially apparent in parts of the picture which are out of focus like backgrounds). So the weak link is stations which choose to overly compress their signal.PROCESSING OF STANDARD (NON-HD) TV SIGNAL:  Compared to the LCD we have (which must be first or second generation, because it suffers from each and every one of those flaws they say LCD has...), the Panasonic 50PZ800U processes standard TV very well.  That being said, you would never actually want to watch non-HD programming on this TV, because, after watching any HD signal, watching non-HD becomes very disturbing. Nevertheless, compared to our LCD, the processing of the standard signal is as noise-free as I could reasonably expect.  The only thing we watch in standard now are the History Channel International (no-HD version available yet), and the road Lakers games, as DISH doesn't carry the HD version of their local channel.  As an aside, having this TV did make the experience of watching road Lakers games miserable, as non-HD is not a pleasant experience once you've gotten excited by the HD games.MOTION:  Motion is fine, as I expected with Plasma. (The LCD we have upstairs is horrendous).BLACK LEVELS:  they are very dark (but I haven't calibrated-- I simply put the thing on THX/Warm/and Black levels on Dark). Black levels on light might work better for shadow detail.  We lose a little bit of shadow detail on the Dark setting, and the Light setting  has a little less punch (less contrast, I guess).  We'll have to revisit this and try to play with the calibration settings once I reach 150 or 200 hours.REFLECTIONS:  Having had a CRT, I can say that the reflections are probably exactly what we used to get on the Sony CRT (funny how we never used to complain about that sort of thing back then...)All in all, I love this TV.  The one weakness I can see is the black level/shadow detail tradeoff (the black levels are fine on the Dark setting, but you lose something on the Light setting.)  I am confident that this can be tweaked or calibrated to improve it.

True to form, the black levels are excellent, the color accuracy is very good right out of the box, and the set itself is gorgeous.  I love the single-sheet-of-glass design and do not find too much fault with the strip of plastic (metal?) that runs around the edge of the set.  I ordered through Amazon and was very pleased with the experience from them (the best price, period) and the shipping company Pilot (got it a few days early, in perfect condition, and the guys were nice).  I have the set picking up over-the-air (OTA) signals from an attic antenna, and have a Panasonic '35K Blu-Ray player and Apple TV running through a Yamaha 'V663 receiver via HDMI.What would I liked to have known that I didn't really see while shopping around?1.  The anti-reflective screen really isn't.  Before sunset, the set picks up reflections off anything in the room that catches the slightest bit of daylight.  Prepare to dodge glare while watching during the day, or to do some mitigation at the windows.2.  I'm using the pedestal base, which is nice enough and swivels a bit, but it is a real dust magnet.  It's like it is permanently statically charged.3.  So far I have not been able to find a program guide for OTA DTV stations like my $40 set-top-box has.  Not a big deal, and maybe I just haven't found it, but it seems like a silly omission.  And maybe I'm the silly one for running a 50\" plasma basically on \"rabbit ears,\" but the OTA signals are wonderful and I do not see the need to pay for more programming.  If you have satellite or cable, the lack of a program guide is probably a non-issue.4.  Yes, there is noise emitted from the set (a buzzing much like a fluorescent light ballast) but on my particular unit, I haven't found it to be noticeable at all unless I am standing at the unit, looking behind it.  If you lived in a rural area, on a still night, where absolutely no other noise was generated in the room, I guess you would be able to hear the set during silent passages in a movie.  Not a big deal at all in my opinion.5.  If you sit any closer than ten feet from the set, the 50-inch size may be too big for you.

I've worked in retail electronics for 9 years now and this is hands down the best TV I have ever seen.Not only is this a great looking TV, it's designed better than most. Panasonic makes there own panels. Panasonic uses twice as many drivers in their panels as some other leading manufactures. Panasonic is the only manufacture of televisions you're going to find in your typical chain brick and mortar store that actually cared to seek out the coveted THX certification. They also happen to be the only one to ever build a 150\" plasma that works. That said, let's get to the nitty gritty.Contrast - 30,000:1 native contrast ratio and 1,000,000:1 dynamic. This means your brights will be brighter and your darks will be darker. With all the lights off in your viewing room watching a movie with lot's on contrast can make the outer border of your TV chassis all but disappear. You'll swear you're right there next to Batman!480Hz Sub Field Drive - those drivers we talked about earlier, they sample incoming signal 480 times per second. . . beat that LCD. You can keep your stupid 120Hz \"True Motion plus\" junk.Viera Link HDAVI Control - This is a serious geek feature. For those of you with an HDMI equipped device like a Panasonic Blu Ray player or an Onkyo audio receiver you'll be able to control these external devices with the TV's remote. There are limits to what you can do with the TV's remote in this type of set up, but it's just awesome to be able to adjust volume on your receiver using the TV's remote when the receiver is locked away in an unseen closet.THX Certified - There's a list of about 20 requirements that a TV must meet in order to obtain the display certification from THX. The fact is, there are plenty of great TV's out there that could probably get this certification, but, they didn't. The THX mode in this TV adjusts the picture settings to replicate the settings used during the certification process, you may like the way it looks, you may not. But it's a good option to start with when getting your TV set up for your room and viewing conditions.Some other features not mentioned in the regular lit you may find: This uses less power than comparable televisions it's size. There are four cooling fans at the top of the unit to cool the panel. Front HDMI input in case your buddy brings over their console gaming system and you don't want to take it off the wall.Recommendations:1. Buy this TV.2. Spring for the 58\" if you're thinking about it.3. Get to know your menus, play with picture settings, customize your display to suite your room and your tastes.4. Forget about component video, S-Video and composite. HDMI is the present. It's no longer only the \"wave of the future.\"5. Go Blu Ray. Just about any decent quality Blu Ray player paired with this TV will make all of your old DVD's look better than you've ever seen. The upsampling process of the TV makes you just swear everything you watch is HD. . .well it ain't. The TV is just that good.Conclusion: In case you haven't noticed when it comes to this TV, I am a fan. And No, I don't work for Panasonic. A great friend of mine, his father, my father and myself all own this TV. I'm an advocate to say the least. I guarantee that if you take the plunge and purchase this TV it will be the best TV you've ever owned.

Amazon's price, selection, delivery and set up were all wonderful. I will never consider Best Buy again.- Amazon also had (by far) the best deal on HDMI cables.

I have a friend that has a 1080p LCD TV and it does not hold a candle to the overall picture quality of this plasma.  Again, the one drawback to a plasma screen TV is that it has a glass front, so if you are planning on having this in a room with lots of light and window, reflections will be a problem, and you might choose an LCD.  But if you have a TV area like mine, hands down this is the best value and quality.  3 HDMI inputs (2 back, 1 front), 2 component inputs (1 back, 1 front) and your regular cable and composite hook ups available on back as well.  The menues are easy to navagate, and the remote is user friendly. This also has an SD card slot that can handle the SDHC cards up to 16gb so you can display your digital photos. The only thing I wish the TV did was on the picture slideshow it allowed you to play music (mp3 files) during the display like some photo frames.  Oh well, my pictures look excellent.

For the last 4 months, it has not powered back on after shutting it off and wanting to turn it on in a few minutes. It would blink twice repeatedly so I'd unplug and wait for 1 - 3 hours for it to cool down. Then, it would work so I'd leave it on unless I knew I'd be away for at least that long. I'd seen that this was a common problem with Panasonic HDTVs on many web sites and some suggested letting it sit. Yesterday, it happened again and I thought I'd give their online support a chat. Well, in troubleshooting the issue, the technician had me do a factory reset (hit - button by the volume while holding the Menu button on the remote) and then do a \"hard start\" which was holding the power button for 10 seconds. After that, it started blinking 10 times. Now, it doesn't work at all and Panasonic hasn't offered any compensation. It seems to me that when you pay $2600 for a TV it should last more than 3 years. I guess that is why they only offer 1 year labor/parts on their warranties.

Exactly 2 years + 1 month since purchase (fell just outside my extended warranty!!), I got a 3\" wide black bar running vertically on the left side of the TV - just looks like dead black space like a light back there went out.  Does not affect core picture in 4x3 format, but all pics in 16x9 aspect ratio (especially HD) are cutoff on the left side.  I went for help to various online forums; this is a common, known and well documented defect on these Panasonic plasma models, and the root cause is one of several circuit boards that has a short life and goes bad.  Panasonic knows about this defect, there is a class action consumer lawsuit against them, and customer service is unhelpful.  The actual defective board's replacement cost is $20-$30 on ebay, but make sure it's the right board.  The replacement is not easy - manual labor intensive, takes time, and slightly complex though online training forums can help.  I am turning to a plasma repair shop for help.  I was thinking of buying another Panasonic plasma for my living room but will now reassess whether to purchase at all.ORIGINAL REVIEW (Feb 2009):I have been researching plasmas for two years and upgraded from a 50\" Samsung DLP.  I was going to buy the 50PZ80U which Circuit City heavily discounted at the holidays, but my wife saw the picture of the Panasonic PZ800U and fell in love.  It costs $500 more than the PZ80U but the TVs are not comparable.  The PZ800U has amazing blacks, deep color, 24p native resolution, a 1M:1 contrast ratio (who does that?), an SD card slot, Viera-cast to use with my Panasonic BD35K Blu-Ray player, super easy-to-use features, and is just a beautiful elegant display.  My wife especially loves the dark single-pane glass bezel.  I monitored Amazon's price for three months and bought at almost $200 less than the average discounted price during a special two-day sale right before the Super Bowl.  I ordered on Jan 27th and had the TV delivered on Feb 1st (Saturday before the big game!) - great service and white glove delivery.Also check out the PZ850U which is another step up and is now selling for $150 less than where I bought the PZ800U.

Amazon had one of the best prices- when you get it directly from them. White glove delivery was as described. Two men brought the TV into my home, pulled it out of the box, set it up on my cabinet and we turned it on. They were going to take the packaging away, but I kept it in case something went wrong- so far, so good.The picture is excellent. Some people think that THX is too dark, but coming from a dark CRT (one of the reasons I wanted a new TV), I don't notice this at all. I keep it in THX the whole time. The sound is good, I don't have a separate speaker system yet.I was worried about reflections, but got a plasma for the unlimited viewing angle. I can see my living room reflected on the screen when it is off, but when watching TV during the day or at night, glare is not a problem. I like to have a light on in the evenings, except when watching a movie, and I did need to move the lamps around to avoid reflections.From a woman's perspective, 50inches is large and dominates a room. It is great for watching TV, but leaves its mark on your design scheme. It would probably leave less of a footprint if it was wall mounted. The bezel is wide and the lower lip is weird- if you're going to mention a possible flaw.I am happy with this television and I am pleased at the service and price from Amazon and would recommend them both.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "As expected.....excellent TV & great delivery and installation", "Author": "RichC \"Forever curious\"", "ReviewID": "R1YYO411TKH79A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a couple of hours watching TVs at Circuit City and Best Buys it came down to the this set.

The THX setting provides the nicest overall quality of colors for TV and movie (HD and DVD/Blu-Ray viewing).

Further, I also purchased the Panasonic BD-35 Blu-Ray player as I thought they would be well integrated via the Viesa linkage but have yet to see the benefit.  The player is excellent but once you put a disk in the player the set automatically swaps to that input which is neat but sometimes you want to finish watching something and let the disk load.The TV looks great with the single sheet of glass but it does pick up glare rather badly.

The THX mode is almost dead on with its settings, little needs to be changed.

An added bonus is that it is projected as possessing a 100,000 hour lifetime--seldom heard of in this market presently.  It has 4 HDMI inputs that will allow for future growth.  After one month I am delighted with the television and feel comfortable recommending it to anyone in the market.It is a beautiful television with a very dark screen (when off) surrounded by a black classy, nonintrusive bezel.  Mine sits on a swivel stand that comes with it although it could be easily mounted on a rear stand or wall.  It has a p.c. input and an SD card slot with Photo Viewer/Gallery Player software.  It also has a game mode function that automatically adjusts the image quality appropriate to game needs.I am not a techie so I will just mention that it 1920 X 1080 resolution with 5120 shades of gradation.  It represents a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio which is part of what Panasonic calls its \"Real Black\" system which seems highly impressive.  It has 24P native reproduction which will most be appreciated while watching Blu-Ray movies.For me, I find the contrast between a program or sports event on regular mode versus the same scenes on HDTV mode to be an incredible difference--a difference that makes the additional cost of a plasma screen to be well worth the cost.  There is amazing color reproduction with extremely high contrast ratios that produce brighter\" whites\" and darker \"blacks\".My Panasonic is slightly recessed where it is mounted so I have no problem with screen reflection of any kind; indeed, I find consistent and distortion free brightness from any viewing angle.  Similarly, as promised in Plasma screen televisions, there is very fluid, smooth and graceful movement in any program, sports event, or action sequence.This Panasonic carries the prestigious THX certification and once you watch an event in that mode you will not want to watch any other mode.  The \"Panasonic TH-50PZ800U\" has four speakers that provide decent quality sound reproduction when you are not running the TV through your sound system or a receiver.I can heartily recommend the \"Panasonic TH-50PZ800U\" to anyone seeking value, multiple features, and great performance in the current Plasma HDTV market.", "Date": "December 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best TV for the money!", "Author": "I Shop Online", "ReviewID": "RBKT3IBIR30TZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll keep it simple.

The tv was on the floor because I wanted to test it before mounting on the wall. When I bent over to unplug the tv my face was close to the screen and I could see a spider web of cracks in the screen that were not apparent from a distance.

I am not a manual reader and like to dig in and figure out how something works. The features and settings were relatively easy to use. It took some trial and error.I generally use the THX picture mode. I am not a gamer so the game mode was overly bright. Standard was too dark. There is a lot of room to customize your settings.  The set is a nice complement to my 7.1 audio system. Watching action movies with surround is great. The set is responsive to the action in the program.The recessed plugs in the back are helpful if you use a low profile mount but, as others have warned, make your connections prior to mounting. I am glad I read that advice. It was not difficult to mount with standard mounting hardware. I will be adding two more hdmi hookups so I will need to remove the tv from the wall to do so.I chose the 50\" model. If I had a do over I might go for the 58\" model.

I got a great deal (about 32% less than suggested retail) had in less than 2 weeks.  I mounted the TV and installed a new wiring kit to avoid calling in an electrician.  The install of the 50\" on my wall looks awesome; this TV looks great when it's turned off! When it came down to cleaning up the mess and watching TV/Blu-rays I was frustrated because I knew this TV had the ability to look much better than what I was experiencing.  I read at least 50 times that you just put it on THX mode and you're done. I found this NOT to be the case at all. It is definitely sharp in THX mode but so dark! The colors are terrible in this mode. I was getting really nervous because I knew this TV was not living up to its potential.  Has anyone else experienced this? `Game' mode was probably the best before I customized the `Custom' mode....see below.I then printed out the most helpful review from \"Sean The HD Guy\" and did all 5 steps he recommended in 'Custom' mode.  I am also using a PS3 for my Blu-ray.  This guy is awesome and obviously knows his stuff! I would hug this guy if I met him because he probably saved me $300 dollars to have a professional calibrator come in to tweak it.  The now `amped' up and correct picture is REDICULOUS and I love it! Blu-ray movies are scary in detail and I am finally getting the HD experience on cable that I have seen so many of my friends have. I had a 42\" Samsung plasma before and there is no comparison, although it was pretty decent with Blu-ray movies.In conclusion, I am a big fan of the TH-50PZ800u and I definately made the right decision. I am curious if anyone agrees with me when stating that the THX mode is terrible? I was really disappointed with it. Had this review not been posted on Amazon by \"Sean The HD Guy\" I would seriously doubt my purchase.

This bad boy has a sleek design and it's shiny frame looks very impressive. It's definitely a high end hdtv...until you turn it on. I don't know where to begin with my disappointment. I got a good deal on it, so the price is not what left me less then satisfied. The display itself is very overrated. It is difficult to get a crisp picture on this unit, and the THX mode that critics praise seems to leave a lot of pictures hazy and cloudy. I'm sure replicating \"true blacks\" is what a lot of video-philes loved about this set, but even the blacks seem more gray then truly black.I also read that the sound the set produces is above average. However, when I actually do use the sound that my Panasonic delivers, it sounds painful to my ears. I am not one that buys a television for it's audio qualities, but I am sending out a warning to those that might.Beyond the less-than-satisfactory qualities that I have mentioned above, my biggest qualm is with the reflective screen attached to the unit. My two biggest concerns while purchasing a plasma were burn-in (which to it's marketing department's credit, Panasonic has convinced me is not a big deal) and reflectivity. The reflection off the front of the tv does not seem to be a huge deal. It's a bit distracting, but overall it is not a deal breaker. HOWEVER, the reflection from INSIDE the tv is what I find incomprehensible for a modern-day television. From most angles (anything not directly in front of the tv), I notice a double image, or reflection, of the original picture. Maybe this is my fault because it's normal for plasma displays, but I find it utterly ridiculous that a modern day television that prides itself on viewing angles considers this to be par for the course. How can a tv actually deliver a \"crisp\" picture when everything it displays has a \"ghost\" behind it? Once again, I find this insulting to my intelligence.I'm sure my review will be ripped to shreds by all of those that consider this unit to be a work of art.

I checked the tracking number and it said that the tv was delivered. So I called again and was told the tv was delivered. Then they said it was given to another trucking company, I should call them. So I called them. They said the tv was delivered. Then they said it was given to yet another shipping company, I should call them. So I called them. You already know what they said. Then they decided they actually did have the tv and could bring it tomorrow. I actually no longer wanted the tv at this point, I was getting a little upset.

The box was in perfect condition, they brought it into the house, took it out of the box, and set it where I wanted. I got lucky.
