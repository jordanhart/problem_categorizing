In addition, the PRO-150FD's new video processor is the best I've seen for all HD sources; it minimizes distracting artifacts without sacrificing detail. If you're looking for the most pleasing plasma you can buy, and you can afford the steep $7,500 price, the PRO-150FD fills the bill and thus it earns our Editors' Choice award.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "KURO\nPIONEER 150FD PRO SIGNATURE SERIES\nPRO UNIT\nNew Panasonics Don't Compare\nPLASMA 60\" PIANO BLACK", "Name": "Pioneer Elite Pro-150FD 60' Plasma HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410En9OeoHL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BWZCSVQ"}}
