{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Comparing AppleTV to Roku2 XS", "Author": "Ghazi", "ReviewID": "RJ0BES0I3OHXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own both the new Apple TV (1080P/2012) model and the Roku2 XS. I found myself doing a side by side comparison of the two products and here are my findings.AppleTVPros: Works out of the box, minimum effort to setup, really easy to use interface + wifi. Can Restream old purchased episodes. Netflix App much cleaner and more superb. Streaming and buffering causes no delays or degradation of picture. AirPlay makes up for a lot of the limited channels (with Mountain Lion the functionality goes up even more). iPad Remote easy to useCons: Limited Channels...needs an open API like Roku to build more channelsRoku2 XSPros: Many Channels available, Cheaper ($10), Free Movie Channels like Crackle, AmazonPrime availability, Vendor neutral. iPad Remote easy to useCons: Missing iTunes integration, Poor quality and buffering (constant downgrading the image quality on NBA League Pass and Netflix). User UI is just bland and could be cleaner. Bugs and issues. Most channels you have to pay extra for. Roku disconnects from my wifi network randomly whereas the AppleTV never does during side by side streaming. Setup takes longer and more tweaking needed by the user.Summary:While the Roku offers you many more channels the end user experience on the AppleTV makes it much more simple to utilize. If you have some form of Apple Eco System then the AppleTV is for you. If you hate Apple then the Roku is for you. Each product has their own advantages and disadvantages. For me in the end it was about the user experience and ease of using the player and the AppleTV edged out. It's not to say I won't be using my Roku but until there are some updates to fix some of the buffers and issues the AppleTV is by far the better product.UPDATE: Completely Dropped my Roku in favor of Apple TV now. For some of the comments below I have a 30 Mbps down, 10 Mbps Up and being a network engineer and having quite an impressive armada of enterprise switches in the house I know it's not the network but the Roku. It's either the memory or the application code that keeps causing issues itself. Also for those that claim they cannot view movies due to apple protections...download airparrot and VLC. It works perfectly.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great at what it does but perhaps too limited", "Author": "William B. Partridge", "ReviewID": "R3G3AHMDON0BLZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an elegant and easy to use little box.  The interface is pretty, setup is dead simple (took less than 10 minutes from start to finish), and it's fairly intuitive to use.  The problem comes in that it doesn't serve a great deal of function, at least for me.Apple TV is essentially 3 main functions in one package.  iTunes front end, content/channel provider, and wireless display.On the face of it, Apple TV is a front end for iTunes and allows you to buy or rent content and view it on the box along with previously purchased content.  The usefulness of this is based on where you buy content.  If it's not iTunes then you can ignore most of it.  All the magic from this perspective is essentially gone for videos and even music doesn't work without iTunes Match.  You can alternatively access your media from another computer currently running iTunes, but only the content in iTunes (not a huge issue) and again, only when the computer is on and running (think of it like an iTunes extender).  The interface is lush and a joy to use but it's dependency on iTunes purchases or iTunes running on a computer diminishes the usefulness.  It'd be nice it it could access a network attached storage or something similar.The other content means are provided through channels/apps, like on a Roku box, but are limited to only 13.  Missing are the normal heavy hitters: Hulu Plus, HBO Go, Pandora, Slacker, Spotify, etc.  Only Netflix is present really, but what device doesn't have access to that?  I have 3 other devices connected to my receiver that can do it already and personally prefer the PS3 Interface.  The general feel of the channel/apps is also very smooth and works fast but some of them feel a bit long in the tooth, as if it could be better but in order to fit the overall design scheme it's not (again Netflix is an example).The final feature is AirPlay.  This is a feature that allows you to stream music and video from your MacOS and iOS device.  There's also AirPlay mirroring which takes what you see on your device (or computer once Mountain Lion is out) and puts it on the Apple TV.  It seems, based on the packaging, Apple is trying to play this up a lot and I'd agree with that goal.  It's really simple and amazing to use where it works (certain applications don't support it or actively block it).  If you're familiar with Intel's WiDi it's a very similar thing, especially with AirPlay mirroring.  Certain things work better with Airplay though (Slingplayer and Netflix, for example, display the controls on iOS while the video is on the TV) and others not so well (Hulu, for example, doesn't support video out - only mirroring.  HBOGo is blocked entirely, mirroring or video out).  It works really well and is very smooth with minimal lag with audio and experiences only occasional minor choppiness with video provided you're on 802.11N or have the apple tv wired (had bad problems with quality over two G routers).  The same, however, can't be said for AirPlay compatible games like Asphalt 6, which due to lag/stuttering is near unplayable (the jittering and stuttering mean you'll miss too much with fast paced games, e.g. In Asphalt you'll crash).Your enjoyment of this device will depend directly on the amount you give yourself to Apple, more specifically iTunes.  If you don't use iTunes for content purchase at least 1/3 of the functionality is right out the window.  And if you own a PS3, Xbox, TiVo, Wii, Roku, Google TV, certain Blu-Ray players, or even a smart TV then there's no point to the channels/apps really.  No MacOS or iOS devices and there's no point to the AirPlay aspect.  However if you're a diehard Apple fan and have lots of money spent in iTunes, this will be amazing, I'm sure of it.That's not to say it's not without its pleasure, the device is a joy to use.  I find myself wanting to listen to music from my TV just to look at the lush interface that's so simple and yet gorgeous.  But, for all of Apple's shine and improvements to the device, they've failed to address the largest issue - lack of content options.  Without more channels/apps like Netflix (looking at you Hulu, HBO, etc) Apple TV ultimately suffers from limited usability unless you're a big iTunes fan.  While it's fair that a good percentage of people looking at this device will have some content in iTunes, Apple simply cannot rely on that to support this product alone.  Features like AirPlay are a welcome addition but likely aren't enough.  Especially considering that video playback is a bit choppy and mirroring, especially with games, has too much lag.For me personally, I'm really only left with the AirPlay feature as a big feature.  Which alone might be worth the price, especially if Apple can improve the performance.  The content/channels/apps are, even objectively, poor.  And the dependency on iTunes either running or being used for content purchases diminishes the utility of the media for me leaving the \"Movies\", \"TV Shows\", and \"Music\" features as empty.  Yes it does everything the previous Apple TV did but better, but that's also it's flaw - it doesn't do anything new.Pros:++ Simple set up++ Very pretty and smooth interface++ AirPlay (for music and video)+ 1080PCons:-- Very limited channels/content-- iTunes only for content, even for in network- iTunes match dependent for music- AirPlay lags and stutters a bit too much with mirroring and gamesThings I'd like to see:1) Support for network storage for content streaming.  You can jailbreak and put plex or xmbc on to do this, but why do I have to?2) More channels/apps.  I've got all the missing channels on my iPad but why not on the Apple TV?  Especially annoying since this is based off iOS 5 and has hardware better or on par with the original iPad.3) Stronger AirPlay performance. (yes it's wired in, but it still stutters for games)In the end it does really well at what it does (most of the time) but it's a very shallow pool.COMPARISON TO ROKU 2:I also own a Roku 2 XS, so I figured I'd update with some remarks in comparison.  The Apple TV is notably easier to set up.  The Apple TV interface is also generally better, however certain apps (specifically looking at Netflix) while smoother on Apple TV are better laid out on Roku.  Specifically with that, I mean Apple TV forces a text list strong interface at front whereas Roku shows you the box art.  The remote on the Apple TV feels better but is more limited than Roku (Roku XS is RF as opposed to IR on Apple TV) and also lacks the instant replay (10 second) button found on the Roku XS - very handy at times.  Both are limited with text entry but have smartphone/tablet apps for use (although Apple Remote is only on iOS devices, whereas Roku Remote is on Android and iOS - a point to note, but not likely a deal breaker).  Image quality is comparable, Apple TV works better wirelessly than the Roku though (especially at start).  While Apple's interface is generally better/faster/smoother, it still ultimately lacks in content when compared to Roku.  Roku has Pandora, HBO Go, Hulu, Amazon Instant, Crackle, and many other options.  Aside from iTunes content (either from your computer or iTunes cloud for movies/tv or iTunes Match) there isn't anything I'm aware of that Apple TV has that Roku does not.  Apple TV does have AirPlay, which again makes it nice.While Apple TV interface is generally better and smoother, the cost of the Roku (I got the XS for $80, so 20% less) and the instant replay button make it a better option for streaming.  It's not as refined but it offers the heavy hitters missing from Apple TV.  Streaming options are just better with Roku.Unless you own an iOS device or will be upgrading to Mountain Lion (for AirPlay) or are heavily invested in iTunes store purchases - Roku is better hands down as Apple TV's use will be very very limited.  Conversely if you already own a gaming console or a TiVo or something similar then the streaming options of the Roku may not be unique (between my tivo, ps3, and 360 - there isn't a thing I use the roku for that I can't do on one of those - mainly the PS3).  If you're interested in a streaming device and don't already own a gaming console, Roku is likely better.  If you are only interested in Netflix, MLB, and NHL and/or you're really in love with iTunes or AirPlay, then Apple TV is better.Personally? I'm keeping the Apple TV, for AirPlay alone, hooked up to my TV in the living room.  The Roku is going in my guest room.  The Roku is a better device in my opinion, but it doesn't do anything unique like AirPlay.  Perfect on it's own though where I don't want to buy several devices again.  Apple TV though is much much limited on its own though.UPDATE:I've tried other AirPlay games (Real Racing 2, NFS Shift 2) and the performance is better on these games.  It's still not what I'd expect or really want to deal with but it's playable for sure.  Lag/stuttering happens less often and when it does it's less severe as compared to Asphalt 6.  I'll note as well that the performance doesn't have an appreciable difference when the Apple TV is wireless vs wired, so it's unclear what's contributing to the lag.  But the fact that some games are doable gives me hope for the future.UPDATE 2:Hulu was added - Huzzah!  We're getting closer and closer.I'd recently bought a MBA and have used the Apple TV for AirPlay when trying to show a video to someone.  It works well but occasionally refuses to work correctly - either the video is funny or there is no audio.  Requires a restart of the MBA to get working (so it's possible the error is on the MBA side).All in all I still enjoy and use this device but it's only used for AirPlay for me.  If you don't own other Apple products or don't intend to use AirPlay I still say your money is better spent on an Roku.  I'm still going to leave this as a 3 star review for me.  Again it's gained more features but not enough in my mind yet.  It's close to a 4 though, but the dependency on iTunes and other Apple devices to be anything unique keeps it down.  Feels more like it's supposed to be an accessory for Apple products, not a device to itself so much.  Which is fine, but then I'd expect better performance.UPDATE 3 (Final Update):So taking a look back on this after nearly two years of ownership.  Things have improved content wise - HBO Go is there, Disney and a few other channels have appeared as well.  But for all of content improvements they've still ignored the larger flaws while the improvements to competing devices (notably Roku and WD) and the introduction of the Chromecast manage to further highlight the flaws and shortcomings of the Apple TV.  There's still no NAS support and most services that could compete with Apple's iTunes (Pandora, Spotify, Rdio, Amazon Instant) are still missing and likely will be for the foreseeable future.The Apple TV interface, while simple, is becoming stale and ugly in a few applications (YouTube and Netflix jump to mind).  Roku has drastically improved their interface, bettering Apple as far as I'm concerned.  All the while the Chromecast has come on to the scene and for $35 does many comparable things (including whole screen casting similar to AirPlay from laptops - although admittedly not as smooth yet).Now, more than ever, the value proposition of Apple TV is largely tied to you and your participation in Apple's ecosystem.  If you need iTunes access or your need AirPlay, this is the only device to get them on.  But if you don't, there's really not any reason I can provide to buy an Apple TV anymore.  Even a year ago you could make the argument that if all you needed was Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube hat the Apple TV was as good option thanks to its attractive interface but since Roku has fixed their interface with the Roku 3 this simply isn't the case anymore; the Roku is now the box to beat.  The additional content channels provided by Apple TV do help its use, but it seems more apparent that they're deliberately leaving out competing services (or at least that those services have no interest being on Apple TV).  So if you use Pandora, Spotify, Amazon Instant, and several other services you have to get something else (for now at least).I'm not saying Apple TV is a terrible device, I still have mine hooked up in my living room for AirPlay.  But if you exclude iTunes and AirPlay there's simply no reason to buy it over a Roku or WD TV or Chromecast anymore really.  While iTunes and AirPlay are valuable features I could argue that the absence of Amazon Instant, Vudu, Spotify, Pandora, and Slingplayer are notable weaknesses that other platforms don't have. So in the end it really is based on your ecosystem needs.  If you're heavily invested into Apple's world and can do without the missing services then by all means get an Apple TV.  But in nearly any other instance your money is better spent elsewhere.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Another great Apple product", "Author": "rico567", "ReviewID": "RGWR52DSENCHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the title hints, our household is already well furnished with Apple products. And as it has been said in other reviews in this thread, it will be a much more positive user experience for people who have Mac computers, or iPad / iPhone / iTouch, for these last three can be used as remote controls with an excellent free app (\"Remote\") from Apple.If it were not for Apple's attention to detail, the installation of the Apple TV could be a bear for less technology-savvy consumers. But, even though I've installed a network or five before, in my mind this couldn't have been easier. Opened up the package, plugged stuff up, and things came right up on the screen. Used the included remote to log in. It should be noted that logging in (This means you have to have an Apple ID login and password) must be done on all devices you plan on involving in what is essentially a kind of network parallel to the wi-fi network you have in your house (although of course it runs on it).You must log in, and turn on Home Sharing, on the Apple TV, in iTunes on any computer you're planning on using, and also on any  iPad / iPhone / iTouch you're using as a controller. It should also perhaps be noted that these logins are separate from logins and passwords you may be using for Netflix, Hulu, or any other media you are accessing through Apple TV. This all takes some time, but it's a one-shot deal.The nicest surprise (which I had not come across in my research) about the Apple TV is that it includes a high fidelity TOSLINK optical audio out connection in addition to the HDMI connector. The Sony receiver on our home stereo is rather old-school in that it predates HDMI, so we weren't going to be able to run the Apple TV signal through that. Instead, I'd have to run the HDMI cable directly to our Samsung HDTV. However, the receiver does have TOSLINK inputs, so I just use a cable I had lying around, and I have excellent sound through our stereo speakers.Once everything was up and running, I was very gratified by the far better picture and sound that I was getting compared to streaming Netflix through the Wii (which we have done for several years heretofore). I already knew that the Wii's specs for picture and sound were pretty low, but for me, the increase in performance alone was worth the price of the Apple TV and cable.Apple's attention to the end user experience has always been one of the best features of owning their products, but the icing on the cake for Apple TV is the \"Remote\" app. Free, simple, and elegant. Once I used it, I knew I'd have to put the included remote in a safe place, because I wouldn't be using it again except in some extraordinary circumstances.There are some complaints in the reviews that the Apple TV lacks certain online media services. This may be the case, but for what it does provide, and for how it performs, we are very pleased.Addendum: This Apple TV is just the gift that keeps on giving. I was under some misapprehensions about the capabilities of AirPlay, specifically AirPlay Mirroring. Google it, go to the Apple support page, and then do enough links. Photos and music may be displayed from your iDevice simultaneously through the Apple TV to your HDTV. Great!", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Returned Roku 2 XS for the Apple TV", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2G49RRXTX8R7N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I first bought a Roku 2 XS from Costco then returned it for the Apple TV. The reason that I needed a device like this was to stream Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime for my wife and kids. We got rid of cable TV and decided to stick with over the air broadcast HD tv and internet streaming to save money. Here's why I decided to stick with the Apple TV.1. WiFi strength - My router is upstairs and my TV is downstairs.Roku 2 XS - it took about 4 or 5 attempts for the Roku to get setup under my wifi. First of all it could not see my 5ghz signal and for some reason it would go through the setup on my 2.4ghz signal, but end in an error. Finally, on the 4th or 5th attempt it went through.Apple TV - The setup was a breeze. It saw both my signals and the setup went through after the first attempt.2. Interface - I needed a VERY USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE. My wife is NOT tech savvy, but I consider myself above average when it comes to electronics.Roku 2 XS - The Roku's interface wasn't bad, but I didn't like how all of the channels were laid out in a single horizontal layout. You have to scroll sideways to view the channels. If you have a lot of channels installed, then it's a little troublesome to scroll to the end to go to the channel you want. You can list the channels in different order, but I like being able to view all the channels in a single screen. Once you click on a channel, the interface gets even worse for me. Netflix is a good example. The netflix interface is set up so that you see the suggestions for all of different genres of movies and shows on the main page. You have to scroll through a number of menus, which are hard to find, at first, to go to the recently viewed, instant queue, complete list of genres, search, and other sub menus. I wasn't as frustrated with it, but it took my wife so long to figure out some of the BASIC menus on the Roku box that she just ended up watching some shows on her 13\" laptop, instead. Happy wife, Happy life...Roku so far was not helping me.Apple TV - The channels are listed on one page with many more channels easily viewable at the same time on the TV screen. The interface just looked cleaner upon first glance. For some reason, it also seemed to scroll a lot smoother as I was scrolling through the channels. The Netflix channel was a LOT simpler to scroll through, as well. Once you click on the netflix channel, all of the different sub menus are listed on the right hand side of the interface. You can easily go to your instant queue, search screen, genre list, new arrivals, etc, without having to figure out where those menus are. My wife was able to find the kids shows, instantly. This made her happy.3. Channels - I was looking for a box for Netflix, Hulu, Movie purchases and rentals, and Amazon Prime.Roku 2 XS - Roku had all of them. I was pretty happy about that. The box that I bought from Costco also came with Angry Birds. That was a nice feature, although I only played it once and never had a desire to play it again. The Roku also had some other channels that the Apple TV does not have, like VUDU, Crackle, etc. I think the Roku is far superior to the Apple TV when it comes to the channel lineup. The main way to purchase/rent movies on the Roku is through Amazon. I like this because I actually like purchasing through Amazon rather than Apple. It seems like Amazon's prices are, generally, lower.Apple TV - Does not have Amazon Prime, and probably never will, but it does have Hulu and Netflix. I can't imagine that Apple would allow Amazon Prime to be a part of their Apple TV channel line up. Too bad. This was one of the things that really deterred me from buying it, initially. You can purchase/rent movies through Apple. I do believe Apple's prices tend to be higher, but I don't really purchase/rent movies for streaming, so it didn't matter to me that much.4. Streaming Quality - This was the real game changer for me.Roku 2 XS - I read that the quality of streaming on the Roku box was great. I'm sure the quality is great for those that have good wifi strenght or have the box connected via an Ethernet cable. I didn't have the luxury of having the box connected through a cable, because my router is too far for a physical connection. As soon as I started streaming a movie through netflix I was getting less than stellar quality. It also took about 20-30 seconds for every movie/show to get started. I figured it needed some buffering time. The movies were not coming through at HD quality and I was getting frustrated that I couldn't get the box to receive any movie at HD quality. Finally, I got one movie to start at HD quality, but in a few minutes it reverted back to a lower quality video. I'm sure this had to do with the wifi signal, but this was the main reason that I returned the box back to Costco.Apple TV - I thought that getting the Apple TV would not solve my issue with the bad wifi signal to the Roku box, so I was a little scared that I would have the same problem with the Apple TV. Once I started a movie on Netflix I saw a rotating, circular animation on the screen and I thought, \"GREAT, It's going to take forever to start.\" Wouldn't you know it, after about 5 seconds the movie started and it was perfect. The quality of the video was HD. I thought maybe it was because I was using my 5ghz signal, so I changed the wifi setting to my 2.4ghz signal and the video quality was perfect, again. I'm not sure why the Roku box didn't catch the wifi signal as well as the Apple TV, but I've not had problem, yet, with the Apple TV not being able catch a strong signal from my router.5. Playing local media through a computer/iPhone/iPad via box -Roku 2 XS - I can't really comment on this for the Roku box, because I didn't really try it. However, I do know that you can download software to your computer to stream movies from you computer to the Roku.Apple TV - I connected my iTunes to the Apple TV via homesharing, and voila it was done. The movie came out very nice. I did not consider Airplay as a reason to buy the Apple TV, but after I tried i fell in love with it. Airplay is NOT GOOD for watching movie through screen mirroring. The quality isn't that great, but it's not too bad watching it through homesharing via iTunes. I have all of my kids' DVD's ripped and in iTunes and it's a great way to view through the Apple TV on the TV screen. We also take a lot of pictures and video on our iPhones and we have been using Airplay to show the kids the videos that we take of them through the Apple TV. They love it and think it's great that they can view the videos on a big screen. There is one thing that took me a long time to figure out, though. When you try to view a video recorded through an iPhone via Airplay it will take FOREVER for the video to buffer. For 1 minute video it took about ten minutes to buffer. I figured out that you have to use \"Airplay Mirroring\" then view the video through the mirror mode and not through direct Airplay. I hope that makes sense. If you go through this route the video plays instantly without any buffering.Full Disclosure: I am what people might consider an Apple \"Fanboy\", BUT I first bought the Roku box, because I thought having more available channels and a cheaper price through Costco would be worth it. However, the Apple TV won out in the end because it was easier to use, the interface was better, and the quality of the videos were better through the way that I had it set up.If I had the ability to set up the box through a wired ethernet connection, then the results might have been different and I might have stuck with the Roku 2 XS. Despite a slightly higher price and not being able to access Amazon Prime, I'm happy with the Apple TV.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Better Match for iOS Users Than Fire TV", "Author": "Glenn R. Howes", "ReviewID": "R20JJVQI6E7580", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When Amazon released the Fire TV I rushed to buy one. I've plenty of Amazon hosted content and the prospect of a set top box which was both faster than my 3rd generation Apple TV and allowed for games made it seem like as great deal. So I did buy one, in fact, I bought two as I saw the opportunity for writing software for the big screen. But after a few weeks of novelty, my kids and I have reverted to using the Apple TV, although I will still switch over to the Fire TV now and then.The Fire TV is noticeably peppier given the newer processor in it. But this really only shows up in things that the Apple TV doesn't do, namely playing games. The more games I played on the Fire TV, the more I realize that Apple will have to release a 4th generation Apple TV with a dual core A7 and a beefier GPU  should they want to compete in the light set top gaming market. This current model is not going to be a competitive gaming platform. And that's OK.When it comes to what it does do, the current Apple TV is plenty fast at navigating, and displaying content. It shows 1080p high quality very well. Better, in my opinion than the Fire TV.  And the unified 2 dimensional grid interface used by the video apps on the Apple TV is more efficient than the haphazard interfaces seen on the Fire. The Netflix app on the Apple TV is noticeably more polished  and surprisingly given the hardware differences, much smoother scrolling than the utilitarian standard Android version distributed in the Fire TV App Store.  Since much of what we use a set top box for is watching Netflix, the more pleasant experience wins.As for controllers, the Fire TV remote is fine, and speaking into the voice recognition microphone, for that content it supports, is much nicer than arrowing around an on screen keyboard. But two things, it doesn't work everywhere not YouTube and not Netflix, and I don't use my Apple TV's remote. I pair a small Bluetooth keyboard, the kind found in iPad Mini typing cases, with my AppleTV and use it as my primary controller. Nicer than the remote, nicer than the iPhone remote App, nicer than the Fire TV and its fancy Bluetooth remote. It rocks when searching, jumping around lists and most importantly entering passwords.So, with a keyboard and a smoother Netflix integration, my family gravitates back to the Apple TV. But it is purchased content that keeps us there. We have a fairly large amount of movies bought from iTunes (maybe 100) and a huge number of TV shows and I don't care to have two places where I keep this content. Yes, this is the dreaded lock in but even if I were choosing a lock in today, I'd still choose iTunes for my content. One, every weekday there are free TV episodes to snag, and they are free longer, so I can bulk up on interesting new shows before choosing seasons to buy. There are a few free TV episodes on Amazon but there are only a handful at one time. Two, I have Apple devices and they are easily provisioned with movies or shows for trips or just watching from bed.  Three, I tend to think there is more HD content and the HD quality tends to be better. Having said that, it is a great feature of the Fire TV that it supports the Dolby Master Audio format, and not just Dolby Digital. I appreciate that Apple arranged its rights contracts such that I didn't have to pay to upgrade HD content from 720p to 1080p.We do switch over to Fire TV for Prime video content and dabbling with games.I hope Apple opens up the next Apple TV to 3rd party apps. That's a huge advantage of the Fire TV.I also have a Mac, and the integration of the Apple TV with OS X 10.9 has been quite flexible, and useful in a business setting or just as a way to share content amongst friends and family.Airplay support is one of the great advantages of Apple TV. I mainly use it to send music or podcasts to my home theatre speakers, but I have used it for sending Amazon Prime content to the big screen. I've even integrated Airplay support into my own apps I write, so I have one app that sends antenna signal quality to the TV and I had other drawing apps that show everyone what the user has drawn. It's a great feature, that I only wish more app developers took advantage of.People often ask why an iPad doesn't have an HDMI port. The AppleTV is the iPad's HDMI port, and a better than wired one that allows you to maintain mobility while still projecting to the big screen.Energy efficiency is first rate, at around a Watt during playback and practically nothing when asleep.I had to set the device to require a password for purchasing content from iTunes, and to enter my password via the Remote app on my iPhone, as otherwise, my naughty children would have purchased every episode of Fairly Oddparents.  Keep an eye out for discount iTunes gift cards occasionally found online.As for the differences between the 2nd generation and 3rd generation models, they are identical both in appearance and except for the 1080p capability in functions. While the newer model has a faster processor, in practice, the interface is zippy fast on either with any slowness due to network problems. If you don't have a 1080p TV, there is no reason not to stick with the 2nd generation, and even if you do, you might not notice a difference.  Both have gigabit Ethernet ports, and I recommend using a wired connection to your router if it is at all feasible.Apple is expanding the services offered on the device by partnering with the NBA, Major League Baseball, the NHL, and adding subscription model content like Japanese programming from Crunchyroll or TV shows via Hulu (although I'm not enamored with Hulus ads+subscription model; I'd rather pay to not see an ad. The PBS app is particularly nice and I don't have to record evening PBS shows anymore; there's a huge library of Nova and other programs right there. However, It's getting a little cluttered in there and I'm glad it's easy to disable apps.Other services have been useful. As I don't have access to ESPN, I've occasionally used the NBA app to watch game highlights. And my son has had an inordinate amount of enjoyment watching Minecraft run throughs on the YouTube app. I've even enjoyed the Flickr app displaying searches.So, in general, as an iOS user with a fair amount of purchased content, I've been happy with this device.

Surprisingly even more than the TV, to which it is attached, because we stream music directly to it as well, without turning on the TV. It' almost always on, either playing music, showing photos or playing TV shows and movies. We have decided a few years ago that we switch all our electronic devices to Apple products because they can work together so seamlessly. The Apple TV is something like the window to everything Apple; this is the ultimate presentation device. It has access to all our devices and can play or display pretty much all the content we ever purchased/downloaded/created, straight on the big screen.It's super easy to use and the interface is fast and responsive. We own a Samsung TV and a Samsung Blu-ray player, both of which actually have access to Netflix and other online services built-in, but boy ... you don't want to use them, believe me. They are laggy, ugly, have horrific user interface design, bad image quality and crash all the time. Since we don't have a cable box and we don't watch live TV, the TV is just a dumb box that displays the Apple TV's picture. The Blu-ray player is only used to play Blu-rays and DVDs occasionally.True, content on the Apple TV costs money: Netflix, iTunes, etc. However, if you are an adult with a job who otherwise spends over a $100 on cable TV, then the Apple TV suddenly becomes the potent alternative as an on-demand video box and gateway to all the content you already own.A couple of words about the changes between the old and the new Apple TV 2. The new one obviously has higher picture resolution (1080p) but even more importantly the rented and purchased iTunes (and Netflix) contents are also encoded in much better image quality. I wouldn't really notice the increased resolution, but the improved compression definitely makes it a worthy upgrade.Frankly, I don't agree with people who complain about the user interface changes. I think the new interface is easier to use, especially inside the Movies or TV Shows menu, where the submenus are readily available in the pop-up menu on the top of the screen.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy setup, nice alternative to expensive cable.", "Author": "Alan C.

The remote is a beautiful machined work of art. It fits nicely in the hand and the simple concept should be a lesson to any company that makes remotes.Setup: Could not be simpler.  Plugged it in to TV and within 5 minutes was logging in to Netflix and streaming video.  Most difficult part was remembering passwords to do one-time logins.Use:1. The UI is simple, elegant and easy to use.2. The video quality is excellent, it does not downgrade quality.  Streaming Netflix on my TV or through XBox always was frustrating in regards to video constantly coming in at different resolutions.  Used to blame it on my Internet connection until seeing the difference on Apple TV.3. iTunes integration is really nice and easy to set up.  No complicated directions to follow, Apple TV walks you through in an easy to follow manner.4. Never crashes.  The smart TV functions on my Samsung TV crashed or froze so frequently that I figured it was just part of using it... And it was, but not with Apple TV.  In almost a year of using it, it has not crashed or needed to be reset one single time.5. If you have an iPad, iPhone or Mac computer Airplay is great.  You can easily mirror the device onto your T.V. to show slideshows, presentations or anything you can think of.6. Can run slide shows from either Photostream or FlickerA couple of months ago my cable bill went through the roof after discounts expired.  Total bill was coming to over 200 dollars a month and best they could do was to reduce it to 120.  This was without any premium channels.  After doing a little math I concluded I could pay for Netflix and Hulu plus as well as buy the TV shows not available on either of those services on iTunes and still pay much less per month.Only drawback for me is no Amazon content available.  Maybe in the future...After two years of use and two years of having no cable I am more than happy with my choice of cutting cable and going this route. Over all the savings alone have more than paid for the Apple TV box. Since the time I wrote the review several apps have been added and content has increased to the point I just do not see going back to cable at all. Recently when I was presented with a chance to get video service with my internet for just $3 more I declined. What is the point of having a bulky cable box when I can watch the latest programs on Hulu plus when I want? In addition there is now even streaming news as well as a greater variety of services offered.Do yourself a favor and ditch cable video for either Apple TV or one of the competitors.

Duncan", "ReviewID": "RW3C4WSVPF0SF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just like other reviews have said, the full utility of the Apple TV (aTV) really depends on whether you have already bought into the Apple eco-system or plan to in the future. To determine if the aTV would fit my family's needs, I did my research, but I had to search mutiliple websites to answer my questions. This review is aimed at providing all the information I wanted to know before I pulled the trigger on this purchase.First, a word on my previous entertainment setup/usage. I had a Apple Mac Mini MC270LL/A Desktop used as a Home Theatre PC to a Samsung 1080p TV with an additional Sony BDP-BX38 Blu-ray Player Wi-Fi Ready / Internet Apps that was given to us. However, most of our movies were bought from iTunes and stored on an Iomega MiniMax FireWire 800/USB 2.0 1TB Desktop External Hard Drive 34937 (White). Add in a keyboard and mouse, and you can start to mentally see the clutter around our TV. We used this setup to primarily watch Netflix from the Safari browser and Hulu (free version) from Hulu Desktop - throw in a spot of Youtube on the side. As mentioned earlier, movies (and music) would be rented or purchased from iTunes. Even though the Blu-Ray player has Internet Apps such as Netflix, Hulu+, Pandora, Amazon video, etc; it wasn't used much at all, except for the odd DVD/Blu-Ray disc somebody loaned to us. However, when the Blu-Ray player was given to us, they forgot to remove their Hulu+ (paid version) account information, and we got introduced to the full glory of Hulu+ (it was nice to go watch past episodes for shows we discovered three seasons in). My wife and I both have an iPhone and iPad each, but we have no other laptops/desktops besides the Mac Mini.Footprint:Even though Apple's website has numerous pictures of the aTV, I was still very much surprised by how small this thing is. The official size is 3.9 inches wide by 3.9 inches deep by 0.9 inches high, and I even read multiple reviews that it was literally the size of a hockey puck, but I still stood amazed at how compact, sleek, and sexy this little black device was. The aTV replaced the Mac Mini, external hard drive, keyboard, and mouse. My wife could not be happier at the reduced \"nerd clutter\".Setup:Many reviews have talked about the ease in setup, so I won't belabor the point. Just know that like all things Apple, the aTV \"just works\" out of the box. Plug it in, type in your wifi, iTunes, and Netflix information and you're set to go.Remote:Apple always goes with a minimalist design, but I'm always concerned that anything \"minimalist\" will lack strength and functionality. I'm the type of guy that will use a 4x4 post to hang a bird feeder. However, this minimalist remote feels solid in my hand. My fingers wrap around perfectly, and the buttons have a solid response and feel. I can scroll through Netflix adding movies to my queue for hours without fatigue or risk of carpal tunnel. Additionally, the Apple Remote app works flawlessly and is really put together well. There may even be a lot of people who use the app as the primary remote, since it works so well. For me, there will be no more spending 30 minutes trying to find where the 2 year-old stole the remote off to, since my iPhone/iPad can seemlessly step in until the remote turns up 3 days later. Some people may also be pleased to know the old Apple - Apple Remote remote control can work as well, and for the more budget minded people, can be a cheap replacement/backup. I will say searching for content with the remote can be cumbersome. You have to move the remote cursor to each letter to spell out words. You can get pretty quick at it, but it is not the same as a regular keyboard. Unfortunately, the Apple Remote app for the iPhone/iPad won't allow you to use its keyboard to aide in the process. Unless you are willing to jailbreak (which currently there is no jailbreak for the aTV 3), you learn to be more efficient like searching for a TV show once, and additing it to your instant queue in Netflix or adding it to your favorites in iTunes. While a minor convienence, it doesn't effect my rating of the product.Navigation:Like most people, I'm looking for ease of use. I don't want to navigate through 10 submenus before finding information on a movie to press the back button 10 times to look at another movie. This was the downfall of the internet apps on my Blu-Ray player. The aTV home screen is setup with app icons like on the iPhone/iPad, making navigation between the apps simple. The implementation of the Netflix app is quite user friendly. I like it much better than using Netflix's website from the Mac Mini. The iTunes store is the same friendly user experience. You can quickly scan different movies, read a synopses, and move on. If you are looking at an Adam Sandler movie, you are one click away from seeing the other Sandler movies available on iTunes. The whole menu system is awesomely designed to quickly find a movie or TV show and start watching.Movies from the Cloud:I hated standing in front of the TV looking through DVDs only to find the DVD I wanted to watch wasn't in the case, and finding it 3 days later sitting next to the remote. With the mac mini, I stored all my movies on an external harddrive. While this added another piece of \"nerd clutter\", all my movies were readily accessable whenever I wanted. aTV takes this a step further: All your iTunes purchases are available through iCloud. Anything you have purchased via iTunes on a particular account can be streamed over the Internet to your aTV, so no need for a harddrive. In fact, I was quite surprised to find 3 movies that I had bought 6 years ago, that I had completely forgotten about. I bought them on a laptop that had crashed, and I assumed the movies were gone forever. However, iTunes kept up with that purchase, and it was quite the nice surprise when the aTV started streaming them for my lost enjoyment. These streamed movies take about as long as a Netflix movie to load and start playing (only a few seconds with my internet connection). Also, you can purchase additional movies and TV shows from the iTunes store directly from your aTV, and know they are safely stored in the cloud for your progeny to enjoy.iTunes Home Sharing:Also, if you have a laptop/desktop computer on your network with movies/music stored in your iTunes library, then you can stream these over your network to your aTV. This takes less time to start playing than if you are streaming from the cloud, but honestly, I find the cloud so convenient, that I don't use this option much except for playing music from one of our playlists. To me, the difference in load time is negligible. However, this is the only option to play music in your iTunes library, unless you have paid for iTunes Match which will allow you to stream iTunes purchases from the cloud. Also, if you have ripped any DVD's to your computer, then iTunes Home Sharing is your only option to stream to your aTV. But when needed, it works well.Content:The aTV certainly doesn't have the same amount of content as the Roku or even my Blu-Ray player. For internet content, the aTV is limited to Netflix, Youtube, Vimeo, Flickr, MLB.TV, NBA, NHL, and WSJ. Most of these speak for themselves, but I would like to expand upon MLB.TV. Now, I enjoy baseball, and Altanta Braves games is one thing I have missed since we got rid of cable 5 years ago when we got the Mac Mini. MLB.TV blacks out the Braves games since I'm so close to Atlanta, but I would probably be too cheap to pay the subscription price even if that wasn't the case. However, even without the subscription, MLB.TV will stream a 2-3 minute Sports Center-like recap of the games. I know it isn't the same, but it is more than I've had for 5 years, and I'm exstatic. The main gripe I've read about content is the lack of Amazon Instant Video on the aTV. I'm an Amazon Prime member, so I get the unlimited streaming videos. Even though the aTV lacks Amazon support (or even a iPhone/iPad app that I can mirror to the aTV), I'm not too upset. Amazon's library is not very large, and the movies they do have (that I would actually watch) are 99% of the time on Netflix too. If Amazon continues to develope their Instant Video library, then this may become more of an inconvience. This really comes down to whether you are an iTunes user or an Amazon instant video user. If the latter, and you have bought movies from Amazon Instant Video, then the Roku or similar device is for you. The other main gripe is lack of Hulu+, I'll address that below in the Hulu paragraph.AirPlay/Mirroring:If you have an iPhone and/or iPad, there is no excuse for not having an aTV. The Aiplay/Mirroring feature is amazing. I can display my iPhone/iPad screen up through my aTV onto my HDTV. You will be surprised just how useful this is. Say I was reading the news on my iPad and found a video of San Diego mucking up their 4th of July fireworks display, I can Airplay the video to the TV, and my wife and I can laugh in unison. When I go out of town for a business trip, my wife can mirror her Facetime video onto the aTV, so the kids can all see me on the \"big screen\" without having to squeeze themselves around the \"small screen\". Another useful feature, is if you prefer searching for videos on your iPhone/iPad, then you can open up Netflix (or similar apps that support Airplay) find the video you want to watch and Airplay it to the aTV. Now there is a difference between Aiplay and Mirroring. Airplay is used by apps that have been specifically designed to use the Airplay feature (many of Apple's apps do this) and fill up your TV screen. Mirroring will only put a mirroed video iPhone/iPad screen. This will only be in 4:3 aspect ratio, so you have these black bars on the left and right of the screen. But Mirroring is surprisingly responsive with hardly any noticeable lagging. I have found a mirad of uses for Airplay/Mirroring. You will not be disappointed.Hulu+:Mirroring can be combursome for watching lots of videos. This is one of the reasons why it took me so long to buy an aTV. With the gift of Hulu+ on the Blu-Ray player, I realized that this was a feature I wanted, but the aTV didn't have Hulu+ built in, and Mirroring would only play a 4:3 video of it, and not utilize my entire TV. So I waited. My patience was awarded on May 21, 2012, when Hulu released version 2.5 of their Hulu+ app for the iPhone and iPad. The update improved Airplay Mirroring to stream a 16:9 video to your aTV. It almost fills my entire TV, leaving only about a 1.5 inch black bar around the borders on my 55 inch TV. It was difficult to find information on whether this new implementation was good or not. I can certify that Hulu's update solved the problem, and Hulu+ mirrored from my iPhone/iPad to my aTV is a great solution. I enjoy sitting on my couch browsing my queue in Hulu+ then sending it to the aTV for the family to watch. The video is crisp and responsive. It is a pleasure to use. For those wondering, I do have my own Hulu+ account now, and am happy to pay the subscription fee.***UPDATE 2 Aug 2012***Apple pushed down a software update, and now Hulu+ is natively supported on the aTV. It has it's own appp icon right next to Netflix on the home screen. While I didnt mind aiplaying Hulu+ from my iPhone, the native app is more convenient. Initial impressions are Apple has done a good job. It is intuitive and easy to use. You can even sign up for Hulu+ directly from the aTV. If Hulu+ was a hang up for you on getting an aTV and my original review didn't sway you... Well now you have no excuses.Pure Speculation:Given the rumors of the iTV, I think Apple has more in store for the aTV. It is way too much for Apple to expect everyone to buy a whole new TV to get their new features/content. To overcome those user's who won't pay $2K for a new TV, I think all the new wiz-bang features will be offered in an aTV software update. If the rumors are right, that could be as soon as this year. And if I'm right, there will be a mad rush to buy aTV's, and I'll be glad not to have to fight lines at the Apple Store or waiting 2 weeks on backorders. Again, this is pure speculation, and this review will either be prophetic or be my shame.Summary:If you aren't an Apple-fanboy, the aTV still has a lot to offer. This is a must have item if you are already in the Apple eco-system, but is useful for those people only looking to cut their cable bill because of widespread internet content, and it is much cheaper than a HTPC. My advice mirrors other reviewer's. Know what you expect your purchase to do, and determine if a particular product meets your needs. The aTV does this for me in spades, but it additionally has the user friendly experience that Apple provides.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "The only source connect to my TV", "Author": "J.

"Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Owning both a Roku and AppleTV I would say both things do certain things well. One of the reasons that AppleTV only gets a four star rating and not a five star rating is because I feel that with Apple's resources they should be well ahead of Roku.Where AppleTV really shines is syncing with your home computer. Being able to listen to music stored on my computer in my living room, and being able to control it with my phone using the nifty remote app is where AppleTV shines. The Youtube integration is also a great feature on AppleTV. I love how Apple TV displays the album covers of the music I'm listening to on my television screen. Cover art has never looked better.Apple TV also allows you to mirror what's on your iPad or iPhone on to your TV screen. This is great for photos but when using it with things like Slingplayer it was horrible. My slingplayer app got no picture and other apps such as HBO GO are completely blocked. I mirrored some of my music on my iPad and noticed a huge drop in quality from the music that was played from home sharing. Not sure why.Both of these devices offer netflix however the Roku also adds many more channels such as Amazon On Demand, which I would argue is far better than the movies app on Apple TV.  Roku also offers HBO Go, Hulu Plus, Pandora, Crackle which are not offered on Apple TV, however Apple TV has YouTube which Roku doesn't. There is a channel that you can download for Roku called RateRix that allows you to watch all your bookmarked youtube videos however this channel is such a pain to use that it isn't even worth the free download.There's another app called Plex that I have on my Roku which isn't the easiest app in the world to use however it supports a lot more video than Apple TV does and one of my videos that was an MKV file played fine in iTunes but on AppleTV it didn't have any sound whereas with Plex the sound worked perfectly and was in sync with the video.  Plex also allows you to access your iTunes library on your Roku, however the user experience isn't quite up to par as it is with AppleTV.If you don't want to download the plex channel on your Roku, the Roku offers a USB port which allows me to download movies to a Flash drive and simply insert them into my Roku. This is not offered on AppleTVI would say both of these have features the other lacks, however where Apple dropped the ball in my opinion is not having an App store like they do with the iPhone, iPod, and iPad.  Roku shouldn't even be in business, much less providing competition for Apple.If I had to pick I would go with the Roku, however the AppleTV does some very cool things that Roku doesn't such as YouTube and while both will allow you to access your entire music library, the AppleTV does a significantly better job at this than Roku. On the other hand Roku has a lot more apps, and I would argue better apps.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "FINALLY - like they say, ''it just works''", "Author": "Matt M.

Want to watch a downloaded movie on AppleTV? Drag it into iTunes. Thats it. Drag it. I don't know how well ROKU plays your own video library as mine worked about as well as a 5th grade science project and I hurled it out the window in rage. (not really)BAD!How tiny is this remote? I know its the future and all, plus Apple always assess you a premium for design simplicity, but I even have skinny little ET fingers and hit the input key instead of the arrow key. Plus, the super simple remote can make things a little tricky (sometimes the left arrow takes you back, sometimes the menu button - or to turn on CC in Netflix, you hold the input button 5 seconds) Also, the box and remote are so tiny, you have to make sure they are well within each others line of sight. No pointing the remote up in the air as you browse.CONCLUSION!I had a ROKU - hated it. I had an XBOX, had a WII, tried plenty of streaming options.

Well if you have a Roku and no iTunes then go buy a Roku, if you have an iTunes account well you better stick around. Oh and how about that Chromecast dongle that only works half the time and destroyed their only reason to being relevant? So yes, this ATV3 is not jailbreak compatible but that's okay. Most consumers don't understand that anyways. So here are the reasons why you should buy it.1) iTunes Library2) Airplay3) Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu+Do you have your iTunes library full of movies and music or what not? Try using Home Sharing and boom your entire library is on your AppleTV (given your computer is on). I love this because I have over 100 HD .mp4 movies on my 2TB hard drive connected to my mac which is in my bedroom while I have Apple TV's in my bedroom as well as my living room (projector). So now I have the greatest inexpensive home theater setup.What in the world is Airplay?So whenever someone comes over my apartment and they have an iDevice I like to mess with them and borrow their phone. Then I ask oh what's your favorite song? They tell me then I Airplay it to my setup. Most people are pretty impressed by it or shocked by it. This technology has been around for a few years and way cheaper than your Sonos or your Bose system.Netflix, Hulu+, HBO GoThe basics. You buy these for the cool apps, yes Apple doesn't have the best apps but they work very well.Other apps that you should buy when you purchase this.Beamer - Airplay your movies of any format to your ATVMovieIcon - Have movies but don't have the pretty cover art? This will do it for you (Requires MAC)AirFoil - You can use your computer, iOS device, Android device, etc to airplay to all these other things.So don't think twice, buy now.Anymore questions ask me!", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most used device in my house", "Author": "Brian Carilli", "ReviewID": "R3SLBQRFXTR1Z5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own 2 of these bad boys, one for home, and one I carry around in my IT backpack. I absolutely love this tiny device, please keep in mind, it is not for everyone. I personally have an Apple Eco-system at home, so it makes sense to use this in my case. The device is great if you use streaming services such as Netflix or Hulu. The user interface on the ATV is dead simple to use and the configuration is super easy, you will be up and running in under 5 minutes. You can also run YouTube and stream radio stations from around the world, and with the latest update, can run HBOGo. The one drawback of this device, is the streaming of personal media. It will only stream video from your iTunes library, as long as the ATV and your iTunes library are on the same network. iTunes videos are in m4v, or mp4 format only. If your videos are saved in any other format, they will not be playable on the ATV, unless you run them through a video converter. I worked mainly with .avi and wmv files, before  I got this device, I had to re-encode my whole video library to mp4 format. While it was time consuming to do this, (over 100+ videos), It was well worth it, as the file sizes for my HD-WMV files, shrunk from 8GB down to 2.5GB with no loss in quality. There are a lot of applications out there that can do this conversion. (For a free method, I'd suggest Handbrake, as it's super easy to use, and is available on MAC, PC and Linux) Another nice feature of the ATV is iTunes Match. If you currently subscribe to this service, $24\\year through iTunes, all the music in your iTunes library will be available on the ATV without needing to have your PC on. Another plus, comes if you run an Apple computer, or have an iPhone. The ATV has the ability to \"mirror\" those devices. I have an 11\" Macbook Air, but I can wirelessly sync it directly to my TV, using the ATV. So instead of an 11\" screen, I have a 47\" monitor. Same goes for the iPhone, your TV will now be the screen, which is great for playing games. I highly recommend this device to anyone who uses Apple products, you won't be disappointed. If your a PC user, you can still use it, but using something with a bit more support for different formats, like a Roku might be better suited for you.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Replaced my DirecTV service", "Author": "Jared Robinson \"J.W.

I decided it was just not worth spending close to $100 a month for the few things I watched.

The streaming works wonderfully, even with the TV in my house that is a ways from the WiFi source.  You can also stream mostly anything from your iPhone or iPad to the Apple TV device through AirPlay.

I read most of the reviews beforehand, and I was aware about all the shortcomings of ATV. My original thought was, even if I didn't like it, I can always jailbreak and install third party software on it.Connectivity and Netflix:It did not have any surprises, and the whole installation finished in 10-15 minutes--including wireless setup. I have a long WPA2 password, and that alone took an extra 5 minutes.  It connects to both 2 GHz and 5GHz channels on my Linksys E-4200 router without any problem. I immediately tested Netflix, and I was blown away by the interface, 1080P quality, and streaming speed of 8-12Mbps. I have a Sony BDP-S580 Blu-ray player that I used for streaming from Netflix, but Apple TV simply puts it into shame both in ease of use and speed. For this reason alone, I will keep this Apple TV. They really have thought about the user interface.I could not use the Apple TV to stream from my Synology DS212 NAS. It simply doesn't see the NAS. Synology has a music app that you can use to stream your music on Apple TV, but it doesn't support iTunes Home Sharing. I still could not find a decent way to stream movies from the Synology.Dual Screen (AirPlay) and Photo Stream:The dual screen or AirPlay is not too impressive for me. I like the share feature that you can send any YouTube or other videos to Apple TV, but the dual display is not that useful. Simply because the new iPad has an amazing Retina display that no LCD can come close to it. In addition, the dual display mode only works in 4/3 aspect ratio and not 16/9. Photo Stream works very well between Apple TV, iPhone 4s and the new iPad. I really enjoy this feature, and it uses your own photos as the screen saver.Problems: Only One!I have noticed that this new Apple TV does not support HDMI Control or CEC! I researched and found out that it has been a common problem in all Apple TV generations. Apparently, Apple doesn't like to support this mandatory standard.Conclusion:Considering the price, I will keep this new Apple TV. It is the best device for Netflix, and does a few more extra things. It is reassuring that you can always jailbreak and install third party software on it. At the moment, it doesn't do much with my current home network setup, but I am a satisfied customer. Thank you for reading this mini review.UPDATE (August 2013):It has been about 18 months since I got this ATV 3, and now even my TV has Netflix app. I rarely use this ATV, and since there is no jailbreak for version 3 so it can play XviD or DivX files, I wonder if Apple can keep up with the competition in the long run.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love Apple TV", "Author": "M.

Shepard", "ReviewID": "R9YH5X3SCG1L9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's simple out of the box but be aware you will need to purchase HDMI and ethernet cables on your own.  This comes with power cord only.  Truly a plug and play device. One of the simplest, trouble free electronic devices I've ever utilized.  Plug in power. Plug in ethernet or connect wireless.  Run HDMI to TV or reciever. That's it.  The device will power itself up and walk you through a quick set up screen. It will be easier if you have created an iTunes account already. Updates will download w/in the first several minutes hooking it up.I won't go into a lot of detail about the icons/apps as they are well explained here and other places.  The UI is user friendly and easy to navigate using the small, sleek remote control.  The only one I've really played with so far is Netflix which connected to my account using just user name and pw. Didn't have to run up to the home computer and register the device to my NF account. Very easy. Unless you subscribe to iTunes Match ($25/yr.) you must have the iTunes program open on your device before it will stream iTunes content through your TV. If you pay for Match then you can pull all that out of the cloud and won't need to have your imac, iphone or ipad running.Probably the favorite feature everyone wants to hear about, and the reason I purchased the box to begin with is Air Play Mirroring.  You must be running Mountain Lion on your mac or have ios6 (I think) on your phone or pad.  Additionally your Mac needs to be a relatively recent build; mid 2011 and up I believe running the i5 Intel chip. Your device will automatically detect an apple tv box on the network and produce an icon for you to click.  This occurs in two places:  there is an icon on the bottom of the iTunes program which if clicked will push video and audio from w/in iTunes to your TV.  The other one is located in your main tool bar somewhere (on my imac this is the top right corner of screen). Activating that will push web mirroring to your TV.  I did a quick Google search to figure out which settings are best. Under resolution select \"Best for Airplay\" and deselect \"Overscan Correction\".  Initially I had some issues with the whole herky, jerky, stop-motion effect. Again a Google search for \"Mirroring Stuttering\" or \"Mirroring Freezing\" will take you to many solution pages.  There are many psbl. fixes but these seem to be the most common and worked for me:  make sure you have a true N band, dual antannae router with most up to date firmware. Use the 5Ghz band. In your router advanced settings deselect \"WMM Enabled\" under the QoS-Quality of Service-tab. Have the router as close to the apple box as you can. Turn off other apps and limit other usage on your network. Obviously high speed internet is necessary. Once I adjusted for all that the picture came in quite clear--not quite HD or bluray but definitely as good as or better than SD signals. Every now and then a few screen pixelations and minor stuttering will occur but nowhere near the extent as before the tweaks. Also volume had to be turned up quite high on my receiver before audio sounded good. The play/pause button on the remote will not stop and start video so if you need a break you'll have to control that from the device that's being mirrored.  Ultimately this is really a fantastic bit of technology though future updates will hopefully make it even better. There's all kinds of free streaming services from TV to movies to clips etc. that can now be viewed from the comfort of a couch on your big screen. This is why I bought the box and it has delivered satisfactorily.Biggest downside I have to comment on has nothing to do w/ Apple or the box. I chose Amazon free shipping and they took their sweet time getting it to me. I always use the free shipping when offered and usually still have the product w/in a week or so.  They didn't even ship this box the first week. Then once shipped it took another week getting to me. Pretty ridiculous but free so little room to complain I guess. Still annoying.  If you have high speed internet and a mirroring capable device I don't see how you can go wrong getting the Apple TV box for less than 100 bucks. Well worth it.EDIT:  Figured out the volume issue during mirroring.  Need to make sure the volume on your mac, phone or tablet is all the way up which I thought mine was. Turns out it was turned way down and once adjusted sound through the receiver speakers was just fine.EDIT #2:  12/8/2012.  With the iTunes 11 update the AirPlay mirroring icon in that program is now at the top of the window on the left side near the Song Title bar.  Also just had difficulty with an update last week.  Google search indicated many others having similar troubles trying to get the update via ethernet.  The fix is to disconnect ethernet and get the update wirelessly...then reconnect ethernet cable when completed.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful to use with ipad.", "Author": "Jane W.

And if you have prime, you want access to Instant Video.And, since these boxes are all about easy access to content, the lack of these hugely popular content providers is a really big issue for me. Plus, the benefits of the AppleTV over the Roku (airplay, access to your iTunes library) aren't that important to me. If they are to you, then your decision may be tougher.I say go with the Roku.**UPDATE**I have subtracted another star because I am encountering a very serious problem with my AppleTV now: whenever I try to buy a movie from iTunes, it takes HOURS (literally) of buffering before I can start watching.I have searched online and many people have this same issue, and nobody seems to have a solution. One website suggested switching to SD video quality, but even that hasn't helped. Why can I stream movies from Netflix or Amazon immediately, but it takes hours for an iTunes movie to buffer? It makes no sense. This obviously is yet another reason to buy a Roku instead. (In fact, last time I tried to rent from iTunes, it said it was going to take 1.5 hours before I could watch. I went downstairs and tried to rent from Amazon on the Roku LT, and I was watching it in less than 5 minutes.) Dumb.

Also the way to \"mirror\" what you see on your ipad is supported by enabling the Home Sharing section under the Computer icon on apple tv.  Also, in order to see your control for Airplay on your ipad place your finger on the bottom of your screen and swipe up fast and it'll bring up your Airplay control panel so you can start mirroring things from the device to the TV.

Trejo", "ReviewID": "R14859AOVD7J3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my first Apple TV a year ago.  Pretty much DOA out of the box.  It kept dropping the connection to iTunes.  It was impressed Tech support (US based, I think even in CA) answered the phone late Saturday afternoon, really knew his stuff, and was able to walk me through alot of different trouble shooting.  I learned many of the internet providers have a firewall system that interferes with the AppleTV, so the first thing we did was call AT&T; and reconfigure firewall setting.  BUST.  The second thing we did was try to update the hardware.  Since we couldn't connect long enough to complete the update, I had to go purchase a mini-USB cable (not included) to do a wired connection and update through iTunes.  BUST.  Keep in mind this took several weeks of troubleshooting and testing and retesting.  I was ready to throw in the towel.Tech finally suggested I had a bad unit and made an appointment for me the next day to go to the Apple store and swap it out.  The unit I received was new and had been tested by Apple and all the updates had already been installed for me.  Took it home and worked flawlessly just like I had expected it to when I first opened it several weeks prior.I will say I was very impressed with Apple's extensive service for a cheap $99 product.Over the year, my family has migrated more and more to the AppleTV and use it quite a bit.  My kids both asked for Apple TV's for Christmas, and I was able to ditch three U-Verse boxes.  With free HiDef broadcast TV, and all the options available on AppleTV, my kids are very happy.  The second and third Apple TV's I purchased worked flawlessly out of the box, have been running for over a month with moderate to heavy use and no issues.  They all connect to one iTunes account, which made setting all the parental controls super easy.My understanding is you can connect up to 8 AppleTV's to one iTunes account in one house.  I have found streaming movies lags when streaming three different AppleTV's at once, and I have 18mbps internet service.  We don't usually stream three movies at once, but I was curious to test the performance..I primarily purchased the AppleTV to manage the 2500+ mp4 movies I've collected and swapped with friends over the years.  I must admit I was not prepared for all of the extra features the AppleTV offers.The remote is not to my taste.  It's way too small and gets lost way to easily, especially with kids (- 1 star).  But any iPhone or iPad can control any AppleTV, and I can control any AppleTV from pretty much anywhere in the house, including sending live video to my kids TV's via Airplay.  (+1 star)the AppleTV remote must have a direct line of sight to the AppleTV to work.  You cannot tape it to the back of the TV and expect it to work.  It MIGHT if you have reflective walls, but you should have that expectation.  It is small, and some double sided tape worked real well mounting it to the top or bottom of some wall mounted flat screens.You can change the settings and remove icons/apps from the home screen that you don't want on there (customizable).You can set up parental controls and passwords to restrict content, compatible with MPAA ratings and US TV ratings.There is no Pandora app (yet), but we simply run Pandora from an iPhone or iPad and Airplay it to the AppleTV.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple TV 3rd Gen is very good but has greater value & additional features for Mac users", "Author": "M.

For most people, the 3rd generation is the way to go. It offers improved performance in several key areas over the 2nd generation Apple TV. But if you want to jailbreak the AppleTV, you can't with the 3rd Gen so you'd want to find the 2nd Generation.From an appearance standpoint the two generations look identical. It's what is inside that makes the big difference.Here are the notable improvements in the 3rd Gen Apple TV. \u27ba it supports 1080p/720p, whereas the 2nd Gen only supports 720p \u27ba it has a faster on-board chip, the A5 vs the A4 chip in the 2nd Gen. \u27ba it supports 5GHz networking whereas the 2nd Gen only supports 2.4GHzThe faster A5 chip really makes a noticeable difference in navigating the interface. And of course since the Apple TV now supports 1080p and has 5GHz networking, the A5 chip helps enable that higher spec performance.The back of the Apple TV has, from left to right: \u27ba AC plug \u27ba HDMI port \u27ba MicroUSB port \u27ba Optical Digital output which supports Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound \u27ba 10/100 Base-T EthernetIncluded in the box is an AC power cord and an Apple Remote (IR.) Concerning the remote, since it is infrared, the AppleTV has to be able to \"see\" the remote or you have to bounce it off walls or ceiling to control the AppleTV. The best alternative is to use the app and control the AppleTV from your iPhone.The available content on the Apple TV has been greatly expanded with this newer generation. Here are the highlights of great content available: \u27ba Netflix - \u27ba Hulu Plus - paid content \u27ba HBO Go - access to HBO programs if you subscribe to HBO already \u27ba PBS \u27ba ESPN \u27ba ABC - doesn't yet work with Time Warner Cable \u27ba NBA - premium but some free content \u27ba NHL - premium but some free content \u27ba Crackle - movies and tv shows similar to Netflix \u27ba Bloomberg \u27ba skyNEWS \u27ba Trailers \u27ba Weather \u27ba KORTV - Korean station that offers video on demand - free and premium content \u27ba Disney Channel - doesn't yet work with Time Warner Cable \u27ba Disney XD - doesn't yet work with Time Warner Cable \u27ba Disney Junior - doesn't yet work with Time Warner Cable \u27ba Smithsonian \u27ba Yahoo Screen \u27ba iCloud Photos \u27ba iMovie Theater - iMovie projects that you share to the theater \u27ba Podcasts - \u27ba YouTube - video sharing \u27ba Flickr - photo sharing \u27ba Vevo - music videos \u27ba Vimeo - video sharing \u27ba MLB.TV - Major League Baseball - some free content but a premium subscription is $24.99/yr \u27ba Qello -  HD concert films and music documentaries - $4.99/mo \u27ba Crunchyroll - anime on demand \u27ba MLS - Major League Soccer \u27ba Radio \u27ba WSJ Live - programming from Wall Street JournalThat's quite a line-up and I'm certain Apple will be adding more content as time goes by. Keep in mind that some of the content is paid content but much is free and most content will require you to set up an account whether the content is free or paid.In addition to all that streaming content the Apple TV also provides some additional benefits to people in the Apple ecosystem. It has AirPlay and consequently it is now possible to stream to your HDTV your MacBook Desktop, iPad or iPhone. It can essentially mirror whatever is on  your device and stream that to your HDTV. This is fantastic for presentations, sharing slideshows, tutoring people and so much more.But even more interesting is the fact that you can now extend your desktop of your Mac computer to your HDTV. It's as if you now have two monitors hooked up to your computer. Once you start enjoying that feature I'll bet you'll be hooked.I love my Apple TV. The faster processor just makes the thing faster and it's been rock solid in performance too. Setup is a breeze. I also have a ROKU but since getting the 3rd Gen Apple TV, I rarely use the ROKU... there is no need to really.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "The latest upgrade assuaged my doubts.", "Author": "R.

Now, everything under that icon is free! This is what I was expecting in the first place; I just didn't wait long enough, it seems. Although the resolution is not HD, it's OK. I still don't know how much of a lag there will be between actual broadcast and ATV availability (Downton Abbey, e.g.) but my impression of ATV has gone from one star to 4.

I opted for Apple TV instead of subscribing to something like Hulu Plus. There are, of course, pros and cons to both options. For me it boiled down to not wanting another monthly subscription so I am sacrificing on some content.Regarding my experience with Apple TV thus far...installation was extremely simple! I was up and running within 10 minutes. The first thing I did was bring up one of my major network apps on my iPad (abc/cbs/nbc) and using Airplay and the mirroring technology stream an episode of one of my favorite shows. Worked like a charm! (I did have to Google the steps on this because it wasn't listed in the manual how to set up Airplay, but it was very simple).  This was one of my main reasons for buying Apple TV, so I could stop watching my current seasons of shows on small screens like my iPad and iPhone (or computer). The picture was crystal clear and once it had a solid connection, it played flawlessly (a few hiccups at the start).After that, I brought up Netflix. This was just an added bonus for me that Netflix streaming was included, I already had this capability through my Samsung BluRay player and my Wii. But let me tell you, the Netflix experience using the Apple TV is stellar compared to the Wii and BluRay player! It connects extremely quickly, much quicker than my BluRay player and the look and feel is just outstanding.There are a lot of apps already available with Apple TV but be forewarned, you need a programming subscription with a major provider for a lot of the content. I knew this going in, so this didn't disappoint me. But there is still a lot that you can leverage: PBS, The Weather Channel, Radio, YouTube and more. Let alone anything in your iTunes.The one con is that iTunes rentals and purchases for movies, TV shows/series, etc. is pretty inflated, at least for my area of the country. Between RedBox, Netflix and brick & mortar rental stores, you can rent shows for much less than iTunes offers. The convenience is nice however, if that is worth the inflation to you.Some features I recently learned about but have not used yet: there is a special connection with Yahoo that you can use. I want to explore this more. You can also use your iDevice as a remote by downloading the Apple TV Remote app. I downloaded the app but haven't used this yet. The remote it comes with is nice and simple, but very small so downloading the app is a good back-up plan in the event the remote gets lost (I have a 4 & 5 year old!).I'm looking forward to the updates that Apple makes to Apple TV because as awesome as it is now, I know it is only going to get better. And for $99, your ROI will be quick if your eliminating a cable/satellite subscription like me.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cut the Cord!", "Author": "ramir san diego", "ReviewID": "R25SOADRQFTNCI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With the price of cable/ satellite service....I was debating/ researching which streaming option to use.  Looks like Blueray option was out due to too many complaints about connectivity..it was down to Appletv 3 or Roku 3.  I guess either would do..but I read a review somewhere stating the ApleTV had a more stable Wifi connectivity and thats what I needed.  My router was on the 2nd floor of the house and really needed wifi stability.Set-up was easy enough. Just turn on the unit/ plug it in and follow onscreen instructions.  Took a little while for the initial boot-up/ set-up.  Typing the password for the wifi set-up was a little challenging since I was not used todoing it via the remote (probably needs a keyboard accessory in the future)...and the typed character was converted to * after a few secs...so you really need to know your password.  It will rememebr the set-up after everything is set-up so you do this only once.  Just Be careful with the very small remote...very large chance to misplace it , specially with small kids using it.Comes with a lot of links (mostly need account with itunes) to purchase stuff...access to Youtube , podcasts, Smithsonian  and weather channel were free.Really need either a HULUplus or Netfilx subscription depending on what you regularly watch.  Beats paying $70++/ month for DirecTV which has 90% of the channels you dont watch....and clouds don't interfere with the signal.**NOTE: make sure the router is on first before you turn on the Appltv or else it will take a long time to do a re-set-up/ re-link to the router.***SO far it has been great, after a month of no huge cable/ satellite", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect if You Are Already Invested in the Apple iOS Ecosystem", "Author": "John Keitz", "ReviewID": "RMF8DV5WZ02Z4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a SmartTV, so adding Apple TV was a bit superfluous. Nevertheless, there are several features that made the purchase worthwhile for me.  To begin with, the whole family has a wide range of Apple devices, from iPod to iPhone to iPad, and the main feature I was interested in was Airplay.  Using Airplay, you can take whatever is on your screen and mirror it to the TV (this only works with the iPhone4S and later items, so the iPhone 4 and the iPod were left out).  You can also send the sound from your iOS device to your TV and from there to the surround sound system using Airplay.  Some games are designed for Airplay use as well.  Sky Gamblers is a good example of this.  You see the main view on the TV, and you have the secondary view, in this case your radar, on your phone.  There is a bit of lag from time to time, but you can get used to it.  Likewise, you can use Airplay to show photos and videos from your iOS device.  Unfortunately, in order to prevent \u201cbuffering\u201d issues while playing back, Apple TV buffers much of the video beforehand, which means a long wait from when you press play to when you see video playing.Apple TV offers many other features, but I find that I rarely use them.  It is connected into iTunes, so your iTunes content is available to you, but other than that, I find most of the features are already present on my SmartTV.  For example, while Apple TV has Netflix, and a very nice interface at that, my TV has a Netflix button that has me in Netflix very quickly.  Other things like NHL Game Center are also available, but again, easier on my SmartTV.Apple TV is missing some things that you may expect from a SmartTV add-in box (like Roku).  There is no Pandora, Slacker, etc.  On the other hand, it can play anything from your iPhone, so you can just fire up Slacker from there instead.  Also, the remote is terrible.  Tiny, oversensitive, just not very good.  Fortunately, you can download the Remote app from the App Store (free) and control your Apple TV from your iOS device instead.  Another drawback, all it includes is the power cable.  You will need your own HDMI cable to attach it to your TV and you will need your own TOSLINK cable to connect it to your stereo (unless you use HDMI for that too).  Bad move on Apple\u2019s part, since it won\u2019t just work out of the box.  HDMI cables are cheap, and it would have been a good idea to include one, just to have people not have to go out to get one after they open the box and discover there isn\u2019t one.Bottom line, Apple TV is great if you are already into the Apple Ecosystem.  If you have iPhones, pods, and pads, this is the gadget for you.  If you already have a SmartTV, then you already have most of the features here.  If you don\u2019t have a SmartTV and are looking for an add-in to give you those functions, you may do better with a Roku or the like, but you won\u2019t have the Apple functionality (Airplay and iTunes).", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product", "Author": "Paul L.

If you're content buying things from the iTunes store and streaming videos from its short list of approved partners, you will probably adore this device. I was really disappointed. And I will tell you why.The problem is that if you'd like to do ANYTHING else, no matter how standard it might be on similar devices, you are out of luck.Want to watch that Blu-Ray you ripped into Xvid/avi? Nope. An .mkv file... half the tvs and Blu-Ray players out today can do that. Not your ATV. It only plays H264 stuff ripped into its formats. How about that camera phone video you made of your kid? Hardly. Maybe you made that video in one of the short list of approved formats. I hope you have it on a Mac or a PC running bloated old iTunes, because your shared network folders mean nothing to ATV. What if I just put it on a thumb drive and plug it in? Sorry, no USB ports. So if you're on Linux or you just don't like iTunes, you're S.O.L. I'm told there are elaborate ways to convert files and funnel them over from iTunes, but when competing devices offer plug n' play, how is that not an annoying hassle?How about streaming stuff... Maybe you'll just watch Hulu. Nope. (EDIT: Hulu has been added.) Amazon Instant Video? Nope. Blockbuster On Demand? Nope. Maybe listen to Pandora? Nope. Spotify? Don't kid yourself. Even my phone can play stuff off a UPnP server. Can't Apple TV? Nope again. No device has every service, every file format, but the ATV only has the ones that don't interfere with their moneymaking efforts. You could try and jailbreak it to get it to be more flexible... but there isn't a working jailbreak for Apple TV 3.If you browse through other compact media players, you're going to find that things like mkv/xvid support, USB ports, Hulu, and Pandora aren't just available, they're increasingly standard. Half the Blu-Ray players coming out today can do much of this stuff, many of the tvs, too.But even though the iPhone offers similar functionality to competing phones, the iPad offers similar features to other tablets, and Apple laptops serve similar needs to PC laptops, the Apple TV isn't really analogous to other home media players at all. It lacks most of the functionality those devices have in common and exists primarily as an aesthetically pleasing way of expanding your existing relationship with Apple and its partners onto your television set. If this is all you need/want, consider this a four star review. But for me, looking for an all purpose media player, I felt really let down.If you want your media player to play YOUR media, your way or if you're interested in services that have any competing interest to the iTunes store, best look elsewhere. It's not that this is a bad device, it's just that it's not really a true peer to similar devices.As a post-script, please let me add that I'm not antagonistic to Apple products AT ALL. I have an iPad I adore. I also have a Windows desktop, an Android phone, and a Linux laptop. I'm just looking for the best stuff. I'm not pushing any OS-specific agenda.

I use both, Apple and Android so I don't like one over the other. Now for the main review on the Apple TV...I will separate this review into sections for your convenience...==== Air Play ====Personally, this was the main reason why I bought the Apple TV. I own two iPod Touches and an iPad and I use the Air Play on the Apple TV a lot. I can easily steam over to the Apple TV without any problems and it is really easy to do. I end up mirroring Youtube videos onto my TV Instead of watching them on the small screen. This is probably one of the best things about the Apple TV. If you don't have other Apple Devices and are just looking for a media box to stream netflix, huluplus, etc on your TV I would recommend buying a different product instead as they tend to have more features to them then the Apple TV.==== 1080P Content ====When renting or buying movies in the iTunes Store you can watch everything in 1080P! That is Full HD! You can also watch previously owned movies on your Apple TV so you don't buy them over again you just start enjoying on your TV Instead of an iPod/iPhone/iPad screen.==== Content/Channels ====The main downside to an Apple TV is the amount of content/channels it supports. It doesn't have as many channels as other media players like the Sony SMP-N200. If you want something cheaper, but with more channels and don't plan on using AirPlay then I would go with other options; however, if you do own other Apple Devices that are capable of AirPlay then this is a Great Buy! You can now have everything that is shown on your iDevice's screen on the screen of your TV! That is what makes the Apple TV such a popular product.Overall This is a great product that I really enjoy using and it adds to a great addition to my other Apple devices.

But, my brother told me one day how much he uses his, so I decided to give it a try.  I have an iPhone 4s, iPad 2 and an iPod Touch 4th Gen, so I use iTunes A LOT.  I have a rather extensive video collection amassing on my PC as well as close to 18,000 MP3s (all legal I might add).  The Apple TV really has changed the way I view TV now.  The seamless integration of all my various iOS devices with the Apple TV box is nothing short of spectacular.  It opens up the ability to start watching a movie on TV, then continuing the movie on the iPad, iPod Touch or iPhone.  Also, let's say you are out running errands and you are listening to music on your iPod, when you arrive at home, all you have to do is select Apple TV from the menu on the music player and Viola! You can listen to your music through your home entertainment system.  With all the features this little box offers, I now wonder why I ever hesitated to buy one.With the newest version of this box, you can now view streams in full 1080P HiDef. It also gives you access to the internet, so you can find out of town radio stations, your favorite YouTube or Vimeo videos, watch movies on Netflix, stream pictures to your TV with Flickr or PhotoStream, and lots of other cool and useful things.  Now, I know there are some people out there who think that a TiVo and negates te need for an Apple TV or, vice versa, but let me assure you, they are complimentary of each other.  With TiVo you can record shows off the TV and store them either on the TiVo box itself, or on a network-connected PC/Mac with the TiVo Desktop software.  The Apple TV allows you to stream all forms of multimedia from your computer or the internet.With Apple TV, the realm of digital media becomes more of a close reality.  I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys collecting movies, music, or any form of media, on the computer.  Or, if you just enjoy renting a movie for the weekend, this is for you too.  The selection is by far larger than any cable television's On Demand or Pay-Per-View content offerings.Not really a complaint, more of a suggestion for Apple.  The Apple TV can only be connected to one TV.  It would be great if it could be connected wirelessly to multiple TVs so you could watch your favorite shows in any room in your house, on any connected TV.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Where are the channels?!", "Author": "D.

I prefer and love my PC so I will give my best unbiased review of the AppleTV. My reason for buying the AppleTV was three fold: (1) I wanted the ability to integrate my home theater system with my computer media (music, movies, and photos) both wired and wirelessly, (2) I wanted to project what I was doing on my iPad to my television for guests to see without having to look over one persons shoulder, and (3) I wanted to easiest user interface for both my family and guests to be able to use without needing assistance.With those three items in mind, the AppleTV has met each one of my needs. It has the functionality of streaming internet videos as well through Netflix, YouTube, etc... but those are all just icing on the cake. As far as the hardware product itself, the newest version of the AppleTV has added the functionality of 1080p which is why I waited to purchase the newest model. Apple was behind the market in this category as other competitor products had 1080p capabilities long before. A quick rundown:Pros:(1) The accessibility of integrating your entire home theater system with your personal media collection from your computer or iPad.(2) The ability to mirror the iPad display for everyone to see on the TV.(3) The ease of the user interface for first time users.(4) As a plus, the size of the product is extremely small and easy to install. Only requires a power outlet and an HDMI cable.Cons: Apple's locked down software only allows for videos in your iTunes account to be viewed on the AppleTV. Knowing that before I purchased, I did not take away a star.Summary: I knew what I was getting before I made my purchase of the new AppleTV and it did not disappoint. In fact, because of the ease of installation, use of interface, and quality build of product it has met and in some ways exceeded my expectations. I await the day when the PC market will produce similar products with superior user interfaces.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "People who claim fraud are uninformed", "Author": "T.

Once you have it running you have access to a ton of programing and it comes in clearer than my cable signal! Here's the best part, I can stream Amazon Prime movies FREE using the \"Air Play\" feature on my iPad 2 and/or iPhone 4!!I was wondering if \"Air Play\" would work in this way and it does! Once you setup the Apple TV all of your mac devices will show you an \"Air Play\" icon in and obvious area of the application you are using. When you press the icon you will begin seeing what ever was on your device screen on your TV! Works perfect! The sound is great too, in stereo! I watched a movie last night streaming from my iPhone!! I think there is also supposed to be a \"mirror\" feature of Air Play that lets you see the image both on your device and your TV but apparently, it doesn't work on my older devices. So, what you see on your device is a black screen with a message that says \"Your movie is playing on Apple TV.\"One issue to beware of, in my understanding, is that the \"Air Play\" feature is not be available on computers that are older than mid 2011 except for iTunes. So, I have been streaming movies most of the time from my iPad. Not sure why Air Play will not work with older computers unless it is because I have not installed the latest OS X. I am running  OS X 10.8.5 and the AirPlay icon will not show up when I stream an Amazon Prime movie from either of my mid 2010 iMacs. I can however, get AirPlay to work though iTunes and can play anything in my iTunes library through Air Play from my mid 2010 iMacs.Of course you can also rent or even buy movies from iTunes also. It has Netflix and hulu too!When I first setup the apple TV, I had some problems getting it to play a movie without loosing the signal and then waiting for it to re-buffer again to begin playing. I found out that where I had my TV in relation to my wifi was causing it to receive a weak signal. I have my wifi coming from my Apple Time Capsule in the basement office of our home while the TV is up one floor. I checked the signal strength by using my laptop and placing it near the tv and going online and doing an internet speed test. I found that I was only getting about 3 mbps! Once I moved the Apple TV over to the other side of the TV stand and moved it forward about 6 inches the signal jumped up to 25 mbs! That solved the problem and we have since been watching movies every night!I have since installed an Apple Airport Express which can be used to boost your wifi signal from one area of your home to the next. It was super easy to setup and it simply joined my network on the Time Capsule when I plugged it in and asked me if I wanted to use it to expand my wifi network. Now I have a much stronger signal in the upper area of our home!If you have all Apple products like we do with 3 computers an iPad and Two iPhones, this is a must have!

Why get an Apple TV?  Apple iPad integration, iTunes library access on my HDTV, and a need for speed!Side by side the Apple TV device blows my Roku away in terms of grabbing streaming content, buffering it, and getting it to play.  I love that!  Apple TV also offers up the cool features of syncing with my iTunes library and AirPlay with my iPad.  I love that too!What I don't love about the Apple TV is that it doesn't support Amazon Instant Video.  Maybe with future upgrades or generations it will, but for now, this newest version doesn't and that gives the advantage to Roku in terms of programming options.Roku also offers a bunch more 'channels' to surf than Apple TV, but Apple TV's ability to stream podcasts from iTunes evens things out for me.If you have HBO, you can use the AirPlay function to stream HBO content via the Apple TV to your HDTV.  AirPlay also allows iPad users to mirror what they are doing on their iPad to an HDTV with Apple TV connected to it.Apple TV gives you options like a plethora of Internet radio stations to listen to, FLICKR, and sports subscription channels.The downside to Apple TV is the price, but despite that, I'm glad I spent nearly double what I paid for my Roku on this device.  It's sleek interface runs smoothly (update it when you hook it up so you have the latest firmware) and quickly, and Netflix, HuluPlus and YouTube look great when played on the Apple TV.With AirPlay (super cool way to stream video from your iPad to your TV) and a free iTunes app called 'Remote', you can play your downloaded movies and TV programs from iTunes via the Apple TV.If you don't have an iTunes account, music library or iPad, you may want to stick with Roku with the bonus of a lower price and Amazon Instant Video.Apple TV is great except for its lack of Amazon syncing and limited channel add-ons.  Despite those faults (and the reason for the 4 out of 5 rating), it's really a fantastic piece of hardware with impressive speed and Apple product integration, making it worth a purchase in my book.7/1/13 - UPDATE:Be sure to do the software update to this device when prompted, or check in settings for the update.

For example, you can listen to Sirius or Pandora through the TV and control it from the iPad wirelessly. Apple TV also has built-in apps for Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and a few other services if you're so inclined.  The $100 price tag is not bad considering the capability it gives you.

The iTunes store is the main source where you will greatly benefit from the 1080p. There are quite a few tv shows and movies in 1080p in the iTunes store to rent or buy. If your buying this device for 1080p on Netflix then there still aren't that many movies or tv shows. Also it's very hard to find which ones are 1080p.  Unlike the iTunes store which has icons for HD which means 720p and other icons for 1080p. The Netflix app only has icons for standard definition and HD. From my experience Netflix streaming had very bad picture quality.  The picture seemed to be artifacted and pixelated even with HD content. I had no issues with same content on my apple tv 2 or any of my other netlix devices on my 32mbps connection. I'm guessing that my apple tv 3 was defective as I haven't heard complaints of my issues. There are many threads on macrumor forums and apple discussions forums about the same issue. From my experience the picture quality was only bad on Netflix. Regardless of my issues I still feel the apple tv 3 is not up to par with other streaming devices.  Just about any streaming device (gaming consoles, blu ray players and media boxes) offer many more options in terms of services). In addition alot of them are cheaper or at the same price of the apple tv3. The newer apple tv does has have a faster processor and more RAM than the previous version.

So far I'm impressed with the overall quality of what you can get through this tiny device.For one thing, 1080p content seems to be somewhat less compressed than other solutions I've seen. Given adequate bandwidth, and the same 1080p title looks better on the Apple TV than it does on some other services. Many people don't realize that 1080p alone isn't really a guarantee of any particular quality...just as important is the degree of compression applied to the video data. Broadcast quality 1080p often comes out of the camera at 60mb/sec. The best Blu-ray DVDs are about 40mb/sec...even top-end consumer video cameras are in the 24mb/sec range. Apple TV is 8mb/sec, but most of the competing products are maybe half this, meaning that while the Apple is tough on bandwidth, it gives you a better looking picture. To me, this alone is worth the price of the unit.Speaking of bandwidth, I find I just can't get adequate performance on wireless, so I've generally preferred to connect the Apple TV directly to my router with an Ethernet cable. A little less convenient, but overall much more stable. Of course, I use wireless from my computers to the Apple TV, but for online content, the wired approach gives me a much better experience (I have 35mbps Verizon FiOS).The other thing I love about the Apple TV is the included Airplay. My iPad2 not only streams music and videos, I can mirror my desktop to the Apple TV and project my iPad's desktop onto the big screen. As others mentioned, this feature is coming to Mac OS X in an upcoming release and will be a very handy way to display Mac content on the big screen. It seems to work quite well wirelessly, with just a slight delay.Overall, this little device is definitely worth the investment if you have adequate network capacity.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "After a rough start, Apple TV is amazing!", "Author": "Steve Z \"Steve\"", "ReviewID": "R29UWT69SFSY9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got my Apple TV yesterday. Setup was a breeze. At first I absolutely loved everything about it, a step up from my Roku for sure. Then I used AirPlay to stream a few videos from my iPhone 5. The video was excellent but the audio was choppy (it was also very choppy when I streamed songs from my Windows 7 desktop running iTunes using Home Sharing). This was a deal breaker for sure. I spent a few hours tweaking my wireless router configuration (Actiontec wireless router for Verizon FiOS) with no improvement. I was about to pack up the Apple TV and send it back when I remembered that it had an optical audio output on the back. I connected the optical cable directly to my Onkyo receiver and voila! No more choppy audio. Seems the problem is with my Samsung HDTV panel and not the Apple TV (audio path was Apple TV -> HDMI -> Samsung HDTV -> optical cable -> Onkyo receiver). Now I can say without a doubt that the Apply TV absolutely ROCKS! Excellent video quality, excellent audio quality (now)... love Netflix streaming with this device too. Last night my wife and I used the AirPlay feature to stream a rented movie from our iPad 3 to the Apple TV... played perfectly and without any issues. Today I've been streaming Netflix, HBO GO, and even Amazon Prime videos (from my iPhone 5) without any issues. I've even used AirPlay on my MacBook Pro to display my desktop on the Apple TV. At this point I can safely say that I've put it through its paces (AirPlay via iPhone 5, iPad 3, MacBook Pro, and Netflix and HBO GO via internal apps, and iTunes streaming from iTunes Match (both music and radio) with excellent results. I'm 100% satisfied because it does everything so well and effortlessly.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor Netflix Video", "Author": "c wildenauer", "ReviewID": "R24X3YS8NEA6P6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Poor Netflix Video quality.

It can (under the right circumstances) play all your iTunes Match music, play Netflix/Vimeo/Hulu Plus/Youtube/iTunes videos, display your Photostream as a screensaver, and Airplay from your iPhone/iPad/iTunes PC/Mac.You'll notice that of the capabilities I listed above, many require some investment in the Apple infrastructure. I have that investment, with something like 8 Apple devices in my house from iPhones to a Mac Pro, and also have iCloud, iTunes Match, and a substantial iTunes library. Most of the function between Apple devices and the Apple TV works well. Unfortunately, the Apple TV's basic functions have serious issues.iTunes Match is the first major issue. I use both of them heavily. I already revealed my opinion of iTunes Match, which has been very difficult and problematic since I got it. If you set your Apple TV to stream iTunes Match music, it *will* freeze up every once in a while and stop playing until you tell it to start again. Very fast internet will not help you here, this is an Apple server problem. If you're running a PC or Mac with Homesharing enabled (and you should be) you can play your music from that, and it works like a charm. Of course, this requires you downloading the songs you want to hear ahead of time, which destroys the point of streaming.Photostream is a very cool feature that unfortunately doesn't seem to work properly for the majority of users. Google \"photostream apple tv 3 issues.\" My Apple TV recognized 268 photos out of about 700 I keep on Photostream, and will not recognize the others, despite updates and system resets. Do not get Apple TV for the Photostream feature, because there's no guarantee it will work.Netflix and other video applications work very well on the Apple TV - it streams 1080p content without a hitch (provided of course you have decent internet). Unfortunately, there are some serious issues with the Apple Remote. It's a great looking and feeling little device, but is not completely functional. For example, to change Netflix audio settings and subtitles, the Apple TV tells you to \"hold down the Select button.\" All that does is pause the video. In order to change these settings, you need to use the Remote App on your iPhone or iPad or iPod touch. Luckily that won't be a problem for most people, because so many households have one of those, but it's still an awfully annoying oversight. You can't watch Netflix videos with subtitles *unless* you use your other iOS device - and there are a number of similar, basic things you can't do without an iOS device.I'm keeping my Apple TV. I like what it does right - the interface, the aesthetics, and the functionality of iTunes Match (when it works), plus Airplay works well with my other devices. I could not recommend it to anyone who isn't willing to spend a few hours a month troubleshooting it. I really wish at this point that I had picked Google Music over iTunes Match, but since I didn't I'm willing to work with this sub-optimal device. If I wasn't reliant on iTunes I would switch to a Roku in a heartbeat, since they are vastly superior and easier to use in my experience.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "With Some Workarounds,

I got the Roku 2 first but like this device better for one reason.  AirPlay, yep, that's it.  AirPlay and mirroring are distinct advantages that no other player can offer.  It is the one reason why this device is better than all of the other streamers on the market.  The key is easy workarounds and enabling iPad Mirroring to get around any deficiencies in content.PROS*Small compact size, lightweight*1080P - Full HD, progressive scan*AirPlay - A distinct advantage over all other players - the killer app if you will*iTunes Library Available with iTunes Match*iCloud - Ties in beautifully with all other Apple devices*Netflix, Youtube, Hulu Plus, HBO GO - See my video review for all available channelsCONS*Price, more expensive than other units*AirPlay can be glitchy if someone else in your house is streaming*No HDMI cord provided in box*Limited content, no way to add additional content from the device but you can get around this by downloading Apps*Workarounds can be tricky to figure out, a lot easier nowadays with Google though, in all fairness*Not everything is AirPlay compatible or can be mirroredREVIEWAs stated above, my first experience was with the Roku 2 XD.  It streams 1080P beautifully and has the big three, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu Plus.  It also has tons of channels that you can add to it but no Youtube and no way to connect to the internet.  Apple TV has Netflix and Hulu Plus but no Amazon.  Probably because they don't like those Kindle tablets...however, there is a very easy workaround.  If you download the Amazon Instant Video App to your iPad or iPhone it is AirPlay enabled meaning you can push the content right to your TV!  This is a very easy workaround and the quality is very good.Next, we got this device to put the live Fios stations from their App to our TV so we didn't have to pay Verizon $15 bucks a month for a set top box.  Well, the joke was on us because this App was not AirPlay enabled and would not allow any mirroring - in short, you are stuck watching this on your iPhone or iPad.  This is just Fios wanting you to get another set top box...annoying, but is standard play in the content war game.  Just like Apple TV not supporting Amazon....luckily Amazon is a good guy and built-in the workaround.The mirroring works great, can get glitchy at some times but if you keep other people off of the internet (not streaming) you will be fine.So we talked about the big three, iTunes & iCloud are nice features, the 1080P quality is there...and AirPlay and mirroring are distinct advantages over all of the other players on the market.  You will need to download the CBS, ABC & FOX Apps, turn AirPlay on, lock the orientation of the screen and then open the App.  For some reason you need to lock the orientation of the screen prior to starting the App or else the mirroring is sideways.  NBC and Fios won't allow AirPlay or mirroring so you just need to play around with the stations and their Apps to see what is going to work for you.  That is the workaround for live TV...works great if your network and your shows are on there....or you just get Hulu Plus...You can watch a bunch of stuff on Youtube as well and that seamlessly just pushes to the TV.  So, the content is out there, you just have to do a little experimentation to see what will and will not work.Because you can get the big three plus AirPlay this device is the one to get. Chromecast doesn't have mirroring - so all of those ABC, CBS and FOX shows won't play.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "good, but very limited", "Author": "Doug Gold", "ReviewID": "R3LEZ1OIIB4J2Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was able to get the apple TV setup pretty quick, it did have problems reading my Wifi network and I called apple and they had a fix within 5 minutes.

I can watch my shows free through those apps (even the newest episodes if you watch within a week of them first airing). It has tons of other perks too! HBO! All the shows and movies free and on your own time. Lots of other apps for shows and movies and music (including sports) You can bring up all your photos etc..... Literally anything u can do with your other Apple gadgets (Aside from making phone calls I assume).What you need to know:an HDMI cable is not included so you need to buy one if you don't have an extra. They're only a few dollars on amazon. If u don't have wireless internet you'll also need an Ethernet cable. And optional is an audio optical cable if u want it. But I don't need it apparently becaus mine is working perfectly without it.Lastly, I had issues figuring out how to enable \"home sharing\" and \"airplay mirror\". You have to turn on home sharing from a Mac or PC through iTunes. It can't be done from iPad, iPhone or Apple TV. I just downloaded iTunes for my PC and turned it on though there. For turning on \"mirror\" you go to the home screen of your iPhone or iPad and swipe up from the bottom. When the menu slides up click \"airplay\" and \"Apple TV\" and switch to \"yes\" and it'll pop up on your tv screen (when you have your Apple TV screen on).I highly recommend it to do away with a high cable bill. Nowadays you can watch your shows free through apps and since this allows you to bring them up on your tv it's perfect. And watch it when you want without paying for DVR service. I hear amazon fire is pretty cool and I don't doubt it one bit. But if you have Apple products already I say this is a must to link them all together.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "THE BEST of it's kind, bar none.

For only fifty bucks, I don't see how you can beat it as the \"first\" choice for people seeking alternatives to cable, over-the-air programming, and DVD players.  In fact, both of my children's families have dropped cable and moved exclusively to Roku plus Netflix and Amazon for all of their needs.  My wife prefers cable and uses Roku for an occasional Netflix stream.That leaves me as the Apple TV guy, and this is the 2nd one I've purchased of Apple's 3 editions.  The box can be more temperamental than Roku, requiring the right settings on your computer and mobile devices, as well some limited knowledge about the device's interaction with iCloud and your various media libraries (iTunes will increase its usefulness)..  Also, the buyer should first be made aware that, unlike Roku, Apple TV does not give the user access to Amazon Prime services and features. Finally, for some reason each time I'm finished using Apple TV, I simply can't produce the necessary blinking \"start-up\" light the next time I use it unless I first go to the floor, unplug the device, wait a few seconds, then replug.  (It's probably good exercise for me, but some of us can be obsessive about ensuring that consumer media technology functions as flawlessly as its claims)  This 3rd generation Apple TV is far more reliable than my previous generation model, which eventually wouldn't even let me select \"Settings,\" but I was disappointed at the discovery that it would still require unplugging the device from AC before each use (maybe my \"unsmart\" TV is at fault).Unlike some, I don't require Apple TV simply to be able to hear my collection of music or to see my photos and movies in a room where there's a paired, compatible television set.  But I do find that the combination of the ITunes Store, with its vast holdings and resources, plus the availability of YouTube (not available on my Roku box), make up for the absence of Amazon content.  Moreover, I'm amazed at the effectiveness of \"Air Play\", which enables the user to \"mirror\" movies and videos on an iPod, iPad, or iPhone on a large TV screen--and in detail that's strikingly sharp.  (I would watch music videos streamed from Youtube all day long if it were my choice.)  One caveat: not all features are available to users who don't have Apple mobile devices or a computer with the iTunes program on it. Also, although I can \"mirror\" my computer's desktop onto my television set, the image is so dull I'm not inclined to use this feature.As for ChromeCast, it's far more limited in program content than either Roku or Apple TV and is, imo, fully valued, even at its current low price.  The ChromeCast device itself (which is nothing more than an extra-large thumb drive) was resistant to a secure HDMI connection in the back of my TV, and its attached short cord that must be plugged into a nearby USB port is a nuisance disproportionate to the reward.The best I can say for ChromeCast, when comparing it to the other two, is that it doesn't require a remote control (which is constantly getting lost).  I keep ChromeCast only for emergency use--should either of the other two boxes fail to access Netflix or \"throw\" a Youtube video on to my TV screen (which I rarely have time to watch--figuring out these gadgets takes up too much of it).  Some owners claim that Chromecast is the best of the three for \"multitasking.\"  Regardless, I'm happy to leave such activities to those who are more versatile than I.  Moreover, the device works best with computers that have Google's Chrome browser installed, and by habit I simply can't use anything other than Apple's Safari browser.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not perfect, but better than nothing", "Author": "D.

It's an audio/video streaming device like the Roku and it's a wireless connection device between your iPad and your television - that's the \"Airplay\" feature.  My family has both the most recent Roku and the Apple TV. The Roku and the Apple TV have more similarities than differences. Both are compact, easy to set up, compact, have a simple menu navigation system and provide excellent streaming. Not surprisingly, the Apple TV features iTunes store rentals and purchase of music and movies and Apple Radio. The Roku doesn't have Apple Store but basically has all the competitors, Vudu, Amazon, etc.  As a device for streaming movies, I'd give the nod to the Roku.  The ace up Apple's sleeve though is the iPad connectivity. With Airplay turned on I can play whatever is on my iPad (iPad 3 in my case) on my television (projector in my case) through the Apple TV. This makes the Apple TV the perfect accessory for a home theater system. Instead of playing my ipad through it's on board speaker or headphones, I can play it through the home theater system speakers while I carry it rather than have it tied to the charging stand.  I stream a lot of Pandora, Sirius/XM and Youtube music videos. Lately I've been getting into Apple Radio also.  The audio and video quality of Airplay streamed content is great. There is some lag (latency) that makes airplay connections unsuitable for most games.  By the way, I tried playing software instruments on the iPad through using the Airplay audio. As I expected, there was too much latency, at least a full second between when I hit the notes and when the sound arrived. I didn't notice the same latency playing movies. The iPad must compensate on streamed video feeds.  I think it would be great if Apple came out with an Audio-only over airplay mode which would allow a huge reduction in latency.  We'll see if it happens.  I'm giving the Apple TV five stars, because for under $100.00, it's a very useful little box.

Harley", "ReviewID": "R9DUDC2U3Y6CU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own both an Apple TV and a Roku 3.  I originally bought the Apple TV but quickly found myself wanting more channels.  As a primarily Apple user, I didn't want to replace the Apple TV because I love the airplay mirroring and streaming from my Mac or iOS devices.  The Apple TV is very fast and responsive, especially compared to the online apps in my Internet capable TV.  So far, I have not encountered any buffering or sync issues with the apple TV.  I originally had it connected with an ethernet cable but after purchasing the Roku, I now run it wireless in the family room.  I keep the Apple TV in the family room so other family members can mirror or stream from their iOS devices.As I mentioned, my only complaint with Apple TV is a lack of channels. The only premium channel available is HBO Go.  However, the only extra premium offered on Roku is Epix.  Also, some of the extra channels are pretty worthless, like SyFy.  Forget full episodes of current and former SyFy faves like Being Human, Helix or Battlestar Galactica.  The SyFy channel on Roku offers nothing more than snippets.  Dozens and dozens of minutes long snippets.  Uh, no thanks.  Apple TV does offer several news, weather, specialty and children's channels (like Disney).  There is no Amazon instant video as offered on Roku.  Movies and television shows that aren't available on any other channels must be purchased through iTunes.  The included remote is small and limited to basic playback functions or text entry using the directional arrows.  A remote app is available for free from iTunes that gives you more flexibility and is much more efficient for certain tasks, especially text entry.  The keyboard in the iOS remote app will make you never again want to use the directional arrows on the bundled remote.  All remotes work through the network, not bluetooth or infrared.  I can actually control the Apple TV in the family room from any other room.  Last week, I was able to display photos from my iPhone two rooms away.  In addition to the iPhone, the app works on iPods and iPads as well.So far, I've had my Apple TV since the end of November.  As of mid-January I have not experienced any major issues with A/V sync or buffering.  It worked flawlessly when I originally had it connected via an ethernet cable.  Once I switched to wifi, I still never encountered any sync issues, however, I'll occasionally get a very quick buffering.  It is infrequent and  doesn't last more than a second or two.  I actually get more buffering delays when watching streaming video wirelessly on much more powerful laptops.If you're trying to decide between Apple TV and Roku, I suggest Roku if you're really into watching online content and want the greatest variety of channels available.  Apple TV currently can't come close to the number of channels offered by Roku.  If you own a Mac or iOS devices and get your content primarily from iTunes or plan to do a lot of streaming /mirroring from your Apple device, Apple TV is a no-brainer.

Mirroring allows you to share the screen of your device on your TV. For example, you should display the screen of your iPad on the TV screen.

Once that is done the startup screen will show up. It will want to link to your home wi-fi network so choose that network and use the enclosed Apple TV Remote to enter the password for the network (if you have a password on your network-if you don't, you REALLY should).APPLE MAGIC: Once you have linked the Apple TV to your Wi-Fi network, and if you have a newer version of your iPhone or iPad, make sure that this device (iPad or iPhone) has Bluetooth enabled (check Settings)  and is on the same network as your Apple TV. Then tap (yes, physically tap) the iPhone or iPad on the Apple TV (just a tap, you're not trying to break it) and the iPhone or iPad will link to the Apple TV which will make setup very very easy because you will be able to use the keyboard on your iDevice rather than the Apple TV Remote. BE ADVISED: this doesn't always work so if it doesn't you will have to complete the setup using the Apple TV Remote. If you have an under 25 child in the house who texts regularly, let them use the Apple TV remote to finish the rest of setup; it's so much easier for them!).Once you have the setup completed, use the Apple TV Remote to select options for you.EASIER: If you have a later iPhone or iPad, go to the App Store and download Remote (it's free). This will allow you to link with your Apple TV and not use the Apple TV Remote, which is a good thing.What fun things can it do?If you have a later model iPhone or iPad, you can project the image on your device directly on your television.If you have iOS 6; Click your home button twice and then slide the apps button to the right until you see a small square with a filled triangle on the bottom half. This is the AirPlay button. Tap it and choose the Apple TV as the source. Then slide the \"Mirroring\" slider to the on position. Within a few seconds your device's screen will show up on your television screen.If you have iOS 7: Slide the controls panel up from the bottom of your home screen. The AirPlay button is labeled. Tap it and choose the Apple TV as the source. Then slide the \"Mirroring\" slider to the on position. Within a few seconds your device's screen will show up on your television screen.You can watch Netflix, YouTube, Sports, you can stream any media that you have purchased from Apple including Music, TV, Movies, etc.You will find that the Apple TV is a welcome addition to your technology.

I watch a lot of TV, but seldom sports programming. I don't often rent a movie and certainly don't buy or collect DVDs, don't go to the theater often. So why do I even need this? I don't. The Apple TV is a Wi-Fi connected gateway to other web portals like Netflix, Hulu Plus, Go HBO, and Apple store most of which seem to require rental fees or paid subscriptions to get content. So beyond the hundred bucks you pay for this Wi-Fi peripheral you have to really want the content to pay extra to these providers in addition to already having working, Wi-Fi and cable or other internet connection services (which are utility subscriptions as well). Can you tell I am not a fan of the subscription payment model? Anyway, Apple TV will allow me to stream iTunes music content from my 2007 model iMac to my music system on a different floor of my home. The iMac has to be awake and iTunes running, however. Also useful, I can mirror my iPad 2 (won't work with the iPad1) and control Apple TV from it using Apple Remote app, and some apps and web sites can access Apple TV directly from the iPad. I can also display anything in my photo library on the iMac or iPad on the HDTV screen and associated surround sound system. Video and display mirroring from the iMac is limited to models 2011 and newer, very sad, but I knew that going in. I found it desirable to bump my cable internet speed from 1.5 Mbs (that's bits not bytes, by the way) to 5 Mbs another $5/mo, since some trailers and other content took a long time to load. This helped, but I think I would need even faster and more costly speed for some streaming HD content to be viewed without breaks. There is a lot of nickle and dime (read $5 and $10) added costs to getting the most out of this device.

Over the past 2 years I have heavily invested in the Apple Eco System. I have IPods, an iPad 2, a 2012 Mac Mini, and now Apple TV (newest version). It's been well stated that there is not a lot available for content outside of the Apple Eco System as compared to Roku, for example.I've hardwired the ethernet connection to my router from the Apple TV, as suggested, to avoid overloading my wireless capability at home.I'm running the latest version of the OS on the Apple TV, Mirroring my Mountain Lion and Ipad screens is very handy.I've updated my review and added a 4th star because the 'wired ethernet causing content load failure' issue has been addressed. The device needs to have more content available and have it available from the Itunes store. That's the only drawback at this point that I see, and it costs 1 star...I have seen one 'bug' in the current version of the software. Loading select Vimeo content caused an error message stating that the content wouldn't load because my TV didn't support the 'HDMC' protocol (an encryption protocol used by newer HDMI devices). Recommended fix was replugging my Apple TV into the TV. That didn't work. Cold booting the Apple TV did fix the issue.As others have stated, this is a no brainer if you already have Apple products, especially newer ones. If you don't have Apple products, then unfortunately at this time, I could not recommend this product to you, it simply wouldn't have the value per the cost to you...

I don't trully understand why this is, but the explanation is something about devices are constantly \"reconnecting\" to the router, and this is what disrupts the atv's performance and ruins everything until fixed.  They say modern routers don't do this, but mine is only a few months old, so I think it's a problem with atv that it doesn't work out of the box or at least make it easier to find this solution which it took me HOURS to find.

So your passion for this device assumes you like/love and/or can at least tolerate iTunes*.A1) Can play visitors music and videos: I assume this only true if they're running iOS devices. Keep forgetting to try with Android bearing guests, but sincerely doubt it would work without special software.B)Truly brain-dead set up (if you bother reading 3 pages of included manual) download it if you lost it.C)Free stuff: Watch/listen to Podcasts, play YouTube, Vimeo, Movie Trailers, Flickr, digital Radio Stations etc. As well as standard paid services (Netflix, Hulu Plus, MLB,WSJ, NFL etc)*Frankly if you're going to purchase an ATV its worth your while to learn how to really take advantage of iTunes capabilities like using smart playlists.CONS:a) They've made your computers media a couple more clicks away than ATV 1 (you used to be able to access from top level (main screen). You have to choose \"Computers\" first..b) Requires Home Sharing (This is a free software service built into iTunes - which determines who can play and or copy your purchased media). While I've never had any problem (even with my PC) some folks (nearly all are PC users) do. It seems this is mostly do to firewall/router settings and/or 3rd party antivirus software. Nonetheless, if you run into an issue, you need to be willing to read thru Apple's KBs on the topic,  (or call Apple and have them walk your thru it if your still under warranty.)c) No way to backdate software without jailbreaking, AND, as of Apple TV Gen 2, you can't disable updates completely (you're asked before updating, but it gets to be a pain constantly clicking \"Don't Update\".)-- A WASH: Pro or Con depending on your needs so YMMV---the Remote: Lots of folks like how simple and small this is. Personally I'd rather have a remote that's less likely to land in the wash. There are actually quite a lot of \"hidden\" commands in the device - like holding down select while playing a video to select chapter, I believe most/all? of these documented online, but personally I'd prefer separate NAMED buttons.No Amazon Video Player: If you don't have another device which has the software, and you really prefer using amazon media only, you might prefer a different device.

I think this device is excellent for what it does. My only complaint with the Roku was that it was flaky and I had to reset it frequently.

My husband pays the Verizon Fios bill, so we take turns as to who pays for the movie on demand.

Again, you would need to read the instructions to know about it.Here are the Cons:- The remote is not self explanatory and you need to read the instructions. I would have preferred to see a button on the remote which was marked \"Select\" instead of just a round silver button within a black circle with arrows pointing North, West, South and East. You need to figure out what that means. For non-techy people, the remote will be an issue.- To go backwards, you need to click the menu button.- To play, if you press the silver buttonBe aware, it needs it's own HDMI input on your television. The better the hdmi connector you use, the better your picture will be. Also, in my opinion, it's better to use an ethernet cable than wireless, especially as our TV area is pretty far from the wireless router.

I had been using a mini-port to HDMI cable to mirror my Mac. Worked great for several months. When I downloaded an HD trailer and tried to play it, the connection flickered out. I tried two different cables to no avail. the connection would come and go (mostly go). I had never been interested in an ATV, but research indicated that it might be a good way to mirror the Mac. Ordered it, set it up, bang: off to the races (I have a late 2011 MBP, so air-play works fine). It is what it is. I don't do a lot of streaming, so I'm not missing the access to various venues mentioned by others. I like the interface with iTunes. The initial reason for my interest in connecting the computer to my home theater system (such as it is) was the ability to drive high impedance headphones. I also enjoy the interface with YouTube. Those rotating still frames are pretty cool. My often lame DSL is slow to load content (and sometimes just fails) but that's not the fault of the ATV. As for mirroring, my only disappointment is the slight lag time. I work in graphics programs via a Wacom tablet and this slight lag is not a good thing (but I don't mind working directly on the Mac these projects). If my local Apple store wasn't constantly crowded, I would have spent some time at the genius bar to see what's up with the lightening port (Apple Care wasn't able to get it figured out, and I found many blog posts about the problem).

When I am visiting friends without cable, Netflix or Hulu, or on the road traveling, I can easily get access to these shows or live streaming if I bring my ATV along with my iPad and connect to an HDMI device.But, outside of ATV's AirPlay mirroring, I am left wondering what else can I do?Apps on ATV are very limiting.  If you are buying this for the current app line up and not Airplay Mirroring, I suggest buying a Wireless Sony Blue Ray DVD player.  Head to head, the DVD player has far more usable apps than Apple does, it plays DVDs, Blue Rays, and even does 3D DVDs... and cost $130 vs $95.  Well worth the extra $35... but it doesn't do AirPlay mirroring.When using AirPlay mirroring, I am limited to controlling streaming from the device which is being mirrored.  With the iPad this isn't a problem... but if I am using the iMac which is located on the other end of the house, this isn't fun, but is good exercise.  I can't even pause a movie.  If your question is why don't you just mirror it from your iPad, well the answer is that not everything can be mirrored from portable devices.  Comcast & HBO have blocked the ability to mirror from your iPad/iPhone, but not the case from my iMac.  It would be nice if the ATV gave some control to pause the iMac in the other room.UPDATE to Mirroring:  HBO recently updated their app and I can now mirror HBO Go on my Apple TV from my iPad.  Additionally, I have been able to use the remote to pause, rewind and fast forward... or simply use my iPad to control everything.  This is a much better improvement and makes me raise my star review to 4 stars.After getting the ATV, I shelled out $25 for a yearly subscription to iTune's Match.  That was 3 weeks ago and 90% of my music has been uploaded.  The first 80% took a few hours, the remaining 20% is taking forever because the music wasn't matched from iTunes catalog.  I understand some of my music isn't on iTunes, but there seems to be some that is on iTunes that isn't getting matched from the iTunes library.  Match allows me to AirPlay my music from the Cloud in another room with ATV without connecting to my computer.  This is especially useful when on the road.Not all Netflix & Hulu apps are the same and ATV wins easily for their interface.  I have these services built in on my Vizio Via TV in our bedroom and the Sony Blue Ray in our living room.  Apple TV wins easily in user interface.  The Sony comes last in quality.  It is a bit wonky, the layout is weird, and reading titles is nearly impossible.  The Vizio is a bit better, but is also limiting.  The Apple TV is clear, easy to navigate and even gives you extra search features in Netflix.  For example, on some movies you can go to the cast list and click on each cast member to find other movies they appear in. The layout is well thought out and easy to navigate. Great!I have high hopes for ATV in the future.  Coming from Apple, I expected more Apps and they should be delivering on this ASAP.  Additionally, giving the user two way control using AirPlay mirroring is much needed.  I should be able to pause my iMac in another room from my ATV.  Finally, ATV will reign supreme if the user can also mirror and control a remote computer from another room on a television using a keyboard/mouse or trackpad... in essence, giving the user the feeling of having a 2nd computer in another room.This is what I expect from Apple and until then I really can't give it a better rating.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Apple Product", "Author": "Daniel Clement", "ReviewID": "R361TUMUFSQLZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product by apple, and I love it.Some things to consider:APPLE TV DOES NOT SUPPORT OLDER TVS.

I should also state that although I have an iPhone and the wife has an iPad, we are not committed to Apple products we have to have no matter what. Having said that, I DO like the minimalist styling of both the unit and its remote.The ATV3 is Apple's 3rd version and besides a few tweaks at previous bugs, the essential difference between this version and the previous ATV2, is that this one supports 1080p HD whereas ATV2 was restricted to a max of 720p. To some that matters, but I personally cannot detect the difference from my sofa! Also, when I checked where it was available to buy, the best deal was on Amazon itself for $88! Free shipping and no sales tax, too. Normal retail is $99 plus tax and the 3-4 days wait wasn't a problem either.The set-up was straighforward. Yes, you could follow the booklet that came with it but all you needed, was the instructions on the screen and you were up and running. You can have it set up wirelessly (WiFi, with a router) or an Ethernet cable (wired). My specific set up was I have a NETGEAR dual band WiFi router in the office next door that provides a wifi hotspot for the wife's iPad and my iPhone (when not using Verizon's 4G network). This particular router stated that it was designed for medium to large homes, several devices simultaneously being used and that it supported streaming HD video. My 7 year-old TV is also capable of 1080p HD res.The box comes with the small, black ATV, a power cord and the Apple remote. You WILL also need a HDMI cable to connect it to your TV, if you don't already have one. You don't need to buy a state-of-the art one with gold plating that'll set you back up to $50; they are available for as little as $20 at Radio Shack or Fry's. Mine was one left by my TV cable company when I switched to using a CableCard instead of using one of their bulky box tops.Had the ATV for a few months now and I'm still learning what you can do with it! It's a work in progress. I would highly recommend getting a book on this device, especially one that includes trouble-shooting. There is one available on this site and it DOES cover the ATV3. Having this companion, I found, is very useful and not too technical following each chapter, depending what it is you're looking for.All in all, I have no regrets in buying this product as I already had the other devices with which it runs. About my only criticism is that the library content on say, Netflix, is not as wide as on the regular mail-in DVD. If you do a search on either, you are more likely to find the physical DVD format available as the same movie as instant streaming. Apple's good but even it and iTunes are not 100% perfect! Maybe they will add more content and encourage more consumers. Already other companies are giving them a good run for their money and there's nothing like healthy competition to get a company to give the consumers what they want, rather than what they think they need!!.......", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!! 1080 looks great", "Author": "dickpimento", "ReviewID": "R3LNTW1Y3J8CLE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is such an easy to use and necessary accessory to anyone that has a Macbook Pro, IPad or even Iphone.

Even without those the device is a bargain and completely idiot proof. :-)Note you can stream many cable channels via iPad - iPhone - iPod apps in HD.

I can overlook Apple TV's lack of Amazon Instant Video because my Blu-ray player has that feature.Old review:I tried both the latest Apple TV (third generation) and Roku 2 XS before deciding on the Roku.In short, the only advantage of Apple TV is its tight integration with iTunes. I also like its remote controller better.But if you are into high quality, free channels, the Apple TV pales by comparison. Even the least costly Roku LT ($50) supports 400+ channels. The channels that I use most are Amazon Instant Video (Amazon Prime members can watch free movies), Crackle (free movies), Cnet, Revision3, Tested, TED, and a number of news channels.Apple TV does NOT support Amazon Instant Video. It is a closed system, compared to Roku's vendor-neutral design.

(I didn't have an extra one so I had to buy another HDMI cable online which prolonged my AppleTV usage for another 2 days) The Airplay feature works amazingly great! I'm very surprised of how easy it was to actually use this feature. At first, I thought I had to install a software, but once the AppleTV was connected, there was an Airplay icon that appeared on my Macbook that I click and BAM! Your desktop is on TV. Resolution on the TV is very nice and it also sends the audio to the TV. I connected this to my Home Theater System so the audio is surround sound as well.The only complaint that I have is when you're connecting to the Wifi, it does not scan for available networks; therefore, you can't click on the available SSID and connect to it. You physically have to type the EXACT SSID. This took me a while because I didn't capitalize a letter, forgot to put a symbol, didn't put correct spacing...etcAlso, I already had the remote control for my macbook pro (Remote configured to my macbook) so I decided to use this remote instead of the one that came with it.Since the remote is already synced with my Macbook, every time use the remote to go through the AppleTV, this would also increase/decrease the volume for my Macbook which was a bit annoying.Photo stream works just as great as it did with my iphone and Macbook. (It does take a while to load all the photo stream photo's onto the Apple TV)The movies that were being offered through the AppleTV were a bit pricey, but that's what Redbox is for.My only intensions of using the AppleTV is solely for Airplay.

I also hope that apple releases a new apple tv with improvements (basically to match the other in hardware).People who are apple fans will love this product, people who have a lot of apple products will love it, people with no apple products will be ok with it, and people who prefer other operating systems (windows, android, linux, etc) will probably prefer the Roku 3 (or maybe chrome cast,or amazon FireTv).", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Kristen D", "ReviewID": "R3GHG07H4S4Z6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We love this.

Both coupled together are minimalist to the point where I could easily see them being very challenging for someone to use, whether or not they are age 50+.  Given the nature of the device mishaps with the remote are not without cost - rewinding your Netflix stream and watching it rebuffer to YouTube quality c. 2006 is not pleasant.  Perhaps if the UI was a bit more informative it'd make up for the remote's shortcomings, but no.I'll also add that the remote is so damn small it is very easily lost - between sofa cushions, underneath papers and magazines, etc etc.  I was ready to take a power drill to the stupid thing and attach a lanyard, but I bought a Fire TV instead.  It too is not without issue (where the hell is Cloud Player?) but it is far and away more user-friendly.Overall - a competent but not inspired piece of equipment.  It's great for NetFlix when you don't have a \"smart\" TV, and that's pretty much all I have ever used it for.  AirPlay streaming is nice; needing to constantly keep a computer on to use it is not.

Lastly, another big draw is the AIRPLAY function which is pretty cool. This allows you to play whatever is on your iPad or iPhone on your tv through Apple TV.

The one thing I should note is the YouTube app does not allow you to comment on YouTube videos after watching them like you can elsewhere.  I would suspect this was because with the tiny remote it would take forever to enter in a few sentences.  However, users can pair an Apple keyboard and that would work well for this.

Airplay is awesome and works perfect from an iOS device, but is very sub par on my macbook pro.

The Apple TV centralizes all of my devices. It connects and streams off my iTunes library and iTunes account. I use it for iTunes Radio as well, but can watch movies and listen to music straight from my computer (good thing because I'm tired of buying HDMI cables that stop working). Additionally, I love AirPlay. If I'm too lazy to go on the YouTube app or can't view something on the Apple TV (because there is not ATV app for it), then AirPlay will just throw it on the screen.That said, there are two things you should also consider that would actually make this thing useful: a good Wi-Fi connection and subscription to services like Netflix or HBO GO etc. The latter is not as important because I know a lot of people just use it to stream from their computer or use the free services that are included, but you can maximize how amazingly convenient this thing is through Netflix or HBO Go services and the like. But I can't stress the importance of Wi-Fi connection. If it's slow or unreliable, it will really diminish the enjoyment of this device.Another thing that I like? I can watch stuff on my own time and interest. I stopped watching TV years ago but I still see how people just mindlessly watch whatever is on, no choice and limited to time (even if they have DVR). Not only that, you don't have to pay $50 for like 4 channels you actually want and 600 others you don't care about.

The first one I purchased to use at home to stream audio from iPhone to my home stereo along with streaming video/pictures from my iPad to my TV.  It worked so well that I bought another one for the office to connect to our 80\" TV that we use in our conference room.  We have a lot of internal people with iPads and iPhones that want to show live content from their idevices that it seemed like a no brainer to hook this up.  We also get quite a few external people that show up to our office for meetings with idevices and want to show content on our screen, so again the Apple TV works great for allowing this to happen.A couple of things to note on this application of Apple TV.One, using AirPlay (the mechanism to connect to Apple TV from a iPad/iPhone) to \"mirror\" your screen to a display/tv will only happen in a 4:3 \"like\" format for the iPad and an even narrower format for iPhones.  So, if you have a wide screen display (i.e. 16:9 or 16:10) then you iPad screen mirror will only take up the center of the screen with black bars on each side.  The image will rotate along with the respective screen orientation of the iPad, so viewing the iPad in landscape mode will fill more of the screen but not all of the screen.  Not a big deal, just a comment.Two, some iPad/iPhone applications can stream directly to Apple TV in full screen mode without having to use AirPlay \"screen mirroring\", so you can fill your entire 16:9 wide screen.  For example the YouTube application can do this and fill the entire TV screen.And lastly, some ipad/iphone applications can deny your ability to use AirPlay to stream to your Apple TV.  For example, I was hoping my Xfinity application would allow me to stream movies to my TV but it told me I was not allowed to use AirPlay. :-(Just things to consider if you want to use the Apple TV for video streaming.  Streaming audio to your stereo system works great!  You need an optical digital input on your stereo to do this, so keep that in mind.  You can even stream music from your computer in iTunes over your network.  The Apply TV can connect to your network over Ethernet or WiFi.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Must have", "Author": "Jay Brower", "ReviewID": "R3R9I3BKNN1FG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the future of TV.  simple to use, links to the apple ecosystem and conntect to (Netflix, HBO, Youtube)", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works every time!", "Author": "strummer281", "ReviewID": "R25Y2HQ0H5MAUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is much better than my ROKU 2.

The processor is not the fastest in its class.  It doesn't offer the largest variety of channels (though there are rumors this will change in the near future).  But, if you have other Apple products (iPhone, iPad, laptop) you can use the Airplay feature to project whatever is one your device onto your TV through the AppleTV.This helps to cancel out the lack of channels.  The feature does not work in all instances.  There are certain apps that do not allow the use of Airplay (the March Madness app is one example).The Roku 3 has more channels and a faster processor, but it does not have an airplay feature.AppleTV also works best when connected via Ethernet as opposed to wi-fi.The appearance is small and discrete but requires sightline for the remote to work. Also, concerning the remote, if you have an Apple laptop the remote controls the volume on your laptop.  This may be an added bonus unless you are on your laptop and someone else is browsing through shows on the AppleTV.  Your volume will increase and decrease with the familiar *blip* each time.  This gets old quick.  I've given up on using my laptop and AppleTV in the same room unless I'm Airplay-ing something from my laptop.All-in-all it isn't bad.

I had both devices connected to different televisions in my home, so if I had a problem with one, I would go to the other and see if the same problem existed. On several occasions, the Apple Netflix would not connect (or would show an error) while the Roku connected every-time. Almost everything on the Apple requires a \"subscription\" (incurring additional costs) while the Roku offers many free viewing selections. (The food channels for recipes and the fitness channels for home workouts are awesome).

The toughest thing about the Apple TV is you are at Apples mercy when it comes to updates at which time they may add one or two new channels, so it really is limited. They do not have Amazon Prime, so I recently purchased the ROKU 3 for that purpose.I guess it's about how you use a streaming device, I don't care about AirPlay; I don't listen to my iTunes on the TV, I don't care about having photos up and I don't rent / buy movies from iTunes. But if you do or like all that this is a five star unit. I just want Prime and maximum streaming options and flexibility, ROKU does that. So don't get me wrong it's like serving a beautifully prepared filet mignon to a vegan! The Apple is best if you; 1. own Apple devices and  2. use them in conjunction with the TV.The other issue I have is the remote has to be very close to the unit and nearly in front to change channels, very annoying. There is an App that takes the place of the remote, and that is certainly useful.Frankly with ROKU at the same price the  Apple doesn't make sense, it  is too limited and not flexible, I should be able to buy Apps the way I do on any Apple product. I cannot recommend.UPDATE: to be fair in reviewing this I am trying out the music channels and they are wonderful! Very surprising fidelity, excellent. Set it up through my receiver and the music reproduction is awesome. Again I continue to feel there are not enough APP options and flexibility compared to the ROKU, but I am among the converted when it comes to what it does offer. I will add I have it connected directly to the router, not WiFi so that helps.I continue to feel it is largely geared to Apple products users, and frankly if it had Prime I wouldn't feel the need for the ROKU. Since I have both I would say if you have to buy only one and want Prime, ROKU is not a compromise.

Yes, you can do this with any tv or blu-ray player with HDMI and a Apple AV cable. However, the proprietary cable costs $50 and the Apple TV costs $85. To me its a no-brainer to by the Apple TV for this use case for an additional $35.Of course all of this assumes you are already heavily invested in the Apple universe with iPhones, iPads, Macs and iTunes, and care about watching iPhone videos and photos on your TV. There is another issue as well. Apple is a content provider though iTunes. They really don't compete with Netflix, as they don't provide a subscription service, so you get that, but they do compete with Amazon for movie rentals, so you don't get an Amazon app. You still need another device to use your Prime streaming or rent movies from Amazon which are cheaper than iTunes. Roku on the other hand isn't an Amazon competitor, so you get Prime along with many more streaming services.Performance wise, the Apple TV has plenty of storage so that buffering and streaming quality don't seem to be an issue. Also the Apple TV has some other potential. They do add content, and there is word that Apple with update the software with more app store-like functionality, so that developers can make apps for it. We'll see. For now its a good unobtrusive player, with Apple universe integration and less content than Roku or XBMC. Well, that is, unless they develop an Apple TV 3 jailbreak.One more thing. Airplay mirroring ONLY natively works with newer Macs with better graphics hardware and iOS devices. To use AIrplay mirroring on older Macs you need to buy the AirParrot app. I can attest that this works well on a ram upgraded late 2008 MBP, but it does use a lot of system resources and spins up the fan quite a bit.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love my Apple TV", "Author": "Brian M.

It was either Apple TV or Roku 3, although I heard about a Western Digital device but I don't know much about it.  I have had many Roku devices and they've all worked fine, but I thought I'd try Apple TV for a change.  I have recently changed over to Apple Ipads and laptops so I thought I'd give it a try.  Well, from my first few hours with it I'm quite impressed!  The YouTube set up is awesome!  The picture is great, the menu works fine, and I couldn't be more impressed. And, YouTube has SO much great content!  You can find just about everything on YouTube, documentaries, full music albums, sermons, speeches, how to videos, movie clips, you name it and it's probably on YouTube!  And I have the Roku2 with all it's supposedly great channels.  But you know what I use it for?  Netflix, Amazon, and Vudu.  That's it!  Crackle sucks, it has commercials, and PBS is cool but it's on Apple TV as well.  The other thing I liked about Apple TV was the Airplay connection where you can stream from your MacBook, Imac, Ipad, or cell phone to your TV.  I tried it with a MacBook and it couldn't be more simple!  I streamed some Coursera courses on it from my Macbook, and it worked flawlessly!  The Neflix interface is a little snazzier on the Apple TV, a little more slick and prettier than the Roku.  The one thing I don't really like that much is the Apple TV Remote.  It's kind of hard to get used to, I was always pushing the middle button accidently when scrolling.  It's also very small and about 1/8\" thick and I wonder when I'm going to sit on it and break it.Other than that, like I said, I'm VERY impressed!  I'm glad I got the Apple TV instead of the Roku 3 which people seem to be having problems with.  But, I also kept my Roku2 and use it along side the Apple TV.  You just have to make sure you have a few HDMI slots on the back of your TV, which most TV's do have nowadays.  The Apple TV also is a nice piece of technology.  It is a lot heavier than the Roku, and doesn't seem \"plasticky\" like the Roku, but more like a solid hockey puck.  It's as easy to set up as it is to get a laptop hooked into your network, doesn't take 5 minutes.  All in all I'm impressed with the feel of the device, the interface is typical Apple cool, and everything works exactly as you would want it to.

I wanted to show videos and slide presentations loaded on the mini Ipad to a larger television screen. This gave me that capability but also is a great way to access photos and ITunes music playlists through my home network (As long ITunes is up and running on the Windows 7 PC in my home office).  Thirdly, it's a very good way to access streaming video applications such as Netflix or Hulu. The streaming capability seems to produce better sound and picture clarity than my Sony Blue Ray DVD players or PS3 with less buffering.  I hooked Apple TV through my Bose home theater system (which even had a setup expressly for Apple TV). Apple TV produces Dolby 5.1 surround sound through my Bose system quite nicely. It seems like a cost-effective way to add service to a television in that part of the house where you don't have cable or satellite television service connections.The main down side is that many of the applications do require that you have a service such as Direct TV or Xfinity somewhere in the house.  And you will need a home wireless internet network. Hulu Plus, HBO Go, and Pandora are now among many services offered by Apple TV, so there's a nice variety of applications available, some requiring subscriptions service (such as Netflix) or service from a tv provider (such as ABC, Disney, and HBO Go applications.)

The Computer part of Apple TV only streams from iTunes software on Mac or PC.However, with the help of a free app called MoliPlayer HD -- I first used this app last year on my Nokia Windows Phone -- and the wonderful AirPlay, it's a cinch to network-play my files on my NAS, a Diskstation product.  MoliPlayer HD can access any server or computer on your LAN (local area network), and play pretty all the video and audio formats out there.  The free version doesn't allow you to password-protect the app, but otherwise has all the major functions.  I just launch MoliPlayer HD, go to Nearby on the left, and it accesses my DiskStation as well as my Windows workgroup immediately. I then turn on AirPlay to send the media content to my Apple TV.The Apple TV is truly simple and elegant, and it just works.  I went through several Android-based media players but they were all difficult to use, froze frequently, not to mention anything from Google is reported to spy on you and your family.  On the Apple TV I can rearrange the app icons just like on iPhone or iPad. I can easily get rid off unwanted icons through the Restrictions settings.

Of course the NAS drive has an iOS app which lets me Airplay it to my TV via the Apple TV.  Fantastic!The downside is that it's not an end all solution for television.  I dropped TV service completely so I've tried every other alternative, including watching TV shows through websites.  Netflix and other apps are supported here, but they don't have everything, so beyond that its out of my hands whether or not a website will let me Airplay to the Apple TV.  iPad mirroring is cool, but the aspect ratio is different so streaming full screen video isn't full screen on your TV (I don't like that).However if you're looking for TV solutions consider this: the average TV service is about $50 per month.  On Apple TV you can buy a full season of a TV show for about $30.  So in a year's time, you could own a full season of 20 different shows for the same $600 you would have spent on cable or dish.

I didn't think I would notice as much difference as I do, and the 1080P programming on iTunes is just gorgeous. I'm re-watching things like the scenes in Breaking Bad with those gorgeous New Mexico landscapes and the detail and picture quality is wonderful. I'm on an old Sony HDTV, which is 1080P, although only 60 hz, so I expect the picture quality may be even better on newer TVs. So, a big thumbs up for the 1080p picture and ITMS programming content.The other big plus with this device, is that if you are in the Apple ecosystem, everything just works. iPhones and Macs can copy their screen content to this gadget with a single click. Simply wonderful. Last summer I used my iPhone and the previous Apple TV to watch the Tour de France using the NBC iPhone app and streaming it to the Apple TV. For $15, I got commercial free, near-HD quality live from the Tour. It was the best TdF coverage I've ever watched and a bargain.Apple has added many services to ATV: PBS, Hulu, Smithsonian, etc, but you don't get all the choices of something like a Roku. However, between Netflix, iTunes, PBS, Smithsonian, Comedy Central I have more programming than I can watch, and it's quality stuff, not the BS of 300+ cable channels that I never look at.ATV let me cut the cable cord years ago, and I've never missed it.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Apple TV", "Author": "Scott D.

So what is a downside of Apple TV? Honestly there is not much but a few things you should think about before buying one.If you are just wanting Netflix and could care less about viewing photos, mirroring displays, renting or buying movies and TV shows or playing music then Chromecast might be a better option for you. It's also less then half the price of an Apple TV.There are other options out there such as Roku. Roku is more open and has access to a bit more content, but that content is more obscure for most people and Apple TV has all the big players on board.  Where Apple TV is better then a Roku IMHO is interface and usability.  Roku is great but the interface can at times be slow and annoying. Apple TV has it's issues here and there as well, but using both for the last few years I get far fewer issues with my Apple TV, and Roku is very slow to update when issues arise.  So if you are the kind of person that has to have every single content provider under the sun a Roku is a damn fine device. If you are looking for all the best mainstream content with a lot of extras and a smooth interface then Apple TV may suit you better.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Hit Christmas Gift", "Author": "Sarah Carlson", "ReviewID": "R3ACU410RP4JC2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Apple TV was great for a christmas present t o my mom and dad.

Very sleek looking, uses little power, and integrates with all your iPhones and iPads.  The quality of the video is awesome.  Mine is streaming over 5ghz wifi without a hitch.  Perhaps those that complain about video quality do not have the proper router.  Regardless, mine streams perfectly.Here is why this works for me: I subscribe to DirecTV.  I have two set-top boxes (one in the family room and one in the living room).  Each of those TVs also has an Xbox 360 and a blue ray player attached.  The TV in my bedroom has no set-top box, no 360, and no DVD player.  It simply pulls in beautiful free HD over the air.  Enter Santa and my Apple TV.All in all I am happy with the unit.  The Netflix app is not as user friendly as the Xbox app, however, it gets the job done.  I like that I can pull content from iTunes and or my networked computer.  Air Play is really cool.  Where it is lacking is APPS!  I would like Flixster, Amazon Prime, and just more content.  I will use ESPN, MLB, NETFLIX, and the Disney apps when the kids come in and snuggle with my wife and I on the weekends.I like the unit and am glad Santa brought it.  However, it may not work for your specific needs.  The Roku may be more of what you are looking for.  They need to crank out more apps!UPDATE 1/6/2014:I bought a Roku 3 as well.  Both are great boxes but I think I actually prefer the Apple TV.  I ordered another unit and just canceled Direct TV.  I have the best of both the Roku and Apple TV.

I'm an Apple Fan.  I have a MacBook, iPad, and iPhone.  BUT when deciding to get rid of our satellite TV to try a more affordable option, I was really unsure which to go with, the Apple TV or Roku.  I read countless reviews.  Both had pros and cons.  I ended up buying both.  The Apple TV for our main television, and the cheaper Roku LT for additional TV's in our home.After trying both....... I'm still an Apple Fan.  What Apple TV lacks in 'pre-set' channels, can easily be streamed from my MacBook, iPad & iPhone to the Apple TV through AirPlay.  (Except NFL!!  But I can't figure out how to watch from the Roku either)  My husband 'settled' for NFL rewind (at a nominal fee) but it can only be viewed on the iPad.  He's semi-satisfied.  Amazingly enough, the minute you attempt to airplay it, it shuts down the stream.  The NFL has their controls!!The Roku has more flexibility to add or remove channels (including 'private channels') or use Plex Play.  I really haven't found any incredible private channels I can't live without.  Plex Play is kind of a pain to set up.  I had to do a lot of browsing/reading to figure it all out.  If you're an Android fan, I believe there is now an App that works with many Roku Models for streaming from Android devices.  At this time, it's not available for the Apple devices.In my opinion, Apple Products are well made.  The cute little Apple remote is metal, not plastic.  It's easy to set up and easy to use (even for my anti-tech Husband)If you have Apple devices, simplify your life and stick with the Apple TV.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple TV: Nice device with room for improvement.

I'd give it a higher stars rating if it offered additional functionality:WISH LIST ITEMS1. A native APP to watch AMAZON PRIME videos.Currently (Dec 2013), it is possible to watch AMAZON PRIME videos by streaming them from an iPhone, iPad, iPod to the Apple TV via AirPlay, and while that's an improvement over the original feature-set, it is not as convenient as a native APP just like NETFLIX or HBOGO.2. Improved and expanded Apple's \"Remote\" APP functionalityThis app allows the user to control the Apple TV from an iPhone or iPad or iPod similarly as the remote control that comes included with it... In other words, you need to turn your TV on, and select the desired icon from those displayed on your TV screen. To some degree, that is OK if you want to watch a movie. What if you want to listen to iRADIO? It should be possible to select that icon right on the iOS device screen without having to turn on the TV. So, what I am proposing here, is for the Remote APP to show the same menu options on the iOS device screen as on the TV.3. Capability to turn on an A/V receiver automatically when streaming music via AirPlay to the AppleTV, and have the receiver select its input automatically to whichever HDMI port the AppleTV is connected to, and start playing the music \"with just one click\". This is what takes place if you start streaming music from an iPhone or other Apple device to receivers with built-in AirPlay capability such as Denon or Pioneer, and it would be particularly helpful with ONKYO's receivers which don't have built-in AirPlay capability at this time.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome for every TV in house.", "Author": "Stow Fresh", "ReviewID": "R1MHG2B1SRBGTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with this device.

Personally, I use Apple TV for watching TV, Movies, and for airplay (mirror what\u2019s on my iphone or ipad right onto the tv).  However, the device offers far more options that I have not yet taken advantage of.How do I watch TV and Movies?  Well there are mainy ways to do so with Apple TV.  Here are the ways that I\u2019ve tried and enjoyed:1) HBO GO channel:  If you subscribe to HBO already, this is a fantastic way to watch HBO content.  This is one of my favorite uses of Apple TV and probably worth the cost of the device in and of itself (for me).2) Netflix Instant:  Another great channel and you can set it up so there\u2019s a designated area for kids or adults.  We have it set up so the kids have one channel with only acceptable content.  We use this a lot.3) Airplay: I sometimes use this to mirror what\u2019s on my iphone or ipad right onto the tv.  Great for pictures or videos I may want to show family members.  That\u2019s mainly how I use this feature, but you could do more with it (like watch movies or shows).4) Other Channels:  Youtube, Disney, and a few others I use on occasion.5) Itunes:  I rarely rent or purchase shows or movies from itunes, but easy to do from Apple TV.  Plus it\u2019s easy to access old content you may have purchased.Other Information:Set-up:  I thought the set-up was easy. Opened up the package, connected device, and it turned on.  It took a few minutes to log-in and link to my wi-fi, but pretty straight forward.Remote:  Small and simple to use.Apple TV Device:  Very small and looks exactly like the picture.Cords:  Comes with HDMI connector.Picture:  I\u2019ve had no issues.  Everything seems to work just fine for me, but I imagine this could be a factor if I had a very slow network at home (glad I don\u2019t).  Something to keep in mind though.Automatic System Updates:  This is a plus since there are periodic updates (adding channels or features).  Like other apple devices this runs smooth.I\u2019ll update this review as I try more features, but overall I haven\u2019t noticed anything that\u2019s made me regret purchasing this.

I've given one to my parents & one to my sister none who are tech savvy, but they love how easy it is to use. To be fair I own a Ruko & Netgear Net-Neo as well and have found myself using the Apple over the other two. It's simple, no useless buttons and pretty much idiot proof for me :) The best feature in my opinion is the ability to add your own movies, tv shows and music to box. I've added home movies, purchased DVDs and lots of other stuff I can't add to the other streaming boxes. Plus I love using my iPhone, iPad or iPod to stream music, videos or whatever so easily. The pictures comes out clear, the sound crystal and no hiccups in the streaming. Also with the Apple TV you have the ability to block certain content if from nosy ankle bitters or Tweens. It's a fantastic way to gather the whole family for movie night without the hassle of driving to Redbox or a video store. Yes, the rentals are a bit higher, but you save time, milage and gas by simply staying at home.Now with the new update Apple offers more channels than ever. Channels I actually like & will watch. Disney, The Weather Channel, Sky News, HBO Go, Smithsonian, You Tube, and more. I cut the cable cord and honestly can't say I miss it. The monthly subscriptions to Netflix & Hulu Plus cost me less than twenty dollars a month. My dishnet work bill ran about 150 a month.

I'm currently running the Apple TV through a Pioneer AV receiver and a Samsung 65\" LED TV.  I couldn't be happier with the Apple TV's picture quality.  The sound quality is also superior, but it is limited to a 5.1 output.Without cable, I'm using an off-air antenna to provide local channels and supplementing with Netflix and iTunes through the Apple TV.  I'm thinking about adding Hulu Plus as well.  I've used the built-in apps in my Samsung TV and a PS3 to stream Netflix before.  While I had good results using the PS3, I prefer to use the Apple TV.  The Apple TV also allows me to access iTunes, which is great for shows which are not on Netflix.  I'll gladly pay $40 for a season of a show that I want to watch vs paying $80+ every month to the cable company.When using iTunes, the picture is a full 1080p.  The streaming is very smooth and it takes almost no time to buffer.  My internet connection is through AT&T; U-Verse and is 18MBPS.I also subscribe to iTunes match, which allows me to play all of my music through the receiver which is hooked up to the Apple TV.  It also runs very smoothly and is fully controllable from my iPhone or iPad.  Additionally, I often stream Pandora from my iPhone via AirPlay through the Apple TV.  The Apple TV even displays the album cover art when listening to Pandora in this fashion.Overall, I'd say it's an excellent replacement for cable.  The setup was easy (HDMI cable hookup and the software walks you through getting it connected to your WiFi).Pros - Excellent quality picture and sound, full access to the Apple universe, streams/mirrors iPhone, iPod, and iPad, easy setup, great Netflix interface.Cons - Limited to 5.1 surround sound, can't download apps (as of yet).", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Issues", "Author": "robert", "ReviewID": "R2DS30BCFBAX4P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Not easy for streaming videos.

It was slick but had a very limited range and was effectively useless in our wireless setup. We switched to a dual band ROKU 2 XS and had improved results.  The ROKU was not that reliable, however.  It frequently dropped signal and most of the time played back in a format well below HD.  The device does not tell you the bandwidth directly but provides a range of one to four dots with all four being HD.  We almost never never got four dots. Most of the time we got three dots, sometimes 2 or even 1.  Still, it worked.We bought the new Apple not expecting any improvement in signal or resolution but merely to watch shows on HBO GO.  It turns out that the suits at ROKU, DirecTV (our service provider), and HBO could not agree terms to stream HBO GO.  So, we were able to watch HBO GO on ipods and pads and computers but we could not watch it over the ROKU on our TV (figuring this out by the way took forever; its a fact that all of the parties involved seem to want to keep well hidden).  Needless to say this was frustrating since we were paying for the service through the HBO subscription.Anyway, the new Apple TV was an unexpected delight in every way. The signal streams in HD almost all of the time.  It is fast, way faster than the ROKU, and you can rewind and pause without dropping the stream - a common event with the ROKU.  It is simply a much more powerful device than the ROKU. Build quality is typical Apple but at the high end of what they do.  It is a solid, heavy and robust feeling piece of gear.  Compared to the Apple the ROKU feels light and cheap. The milled aluminium remote is a delight to use and is far nicer than ROKU's remote which is really quite nice itself.  Presentation is sleek and navigation and setup are a breeze.  The exception is accessing a computer library through the network.  It doesn't bother me because I have a dedicated stereo and have no desire to listen to music through the relatively poor Sonos speakers attached to the TV.  Others may disagree.All of this was totally unexpected.  I had anticipated range problems and was hoping that APple had stepped up and fixed the issue.  They had.  I am not an Apple fan generally but on this piece of kit I think they knocked it out of the park.  On a functional, aesthetic, and build quality basis I would expect this to be $300 - $400 piece of gear.  Either ROKU is reaping huge profits or Apple is taking a hit to position itself for the full blown Apple TV ecosystem rumored to be in the pipeline.  I think the latter.  For $99 this is an incredible deal.  To say that an Apple product is underpriced is even more incredible but, however strange, its true here.I have to give this five stars on all counts with the obvious caveat that it would be nice to access one's Amazon library from Apple.

I am heavily invested in \"iDevices\" in my household - iPhones, iPads, and iTouch music players.  I have my iTunes library that controls all the devices tied to my main PC that is in the office of my house.  I use iTunes as my digital entertainment hub for all of my devices.  iTunes has all of our music, music videos, and digital movies (including digital copies that come with my blu-ray movies that I buy).  I was looking for a way to take all of that digital media and play it in the family room where the home theater is set up.  I chose the Apple TV device.This box is about 3\" x 3\" x1\" and is barely noticable.  Hookup is very simple - power cable, and HDMI cable to the receiver (or directly to TV).  Setting it up takes all of 10 minutes.  It can be connected to your network using a wired connection or wireless.  I use wireless in my house, so I had to set up the wireless on the Apple TV.  Once the Apple TV is connected to the internet, you will put your Apple ID and password in.  Everything you have purchased from Apple is now right there at your fingertips.  I also wanted to tie this device to my media collection that is stored on my PC in the office.  This requires you to turn on Apple's Home Sharing option.  Once you turn that on, the Apple TV will find your media library in iTunes, and make it available.There a few pre-seeded apps on the device (Netflix, HBO 2 Go, You Tube, etc.), plus access to all of the content you have in the Apple ecosystem.  Everything is simple to operate, the user interface is easy to understand, and if you have an HD TV, the quality of video is excellent.Again, I would recommend this to anyone that has a lot invested in Apple content and products.  Since this is a direct competitor to the Roku, Boxee, etc., the form factor of this is very similar to the others.  The only difference between these boxes is user interface and media options - for instance, a Roku box will not play anything you have controlled through Apple's iTunes, and vice versa.  Bottom line, this is made for people invested in Apple for their digital music, digital TV, and digital movies.  If you get your music from Amazon, use Prime Instant Movies, or buy music from Google play, this box will not work for you.

So I should be able to compare them. I purchased Apple TV, because I wanted to be able to use it io view my iPad, and the Roku does not have A Youtube channel. I find myself mainly using the Roku, but probably because I cant have Hulu on both devices.Even though I like checking the Roku app store, I rarely watch anything that Apple TV does not have. The Apple works smoothly, and was easy to set up. I have not had enough time with the Sony TV to comment, but I bought the Sony because it has Google chrome, and Google TV! which might be less expensive for renting, or buying titles. Since the Sony has so many options, and channels, and apps, if it works smoothly it might completely replace the functionality of the Roku, but not the Apple.  The one thing about Roku 3 is that you have the headphone jack on the remote. So I am finding that all three devices are great, I don't have cable TV so I have gone wild with these things. If you are an Apple person you should get one. If you don't have a Mac or iPad, it is great, but you might want to wait until the verdict is out on the Sony, or the Roku 3 for a less expensive, yet robust, mature experience, Or if you are saving a bundle, not paying for a landline and cable etc., then if the Sony turns out as good as the price, get both the Apple TV, and the Sony w Google TV.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!!", "Author": "Skleathers", "ReviewID": "R25DDOIVP7E90G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have canceled my cable since I got this...

I decided to pick one up anyway just to replace my composite video cable adapter that was busted.  That cable costs around $40-$50 and I was able to get the Apple TV for $75.  So instead of hooking a cable from my iPad to the TV, I transfer the video/picture/audio to my TV via the Apple TV and the Airplay function.  When I bring up my video on the iPad, a rectangle with a triangle under it shows up.  If you click on that, my Apple TV shows up and I select it.  When I hit play, the video is transferred via the wireless router in my house to the Apple TV and from the Apple TV to my TV.  As a wireless extension to my iPad, Apple TV seems to work well.  That's worth a solid 3 stars.However, the Apple TV has pretensions of being a multimedia player.  At that, it fails miserably unless your primary source of video and music is from iTunes, Netflix, or Hulu+.  Quite a few folks have raved about the Apple TV menu.  The reason it is reasonably clean is due to the lack of options.  You cannot watch any of your own content unless you have purchased it from iTunes or have it reside on your computer iTunes account.  I knew about this limitation before purchasing this box but I was still shocked with the lack of functionality.  One nice feature is the ability to display your Photo Stream from your Apple iCloud account on your TV as a screen saver.  All in all, I give Apple TV perhaps 1/2 a star on the Photo Stream support but nothing else.So if you are looking to extend your iPad/iPhone/iPod to you TV without wires, this is a nice box (though you need to have a wireless network in your house for it to operate).  If you don't need that wireless extension, don't pick up this box unless you are a big iTunes user.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Used to love it", "Author": "Perry", "ReviewID": "RSM5TG6UONFNX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I used to love the Apple TV for one reason, early movie releases.  I could buy movies sometimes as much as two weeks earlier than the physical version and while I didn't buy many, I could rent others.With Apple TV you have a very simple device that pretty much plays movies, music, YouTube videos, Netflix, and TV shows.  Yes this is cool and the interface just works but, it is seriously lagging behind other devices in the market.  For instance, my Google TV has Hulu Plus, Netflix, Play Movies, Crackle, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Flixster, Vudu, Amazon MP3, Pandora, slacker, play music, and a whole host of other options as well as the ability to manage my whole entertainment experience.The first problem is obviously, flexibility and other devices with Google TV or Roku boxes have way better options available to them.  The second issue is that Loyalty isn't rewarded with Apple!  You see, Apple feels that their exclusive product is worth more for rentals over shorter periods of time than the competition.  Both Amazon and Google deliver their rentals at lower prices and Amazon actually gives you twice as long to watch the movie.So, I honestly have to say that you should pass up the Apple TV until Apple gets their head out of their sphincter!  Mine is sitting here where I cannot sell it because I have too many movies that I stream with it (About 30) but, I won't give them any more of my money until they start Rewarding Loyalty instead of Taxing It!", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why did I wait so long?", "Author": "John L Rumler", "ReviewID": "R3UBLB5RAYNUSX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I finally made the leap and purchased an Apple TV unit.

None worked very well, although Plex seemed to be the closest to what I was looking for.  But it just wasn't able to handle the HD MKVs and it was driving me crazy, so I just grabbed an AppleTV and spent a weekend converting all of my movies in handbrake.  Handbrake is free and easy to use and once you get the movies into a format that you can add to iTunes streaming to the AppleTV works flawlessly.  I thought having all of my movies and TV shows in iTunes would be a pain but it's actually pretty convenient letting iTunes do all the organizing.  However if you're using Windows and don't have a great PC then iTunes may very well be a deal-breaker.

Very few drops or buffering issues when streaming.Second, I love the features it has in regard to itunes - once you sync it with your itunes account, any movies, music, or photos you have on your computer can be streamed onto your TV with your Apple TV.  It also has a screen-saver feature which will \"slide show\" any picture collection you want to show up on your TV screen.  It also gives you multiple ways to present those photos in your screen-saver mode.You can also set up music files through itunes to play through you TV.  Very nice for dinner parties, holiday season, or just want to have music going on in your house while you do chores or whatever.It will only work for one TV so you will have to have an Apple TV for each television you want to stream on.  It does stream Netflix and Hulu Plus, but not Amazon.

Compared to the Streaming BluRay (we had an LG and now have a Panasonic), the Apple TV starts much faster, has better and faster menu system, which delivers a more pleasant streaming experience.  Purchased shows from iTunes are about the same price as Cable VOD, but better quality.One trick worth mentioning--When we facetime my daughter, I mirror the image from my iPhone to the TV screen, place the phone on top of a speaker just under the screen, and two of us talk to my daughter on the big screen.  Works great, and its much more pleasant that trying to pass the phone back and forth or cram into the picture.We use it mostly for sharing pictures, and streaming Netflix.  Its been well worth the money just for the pictures.  We could share pictures on the TV before, but it required more hassle, and we only did it on special occasions.  Last week I took some quick shots and video of a warehouse on fire near my office, and showed them to my wife on the big screen before we watched a TV episode.If you are an apple family, its well worth the $100 to share photos on the TV with incredible ease.

The apple TV allows for access to Netflix and Hulu from the device through an app on there. I also found it was cheaper to just buy some of the seasons I love on iTunes than to have a bigger Dish package just to have that one channel so it has allowed us to save something like 200 dollars a year by looking at what we could buy or rent through iTunes and the channels and shows we currently watch. Hulu has access to tons of shows including the CW. We did have a slight hickup in doing the airplay from my MacBook Pro 2012 with the updated software. The CW website was having serious lag problems when it came to the TV screen. YouTube was also a little lagging from the computer to the TV screen through AirPlay. That is before I found the part where there's a YouTube app on the apple TV so you can simply search and show stuff through the device itself. I highly recommend looking at YouTube for people showing the device before you buy just so you know what it can do.In order to do AirPlay we did have to upgrade out software on our Macbook Pro 2012 but our \"New\" iPad's are already compatable and do the AirPlay brilliantly. One other addition when the iPad was hooked up the \"shown screen\" or the picture we were getting on the TV screen was smaller than the computer and when we just used the product itself. We have a wide screen TV. So it shrunk our TV quite a bit. You do have to pay for Netflix and Hulu if you want to use the services. Also I'll add in how the iTunes works. All your purchases are on there and accessible, but if you buy a season pass the show will show up one day later to be able to view. For example, my guilty pleasure Beverly Hill Housewives show's on the television on Monday's but I can't watch the show through iTunes until Tuesday. I think it's Tuesday at like midnight or early in the morning but it's always the next day even for American Horror Story.

As an Apple heavy household (MacBook Pro, iPad, iPhone, and two Apple AirPort Routers, etc) being able to mirror those devices onto he Apple TV was very appealing. It is wonderful and was easy to set up. For other Apple households I highly recommend it. It may be somewhat less interesting for PC homes, especially if without any iOS devices.But the following is why I'm writing this review:I just bought a refurbished Apple TV from Apple last weekend. I had a hiccup getting Photo Stream to work and called Apple Tech Support. Along with their world class tech support from the Canadian tech I spoke with (we solved the issue quite quickly), she told me something that is not well known. If you buy AppleCare for your Apple TV, the coverage extends to any AirPort Extreme or AirPort Express routers you may have, as long as they are less than two years old. (Of course all Apple products have 90 tech support from date of purchase.)AppleCare, for some reason, isn't available for the routers on their own, but being able to get it via Apple TV was wonderful news. For $29.99 (list price) you can ensure you get two years of tech support for any networking issues you may develop. Since a one time tech call for products out of tech coverage is also $29.99, why not cover all your bases at the start, and for as many issues that arise?My original AirPort Extreme router was over four years old, so I decided to upgrade to the newest dual band version a couple of days ago.  Although I did call tech support to walk me through the set up, it couldn't have been simpler with the AirPort Utility App that is included in Lion and Mountain Lion as well as on iOS 6 devices (iPhone and iPad, for example). Again I received world class service. Last night it turned out I needed to fine tune one setting, and the Canadian tech I spoke to also suggested investing in AppleCare for the Apple TV for the reasons I've just given, and I have done so.This \"wrap around\" coverage to the routers also come from Apple iMacs, MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and iOS devices. For some reason this isn't commonly known, but it should be.  Networking issues can crop up, and having someone troubleshoot them for you can be very expensive. They also drive me crazy with frustration and knowing I have Apple to lean on is a huge relief. Their support is incomparable and North American-based. Every time I've ever had to call (and not many that) I am more impressed by their level of training, their patience and good will.

My only grips about the product might be the streaming speed. The old Apple TV had a hard drive where the rented iTunes movie would download directly and play - this has a flash memory that temporarily stores the movie for playback... if you start an HD movie then stop it so you can finish up the movie later, you seem to have to wait for the buffer to start the download again (like it never fully downloaded the movie the first time.

AirPlay from my kids ipods, and ipad, also proved to be a very nice feature. Hopefully with the coming OS upgrade, ATV might have some Apps capabilities coming into it soon.My internet connection is supposed to be 10 Mbps, and it measures up to 8-10 Mbps most of the time, and with that speed, I get good video and sound quality, without noticeable stuttering or long buffering times, so I'm satisfied with it.Amazon delivered on time, with super-saving free shipping, and the purchase price itself both times was marginally lower than Apple's official list price, so it proved to be a good deal for me.

When running on the same network you are able to use \"Airplay\" to mirror your device onto your TV quite seamlessly and without wires.  Want to play your tunes on the nice speakers while you clean?  Easy.  Share your vacation pictures on the big screen with no fuss?  Simple.  You can even play games with the big screen, however depending on your network speed there is about a half second delay.I can't count how many times the music in our house has been pumped through the Apple TV.  Our TV system has the best speakers so it makes sense.Want to entertain the kiddos?  Airplay your ipad/iphone and turn on the video camera and let the kids have fun seeing themselves on TV.  Trust me, this entertains kids for quite some time.For the price, its a no-brainer.

I recently purchased this Apple TV because I want to mirror my Mac Air and iPad screen to the Sony Brevia TV (no wifi function).  So, after comparing these two products, here is my observation.Sony Blue-ray has many more channels by 10 times compares to Apple TV, including the unpaid/no-need-for-subscription Crackle (ad. occurs every 15 mins).  Also, if you have Amazon Prime, you can watch Amazon Instant Movie on Blue-ray, but not on Apple TV.  The only movie channels on Apple are iTune and Netflix.  If you like TV shows, Apple TV also has Hulu Plus that costs just as much as Netflix online streaming.  But that is pretty much it for Apple TV.One huge advantage of having an Apple TV is that you can actually use keyboard to enter the name of the youtube video or name of the movie/TV shows or whatever.  If you own a bluetooth Apple keyboard, then you can easily connect it to your Apple TV (it is a no brainer, super easy to do).  Don't underestimate this feature, because a lot of people, including myself, have already given up on searching videos on YouTube or Netflix using a Blue-ray, because it is a pain in the neck to use remote control to enter each letter of the keyword or song/movie/video title.If you have subscribed to Netflix and have high-speed internet at home (download speed is greater than 10mbps), then Apple TV gives you super HD quality picture (1080) when you watch a movie.  The blue-ray I own is visibly not as great as Apple TV when it comes to HD movies on Netflix.  However, if your internet is slow when you use Apple TV, then multiple problems occur when you watch HD movies, including in-synchronization between audio and video, video stops frequently and screen turns black, video lags and so on.  One solution might be to use ethernet cable instead of wifi.The set-up for Apple TV is easy - all you need is a HDMI cable (purchase separately) and a TV that has HDMI input.  The mirroring function of your iPad/Macbook/iPhone/iPod to your TV can be done in less than a 1 sec.  There is no requirement for set-up.  All  you need to do is to connect the Apple TV to your TV and power, and the icon for mirroring function will automatically shows up on your other Apple devices.  I've had a lot of fun with the mirroring function with my cat, he truly believes now that there is a huge rat lives behind the TV screen because I played a lot of rat videos on my huge Sony TV through mirroring function via my Mac Air.If you have a PC and no Mac, then there is no question about it that you should choose anything but Apple TV.  I have a Windows 7 PC laptop, and I can stream movies to my Sony Blue-ray through the windows media sharing client function.  However, it does take a bit of effort and time to set up.  Not nearly as easy as Apple TV Home Sharing.  So, if you have a Mac and you want to stream movies or videos, then your best bet is Apple TV.  However, if you have a PC and want to stream videos, then you must use Blue-ray or other Windows compatible devices, unless you have purchase movies directly on iTune, then it is ok.Finally, Apple TV does not take blue-ray disk or any other DVD.  Also, to my surprise, if you try to play DVD through Airplay, it won't work either.  So, if you play DVD every now and then, then Blue-Ray is your best bet.After testing out both the blue-ray and Apple TV, I think these two devices aim at different population and they do several different things as mentioned above.

The remote Apple likes to rely on style but it has exceeded itself this time Blending Style and being cheap have created a tiny  unwelcome easy to loose remote for the Device. The buttons are recessed into a thin aluminum rectangular remote that fits a child's hand better than an adults.2.

The remote is simply better it has earphone Jacks that allow you to watch T.V. without disturbing others.2.

A B movie from 1985 should not cost $4.99.  A good example is \"re-animator\".  Some use the excuse of \"well it's just convienent to rent from home blah blah\".  Say what you want, but the prices are TOO high and keep customers like myself from renting.  Here is a tip to apple:  If you rent movies at .99 cents(older movies) and I rent 5 a week, that's $4.95.  Now if you keep the prices of those same movies at $4.99 EACH, I personally will not rent anything.  I am also betting a LOT of other customers don't rent because of the same issue.  So you either keep prices the way they are and get ZERO or lower them and get more rentals.  Why would I \"buy\" a movie on there?  Its not a tangible object like real blueray or DVDs.- Netflix - even though it's a separate company, they are attached in apple tv.  I spent over 3 months last year trying to resolve a buffering issue with them.  My cable company pointed the finger at Netflix and vice versa.  Some changes were finally made(they never told me what) and it got better.  BUT..... If I play Netflix from my iPad or Mac, I never get buffer issues.  This lead me to believe the apple tv was giving problems.-  HDCP error -  boy this is annoying.  You go to watch a movie and 4 seconds later it freezes.  A minute later the infamous \"HDCP\" error pops up which makes you reboot apple tv.  I have followed all the suggestions to resolve the issue and still get this error about 2-3 times a week.- TV shows on apple tv - $2.99 a episode?  Yep you read that right, they are $2.99 for ONE 47 minute episode.  I cancelled my cable tv in June 2011 and got a antenna. Now I get 24 HD channels for free.  I don't get discovery channel, or AMC but the savings alone make up for it(was paying $165 a month for cable & Internet), now it's down to $60).- I tunes festival - I'm not sure how that option showed up because it just appeared one day without updates.  Kinda boring.- Hulu plus -  if you have a Netflix subscription, don't bother with Hulu.  Netflix(dare I say it) has a better selection.  We tried Hulu for 4 days and most of the selections were boring or not worth watching.  There was also a HUGE selection of Korean movies.  I personally don't speak Korean, so they are worthless to me.- YouTube is what it is.... Plays videos from YT.- the other options are really boring unless your into basketball or hockey.  And even then, you have to have subscriptions to both.  Can we say nickel and diming here......With the way companies break everything up and \"give you more options\" these days, what it really means is \"we are going to charge everything we can for EACH item\".  Again, see my \"nickel and diming\" comment above.My wife and I are currently looking for a Internet ready TV so we can get rid of the apple TV box.  It's quite sad because we moved ALL of our computers(4 total) from PC to Mac in mid 2010.  Being really happy with the move, we figured apple tv would be awesome.

Their video rental selection is top-notch, you usually get iTunes digital copies with the Blu-ray combo packs you can buy, a good (not great) selection of TV shows are available, there's tons of great free content (news, vlogs, etc.) via Video Podcasts and Apple's developed a way to stream what's on your iPad 2/3 or iPhone 4S screen to an Apple TV via a technology called \"AirPlay\".I personally have around 100 iTunes movies and it's great to be able to sync them to my iPhone/iPad for my kids to watch when we're out and about, then come home and stream them to my TV with a push of a button.As you'd expect with Apple, the interface is top-tier. Sure every Blu-ray player and game system out there nowadays has YouTube, but usually the interfaces are clunky enough that you rarely use the feature. Apple TV's Netflix interface is also my favorite of the plethora of streaming devices I tried!If you have a lot of iTunes video, a Netflix subscription, rent a lot of movies (but hate driving or waiting for the mail), or watch any Video Podcasts, it's surely worth dropping $99 on this puppy.However, it's not perfect. First, while this is the first \"1080p\" Apple TV, you shouldn't expect Blu-ray quality (as is the case with any current media streamer). Blu-rays pump out up to 40 Mbps of data to your TV, while Apple suggests you have an 8Mbps connection for their \"1080p\" content. Thus, while the resolution is technically full HD, movies have to be so compressed that they lose a bit of color depth and sound quality in order to make streaming over the internet practical: in short, this device is about convenience more than quality.Also, while Apple TV supports a lot of content that no other media streamer can (iTunes video in particular), there are some services notably absent from the selection. For example, there's no Hulu+ and no way to download it since the Apple TV has no App Store.The good news is that you can partially overcome this limitation with the video mirroring \"AirPlay\" feature of iPad 2/3 or iPhone 4S. The bad news with these devices is that the experience is suboptimal. Using Hulu+ as the example, the first thing you'll notice is that the aspect ratio of the iPad and an HDTV is different, so you get black bars on the sides. The picture is also relatively low quality, but it does the job.Nevertheless, since a lot of Blu-ray players offer Hulu+ and even apps, it puts the Apple TV at somewhat of a functional disadvantage in some respects.However, even with its limitations the reality remains that Apple TV is my go-to device for Netflix, YouTube, movie rentals, iTunes streaming, video podcasts and even Flickr slideshows of family photos.

Jackson", "ReviewID": "R2B2ZF2WOWZT3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The more I use this the more I love it. I am an owner of Roku boxes, the original Boxee Box, as well as the other common streaming options like a PS3, Smart TV, and Blu-Ray player.  Of all of the devices in our house the only one my wife uses is the Apple TV. I would say simplicity as well as reliability are the biggest reasons why she prefers it to the others.There are little things that I love about Apple TV that put it ahead of the competition. Let's start with the Apps first.  Apple TV has a very different interface for services like Hulu Plus and Netflix and it is in my opinion a superior one. Roku's Netflix App, for example, makes you scroll left to right with just a few titles in your instant queue showing each time. Apple TV shows all of your instant queue titles in one large screen. It is much easier to scroll down and find titles in the middle or bottom of a large queue.  Because of this different user interface all of the screens in the apps are easier to use and navigate.I also like that when you pick a something to watch it suggests several other titles that are similar to the one that you picked. This is very helpful in unlocking lesser known titles in the Netflix library.  Most apps do not come close to showing you all of the titles that are available for Netflix streaming. The suggestions open up the options to things you did not know were there. I love this feature as I have discovered titles that never show up in the main browsing menus.The other big plus is that the Apple TV always works. I cannot say this has been the case with the other boxes I own. I have lost track of the number of times I have had to reboot my Roku or Boxee Box to clear up a problem. This is more of an issue with Boxee but my Roku will often restart itself, lock-up in an app, or just be very slow in general navigation. I do not remember the last time I had to unplug the Apple TV for a hard reboot, if ever.I also love being able to push the up or down button on the remote to see where I am at in the program without having to press pause. I miss this function a lot on my Roku boxes. In addition to your place in the program this bar is useful when you are streaming Itunes related content. Apple TV has 8GB of internal flash storage and begins downloading an Itunes title when you start watching it.  This means you will not see a drop in image quality while watching a program even if your bandwidth becomes less. The progress bar shows you how much of the title is downloaded with a white bar.  If you are having streaming issues just pause the title and wait for the white bar to go ahead of your pause point. It is pretty rare when I need to do this but it is good to be able to see how much of the content is downloaded. If you do not finish a title and come back to it later the downloaded portion stays on the flash storage so streaming is always smooth.Of all the positives mentioned above I have not gotten into Air Play functions.  If you own an Ipad or Iphone, like my wife and I do, then this is another awesome feature. Simply put there are other options that offer more content but there are not many that do it in such simplistic and reliable fashion as this. If you own any other Apple products like a Macbook, Iphone, or Ipad then getting this little box would be a great choice. Even if you are not an Apple user there is a lot to love about Apple TV.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple TV Packaging/Set-Up", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "RTANC300WW1SD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In the box you get the Apple TV, which is a small black box measuring only 23mm x 98mm x 98mm that weighs just 0.27kg, a nice-looking aluminum remote with very few buttons, some setup instructions and a power lead. The Apple TV has exactly the same ports and connectors on the back as before. There's an ethernet port, an Optical Audio port and a HDMI port for connection to your TV. You'll also notice a Micro-USB port, but this has no use for the home user - it's just for Apple's Geniuses to use when diagnosing problems. The Apple TV processor has been upgraded to the A5 chip to cope with 1080p HD movie playback. iFixit has done a teardown on the Apple TV and found that the Broadcom 4330 Wi-Fi chip inside also supports Bluetooth 4.0+HS, although it currently makes no use of this technology - it's possible that the functionality could be added in a future update. The current Apple Remote uses Infrared, this requires line of site to your Apple TV, which can be a pain - a Bluetooth remote would be far superior.Connection to your TV is via a HDMI cable, but be aware that there isn't one in the box, so you have to purchase that separately.The first surprise with the new Apple TV compared to the previous generation is that once you connect it up to your TV is that it talks to you! A voice asks you if you'd like to enable the Voice Over feature by clicking a button on the remote three times.Voice Over reads out what the menu option you've currently got selected is, so it will be a very useful feature for visually impaired users who need extra help navigating the menu systems.Proceeding on, you set up the usual things like language then select a WiFi network - if you've never done this before then it will be your first encounter with the Apple TV's tedious way of entering text and numbers - you have an alphabetically ordered block of letters that you have to have to slowly manoeuvre around using the remote's click wheel. t's frustrating to use because the layout is so unfamiliar - having the letters arranged like a computer keyboard would have been more intuitive.Going through the process of painfully entering your WiFi password one character at a time using this input method only to realise you got one of the characters wrong and have to do it all over again is heartbreaking, especially when at this stage you just want to get on with enjoying all the great content your Apple TV promises.

I've since upped to 3/5.The good:+Easy to setup.+Airplay from OSX works great.  Super easy to get set up.  I don't have an iPhone so can't tell you how well it works from your phone, but imagine it's just as easy.+If you can play it in iTunes, you can easily stream it to your TV.+The remote is nice.The bad:-If you can play it in iTunes, you can easily stream it to your TV.  Yes I did list it as both good and bad.  The problem is that iTunes doesn't support really that many file formats.Want to play a video in MKV file?  It's a popular video format, but nope sorry.Want to play a FLAC?  It's open source and more popular than Apple's lossless format, but nope sorry.It makes for a really crappy user experience when you have to convert formats for the sake of Apple's prudness.  Converting audio is not that big of a deal.  However re-encode HD video in to an mp4, can take considerable time.  Although I've figured out how to encode the video to mp4, and the even faster method of remuxing the video (assuming it's using the proper encoding), it's still more time (and possibly cost) than the non-technical will want to put in to it.  Sometimes the Apple way, is not the best way.-The lack of apps.  It would seem that this is a killer time for Apple to dominate the living room.  However they haven't opened up the Apple TV up to developers, so don't expect to find specialty music apps like Pandora.  However you could always play such services via Airplay either on OSX or iOS.-Does not recognize different wireless frequencies with the same broadcast name.  I've always found this kind of odd, and it's the same way in OSX.  If you want to chose between 2.4 Ghz or 5 Ghz wireless you must name each differently.  If you're going to steam high def video, or use airplay to your tv you probably want the 5 Ghz band properly set up.-The interface feels old and dated.-Not all Macs or Hackintoshs support Airplay video mirroring.  Luckily an app like AirParrot will allow you to use it.  Airplay sound should work regardless.Conclusion:Overall it's a stylish little box, and you could probably do worse.  If you're happy with iTunes, and can deal with how Apple restricts you, or already have your entire media library in iTunes, then this is right up your alley and you'll love this.  If you buy content from the iTunes store and want a way to play it on your tv easily, you'll love this.  If you have an iOS device and can Airplay stuff to it, you'll love this.  If you're just a huge fanboy, you'll love this.For the rest the lack of choice seems less than ideal.  If you have a large media library that is not iTunes friendly you should spend your money else where.  Similar boxes, like the Roku 3 (but any Roku 2 box really) have a lot more apps, and can play nearly any music or video format with Plex media server.  A lot more choice and cost the same or less.  The Roku 3 should also soon support the non-Apple Airplay called \"Miracast\".After using the Apple TV it for a few days, I'm probably going to keep it.  I find enough uses for it, and have invested enough time in to it to figure out some of the technical hurdles.  I do enjoy Airplay, but wonder if it's really worth the cost of admission.  However that seems to be what this device is, it was meant for you to use some kind of other Apple device to interact with it.  It just, feels odd.  But when you think about it, it should bring unlimited possibilities.I find it hard to recommend.  I feel it's primarily aimed at non-technical people who don't know any better, like most Apple products.  However if you are on the more technical side and have the patience to deal with the technical issues it can also serve you well.

The advantage of AmazonPrime is the free content, i.e., Downton Abbey seasons 1 & 2 are free on Amazon Prime, but you have to purchase them on AppleTV. We also have Comcast Xfinity and get free programming that we would have to pay for on the AppleTV, i.e., Homeland TV series.  I think AppleTV would be a better product if it included AmazonPrime, but I'm happy with it.

For me and the family it was mainly about watching movies and some educational documentaries a few times per week through iTunes and Netflix. Being that we're also a Mac and iOS family with numerous Macs and iOS devices around the house, the ATV became more useful than just streaming movies and shows to the HDTV set. Now with iCloud it's the wireless router that brings all of the content available through the Mac and iOS ecosystem to the TV screen and the home theater audio system. Gone are the big unsightly black boxes and cables that cluttered the TV cabinet along with the racks of CDs and DVDs. With all the content on iTunes Match and the iOS devices, it's just a matter of using the remote or the iDevices themselves to control what you watch and listen to through the ATV.The value of the ATV is that much greater if you have already invested in the Apple ecosystem - Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPod touch, iTunes content, etc. The ATV on its own, I gather, isn't all that great compared to what's already out there. For TV freaks who put in 4~5 hours of TV time per day, I'd imagine there are more thorough and feature-rich devices out there. But as an extension device of all things Apple to the TV screen, this little unit works charmingly well and provides more than enough content for the casual TV watcher and movie fan. I'd only really recommend this unit to iOS device owners and there are plenty of them out there.Apple still has ways to go to make the TV an integral part of its growing ecosystem. One can tell that Apple is getting more and more serious about this business and that it isn't just a \"hobby\" anymore. These little ATV boxes seem more like a real-world R&D; testing for Apple's rumored HDTV set that could arrive near the end of this year or sometime in 2013. The key will be content and Apple still has a lot of work to do on that front. For me, live sports would be the only thing I'd consider to be essential to make it perfect but I know most other people have other wants and needs when it comes to what they want to watch. In the meantime, this new ATV would be a great addition to iPhone/iPad owners and a reasonable add-on for others who want to stream movies and archived TV shows every now and then.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "all excellent", "Author": "cahern4", "ReviewID": "R2QLH3BHS9CEB8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "all excellent, as expected, excellent quality, easy to install, easy to user;, I am very happy with the item and my Iphone I can now connect to my TV", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Author": "Ana12345", "ReviewID": "R3TLCH9DEDT9ST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cannot tell you how nice it is to see my iPad mirrored on my Apple TV.

I was really trying to decide what to say when writing this review but, this product tells everything it self. Like at this moment, I was trying to decide if I wanted the new xbox one or the PS4. Then, I thought, I have an Apple TV that is just amazing. It runs fast, no delays, very responsive. Remote is very little, not another big remote that usually comes with a tv or cable box. Netflix is in HD, everything is in HD. It had a recent update that made it even better. Has numerous of apps. Netflix, HULU Plus, WWE TV, NBA TV, ABC TV, HBO GO and Crackle. I can go on and on about everything the APPLE TV has but, back to what I was saying. Xbox one, has all the entertainment features and gaming. Why pay an extra $100 for a product, that I had already paid $100 for that does everything that I need entertainment wise. So, I decided I'm going to eventually get the PS4. Now, enough about my xbox one or ps4 decision. The product is great. It's small, almost to the point that it's about as long as a credit card for it's width and height and the depth of it, is easily only about 3 inches. It won't take much room at all. The remote is small and is great. The added feature though, is if you're like myself and own numerous apple products already. The Apple TV let's you airplay anything that you see on your phone to your tv including pictures, videos, music, apps, messages. Anything. The other cool thing abut this product that I love so much is the fact that you can get the remote app for free in the apple store on your iPhone and use your iPhone as a remote for it. Instead of dealing with an extra remote, you can just leave the remote app running and always have your remote and it's free of buttons, so you just roll your fingers anywhere you want your apple tv to go when selected a product. That concludes why I love this product and why I give it a 5 out of 5 star rating.

I use both of them and like them equally. I use different apps on each, so I and my housemate can keep our places in different apps. Since I might only watch for 10 minutes at a time, I don\u2019t want to spend time opening an app and finding my place in a show.I did set up Plex for Roku, but I way prefer streaming from my iPad or iPhone to Apple TV. Its so much easier to search on the iPhone or iPad, for streaming YouTube, movie trailers, music or videos. Also any friend or housemate in the house with an iPhone can stream to the Apple TV. Besides, there is a fun element of seeing your little devise stream to a big TV.I just checked and I could stream a movie from my iPad Amazon Prime app to Apple TV. It DID go full screen just as YouTube videos do. I couldn't tell on resolution. It looked the same to me when I went back to the Amazon app on the Roku and looked at the same movie clip. I can't swear to it though. If you intend to get the Apple TV and stream Amazon Prime, than I would check reviews on resolution or call Apple. I also don't know what would happen with various iPhones. I believe the resolution went up to at least TV resolution on the recent devises. I would say you DO want HD though if you have a big TV. From Amazon's end of things, I believe Amazon streams to the iPad or iPhone in HD. Last I read some months ago Amazon does not stream movies in HD to computers even if you paid for HD. As long as that is the case, in my mind that might knock Apple TV out of the running for streaming Amazon from a mac to Apple TV. The other issue would be bandwidth.  I am told by Apple tech help that when you stream from a computer or devise to your Apple TV, you are using double the bandwidth.  I have fiber to the home so I haven't noticed any slowing down.As for usability of the devises, I enjoy both Apple TV and Roku. They both handle well, and are quick enough, and both are user friendly.With Apple TV just make sure you pair your remote with the Apple TV.  I didn't know that mine wasn't paired, because the remote was working. But some flaky things were happening in one app which I was blaming on the app. When I called into Apple tech support they showed me how to pair the remote to the TV... phew... that fixed my problems.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome product", "Author": "T.

My logic was that there were some channels that had apps for watching video for which there was no channel on Roku and either didn't use or limited their Hulu selections.  First, let me say trying to use Airplay from an iPad for this purpose was pointless.  The Apple TV was plugged directly into my AC router which also happened to be in the same room as our main TV.  With no other network traffic, the picture was terrible and it stuttered, stopped, and restarted for no reason.  So, I wrote off Airplay.Still, I paid for it so I was hoping I can still use it on a different TV rather than buying another Roku.  To put it bluntly, the channel selection is pathetic for a device that costs the same as a Roku.  Not only is there no Amazon Prime, there are not just a lot of other channels either.  I've given up on cable/dish, so having as many channels as possible without having to hookup my laptop to the TV is essential.  Here the Apple TV falls very, very short.The user interface is nice and smooth and I actually prefer it slightly over Roku.  The lack of channels is just too big of a drawback for me to overcome.

No, it's not your cheapest option, and yes I'd love for them to update the software (perhaps to match with iOS 7), it's really the best option for someone who uses Apple products. The quality is fantastic, it has all the streaming channels you'd want (those that it might not have, you can easily connect from your phone), and it seamlessly integrates with all of my other iDevices (iMac, Airport, iPhone, iPad).There are a couple of things that bother me, but nothing that makes me not want to use it. For example, the YouTube App is kind of frustrating in the Apple TV, but I find it's just as easy to search on my iPhone YouTube App, then just send it to my TV. Similarly, there is no Amazon Instant App, but I do the same: find it on my iPhone and send it to the TV. And yes, I am ready for them to upgrade the software/interface. It's been a while.As for things I LOVE: It's great for parties, in that I can put my iPad out and open, for anyone to access Spotify and have it streaming through my TV and speakers. Before the Apple TV, I would have had to let people use my computer, which is less appealing. Also, if I've got a group of people over and we are sharing YouTube videos, it's easy for the next person to queue up their video and send it to the TV when it's their turn.All in all, it works like it's supposed to, the hallmark of all Apple products, and the Apple TV is no different.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really like it", "Author": "ex-jerseygirl", "ReviewID": "R1OEE7C7JDQ45B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fast, easy setup.

All separate queues.  This is the only device I have (of many) that recognizes that feature.

So why did I buy an apple tv?1.  The simple answer is the mirror feature.  With apple tv I can stream the CBS app on my iphone and have it play through my TV.  Why do you need this?  Well we dumped our cable and CBS shows are only available online or apps.  This is a super easy way to keep current on all our shows.  You can do this with anything else on your iphone or ipad.  I use the iphone because the stream window is almost full TV size where the ipad is minimized.2.  I was blown away by the HD quality.  It puts roku to shame.  My wife, who can't tell the difference between standard def and HD on  Uverse even noticed the difference between the roku and the apple tv.Why didn't you give this a 5 star rating?  2 reasons:1.  You can't watch your amazon prime, though as I write this I haven't tried mirroring from my phone.  C'mon apple, add the app.2.  You can't add any channels. You get what apple gives you.

It does this beautifully, but what I didn't expect was superior performance when streaming from Hulu Plus, Netflix and YouTube. There are a lot of the apps that are also resident on my Vizio TV set, but many that are not, and vice versa, so this also added an expansion of my streaming ability. Set up in a few minutes without a hiccup! Note too, that i am using a PC, not a Mac, and I am not particularly Apple-centric, but I find iTunes to be the best app for compiling and centralizing a music and video library. I can also access my library via my Samsung tablet using Samsung Link and have iTunes open for the Apple TV and other Apple devices without any conflict. Now for those considering getting one of these in order to stream from your personal iTunes library, you can do so without any concern. There are some limitations on video format, but if your primary player is iTunes, and the video plays there, it will play via Apple TV.My audio files in iTunes are loaded as uncompressed .wav files as opposed to using one of Apple's codices. I am an audiophile and many of my files, particularly home recordings from LP, are high resolution at 96kHz 24 bit, as well as the typical 44.1kHz 16 bit CD files. Absolutely no lag or bottleneck to the flow. I am currently piping the audio into a stereo system from the TV set's line out jacks, and the quality is nearly as good as playing the files directly from the computer into the main system it is hardwired into.At first I couldn't locate the proper playlist option, and assumed that the playlists weren't working. Turns out it was a simple matter of selecting the sort option to sort by name and then scroll up and BAM!, there it was. I thought at first too, that it wouldn't automatically play the next video in my iTunes playlist, but again, that was my slip, not the unit.It earns a 5 star rating from me, as it is a simple yet elegant solution to accessing my media library remotely.

Mojica", "ReviewID": "R334XN38GGUI96", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this device for about a month now and thought I'd give some impressions which might aid those considering a purchase.First, on the device itself. It's small in size and works well. I recently cancelled my pay-TV package because it was just too expensive for the amount of time I used it. I had 500 channels and watched about 1 of them. My main viewing interest was in watching NHL hockey games, and I watched nothing else, so why pay for what I wasn't using? NHL games were available through Apple TV for $100 dollars a year\u2014about what I was paying each month for pay-TV. A good deal. I find that I actually get a better picture through the Apple TV than I got through my pay-TV provider, so I'm satisfied with how the device works.Now, what I'm not so satisfied with. First, in the NHL TV package, the games come on when the games begin and end immediately when the games are over. What's the big deal about that? Well, I like to get at least a little pre-game and post-game coverage. I'm not expecting complete pre- or post-game shows, but at least a little something. I don't need the game to switch off the second the final buzzer sounds. This isn't Apple's fault. I'm sure it's in the NHL TV contract. I won't reduce my rating because of this, but it's something to consider for sports fans because I'm sure it's the same deal with the NBA and MLB packages.There is not enough content available from Apple TV. Looking at the list available through Roku, they seem to offer a lot more, and a greater variety. For instance, I'm a subscriber to Amazon Prime. It's not directly availably through Apple TV. I've read here in reviews that you can view Amazon prime videos through Apple TV by mirroring your iPad, but I haven't been able to make this work. Oddly, I've been able to get the sound, but not the picture. I hear the program, but get a blank screen. Maybe I'm dumb, but Apple prides itself on making easy to use & intuitive devices so dumb guys like me don't have to bat our brains out getting the devices to work. Besides YouTube and the NHL games, there is really nothing available on Apple TV that I want. So I take a star off for that.I'm a long time and loyal Apple user, going back to the days of the Powerbook 160, and I like Apple products, but it's a love-hate relationship. Some things about Apple products bug the hell out of me, and a prime example of this is the Apple TV remote.Apple seems to have a design protocol that states that all their products will have a sleek, minimalistic, zen-like design with no bumps, protruding surfaces, seams, buttons or breaks to distract the eye. They want their products to have a certain \"look\" or, as they might call it \"sensory experience\". This may all look very well in a salesroom display, but we customers have to work and deal with these things, and what looks good doesn't always work good.The new model of the iMac is a perfect example of this. They designed a light, sleek (a real Apple word there) razor thin display unit that almost disappears when you look at it from the side. A wonderful technological accomplishment, but Apple doesn't seem to realize that just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD do something. In my work with computers, a DVD-R/optical drive is a necessity. The new iMac, with its sleek chassis, has no room for a DVD-R drive, so if I want to use a DVD-R drive, I have to buy it separately, hook it up to the computer, using up a valuable USB plug, and have it sitting by the computer with cables running all over the desk. Hence we get the sleek, elegant zen design of the iMac with an un-sleek, inelegant dvd-r drive sitting next to it on the desk, with spaghetti like cables running from the drive to the computer. Sort of ruins the sleek, elegant, minimalistic effect, nicht wahr? Dammit, this thing is a DESKTOP computer, not a laptop. It's not something I'm going to carry around in a briefcase. Do I need it to be sleek, razor thin, light, when it's going to be sitting on a desk? The design is eye-catching and you may say, \"wow!\" the first time you see it. The ten thousand times after that, it's just another thing sitting on the desk. Recently when I needed a new desktop computer and discovered all this, it was the closest I've ever come to switching from Apple. I didn't, but I did go out and buy a used, reconditioned 4 year old iMac, which I'm satisfied with.Sorry for wandering off the subject, but I felt a need for an Apple rant. Back to the Apple TV remote. It's another one of those sleek, almost invisible, disappearing designs Apple so loves. But do the Apple designers ever watch TV? Do they ever use a remote control? Do they realize how easy it is to misplace a remote control? Don't they know the frustration of having a remote slip down in the sofa cushions when the user doesn't know it's slipped? Do these people live in the real world, or in a hermetically sealed container constructed completely of sleek, aluminized, elegant zen surfaces colored only in shades of white, black and gray? The Apple TV remote is ridiculously small, ridiculously thin, and just perfect to get lost with the least bit of inattention. It is a thing designed to win design awards, not to be used. So I reduced the rating another star for this.It's a shame, because the Apple TV device is really a nice item. It works well and, as I said, gives a very good picture. But there is a severe lack of interesting viewing content. If that is improved, I will revise this review and bump it up a star. I don't suspect they will ever change the remote device\u2014it goes against their senseless design ethic. Since the remote is such an essential part of this device (it's useless without a remote), and the remote is such an annoying (if elegant) design, this thing will never be a five star item for me.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easzy", "Author": "Christopher c Michaels", "ReviewID": "RVJODEY3JPQ8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came in a box it plugged it and it workedInstructions were there and so was playgirl easy was all I wanted and got ut", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "BlondeAmbition321", "ReviewID": "RVGI1H7JLQTCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Able to watch all kinds of TV, instant access to Netflix, YouTube, Vevo, and so much more.

No native amazon app (need to airplay from another device to use amazon prime instant video).Additional Con:  This one is the fault of the American people NOT the fault of Apple or Amazon.  My streaming ability was immediately degraded by my internet provider the second the supreme court overturned the FCC regulation preventing violations of network neutrality.

I grew tired of increasing cable TV prices and having difficulty finding TV programming that I actually wanted to watch. I truly believe TV media is changing as we know it.  Apple TV and other streaming media devices are leading this change.PROS:- Airplay is awesome.- Did I mention that Airplay is awesome?- No really, Airplay is what sets apart Apple TV from all its competitors and really an amazing feature.  I digress...- I personally enjoy the following options on Apple TV:  YouTube, Apple Radio, iTunes via Airplay, Bloomberg News (surprisingly), Yahoo Screen (for SNL and The Onion), PBS, ESPN and NBA (for game highlights and short news clips) , Crackle, The Weather Channel, VEVO, Podcasts (which I never used before), and the Airplay Mirroring feature (mostly for Basic Hulu).- I can usually find something on Apple TV to occupy my time.  After all,  isn't that what TV is for?  It does take some effort to find something sometimes.  It's not like regular TV where you can just turn it on and all your programming is done for you.INTRIGUING OFFERS IF I FELT LIKE SPENDING MORE MONEY OR BEING MORE TECH SAVY:-Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO GO-iMovie, Photos/Videos, FlickrCONS:- no amazon prime offering (however I think I read you can mirror Amazon Prime with an iOS device)- the remote works well however could be improved with a keyboard feature or headphone jack or sensor technology- no gaming features unless you use an iPad or iPhone with Mirroring- Mirroring did not work well straight out of the box (I had to alter my router settings to get rid of very jerky video playback.  This took me a while to figure out as no Apple representatives were able to help me.  I found the fix on some random messaging board.)- Video playback of HD quality video with mirroring is still slightly jerky.  Let me stress that the playback is only SLIGHTLY jerky.  It's to the point where its hardly noticeable to me.  It does not bother me, but it's not perfect.  My understanding is because it takes a lot of bandwidth to mirror from your device to the Apple TV.  I do not know that there is any way to completely fix this without running a cord.  Video playback used to be flawless using my HD cable. Despite all this, I value being able to mirror with Airplay more than running my HD cable.- not as much channel availability as the ROKU.  I have never used the ROKU, but I've heard that quality ROKU channels are few and far between despite their large channel lineup.WARNING:DON\"T FORGET TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN OPERATING SYSTEM ON YOUR APPLE DEVICE THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE APPLE TV AIRPLAY FEATURE!BOTTOM LINE:If you are an Apple user already, I recommend the Apple TV.  If not, I think the ROKU is a fine option.  Apple TV and ROKU are especially valuable if you wish to \"cut the cord\" to Cable TV.MY TWO CENTS FOR THOSE \"CUTTING THE CORD\":Don't forget to use a quality TV antenna for those days when you cannot find something on your streaming media player.

You can still watch the shows you like via Netflix, HBO Go, ESPN, etc. but without the commercials & without having to wait until a certain time to watch the show. With the Apple TV, you are in control.I like this better than the Roku because the interface is simple & clean. Also, there is a YouTube app which the Roku doesn't have (major mistake on Roku's part). Lastly, the Apple TV syncs well with the iPhone & mac computers so you can show whatever your phone screen is showing on your TV via Apple TV. This is great if you want to watch a game on The Big Ten Network for example & Apple TV doesn't offer it - you can just put it on your phone or computer & beam it to the TV wirelessly. Pretty solid & I don't consider it very laggy, unless you have a slow internet connection.The YouTube interface leaves much to be desired. You can't read comments, etc. but it's still nice for watching videos. You can also download the Apple remote on your iPhone for free.

But everything I've tried so far has been seamless. I haven't tried Netflix or other apps, but i have two other devices that can stream Netflix (TV and Blu-ray), so I'm not worried about that if it doesn't work well. Of course it would be nice if it streamed Amazon, but my two other aforementioned devices do that, too, so this was not a dealbreaker. One hint though, if you have a Mac, the remote will try to operate your computer, too. That was annoying until I figured out how to turn it off (System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Advanced > click Disable remote control infrared receiver). I don't use a remote with a Mac, but I can imagine that if you do, it may annoy you to have to turn this off completely rather than pairing with a specific remote. There may be a workaround for this, not sure.One thing I really like is that I have two options, I can access what's on my computer or iCloud directly from AppleTV (and use the apps), or I can mirror my computer if I want to stream something that's not an AppleTV app, such as Spotify, through AirPlay (this works with Amazon video, too, but you may need to turn off the AppleTV screensaver), though that does require a few extra steps. I originally bought a Roku 3 but found its lack of flexibility annoying and ended up selling it after one week on eBay (besides that, the Netflix interface on Roku was awful compared with my Panasonic Blu-ray). The AppleTV is about 95% what I was looking for. Now, if someone could just replace my Hopper, receiver and Blu-ray with something this petite! BTW,  I have a MacBook Pro running Mavericks. I don't know if AirPlay works with a PC.And P.S., if anyone is wondering why you might want to send something like Spotify to your TV, my TV audio plays through my stereo system, not through the TV speakers. I used to have to plug my computer (or iPod or iPhone) into the stereo receiver through a <gasp> cable.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "These were Christmas Gifts.

I purchased form Target for $99 plus tax. I cut the cable cord some years ago. I was between purchasing a Royku and this Apple TV. I wrote this review because some of the reviewers stated that smart tv owners would not want this. As a smart and basic HDTV owner, I disagree. Also, I cannot speak to the movie sources, etc. because that is not my interest. What I like most is the Airplay feature on the ATV. I have access to content I want on my iPad via the Internet. Being able to Airplay, and not just mirror is worth the purchase. I have used a a digital media adapter on the ipad before but there is no comparison in resolution or presentation for the adapter vs ATV and the adapter will cost about a third of the price for the ATV and still not airplay. So if you are thinking of going the adapter route - probably not. Some complained about the remote. I rather like the little remote, and like that it has some flex in it. I can see that it might get lost in sofa cushions, etc. but I am pleased with it. The ATV was extremely easy to set up. Another point I should make is that I installed mine on a secondary older HDTV that must be about 8 years old or more. As it relates to the discussion of older TVs, this works perfectly. It is an LG and has one HDMI port - ahead of its time when I purchased it. I was concerned about mounting the ATV on the wall mounted tv. I discovered that the ATV does not have to be visible for the remote to sensor to it, so I was able to hide the ATV in the tv casing. So if you want to watch movies, etc. there are apps for that. I like that there is free international news and other free apps. But I mainly use use Airplay to play iPad content - plenty video podcasts - such as time shifted cable news, and other feature programs, as well as free tv internet/cable/tv channels. Of course, photos, notes, and anything else can be air played as well. It did take a while to learn how to move from one tv input to the other without loosing tv functionality- but that is not a problem now. If you are not apple invested, and if you are mainly interested in movies- you may want to also look at a Royku, but this was a best solution for my purposes. And that should probably be the deciding factor, - what do you need a set to do for you that you cannot already do? Hope this helps and was not too rambling.And about You Tube, just Airplay it.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Loved it.", "Author": "Luis Murano \"Heavy e-Shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R361ZKESKLY0CL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Should only add the option to access your local downloaded files as well.

It's annoying because everything is like this. It's unlike every other streaming device, like xBoxes, Ps3's, iPads, iPhones, Smart TV's, BluRay Players, etc. So with this, you don't get some features other devices get since it's not the Netflix/Hulu experience that you get on EVERY OTHER DEVICE.

The \"Max\" service on Netflix, again, not there.I hope in a near future update they make the 3rd Party apps the way EVERY OTHER device uses it.Besides that huge con, the device is amazing.

I think the Apple TV is a near perfect streamer but I'm giving it 4 stars for only one reason: I cannot play music from it and to an airport express at the same time.  More on this later...-Why I got this?I wanted the Apple TV to be able to play music, and watch TV shows (i'm a cord cutter so I pay for a show or two here and there).  I also have speakers in multiple rooms in the house and wanted the ability to play music to multiple rooms simultaneously.  I had two airport expresses prior to the Apple TV.-How does it work?The user interface is smooth, well-implemented and works well.  Beyond iTunes, you also have access to Netflix, HBOGo, PBS, YouTube and a myriad of other services.  It's also nice to be able to show videos and photos shot on my iPhone on the AppleTV.  The Netflix app is one of the best I've seen.The Apple TV can also work with a bluetooth keyboard making it easy to search for content on Netflix, YouTube etc.It would be nice to be able to plug-in an external drive to play content, but Apple does not allow you to do so.  That's ok though as most people don't spend a ton of time ripping their CDs and DVDs anymore.  If you do have a large music collection and want access to it, just get iTunes match for $25/yr.  You'll have all your music up in the cloud and will have access to it on all your devices.  It would be to be nice to be able to store music on a connected external drive as I have kids and one of their hobbies is dragging DVDs on the floor to create deep grooves.  It would be nice, but it's not a deal breaker.-Areas of Improvement1) It would be nice if the next episode will be automatically queued up when watching netflix.  The family got a bit spoiled with this feature on our Sony Blu Ray player.  Again, not a deal breaker2) While the Apple TV has airplay, you can only use the AppleTV to play audio to one output at a time.  This is maddening.  I have to have a computer open with iTunes running to play music to two rooms in the house.  This is one area where I find the apple tv lacking.  It wants to be my media hub and I want it to be, but my computer still needs to be in the mix for me to use it as such.  While this also is not a deal breaker, it is a problem I hope Apple will remedy.-The Bottom Line:The Apple TV is a great streaming device.  It's everything you expect from an Apple product: It's elegant, reliable and easy to use.

Think of it as hooking up your computer to your TV via a HDMI cord but only it's wireless!I use it all the time because I like controlling my Netflix, Hulu Plus, etc on my iPad because it is so much easier to search and select on your iPad (compared to TV or gaming console apps), but it's much nicer to watch on a big screen TV. That alone is worth the price of the device.On top of AirPlay, it allows you to sync and get content from your iTunes library. Not to mention the every growing apps that come standard on Apple TV (although keep in mind most apps require you to pay for the service). My favorite free app is VEVO. When you have guests over, I generally just pick a genre and it's nice to have background music playing with the music video to match. Let's be real - we all miss watching music videos!

She's into tech stuff and gadgets and anything with an Apple logo on it, so she loves it. I like it too, but I have issues with it.There's only a couple of things I don't like about this, causing it to get a 3-star rating instead of 5 stars.For one thing, it has an app for Netflix and Hulu, but it has no app for Amazon's Instant Video. Granted, you can stream Amazon content from an iPhone, but it's annoying to have to do that. If my wife didn't automatically assume everything by Apple is the best, I'd have just bought a Roku device because that'll also play Amazon video.The other complaint is the tiny remote. I'm sure Apple-lovers are all swooning over how sleek and stylish it looks, but the remote is just entirely too tiny for my tastes. It gets lost every other day, because it's just so tiny. It's about as thick as a graham cracker, and it's very short and narrow. So it's always being buried and hidden under clutter, or it's always falling into cracks in the couches/recliners. I know it's unheard of for people to ask for bigger electronic devices, but it would actually be appreciated to have a conventionally-sized remote that won't get lost all the time.

Compared to a Samsung Smart TV with apps the AppleTV dominates. Compared to DirecTV with OnDemand the AppleTV dominates. Compared to the Netflix app on AppleTV iTunes movie streaming dominates. Compared to a Playstation 3 interface the AppleTV dominates. Samsung Smart TV lags terribly in the interface. Netflix app on AppleTV takes forever to buffer, stutters, and has limited content. AppleTV movies play within seconds, never stutter, and have all the new releases you'd expect. AppleTV even has content that hasn't hit theaters yet. If you buy an AppleTV it would benefit you to buy into the Apple ecosystem i.e. iTunes Match, Photo Streams, a Mac computer, and even an Apple WiFi Access Point. When you put all those things together everything just works. It may be a little more expensive upfront but it's worth it when it just works.

It provides an amazing service that makes it much easier to part ways with your monthly cable TV bill. For just under a hundred bucks, you get access to Apple's entire media ecosystem, including the hottest TV shows and movie rentals in HD. You also get access to apps like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube to round out your entertainment choices. And since all of this content is on demand, you don't even need a DVR.Setup and operation couldn't be easier. Just enter your Apple ID, your WiFi credentials, and you're good to go. Once you're online, it's easy to find what you're looking for. The menus are easy to navigate, and while typing in search terms with the included remote can be a chore, you can search for content.The two main drawbacks are 1) you won't find a lot of live content on AppleTV and 2) you can't sit back and channel surf (though in some ways, that's arguably a good thing). A simple HD antenna can do the trick for the major networks, but for events like basketball, you might be out of luck. And while you can purchase NBA, MLB, and NHL packages for use with AppleTV, licensing agreements black out a lot of the games you'll want to see anyway.That said, the amount you save by using and AppleTV over your cable TV service can't be overstated. Even if you purchase four or five seasons of your favorite TV shows and rent a couple of movies, depending on what cable TV package you have, you could easily save anywhere from $500-$900 a year. That's a lot of money.

The Airplay Mirroring feature, which broadcasts your computer screen, or video on your computer, directly to the TV is a good feature, although we experience some lag from time to time when we use it.

You can't watch an entire season in sequence (without going back to the menu and selecting the next episode).  I think that could really be improved with a \"Play All\" button or \"Play in Sequence\" or something like that.

Along with the remote control included with it, navigation of menus is really easy and apple-like. There's also an iphone/ipad app that you can use to control the apple TV, helpful if you lose the apple tv remote (the remote is rather small). The remote has 3 buttons - play/pause, menu, and a button for right/left/up/down/select. It's well made.I use it for netflix. We have netflix built into our TVs. But the user interface for netflix on the apple tv is slicker and easier to use than that on our TVs.The Apple TV has limited channels - not like the hundreds of channels offered on the Roku. I've never tried the Roku, but channel selection would be a good selling point for the roku. But the apple TV integrates very nicely with other apple products. You can use the apple TV to use airplay with your iphone, ipad, mac computer, apple airport express base station. You could use it to listen to music coming from one apple TV but piped into a tv hooked up with another apple TV.

You can set up slide shows using your images, show videos, or listen to audio from it. Everything is wireless- no cables required. You can also stream your Mac to the TV using airplay, also no cables!Even though the control is kind of clunky, it's small and gets the job done.

Most of all, the definition of the streaming quality is very good. I have it hooked into my bedroom TV right now, which is old so I can't say it's super HD yet, I still need to put it to the 1080p test...but I'm confident that it'll pass. This is a great addition to a high quality Tv's, because the new smart tv's are often a bit slow, and can't connect to other devices the way Apple Tv can. All in all, it makes life a bit easier and my TV watching experience a bit better!CON: The remote is pretty small and sleek, but I often find myself needing to type something in, and it's a total b**ch! I downloaded the remote app to type stuff in, but I don't really like it, sometimes my phone is unreachable!

Well, it has few other capabilities that are of more than passing curiosities to me, and the home sharing works horribly. I just spent about a half-hour getting the Apple TV to play a movie through home sharing. Five minutes into the movie, it stopped and displayed the message \"To access your iTunes library on Apple TV, turn on Home Sharing in iTunes on your computer.\" Obviously, \"home sharing\" is already turned on. Another ten minutes of tinkering and (hopefully) I'll be able to watch my movie. This problem didn't seem to occur when I first bought the Apple TV two months ago, but it seems to occur every time now. Extremely frustrating. If you want to access a streaming service like Netflix, the best solution is to connect a computer directly to your TV. You should also be able to access multimedia files directly from your home network, without the added hassle of iTunes.

I also wanted to use it for services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon to replace my Playstation 3 for media (I had every intention to sell my Playstation). I'm glad the eBay sale fell through because my intention of using Apple TV as my primary media device fell short.Problems:1. The Apple TV insists I rent HD movies, purchase HD TV shows because that's what I indicated during the setup. The problem with this is that I don't *always* want to watch something in HD. I don't *always* feel like paying the extra $1. Big budget films, season finales are where I splurge for the HD quality stuff. The lack of easy toggling between HD and SD without having to trudge through the settings or purchasing the SD version from iTunes on Mac/iPad first is a real pain and not convenient compared to Sony's Playstation Store which allows options.2. Where is Amazon? Amazon cuts deals with Sony, TV makers, Roku and other devices but can't manage their way into the Apple TV? I don't care who's fault it is, Amazon Prime Instant Video needs to be part of the Apple TV ecosystem. I already pay for prime and don't want to spend money for Netflix which would be completely redundant just so I could watch older seasons of TV. You can work your way around this using airplay mirroring on a Mac, but not an iPad which will block the image with airplay.3. Where is the media server capabilities? Sony has Playstation Media Server, which will push out content from your PC to the Playstation in HD without an issue. Apple TV will remedy this by Airplay Mirroring but it's completely picky about the formats. MKV is a no go, you'll have to spend a few minutes converting the file to an MP4 using MP4Tools (shareware program, works fine) for stuff to function. When it finally airplay mirrors to the apple TV i'll occasionally see stutters in the stream, though it's tolerable.4. Where is the ambition / extensibility? Where is the application store, the iOS game store? There is potential here for Apple TV to be the next big ecosystem for Apple. Like the iPad they could have opened it up for Apple TV specific apps to be built by developers to push their videos and content. But instead they've taken away the jailbreak method, and have very slowly opened up services over time. Apple TV right now just feels like a little box to bide the time while they work on the real successor to their TV ambitions.-----Those are all criticisms, but I'm not fully down on the little box. It's definitely attractively designed. The processor chip inside the Apple TV is smooth and opens services quickly compared to the aging Playstation 3. The interfaces for Hulu, Netflix and the iTunes services are attractively designed and easy to use. The Airplay functionality is mostly very impressive and music sounds great with the fiber optic sound output to the speaker system. The video might be struggling with the wireless N technology, but when things are at their best, the HD Airplay from the Mac looks great. It's pretty inexpensive and that's something you don't hear a lot about an Apple product. Roku is cheaper with more services, but iPhone, iPad or Mac owners should find serious value in Apple TV with Airplay and ecosystem benefits.-----I can't recommend an Apple TV to the non-Apple crowd. There are much better media options. As a streamer, Roku has more services and a cheaper price. For a premium experience the Playstation 3 has a nice Blu-Ray player, Amazon Prime Streaming, Netflix, Vudu, Media Server and video games which really makes it the most well rounded machine for every day use.Where the Apple TV becomes a worthwhile purchase is when you've attached yourself to the iTunes ecosystem for TV/Movies or you want a nice way to mirror videos/pictures/movies from your Mac/iOS devices. There's nothing quite as rad as watching a video game trailer on your iPhone and hitting the Apple TV icon to immediately see it in HD on your TV with your sound system. It's just too bad Apple never went for a home run with this little box.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "First Impressions - Needs more Content but Great for Up to Date Apple Users", "Author": "Taylor Walker", "ReviewID": "ROYAHFCOT0K56", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "About me, I'm a tech guy with 30 years experience. Over the past 2 years I have heavily invested in the Apple Eco System. I have IPods, an iPad 2, a 2012 Mac Mini, and now Apple TV (newest version). It's been well stated that there is not a lot available for content outside of the Apple Eco System as compared to Roku, for example.I've hardwired the ethernet connection to my router from the Apple TV, as suggested, to avoid overloading my wireless capability at home.I'm running the latest version of the OS on the Apple TV, Mirroring my Mountain Lion and Ipad screens is very handy.I've updated my review and added a 4th star because the 'wired ethernet causing content load failure' issue has been addressed. The device needs to have more content available and have it available from the Itunes store. That's the only drawback at this point that I see, and it costs 1 star...I have seen one 'bug' in the current version of the software. Loading select Vimeo content caused an error message stating that the content wouldn't load because my TV didn't support the 'HDMC' protocol (an encryption protocol used by newer HDMI devices). Recommended fix was replugging my Apple TV into the TV. That didn't work. Cold booting the Apple TV did fix the issue.As others have stated, this is a no brainer if you already have Apple products, especially newer ones. If you don't have Apple products, then unfortunately at this time, I could not recommend this product to you, it simply wouldn't have the value per the cost to you...

So I got stuck with it. The good things are that it streams really well and is pretty simple to use. The bad side is that it has way to little of choices for streaming compared to Roku. No appstore, no adding stations, way too controled and limited. The airplay seemed like a good idea but in reality Ive got other things to do with my computer besides streaming movies. My kids like to watch programs from some other sites that apple tv does not support. I like to use my computer for other things. I thought airplay mirroring would be really great but it is not very smooth many times. There are so many glitches while air playing through my macbook. Sound problems and video quality have been issues. I cant really recommend apple tv right now. Apple offers limited channels its super limited. Roku offers i believe around 750 channels.  When you turn on your apple tv youll see movies, tv shows, music, dedicated to guess who, yep Apple to buy or rent movies or tv shows of which you can find many on netflix or Hulu with your membership. The hulu plus on the apple tv does not give you all the content you get on your computer. I don't know why, thats even more limited. Amazon prime is not supported along with others. I wish I would have thought sooner. I suggest going with Roku or another streamer at least until apple gets a better selection. Apple makes great products but this particular one is lacking pretty big in available content and as I said earlier the mirroring features with airplay have not worked very well.

Scroll to the bottom, and you can toggle show/hide for each app.--To move apps around on the home screen, hold down the 'select' button and then you will be able to move it to wherever you like.--To go back to the home screen at any time, hold down the 'menu' button for a second or so.--Remote control:  You can pair the Apple TV with a universal remote (go to settings to set this up).  You can also control via the 'Remote' app in Apple's App Store, or even pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard (I have not tried the latter).--The Apple TV drives both the HDMI output and optical audio output at the same time.All in all, if you have an iPad/iPhone, I would say get this and enjoy!If you don't have an iPad/iPhone, it is still one of the best streaming boxes out there -- the Netflix and Hulu interfaces are the best I have seen.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to navigate flawless fast GUI", "Author": "Steve Burton", "ReviewID": "R39LLEIDRV73JM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great box.

By comparison, I can watch 720p Netflix with no delays at all.Another plus of the Apple TV is that the UI and remote are so easy to use, this is the first time my 76-year-old dad is using Netflix all by himself.

Roku has more channels, but I rarely watched them. I do like having Spotify on the Roku, but with AirPlay I can easily run Spotify on my iPad and mirror it to my TV/sound system. I think this device is excellent for what it does. My only complaint with the Roku was that it was flaky and I had to reset it frequently. Whether that was the device itself or the software running the channel I don't know. Hopefully it's better with the newer Roku devices. I will still use my Roku on another TV. I also have most of my media in iTunes. If you have a Mac and/or several iOS devices then an Apple TV is worth consideration over Roku. I couldn't be happier with it. My kids enjoy AirPlay because one can play on the iPad while the others watch it on the TV. That solved the problem with my oldest son getting irritated by his younger brothers crowding around him to watch him play on the iPad.In summary, I think both Apple TV and Roku are capable devices.

If you buy a series on iTunes, you need to click to start each episode.  If you are watching Hulu Plus, same thing.  The Roku will at least offer Autoplay in many apps, including Hulu Plus, where you can marathon a series without being interrupted to needing to find the remote after each episode and then click around to get to the next episode.My other gripe is Airplay with a mid-2012 Macbook Pro (upgraded with 16B ram and 512GB SSD) along with 80 MBps (yes, eighty MBps) wired internet.  There is a lag of about 1-2 seconds when you use the Airplay feature to play what you have on the laptop on the TV.  Voices do not line up with the audio, which is very annoying.I just find the AppleTV very limited at best.  Yes, I can watch video from my iPhone 4S, iPad 3, or 2012 MBP on my TV, but that's really about the extent of this device.I own a Roku 2 HD, PS3, Wii and Wii U, iPhone 4S, iPad 3, mid-2012 MBP.  I use the PS3 the most for streaming, followed by the Roku 2 HD.  I lent my AppleTV to a family member, who I think after one or two days gave up on it, and it is siting in their drawer.If Apple opened the AppleTV up to app makers for more streaming video choices, as well as the ability to Autoplay, then I would highly recommend it.

Recently it began glitching, and crashing which caused me to switch to the new Apple TV.I have a Macbook (and 'of course' an iPhone), so I thought to also give the tv a try since I greatly enjoy my other Apple products. Sadly, my finding were not what I expected...Though the Revue was one of the first Android TVs it contained a large number of apps, an app store, and a browser. While with Apple there is only a limited number of apps available, and no app store*. I assume it is because they would like users to purchase the shows via iTunes instead of 'renting' them. However, they have Hulu and Netflix installed which makes me wonder why apps like HBO-GO, or SHOWTIME ON DEMAND, are not available. As for the browser, when I had Revue I found it great, because it allowed me to watch shows (like HBO GO), or read check a social network site when the application was not available. Revue, honestly made it feel like there is a computer connected to my TV, while apple feels like I have a bunch of apps (which are standard on all blu-rays) extending the capabilities of my TV.The one good thing about Apple TV, which Revue lacked, was that it is very organized. The small number of apps makes it very clear where you are and what is available to you.*No app store means: limited number of apps online, and no games on your box (something I think apple would have profited from)", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can not live without my Apple TV", "Author": "Alicia", "ReviewID": "RU1W22PI93QIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We use it for Netflix, streaming on our iPads, sharing family photos and music.

It plays it via streaming.  They used to only stream rented movies, but NOW you can play any movies or tv shows that you've fully purchased via iTunes.What it DOESN'T do is allow you to play any iTunes extras (the added features that some iTunes movies comes with).  You'll need to run them through your Mac and send the \"broadcast\" over to your AppleTV.I also love the fact that it pairs up nicely with my Logitech Harmony remote. As simple as the included remote for ATV is, I like everything to be controlled through ONE remote... ONE remote to rule them all... and Apple TV plays nicely in that respect.Why ATV vs. Roku? Quite simply.... simplicity.  My roommate has my old Roku box.  And what I didn't like about it is that there were a plethora of \"channels\" to choose from, however, most of them had the same content that I could find on the Apple TV box and those apps (Netflix movies and shows, HuluPlus movies and shows, rental items from iTunes, sports apps, etc). You have to wade through all their \"channels\" to see what they were about and how useful they are to you. I found a majority of the channels NOT useful to me... even less useful when I found out that you had to pay a subscription services for a majority of those channels. And so this is why my roommate ended up with my Roku box.  He don't care. He's happy to have something for free.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mitsubishi WD-73c9 bulb", "Author": "jayjordan21", "ReviewID": "R3PVVHPKX2HGY7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast Shipping and Easy Install.

Buffington", "ReviewID": "R2Z3D0KD6RRIDH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are committed to the Apple ecosystem, the Apple TV (latest version) is a must have.  It allows you to stream all of your content from your main computer iTunes account to your TV in a superlative manner.  Additionally, you can stream purchased content directly from the iTunes store -- if you have purchased the content from Apple, you can stream it if you have a sufficiently fast internet service.  The newest software version of this device also allows you to access certain other content providers including Netflix.  Unfortunately but not surprisingly, this device does not allow you to access your Amazon Video-on-Demand account, which is truly a shame.  Nonetheless, this device does a lot and does it extremely well.I have been using Apple TVs since the second version, and it has come a long way.  This latest version unfortunately does away with the on-board hard-disk, which allowed one to place content directly on the Apple TV.  This was helpful for use in boats or RVs, where you might not have WiFi, internet, or the ability to stream from an iTunes computer.  On the other hand, the setup and use of this device is almost completely intuitive, and there is essentially no real setup procedure to speak of.  The device goes into sleep mode after being idle for a time, but simply click the remote and it immediately wakes up.  This works perfectly and effectively, and cures the grip that everyone had with the earlier Apple TVs, which was that they always ran warm, causing users to question the service life of the component.Overall, this is an elegantly engineered and well thought-out accessory that is a pleasure to use.  If iTunes is the major source of your content, this device is nearly perfect.  If not, you can still stream Netflix and certain other content providers, but it is somewhat limited in this regards.

Chang \"stan1911\"", "ReviewID": "R3GWET30HT7BHD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my Apple TV from Apple.  They didn't have a link for reviews so here I am. I specifically bought Apple TV as I read it can stream from iOS devices.  Ok, just what I wanted.  My 3 year old streaming DVD player has a limited Amazon menu.  No wishlist.  Small con but all my purchased vids are from Amazon.  My ipad retains Amazon wishlist entries. When I want to view one of my Prime vids on my HDTV, I have to note the movie title, then use search to find and select that movie on my DVD player's interface.So, after plugging in my brand new Apple TV squarish hockey puck, registering all the passwords for my wireless network WEP, Apple and Netflix accounts, I noticed Amazon was absent from the channel lineup.  Great access to iTunes purchased or rentals vids but the competition was not there.  No surprise I guess.So, on to Amazon vids.  Vids playing in other apps will only display vids through Apple TV if it's Airplay compatible.  Wish I knew that before sending $100 to Apple.  Vids playing on my ipad in Amazon's video app can send audio to the TV but not video.  However, vids in the Apple \"Videos\" app will play through Apple TV.  After all, \"Videos\" is an Apple app. I did notice Apple TV Netflix interface is several times faster than my older DVD streaming player interface.  The remote is what I would expect from Apple, simple and elegant.  30mm wide, 120mm long and 5mm thick tapering down to 2mm at the edges from a single piece of aluminum.  Uses a 2032 button battery. Slender but kinda easy to lose in sofa cushions.I looked into Roku but one reviewer found out that to activate his Roku account, a credit card was mandatory, just in case he made a purchase in the future.  Uh oh.  Another opportunity for a hacked commercial database to spread stolen credit card info, so I will live with Apple TV and continue checking my ipad for my Amazon wishlist movies to search for them in my DVD player Amazon interface.

However sometimes it just doesn't want to download my netflix movie or it just drops the movie in the middle.Another annoying thing, Apple updates the software and one time when they did it, some of the netflix features were missing, including access to my instant queue.  The next week or so that came back.  I suspect Apple wants you to use it's Itunes store rather than Netflix, so they make it a little inconvenient.I tried to get some movies to stream from my apple desktop machine, but I haven't been able to make that happen either very well. I got it to work once, but haven't gotten it to work again.One interesting feature is being able to show content from an Iphone or an Ipad.

You can't turn it on, you can't do anything with it.I had to make an appointment at the Apple store, then wait in line for my appointment, only to find that nobody in the store seemed to know much about Apple TV.  They took the batteries out of the remote on one of their display units, and since the remote seemed to make the lights on the Apple TV blink, they said I needed to buy a new remote battery (they didn't give me one)...  So I took it home, put new battery in the remote and of course it still did nothing.  Back to the Apple store - where after another hour of waiting they finally found a new remote control for me.  It was an excruciating wait for a $99 device to get fixed.  It would have been cheaper just to buy a new one.  It did work fine after the new remote.I hope they get the glitches fixed.

'Fraid So!", "Author": "Jon West", "ReviewID": "R268B1ARNH5F04", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Apple TV MD199LL/A [NEWEST VERSION]I wanted the Apple TV so I could access recorded shows from my DVR onto another TV.  I wanted it to be able to access my DVR and transfer live TV to my other TV.  After I bought it, I read some discouraging reviews stating that Apple TV can not stream HBO GO or others.  The Apple TV DOES enable me to stream HBO GO in full screen mode using AirPlay and not by mirroring.  I access NPR music and PBS apps on my Ipad, and play the concerts and shows on full screen ( a 42 inch LG and a 55 inch LG led 3D tv.) I do the same with HBO GO too.  All of these work on Ipad 2 and 4 and Ipod Touch 4. The clarity of the picture is incredible, better than the Roku -- which is pretty good and beats most built in smart apps included with newer DVR's and \"smart\" TV's.I use DishAnywhere on my Ipad and can access all the live TV channels I subscribe to including any and all in either HD or SD.  I can access ShowTime and HBO as well as NBC or Comedy Central.  I access DishOnDemand and watch the shows on my large TV from the Ipad.  I am also able to access my stored shows and movies from the DVR and play them on the Ipad and then via Apple TV view and listen to them on the large screen TV in full HD quality.  I am not using 'mirroring.'Note: My Apple Ipad 2 does not allow me to access Dish Anywhere except only by \"mirroring.\" That is not as good of an option since I cannot get the entire TV screen filled this way.  Also, regardless of which device I use, the Amazon app for the Ipad ( or Ipod Touch) will only broadcast the sound not the picture, so I would have to use mirroring for that app, but I have had a Roku 2XS, and I use that for Amazon Video streaming to access my Prime movies and others.The video quality on the Apple TV is brighter and appears to offer more definition and clarity than the Roku --- which, again provides an excellent picture.  I do not use Netflix but my wife is trying a one month sub only to get Blu Ray DVD's of a certain TV series. The Netflix app on the Apple TV is by far the best HD quality picture one can get.  The You Tube app is excellent since I can also use my paired Blue Tooth keyboard to search the Your Tube site.  The WSJ site is good too.  I am taken aback as to how much I can stream in HD from my Ipod Touch 4. I am using the Ipod over the Ipad to access the apps and DishAnywhere.Of course I can access the my iTunes library but I don't care to listen to the music on my TV.  I have a few movies in my library that I acquired via ultra violet or something like that which I have in my iTunes cloud. Playing them back from ?wherever they are via the Apple TV is a real pleasure. The color and picture quality are the best.

I also own an iPhone, a Time Capsule, an OG Apple TV... and between myself, significant other, and the friend crashing on my couch, the number of fruit-based electronic devices in my household currently numbers at... ten? Eleven? Fact is, I might be slightly biased.But! Another fact is this gadget may finally be the thing that convinces me that we're living in The Future. And why is that, you ask?AirPlay.See, the thing is that Apple has pretty much nailed the concept of dead-easy streaming to the big screen mounted on the wall (just like yuppies!). This has kind of changed my life. I consider myself, if not an audiophile, then at least an audio appreciator, and love and cherish my vintage, freshly re-foamed JBL loudspeakers. I have managed to basically make my entire A/V setup disappear from my living room as a result of this little box. I plugged a chip-amp in behind those speakers, and then just started using AirPlay. For everything. Soon, I'll have the ATV mounted behind the TV and poof! That's it! If I want to listen to a CD (yeah, I have a CD collection) then I'll pop it in the laptop and beam it over. Same with a DVD. Or radio from my phone. I select the ATV and those JBLs start pumping.And it gets even more exciting when someone has photos to show us or a spontaneous YouTube-off. All of it just goes straight to the TV, reliably, no fuss - just the occasional compression artifacts faintly audible.And that's the thing. It's not perfect. It's wireless, so I'm not wringing the ultimate in audio quality out of my ones and zeros. It's mostly a dumb box, requiring I have my laptop open if I want to listen off of my iTunes library, or buy things ala carte off the iTunes store more often than I intended to. I also really really wish I could add services to it. And honestly, if you're not as brand-centric as I somehow became, it's probably won't be so magical (what with AirPlay being proprietary and all). But it does 1080p, and has been the the trigger to completely upend my attitudes and behaviors surrounding media consumption and my home. I watch more videos. I listen to more music. I present things to my friends and learn more as a result. And that's not bad for the little black hockey puck once known as Apple's forgotten side project.TL;DR - I own a lot of Apple product, so this fits perfectly with my life in The Future, full of streaming and robots that fold my laundry.

We signed up for these through the Apple TV and after the free trials are over they will bill to our iTunes account.  We can turn the subscription on and off through iTunes.  Theinterface for Netflix and Hulu Plus is similar.  It looks like services like this work the same with the Apple TV vs. having apps that have completely different interfaces.  Youtube works well and the radio is nice also.  It's excellent.  The interface is really clean.  Setup is dead simple.  It seamlessly integrates other Apple devices.It also integrates with our iPads and iPhones.  Having it work with other Apple devices is surprisingly useful.  We airplay from these devices to the TV all the time.  We use this for Pandora, video clips that we come across from web pages, etc.  It's nice to put those up on the TV to show the family.  You can mirror screens as well.I have to say that it's cool to start watching something on the iPad (e.g. a Netflix documentary) and then resume on the Apple TV later on.  I do this all the time.  I start watching something on the iPad, maybe while the kids are using the TV.  Then when they're done I resume on the TV.  That's more of a Netflix thing than an Apple TV feature but obviously it all works together nicely and I want to mention it for those who are considering this kind of setup.We use the remote app to control the Apple TV and that works really well.  Also, the screen saver for the TV will pull from your photo stream so when we take a picture it immediately shows up on the TV's screen saver and photo stream,  Having access to everything you buy with iTunes is very nice.The remote that Apple provides is not bad.  I've seen reviews that complain about it.  It's small, yes.  But it's very functional and we make sure to put it on the coffee table or an end table when we aren't using it so that it doesn't get lost.  It doesn't allow you to control the sound on the television.  That would be a nice feature to add.Like any Apple device it automatically updates its software periodically when new versions are available.  It's very user friendly.Lastly, we used this setup plus a Winegard FreeVision TV antenna to eliminate cable TV.  We're *very* pleased.  My wife was a skeptic and pleaded to drop the idea.  I kept cable while we tried this and then I let her decide.  Our deal is that she can allocate the savings from cable to something else that we need (for the kids or the house).  She loves the new setup now that she's tried it.  The kids absolutely love it and thanked me for getting them Apple TV.  It's really about the entire system but they like how Apple TV organizes kids shows by character.  They flip through and then find new shows to watch.Buy it.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent little toy!", "Author": "SteamedFrog Shopping", "ReviewID": "R37LGKYDH074A8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, my initial plan was to save up and just buy a mac mini and hook up an external hard drive to play all my iTunes library, but that's going to take a while, and in the meantime, I had 4TB of iTunes videos (sad, I know) that had no way to get to my TV...so I picked this up. (Thank you, refund fairy!)It was a nice surprise that it didn't make me authorize it, since I've maxed out the number of devices I can authorize, and I didn't know who was going to get cut from the lineup (again, weep for me and my troubles!) and that made life nice.The downside was that the apple remote was operating my laptop and the apple TV at the same time, so while I got it on the network I think I watch/paused about five movies on my computer.I had to turn the home sharing feature off, then on again on my laptop to get the streaming effect going (not airplay, I think my computer is too old for that to work without airparrots assistance, but I hooked this up yesterday so haven't tried too hard yet) and then later when I went to change videos I had to do the same thing. Minor issue for me, but if you're operating a desktop in another room you might be led into temptation to use bad words after that goes on for a while. Also if the computer you're streaming from goes to sleep, that may or may not affect whether the movie continues (I just muted a really long music playlist)So I love this thing, but I also have months of iTunes exclusive video to play with...if you primarily watch other kinds of videos, I don't know that this will bring you nearly the skeeky joy it brought me.

Both versions look the same, but the 3rd gen. supports 1080p.We have a Netflix streaming subscription, and use the Apple TV for that, but there are many devices that offer access to Netflix, Hulu, You Tube, etc. so that isn't the reason to buy this, in fact the Roku box offers more in the web-based steaming channel category at the moment. The real reason to buy the Apple TV is the ability to stream media from your ITunes account.I've streamed my media to devices in the past, including an Xbox and a PS3, but this was the easiest by far. This is the only device ive ever had that my wife will actually take the time to use for streaming purposes. she always complained that the other setups i used were too tedious and unintuitive. With the Apple TV, iif you are on a network, and have a PC with iTunes running and Home Sharing enabled, you can access everything you have loaded into iTunes.Then there is airplay, which allows you to actually use your iOS device to communicate with the Apple TV. Anything you have in your iPhone or iPad can quickly and easily be shown on the Apple TV. Streaming music, videos and even viewing apps has never been this easy.

I love the AirPlay from my iPad and my Macbook, but I've yet to find a practical use for it in my house - it has come in handy on the ones we have at our office though.The very stylish but annoyingly tiny remote control is a frequent pain point. The fact that it is so small means it's always under our butt, between the couch cushions or otherwise hiding. I really just wish it had a normal size remote control as we've evolved our livingroom habits to efficiently manage those without losing them or sitting on them (much).Overall I'd say this product is well designed and fun to use but a bit too closed (platform limitations) and lacks a lot of the functionality I've come to expect from apple products.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "Diego", "ReviewID": "R1QP7KXZN3PA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with my purchase, having fun with my apple tv.-seven more words required to submit this form-", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple TV", "Author": "Anthony Womer", "ReviewID": "RH8BGCZSN8VFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works well,got it to use youtube & movies on youtube does good.

It has a nice solid, heavy feel to it and all the seams are very tight and smooth.  I used to own the Roku 2 and it was an inferior product both aesthetically and functionally. The obvious advantage that the Roku had over the Apple TV was the channel selection but that was about it. Setup on both devices is easy.  Plug them in, they find your wireless network and after the password is entered, you're good to go.  You have the option for a wired connection but for some reason the wireless works better on my network.  The GUI on the Apple is smoother and looks better than the one on the Roku.  The Roku is clunky and it takes forever to scroll through the channels, whereas the Apple has the channels on a grid pattern.  Picture quality is also superior on the Apple TV and the wireless streaming has been glitch free.  I had trouble setting up the homesharing but once it was up and running that also has been free of problems.  The only reason I removed a star on the rating was because of the performance of Airplay.  The sound quality is poor and it fluctuates during playback, becoming louder and softer continuously.  This could be a problem with my network but other people have also complained of this.  The bottom line is that this out performs the Roku with the disadvantage of a small channel lineup  which didn't matter to me because the main reason for this was the home sharing and the use of Netflix.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome if you already own other Apple products", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R3J10L2M41H5MO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works great with the iPhone, iPad and MacBook for mirroring, and I can use the Remote App to control it from the iPhone which is better for navigating through menus than the remote, which I can use with my MacBook.

Hulu Plus only works if the device is set to Wifi, even after a firmware update.  This is a known issue that Apple can't or won't straighten out with Hulu.  I can cope because the wireless streaming is reasonably fast and reliable ... BUT .... tonight I rent a movie on iTunes and it won't load unless I hard-wire the internet.  Tedious.If you're expecting the same quality you find in iPhones and MacBooks, then no, this isn't the same level of quality usually found in Apple products.

Setup with itunes cloud we play our own music collection off of the apple TV a lot, but many times we are having issues with the connection it took days, maybe even weeks before all of our library was available on the AppleTV. I think this is an itunes cloud issue and not a hardware issue. Applications for youtube isn't up to its best performance yet. Sometimes downloading itunes movie rentals or purchases gets stuck if the broadband internet connection isn't performing at top speed. Just for us, we found that Hulu plus isn't that great for providing additional options to Netflix. We use the mirroring for iphone and ipads every now and then but manytimes just using an hdmi cable direct between the iphone, ipad or laptop to the TV screen's hdmi port is many times the better option.the remote control for the AppleTV still has a lot to be desired---is quite small and hard to control even with my smaller female hands, but my husband and teen sons don't like the small size. Even i feel like the remote control is going to fall out of my hands while I use it. The controls are pretty basic, and I must see primitive. A keyboard would be a nice add-on option especially for the simple task of keying in words for searches, rather than toggling from letter to letter with the up-down-left-right RC buttons. Are you listening, Apple? (Wait! as per E.J.'s almost immediate comment, there is a free Remote Control app for the iphone and ipad that you can use with the Apple TV. I just tried it and it is a handy remote control alternative that I am still getting used to, BUT i really like tapping searches in for itunes, movies, netflix and youtube instead of toggling for letters. Highly recommend using it with Apple TV now. Thank you, E.J., for the tip)So lots of 3rd-party factors going on for the AppleTV to perform to its max, but we don't regret cutting our cable TV off and saving 70% off of our ATT Uverse bills!I read up on jailbreaking the AppleTV to get more content on this thing, but I am looking forward to a paradigm shift for smart TV so that more content will be made available through this medium.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love.

If you are wanting a media system that is reliable, responsive, easy to use and offers solid pack of features the apple TV 3 is the unit to buy.  I have two in my home.  I will give you the pros and an outline of how you have to set up a system with this unit.1. The wireless feature is high quality I have never had an issue with data transfer or streaming video. (my router is in the basement and my apple tvs are upstairs)2. The family share feature allows you to access all your music, photo's and video files on your home network.3. The screensaver options are extensive and easy to personalize. I have 300 photos that cascade across the screen with music playing from my library. Great feature for parties.4. The slideshow feature has a large selection of shows that all play music , play in fixed order or shuffle and are great for parties also.5. The video and photo libraries work the same as the itunes music library so cover art and genres are easy to set-up. (FYI  the video and photos are run through the itunes program)Out line system configuration:If you are wanting all your videos in a network storage system and your DVDs in a box this is the best way to do it from what I have expereinced.You will need all of the items below:1. Dual band Wireless router with 802.11 N speed equiped with video streaming  ( I use a  Belkin N750 Dual Band Wireless N Gigabyte Router2. Network storage device  (media server, DNLP, NOS  I use a WD MY Book Live  6TB)3.  Dedicated work station  ( I use an old window xp tower this computer will sit in the corner and run 24/7  mine is in the basement)4. Apple TV 35. iTunes installed on the workstationThe set up is easy, just follow the instructions for the network storage the My Book Live is super simple.  Install the itunes on the workstation (basic computer for nontechies) connect the workstation to the router and load your media on the storage system then copy links to itunes (drag and drop to itunes).  Install apple TV 3 on tv and follow on screen set up. Activate home sharing on itunes and apple TV now you have access to all your personal media.  (side note: if you don't know how to copy your DVDs to your network you will need ripping software.  Their are several free programs on the net I recommend a software package called DVDFAB it cost $200 for the suite but, is the best I have used no more legal notices, movie previews and can convert standard dvd  and bluerays to appleTv langauage (Mpeg4)", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great item!

I started out with a very nice Roku 2XS which worked just fine out of the box, detected and connected to my network, and functioned exactly as it was supposed to. Then... I realized my iTunes library was completely inaccessible and realized I'd made a mistake. So I ordered the Apple TV from Amazon. Here are my observations:1) The fit, finish and packaging for this most inexpensive of Apple's products is as good as anything else Apple makes. It does not appear like a stepchild in Apple's product line. It is an extremely tactile, compact, weighty little device with clean lines and is a perfect physical match for my new flat screen.2) The user interface is far and away superior to that for the Roku or any other similar device I've tried. Some thought has gone into their software for this device and it's the most usable in its class.3) The \"channel\" selection through AppleTV continues to grow, and so far as I can tell, this item offers more options that the Roku.4) The Airplay connectivity with my wireless PC works as expected. It's a very pleasant experience to find your complete iTunes media library accessible directly on your set without being forced to connect yet more cabling. I have a 2Wire router from AT&T; and the performance is easily good enough for high-def movies and TV shows. This is the main reason I went with this device. I am quite satisfied. I can now see new episodes of \"Justified\" and \"Mad Men\" when they come out on iTunes the day after the episodes air. You can't get everything in the most timely manner through iTunes (Game of Thrones? Hello? HBO?) but this is a large chunk of a good solution for people like me who refuse to subscribe to cable.I would eventually like to see Apple manufacture another version of this product with a 2-3 TB hard disk.

The rest of the streaming devices I have are all 780p, so streaming Neflix at 1080p and projecting it on to a wall makes it look like you almost blu-ray quality.  I  also 'airplay' music from my PC where I have 100s of songs stored to this device and then to my Pioneer receiver.Now the complaints...con #1: In terms of content, it is rather limited. I have an account with Amazon Prime and would love to watch the free streaming movies available online, but unfortunately it is something I cannot do with ATV3.con #2:  I have on the unit is that it's remote is flimsy and Apple really needs to review the design of it. Quite often, in a dark room, it is hard to locate the buttons on the Popsicle stick like remote. I wish the buttons were not so sensitive or the remote had some low led light although I agree this would consume battery life out.con #3: This is a common complaint, apple needs to figure out the keyboard.  Searching for a movie using the ATV3 can be quite frustrating at times using the onscreen keyboard. I have a 10 year old no name digital recorder and it has the same keyboard, so it is not something i was expecting from one of world's leader in innovation.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good product.", "Author": "Linda K.

I wish it had more channels like the Roku, but Airplay makes up for that for everything I personally watch.  It will be great if and when Apple decides to allow more apps on the ATV.  It has huge potential.  The biggest drawback for me is the lack of support for external storage.  I already have an HTPC setup so it was not difficult to keep iTunes open to watch all of my videos.  But if I could just attach an external HDD with all of my music and videos, that would be ideal.  Roku does this to a limited extent.  There are other devices that allow external storage I know, but they have drawbacks in support and function that just aren't worth it.  So I will stream ITunes for now and wait to see what Apple comes up with next.  I have an Xbox and previously used it for all of my streaming.

I am able to connect my phone and complete a mirror image, but I then lose the connection. This may be due to the firewall on the WiFi, or may be due to using a slightly older phone? I will continue to explore this issue and update if a solution is found. Since I have many capabilities of viewing videos, I am not sure I will miss this feature.

However, I don't recall seeing a lot of detailed operational instructions with it. Admittedly, I am one who installs first and reads the instructions later.

The user interface is easy to navigate and I like the feature where I can see trailers for movies and if I don't have time to watch it now, I just place it in my wish list or queue. They also provide customer and critic's reviews. I am running both Apple TV and Roku 2 XS side by side. I did it because I wanted to see which one was the best overall with the intent to returning one of them. Instead I kept them both. I'll save the Roku evaluation for a little later but they are both very good streaming devices with different user interfaces and slightly different offerings. The quality of streaming HD movies on Apple TV is outstanding. I was pleasantly surprised. There is absolutely no freezing, choppiness (truncation) or any other distractions. I ran out of HDMI ports on the TV (which you must have to ensure the highest picture and sound resolution), so I purchased a HDMI switch to hook both Apple TV and Ruku 2 XS. So depending on which product I use, I just switch back and forth. I would also recommend that you not spend a lot of money on expensive HDMI cables. That is simply a lot of hype. You can buy very good HDMI cables for around $15.00 give or take. Just so you know you must have adequate bandwidth. I run at about 24 Mbps and am using a Linksys Gb router.

If airplay mirroring won't work for you, and you don't intend to update your hardware, you may want to look at the Roku (no you-tube option to date) or another streaming device, which has more \"in the box\" streaming options than the apple TV has.However, for me and any other Apple devotees, this is the streaming device you want to attach to your \"un-smart\" TV (and possibly your smart TV as well).", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Nicholas James Jeffrey", "ReviewID": "R1Z2BI9RCTD01", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have become an Apple guy.

If you've used an iPhone iPad or iPod touch you will figure this out in seconds. Those are some of the reasons I've given it 5 stars.You can get sports subscription streams, Netflix and Hulu plus, all require subscriptions. I'm unsure of amazon prime. I've read that there isn't an app but there is a workaround using amigos device and airplay.I use streaming apps quite a bit and even though I have cable uverse with all the pay channels I still find myself watching streaming media at home. I like being able to quickly find and watch a movie I want without any additional hook ups or hardware.When family or friends visit I like to stream a folder of pictures, maybe from the last holiday we spent together, maybe from an adventure, he'll maybe you enjoy the kinds of pictures that aren't appropriate for everyone. You can quickly separate your shots into folders or albums and share just the album you want with your guests on a nice tv screen. Beats passing your iphone around to everyone.Based on apple being the dominant force in streaming, media, streaming media and media streams I would recommend this over similar boxes.

This has actually been really useful as someone who's on the move a lot, its my go to carry around netflix box. Airplay works well, but be aware that even on a good router system the streaming can stutter or require more than the initial buffering. These things being said, my initial concern with the apple tv was that it didn't do a lot on its own. However, the box is mostly designed to be an accessory to the apple ecosystem, so with the introduction of itunes match, screen mirroring etc. the utility of the device has improved. This of course means that if you're looking for a standalone box that does the streaming stuff on the big screen, its probably more worth your money to get a roku box, or an xbox both of which do the same things as the apple tv and more. If you're pretty invested in the apple ecosystem however, this box is extremely worth it because it's a quick and effortless way to get all your content onto the big screen.Weird things to note:Optical audio out doesn't work with netflix for some reason.Remote is small and easy to lose.Recommended that you get a sound system for your tv... the speakers on most tvs aren't great and with such an audio/video centered device, this is a big letdown.

I love my roku, that now lives in our bedroom.  We moved to the AppleTV mainly because I wanted to ditch cable and save some money.  Being in an Apple household (2 macs, 2 ipads) it just made sense for us to move to the Apple TV, but the main reason for us was the iTunes integration.  iTunes had everything we wanted to watch, so we knew moving to the AppleTV was going to give us the widest range of options for watching what we wanted.In addition to Netflix, Hulu & iTunes rentals and purchases, you can access anything that's in an iTunes library on your network.  So we've converted all of our DVD's to .mp4's and stored them in iTunes so we can quickly get to the videos we or the kids want to watch.  It's easy enough to operate that my 3 year old can use it, and has parental controls to block access to specific channels that I don't want my daughter getting to (like You tube). I do wish it would allow you to block content by rating, however I've yet to see that on any set top box to date.The one thing that really bothers me on this unit is that backing out of an app is a bit of a pain.... It's essentially hitting the back arrow on your browswer... back for every movie you've viewed till you get back to the home screen.

The Apple TV can stream from any Mac's publicly shared files or iTunes library, or you can access Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, Vimeo, and more from the built-in apps on the main screen.We love the remote: it's small and to-the-point. There are two buttons and a navigation circle with four buttons. It may sound too simple to function well, but that's not the case at all. We've found that when we have guests over, they instinctively know how to use it when they first pick it up.There is a downside: You can't stream every format, so Apple TV may not be a good fit for some people with large movie libraries on their computers.

So far,I have been so impressed with it that I am considering purchasing a second one for the master bedroom.  Setup was quite easy.  Out of the box, you just plug it in, connect the HDMI cable (sold separately), then turn on the TV and select the appropriate input on your HDTV.  It then begins to search for WiFi, select your WIFI, enter the password, then your in.  After that it asked for an Apple ID and password that can be used to purchase movies and video.  The primary reason I purchased the Apple TV was to have access to Russian TV channels over the internet.  The provider had an App in the App store in which I downloaded to my IPad 2.  It took me quite some time to figure out how to stream the video and sound from the IPad to the HDTV.  When I selected \"Apple TV\" as the source from the IPad, it only projected the sound.  Finally, through some diligent Google searching, I finally figured out how to stream both video and sound.  If you quickly double click the main button on the IPAD it shows a list of your most recently used Apps.  If you then swipe your finger to the right you'll see a circle with an arrow on it.  Click on that and it allows you to choose between \"IPad\" and \"Apple TV\".  If you choose \"Apple TV\" you then choose to turn mirroring \"On\" or \"Off.\"  If you choose \"On\" then you mirror your IPAD on the HDTV.  This is how I was able to stream video and sound from the App.  Airplay and Airplay mirroring are two features that make this product well worth it.I have also tried streaming music from Pandora to the TV from my IPhone 4 and it worked quite well with good sound.  However, I did learn that when Pandora shows a commercial, it shows the actual video on the TV which disrupted my photo slide show at the time.  I thought this was quite annoying because I had to go back in and reset the slide show.  I have rented a movie and previewed several movies.  For the previewed movies, the time for the Apple TV to start the preview was quite long because it had to download enough of the preview.  Therefore, I had to upgrade the speed of my DSL, which has helped quite a bit. We rented the new Avengers movies and the quality of the picture was top notch.  I have also tried NetFlix (free one month trial) and Hulu Plus (free 7 day trial).  However, I haven't been entirely impressed with the selection of videos.  However, I thought NetFlix was slightly better than Hulu.Overall, I give the Apple TV 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too limited in the programs available.  Plus Amazon instant video doesn't support Airplay mirroring which is a huge bummer because that would open it up to much more options for everyone.  Only the sound is projected from IPad without any video.  In the end, I would still highly recommend the Apple TV.

But just last week, my family \"Cut The Cord\" from our Dish Network, picked up Hulu and Netflix and have enjoyed the results. Partly because the aTV offers us the freedom of having all the services we have come to enjoy in such an easy device, but also this device isn't static. Clean interface and extremely easy setup, the aTV offers the ability for my family to use it anywhere (given there is an internet connection).Pros:-The Apple Tv is clean. Being slightly bigger than a hockey puck and almost as thin, this little device can be placed virtually anywhere.-With more than one service (Now) currently available, the device makes it really nice to watch different content without having to pay the large price tag that comes with cable.-With Netflix, Hulu, MLB, NBA, NHL, iTunes, Vimeo and many more available, the hours that have been spent and will be spent are going to be countless.-1080p content on the Apple TV is visually Astounding. Even at 720p, the graphics and display of the aTV making watching TV more enjoyable with crisp, clean graphics.-User interface is extremely simple. With navigation of the device with the Apple Remote (which comes with the device) or the Remote App for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, makes traversing the content and options easy and quite simple compared to the Roku  or Netgear Neo.Con: (Yes there are a few)-Unlike many other services (Xbox Live, Playstation Network, Roku, Netgear Neo, Boxee), Apple TV doesn't offer other options such as Crackle, Voodu, Ultraviolet, or other services. If Apple hasn't released it in an update, it's not there.-Although much of the content can be accessed via Netflix and other services, not being able to access downloaded movies from Amazon or even your external HardDrive is a huge Con especially if your not limited to just one service provider for content.-iTunes is great for movies, music and tv shows, but there are many networks that allow these to be streamed for free over the internet. The Apple Tv doesn't allow for any connection to them (Unless your willing to break your warranty by Jailbreaking (unsuggested)).-There is no music services like Pandora, Last.Fm, or Spotify available.-HDMI is the only connection and is not supplied with the device.Overall:If you are looking for a great media streamer, with NetFlix, Hulu, many sports and the ability to watch previous movies/shows that have been purchased or downloaded with iTunes. Then Apple TV is right for you. Unlike many of the other media streamers, the interface and controls are much smoother and the experience is more enjoyable. If you have ever used or owned an Apple Product, the same quality that is used to make those products is used here with the Apple TV.I have tried and used many other of the media players and can say that you get what you pay for. $100 is seems like nothing when you don't pay $100's of dollars a year for cable/Dish services.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Apple Accessory", "Author": "Chuck", "ReviewID": "R23BNPC5LIDJFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great add on for anyone with an iOS device and an HDTV.The ability to stream photos, music and video wirelessly from you iOS device is great for entertaining friends and show.You can also sync it with your Apple iCloud Photo Stream and it will display your iPhone or iPad's photos as your HDTV wallpaper...pretty cool!", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Delivers exactly what it promises", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R324PN3Z2W8MQU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Product.

Apple just needs to commit further to it.  They did add Hulu Plus recently, and that is a BIG plus indeed.  However, they keep adding new iPads, etc but they refuse to bring the App Store or any real app ecosystem to the Apple TV.While it is a far more polished experience than Roku (which I also have), they need more apps.  Obviously they can handle an app ecosystem based on their success with iOS apps and the Mac App Store on OS X but they choose not to with Apple TV.If you use iTunes a lot (I would say I'm more on the music side, and have iTunes Match) and like to use AirPlay from your devices, this is still a killer product.  But I'd love to see more apps.Also, this is a far better option than using other devices like your gaming system.  I used to use my Xbox all the time for this type of media but Apple TV is far less power hungry and I feel that any long use of Xbox is just that much time spent moving closer to hardware failure so I save that time for gaming on it.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "wonderful", "Author": "Amit Hasky", "ReviewID": "R30MW1GK1UIFP9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "works great, you can see your aperture photos, itunes music and itunes movies and tv series.works with Hebrew  subtitles.i use a third party app to edit my movies metadata to match apple look and feel.a wonderful product,", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great, easy to use product.", "Author": "D.

The airplay works great and you can stream music / photos and video to your TV (even though at a compressed format for high quality videos). It's a great way to share media with friends and family at home.If you are getting a streaming box to watch movies from the internet such as Hulu and Netflix, this is also the device to get. I think it has the most user-friendly interface out there for the most popular apps (but the lack of back button on the remote was confusing initially). Unfortunately, it doesn't have the Amazon Instant Video app, so it might be a deal breaker if you are a Amazon Prime user. Everything you buys from iTunes is also available to stream from Apple TV. And it also streams everything you have on your iTunes library.The only people I would not recommend to get this are the PC users looking to stream stuffs from their PC without going through iTunes. Since iTunes does not play a lot of video format that are popular on PC such as MKV, AVI, WMV, you would need to convert your video library to iTunes compatible format e.g. mp4. It may not be your best use of time. Some people had success jailbreaking an older generation of Apple TV that allows them to stream media without iTunes but as of the date of this review, it does not look like this Apple TV is jailbreakable. I would recommend getting the Roku 2 XD or XS for such users. They are available at Amazon at similar, if not lower, price.So if you are invested in iTunes and Apple hardware, definitely get this.

In fact, since getting the Apple TV I haven't even turned on the Wii. The Apple TV is much faster at downloading content for play and rarely pauses during playback. For that alone, I would have given the Apple TV 3 stars. Because there's so much more to love about the Apple TV, I've given it 5 stars.Things I love:1. Airplay Mirroring - if I want people to see something I'm doing on my MacBook, I turn on Airplay Mirroring and just like that, it's on the TV. No more trying to squeeze in to see the MacBook screen or dragging a cable across the room to connect the MacBook to the TV.2. Playing content from a computer - as long as Home Sharing is setup I can pull music and video directly from a computer and play it on my TV. The perfect exercise music is always easily accessible.3. Customizing the Home Screen - with the latest Apple TV update, I can remove the home screen icons that I don't use. With parental controls I was able to remove some of them before, but now I have complete control, minus a few \"required\" icons.4. The Remote App - conducting a search on the Apple TV can be somewhat of a hassle if you are using the Apple Remote that it comes with. Once I started using the Remote App on my iPhone, a keyboard pops up on my phone that I can type the search query in. Down, down, right, right arrow pushing is not required to get to the next letter.5. Size matters - the Apple TV is so small, making it easy to place anywhere. I set it on top of my DVR along with a Kinivo 501BN Premium 5 port High speed HDMI switch with IR wireless remote and AC Power adapter - supports 3D, 1080p, which is on a OmniMount Tria 1 B - 1 Shelf Wall Furniture (Black/Dark Glass) mounted behind/above my TV.6. iTunes integration - renting or purchasing new movies/TV shows from iTunes is so fast and easy.

Likewise, eventhough the promotion makes the case that the steaming is 1080P, the video shows decided compression effects.The result is a useful product, but do not expect the sound or video to be a mirror of the same content one generation prior.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything I wished for and more", "Author": "BMS \"As I see it.\"", "ReviewID": "R2FBGK8OUC25HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was astounded by the capabilities of this little device and it's ability to deliver crisp clear HD clarity over wi-fi. I won't get into the details as all the other reviews cover most of the plus points. I'll just offer some lessons from my learning curve.For those with a high-end A/V system and planning on using a Logitech 900 remote, I'll just say this was fairly easy to set up under \"activities\". Tip: you won't find a \"logical\" category for it in the remote set-up guide, so instead look for it under \"computers/Media PC\" and type in Apple TV as the device. I have this little guy tucked away in a closet in the bedroom and controlled by the RF blaster. It's hooked up to my Harmon Kardon A/V system using the optical cable for sound with video through HDMI. Wi-fi is over a newer dual-band Cisco router. No problems at all streaming HD movies at 1080i!One other tip for those planning to stream video through iTunes. When converting/ripping HD movies (720 or 1080) using handbrake or some other program make sure to set your fps rate to 30. Anything less, and you'll get very \"choppy\" almost slow-motion output to the TV. I tested every scenario to try to fix this problem until realizing it was the fps setting! Also keep in mind that ATV does NOT play all types of files and MPEG4 (MP4) is the preferred type. Some formats such as MKV, AVI and others will not load into iTunes and subsequently ATV. You'll need to \"jailbreak\" it to be able to use other formats (Someone please let me know when you figure it out..haha!!).", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great technology, if you have the right system", "Author": "Mark S.

I never did hook it up, always next weekend's project, although the hookup is ridiculously easy. I never could get the Apple TV out of my head. Yes, it offers less services than Roku but as with all or most Apple products, the ease of use and seamless integration with other Apple devices can't be beat. I hooked up the Apple TV the day I got it. Just FYI, if you go through an HDMI switch you can't get sound without a toslink digital audio cable, at least I couldn't. No problem, I bought a toslink 1:3 switch on Amazon a while back so connecting the Apple TV with HDMI for video and toslink for audio was a breeze. Using Air Play in Mountain Lion and iOS 5 and 6 (Macbook Pro and Air, iPad 3rd gen, and iPnone 5 respectively) was just as seamless as advertised. There is a bit of lag but that's to be expected in Central Florida with the broadband traffic. Even with the slight lag, the ability to stream video and audio so easily is terrific. My iTunes Match music showed up almost immediately on my Samsung HD TV and in another couple of seconds the music started playing through my theater system. I inevitably have to bring work home so seeing my desktop on the big TV screen is a nice alternative, especially when I'm using my 11\" MAcbook Air.Because I haven't hooked up the Roku, i can't say how its video and audio compare. Of course it doesn't do Air Play so there is no streaming from Apple devices to the TV.So why the 4 stars for the Apple TV? Even with my small hands, using the remote is frustrating. It's just so small that I'm forever pressing it incorrectly, causing delays when trying to navigate or type in passwords etc. I actually have to press it with my nail instead of the pad of my finger in order to be accurate. Also, the display on the Macbooks becomes so tiny when using Air Play that I can barely see it, although there's probably a way to adjust this other than by increasing the magnification manually.All in all, I don't regret my purchase. I'm not reinventing the wheel when I say that if you have a lot of Apple stuff, the Apple TV is the way to go. If not, the Roku may be the better choice.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect... most definitely worth the price", "Author": "Adam V", "ReviewID": "R1U6WHMEP2DQIA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the the Apple TV. Although it isn't mature enough for myself, it still feels like there is room to grow, it is growing and becoming a better product and is already a great device for most people. I bought it once Hulu was announced because I ditched TV and wanted a low power media streamer that had Netflix and Hulu. With this last update to iOS 5.1 for the Apple TV, it added the ability to move icons which I think is pretext to Apps, which would make this a killer device. I am already exited for the possibilities this brings to it. I would recommend buying if you already have any of the Apple Ecosystem like the iPad, iPhone, iPod or Macbook.Pros:Low Power UsageHas Netflix and HuluCan stream my media from iTunesCan use my iOS devices as a remoteCan stream pictures and video from my iPhone to Apple TV with easeCan stream my Macbook screen to Apple TV with easeNEW: Can stream from Apple TV to Airplay speakers!Cons:Making it sleep is kind of a pain, you need to force it in settings or wait 15 mins.

Because I already had that cable, I wasn't sure if buying an Apple TV was going to be any improvement for me. I'm glad I took the chance.  Now I can do Airplay mirroring all wirelessly!  I can easily share photos and videos from my iPhone/iPad on my TV without needing to stand nearby for the wire.  I am a Netflix customer and another great benefit is being able to access the on demand Netflix movies right from Apple TV.  The Netflix interface is beautifully designed and easy to use.  I also like the fact that the Apple TV will automatically power down after a period of inactivity, so you can leave it plugged in all the time.  The only thing I didn't like about the Apple TV is that when you have to type something such as your Netflix login, you have to navigate an on-screen keyboard with the Apple TV remote, which is not very easy.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "APPLE TV..

First of all YouTube has zero problems buffering and streaming Unlike some of the other devices I have tried with YouTube.. including Google TV!! And the newest model has Hulu. The navigation menus are very user-friendly to navigate. Netflix YouTube and Hulu it works great. Also if u have a iPhone you can download the remote control and link it to your AppleTV so when you type you don't have to scroll using the remote to type each painstaking letter one by one..
