{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing TV!", "Author": "Brian Keeley", "ReviewID": "R2EYTEPHDR49C9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this TV for Christmas to go with my new PS3. I can not believe the quality of this picture. My parents have a 32\" Panasonic, which i thought had a great picture, but this Samsung puts that to shame! I have it hooked up to an Upconverting Samsung DVD player (HD960) and the quality is amazing. All my movies look incredible upconverted to 720p and 1080i. The color on this TV is beyond belief, must be that 3000:1 contrast ratio. Watching movies like the Incredibles or Moulin Rouge is sensory overload. My PS3 and Blu-Ray movies obviously look incredible as well, like looking through a window. Perfect TV for a smaller room (mine is for a dorm room), though with quality this good it would use it in the living room if i had too. Don't hesitate to buy this T", "Date": "December 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "xbox 360/PS2/PS3/GameCube, HD/Blu-Ray and regular DVDs", "Author": "Guy2", "ReviewID": "R17X99PYANSMMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this in J&R; (NYC) for $680 including tax.Which was actually listed here (for roughly the same price) some time ago.PLease note that I'm only using this set for the xbox 360, PS2/PS3, GameCube, HD/Blu-Ray, and regular DVDsSo i can't say anything about the TV broadcasts.This set looks great;shiny black lacquer finnish, smooth looking, and at first glance seems more expensive than it actually is.Very clean and classy looking. Not to mention the black finish really enhances the picture.Very easy to setup. One person job. There's nothing to clean up really.I just stuff everything back in the box once i'm done.And there no small foam pieces.Menu navigation is relatively easy. The remote is like any other remote.Usues 2 AA bateries (included). Very nicely shaped though.All the color presets are terrible.Go to the setup menu and set the display to Game Mode whether or not you're playing games.If you don't turn it on the pictures can seem dull and dim.Switch to game mode and the pictures will be brighter, the colors will be deeper, and the lines will be sharper.-For the PS2(component)/Cube(s-video),this set comes with 4:3 display mode, so you don't have to worry about stretching the game display.And it's just a press of a button between widescreen (16:9) and full screen (4:3) on the remote.Unfortunatly very few PS2 titles support progressive scan, but for the games that do, it's an immediate and obvious improvement.Some (newer) PS2 systems can actually output progressive scan even without an in-game option.Insert PS2 game, press and HOLD triangle and X before the Playstation Logo until the game starts.There should be a couple of flickers and a slight pause before the game starts.Some Gamecube games acually support progressive scan, but none of the games are widescreen.Unfortunately the GameCube component cables are expensive and even more unfortunate the new GC models dont even have the component cable plug.-PS3 (HDMI)It really demonstrates just how great this TV is.The blu-ray movies are simply stunning.The colors are amazing, it's vibrant, it's vivid, and every little detail is so very meticulous even more so through HDMI.-For the 360 (via VGA or Commponent)This TV supports 480p, 720p, and 1080i.Use component cables if you don't want to bother with the color settings too much.The component cables out put really vibrant colors, very distinct RGB colors.Though through the VGA connection, there seems to be more detail and a slightly bigger resolution.It gets very technical, so if you want to know more about VGA vs. Componet you'd have look for a better source.I tried the VGA connection with a few games just to see if they look better and the picture is noticably more detailed.In Dead Rising the decay on the zombie are more discernable and the creases on Frank's clothing are more visible.in R6 Vegas, the equiment details are noticably more meticulous.Especially in Gears of War, go to the downpour level, the rain effects are even more stunning, you can practically see each and every drop.HOWEVER, the colors seem washed out, less vibrant, and a whole lot brighter.So you will definitely have to mess with the TV color settings to get the colors to your satisfaction.And with this TV, especially with game mode and dynamic contrast turned on, it looks almost like component connection (but with more detail).Also almost all 360 games have an in-game brightness adjust and in-game color presets.SO tweak it to your eye's content.-NOT SUPPORTED MODE- (xbox 360 DVD playback)With SOME regular DVD movies i get the \"Not Supported Mode\".To fix that you need to switch the 360 plug back to standard display.And the movie will play fine.I don't know why but some DVDs just can't be displayed through the 360 HDTV signal.Maybe the 360 is trying to upscale the DVD to progressive scan.Some movies allow that and some movies don't.The TV speakers are actually pretty good (in a small room).It actually gives out directional sound (left, right, or both as center), it's very deep and has nice bass (again, in a small room).Though I'm no audiophile so there isn't much I can say.And yes my room is pretty small.But I did buy a set of desktop speakers, the Klipsch Promedia Ultra 2.0.And the TV speaker can actually be the center channel.So all you need is to either buy a good set of desktop sepakers (2 piece) or buy a 2.1 sound system (3 piece) for better surround sound.The Klispch speakers are connected via the headphone input on the back.FINAL THOUGHTSI've had this set for a few months now.I'm VERY satisfied with it. It's amazing for it's value.It's a great size for a small room.It's perfect for playing games in HD and watching movies (in all formats).There arent that many HDTV in this size nor in this price range with this kind of quality.", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sharp & Crisp", "Author": "Morton Genser \"Moshiach6\"", "ReviewID": "R85AC40B9PFYS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is as sharp a picture as i have seen,and i am 69 years old,my wife and i love it.We use it in a small room, sound is good also.My other set is a 57\" Sony HD this one blows it away.", "Date": "December 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good if you don' t have a plasma in the house...", "Author": "R.

My review is biased because I have a larger plasma set (Panasonic), and the clarity on a plasma is much more intense than on a LCD, however the LCD handles standard definition digital signal better than the plasma.  The plasma seems to blotch out non-HD feeds.  Overall, the Samsung is an average LCD, HD feeds are OK to above average, but I just can't get over the limited viewing angles inherent to LCD viewing.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great picture, great value", "Author": "MJS \"Constant Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z0IAA2MMKQKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for an economical replacement for the very old (no A/V input!) tv in my bedroom.
