It has an abundance of features and I have gotten addicted to the ability to browse the web on it.  I thought the remote would be too much with all the buttons and the qwerty keyboard, but I was wrong.  It is well laid out with the top section set up to control your most often adjusted features and the bottom set up for internet browsing.  I found two flaws that may or may not bother people.  The controls for adjusting the screen aspect ratio are a few layers deep in the menu system.  That can be a pain if you are changing around from standard definition to high definition a lot.  More significantly, the off-axis viewing is awful.  If you are sitting anywhere near the sweet spot, say an angle of 45 degrees off center, the picture is excellent.  If you go further out than that the picture becomes milky, which I cannot tolerate.  My family doesn't seem to care. I work in TV so it bothers me a lot.  If those two flaws wouldn't bother you, buy one.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "solid sony product quality", "Author": "Charlene C. Trapp", "ReviewID": "R3JKFT884AXR1F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "just purchased the tv this past weekend. based on the two previous reviews, we were a bit hesitant to purchase. however, we tend to be early adopters and i've been looking for a reason to sign up for google tv.the tv really is about 2 components: 1) tv and 2) software. i will call them out separately.the tv is what you expect from sony. solid, designed beautifully, solid metal stand. picture quality is excellent. expected number of inputs. you can't really complain about the tv. we had a samsung tv that had a cheap tuner and wouldn't pick up all the unscrambled digital channels but this tv did. we own other sony's and knew they had a solid tuner built in. we would never buy a samsung again due to the cheap tuner. it's a moot point if you have a cable box, but not everyone wants an additional box.the software. first off, the sony typical UI software is ok. even with our 52 inch and bravia xbr, the UI isn't anything to brag about. though the UI is better than Vizio and other smaller brands, but you are buying a tv, you aren't buying software. Having google tv as the tv UI is refreshing. unfortunately, if you've read anything online about google tv, it's really in the infancy stages. the number of apps are limited. however, this can be overcome by the fact that updates are being pushed out regularly by the google tv team. the software appears to be more responsive against the remote keystrokes than earlier comments, BUT really the UI is a menu that allows you to surf on Google's Chrome browser. I believe the software has a lot of room to grow and that is why i can't give the tv 5 stars yet.so in summaryPro:Solid picture qualityGood TunerGoogle UI better than Sony's previous UICons:Google TV still in infancyRemote looks cool but volume and channel buttons should be biggerOverall, it's solid. if you want something cutting edge, this is a good product. Just need to be aware that the software definitely has room to grow. I have no regrets in purchasing this product.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "TV Internet Access is OK", "Author": "Bill Miller", "ReviewID": "R1YL9AHDPK3NY5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my main TV in the living room to replace a 4 year old Visio LCD TV. I liked having the TV with easy access to the web and free movies. The remote with the full Qwerty Key pad is nice and gives you control to browse the web and enter text. To use the Google TV you must have a Gmail account this is part of the startup setup. It's easiest if you already have an account or set this up from a regular PC first. You'll also need an account with online movie sites to rent online movies. You can view trailers for many movies but as for free movies, other than YouTube there arn't any. Using the remote takes some practice. It takes two hands for many commands. The Google TV menus give you many shortcuts to find TV Channels and related online content, My Channels, Bookmark channels of sites, Movie serices. There is a search button to get quick access to web and channel search. This was one of the better features. There is a Guide to access the Cannel list which requires a subscription I didn't set up, so the guide was useless to me.Cons:The user menus are hard to access and follow. The channel info that displays when changing channels and selecting info is very small and uses light gray text so its very difficult to see. The Now Playing Channel list information shows the Network name, a description of the show and time remaining, but not the Channel numbers. Good information but its hard to tell what channel you were going to until you select the show. The screen settings and volume varied considerably from TV to internet viewing and even when changing from one channel to the next, so much so I was adjusting the settings every time I changed the channel. The picture was either too dull or too saturated. To change the screen settings you have to go through a multi step menu selection first selecting setting using 2 keys [fn]+[Settings], then go to screen setting using a nav menu about 5 - 6 lines down, then select from the items on the screen dialog, Then change the setting. The dialogs are in the center of the screen and cover most of the screen so you can't easily see the effects of changes until closing the menu. There is not an Exit menu command you have to use several steps to access the menu then use the 'Esc' key to back out of the menu the same way you entered it. The buttons on the remote are small. On the 32\" monitor text on web pages is very difficult to read without zooming in, if more than 6 feet away from the TV. The viewing angle is minimal the screen does not look good if you are more than 20 degrees to either side.Bottom Line, It's an alright TV to get on the internet. It's not the best TV for a main room. I returned it to the store after using it for two days and bought a different model, larger 37\" screen that does not have internet. I liked the internet access and may purchase the Sony Blueray Web TV box later if I find a deal on one.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "Rick Stenftenagel \"incubi21\"", "ReviewID": "R1G84A8Z3NO9VC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been in the TV market for roughly a year and had demoed this unit at a best buy at the start. I was liking it then and I love it now that I have purchased it. I spent about 2 hours playing around and setting it up. Initial setup was about 20 minutes.Ratings:1. Remote - 5/5  - I use my android phone and the remote that came with it. They are both accurate and surpassed my expectation.2. Picture - 4.5/5  - I will update this at a later time once I have time to compare to my 46\" Samsung LED.3. Sound - 5/5  - Probably the biggest surprise. I turned on Pandora first thing to have a listen and couldn't believe the sound this TV has. For TV speakers they sound great. It is worth $200 alone.4. Google Software - 4/5  - This could be 5/5 except it is lacking apps with this version. HOWEVER this TV will have the Android market sometime in 2011.5. Web Browser - 5/5  - I haven't come across anything I couldn't play or see yet.6. File Support - 3/5  - I am somewhat depressed that they didn't include native .VOB support. But I knew this and it will continue to get 3/5 until more supported file types are added.7. Overall - 4/5  - I gave this a 4/5 because it needs some improvements. Mainly with the software. The hardware outperforms in almost every area. I think we will be pleasantly surprised when the new  version is out. If you are looking for a beautiful TV that has decent apps this is it. Even better the OTA updates will make the apps even better in 2011. I got my 32 inch for $499 and I feel very satisfied with my decision.8/10/2011UPDATE: So I have had the TV for almost 2 months now. I am not a big stickler on picture quality I am more of a sound guy but I can say the quality is great. I compared the bleed through with a Samsung of similar quality and the Google TV far exceeds it in that arena. As for quality comparison I cannot tell any difference. I still rate it at 4.5 simply because of price and it is superior quality over other LED TV's I have encountered at that range.The only thing that bugs me about this TV is the Amazon Instant video does not prevent the screensaver from coming on.

So far...I love it and think it is a great value at the $499 price. We use it in our master bedroom. We have Time Warner cable but we do not have a set top box in our bedroom, so the coax cable is plugged directly from the wall into the TV. One unexpected highlight is that the TV creates a TV Guide similar to the Guide we have for our main TV that has a set top box. Google TV searches your cable and finds all the channels...interestingly the TV found a few HD channels, too! The Guide can be edited and channels can be turned off/on. Very nice. Also, we really like the bookmarks...you can bookmark anything from regular TV channels (you can edit the name of the bookmark and it shows a channel icon) to websites to apps. Very convenient. Couple downsides are: 1) no Android Market, yet and 2) we couldn't get Club Penguin website to fully load up, so my youngest was not able to play games on the Club Penguin website from the TV. I like the Qriocity VOD app, since it is very similar to VUDU (rent movies with a focus on the latest movie releases in HD or SD). The Netflix app (main reason we bought the TV) works great. We did not have any problems and we watched several hours of TV/movies using the Netflix app this weekend. The screen is beautiful...HD Netflix videos look great as well as the HD TV channels. For a short time I hooked up the PS3 to the TV. Other reviews have discussed the input lag from the PS3 controller, but when playing BF:BC2, visually I didn't notice any lag at all...However, it did FEEL a tiny bit sluggish.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "A hard product to rate.

Fortunate enough to get half off the MSRP.  What a deal!What I like:- Great concept.  A much better integration of internet & TV.- Picture quality is very satisfactory- Setup was not too complicated- The product 'feels' like a quality product- Feature rich- Qwerty keyboard.  Much easier than the 'wii' like input- USB thumbdrive works great- DLNA works as promised- Love that I can create shortcuts to anything- Love that I can bookmark anythingWhat I don't like:- OK.  Who tested the thumb-pad/OSF?  It is horrible.  I cannot believe SONY passed this.- A lot of applications don't work.  E.g. Qriocity.  Even registration failed every attempt.  What gives?- My Transcend 320 GB drive failed to be recognized.- When is the Android Market coming?  It is well past 'early 2011'.- Hard to navigate from one mode to another and back- No way to determine what apps are open & how to close them all at once- So many features feel like 'so close, but ...'.This is a hard product to rate for me, because there are features that I love.

As a net surfer it's kinda bad actually-not that many apps and no google market place as has been promised for some time-not a great picture quality compared to cheaper LED models with it's slow refresh rate and generally poor picture (but the average person won't really care and will think it's ok)All in all, it's not bad but it isn't great or even really good yet. The reality is it's not very user friendly unless you are a first gen. adopter type of person. I don't mind it but \"Mom\" will typically hate it. As a computer, it is crippled heavily by the worst thumb track pad in the entire world. It's so bad that I think I might actually have a broken unit. If the track pad worked well it wouldn't be too bad really. Clicking on a link can take several drunk swipes and usually leads to frustration. It's a mediocre tv, a mediocre computer, and all at a very high price. I would suggest, for the price, buying a cheap LED tv and an Ipad or other cheaper tablet device until this whole internet TV thing catches up to modern technology and combines them. As it is now, it's kinda like going to a fast food restaurant and paying fine dining prices. Sure, the food is decent and it fills you up and it may even be innovative fast food but it's really expensive and it still tastes like fast food.So why am I keeping it? Frankly, when it works, it's pretty cool and the way I hope technology will continue to go. Also, I got it half off because I know someone otherwise I would never have bought it at full price or even 25% off. It's almost ready for prime time but not at MSRP or even close. And yet, I still gave it four stars. Go figure. It is cool though. Plus, if the market place does eventually come to this TV, it could be a game changer for it. In the end, it needs a better \"mouse\" a bit more processing power and the google market place to make it worth it's asking price.  Oh, and maybe a faster refresh rate for gaming and watching sports.  It doesn't do well with gaming at all.

The mouse is not really good on the control, but thank god for the d-pad.The only thing I want to say is that it doesn't support game mode, so if you have a PS3, you might experience a lag.  Since it is a 60hz television, I didn't find that much of a lag but you will notice it if you have played in game mode on a regular LCD/LED TV that supports it.

It came down to this one and the Vizio with apps tv as well. I'm glad I choose this one. First off let me say how beautiful this tv looks even when it's not turned on. If I could compare it to something I would say it looks like a 32 inch iPad. The screen sits behind an all glass front. So you can clean the screen with ease. Once you turn this beauty on its a gem. The picture is stunning and if you don't like the Sony logo that glows on the bottom of the tv while it's on you can turn it off. The picture is vibrant and bright and I watched Planet Earth on it on Blu-Ray and I must say it was stunning. Did I mention it has Google TV built in? I just received the 2.0 update this morning and have not had a lot of time to really mess around with it but I can't wait to get a little more hands on with it. It has Apps, and lots of streamable content from Netflix, Amazon, and Craclke to name a few. Pandora is built in and many more apps available and many more coming in following months. The Chrome browser is great and with Flash built in you can go just about anywhere on the web. The remote is a full keyboard that is about the size of a game controller it does take some getting used to and it is not backlit my only real complaint. I don't game so I don't know about the lag issue that gamers are experiencing with this tv. I use it to watch TV, surf the web, stream movies and shows and look at pictures of my kids from a flash drive with one of the 4 USB ports.

Personally, I LOVE this television. I think if you use a color calibration DVD or even Google the settings for it (which I did) it puts off an amazing picture.

It works like it should.  Right out of the box It automatically did an update. This  took about 20 minutes with the set up. After all of this you get to the your own connections. I just hooked up my Direct tv with no problems, Panasonic blu ray, and finally my PS3.  Image quality is very good its not excellent and silky smooth like most of the expensive Sony's 120hz 0r 240hz, If you want that silky smooth artificial look I recommend that you don't get this TV. The internet wireless and wired connection works flawlessly with netflix with no problems. The only thing that annoys me is youtube.  The problem is when you stream videos there is no buffering and depending on your connection or traffic to the site the video stops until it downloads and starts to play again where it left off. Not that big of a deal this only happens when you make it full screen, when you do this it streams it in 1080p or 720p depending on the video you want to watch, the video in full screen looks very good.  I have also read that people have problems with PS3 gaming with some \"lag\". I'm here to tell you that I do not have this problem. I have no lag or problems when I play my F1 and GT5 games. Anyone that plays these game knows how FAST the graphics are on them especially F1.  Granted its not a 120hz tv but a 60Hz, with this in mind my game play looks very good I know there's better out there.

Seems 'somebody'(Sony or Goggle?) didn't pay for those rights or something.

Read on to learn why.Google TV - A total bust, and from someone who is an avid Google user (Gmail, Calendar, Docs, ect) that was hard to admit. What's busted? The concept is great on paper, add apps to TVs & have a browser. In real life however, you get something else. Content providers like Hulu, Fox.com & CBS.com all blocking the browser. Hulu refusing to release a Hulu Plus App for it. Speak of Apps, there are none, other then Netflix & Pandora. Currently there are so few, and they are of such low quality/random developers. There isn't even an official Facebook App. I mean, it is beyond spartan, there isn't anything name brand. Just over priced 2D Live Wallpapers. **I purchased my set after the Honeycomb Update was released btw**Picture Quality - The unit suffers from two critical flaws LIMITED viewing angles & uneven screen lighting. While I was fully expecting the latter problem (I had researched the model a bit), the back lighting isn't that even on the panel and will be noticed in dark scenes; however, I was completely shocked to find a 2011 TV with top of the line features using such a poor quality LCD panel. There is no way this panel is an IPS-LCD (like Panasonic & Vizio use, which ensures wide viewing angles) and it shows, if you are Not sitting RIGHT in front of its \"sweet spot\", the colors drop off and start to grey out on you. Maybe if I was putting this at the foor of a two person bed I wouldn't care ... but I am not. And seats to the left and right have terrible views of this thing. There is just no excuse for this. O, I almost forgot ... there is another issue. There is input lag. Yep gamers. RUN AWAY. This will make a TERRIBLE computer screen thanks to its terrible input lag.Sound - I thought for a small TV it sounded great, but it might have been from the room acoustics.Remote - Bulky and cheap feeling, in the picture it felt so solid, but in real life? I wouldn't expect this thing to last one drop on a solid wood or tile floor without the plastic cracking. Typing on it was lack luster as well, the buttons do not have a satisfying click when you push them. It uses RF, which is a plus.***BOTTOM LINE: It has cool features (RF remote & IR Blasters build IN!), but a cheap panel (no matter HOW nice the bezel & stand looks) married with Google TV (No meaningful App), create a TV that on paper sounds amazing, in real life under performs. I purchased it on sale for $400. It was returned within 15 days. I am going with the Vizio XVT323SV that Amazon sells for a little more ($480).

The only other \"complaint\" (but not really) that I have is that in all the photos I've seen for it showing the home screen on the TV or it's operations are not true. The actual home screen and such look nothing like that but are instead set up in a \"tool-bar-at-the-bottom\" for favorite apps and there's a special button for \"all apps\" as well for the rest.

I have two Bravia sets, one a 40\" 1080p that is four years old and another 26\" 720p set (6 years old) for the bedroom that this would replace. My current Bravia sets look better than this.Viewing angles are \"horrible\". I saw this in a post but thought that for a bedroom TV it wouldn't matter. It does to me. The faces turn gray after you move off center. Weird. The colors do not pop like my Bravia sets. The picture seems fuzzy and not sharp. I tried changing some settings but can't get past the viewing angle and the fact that it seems as though Sony did not put the same Sony features into this lineup.

Also, the TV and stand are pictured slightly angled backwards.....this is for a reason. You can't put the display in an upright position. You can tilt it backwards but not fully upright. Weird. Our TV sits on a tall dresser which is above eye level when watching in bed.....my TV is facing the ceiling.

The set up was pretty easy, but since the product had been out for a while, the updates took about twenty to thirty minutes.Once I got it up and running, it was great! In fact, I would go for days without booting up my regular computer because I could do so much on just my TV. There are a few things you cannot watch, such as full episodes of certain, if not most shows, but you can watch individual clips. The best thing was, I used it for hours on end to watch video lectures, which ended up saving me about one year of classes.Let me warn you about the remote. The mouse feature IS MADDENING! I eventually bought a back up remote with a mouse feature that works like a dream. Trust me, its something you'll want to consider if you buy this product.In spite of the minor glitches, everything was great, until the wi-fi stopped working. When I called Sony tech support, they went through a few things, one of which was to restore factory settings. Still no wi-fi. They eventually told me to plug in the Ethernet cable. When I told them I couldn't do that because the cable was in the other room, they didn't have a solution. I eventually had to get a new router, and voila! wi-fi was back! For one week, and then it was down again. Basically, the wi-fi is back again, but I don't know for how long. When I Google the problem, they say the remedy is to reset your router, which I have yet to figure out.So if you're a little above average tech savvy, you'll be OK with this.

I already own a Samsung Smart T.V. and wanted something similar for my bedroom. First, the setup was a breeze. I was up and running in minutes. The picture is not quite as good as my Samsung but that may have more to do with the Samsung being twice the size of this Sony Google T.V.Next, I did not think I would like the remote; it was different however I quickly began to get a greater feel for it. The touch pad acts exactly as the keypad on my laptop does. I can even let my daughter play games on the t.v. that she can't even play on my Samsung tablet! Soon I found this T.V. to be AMAZING! Everything I can do on my computer, I can do on this television. I LOVE that I can seamlessly connect to my Amazon video's as well as Netflix or a host of other streaming applications.There are 4 USB slots and I believe 2 for the HDMI's. The USB connections work wonderfully, allowing me to download movies and such to a USB then connect to my television for viewing. No more burning DVD's for me. The other quality I truly appreciate is it's ability to connect to any one of my other media devices; XBOX, computers etc. and have media content shared directly to the television. I do not have to burn discs or connect to a USB unless I so desire because my television locates devices for me. I used that feature on this T.V. before even realizing I had the same option via All Share with my Samsung!I purchased some speakers for it this year, only to enhance the sound quality for action movies and music and to give the built in t.v. speakers a break. Perhaps those who are dissatisfied with their purchase received a bad apple because overall I have NO complaints with this television. I have never had connection issues, I appreciate the apps and accessibility to Google Play although I never use it. The timers and pre-loaded apps are a nice touch too. I have since recommended this television to many others and likely will give it to my daughter soon and purchase another larger one for myself.

Had this TV for 5 months now, and I guess I can share my experience with it. I like the TV a lot because of its capability of installing android apps. Youtube and Netflix works flawlessly. The built-in chrome browser, which also supports flash, is fantastic. My family watch online videos all the time with it. The picture quality is fine, but the viewing angle is not very good. If you are watching from 45 degree off the center, the image becomes milky. So if the viewing angle is critical to you, don't buy this TV. The included qwerty remote does what it supposes to do, and it is not difficult to figure out how to use it. Even my 7-yr kid manages to use it. The HD tuner works fine, and actually picks up more channels than my Vizio LCD TV.In terms of Apps, it is still limited. Although you can download other apps in .apk from other sites, not all can be installed or working correctly on this TV. So you are still limited to the ones showing up in the google play store on this TV.

The picture is sharp and clear, the apps included are wonderful, and the response with Google Chrome web browsing is remarkable.

The only issue with this product is that unless you are using a dedicated cable box with HDMI outputs ... (if you are using cable), there is no way to get a signal.  Only a dedicated HDMI cable box will give you an HDMI output.  My former Dish Newtwork configuration gave me a cable output (coaxial) ... which I was told by Sony was not supported in this this TV.  My options then were to buy a cable-HDTV converter ... (costing $100-299), or order a dedicated separate box for my bedroom. Our best option will cost an additional $120/yr. with a $100 set-up fee for a new Dish Network receiver and HD service.The installation and configuration of this product was seamless, with 15 minutes passing between my configuration and surfing the web.  Except for the fact that I have no real TV ... until my new dedicated HDTV box arrives, I am supremely happy with this product.

I got mine shipped and paid for $480, a modest price for a 32'' fully loaded with web entertainment.Set up is straight forward and a fairly simple. The hardware feels solid, I've always enjoyed SONY products for that reason and the remote is really nice too.The OS has soo much potential, seriously this was one of the biggest selling points to me, android on a tv. Unfortunately is very badly implemented, one tab scrolls up/down while the next scrolls left/right. There's no unified interface across the system, some apps don't even work (give some server error) since there's only about 20 apps the 3 or 4 tabs in the OS all have the same things in it which seems pointless. And some features are only available if you have Dish Network.The picture quality is also just ok, there's nothing really bad about it but the colors don't really pop either and if you plan on watching fast action, 60Hz ain't gonna do it so bare that in mind. But I knew that even before buying this set, I also have a LG 47SL90 47-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTV, Glossy Blackso I've been comparing them a lot. And while the LG offers pretty good viewing angles, the SONY falls very short, watching it from 5ft to the side blends the colors, reds look like light oranges and the whole thing is unwatchable.This isn't really a problem for me though since I'm looking for a bedroom set.My biggest problem with the display is the horrific input lag. I'm not exaggerating here either, look it up on youtube, tv reviewers or the android forums. Every gamer out there that bought this set is either very upset or like me have/plan of returning it (I'm the latter one). refresh rate will not help you in this case either, as stated in the SONY site: \"Some users may experience a slight lag or delay in response time when connecting the Internet TV device to a game console. This is a natural result of the advanced processing circuitry in the Internet TV device. This is normal operation.\"[...]So I'll be returning this set, using it as a monitor is also just as frustrating due to the lag and there are plenty of TV's that have web capability comparable to this one even without android. Shame really, so much potential yet fall short on the most important aspect any tv should have, picture quality and performance, everything else should be second. Seems the makers got it backwards on this one and didn't even finish the product.BTW I love the look of the tv as well as the remote, really a sexy looking tv even if my LG is mucH thinner, this one still looks pretty good.

Google tv was supposed to be the new standard for cutting edge viewing bringing the internet, tv, and cable together to make an unprecedented and new viewing experience to people like me, it delivered on a small level, but nothing compared to the hype surrounding it when it came out. Now. already, not even a full 6months after getting the tv, google tv 2.0 has been released and those of us who were foolish enough to get in at the beginning are sitting on a dinosaur! I have this one and a logitech revue/google tv device both running the earlier platform, logitech bailed on the entire thing, barely support t, and stopped making it, sony just moved on to 2.0 and those of us with the original have an inferior product at best! Vizio came out with the new co=pilot, shipping on 8/14 for $99.00, I pre-ordered one to replace my piece of crap logitech revue, and the sony tv is another story! I paid too much to just replace this one, and I;m pissed off that we had no warning, no compensation from sony, and with 2.0 very little interest in helping those of us that jumped in from the start! We were told that many upgrades and improvements would be made to the gtv #1 platform, and while some updates still roll out here and there, they are minor ones, and not even worthy of mentioning, sony seems committed to doing more with the new platform, but they seemed sincere with the first platform! I'm disgusted and will never buy another logitech product as long as I live, and sony will have to prove to me that they give a crap about those of us with the original or they will be the next company I boycott! Buyers beware, while gtv is a great idea in theory, it still has a long way to go, and b4 jumping in with both feet, make sure your getting a device that will stay relevant, and continue being upgraded and supported. Sony don't do what logitech did to us, and vizio I hope you know what your doing getting into the gtv set top business, it could be awesome, but will it be awesome?

The tv looks beautiful.  The picture is pretty darn good considering the price and its features.  At the price point with basically a smart phone built into it, I knew they would settle low on some of the tvs functions and display ability(response time etc).  The setup takes about ten minutes with pairing the remote and getting the soft/firmware update and getting to connect to my wireless router took seconds.  After that you restart the tv and it installs the updates which takes another 10 minutes.  I bought this tv for a few features-streaming netflix, having the internet right there at all times, and streaming from my PCs.  The other attractive feature was all the new apps that would be available early '11....still waiting on that part.  There is little to no news on new apps or android market place, only that its open to developers to work on.  So netflix works great, google works pretty well, but streaming from my home PCs is hit or miss so far.  I could get it to find one of the two computers, but that may be my settings which I am working to resolve.  Once connected to the one computer I can browse and find media but many videos did not play at first.  Keep in mind, this tv supports many codecs.  After turning off the tv and starting over I got it to play the files.  I also connected an external HDD to the tv's USB port and it worked significantly better than streaming through my network, of course.  The remote is where trouble starts.  It feels pretty natural to me because its ergonomically similar to a Playstation controller.  However there are so many buttons its difficult to use in the dark.  Aside from tv on/off, volume, channel, and the navigation d-pad and mouse pad thingy, it is useless in the dark.  That being said, it is fine for just watching tv or movies.  Using the internet with this remote is useless in the dark.  This is not so bad, though because the app to use your iphone or android phone as remote is supposedly working.  Not sure if you can use it for all the functions the included tv remote controls, but if does, it would be better in a dark setting.  So, overall the tv works very well as a tv and media player.  But I do not think its quite the tv google and sony are advertising it to be.  It has limited apps and a lack of news on future apps.  For me, its a darn good price on a tv that suits my needs perfectly.

Yes, you can easily surf the internet within Google CHROME and Sony NSX-32GT1 comes preloaded with a bunch of apps (Netflix, Amazon VOD, Crackle and dozens of others, you probably will never use) and yet, I've found at least 9 (nine) websites out of all my favs, where their videos are NOT compatible with Sony Google TV.

It is more of feeling. like when you really love some product and you can't live without it. But, the opposite feeling. I got this TV for the sound quality. I am hearing impaired and the Sony has the best sound. I went to the Sony store, I did not know what to get. I had two choices in the size I needed. One was Google and the other had no Google, but cost more. I got the Google TV, because it was cheaper. There was a reason for this.. The remote does work very well. I had to get a key board that cost about 100 dollars, I hate the key board. You need to be able to type letters into it to set up. At first in connected to the modem, but now it won't connect. It wants my modem to be located about a foot away from the TV. It has no range at all. I don't want my computer in the same room with my TV. In the brief time I used the TV for the internet, it was horrible. It is as slow as dial up. You have to log into all your websites slowing using the keyboard and most sites won't work. You have to relog into all your sites on your computer when you stop using the Google TV internet. You got back to the TV and you have to once again login. Everything you need to do on line, they make you log in now. It does not store passwords. The door to the battery compartment door  won't stay closed and the batteries fall out. I took it back to the Sony store and they would not give me a refund. I am spoiled because Amazon is so great. But, I could not get this TV on Amazon, because I was afraid of the shipping costs if I wanted to return it. I could not  see buying it on Amazon, but I should have. The key board was not offered on Amazon. I am warning you  guys always use Amazon if possible, they will give you a refund.Even if my computer broke and I could not get a new one, I would never use the Google TV for the internet. When it refused to connect it asked me for the date and time constantly, because it would not connect. It would not accept a me entering the date and time. A big error box pops up in front your face when you try to watch TV, demanding the date and time. You can make it go away, but it pops up again and again. I told them I just wanted a TV without Google at all. I have TiVo, I don't need a Google TV, I just want a screen for my TiVo and DVR player. I should have spent more and got the non Google TV. So, now it's not connected to the internet at all. If the dog touches the remote, there is a side button that turns on the TV full blast in the middle of the night when I am sleeping. I have to hid the remove from the dog. You are better off unplugging it at night. If you watch TV for more than a hour, it tries to shut down. You are watching a movie, at the most critical moment, it sends a message, I am shutting off to save power because you are not watching TV. It is like being logged off of internet radio due to lack of activity. So, you need to select the most power draining options on that, to prevent it from ruining your evening. If you can't find your remote it will shut off. So, they did a software update and they wanted to know how I liked my Goggle TV after the update. I filled out the survey giving it the lowest possible rating. I said, I am not even going to try to use it with the new update, and I could not anyway because I would have to move my modem into the  living room. I would have to called Astound and have them move the cable again. I had to move it out of the living room, because having a TV and a computer in the same room was too much of a power drain. I should have the whole house rewired, but that costs a lot also, so I don't do it. I can't have too much power on anyone grind in my house, hence the computer is not in the same room as the TV. So, I don't use the Google TV feature, and it an ok TV, as just a screen with sound. I guess that is worth one star.
