{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very satisfied with picture.", "Author": "Big Sur Steve", "ReviewID": "RYCE2X2OV09WV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We recently replaced our ten year old Sharp 27\" CRT TV with a flat screen.  At first, we picked up a 37\" Vizio smart TV VIZIO M370SL 37-Inch 120Hz Edge Lit Razor LED LCD HDTV with VIZIO Internet Apps (Black), but were dissatisfied with the picture quality in addition to several freeze ups which required unplugging, then replugging in of the set, to get it working again.  While the Vizio has many appealing features, it simply didn't work all that well.After more reading and looking at various HD TV's,  we ended up returning the Vizio and purchasing the Samsung UN40EH5050 for about the same price.  We gave up the smart aspect of the TV in the process, but replaced this short coming with Apple TV Apple TV MD199LL/A [NEWEST VERSION] which cost about $100.  In addition, Apple TV offers mirroring, which I consider a major benefit.  The Vizio had no mirroring capabilities. Our total investment was a bit more by going with Samsung, but we gained 3 inches of diagonal viewing area in addition to a far superior picture with the the advantage of Apple mirroring .The sound quality was a pleasant surprise as well.  While I liked the thin design of the Vizio, this design also made the speakers sound tinny.  The Samsung is thicker, but leaves room for a sound box around the speakers . This helps eliminate the tinny sound and we find the Samsung's sound,  acceptable. When we want a bit more sound boost, we use our Sony RDP-X200iP sound dock Sony RDPX200iP Dock for iPod which I have connected to the Samsung's \"audio out\" jack in back.  The other peripherals we have connected to the Samsung are Apple TV and the Sony BOP-BX2  Blu Ray player Sony\u00ae Blu-ray DiscTM Player BDP-BX2, which are cabled into the HDMI ports.To eliminate the need for multiple controllers, we use the L5 controller L5 Universal Remote Control for iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch we found on Amazon.  It fits onto my iPhone or iPad and consolidates our five controllers into one unit.Pros:-picture quality-sound-build quality-thin bezel design-ease of use-light weight for ease of moving-energy efficiency- would work well with solar energy source-value for priceCons:-only 2 HDMI ports-relative thickness of set compared to some of the others-no 3DWe don't consider not having built-in smart TV capabilities, a \"Con\" in our particular case.  None of the smart TV's produced, interface with our Apple devices like Apple TV does.If you are looking for a high quality HD TV with great picture and decent sound, it's hard to beat this Samsung, especially for the price.  We picked ours up at COSTCO for $529Here are the picture settings I use:Standard mode-backlight: 16-contrast: 90-brightness: 54-sharpness:30-color: 60-tint: G55/R45Advanced settings-color space: native-white balance:  red balance 28, everything else 25-gamma: 0-dynamic contrast: high-black tone:dark-flesh tone: +3-motion lighting: offPicture Options-color tone: warm 1-size: 16:9-LED Motion Plus: offThese were set using a mirrored image of a photo from my iPad to the Samsung.  Through trial and error, the Samsung settings were changed to best fit with the image on my iPad.*************************************************************************************************************************************************************Update 11/30/13TV works great.  No problems, whatsoever.  Picture remains great, and no need for further adjustments of any type.

True to most Samsung TV's, this one especially.There is a wide viewing angle. Colors don't distort whether you're laying down below it, or standing up near it.Sound can be setup to be sufficient and surprisingly loud.The USB port allows playing videos, music and albums. - I've tried playing some .AVI files I had on my computer and it worked perfectly, exactly as I hoped.No point in a DVD player.Thin BezelExtremely low power, even by LED standards (meaningful on the island I'm on where power isn't cheap).Zero banding (where you can see where the light-source is -- for instance LED edge-lit TV's generally have this, where in dark scenes you'll see a little white light on the perimeter of the TV.SO DAMN CHEAP for the quality of television (and menus)CONS:2 HDMI ports. That's pretty pathetic, but I guess how they make the pricepoint.Thicker then an LED edge-lit TV.I haven't had a chance to play with all the functions on the TV and run a DVD to configure the colors just right.My feeling is that this TV is a great deal for the price, as you don't need more then 2 things plugged into it and 40\" is enough size for you. For me those are two things i could do without so it's perfect.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic HDTV", "Author": "Razzle", "ReviewID": "R21V4S1951O97Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Saw this Samsung UN40EH5050F 40\" Class 1080P LED LCD HDTV at Costco with a nice instant rebate and read reviews here.  Glad we found the review that described the different screen Versions...we searched through the boxes at Costco to get the best version number of this particular model.When we got this TV all connected at home (setup was a breeze), the TV exceeded our expectations.  Fantastic image!  Very nice upgrade to our home mini-theater experience, now that we recently also purchased the Sony BDP-BX18/S185 Blu-ray Player with HDMI cable (Black) (we love that, too!).We also find the sound to be very good on the Samsung 40\" HDTV (especially since the 24\" Vizio we had before had horribly tinny sound).  But for movies, we still prefer using a line-in via RCA to an older model AIWA stereo amp. & speakers.  And we are really glad this Samsung TV has RCA ports...some of the other HDTV's we saw did not have RCA ports.We also really like that this HDTV does not have all the excessive bells and whistles of more expensive models, yet does offer superb functionality for what we need it to do....mainly, DVD & Blu-ray movies, and Satellite TV.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just an Amazing HGTV!", "Author": "JimBob", "ReviewID": "R35096OXR1NDBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for a Samsung unit purchased at Costco on Feb. 1st. In my research, a review covering this model (but different screen size) revealed different screens manufacturers were used by Samsung in production; see here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083KGXC8/ref=cm_cd_asin_lnk by \"HopefullyThoughtful\". I searched the local inventory at Costco and found the top rated screen (Samsung) in the minority of inventory - only two of probably forty sets. Out of the box, the set was okay, but I thought could be better if adjusted properly. The website: [...], provided an easy way to correctly adjust the set. I downloaded the calibration file, then burned to a standard DVD, in my case. This must be used in a Blu-Ray player. Note there is a nice video, which explains the process, once downloaded and burned to-disk. The picture is so amazing now! I'm glad I took the time to 1. do the research and 2. adjust it properly. Other reviews comment on the audio (which is adequate for most programming). My unit is connected to a stereo system via stereo mini-jack to RCA connection for an improved aural experience. Needless to say, I'm very happy with this purchase!To add \"smart features\" and minimize connections, I upgraded my DVD to a Sony Blu-Ray model BDP-S390 (non-3D). The functions of the \"smart\" attributes have yet to be discovered, but as a player works really well.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "samsung  tv 40 inch", "Author": "Martin Bisk", "ReviewID": "R3QVT2V50M8T19", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I checked very carefully before I bought this samsung  tv and I am very satisfied.I also  own a 55 inch samsung  which gives a very good picture.

Peters", "ReviewID": "R229STPFK1SV1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got this tv at Costco too, and got a spectacular price. Originally had bought it but luckily saw that there are different makers of the screen per other amazon reviews, and our original was made by Sharp. The next day we took back the unopened box and were super lucky to find ONE that was made by Samsung (TSO3?). We made sure that the version code on the actual tv matched the one on the box. To make matters even better, the box on the new tv had been opened by Costco because they had planned to use it as a demo and so the price had been lowered to $395-- but they never actually took the tv out of the box as evidenced by the fact that every component was in the original sealed packaging! So we got this for a spectacular price. We also bought the additional square trade warranty for $30, which added 3 years of warranty to the 2 years already provided by Costco, so now we have a 5 year warranty total.This afternoon we set up the tv and it was not difficult. The sound is quite impressive compared to our previous Sylvania flat screen, and we really like that the border around the picture is minimized compared to some others we've seen. Also a good feature is that the screen is not shiny and glossy, so there are no glares from lighting showing up on the screen. We have no interest in \"smart tv\" so this was a good choice for our needs. The picture is nice and clear, the colors look great, and I don't see ghosting. This is a very nice size too. Our living room is very large and this seems to be perfect for our lifestyle. My husband and I are extremely satisfied.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "This TV is PURPLE!!", "Author": "A.
