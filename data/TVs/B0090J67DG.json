{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The light bleed is unacceptable.", "Author": "Anthony Pantliano \"The Photo Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3A1QTI7JEM877", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Westinghouse 32\" LED LCD TV is affordably priced, but excessive light bleed keeps this from being a good set.Design wise the Westinghouse is very simple and stylish.  It has a dark gray bezel that looks almost like a brushed metal.  On the bottom edge of the set is a clear plastic strip where the power light shines down on the right side.  The base of the set is done in a piano black, but it does not swivel, a disappointment.  At it's thickest point it's about 2\" deep.  Overall, it's a nice look, and doesn't look cheap at all.  Indeed, the materials used, and the high quality construction, belie the TV's low price.  I found no dead pixels on the set either.  The included remote is pretty basic, but well assembled and has dedicated buttons for the various inputs.  There is no printed manual included, just one on a CD.Assembling the set is easy.  You simply slide the base onto the bottom and use the two included screws to secure it in place.  It's a job that's easily done by one person as the TV is light and manageable.  Speaking of, the box that the TV comes in is also quite small and easy for one person to carry.  After attaching the base, you just have to plug in the power cord.  The power cord, unfortunately, has a power brick attached to it.Features and connections are very basic.  There is no internet connectivity for the Westinghouse to stream content online, nor is the set 3D capable.  The resolution is 720p, not full HD at 1080p, but for a set of this size, that's hardly objectionable, and you would be hard pressed to notice the difference unless you were really close to the TV.  The connections are as follows; 2 HDMI, 1 Composite, 1 VGA, 1 RF, 1 Digital Audio Out, and 1 Analog Audio Out.When turning on the TV it takes a couple of seconds to respond, which can be disconcerting at first.  The menu system is very easy to navigate, but has very few options, just your basic picture and sound controls and a few odds and ends.  There is no timer to turn the TV on, but there is a sleep timer.  Disappointingly, the picture settings are not input independent.  Also, don't accidentally hit the return button while in the menu system as it will start the set-up wizard and all of your picture settings will be erased.Picture quality is where this set falters, however.  First let's start with the positives.  The colors are rich and vibrant, and detail, especially for HD content, is sharp and crisp.  There is no discernable motion blur and the viewing angle is very wide.  The biggest problem this set has is light bleed.  The edges of the set, when a dark scene is being displayed, are always bright and whitish.  Unfortunately, it's very distracting and ruins any details that are in shadows.  Moreover, the bleeding isn't even uniform, so parts of the screen are worse than others.  When you're watching a bright scene, everything looks great, but as soon as the light levels drop, the Westinghouse reveals its major weakness.  This is definitely not a TV you want to buy if you have a critical eye.  Lastly, there doesn't seem to be a discernable difference between the \"warm\" and \"cool\" color temperature picture settings.Sound quality of the Westinghouse is good, and while bass is weak, when the volume is turned up it gets very loud.  There should be no problem hearing the TV in a noisy environment.All in all...a good price, decent features, but disappointing light bleed.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the budget", "Author": "Nuknuk", "ReviewID": "R1R8Z39NMNUEAJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a lot of TV for the price.  Flat TVs used to cost a lot of money just a few years ago.  I still remember paying eight hundred dollars for a Vizio that was only a few more inches bigger than this.  Westinghouse is not known for making TVs which may discourage you from purchase.  But the company itself  is an American institution, a technological giant that even built some of the most advanced nuclear facilities around the world.  Flat screens are also made by just a handful of well known makers who sell them to other companies like Westinghouse.We are using this in our master bedroom.  We have an average size room so the size is just perfect.  I have connected it to an AppleTV hooked up through an HDMI cable and audio passing through the TV using an optical cable to a pair of powered speakers.The resolution is only 720P but for a 32-inch screen, you don't see much difference unless you are very particular, in such case you probably looking for a higher priced/ higher end models anyway.  It has a wide angle of viewing that my wife still enjoys watching even doing ironing on the corner of our room.Pros:- great for the budget- wide angle of viewing- lightweight, easy to move aroundCons:- picture quality is OK.- cheaper construction, everything is plastic- You will need to go to westinghousedigital.com website if you want to install an antenna; you have to or you cannot start to scan channels.  You will be required to select the model number and type the serial number.- no tilt, you would need a mount to change the vertical angle.

Great picture, really thin frame.  What more could you ask for?  I've spend a couple days paying attention issues with the picture, really searching for anything.  There really isn't much to complain about.  I was a little concerned about a 60hz refresh rate being an issue, but it's refresh rate, even in action scenes is really, really good.  No complaints there.  The dark is very dark, giving the right feel of depth.  Great picture, the audio is pretty good to.  The audio is not top notch, but perfectly acceptable.  Who really uses the audio directly from a TV anyway?  The menu selection and remote could use a little fine tuning, but noting that would upset a normal person.  I've got this TV in my kitchen and I can't really figure out how to turn it on without the remote.  I haven't tried exhaustively to figure it out, jut saying that it's not intuitive (for me anyway).

I had to go to Westinghouse's website, type in the TV's serial number and model, receive a PIN, and enter that PIN on the TV. Just thought it was an unnecessary setup step. It's a one time thing however, and you are not required to do it ever again (I think).For the price I think it's decent. I've had it for only a month, so I can't speak about longevity, but I've connected a leaf antenna to it, and I think the picture quality is fine. Definitely a good for casual viewing. You can use it for regular movies, but you might also want to move that couch a little closer since the size isn't that great.It comes with a standard 1366x768 resolution, so it's fine for connecting an HTPC to it and be able to use the Windows desktop when needed.Other than that, I haven't noticed any light bleed like the other reviewer.

The customer support sucks.  My advice is unless your time and frustration is worth a few $$, SKIP THIS BRAND UNTIL THEY CAN FIX THERE SUPPORT.  The other joke is the support site.

It's not a samsung but for a 2nd TV in my kitchen it's exactly what I needed.  semi name brand 32\" LED TV for under $200 is a good deal IMO.I have 2 Westinghouse 42\" LCD TV's as my daily living room and bedroom units for almost 5 years now still running strong with no issues so this brand has proved itself to be good to me.Mounted it on a articulating arm wall bracket with no issues.  I could not believe how little this TV weighs,  it's super light which is great if your hanging on a wall with not much support or having to carry it around for presentations.Easy set up,  nice remote,  good picture.  Sound is Ok per most Flat screens but works fine for my kitchen.Additional comments added on April 22nd 2013:  The TV picture is still great but there seems to be a problem with the sound where the TV sound will just turn off randomly.  The issue started shortly afer I got it and I would say it happens about once every hour or two where hte sound goes off almost like you hit the mute button.  The TV needs to be turned off and back ion for the sound to reset and be back on.

B", "ReviewID": "R3E0XE9U80QEKH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Until I saw this TV I didn't know Westinghouse made TVs and technicaly they don't.  This TV is a product of Westinghouse Digital LLC under license to Westinghouse.  The Westinghouse Digital website seems to imply without actually saying it that this TV is an economical/budget TV, and it is.  The TV is manufactured in China.We got this for a second smaller bedroom.Setup:The TV is protected by a film, like all others, but when you pull off the film on the bottom plastic around the screen two things happen.  First is it tears so you can only get a little piece off at a time but more important, second, the plastic trim pulls loose from the TV itself so you have to be very careful.  The base is also covered by a film, I only mention this because it really show fingerprints.There is NO printed manual, only a DVD.  At first we didn't think much of this but after not being able to find where to plug in the AC adaptor (I admit this is the first TV I have had were you plug the electric cord into an adaptor and the adaptor into the TV, like you do for a printer).  We found why this DVD only manual is a problem.  You have to go to another room and view the DVD on another TV or in our case a computer.  Then one person reads the manual in one room and shouts to the other what to do in the room with the TV.  There are a few mistakes in the manual, e.g., \"use four screws to secure the base to the TV\", however there are only two holes to do so and only two screws supplied, the AC/DC adaptor input connection instructions refer to numbers that are not in the manual drawings, ditto for where the inputs are.TV set-up includes the now usual:  language, time zone and input (and that's all).  A menu option will get you to adjust the picture, audio and son on.Picture:I am comparing this TV to a Samsung Plasma, which of course cost about 10 times as much so not fair and a Panasonic LCD mid-priced TV.  I'm not a techno-geek so don't measure lumins, hue/saturation, etc. (and to be honest no geek would probably buy this TV), I just adjust the picture to what I like. When you turn on the TV there is a noticeable lag before the picture comes on, longer than our plasma, this takes getting used to.  The picture isn't bad but the first thing I noticed is the picture doesn't seem to \"pop\" like the other TVs, it is kind of flat.  Also not nearly as sharp as other TVs, just doesn't have the razor sharpness you are used to.  The colors are fairly rich and balanced. So far there isn't any blurring or atrifacts.  Sound is OK for a bedroom, again no one interested in serious sound would buy this TV.One thing I did notice, if you are close to the TV you can see the pixels.  I realize I'd never watch TV that close, I'm taking about 2 feet away while walking past and you just don't see that in the other TVs any more.Summary:This TV is an very inexpensive budget TV and if you are realistic about what you are getting it should work for you.  However, if you are used to a upper level TV you will be disappointed in the picture.  Good TV for a second bedroom, but not really for your main viewing or even a master bedroom.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Janice K.

I think paying $250 for this TV is too much compared to what else is on the market.

Not the most amazing ever but still can watch a nice movie on it. I don't see you able to tell too much different, except maybe from the nicest TVs on the market.-Size-I don't have a huge room and, as most people said, a bedroom with this is about right. It may be undersized in most living rooms now, but great for a bedroom-slim-It is much slimmer than many budget TVs I see. It looks fairly good too, thinner edge from end of screen to border, kind of a wavy black front trim which looks neat too.Cons:-Takes about 5 seconds to turn on. Doesn't bother me though, it has a red light which comes on before the picture so you know it is going.-Standard definition is not very good. My old tube TV had a better picture on regular TV. I think this is more that I have a bad signal compounded by a cheap VCR causing this. Sound is fine and the images don't blur. There is almost film noise on the screen this way. Noticed no problem if I use the HD input though.I would buy this again. For the price it is totally worth it. I have had it a little under a month so can't comment on durability. And lastly the light bleed many complain about was nothing to me. I think this varies more TV to TV. Mine has only the littlest on the edges, almost evenly. It is nothing worse than many TVs I see.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV with a great price", "Author": "dantheman", "ReviewID": "RLJISNLMNJNHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is MORE THAN i expected.

He has nothing but praise for it and he is very picky when it comes to electronics.  It has been 100 percent reliable.  The colors are good and there is no blurring with the action.  It is sleek and energy efficient.  The remote is easy to use.  Probably the major weakness is that the sound quality is only average.  Last night my wife and I watched Netflix movies on it as my daughter's birthday party had taken over our living room.  I was impressed by the picture quality.  If you compare this TV to units costing much more you will notice a qualitative difference, especially in sound quality, but not by much considering the price difference.  The LEDs have lasted a year so I would think they are going to last their full potential of 30K hours since they have not been defective thus far.  LEDs are also more energy efficient so if you are off grid or have alternative energy this may be a consideration in your purchase.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent 2nd or 3rd TV", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1GD470DUUKLSG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV was purchased for a home office and video game console. Overall the TV performs fine and at @ $179 was worth the price. As one other person noted, there is some noticeable light bleed. On my particular unit the light bleed is at the bottom of the screen in 2 places. The light bleed is not noticeable when anything other than black is projected. I could not see the defect when watching a show or playing a video game other than when in transition between scenes.The only other complaint I have is that I am unable to find a code to work with my Directv remote. Searching the web others have posted the same issue. I am satisfied with this TV at the sale price. If I had paid more the tv would probably be exchanged due to the light bleedAesthetically the set is very nice. It is very thin and light. It should be easy to mount to most any surface.

Hall", "ReviewID": "R2LL745WBCFFB1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this television set as a Christmas gift. It was an upgrade for our family and it replaced an old, clunky tube television that we had prior to this one. This is a budget television and that is reflected in the average picture quality. That being said, for the price of this television this is a great deal. This television would be great for a spare bedroom, but depending on how often you plan on using the television, you may want to consider investing in a higher quality television.The physical installation of the TV was quick and painless. It can easily be assembled with only one person. The installation requires two screws and I was impressed at how safe and sturdy the television felt after being installed on to the included television stand. The television takes about four seconds to power on (which was concerning at first). I subtracted one star for the initial programming and set-up of the television. In order to scan channels it requires you to provide an activation code that must be collected from the manufacturer. There are several options given for obtaining this code (phone, web, or text). The text option did not work and I would expect that a brand-name television would have simple affairs like this in order. Additionally, if you plan to activate over the phone, you must call during business hours. After the inconvenience of going two routes unsuccessfully, I was able to find the activation code by going to the website. A word of wisdom for owners of this television, don't bother calling or trying to get the activation code by text. Go straight to the Westinghouse website and follow the instructions included with the television.After inputting the activation code, the television took 10 minutes to scan and auto-program our channels. Picture quality was average, but most buyers should know this going in. It is a huge step up if you are coming from an old tube-television, but those who really notice small details in television picture quality may be disappointed. There is a large amount of light bleed at the bottom and top of the picture that is noticeable when there are dark colors on the screen. While it isn't distracting for our family, I can understand how it may be distracting for others. The overall quality of the picture is good and we have been able to enjoy Blu-Ray quality movies and High Definition television.The four-star rating of this television is because of the value factor. For the price being paid, you are getting a good and working product that will be suitable for many individuals and families. If you are really into television quality, plan on hosting Super-Bowl parties, or are really particular about television quality, I would recommend exploring other television options. For every-day use, this does a good job and we are happy with the product.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Deal at Menards", "Author": "ssmith", "ReviewID": "RYPCM4FSR7HG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got one of these at Menards for 127 bucks!
