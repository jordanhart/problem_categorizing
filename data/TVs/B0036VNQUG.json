I should also be able to bring it to college with me. I didn't want it for watching tv, which I also haven't tested, but for games (xbox 360) and dvds. With these criteria i started my search. After looking at a few hdtv models I came upon this one which was $30+ lower than any other brand of this size. 19\" was perfect so I bought it. The estimated delivery time was 2-3 weeks. I got this item 2 days after I ordered it. That kind of blew my mindSo after getting the package and opening it, setting it up was very easy. Just attach the HDTV to the included stand and there you go. Everything came as advertised. After turning on the tv you go through a few menus and set up options. At first the format is standard (4:3) so after changing it to wide on the remote I started trying it out.The first thing I did was try my xbox 360 on it. Changed hd setting to 1080i (which it supports. The box says 720p/1080i)and tried out some games. The quality is very good but the presets for the tv (brightness, color) aren't very good. After custom changing it I was stunned by how good the quality was for the price. The quality matched my friends 42\" $1000+ sony hdtv (this may be because of the smaller size). After trying out multiple games I went on netflix instant watch. I tried out a video that came in hd format. I thought I was watching a hd dvd (possibly blue-ray) when I saw it. Very clear without any pixel changes on the screen. Very nice.Next I tried out some dvds with the same results. Again, switching the brightness, color, and contrast should be done whenever watching or switching games or movies, this makes the screen that much better.For the price its one of the best deals that there is. It comes with a 1-year parts and 90 days labor warranty from the manufacturer. I am very happy I chose this product. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Haier HL19D2 19`` LCD TV D Series", "Author": "Tropical Phil", "ReviewID": "R1RFNH48HRZ09Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After owning this television for over a month I am very happy with product.  This is the second Haier television I have purchased in the past 2 years and both have performed well.  This unit gives excellent picture and color clarity and for a small TV, with its front fired speakers, even the audio is acceptable.  I might have upgraded to the next size 22`` or 23`` model but for the small Den/Computer room it was purchased for, it is adequate.  The other Haier model considered had some complaints of sound quality perhaps due to the speaker location facing the lower bottom of unit compared to this unit where they are located at the lower front.  Set up was very easy too.  Odd that every time TV is turned on, Haier appears for a few seconds on the screen to remind you of what brand you purchased.  For its price and performance, I recommend.  Also suggest adding the extra 3 year Warranty for a few extra dollars with SquareTrade, which covers all parts and Labor if needed.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best HD TV Buy for My Chidren", "Author": "Sean A.M.", "ReviewID": "RDC9EZZDZ1L1U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV at a Holiday sale last year; it was $100. I had been wanting a wall-mount TV for my children's play-room to replace the little (but heavy) CRT we had been using, and it was pretty hard to overlook this kind of pricing for an HDTV. I was a little wary about the quality because I had not heard of Haier, and thought that an HDTV for such a low price had to be of poor quality, but I was definitely wrong.Not only is it great to have something inexpensive for the kids' room (if they rip it off the wall and break it: it's not a huge loss, and it's not heavy enough to injure anyone), but the quality is solid. There are also more picture-adjustment options on this TV than there are on my 42\" Panasonic Plasma ($1,100) which I bought for the main room about 3 years ago, but I haven't bothered to calibrate the Haier because the picture looked pretty good out of the box.Some people complain about the sound output & quality of budget HDTVs of this size, but I honestly have no complaints about the sound from the HL19D2. In fact, sometimes it's too loud, and I have to go into their room to turn in down. I think part of the reason we don't have any problems with the sound is that my kids have a small play space (around 200 square-feet), and as such the sound is perfectly audible in their room.My only complaint is that the viewing angle isn't great. I mounted the TV a little high on the wall so that it would be slightly out-of-reach for the children, and I was disappointed in how much the picture degrades if you're just a few degrees below the center-point; sitting on their floor (more than 15 degrees viewing-angle) makes for almost no picture. I remedied this by putting some shims behind the (non-adjustable, flat) mount to tilt it downwards, and haven't had any problems since. I chose a basic, non-articulating wall mount (sold separately; the H19D2 comes with a stand) so that the kids couldn't play with it, but I would recommend anyone else looking to buy this TV to at least purchase a tilting wall-mount, if not something with more options for articulation to compensate for the viewing-angle deficit.(Then again: the viewing angle on many LCDs isn't great, even higher-end models.)Also know that in a way you get what you pay for: there is no picture-in-picture option, and the picture controls -- while more robust than some high-end HDTVs -- are minimal. There is also no built-in WiFi, but this is not a problem for me because we don't have a need for it in our house. I have largely left-out things like menu options and robustness of function, because for us the most important thing is that it plays HD-content which looks good, and that we can hear the sound; everything else is secondary. There are some functions I have used and like, for example: the opacity of the menu is adjustable, and there is a database of \"favorite\" channels which are accessible via the \"favorites\" button on the remote.Part of the reason I like this TV so much is because I wasn't expecting a lot before I bought it, and it does the things which I expected it to do (display a high-definition picture with audio) quite well.On a side note: there was a short period of time when I used this TV for my PlayStation 3, and I was certainly pleased with the results. This would make a great HDTV for gaming in a small room, dormitory, or even for a portable gaming rig, and after trying it out I considered buying another one just for myself. After all, high-definition video does look better on smaller screens, and basically every game company ever has said to play their games on the smallest screen available. Aside from that: it would use a lot less energy than my plasma TV.For under $250 (including a wall-mount, blu-ray player, and digital antenna) my kids have HDTV in their room and can watch our ever-expanding DVD & Blu-Ray library. Also, like I said before, if something happens to it then it's not a huge loss. In fact, if something happened to this TV I would just buy another Haier to replace it.Pros:-Inexpensive-Good picture quality-Good sound quality for a small room-Durable (has withstood a year of poking, prodding, shaking, fingerprints, and toy-tossing)-Energy efficientCons:-Not the best viewing angle-Takes several seconds to turn-on after the power button is pressed-Slight remote latency", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "19 inch TV", "Author": "Phizz", "ReviewID": "R2BHKEQN0P7SOB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the Haier HL19D2.
