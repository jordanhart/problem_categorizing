{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One month Now and Better Than Great", "Author": "B Shafer \"Retiredtelecom\"", "ReviewID": "RE4W3R4QEFLLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 6 1/2-year old Toshiba 63\" HD DLP which had been sick on and off for the better part of a year and finally \"gave up the ghost\" this past Tuesday evening so Wednesday morning I began searching for the best value for a new TV.Since I knew the Toshiba, which was a great TV for the better part of 5 \u00bd years, was going South, I had been looking for the best value in a new TV for the better part of 7 or 8 months.  I was willing to scale down the size of the new TV to as small as a 46\" if the price was right and finally make a decision to buy an LCD TV no smaller than 50\" and at least 46\" LED if the price was right.About 2 months ago I found the TCL LE46FHDE5300 listed at Best Buy for $549.00 which I thought was a great buy for a 46\" LED TV however, there were no customer reviews and, at the time, they showed a six week delivery time.  I had never heard of TCL so, after a quick search, I found that Amazon also carried the brand with the same price as Best Buy but Amazon showed that they would ship it in 1 business day.  I then did a search on the company and learned TCL was a muli-billion dollar firm that had a large presence in Europe and Asia and made private label TVs for several brand names in the U.S. so I felt comfortable with the company and the product.I kept track on the 46\" TCL product on both Amazon and Best Buy for the last two months as well as several other 50\" and 55\" LCD TVs on several other sites hoping that my old TV would hold out crashing until Black Friday.  About a month ago I noticed that both Best Buy and Amazon had reduced the price of the 46\" TCL LED to $499...an even better buy than earlier.  Additionally, while the Best Buy site still had no customer reviews for the product, customer reviews on the Amazon website had increased from 4 or 5 to over 20 with an average rating of over 4 out of 5, including 14 five star ratings.Well my Black Wednesday came 4 days ago so I was forced to make an immediate decision.  Best Buy showed a delivery window of 2 to 7 days while Amazon showed same day shipping and 2-day delivery at no charge.  The cost for the TV was exactly the same at both locations but I would not have to pay the $35 sales tax if I bought it from Amazon and I would receive it quicker...it did not take a rocket scientist to make the decision to buy it from Amazon.I ordered the TV at 3:30 on Thursday afternoon and Amazon stated that I would receive it on Saturday however, I was more than surprised and pleased when it showed up Friday afternoon at 1:30pm...fantastic 23hr service for no additional charge!I did not set the TCL unit up until Saturday morning since I needed a friend to help me move the old 63\" (heavy) TV out of the living room.  The only problem I encountered during the setup process was a little different cabling between the new TCL TV and my AV receiver but after 45 minutes we were able to figure it out.  Lastly, the setup for my Harmony 650 universal remote which I thought may end up being a problem took less than 5 minutes.When we finally got everything set up correctly I was more than pleased with the picture and must say it is as good a picture as I have seen on other LED TVs at twice the price.  The TV is very light and extremely thin and, being an LED TV, it will use at least 75% less power over the annual cost of my old DLP TV.  So, so far so good, and, if all goes well the next couple of months, I may even buy another 46\" TCL TV to replace my 1-year old 42\" Sharp LCD I bought on Black Friday last year.Update 10/11/12I have now had this TV for just over a month and now can say it's the best TV I have ever purchased which have been more than just a few including 6 HD TVs.  I have now decided to go ahead and buy another TCL within the next couple of months but this time I will spring for the 55\" model.  The only complaint I have is I wish it had more than 2 HDMI inputs.  I needed a 3rd HDMI for my Roku device for streaming Netflix but I just switched the DVD player over to the composite video input and then plugged the Roku device into the 2nd HDMI.  The TV's sound is a little weak but I use an AV receiver so that does not affect the my audio quality.  Any person looking to purchase or upgrade to a LED TV would be nuts not to seriously consider buying this TV!In closing I would like to relate another story related to my 46\" TCL HD LED TV.  As I stated previously, I have decided to buy another 55\" TCL TV in the next couple of months and replace a year old 42\" Sharp LCD TV in the bedroom with this TV and put the planned 55\" TCL in the living room.  That will leave me with a spare 42\" Sharp LCD TV which I plan to sell at the local flea market.  At the time I bought the 42\" Sharp I did purchase a 4-year warranty from Best Buy and called their customer service department to see if I could transfer the warranty to the new owner (fyi, the answer was yes).  During the conversation she asked me why I was planning to sell the Sharp and if anything was wrong.  I told her no and then told her about the 46\" TCL TV I had purchased and how happy I was with it.  The bottom line is she needed a new TV and actually ended up buying a 46\" TCL for herself and called me back yesterday to thank me and let me know how much she is enjoying her new TV.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful design, great picture, great price", "Author": "D.

The glass base is a nice modern touch, the TV actually improved the design of my bedroom. Picture quality is fantastic even from close distances - got it just in time to watch the NHL Playoffs in 720p and was beyond satisfied (hockey pucks often disappear on lesser TVs). I was hesitant to buy from an unfamiliar brand but this was a great decision, probably one of the best deals out there. This is definitely a 5 star HDTV for a crazy price. Classic hidden gem on Amazon! I'd definitely buy from TCL again, especially at a price like this.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "When a budget TV doesn't LOOK like a budget TV", "Author": "ScOObydoo", "ReviewID": "R3SETLVKHTDF70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most of the time, a low budget TV looks just like that - cheap and ugly. This TCL is a very rare exception. It starts with the bezel around the screen - if you have ever invested in a really cheap TV (think RCA, Westinghouse, Coby), you'll know that an inch or two around the panel is normal. Not so in the TCL 32\". The bezel is about as slim as the one on my $1000 Samsung.The panel used in this TV is also top notch, I'm guessing Samsung or LG. Nice and crisp, no defective dots or other nastiness. Plenty of inputs on the back too, but the \"smart\" features are a bit disappointing. It'll do MP3 or photos, but no video. It wouldn't have cost a lot more to add something a little better.In fact, the only thing I don't like on this thing is the remote control. You really will want to spend a little more on a good Universal remove, as the included one is pretty lousy. Oh, and whoever comes up with the model names for these at TCL needs to go back to product naming school. TCL LE32HDE5300 is a stupid name :DPROS:Excellent panelAmazing designLow priceFree 2 year warrantyWell designed standCONS:RemoteNo \"smart TV\" features\"Audio is a little weakBottom line - if your budget is in the $250 - $350 range, this TCL won't disappoint. Don't let the lack of a brand name fool you either, TCL is the fifth largest TV maker in the world. Remember when nobody had ever heard of Vizio?", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broken During Manufacturing / Replacement also bad", "Author": "m m smits", "ReviewID": "R3TEDZGIHN060J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very excited to get this TV.  I did my research on the TV itself as well as the brand, and felt comfortable with both.  UPS showed up today with a clean, unopened, undamaged box.  I took down my old (Olevia 32\") TV, routed the cables, put on the plate for the wall mount, and connected the power.  It's a beautiful TV.  Very thin bezel, small logo, simple red LED around the on switch indicating power is connected.Until I turned it on.  There is a crack on the -inside- of the LCD screen, from top right to bottom left.  Since the packaging was intact and there was no visible damage to the -exterior- of the TV, I can only assume the damage occurred during manufacturing.  Obviously, TCL does not check their products for quality or this would have stood out like Red Riding Hood at a Metallica concert.  I'll upload a picture to show you.Like a fool I just ordered a replacement, so now I have to wait yet another two days for my TV to get here (even though this one just left the warehouse late yesterday).  I'll post an update when I get it and hook it up, and if that one is okay, I'll update my rating.  But until then, I'm afraid I can't rate it higher than 1 star.So, this TV might be great, but I won't know until Amazon gets its butt in gear and gets me my replacement.  However, it is obvious TCL's quality control leaves a lot to be desired.  As always: buyer beware!UPDATE (8/3/12)Received the replacement today.  Lesson learned, I plugged it in before mounting it on the wall.  Seemed okay.  Again, there was no damage to the packaging and no damage visible on the TV (make sure you understand this before you post a comment to my review).  I proceeded to take down my existing TV, place the wall bracket on the TCL, and finished the installation (takes about 30 minutes).I turned it on, and as tested, it worked fine.  Resolution of the menu was very poor, but I can understand that.  The menu background was faded from blue to almost black, but that might just be how they do it.  Once the channel scan was completed and I turned to the first HD channel that came up, I immediately noticed the right side of the screen was bad.  Not sure how to describe it, so I uploaded a picture as well.  There is barely any backlight in the center, and on the right the display can't keep up with the input signal, with bright green pixels streaking with the action on the screen.  I went through the menu to see if there was a reset.  I tried a BD via HDMI.  I even unplugged and plugged back in.  Same issue every time.If this had happened once, I can understand.  Even at .01% failure there's a chance there's a bad product when you build thousands every month.  But now I got a second one that was also bad.  I'm not going to try \"third time's the charm\".  Unfortunately, I'll have to spend a lot more, but I'm going with a different brand (of course that TV is not in stock - sigh).BOTTOM LINEYou may have better luck with your TV.  The price is good enough to try it twice if need be, and who knows, you might get a good one the first time.  But I will not buy another product from the company.  I really wanted to like this TV because the price was right and it's actually a very nice looking TV with the thin bezel.NOTE: This was not Amazon's failure, nor UPS.  Amazon shipped me a replacement the very next day (KUDOS!) and UPS hand delivered the clean, undamaged box to my front door.  THIS IS A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM!", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "All for Less, I'm Impressed !!", "Author": "Humshark", "ReviewID": "R2R095GEMYITD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was an exchange purchase ( returned a LG 27\" that broke ) and in the end, to pay less for this set after shipping amazes me.First off - this is a larger picture over the set we previously had.  Since we are limited in the available mounting space I was concerned - but unnecessarily.  THE EXTREMELY THIN BORDERS AND EXTREMELY THIN PROFILE HELPS THIS SET FIT INTO AREAS THAT ARE TIGHT.Second - I was concerned about the brand - but impressed with the wty.  No one likes to deal with service and returns, including a manufacturer, so based on reviews and a leap of faith - I purchased this and so far, I'm impressed!PICTURE:  WOW!  For a set that costs $100 bucks less than a comparable Panasonic this surpasses my expectation.  The ANGLE of view, or your ability to cross from left to right, or up and down in comparison to the screen without DRASTIC color shifts is VERY GOOD.  Our viewing area is shallow but wider.  This set manages the task of looking good from nearly every sitting space available.  The set has easy preset picture modes to select that are easy and good on the eyes.  The econo mode leaves the picture a little pasty to me, so I have found that we like the \"natural\" setting better.  What's even better, is that the TV remembers the setting for each channel from what I can tell.  Very nice feature.CHANNELS:  We use this mostly for OTA ( Over the Air ) and BD ( BlueRay Disk ) viewing.  The scan function was very fast compared to other models I have set up.  You can easily page through the found channels and select or deselect them from your channel up/down list.  VERY EASY.SOUND:  Like most small sets, or sets that leverage space for picture, the sound is adequate.  There are nice adjustments you can set, including preset audio modes that make getting decent sound an easy feat.  If you want good to great sound you'll have to add an external system.  This set HAS a Digital Audio Component output much like what has become standard on the back of cable boxes.  It also has a HEADPHONE jack helping you to successfully hook up to whatever external audio device you'd like.  I am extremely satisfied considering the last set from another manufacturer had zero audio outputs.REMOTE:  Sits flat on a table which is nice.  Powerful enough that you don't have to aim directly at the set.  The only complaint I have is that the remote appears to send \"double\" actuation easily.  Hit the channel up button once and you skip two channels.  It appears to happen on each button you may press on the remote.  This usually means that there is an over-sensitive electronic input section within the remote.  Again not a deal breaker for me.  It works, and for the price, I'm NOT complaining.Overall this would earn a 4.5 but since we can't do 1/2 stars I'll give it the coveted full 5 star rating because of it's value for the price!", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Bargain, Great TV", "Author": "Paul The Nice Guy", "ReviewID": "R2UHH7Y7ZEEYGE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Buy, Great TV - My old 32\" CRT was going belly-up on me so I started shopping for a replacement. When I saw the TCL HDTVs I got interested. From a price standpoint they were great. But my concern was that they might be cheap, compared to the high end units, but that they might also be cheaply made. Finally, after much deliberation, I placed my order with Amazon for the TCL LE46FHDE5300 46-Inch 1080p Slim LED HDTV.It Arrived today and I couldn't wait to get the box open. After getting everything out of the box and checking it out I was delighted to see that it wasn't cheaply made. It looks really good.Then I started setting it up. I installed the stand and stood it up. The glass stand looks good and seems to be very stable. Then I plugged in the power cord, put batteries in the remote and fired it up.The setup menu was easy to follow except that the remote is really sensitive and pressing the up or down arrow sometimes jumped two or three steps. Other than that it went well. The channel scan took a long time but it found a bunch of digital channels I didn't know I had access to. That was a bonus.The rest of the setup went smoothly and I was soon enjoying a perfect picture and descent sound. I like the ability to switch picture modes and zoom without going through the menus. I got the sound setup the way I like it, got the equalizer adjusted to suit my ears and sat back to enjoy my first ever flat screen TV.I think that the picture quality is great. If I'm not mistaken I believe the panel is actually made by Samsung. But whoever makes it, it's great. Sharp and clear and no lag in fast action shots.The sound is fine, for me. But I'm hearing impaired and a true audiophile might want to add a sound bar. It's good for me, though. And I like the Stable Sound feature.Compared to other 46\" TVs I think the TCL is a great bargain and wouldn't hesitate to order another when the time comes.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I cannot find fault with this TV; its one shortcoming was anticipated...", "Author": "Creedeco \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R1U9V0ZACG4M19", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This set was an upgrade for a smaller flatscreen TV in our vacation cabin's bedroom, and paramount in its selection was its ability to use the same 100mm x 100mm VESA mounting bracket we employed with the older set.  We had it mounted to the wall ten minutes after its arrival - and we've been thrilled ever since!  Although I guess I'm no videophile, I think the picture is perfect: colors are rendered accurately, and the picture is sharp.  The TV's speakers are a bit weak, but that's to be expected... we have it connected via the provided headphone jack to a set of amplified PC speakers (with a subwoofer), and consider that shortcoming resolved.The set is connected to a netbook-style PC via a typical D-Sub video cable (with an accompanying audio cable), through which we channel Amazon Prime video, Netflix, and televison from home via a Slingbox, and I was surprised, a little, to find the TV accepting of the netbook's available 1360x768 video output.  This resoltion fills the screen top to bottom and side-to-side with a clear picture.  The TV's manual suggests only its willingness to accept a maximum of 1024x768 - but it can do better!  We also have the set connected to an upconverting-style DVD player via an HDMI cable, and the set advertises its resolution through this connection as 1080P.  From the set's specs, I didn't expect to find this.  We do not have the set connected to an antenna, nor to our satellite box.Given the set's excellent picture, price, specifications, two-year warranty, and Amazon's top-notch service - I see no reason to look any further!", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV At A Great Price", "Author": "T. Ganz", "ReviewID": "R2EPAX6XP3LVG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV for approximately 3 days, and I am nothing but thoroughly impressed with it.  This is the first flat panel TV that we have owned, and so I did some extensive research.  Three things stuck out to me that makes this TV an excellent deal, and frankly would be a purchase I would make again even if I had unlimited funds to purchase a more expensive brand.First, the visual quality of the screen is superb, with very even crisp lighting, deep blacks, and very rich colors.  Some may scoff at the 60 Hz refresh rate vs 120 or even 240, but I have not noticed any significant drawback to this, and have enjoyed sports and action movies with quick movement without any significant deterioration in picture quality.  Unlike some other reviewers, I noticed absolutely no defect in the screen, and have tested it on solid color screen images (black, white, and blue) and have found no defects.Second, the TV is very, very aesthetically pleasing, and is very thin, with a very thin bezel.  I think that this is one of the major selling points for this TV at this price point.  Certainly, one can find TVs from other, more \"reputable\" manufacturers, but you'll simply be purchasing older, clunkier technology with thicker panels, thicker bezels, and lighting that is not as crisp as LEDs.  When I was shopping for TVs, I was actively comparing this TV to an LG plasma and Vizio LCD, both at a similar price point, but both had poorer aesthetics.Third, the user interface is simple and very intuitive without additional, redundant features.  I appreciate the fact that I don't have to deal with/pay for features that are replicated in other devices that I own, unlike other TV manufacturers.  TCL provides a product that does an excellent job of displaying images and doesn't attempt to include an email feature, a facebook feature, a link to my twitter account, or access to online video resources, because frankly, they would probably do a pretty poor job at that.  If you want access to online content, get a Roku or a Blu-ray player with integrated WiFi.Lastly, the only cons that I can see so far is the small number/lack of some ports.  This TV only has 2 HDMI ports, one RCA, one coax, one component, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and an audio coax port.  These are more than enough for my needs, but some other manufacturers provide 3 HDMI ports, and many a digital audio TOSLINK port.  2 HDMI should be enough and most audio systems support digital coax.  As for which TCL to choose, I was comparing this model to the TCL LE43FHDF3300TA, and the only difference I could see was that this model clearly shows mounting holes on the back of the TV, whereas the TCL LE43FHDF3300TA did not.  I am basing this only from the pictures provided by Amazon, so I could be wrong.In summary, this is a great TV at a great price that has excellent screen quality, great aesthetics, and a simple, intuitive user interface without unnecessary bells and whistles.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad at all!", "Author": "Quaz", "ReviewID": "R2ZMJ1O8WJ84MA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this 42\" TV last week and am VERY pleased with it.Set-up:I wall-mounted it, so I didn't run into any of the stand screw issues, and the universal mount fit without any problems.  The power cord is a bit short, but since its plug doesn't have a third prong, any extension cord will do.Connections:Yeah it would be nice to have more HDMI ports, but two should be fine, especially since this TV should really be used with a surround sound amplifier for the best experience anyway.  This being my first time wall-mounting a TV, I waited to plug in the cords until after I had put it on the wall, which is a bit silly, but I didn't have any problems getting the cords plugged in.  One thing I really liked about the HDMI ports is that they are aligned vertically instead of horizontally.  I have recently had the HDMI ports on two televisions develop loose connections from normal use, and this setup seems likely to be more resilient by design.  Time will tell, I suppose.Sound:I can't say too much about the sound since I've got the TV plugged into an amplifier and haven't really tested it, but I can say that I am VERY happy that the TV supports a digital connection using the old Philips/RCA jack and Dolby Surround sound, which I have plugged into my OLD Cambridge Soundworks DTT2500; not even my fancy Samsung model TV from two years ago has one of those.  Also, for the hearing impaired, it has a standard headphone out jack that can be used with any number of wireless headphones.Image:When the TV has an image that fills the whole screen it looks quite nice.  But I do notice the uneven back-light some others have posted about, when the screen is completely black.  At first I was upset (not enough to return the TV by far) but I have gotten used to it.  Something else is that when I have played old, standard aspect ratio Playstation One games, the black borders don't seem to have that effect, or at least it is not very noticeable.Menus:The menus are very simple, but are also very responsive, unlike my Samsung TV, which are complex and SLOW to navigate.Tuner:I was able to pick up several stations over the air using just some rabbit ears.  A real antenna would probably do much better.The Remote:I don't hate it at all.  It's bare-bones and functional for controlling the TV.  If you try to use a universal remote control and can't get the codes to work right, try a Logitech Harmony remote.  I own two and they are very nice, especially when you have many components that you need to turn on.Misc:This is also the thinnest TV I have owned.  When I was mounting it, I got the feeling like I had to be especially careful with it; my other TV is flat-screen but several inches thick, so I don't get the same sense.I noticed today that after being away from the TV for a while, I came back to find it had turned itself off.  I have my computer hooked up to it and the computer goes into power-save mode after so long.  I can only guess that the TV won't stay on if it isn't receiving a signal for any length of time.  Pretty cool feature, especially since I tend to get called out of the room pretty frequently.  I haven't hooked the TV up to my Kill-a-watt yet, but this feature, together with the non-existent heat output (I have the TV really tucked into a small space) bode well for my utility bill.I also noticed that my computer's graphics card (Nvidia Geforce 9800gt) seems to think the \"native resolution\" for this TV is 1280x720.  It does support resolutions up to 1080p and after resizing the desktop to eliminate over-scan, it looks great, but I thought that worth mentioning.With regard to the turn-on time, yes it takes a few seconds, but no more than my amplifier takes to turn on with my other TV.

My TV arrived without mounting screws for the base of the TV.  I think the TV is new and not previously used, but the packaging had definitely been opened and taped up again.  Amazon support was great and they would have taken the TV back, but was it worth the hassle of repackaging the set and scheduling a pickup?  Besides, I wanted to see the All Star game on my new big screen!  So, as Amazon advised, I called TCL support.  This was a journey into 3rd-world call center culture - POOR QUALITY.  I had to bear with hold time,first level support scripts, and then second level support.  The most important issue to technical support was that I provide proof of purchase.  They will get back to me in 3-4 days on their decision and, if approved, the screws will take another 2 weeks - I can't make this stuff up.  Is this company that paranoid to suspect someone scamming them for 8 lousy screws? And where do the screws come from and what slow boat are they shipped on?  So I went to the hardware store and fixed the thing myself.  I am sure I voided the warranty by using non-TCL approved screws.UPDATE - TCL did get back to me and said that they don't stock the screws (go figure).My advice is to buy this TV with your eyes wide open.  It has a great picture, has good features, and seems to work fine - plus it uses hardly any power.  Where can you score a 46 inch LED TV for this price?

Garbage dump?) now since the first of August 6, 2012.  That makes it 3 months.In talking to my husband last night he said \"I bet the reason these TV's are so inexpensive is they bought up all the discontinued parts sitting around in China, assembled the TV's and sold them dirt cheap.\"  So what if they break?  They are disposable!  Trouble is they don't inform the customers that they are throw-aways.  Instead they talk about their warranty!  And their Customer Service!!!.  The disposable TV theory makes sense to me particularly given the treatment we have gotten.  I am putting this review on EVERY TCL TV even though we only bought the 42 inch version.In looking at other reviews (and not just on Amazon) TCL has this same ho-hum attitude about customer service for ALL of their TV's.  I promise to eat crow if we ever see that TV again, but I don't think I'll be burping feathers any time soon.  I would bet money we will never see that TV again.  I'd appreciate any comments where people have had satisfactory customer service - it might restore my faith that I will see that TV on the front porch in the next couple of years.----------------------------------My original review written in October still stands:When we set it up, we were very happy with the picture quality, there were a few dead pixels, but that doesn't show up much and we weren't concerned. But the whole panel died after only 6 months. We aren't big TV watchers either. The thing was on less than 5 hours a week.So we contacted TCL (after several tries to get them on the phone), they gave us the number of the repair shop we were to send this TV to. After several tries, I got them on the phone. They agreed to send us a box to ship it in (a whole other fiasco, but that's not to do with the TV).We received the packing box (after a couple of weeks). We packed it and sent it to them Fed-Ex the same day.Now the Big Wait begins. After 3 weeks I called (again, several times, for several days before an answer). Oh, its here, it is in our shop and they are working on it. Sometimes it takes a couple of weeks because we are So Busy!!OK. Fine. We wait some more. Three more weeks. I call (yes, again, several times over a period of days before I get an answer). NOW there is a problem getting the part. But it should be in 'any time now'.Hmmm. So I wait some more. Another 3 weeks. I call (here we go again! several times a day, for several days -FINALLY an answer). This time someone let the cat out of the bag and told me that the 'panel' that my TV needs is on 'back order'. They have a warehouse full of TCL TV's waiting for this part. She was honest enough to say that it could be 3 months or 3 years before it is received. They simply do not know.Of course it is not the repair shop's fault. I am mad at them for not being more forthcoming, but it is TCL's fault for not providing proper warranty service - TCL simply does not care about customer service.I will update this review as things change, but things probably won't change. This week I am due to call again. I am nothing if not persistent.So, you can go ahead and buy a TCL TV, and you might get lucky and get one that works for a while. But then you can send it to the repair shop so it can keep mine company - in the 'warehouse full of TCL TV's needing repair'.Fair Winds,Cap'n Jan", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible - DO NOT BUY THIS OR FROM THIS COMPANY", "Author": "Joe Kupiszewski", "ReviewID": "RPSOMCHS0PH4K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I understand there is \"fine print\" and all.  I got this television for my 74 year old mother and 80 year old father.  At first, great, than within about 2 months it just quit.  So, no my 74 year old mom has had to spend endless hours with what they call tech support.  After waiting about a week or two some parts arrived.  Then they had to schedule a technician, which took more frustrating phone calls and while the technician was professional and nice, he could not fix the problem.  So, at this point we are under the impression we will get a new TV.  Not so fast my friend.  They will now (insert two more weeks) send us a box so we can send the television to them so they can try to repair it.ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  NEVER had this bad of customer service and unfortunately for me I did not buy the add'l warranty and I did not listen to others complaints about the customer service.I know many of you will say you pay for what you get, but it was still nearly $400 and that does NOT equal a broken TV and practically zero customer service.Hopefully this review will convince others to buy a different brand.

This is our first flat screen.  It is in a kitchen.The colors on this set are amazing.  The black looks great.  I've seen the best skin tones on this set than I have ever seen anywhere.  The resolution is amazing.  All of this just with the settings out of the box.  We haven't tweaked to other reviewers suggested settings.  We got the 32\" for a 10'x12' room.  More than satisfied.  According to some professional viewing guidelines, the optimal viewing distance for 32\" 720p resolution is 6'.  And it is great.  Even closer it is great.  So, some small writing you can see the pixals step if you look at the curves.  No big deal.  Can actually read all of the tiny writing that occurs at the bottom of car advertisements and such.  That's a first for us.  Yea!As with anything it's beauty is dependent on the signal it receives.  We're doing an antenna on this set.  So, the national shows like CSI look better than say the local news which are obviously recorded in a lower resolution.  The tv will not allow a screen resizing to small to make up for this from what I can tell so far from usage.  It will stretch, be normal, and zoom though.It isn't perfect.  So, from reading all of the reviews I did examine the screen carefully.  Actually much to my regret, but more on that later.  So, I didn't pop in a suggested DVD for this purpose or hook it up to my laptop.  It isn't hooked up currently to anything but the antenna.  But, when watching a football game a week ago I looked for defects.  I did notice that there are a couple of small dime-size areas on the lower corners of the set that show slightly lighter when the scene is bright.  So, one can't see it when the scene is dark, but when the scene is really light one can notice it.  (Actually I noticed the second spot when I went looking for it after I reasoned that maybe it was some interal screws pressing slightly on the screen causing the lightening?)  Also, I noticed that the image of the crowd (lots of small lights and darks close together)seems to move.  Sort of the effect when you look at a bunch of zebra stripes. (?) I don't know if there is a lack in the processing of the tv set.  But it is not much.  And frankly, I've seen this same effect on crt tvs.  Now, to the regret.  I don't think I would ever have noticed EITHER of these faults until I stupidly looked for them as suggested by other reviewers.  The night after I found the defect, I kept looking for them.  Like a sore tooth.  But, I just stopped doing it and now I don't see them.  I can't speak to how it would function as a pc monitor, nor how well it would display video games.  But, we just wanted a source of info and entertainment when cooking, and we are more than happy.  The sound is ok, lacking if you've a noisy environ, but we just hooked it up to a small speaker system.It is far more than we expected.  Thin frame.  Beautiful colors.  Sooo light! 16#!  $8 estimated yearly running cost!  We are very happy.We paired this unit with a VideoSecu LCD LED TV Wall Mount Full Motion with Swivel Articulating Arm for 23-37 inches, up to 42 inches in TV Flat Panel Screen With VESA 200 100.  It works beautifully and makes it easy for when we do want to hook up a dvd player.I'll write more if something changes.  But, this set was so worth the $249.  A samsung was $100 more and I don't think it looks better than this.The box was not crushed, punctured, or marked.  Yea! UPS and AMAZON.  And the tv was packed with a styrofoam frame that seemed to keep the set inside happily suspended.  Very pleased.

I've heard rumors that these use Samsung panels, and I wouldn't doubt it. Out-of-the-box settings aren't bad, and it's very easy to calibrate. I believe my settings are as follows (calibrated with AVS HD calibration disk and blue-tinted filter):Brightness 50Contrast 100Sharpness 0Color 35Tint -1Color temperature 2Backlight 60All other settings (dynamic backlight, noise reduction, etc) set to off or lowest settingAs mentioned, the overall picture quality is great. The black levels are good, but there is a bit of backlight bleed around the bottom and edges. It's quite minor, though, and definitely better than any other budget TV I've seen. Close enough to higher-end TVs. I really want to stress that it is a very, very minor issue that most won't notice. There is also some ghosting present in the image, but I'm also sensitive to this. I'm also used to my 120Hz gaming monitor, so it stands out more to me. For most others, again, it will likely go completely unnoticed and is still acceptable for a nice TV. Long story short, this TV does not LOOK like a budget TV by any means.Build quality is solid, and the design is very sleek. I like the metallic, thin bezel and the glass bass. And, being LED backlit, the TV is thin. Very impressed. It does not FEEL like a budget TV.CONS:Sound quality is quite poor. It's up there with some pretty bad TVs. Definitely SOUNDS like a budget TV. It's certainly usable, but I can't recommend using this enough with a better sound system.Input ports are lacking in quantity, like many smaller or budget TVs.The remote is very basic. Do I care? No. Will some? Yes.The TV stand was fairly difficult to get on. It was very difficult getting the screws all the way in. It takes time, patience, and a bit of muscle. Make sure you're using the correct screwdriver head! That makes it much easier (obvious, I know, but it makes a larger difference than expected).Overall, I was floored by how good the TV looked for the price I payed. I am surprised these TVs are not more popular! Sure, it certainly shows many budget characteristics, but it excels where it counts!Update (7-24-2013): I still stand by everything I said, but I did end up swapping this out for a plasma TV due to the motion blur and ghosting. It became more prevalent with use. Again, I'm sensitive to this, and even then it's only really and issue for video games.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a great TV!!", "Author": "First-timer", "ReviewID": "R3VPMZJBTLRV0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first flat panel TV and I love it!

The first was a technology review of TCL televisions:TCL is the 5th largest manufacturer of televisions in the world. Based out of China.In 2013 the company will be entering USA more, partnering with retail stores.They use Samsung screens and parts.It's indeed a SLIM TV.AND it comes with a TWO year Warranty!  The website lists warranty stores via your location.The TV comes packaged well.  Large pieces of foam keep it centered in the box so that nothing hits the TV itself and it stays secure.  The box must be broken open to damage the TV itself.  The remote, instructions and batteries are in a zip lock bag, taped inside the box.Keep in mind the reason this TV can be sold at this price is that there are no extras/frills with it.FedEx delivered it overnight.The remote is a basic remote.  It does not light up, nor does it have the extras as other remotes have.  BUT remember now a days many use the remote that comes through your cable box or many purchase a fancy remote.The TV itself does not have the extras big brand TV's have.The sound comes from two speakers on the bottom, about the size of a silver dollar.  For me they work fine.  Again it's not a fancy TV with big name speakers  It's in a larger size room, and there is no problem.  I'm debating on getting speakers as I'd like to hear the helicopter flying over my head while I'm watching it on a movie :-)WHAT It DOES have is a great screen!  Watching on regular is great!  Watching on a channel with HD is even greater!  For sports you can see the athletes sweating!It is a blue energy star television!  As you can see in the item description, watching it for 5 hours a day costs eleven dollars and ?? cents.  On the graph you will see it's one of if not thee best TV's for using the lowest amount of electricity in this size of screens.Before going further let me say that you need to set aside a good HOUR if not longer to set up everything.  If you keep looking at the clock, problems will happen.Also know this is a LED TV, Light Emitting Diode.  Not LCD...Liquid Crystals (use more energy).  Not Plasma.For those who have COMCAST Cable TV and want the remote to work the on/off and volume!!  If you have the SILVER REMOTE with the RED SELECT Button in the middle....this is code to have the volume and on/off of the TV sync with the Comcast Remote:  10047.  I'm unsure if it will work with other remotes.  But the Comcast book does not list any codes for TCL nor does customer service for Comcast or TCL give the proper code.Another Comcast remote we have from an older box (black remote with blue SEL button) we found by using the code SCAN feature.  It took a good twenty minutes, but it now works the volume and on/off.The back of the TV has the attachments.  2 HDMI, 1 USB, 1 AV, 1 CMPT, 1 PC and TV.One Warning is the base is a heavy glass.  It's packaged well in a foam slot.  But once you remote it, hold onto it as it may well crack if dropped.  And if you drop it on your foot, your foot may well break!A Phillips screwdriver attaches the 4 screws the base/TV.  Make sure the rubber \"grippers\" are facing towards you so to \"grip\" the stand when you turn the TV right-side-up.  If you put it on the wall, I'm no help with that.Setting up a XBox was easy and the screen looks awesome!Also there is a sleep timer.I'm unsure if this is universal, (and I called TCL customer service where I got an actual human on the phone), on the TV does not turn off completely unless you unplug it.  The red power on/off light stays on and according to the directions it's in \"stand-bye\" mode. Customer service confirmed this but stated it uses a \"fraction of power\" while in that mode.Also when turning the TV on it takes about ten seconds for the TV to do on (the red light goes off so you know the TV will be turning on....use this for setting the remote so you know you have the right code.....see above)  after you see the TCL logo on the screen.  I went to a national retail for that sells TV electronics and they confirmed that many TV's both stay in a stand-bye mode unless you unplug it and also take a 10-15 seconds to turn on.  The turning on has to do with the LED behind the screen.I have no problems with the screen and sunlight or in the dark.  There are adjustments for Picture preference (sports, cinema, personal, natural, ECO, vibrant).  However that's very minor to me.This TV provides me with everything I need.  I can watch TV, DVD, sound is good, it's a blue star energy saver, and there is a 2 year warranty.A great deal!", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bezel measurements misleading, but a great-looking TV!", "Author": "Tom D.", "ReviewID": "R2NWJXDTGREZOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is of the 32\" model.First off, this TV looks a LOT nicer than anything else in its price range when it's not in use. Good build quality, thin profile, tasteful 'TCL' logo, dim red lighted ring around power button, thin matte black bezel, and an understated smoked glass base for the stand. We were very pleased to be able to spend only $200 on a TV, and not have to have something junking up the living area. We had previously wandered around Best Buy for a while looking for a cheap, nice-looking TV, and had come away disappointed. We had never heard of TCL, but according to Wikipedia they are the 4th-largest TV producer in the world (after Samsung, LG, Sony).Picture quality is totally acceptable, especially when you dial down the brightness, contrast, and saturation from the garish default settings. Not the deepest of blacks, but no problems that actually jump out at you while watching a program.Sound quality is also totally acceptable for built-in speakers, with no distortion at normal listening levels. I haven't even bothered to run the audio out to my stereo system yet because the sound is fine for living room viewing.I appreciate that there is a decent selection of inputs and outputs, with 2 HDMI in, and analog audio out being particularly important to me. The built-in tuner works well (we paired this TV with a refurb'd Leaf Indoor HDTV Antenna for free over-the-air HDTV channels)BEZEL SIZE ISSUE:The TV picture doesn't go all the way up to the inside edge of the bezel. There's about a 1/8\" black gap (see customer photos, above). So while the raised plastic bezel may only 0.6\" wide, as advertised, the distance from the edge of the case to the beginning of the TV picture is more like 0.9\". Actually, I don't mind that they made this design decision (since it makes the TV look even sleeker while it's off), but it does make the specs a little misleading.This is not an overscan correction issue--the gap is apparent on the blue screen displayed by the TV when no input is present, and on the startup screen when you first turn on the TV. There are apparently no addressable pixels in that space. There's no there, there.If you are not a cinephile, but just want a nice looking, perfectly capable 32\" flat-screen, I recommend this TV very highly!", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "This TV is absolutely great for the price!", "Author": "J.

This television is beautiful!  It is well built, has a fantastic finish, and a great image!  I wanted something that had a thin outer frame, because the high gloss plastic in which  nearly all manufacturers wrap their televisions simply looks cheap. Besides, high-gloss finishes don't blend well into most decors.  In fact, our family lives in a hundred year old craftsman home, and although it is nicely updated, a huge piece of piano black plastic looks like just that.  Notice Pottery Barn and Restoration Hardware designers rarely to never use images of their products next to high-gloss, piano black TVs?  The frame on this TV is not only thin, but has a nice high-end, brushed finish.  Speaking of that cheap plastic, have you ever tried to dust it without leaving scratches in its luxurious finish?  This television sits on a glass base that reminds me of the nice glass on our local bank president's desk.  It is easy to clean without scratching, and seems quite sturdy.  The image quality of this TV is also incredible.

Denick", "ReviewID": "RJD8BW8S65T7W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a fan of TCL TVs. I purchased a 32\" TCL LED two years ago for my bedroom, and I love it. Based on that experience, I was happy to purchase this 46\" LED, but it has unfortunately failed my expectations in almost every possible way.First of all, this LED is resulting in motion blur, particularly when streaming Netflix and watching cable TV. It is blatant enough that it becomes extremely distracting, so much so that I cannot watch a program without it really bothering me. I am certain that it is not the source and/or connections, because I do not experience any type of blur with my other TVs, and they are all 60 Hz (just like this one). When watching Blu-ray, the picture quality is outstanding, with no blur. But the fact that I can't watch Netflix, or even cable, is a deal breaker for me.Second, this TV provides only two HDMI ports (disappointing, since my smaller, older TCL has FIVE). I could make do with only two, if not for the fact that they are FAULTY. They are placed unusually close to one another, and you have to really wrestle with the two HDMI cables to get them both connected. I struggled for fifteen minutes to get them both firmly in place, where they would both output signal to the TV. First, I could only get HDMI 1 to work, then only HDMI 2. Finally, I got them both to transmit video... only to discover that HDMI 2 was not transmitting audio! This, of course, is another deal breaker.Third, the sound on this TV is so bad that it's unacceptable... and I'm very lenient when it comes to TV audio. I understand that LEDs (and LCDs) have very little room for speakers, and you're not going to get outstanding sound from them. But this sound is so bad, it's ridiculous. The sound in all of my other TVs (including my 32\" TCL, which sounds crystal clear) is FAR superior to this unit, and I've never had a problem with any of them. Even if I crank this TV to 75%, it's barely audible and extremely tinny... and at that point, it becomes distorted, so turning it up any higher is pointless. Yes, I could hook up surround sound, but I don't want to do that... I don't want to mess with a sound system when I just want to watch a little news or something. I don't buy the theory that \"no LEDs/LCDS have good sound\", because I've had almost a dozen of them, and never had a problem like this. Again, this is another deal breaker for me.Finally, the aesthetics of this TV are severely wanting. Based on my other TCL TV, I assumed the manufacturer had high standards, but they fell apart when they designed this thing. In the photos, this TV looked really nice, but in the home... not so much. When I looked at the online pictures, I was excited to see that it had an ultra-thin bezel, with the dark graphite, brushed aluminum type appearance. But when I saw it in person, it doesn't look good... it looks flat, plasticy, and like a cheap knockoff.  Furthermore, the odd design of the power button looks hideous, draws the eye, and sticks out like a sore thumb. I suppose they were thinking it would make it easy to find (and it does)... but how many people walk up to their TV to turn it on and off? Doesn't everybody use remote controls by now? Perhaps the worst offense here is that the TCL logo on the bezel is not part of the unit itself... it's nothing more than a raised sticker- AND THEY APPLIED IT CROOKED! This is completely unforgivable, and it simply boggles my mind.Comparing this TV to the 32\" TCL I purchased, I'm forced to conclude that this company's quality went from world-leading to bottom of the barrel in only two years.For all the reasons listed above, I cannot keep this TV, despite its attractive price (I paid $481).

Now it's one thing if TCL has poor quality control and missed putting the part in the box occasionally, and a wholly different thing if managers at TCL decided to ship these TVs knowing the part is missing because they didn't produce enough or their shipment didn't come in.

It took over 2 weeks for them to send a box out.  They forgot to include a return shipping label, that took another week.  Once they finally received my TV, it took them a week to figure out that my TV was not repairable.  It took them OVER 2 WEEKS after they called me to say my TV needed to be replaced for them to send out a replacement set, but that was only because I called several times.Over 45 days after I started the warranty process, I finally received my replacement unit.  I took it out of the box and plug it in.  It was also defective!  The display had triangles on it, it had no color, and I could see the light coming out from the rear of the TV.  I called immediately and requested another TV.  After 4-5 days, they finally contacted me back and said they would send out a replacement unit.  That was 2 weeks ago.  Still has not been shipped.  No follow up.  No apologies.I have tried calling customer service.  They brush you off and promise to contact you with updates that never come.  They always claim a supervisor is not available.This has been a very frustrating ordeal.  I highly recommend that you purchase a different brand that is not TCL.

Started leaving picture imprints on the screen and such after a while, and just made the picture quality look like crap, if you know what I mean. I was on the market for a TV, and just happen to come across this beauty for $199. I had never heard of this brand, so I was kind of hesitant at first, but I figured for $200 if I don't like it or it doesn't live up to my expectations at least it's only a couple hundred bucks and not $500.I was so excited when I seen this deal I even paid the extra couple bucks for overnight shipping, so the final price was $207 and some change. When the FedEx guy first got to my house with it and I seen how easy he was able to move the box around, I thought to myself, \"Either this guy is strong as hell, or that's one light TV.\" When I signed the delivery and moved the box inside my apartment, I couldn't believe how light the box was, compared to how heavy I remembered the box being when my Olevia TV arrived back in 2007. I quickly ripped (cut) the tape on the box and removed the TV and all of the contents and hardware. The first thing I noticed was how thin the TV actually is, and how small the bezel is. I was used to the big bulky bezel on my Olevia TV, so it just looked extra sleek. Then came out the stand, and when I seen it was made of glass and how gorgeous it looked, my jaw dropped. At first I thought there was a part missing for the stand, but I was so excited I was just looking over the extra piece tucked in the styrofoam they used to secure the TV. All the screws and everything was there. Assembly was quick and easy. Once I hooked it up and seen the initial setup screen, my jaw dropped. The UI for the firmware for this TV looks nice and slick compared to my Olevia TV. One thing I did notice is the UI does respond a bit on the slow side, but that's really not an issue. You quickly get used to it.I quickly hooked my Xbox 360 up to it and I was amazed at the picture quality. I wasn't expecting such a sharp picture quality. The settings were almost spot on out of the box. I changed my color temp to a warm color temp (I hate cool colors where whites look like blues -- I like my whites to have a little red shade to them), and bumped up my brightness to 60, and everything looks great! It took me months to get the picture settings on my Olevia TV right, and even then, I wasn't quite satisfied, even as late as the day I passed it on to my Dad and Step mom (it still makes a great TV for watching shows, since the picture is always changing, just not gaming).I do not at all regret this purchase. My only gripe is the response time seems a bit high, but it's not so bad it degrades the picture quality. The only time you notice it is if you're sitting there looking for it, but otherwise, it looks phenomenal! A few days ago, I was at Walmart comparing the picture quality to the top brand HDTV's they have set up on display such as Samsung, LG and Sony, and the picture on this TV looks just as good as those TV's. If anyone is in the market for a new TV and has a limited budget, do NOT hesitate to buy this TV. It will absolutely blow you away.PS: The picture quality is so much better than on my Olevia that the first time I loaded up Halo 4 on it my jaw hit the floor at the difference in the detail I could see.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really a front runner with the big guys,", "Author": "JStuart", "ReviewID": "R2KR5KZHDLFYV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has a really exceptional picture.

The TV itself is alright for the price but if it does go out don't expect to have your warranty honored. All I get is double talk and the runaround. One more thing is that there are \"No Codes\" to program the remote for your cable company boxes. You will be stuck with having to use 2 or more remotes. Still on hold at 52 minutes.

I also have several other HD Tv's all 40\" or larger and all more expensive.  This TV simply doesn't compare to a higher end Samsung, Pansonic, LG, etc so a 4 star avg review on this is honestly not the same as a 4 star review on a $500 LED by one of the big names.A Couple of Positives-  This is ACTUALLY a 1080P on the HDMI plugs, 720P applies to the OTA HD Tuner.  You can also confirm this right on TCL's website.  HDMI does look a lot better than the OTA HD.  The sound quality is also decent relative to how small the speakers are.So why 3 stars-  Picture quality, color tone, and sharpness are simply not anywhere near what I get on say my 40\" Samsung LED that was $480.  Nor is it as good as my kids 40\" LCD Toshiba which is about $380.  I have tried tweaking every possible adjustment and although it does adjust the picture I simply can't find one that I would say is great.If you are coming from a non-HD TV to this I'm sure you will be happy, but if you think the avg of 4 stars on this is equal to 4 stars on the high end TV's you will be disappointed.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "needeen", "ReviewID": "R36D3EJSMTOBHC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Due to the price of LED tvs, I have been holding out on buying a new tv for some time.

I researched the brand and felt assured that it was going to deliver the basic features I want from a tv- HDMI ports for my blue ray and roku player, awesome picture quality, and an ultra-slim design. The tv came in an undamaged/unopened box and was quick to set-up in 20 minutes. There are not many features with the tv (i.e. no picture in picture etc), but that did not affect my decision. I also knew the speakers were going to be poor. No ultra slim tv can deliver dynamic noise like a stereo.

It said my TV doesn't support hdcp which I googled and is High Definition Copyright Protocol. Basically some bs... I don't know if it was the TV or the old crappy comcast box. I needed the two hdmi ports for the xbox and the Blu-ray player anyways so I just used the component cables for the Comcast box. There is a work around though I think. When I unplugged it from my old tv and plugged it straight into my new tv (the TCL) it worked. Unplugging the HDMI from the comcast box, and plugging it back in, was when it threw the error. I assume because of this it treated it as a new connection and performed the hdcp check. I didn't do it but if i were to plug my old tv back in and then unplug it and plug the new one back in, I bet it would work.Bottom Line:You simply CAN'T get this picture quality, thin bezel/thickness, and decent amount of connections elsewhere at this price point.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "FirefighterCin", "ReviewID": "R17SDPG1146IVZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV is serving its purpose, but definitely lacks the picture quality I thought it may have.

Speakers aren't the greatest but we hooked it up to our surround sound and it's fine.Big problem - if you have DISH, there are no codes to program your Dish remote to work with this TV. We have tried every scan, code, etc., and after trying to find info online, it's pretty clear there isn't one that will work, so we now have to use two remotes because we can't change the volume or turn the TV off without using the TCL remote. I considered returning the TV but when I came back onto Amazon, the price had come down from $518 to $499, and it was within the 14 day price guarantee, so they will refund the difference. Can't complain about that.12/12 update - switched from Dish to Directv and not only can the Directv remote sync with this TV, but the HD picture is much clearer.

I clearly saw that there were several good reviews and almost as many bad ones about quality issues that people were having.  I decided to roll the dice.  For the first 4 months every thing was good.  Hard for me to say it was \"outstanding\" as there was a lot of pixilation with HD content (granted, this could only be seen if you were within 8 feet of the TV).  For the price, nothing I would baulk at.After 4 months, the TV began to blank out (the screen turned to a fuzzy screen of \"snow\") for about 2 seconds and then it would go back to normal.  At first, this would happen about once every 10 minutes.  Now, 18 months later, it happens about once every 30 seconds and it is impossible to watch TV.  I tried to switch to a different HDMI port and same thing.  Tried running different devices (Blueray, cable, Roku) and same thing. (VIDEO: Note, that I am not changing the channel, turning the TV on/off, or anything like that.  This is what I am viewing without messing with anything)The other issue I have is that the clock would not keep time.  I would set it one day and the next day it would be approximately 20 minutes off and continue to be offset by 20 min every day.  Really?!?!  Kind of concerning.  Makes me wonder if they can't get the clock to work, how is the actually TV going to work properly?I will be making a warranty claim on these issues as I am still under the 2 yr warranty.  I'll post an update and let everyone know how that process goes.  If you decide to pull the trigger, I wish you good luck.

It seemed like a steal when I bought it then, and is still a good value at over a hundred bucks more now.Key features of this TV set include:A bright, LED-lit display with dark blacks and pretty accurate color reproductionA nice thin bezel, a cool solid-glass stand, and overall good stylingAn adequite amount of inputs, including two HDMI ports, VGA, AV, component, headphone jack, and a digital audio out portA quality remote (I figured the remote would be garbage considering what I paid)Undoubtedly, a lot of folks haven't heard of TCL, but don't let that turn you off. The company is much more common in Asia and Europe, and are really among the larger electronics manufacturers out there. Many of the products they import to the United States are marketed as RCA and other brands.

The TV is great, just a little larger than the old one.  But there's a more important point I want to make: since there are so many complaints about TCL's customer service, I'd like to relate my positive experience with both Amazon and TCL.When the old tv started misbehaving, I attempted to contact TCL customer service.  My first call went right through and the service rep suggested I try something simple and, if that didn't work, call back.  It didn't work and I called back, and got no answer.  I tried again, and again no answer. Tried other numbers and email addresses I found on line and still got nowhere.  Discouraged, I finally called Amazon, and the rep I spoke with spent about 30 minutes with me on the phone trying to contact TCL and patch me through to them.  He was successful, and the service rep I spoke with (Kay Ann) was superb.  After a quick few steps to try to identify what the problem was, TCL decided I should return the TV for repair.  They shipped a box which arrived quickly, I packed up and shipped the TV, and from then on I received frequent emails and calls from TCL:  they received tracking info; they received the TV; they evaluated the TV and determined a replacement was warranted, but they needed a few days for inventory to arrive; the inventory arrived, but they did not have a 43\" model, would I accept a 46\"? And then the 46\" arrived with very proactive communication from TCL every step of the way.I would definitely buy another TCL (I own three already).  The TVs lack many of the bells and whistles you find on more expensive sets, but they really are an excellent value.  And TCL really came through when I had a problem.  All-in-all, after a couple false starts, a far better experience than I expected.  Excellent, in fact.

An amazingly-priced 5.1 speaker system delivering crisp, smooth, vivid sound.To this I've added a Wii, Xbox 360, BluRay player, and AppleTV. Everything shows up in vivid HD picture and face-meltingly gorgeous sound, and thanks to the receiver there's no need to swap cables ever.Adding an iPad into the mix, I can stream my entire music library through AppleTV to the sound system, while mirroring visualizers to the television.

It has a glass base with a brushed metal looking bezel.  The bezel is very thin and TV overall looks very sleek.The picture quality to me looks great watching streaming movies in HD.  Much better than the 7 year old LCD TV I had in the room before.  I don't have a Blueray player in the bedroom so I can not comment on the quality of the picture in that format.The reason I give the TV 4 stars instead of 5 is because the sound quality is average to below average.  My 7 year old LCD TV sounded much better than this TV.  Sounds very tinny as if you are listening to a transistor radio.  Not a very big issue for me since this is for a bedroom and I don't listen to the TV very loudly.  However, for those using as a primary TV definitely hook it up to your AV receiver or get a sound bar.  There must be a trade-off between thin bezel design and speaker sound, since this is a common issue with most LED TVs reviews I have read.The second reason is the number of ports.  Although it states is has both component and composite inputs.  They share the same audio inputs so you can only connect the audio of 1 device.Last reason is when you switch between inputs, you have to press the input button very quickly when you get to the USB input source otherwise it puts you into another menu tree.  The only way to get out of that menu tree is if you have the original remote.  Kind of a pain when your primary remote is from your cable box or DVR.However, you can't beat the price for this 46 inch slim TV that by far looks better than an other budget TV I have seen on the market.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like", "Author": "cfast", "ReviewID": "R1HRH5A6AOQZLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my grandparents, It was an unknown brand to me but the price was right.

It has a coaxial SP/DIF output, too (Sadly, no optical).  The menus are easy and intuitive, and the volume balancing works really well! (a big deal for me). It's very light weight, and the price is definitely a plus!The picture is mostly great except when watching standard cable -- then it's pixelated pretty noticeably (not enough to make it impossible to watch, but impossible not to notice).  In its HD modes, the picture is fine.The worst thing with this TV is the placement of the ports, and the fact that the audio-in is shared between the component and composite video...The input ports:  The 2 HDMI ports are easily accessible on the side of the TV.  Unfortunately, unless you have spent the money to purchase some 90 degree or rotating HDMI cables, you cannot plug them in and route them without them being seen from the front of the TV.  It's annoying to have to see them, or spend the money to replace perfectly good cables...The other input ports are better placed for visibility, but not so good for accessibility.  The cable in port faces down, and is in a recessed part of the case -- which means you have to bend the coax pretty sharply just to get it in.  Putting that much stress on the cable while trying to screw it in was enough to have me swearing in frustration.  Likewise, with the PC video input.  The composite and component video/audio ports were not a problem -- however, because I already had a device using the component video and audio (and, as I noted above, the audio is shared with the composite) I had to plug the audio from my WII directly into the amp rather than running it through the TV with everything else.The annoyances aren't enough to make me want to return it -- but they were definitely annoying.

The directions didn't come with any kind of recommendation for a wall mount so I bought one to fit the size and when I got it home it did not fit the tv.  If you buy the one that is recommended by Amazon you can't go wrong.  The tv was easy to hang once I got the right mount.I used it in my bedroom and it is the perfect size with a GREAT picture.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "decent tv", "Author": "Lee Lehman", "ReviewID": "R3B55E4ZLVFOX2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Seems to be a decent tv.

When u see it displayed on the store it looks awesome at a glance. Really thin bezel more than most other tvs, even the expensive ones. All around really thin futuristic, clean looking TV. Has easy setup, good basic functions. The HD works fine, has plenty inputs/outputs.The real problem is it has just too much light leakage on the edges. It is normal it might have some, but it's just too much. Does not happen on brand TVs. I'm no TV technician and I just suppose its is because the edges on the screen are just to thin or most probably just poor quality lighting/panel. Maybe they have sacrificed picture quality for a thin bezel. When u watch TV the most important thing is picture quality. U can easily notice when the screen goes dark, the edges, especially the corners light up big time!! Blacks look grey and that's NO GOOD, it kills the contrast. When there is a high color image on it you can see the colours on the edges look whiter than at the center. It advertises high contrast ratio but it's really far from it in reality.I tried calibrating it many times in different settings and could never get it to look well... How it should look!I went back to the store to ask for an exchange and the one they had on display looked exactly the same even with the high light environment in the store. This eliminates the possibility that the unit was defective as they all look the same. It is a budget TV but it's no reason to sacrifice image quality. They should have sacrificed some useless function. Also the remote looks kinda flimsy. Works fine but could look way better.In conclusion you can get a way better, brand name TV with the sames specs for $50-$80 more. That's what I did. I went for a Sony BRAVIA KDL42EX440 42-Inch 1080p HDTV which I paid a $40 differential and I'm really happy with it. It's an awesome TV. What I really expected.

So, once you cannot mount the TV on the base, and have no good place to \"lean it\" or otherwise rig it up to work, you're out of luck.I called TCL customer support and, of course, had a terrible experience. The first person took down tons of personal info, TV information (serial #, model #, order date, blah blah blah) then said, \"Sorry, I can't help you. Here's another number to call.\"  I call the new number and this woman takes down ALL of my information again, then let's me describe the problem. As soon as I do, she tells me, \"Sorry this is the wrong department. Let me transfer you.\" I get transferred. Repeat process. New woman tells me \"Sorry, let me transfer you.\" I get sent to some guy's voicemail. I leave him a long message. I call back. The next customer service rep takes down my info AGAIN. They transfer me after a long wait and I get disconnected. I call back. They take down my info. They transfer me to the guy's voicemail.Sensing a customer service pattern here?Eventually I get through to a human being who seems like they can help. She keeps me on hold a long, long time and eventually returns to tell me: \"Sir, you'll need to go to a hardware store. We are out of the correct screw to ship you.\"  Wow. I ask, \"Seriously? You're joking right.\" And she replies, \"I wish I was...\"So, I have a TV that I cannot use, and customer service that will not help me. What a great deal!Let's face it: You're thinking of buying a TCL because it's inexpensive, relatively speaking, and gets decent reviews. But remember that someone is still trying to make a profit. It's cheaper because they cut corners where it counts: build quality and customer service. In the next many years you will have this TV...are those the areas YOU want to see corners cut?I'm giving this a day to see if I can still reach SOMEONE useful at TCL.
