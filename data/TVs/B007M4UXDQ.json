(160$ with warranty.) It's got a really nice, vibrant picture once you adjust the settings to your tastes. Might wish for a little more saturation. But just a tiny little bit. The sound...Well, that's pretty crap. Honestly. I'll probably invest in better speakers somewhere in the future, but it's definitely not a deal breaker. At the price I got it, it was worth it. As another reviewer said, it's a nice little gem.Also, it's great for video games. No lag as far as I can tell, but it will take some adjusting if you've never played on an HDTV this size.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "perfect little gem", "Author": "todd", "ReviewID": "R8E41FPM6CPUJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "perfect little tv, does need you to upgrade the sound though, if you have an old 2.1 computer audio system laying around that would be perfect, once you plug it in the back of the tv in the audio input you have the perfect extra tv for your home, i use mind next to my computers i have running just to keep up with sports on sat and sunday. has plenty of inputs on the back, you can used this as a computer monitor as well, has hdmi, component, rca jacks for audio and video, s video and vga.", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "It works.", "Author": "Saber", "ReviewID": "R2LUHBYKUOW6P1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's thin, light, and works well. Not a lot of features, but at 23\" it's not going to be the centerpiece of a home theater, so there. I do like that it's full backlit and 720p...I hate seeing people buy 1080p at this size, you can't possibly see the difference.I routed the sound out the headphone jack to an old 2.1 speaker system.

I have now purchased 2 of these Coby TVs from H.H.Gregg. I installed the first one and it had mono sound instead of stereo; the left speaker never came on, so the sound was ridiculously pitiful. I took that one back and made an even exchange, figuring I just got a dud the first time. I took the second Coby home, installed it, and darn if it doesn't have the very same problem. The picture is fabulous, but it sure would be nice not to strain to hear. This one is going back tomorrow and I will NOT buy another. Don't waste your time on it. Do NOT buy this TV!", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "TV broke shortly after purchase and no accommodations from seller", "Author": "Kristine", "ReviewID": "R14XTFLCVQZAHD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Coby is a less than satisfactory brand and has absolutely no concern for its customers.  My Coby 23 inch broke immediately after my warranty expired and at the same time I had barely even used it yet.  Once it broke I had to make at least 5 different phone calls to receive instructions on what to do about this matter.  A Coby representative then instructed me to bring my product to a local tv repair shop and that they would handle the matter as far as getting parts for repair from Coby but that I would still have to pay for the labor of fixing it which was already a huge annoyance to me.  After it took 2 weeks for Coby to get back to my local shop they sent an email saying that it couldn't be fixed locally and that I would have to ship it all the way to California. (I live in New York)  No one has apologized to me for the inconvenience and Coby has asked me to pay in shipping and fixing more than I even paid for the TV in the first place which was too much any way.  I will never deal with Coby again and I would advise everyone else not to as well.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007M4UXDQ"}}
