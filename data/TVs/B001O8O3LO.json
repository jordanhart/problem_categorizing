I HAVE THIS ON MY KITCHEN COUNTER AND REPLACED THE OLDER ONE WITH A PICTURE TUBE THAT TAKES UP TOO MUCH SPACE. THE PICTURE IS CLEAR AND THE SOUND IS GOOD. NOT AS GREAT AS MY SONY IN MY BEDROOM BUT THAT'S A SONY NOT THIS. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TV TO ANYONE WANTING A SMALLER TV THAT USES LESS SPACE. MY SON HAS HAD ONE OF THESE TVS IN HIS KITCHEN FOR OVER A YEAR AND LOVES IT. THIS IS WHY I BOUGHT ONE.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "good poduct", "Author": "Jesus Enriquez Mu\u00e3oz", "ReviewID": "R378C8PLW5DZ8V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good product, best for this price I guess.

The picture quality exceeds most tv's in its size and class.  It even had HDMI port for gaming sessions where I wanted to go somewhere else to play and not pack big TV.  Component cables where all included, and picture on that is great to.
