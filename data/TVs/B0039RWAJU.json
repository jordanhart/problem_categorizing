{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Picture, Connectivity has Potential!", "Author": "Prashant Sistla \"PrazVT\"", "ReviewID": "R3S62NJR17ZDD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on Amazon (from Adorama) and I've been pretty happy with it so far.  The only major issue was that the top right corner was damaged so there's a slight discoloration.  Unfortunately, I didn't catch it until after the TV was mounted and I took the plastic strips off of the frame.  Alas, returning the TV after opening it is pretty much impossible based on the store's policies.  But, that's just bad luck on my part ... still it stings a little to spend $1660 on something that's at least cosmetically flawed.  Thankfully the TV itself is fine.Beautiful picture from all HD sources - Cable, PS3/blu-ray, XBOX 360, Wii, Netflix streaming, etc.  I generally keep it on Standard mode, but I did set one of the expert picture presets using the built-in calibration feature.  Blacks are 'black' using the local dimming feature - quite effective considering this set uses a hybrid LED backlight system.  The 120hz motion feature works well and improves standard DVD picture.  I haven't really noticed much bleeding from the edges, but if there is some it's minimal.  Sound is good for such a thin TV and turning on the Infinite sound function helps.  But most of the time, I use my home theater system so it's not really a concern for me.The TV's menus are intuitive and very modern.  The Netcast features and widgets work well also.  I've watched youtube videos and they look pretty good, while Netflix movies run smoothly and look great (esp the HD ones).  My TV is connected via the ethernet port to my LAN and can access my media server.  I serve music (aac, mp3, wav, flac) and movies (XVID, 1080p / 720p h264/AC3 blu-ray rips) and normally use my PS3 to access them.  That being said, the TV's media functions aren't perfected yet.It'll only see about 10 pages of music folders (I've got 15000+ songs sorted by artist - album), and sometimes they don't show up properly.  I've used TVersity and Nero Media Home (comes w/ the TV) and had the same results.  The TV plays DiVX/XVID movies perfectly and any h264 movies that aren't profile 4.1.  Alas, my HD collection is all high profile 4.1, so the TV will start playing them and then freeze after a few seconds.  The manual in fact \"doesn't guarantee\" that these particular files will play.  So for now, I'll continue to use the PS3 for network media serving.  However, since the TV can be updated via the Internet, I'm hopeful LG will fix some of these bugs.The remote works well and the backlight button is a nice touch.Overall, I'm very happy with this TV (aside from the slight blemish on it) and I probably could have gone with something bigger :)Honestly, there are a lot of TVs to choose from now days but I think the LG has a great feature set for the price.  I'd recommend it if you're looking for a good midrange LED set with internet connectivity.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "stunning picture until it goes black,random power loss", "Author": "Samuel \"sinq 360\"", "ReviewID": "R1EGZ3HU1OQNYP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the last guy bought this LG at Fry's. In the store it looked like the most bang for the buck, when I got home setup was simple wall mounting was a breeze since its so slim and light the picture looks great in blue ray and cable HD however when I went to play my PS3 there was one issue that concerned me. When the PS3 screen goes black light bleeds through the edges most severely with the energy saving settings turned off. That is my my only complaint with this set,and I'm still contemplating if it's a big enough issue to return the set.the internet apps work well with a ethernet cable the set is wi fi ready the adpater is $70.00 one my favorite ability's this set has is the detail in witch you can adjust the picture setting's things like black level adjustment and even skin color adjustment's the sound is even pretty good considering the speakers got to be tiny cause the unit is so slim like a 1/4 inch on the frame edge maybe and inch in the middle. the apps are limited to yahoo, youtube,netflix and acouple other movie sites only so far.I have a XBOX360 as well and its never looked so good I've had several different lcd's before this upgrade to led and it makes alot of difference I still have the same issue when the screen goes totally black i may contact LG about it cause it comes with a 1 year manufactures warranty with the energy saving settings on max the light issue is hardly noticeable but it's still there none the less other then that kinda major issue this set would get 5 stars from me so I gotta give it a very worthy 4. Update 7-4-10 I've had this LG almost 2 months now i could'nt return it over the \"clouding or blooming\" after comparing it against other major brand edge lit LED sets all of them have this issue. So I've kept it now I got a new issue though were the set shuts it self off outta the blue even with the sleeptimer off .I've read some blogging about it and it seem's it may be a power supply issue I will contact LG about it and update this when I hear more.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overall satisfied; yet to find a compatible Wifi USB Adapter", "Author": "GM", "ReviewID": "RMQYXCLDLHIMK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Frys but hey, a review is a review nonetheless. For most part, I am extremely satisfied with the product. It is pretty slim and neat looking except for the red/maroon boarder (not noticeable but I would prefer all black, personal preference). Plus the logos and buttons glow white only when powered up which is awesome. The contrast ratio is 5M:1. Blacks seem pretty fine, then again I'm not an expert and I didn't have any other TV set to compare the blacks against. Where brightness is concerned, it seemed better than most of other TVs. Again this is an LED TV and pretty good for the price I bought it at. Amazon in upwards of $1600 seems a little expensive. The only thing bugging me right now is its incompatibility with most of the Wireless USB Adapters; I've tried IO gear and Linksys and the TV doesn't recognize either of them. I called LG customer care and they told me it would be compatible with LG's AN-WF100 (Can't remember exact name) or something. I haven't found a store which sells it yet, LG's website says its yet to be released. If I can find a Wifi USB Adapter which it's compatible with, I'd be pleased. Also the auto-dimming feature seems great, but not for me, the picture seems very dark in power savings mode and the blacks take a major hit, but that could be just be me. All in all happy with the purchase. 4 stars simply because the TV doesn't \"WOW\" me but for the price you can't get a 5-star product.Edit: The Wifi adapter is AN-WF100 and costs $70 at Frys. Apparently I was told the 2010 LG TV's are only compatible with LG's dongle, which is definitely a take away since other dongles cost $10 onwards. I definitely don't want to pay $70 bucks for the same thing, for the time being, I'm using the traditional Ethernet/LAN cable.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this TV if you are buying for Internet apps", "Author": "santosh kunjir", "ReviewID": "RY6JVTMS3VB3X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Do NOT buy this TV if you are buying for Internet apps.

I got it from best buy in a package w an xbox 360 which was pretty sweet and the price was fair.PROS-Slim and sleek, looks great mounted above my fireplace. touch sensitve power and volume buttons are nice also-internet apps are really cool. i can show youtube videos to my friends without have to pull out a laptop.netflix works good also but layout for searching movies could be better-Tru motion is sort a double edged sword. Looks great with animated movies like Avatar or Toy story but not as good with fast paced action films because artifact becomes more noticable. i thought i would be good with sports but u really cant see it which was dissapointing-fair price. like i said i got a xbox 360, call of duty black ops with it for 1200CONS- Refresh rate is sort of slow. really dont get that detail that u look for in sports and movies. i have to mess with the settings so many times to make the picture were i think it should be. this can really effect video games-HDMI imports are in a weird position and can effect mounting since the tv is so thin. u cant really place it flush to the wall unless you drill holes for ur cables-But my biggest compaint is the picture quality. my 50in panasonic plasma looks much better and is way better for gaming. the trick is really messing around with the settings. i prefer vivid with slighly turning down backlight and contrast to prevent bleeding and keeping color below 75. expert settings are just a waste of time. but the problem is a movie will look good with one setting but sports look bad and vice versa. I really was disapointed with the quality with Satellite HD programming. probally because most are just 1080iOverall thou it is a nice tv for the price but the picture wil not blow u out of ur seat.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG 47LE5500 47-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED LCD HDTV", "Author": "Ivan Di Stefano", "ReviewID": "R43LYCTR6N0PJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Is really thin and light and the matte screen performs well in my bright living room.

I looked at a large number of other tv brands before buying, but decided to stick with LG. I now have 2 LG HDTVs and I am very pleased with both.

The only reason I chose LG over other brands such as Sony or Samsung is because of the power voltage of the set which is supposed to be 100V ~ 240V, 50/60 Hz as stated in the summary of spec sheet as well as the pdf copy of the spec sheet found on the LG website. I came from a country where the voltage use is 240V instead of the 120V here in the US. Having a TV set with a 100V ~ 240V rating would enable me to use the set in both countries without using any converter.The TV set that I received has a power voltage of only 120V. When I called the LG customer service, I was first told by the rep that LG produced TVs that can be used worldwide with 100V ~ 240V and there must be a misprint on tag behind my TV set that says 120V and assured me that I can use the set without a problem back home. When I pushed further, only then did she decided to check with the technical department. She later said the 100V ~ 240V is only for LG plasma TVs and not for LEDs, and that the LG 47LE5500 is only rated for 120V. Now she says the misprint is on the spec sheet instead of on the tag at the back of the TV....and there is nothing that LG will do for me as it is CLEARLY stated on the spec sheet \"Design, features and specifications subject to change without notice.\" So now I'm stuck with the TV.
