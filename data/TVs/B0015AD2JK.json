{"Reviews": [{"Title": "for your viewing pleasure", "Author": "J. Nguyen", "ReviewID": "RKAFDJ7GEHPM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second review for this panel!  The first one was lost! (Frustrating it was!!!)First off Amazon has kept their promise with their Post-Order Price Guarantee.  Delivery was prompt and the white glove delivery people were like, \"This is the best condition a tv box has ever came through their shipping company\".  They did like Amazon said...they'll bring it in, unpack it, set it up where you want it and take the box away!  One of the many reasons why I shop from Amazon!Anyways, the plasma panel, PN50A550 is as good as I thought it was.  Being a techie, I tested this thing to its full potential for a couple of weeks and I have to say that I am really impressed with the capabilities of this plasma!  There are lots of great things about this plasma and I will address some questions that people have had with plasmas and this particular model...and from its predecessor, the 5084.Color and black levels:The factory settings are almost OK if you don't know how to calibrate plasmas of this caliber.  But if you can calibrate it yourself or spend money to get a pro to do it then PLEASE do so!  Each source has its own independent set of Dynamic/Standard/Movie settings... which is great because each source has a different video quality feed.  You must remember to calibrate it via the room type you have.  So for bright rooms I used Dynamic (remembering to turn off any dynamic contrast settings that will lessen the performance of this plasma).  I used Dynamic for daytime because I can utilize the DNIe+ option.  For dark/dim lighting, I calibrated it using the Movie setting.  After spending a good time on 3 sources (DVD, CABLE HD and the Wii) the video feed is mesmerizing!  I tested the settings with 300, The Incredibles and Die Hard, each movie for its different characteristics.  Remember not to use any dynamic contrasting when you calibrate, no need for it....ask any pro! (btw...don't use any of the E-Mode settings)Buzzing:There was an issue with some 5084's having a loud buzzing sound.  As of my unit, the A550 has no LOUD buzz.  It has a normal, very minute buzz that you cant even here unless your ear is to the back panel.Heat:This model is a LOT cooler to touch than the 5084.  I read it's because of the better placement of the inner \"guts\".  I have touched the sides and the top.  Of course the top is the hottest spot but this thing doesn't emit as much heat as the 5084.  That's a plus!  Less heat = less energy.Burn In/ Image Retention / Ghost images: I have TRIED to produce burn in images with the A550(remember that I have calibrated settings and not factory)...and it's really hard.  The anti-burn in settings that come with this plasma works wonders and has options to if you did have burn in, you can get rid of it.  But use your head, if your have dynamic settings on and your brightness level is 55+....you're probably are going to get burn-in.  There are so many ways to avoid it.Speakers: I only heard the speakers when I first turned on the A550.  The Samsung chime tuned its way letting me know its presence.  After that, I turned them off and used my amplifier to produce the sound to outboard speakers.  The only reason there are speakers on plasmas/ LCDs this size is because the consumer does not invest in a home theatre system right away.  I always thought....BIG pictures need BIG sound.All in all, this is a wonderful plasma.  I even think in some ways it is better than the highly praised Kuro.  I am very impressed with what this plasma has to offer and I love the way it has that \"WOW!\" factor when people see it for the first time.  I'd have to say SD channels aren't the best but they are ok for what they are.  People ask me all the time why I chose plasma over LCD?  Look at one side by side and tell me which one you want to invest your money into....plasma all the way.  .Update:I finally used the Wiselink!  I connected both a Fujifilm Finepix F50fd 12MP Digital Camera with 3 x Optical Image Stabilization and a Sony Alpha A100 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only).  It recognized both and I got to show off some pics from various shoots I did over the weekend!  Never knew how great something looked at \"poster\" image sizes!!!  The A550 is GREAT!My friend brought over his new toy, the Apple MacBook Pro MB133LL/A 15.4\" Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 200 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive), and we hooked it up!  It was one thing to show off the new mac book pro....but on the 50incher...oh my god it was awesome! PLUS PLUS PLUS!!!!Update #2,Since my last update and review, I have moved to a newer and bigger house.  I'm not sure if it was for us or just to make room for this plasma panel!The A550 is now mounted usingPeerless Universal Tilt Wall Mount for 37\"- 60\" Flat Panel Screen with one Touch Tilt.  I waited and waited and waited to purchase a PS3 for it's Blu-Ray purposes.  Playing games on it is a plus too, but I mainly got it to watch movies on.  Why not just get a Blu-ray player?  Functionality.  The PS3 allows me to have a media center and it allows me to stream movies/pictures/music directly from my PC/Laptop via TVersity.The A550 has withstood many nights of watching hdtv, 1080p movies(finally) and gaming.  My wife can even operate the thing now without me worrying about her ghosting anything on the screen.  And if there are any, the \"side scrolling\" feature eliminates it.  I have also bought a Logitech Harmony 550 Universal Remote.  The Wife got aggravated with all the remotes I had.  Now with one programmed click, it turns on the A550, the receiver and the set-top box in one infrared sweep!Did I mention yet that I still LOVE this thing?Update #3,I have meaning to update this again when the new 120hz LCDs hit the scene.  Friends and Amazonians alike have asked me how do the newer LCDs compare to the A550/plasmas in general.  Well, 120hz was introduced in LCDs to address the motion blur due to a slower refresh rate(hockey pucks, footballs, explosions, etc...don't look natural enough and sometimes pixelated).  With that said, how do the newer 120hz compare to my A550?  Even though the 120hz LCDs have improved, it still doesn't compare to this plasma.  If you want the whole package, get the A550!  Awesome color, black levels, no motion blur, contrast ratio is great.  LCD's native contrast ratio is around 2000~15000:1 with a Dynamic 100,000:1...remembering dynamic is not what you want to go by when measuring contrast levels.Another thing, I have updated the software to the PN50A550.  It's really easy to do.  You go to [...] you find the PN50A550 and download the updates.  Took me less than 5 mins to do!I can not believe it will be a year on April 4th that I have had this panel.  I enjoy it everyday...STILL!", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Couch Potato Maker", "Author": "Sky", "ReviewID": "RURIDNNBIXEU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is there really a noticeable difference between 1080i and 1080p? You bet!!! And the Samsung PN50A550S 50-inch 1080p Plasma HDTV shows off the difference brilliantly.First let me say how pleased my experience with ordering the TV on Amazon was. I ordered it on a Monday and it was delivered in 5 days...on a Saturday!Okay, back to the TV.The picture is magnificent. As I said earlier, there is a real difference between 1080i and 1080p. For the past three years I'd been watching on a 1080i maximum Hitachi Plasma, and I thought it really couldn't get much better. But it can.1080p Blu Ray discs and Playstation 3 games in 1080p are both vividly more defined on the Samsung than on my Hitachi. At this time cable looks about the same, because the highest definition that my cable company (Cablevision) is broadcasting is 1080i. You can set the Samsung's picture to Standard (for a TV placed in a normal environment), Movie (for dark rooms) or Dynamic (for bright rooms). There are (several) other settings that the factory has pre-set and all look great, but you're free to manually adjust just about everything, and on that note....I did have one issue that was really bumming me out. At the very bottom of the face of the TV is the Samsung logo, and directly below that is a relatively oversize, bluish, bright LED light that serves what purpose I have no idea...power indicator...decoration maybe? All that dumb light served to me was distraction; my eyes were drawn to it all the time, especially with the lights lowered while watching a movie. So I called Samsung and asked about it; I was sure that there would be no way to turn it off....but I was wrong! Customer service answered the phone with no wait after navigating briefly through a menu in order to get me to the TV people. The guy put me on hold for a minute and came back to tell me how to turn (what he agreed to be) \"the very annoying\" light off (the instruction also happens to be on page 67 of the User Manual). So no more annoying light!I have set the TV's speakers to off, so I can't comment on sound. I use a Home Theater receiver in a room set up for Surround; the sound connections for the two devices (an HD Cable Box and a PlayStation 3 (60GB)) that I have go directly to my receiver (I think it's this one Onkyo TX-SR605 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver).The TV has a USB port (called WISELINK) that lets you play MP3s & view pictures from a USB-flash-drive (which I'll probably never do either of on the TV), but importantly if/when Samsung upgrades the TV's firmware, you can download upgrades to a file on your PC, load the upgrade onto a USB drive and connect the USB drive to the TV to upload the upgrade (all explained in the User Manual).So I am really stoked about my new Samsung PN50A550S 50-inch 1080p TV. I try hard to get to the gym more often or just get more outside activities into my everyday routine, but this TV is gonna make a couch potato out of me for sure.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazon came through...big time", "Author": "Jolene Leslie", "ReviewID": "R36LQQ1QHUFCKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start of by making some of you feel a little better about buying a major purchase online. I was very skeptical about having this delivered safe and on-time, but the $400+ I was saving from BB, CC & other local retailers was enough to swing me. I bought my PN50A550 from Amazon on Wed. 4/16 for $1849.98. CEVA had picked it up by the end of the day and had it on its way to me.I called CEVA on Friday 4/18 at about 4:00pm and they told me the TV had arrived on the dock that morning. I'm not sure when they had planned on calling me to sched. delivery, but since they were more than friendly I ignored that minor gripe. They offered to deliver it Saturday, but my sched. was full, so i opted for Monday b/n 11-3.Sure enough they arrived at 11:01, carried it in my house, unpacked it, took the time to set it up, make sure everything worked and was in good condition and could not have left me happier.Since DirecTV never showed up the same day for their dish and receiver upgrade, I cannot comment on the HD picture as of yet, but i will be sure to post my views on the TV once they do. SD looks better than expected though; for what it's worth. And the set-up menu is easy to navigate and very descriptive. The remote has large buttons that all illuminate and the manual is very well written. It has everything you should need to know and not a lot of what you dont.One more thing...since i placed my order, Amazon has twice since lowered their price. However, i simply called in to their C.S. and they were more than happy to credit my the difference both times. I believe i have 90days that they will protect their price. Thank you Amazon...you definately came through with flying colors.**ok, HD finally hooked up and the picture quality is MIND BLOWING! Spent hrs watching discovery and animal planet. Can't wait to get ps3, although I can't imagine being much happier.Stop shopping right now...trust me, you will be happy with this plasma! Plenty of settings available if you are in to tweeeking the pq. Blacks are exactly what i was looking for. No IR, loud noises or extreme heat. The sound is good enough that you don't notice they are TV speakers. Using the CNet settings, although movie mode is pretty close out of the box. Honestly, the only complaint i have is that i waited as long as i did to decide on this one.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Defective Plasma", "Author": "Anderson A.

Upon arrival I inspected it and looked fine.  After taking a hour to set up, I enjoyed the picture for few minutes before noticing a bright line 2 pixels wide going across the middle of the screen.  It was much more noticable with lighter backgrounds.  To my great disappointment, I called the vendor and they would not ship another plasma if you accepted the shipping.  They kindly refered me to Samsung tech support.  After waiting 10 minutes Samsung refered me to a local technician.  They came over the next day and diagnosed the problem.  Apparently its a \"rare\" defect.  BTW - this tv was manufactured in Mexico, there has been alot of chatter with defective sets manufactured there, guess I was one of the unlucky ones...Another week has past, and we are still waiting for the parts from Samsung.  So almost a month later, I am still waiting to enjoy my \"new\" plasma.  This model had alot of potential, but this whole experience has been very frustrating.

Bryan", "ReviewID": "R13X72JT4VD4C0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a lot of waiting for 1080p price reductions, and debate on the manufacturer to choose, I eventually selected the Samsung over Panasonic based on the price available through Amazon.  Usual excellent Amazon delivery service - the screen was installed by the delivery company and was working before I arrived home.  Picture quality excellent, connectivity more than adequate, USB port is a neat touch - easy to show photos on the screen.  Sound quality through the onboard speakers is frankly rubbish, but that's not why you buy a plasma screen is it?  I will hook up a surround sound system soon so sound is not really an issue.  All in all, excellent quality at a bargain price.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sammy vs. Panny", "Author": "W. Moore", "ReviewID": "R20GCL9U3AV4SD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Research:So after 3 months of research, reading reviews, and lurking the avsforum, I had finally narrowed it down between the 2008 Samsung line or the Panasonic line.  This is a condensed comparison between what I was able to gather about the two lines:Samsung:The plasma 550 and 650 have the potential to produce the most accurate colors.  This means that after a proper calibration you are going to see the colors as the director/post-production crew want you to see.  By comparison, the Panasonic line (80u, 85u) are going to have a slight \"red push.\"  This will be most noticeable on flesh tones, which will make people appear more pink or red than actual.  This is supposedly because Panasonic's research found that test groups preferred a slight \"red push.\"  I would withhold judgment until you see it for yourself, you just might like it.  Either way, unless you are a videophile (in which case you'd be looking at the Pioneer pros anyways) you aren't going to notice this unless you plan to have two different plasmas in your room, side-by-side.Panasonic:The 80u and 85u are going to have the best \"black levels.\"  This means that these panels are able to produce a couple deeper shades of black than the Samsung 550 or 650.  This will be most noticeable in darker scenes or scenes where shadows dominate the screen.  Again this is something that you will not notice unless you are a videophile or compare the two side by side (probably in very dark room).  I believe that the Panasonic's supposedly have a better filter to avoid reflections in a brightly lit room.The Decision:The most crucial deciding factor for you should be your personal taste.  Don't let all the marketing numbers or even professionally measured numbers sway your decision.  You are going to be watching the TV, not the numbers on the side of the box.  The same goes when your friends come over to watch the game or play games.  My best advice for you is to go to a brick and mortar store (Bbuy, Ccity, etc) and compare the panels that you are interested in.  Play around with the remote and settings if you can.  While the store lights offer less than ideal lighting, you should be able to form an opinion and leave here knowing which TV you want.  I left the store knowing that I either wanted the 550 or 650 and after checking my finances and wanting to buy a PS3 and home theater system, I decided to go with the 550.I am willing to bet that if you buy any of these panels, you will be very happy.  The money that you save buying through Amazon (in my case anyways) can go towards things like a PS3 or a home theater system (or BOTH).CEVA Delivery:After reading so many horrible things about CEVA delivery, I was downright petrified.  I decided that despite my fears, the cost difference between Amazon and a b&m; store was more than enough to console me.  I ordered my PN50A550 on Tuesday, August 19 2008 at approximately 9 PM EST and Amazon shipped it on the 20th with an estimated delivery date of the 19th.  Whatever you do, don't trust the CEVA tracking or Amazon's tracking information.  By Monday (the 25th), my tracking information still only had one line which read shipment received by carrier.  So I called my local CEVA facility (found at cevalogistics.com, world directory bottom of the page) and asked if my package was there and to schedule the delivery.  The guy got my phone number and told me that the delivery driver would call me.  The next day (26th) the delivery driver called me and scheduled a window of 12-4pm on Wednesday, August 27th.  I asked him if he could call me before he got there and he told me he could call 30 minutes before.  He called at 3:30 the next day and I left work to meet him.  Sure enough at 4:05 pm the TV was sitting in my living room.  The CEVA guy had a checklist where I had to initial saying that he unpacked the tv, it appeared to be in good condition, and that it turned on and displayed a good picture.  A 5 business-day turnaround, not bad, especially when I saved about $500 not buying it in a b&m; store.", "Date": "August 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung & Amazon Deliver", "Author": "C. J.

This wasn't a quick decision, a lot of web time research went into it.  I couldn't be more pleased with the product.  Setup was a breeze and the \"tweaking\" is fun.  The picture is awesome and the set's features (even when not in use} are incredible.This is my second plasma TV and I wouldn't go any other way.  The richness and depth of color and lack of \"ghosting\" that is so prevalent with LCDs make the choice so obvious.I'm running DISH's HD package, a DVD HDD recorder with HDMI output (Philip's), a PS3 (with the BLU RAY player - sweet), an XBOX 360, and an IPTV unit for Skyangel broadcasts.  First three take up the 3 HDMI inputs and the last two are run through components.  Everything is being run with optical cables through a Samsung 800 watt 5.1 surround sound system.  I also set everything up so that I can also use the TV's speaker system instead if I so desire.  All that to say that the 550 handles it all so easily and the menu navigation is very intuative.  I could not be more pleased with this TV.This is my first experience with Amazon and I'd highly recommend them for purchases of this kind.  Even though I ran into a glitch with the \"white glove delivery...NOT, they were so accomodating to make everything right with me and have succeeded.  No complaints with Amazon; they've been incredible.  CEVA...well...that's another story.  Should mention that there was also a price reduction on this TV twice in two days and Amazon immediately credited my account when I called them.  Also, the price was a real incentive, deeply discounted, at least for where I live.I'll shop Amazon again.  Pick this TV if you're looking for an above average plasma HD TV at a fair price.  You won't be disappointed (check out all the other reviews at this site.UPDATE 10 DAYS LATER:Having run my 550 through a 100 hr. break-in period, I've now set up all my settings apart from a professional calibration (while it would be nice you don't need to spend $400 to get an awesome picture).

Gill", "ReviewID": "RQ17T96PQGT1H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll start off by saying that i dont know much about HDTV. I have been using HD cable box on a 30\" Samsung picture tube HDTV (1080i). I did like that picture and the sound on my connected surround sound. When i saw that best buy had 3 yrs, no interest financing, i just had to go for it, even though i found no reviews for this particular samsung model/tv. I saw reviews for the older models from samsung on different websites, so assuming that THIS tv has to be an improvement i told my family to buy it, and i also bought it for myself. Being a plasma i am still in the process of breaking the tv in. I reduced the brightness, cell light to 50% and 5. The only thing/control that is around normal is contrast at 90%. I saw Lord of the Rings on \"TNT\" HD and all i have to say even with my toned down setting for the tv till the breakdown period (approx 200 hrs)is OMG. The picture was just amazing, really it was as compared to the picture tube hdtv. Maybe its the bigger size but it did blow me away. Regardless of size, the colors, black levels etc is what i looked for. I am not sure how the experts will rate this TV as, but i am very happy with my purchase. Its money well spent and i'll be happy for years to come. This TV does let you change advanced settings for picture if you so choose. I skipped on the professional calibration. Some folks may want it, and rightly so, but i believe that i can get the picture which suits me, in my house for my needs.I will probably have to update my review after the break in period. By the break in period i just mean to keep the settings low for the first 200 hrs approximately.I am enjoying my TV and it seems darn good. I hope and am sure that you'll enjoy the performance of this tv if you choose to buy it. I do belive in Samsung, that they are creating a world class product. I just dont see the need of spending twice the $ for a pioneer plasma. I am sure its a little better but not value for the $ as the Samsung provides.Update a week later: Yes, the tv is performing more than what i expected. Also check the best buy website for more reviews for this particular tv. I am not the only one blown away by it.UPDATE AFTER A MONTH: This TV has blown me away. More than what i could have expected from a big screen tv. I had been leaning for a LCD tv, but when i saw this, anyway i am SOOOOOO GLAD i bought this TV.I agree with another reviewer here, to calibrate your TV but according to your viewing conditons. This TV has been well reviewed by other websites, but you should calibrate as you deem the picture to be fit to YOUR eyes. Yes, disable all electronic anhancements and then change the numerous setting available on this TV for as you deem fit.The only thing i can't comment on too much is sound. I usually use my surround sound but do have to listen to the tv speakers when using with my dish network connection. I have HD cable from time warmer along with SD dish network. Of course the SD picture doesn't compare with the HD picture but this TV does much better in showing me SD that a older SD picture tube TV i was originally using for the dish network connection.In the end, awesome picture, very good sound, excellent price for this TV from samsung and the fact that it's Samsung, should make you feel confident in spending your hard earned $'s on a TV.Good luck, i am sure that you'll enjoy and love this TV if you choose to buy this.", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Incredible Picture, Incredible Value, Great Shipping", "Author": "dmetkid", "ReviewID": "R2HYIHDWR1SZYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Samsung PN50A550 for about a month now and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  First of all, I was looking into the Panasonic TH-46PZ80U 46-inch plasma purely based on recommendation from a family member that just got a Panasonic Viera and raved about the price and the picture. I also looked at Consumer Reports and it had good reviews.  I was dead set on buying the Panasonic and decided to just go to a showroom and compare the picture myself before I bought it.  My wife and I quickly realized that the picture was not as impressive as some of the other TVs, including the Samsung PN50A550.  We even played with the Panasonic's picture settings, but could not get it to look as good as other displays.  So, discouraged that I now needed to do more research, I checked Consumer Reports again and see how the Samsung PN50A550 ranked...I was dumbfounded when I saw that the PN50A550 was rated the best overall score and picture quality tested by Consumer Reports for plasmas in the 50-inch category.  How did I miss this?! So I went back to the showroom, and sure enough, I was sold.  The picture was incredible! I even changed the settings to match the 50A650 (the one with the \"Touch of Color\" feature), and could not tell the difference between the two that were both playing the same football game, side-by-side. The next step was the price...the cheapest I was able to find at the CC's, BB's and other more regional showrooms was in the $1600 - $1700 range, before taxes and shipping.  Amazon by far had the best price when I ordered, $1550, no tax and \"white glove\" shipping was included.There was another electronics house selling the same TV through Amazon for $50 less, but I had read lots of unsettling reviews about post-ordering-pressure-tactics and poor shipping from some of the other non-Amazon houses.  Let me tell you, Amazon went through CEVA for delivery and they were great!  It was all worth the extra $50 to avoid the aggravation and have some peace of mind.  Amazon estimated 2 weeks for me to receive the TV, which I was ok with since I wasn't in a hurry...CEVA had it at my door in one week, exactly when the CEVA tracking site said it would be there.  They even called ahead of time to schedule the exact time of delivery, which was a nice surprise since I didn't know if they were just going to leave a tag on the door if I wasn't there at 2 in the afternoon. The TV was delivered in perfect condition and the delivery guys went right to work getting it out of the box, set up on the stand and hooked up to verify it worked properly.Overall, I highly recommend this Plasma television.  Great in a big room where it's kiddie-cornered for viewing from a large L-shaped couch as the picture is perfect from most any angle.  No glare issues either!  I also highly recommend going through Amazon directly.Thanks Amazon!", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome Plasma", "Author": "C.

BY FAR the Samsung PN50A550 gave me the most bang for my buck. I purchased it and got 2 cash refunds thanks to Amazon's 30-day price match policy.As for the TV...I narrowed it down pretty quickly to Samsung and Panasonic Plasmas. After reading reviews on cnet.com I discovered that the Samsung PN50A550 beat the Panasonic Viera TH-50PZ800U in several categories. I even went to Best Buy and looked at the tv's side by side and thought the colors and picture on the Samsung were better...and for $600 cheaper! I don't care about deeper black levels. It's not worth an extra $600 for something I can't notice. So I bought the Samsung.The TV has 3 HDMI, the HD picture is amazing, comes with 1080p (and I haven't even watched Blu Ray on it yet) and the standard picture quality is good too. Be sure to read the comparison between 1080p and 720p The TV volume is just fine but we hooked it up to an Onkyo 7.1 surround sound system (the best surround sound for the money IMO) and now it's just unbelievable! We also mounted the TV on the wall and it looks really nice. I checked out the Samsung's with the \"Red Touch of Color\" and didn't like it. The PN50A550 looks like a sleek black TV and even the on/off, channel, and volume buttons on the right side are camouflaged into the TV and aren't really buttons but seem like sensors that once you lightly touch the TV turns on/off. The TV is just awesome!No matter what TV you buy, make sure you don't spend $100 on the monster or other expensive HDMI cables as it's all just a marketing ploy. A simple $5-$10 HDMI cable will work just as well (after all...it's a cable!) I bought a 15ft HDMI cable for $10 and it works perfectly.", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Great Buy", "Author": "Mark Trine", "ReviewID": "R1QVU10I1DPXOU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent many months researching and shopping before picking this unit. I considered DLP, LCD and plasma very closely; weighing the pros and cons of each technology and then comparing the best products from various brands.Why did I eventualy choose plasma?DLP - biggest bang for the buck as far as size goes. Now while I do wholeheartedly believe that size matters in a display, I found many of the same flaws in DLP projection sets that I found in the old big screens of yesteryear - rather a dim and desaturated picture coupled with a lack of sharpness. Add to this the fact that rear projection sets are a dying technology and non-LED DLP sets have a lamp that will eventually burn out to cost me money, it is obvious why that choice was crossed off the list quickly.LCD - definitely has the sharpest picture plus no worres about screen burn. Add to that a good level of energy efficiency plus a relatively light weight unit and it's definitely something I consdered closely. But when viewed next to a plasma set the colors just weren't as vivid on even the best models. Black levels are of course leaving something to be desired. Then comes sticker shock: the best LCD's cost almost twice as much as this model of plasma. And even with the new 120hz refresh rates that are so touted by the advertising hype hustlers, they still suffer from motion blur.Plasma - deepest blacks and most vivid colors. Best cost to size ratio second to DLP. No motion blur. But worries about ghosting and burn in. And not as energy efficient as LCD.I decided to take a chance on plasma and couldn't be happier.I picked this unit due to its superior picture, simplicity of design and great price point.Compared to the Panasonics this unit presents a better value and a superior image quality. Compared with the other Samsung (PN50A650) it has the same image quality and a better value. The only thing that the latter model Samsung has over this is an improved anti-reflective screen (more on that later) and an additional HDMI input.Being as though I will be keeping my room dark, the reflection issue wasn't a concern. And three HDMI inputs is more than enough for me at this time considering I only have a Blu Ray player and cable TV to worry about. No reason to spend more money just for an additional input and better anti-reflection.Now as for that reflection issue so often reported on plasma TV's, I have found it little bother. In fact it's less noticeable than it was on my old CRT unit. And if you're comparing it to LCD, keep in mind that the newer LCD screens which can boast near plasma like color saturation and black levels also have very reflective screens. Matte screens are a great choice if they are something you want, but keep in mind that you will be trading off for losing some of that picture quality.For those of you still on the plasma fence and worried about ghosting and burn-in, my experience thus far is that you've nothing to fear so long as you don't leave the TV on all night with a static image on the screen. So far I've spent a good hour or so on the computer, watched several 4:3 sources, and several letterboxed widescreen films - all with no issues whatsoever. I run the pixel shift function when I can. I also switch over to the auto scrolling feature after I finish watching something or using the computer just to make sure. I've yet to see a hint of ghosting. And this is on a brand new unit. It's said that plasmas are most susceptible to ghosting and burn in when they're in their first one hundred hours of use. That makes me even more confident in this unit as the weeks and months go by.In use:The menus and setting are fairly easy to understand. The remote is backlit and well laid out, with large number buttons and the function buttons are easy with which to familiarize yourself. I especially liked that there is a picture size button that allows you to change aspects without having to enter any complicated array of settings to go through.The not so great:A lot of reports have come out that these units run hot. They do. Standing close to this TV definitely gives you a noticeable heat. But then it's not often that I'm standing within two or three feet of it, so I don't notice. But in a small room that is poorly ventilated or non-air conditioned you may want to consider that factor before you purchase.Another common complaint people have for this TV is a slight hum. I can confirm this is also true. But it's not loud at all and you won;t even notice it unless you're in a very quiet environment and the sound is muted. Otherwise you won't know it's there.The speakers aren't amazing. But be realistic: you're about to spend over a thousand dollars on a 50\" 1080p television and you don't have a proper surround sound system waiting for it? You're going to watch Blu Ray movies with TV speakers? You know you aren't! Honestly if I could have opted to have no speakers on this unit (and no tuner for that matter) and save some money on the price tag, I would have eagerly done so. I really only tested the speakers just because I read so many complaints about them. Otherwise I have them turned off and doubt I will ever use them. I'm sure most of you will be doing the same.All in all, very satisfied thus far.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung PN50A550", "Author": "J.

And I was pretty much between picking this set up or the Panasonic PZ80 model.  After much research I concluded that many opinions viewed that the Samsung has more color accuracy and more tune-able options vs the Panasonic.  So I went with this one.  The advice I have with people researching televisions is that do not rely too much on peoples reviews and opinions and go check out the television yourself...preferably with your bluray/ whatever source you are going to watching most.  Many people are nitpicky about things that most people can't even see(especially people over at AVS forums).  But I digress.  The TV is awesome..comes included with a swivel stand which some people might not need.The only nitpick thing I have with the TV is that reflection is so evident in this model.  So if you have this placed in front of a window or have lights in front of the tv you will see your reflection.  I knew this going in but did not know it would be this bad...since I came from a LCD background.  Also don't get into the hoopla of 1080P...if it fits your need then buy it...if not just get a 720P set and save some bucks for xmas.  All in all it is what I expected.But a recommendation, Amazon is no longer doing pricematch of themselves and they dropped $100 dollars within 30 days since I bought it.  They will not refund my money which they changed their policy in September..how convient on their part.  I will not make big purchases on Amazon anymore because of this.

I was originally in the market for a 46\" LCD, but a fantastic deal came on this 50\" plasma, and I am really glad I went for this instead.The TV picture is absolutely mesmerizing. I feed in Verizon FIOS HD, and an XBOX 360 (HDMI) and the results are absolutely incredible! The colors are fantastic, and with minimal adjustment the contrast and colors are great. I also had some concerns about the sound on the set, however it is actually much better than I had figured it would be. I know that some of the more expensive sets, like the Panasonic Viera also have woofers built into the set, but the sound on this TV is good. Its obviously not on the same level as a dedicated surround sound system, but it is really as good as any other built-in tv speakers.I also had questions about lag, which I really cant find any appreciable amount of, thankfully, even with video games and tv out (through a DVI-HDMI cable) from my computer. Also, I found the black levels were great after minor adjustment, and, for me, the reflectivity of the screen is not an issue, even with sunlight bouncing off of the wall behind me.For me this TV really has changed they way I watch TV, and I think its a great thing. As far as any possible negatives, I would say the only thing I wish this TV had was the extra features of the 6-series tv sets. The two extra features I wish this had was 1) Wiselink Plus: This TV has Wiselink, where the 6-series has Plus, and Wiselink Plus gives the TV the ability to play xvid video from any usb source, whereas standard Wiselink does not do video (only does music and pictures). 2) Ethernet connection for the RSS widgets - this is probably fairly useless, but it would be an interesting extra feature to have. But in all honesty, I wouldnt use either feature enough to warrant the extra couple hundred bucks.In summary, I took a gamble buying this set. I didnt even have a chance to look at it in person as a deal came along and I pounced on it over the phone, and so I was extra nervous when I finally got the set, but I am very happy with the result. When I finally got to compare this set to others in the store, I found that while the set did look slightly dull compared to some of the eye-searing LCDs, in the actual home this set looks clear, crisp, and you would be able to watch this set for hours without burning your retinas out like with some of the over-contrasted ultra bright \"popping\" LCDs.", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best yet", "Author": "L.

I knew that if I waited until holiday times, prices would drop even further than earlier this year.  This television is now $400 cheaper than at my local big box retailers (plus free shipping and the added benefit of no sales tax.)  Needless to say, add the easy financing and it's quite the sweet deal.  CNET likes this TV, Consumer Reports rates it their \"Best Buy\", and loads of people on Amazon (myself included) love it.  Compared to other 50\" plasmas I \"test-drove\" at my local retailers...this one had the best color and picture.I've had the TV for a week now, and like many of the reviews on Amazon, I have nearly all positive feedback on this gorgeous TV.  The High Def channels on cable look beautiful - sharp when it needs to be sharp, excellent motion capturing (no jaggies).  Regular (non HD) digital cable channels look good.  Most of my standard def. channel watching is limited to Comedy Central and Turner Classic Movies - and the picture quality is good - a little fuzzy when placing your nose up to the plasma, but from 8-12 feet away it's barely noticeable - no blurrier than my old Sony WEGA TV that this set replaced.  This set has excellent color reproduction, including flesh tones (which can be adjusted if necessary).  CNET and others say that the black levels are sub-par.  Well, they're not the best (like some of the high-end brands) -- but they're more than adequate, and with some easy tweaking of the television's settings, I've gotten over it.  Black Levels weren't a deal-breaker for me.  Coupled with a Blu-Ray player (with 1080p upscaling for regular DVDs) - movies are so crisp, real-to-life, and a joy to sit back and watch.  Coincidentally, I bought my TV during a Black Friday promotion which gave away the Samsung BD-P1500 1080p Blu-ray Player for free, which was hard to argue with.  Sadly, that deal is no longer around, but the Samsung BD-P1500 makes for a decent entry-level 1080p Blu-Ray player (and is also a CNET pick for Blu-Ray players under $250.)All my audio runs through an existing Sony A/V Receiver (I only use 5.1 surround sound, though could use 7.1 if I bought two extra speakers), and all of it is connected using Digital Optical Cables.  This TV should probably not be used with its existing (hidden) speakers - invest in a surround capable receiver and give this stunning picture some stunning audio to match.  Let's face it - this TVs built-in speakers can never do the picture justice.Adjusting the picture was easy via the TV's onscreen menus, and the out-the-box settings needed very little color tweaking.  The remote control is backlit, and I find it pretty intuitive.  Should you need to change the aspect ratio of the picture (especially on some of the old Cinemascope movies on TCM) - it can be done with one button on the remote.  I also updated the television's firmware by downloading the firmware onto a portable USB flash drive and connecting it directly to the TV.  That process was also easy with the instructions from Samsung's website.I've mounted my television to the Techcraft Solution Series TRK50B TV Stand - which is exactly as wide as the television.  It mounted easily to the stand, and concealing (most) of the cords was easy.  The TV itself is one of the prettiest around: a high gloss black bezel, no speakers to be seen, and very little adornment other than the Samsung logo at the bottom center.  The blue light under the television can be turned off permanently (it isn't really distracting, but I prefer it not visible.)  When using the standard stand that comes with the TV, it sits very low to the counter.  One reason I chose the Techcraft stand/furniture was because the TV could be high enough off of the counter to fit electronics directly underneath.My den is very dark, so I haven't had any glare issues.  I can even watch TV with overhead lights and a floor lamp on and I don't see any glare.  But, if this TV is going opposite a wall of full-sun windows, invest in some black-out curtains.I'm ecstatic about this television.

My HT is heavy on the sound side as I started out in life as an audiophile. I am very detail oriented and discriminating when it comes to all electronics.This TV is all it was said to be and more. The first thing that just blew me away were the black levels. Compared to the \"old\" Pioneer, it was just simply in another world all its own. The Pioneer had a beautiful picture but I had no idea what I was missing in black level. I do not own an HD or BluRay yet so I am feeding with component for the DVD and come straight out of the wall with TWC feed.The picture was great out of the box but got better with some fine tuning. The anti-reflective coating is actually very good. Yes it will show some reflection because it is flat and smooth but the AR coating is definitely there and working.User interface is well laid out and intuitive to use. Settings are good except for choices of screen size/type. There could be a couple more choices that would really be useful to reduce the horizontal bars without distorting the picture so badly. The remote is excellent! Made like all remotes should be... with a backlight. The choice of gloss black is questionable but it doesn't affect its function.This thing picked up most of the digital feeds from TWC all on its own once set to do an automatic scan and channel setup. The HD channel feeds are just awesome!!! I will not be paying for a converter box in this room!For the price, this thing is just a steal. But, I would say that taking into account I paid $4,500 for the Pioneer 7 years ago and it had no tuner functions.

My family stepped up from a 3 year old 44\" Panasonic LCD when making this purchase.First of all, the television is very stylish using the supplied stand.  There are a few ties on the back of the TV to help you hide your cables, which work well.  The power on, input, menu, and volume buttons located on the front of the TV are remeniscent of the buttons on the front of a PS3.  Touch sensitive and very subdued.  All and all a very attractive set.As for performance, this Samsung is excellent.  When researching this purchase, screen-glare and black-level were occasionally mentioned as negatives.  My set is located in my living room, with 2 large windows to the front and side of the set.  Glare is not an issue until the sun is low enough in the evening to shine directly on the set, at which point I draw the curtains closed.  As for the rest of the day, neither light from the windows or light from the bulb on the ceiling cause any problems whatsoever.  The glare issue has been exaggerated in my opinion.As I said earlier, I am stepping up from a 3 year old LCD.  Black level, as far as I'm concerned, is good.  I realize that this is no Kuro, but when I watch a film in a darkened room, the blacks sure as hell look black to me.With the perceived negatives out of the way, I'll run down some things that have impressed me:-First, and most important, is the picture quality.  It's awesome.  Movies I'd seen on my old TV look strikingly better on this set.-Picture customization is a dream, letting you tweak any setting imaginable.-Burn in is non-existent.  NON-EXISTENT.  Not a single instance.  Not even for a second.  Use common sense about static images and you'll be fine.-Being able to append descriptions to inputs (such asBlu-ray, Game, and Cable box) is fantastic.  It's also helpful for those not so tech-savvy members of the family.-Power on/off is very fast.-Hitting info at any time will tell you the resolution of the incoming signal. (1080p, 1080i, 720p)  Very useful.-No buzzing from the television, as I've seen reported elsewhere.-Firmware updates via a side USB input.  I've installed the two that have been supplied by Samsung.  Always nice to see your product receive updates.Having mentioned all of those, I'll again state that the picture quality is amazing.  It's the single most important performance factor of a television, and Samsung nailed it with this model.  Accurate color, sharp picture, deep (enough) blacks.  Fantastic.Despite the 5 star rating, there are a few minor drawbacks:-The supplied remote control is not universal.  Not a big deal, but a shortcoming nonetheless.-The stand IS a little wobbly.  A couple of toddlers jumping up and down in front of your set will give it a noticeable front-to-back shake.  It's a small one, but still worrysome.-I've heard tell that the speakers are subpar, but I've never used them.  Our set is hooked up to an A/V receiver.So there you have it.  You can get this model for peanuts right now, and I'd recommend doing it if you're still on the fence.

I found the Samsung PN50A550 had among the best video, unless you want to spend several grand more on higher end TV's.I did find that as of now, the plasma's had a far better picture quality than the LCD's. The contrast was more superb and there was no lag time when the picture changed fast as there was with the LCD's.  When looking at the clarity of the picture in the specs, one thing you want to look for is the \"contrast ratio\".  I found most TV's had a 10,000:1 listed for their contrast ratio but not the Samsung.  The Samsung PN50A550 has a 30,000:1 contrast ratio and trust me you can tell it too because the pictures are really sharp.I ordered this and received the Amazon White Glove Delivery Service for free, and I was IMPRESSED.

The picture is excellent, and HD signals are reproduced with incredible accuracy and color.  Although the built in speakers are just average,  I would not expect more.  You really need external speakers to improve the sound quality.  I use an analog RCA stereo cable out to an NAD receiver powering some decent quality book shelf speakers, and the sound is excellent.  I expect that a good home theater set up will be even better, taking advantage of HDMI connectivity and surround sound.The only real complaint, and it is minor, is the antiglare performance, which is poor.  We have a bank of three windows on the opposite wall from the TV, and on bright sunny days, the reflection from those windows is a significant distraction.  You can train your eyes to \"look through\" to the scene on the TV, but I will need to buy simple light blocking roll down shades for those windows.  The glare is not a problem at night, on cloudy days, or if you view the TV from an angle where you cannot see the window reflections.Overall, I give this set 4.5 out of 5.  The deduction is for the ineffective anti glare.  Otherwise, I am very happy with this TV, and have no regrets.

I'm a technophile and gadget lover but am rarely an earlier adopter, opting to let the bleeding edge consumers play \"beta tester\" before spending my hard earned cash.  I took my time stepping into the world of HD, the end of the format war and overall high-def content availability increase being the final event to push me toward purchase.And so, after much reading and even more deliberation, the decision was made to purchase this Samsung PN50A550.  The folks over at avsforum.com were beyond helpful in explaining their experiences and comparisons with higher-end models in detail - I highly suggest visiting that site if you haven't already.On to the TV. First, shipping.  It was shipped extremely fast, and was delivered by CEVA several days sooner than the expected delivery date.  I was called beforehand by a friendly staff member to schedule a time.  The delivery men were quick and courteous and arrived at the beginning of the time window I selected.  They unboxed the set for me, placed it on my TV stand, turned it on and let me inspect it both physically and functionally. They suggested I keep the materials for a few days to rule out any problems.  Very happy with the shipping!Next, the TV itself.  This is my first HDTV, upgrading from a 27\" Sony Trinitron I purchased in 2000.  Needless to say my jaw dropped when it was unboxed and placed on my television stand.  This set is just absolutely GORGEOUS when it's off and standing on it's own.  I was worried about it seeming ominously large, but it's perfect!  I don't have cable (yet) so I hooked up my PS3 via HDMI, which I purchased for this occasion and threw in a Blu-Ray demo disc...Now, I would say that I was blown to bits by the image - and I was - but there seemed to be something 'off' that was distracting me.  I knew that the set needed to be calibrated a bit but I couldn't place my thumb on what seemed strange.  I waited until later that evening when the sun went down (I have lots of windows) and put in BATMAN BEGINS on Blu-Ray to scrutinize.  I used the CNET suggested settings and began to criticize the picture.  BATMAN BEGINS is a pretty dark film and probably not a good movie to use when criticizing black levels, brightness, etc.  However, after tweaking the settings to my own liking I started to realize what I was perceiving; it was the very same perceptual shift that occured when I switched from CRT monitors to flat-screen LCD monitors.  It's just a whole different type of light, and a very different experience overall.  One of my first revelations happened when I played a game in HD (Devil May Cry 4), which is only 720P but showcases the sharpness, brightness and color this set is capable of.  Ratatouille on Blu-Ray even more so!Since then I've watched numerous films on both DVD and Blu-Ray and am continually blown away by how great this TV is.  For the price ($1700 when I purchased) there is nothing that comes close.  The black levels are excellent, the calibration controls are suberb - everything about it from the menus to the exterior just spell quality.  I'm really turning into a Samsung fanboy!  I still find myself tweaking settings here and there (I never move from \"Movie\" mode, as all the others seem to blow the image out too much and lose detail) and am debating having it professionally calibrated, but I've arrived at some overall settings that work beautifully for everything from downloaded HD content, to video games, to blu-ray and DVD (from drama to anime).Even though I've had the set for one month, I'm still under my first 100 hours of use so I always stretch everything to Wide-Fit and am careful not to leave anything up on the screen.  I have had some slight IR that had me a little worried initially, but realized that only stays there until an image is displayed or the burn protection features are used (example, if you use the TVs menu for a number of minutes, then view a pure black screen, there is slight ghosting.  Playing a few seconds of a movie washes it clean away).All in all, I have to give this 5 stars - for both Samsung and Amazon.com.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Terrific HDTV - Definite 'Wow!'

Initial issue is Samsung used cheap capacitors in their TV's from 2007-2009 and since it was out of warranty, I took the back off and found a couple of capacitors that were slightly \"bulged\".  Looked online and found an easy fix ($20) where you can replace the capacitors with better ones (longer life) as this was typical in early models (Video on You Tube).  Unfortunately this didn't fix the problem and still having the same problem. Samsung referred me to a local TV repair and they are talking $800 to replace the motherboard (I paid $1700 for the TV).  DO YOUR RESEARCH! When I looked at TV's, This was a \"best buy\" from Consumer reports, and that's why I bought it.  When this TV worked, its was outstanding (HD picture quality, ease of use, good looking TV, etc...)

Research included reviews here on Amazon, other websites, both consumer and professional reviews, as well as Consumer Reports ratings (this Samsung rated highest among 50 inch and up plasmas).After having the set in my home for about 3 weeks now, I have to say I'm very pleased.  The key is the picture quality, which is really quite remarkable when the input is the best.  That's something I've learned about HDTV - all HDTV is not created equal.  Some of the HD channels are amazing, others are great, but not quite up to the standards of the best.  But with the best HD input, this set performs well.One of the things the Consumer Reports review noted is that this set handled standard definition well.  It does OK with most channels, but HD sets just don't display standard definition well.  I have a smaller HD set in my bedroom, and I have the same issue with it.  Tube TVs just do most analog or digital standard defintion better.The set up was quick and easy.  I did have to adjust the color marginally - there was a bit too much pink/red in the picture, but that was easy to do.  I like some of the special features this set has - including the USB port, which enables me to view pictures on the set with the set's software, and when you shoot digital 16 X 9 pictures and view them on this TV, it's remarkable.A tip - buy your HDMI cables to hook up the TV to your digital satellite or cable receiver online through Amazon or someplace else, because they'll be cheaper.  Don't waste money on expensive cables - most brand name HDMI cables will be just fine.  I wish I'd purchased my cables when I bought the set, or even when I picked up my HDTV box from the cable company.  The cable company would have charged $25 to buy a 6 foot HDMI cable, but I thought surely they'd be cheaper at WalMart. The Philips cable I bought at Walmart was $34, and I've seen HDMI cables online for much less.About the only thing that's a challenge, and not a huge one by any means, is the reflections off the screen.  On a brighter image, it's not an issue, but if there's a lot of dark in the image, you can see lamps reflecting, or sunshine, depending on the configuration of your room.  The image on the screen is plenty bright, it's just the reflections off the screen that can be annoying.There are plenty of inputs and outputs on the set to configure to your best use with your other hardware.All in all, a great purchase, and the savings buying on Amazon amounted to several hundred dollars with the price of the set, the free shipping, and the tax-free purchase, over buying at one of the national big box chains.", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture", "Author": "Steven F.

After hooking it up to satellite I was impressed but for grinns I decided to test the TV's tuner with a set of old rabbit ears.  I live in a fairly remote area (MT) and can typically pick up about 4 channels so I wasn't too hopeful.  It detected 10 which I figured would be snowy and unwatchable and I was right about 6 of them but I was amazed when I found a digital feed.  I cant believe the HD picture of the broadcast channel.  This truely is an amazing picture.  My inlaws have a 52 inch Sony Bravia with HD Cable and I am sorry but this TV has much truer colors and lifelike picture.  They paid over 4000.00 for their sony and I picked this up for 1500.00.  I feel like I got a deal.  I have a 40\" Samsung LCD I bought this spring for 1100.00 and it also picks up the digital feed.  Its a 720p and I am impressed with its picture as well.  To me Samsung is setting the standard for affordable HDTV's.I would say if you have reservations about buying a product such as this from the internet don't hesitate.  The delivery company estimated the delivery date and beat it by two days.  My only complaint is that I didnt order the wall mounting hardware sooner.  The TV arrived on Thursday and my mount arrived on Friday.  Another issue I had was my wife needed the room painted and rearranged before I mounted it. A small price to pay for getting the TV.  Bottomline is extremely happy with this purchase and ease of purchase.  I cant wait to get the PS3 to watch Blu ray.", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "You Won't Be Disappointed!", "Author": "Harry Balls \"hoosier daddy\"", "ReviewID": "R3SKSDO6BGAQBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a great deal of time over the past year and a half agonizing over which tv to purchase.  I was dead set on LCD the 46\" from Samsung until about two weeks ago when I found the avsforum and started reading the threads.  I had already known about the 50A550 and liked the clean black bezel better than the TOC of the 650 LCD.I picked this up on Saturday night for $1469 no tax and free shipping.  On Tuesday I called my local EGL and confirmed that I was on the list for delivery and James told me it would be between 1500-1800 today.  I couldn't believe it because the estimated delivery date was 7 October.When the truck pulled up I was relieved that my plasma was backed up to the driver's seat and secured.  I've read all kinds of horrible reviews about loose boxes and smashed cartons.  I helped the delivery guy Tony transport the box down to the basement.  We took it out of the box and Tony stayed around to help me put it on the plasma mount.  To anyone wanting to know I purchased a Bello FP-8501HG plasma mounting stand. It took a call to Bello to figure out the correct schematic to use and thanks to the nice lady from Customer Service she figured it out.  This is not a review of the stand but I have to say that I've gotten quite a few compliments already for the way the system looks together.  I bought it at Bricklewood.com.Anyway, the plasma is the best investment in electronics I've ever made.  I don't have HD yet, that comes on Thursday.  I'm not an audiophile just a regular Joe and not hard to please.  Having said that, this set looks good to me on my Dish Network.  I did take it off Dynamic mode and put it in Movie mode and turned the contrast/brightness down to around 50 or so from what I've read on reviews that's what is recommended for the first 100 or so hours.  My build date is September '08.  I have no pink/green banding issues when set to all white screen.  No dead or stuck pixels.  Overall, I recommend this great set.  The reason(s) I purchased this set particularly was the clean all black bezel which matches my other components and stand.  It has 3 HDMI but I'm already thinking about buying an HDMI switcher.  I also purchased the Belkin Pure AV PF-30 surge protector.  This is a great set you won't be disappointed.  The set looks bigger sitting in my basement but sitting 12 feet away it has an amazing picture.  I just finished watching Saving Private Ryan and can't wait to buy the OPPO 981.  For those, like me, who always think about waiting until the next sets come out do yourself a favor and get yourself this set.I've read reviews stating that this set doesn't have backlit buttons on the remote.  I can personally say that this DOES have a button on the remote for backlit operation.  It's location is at the furthermost top right button.  It even has a light bulb on it.  It's not automatic but the function is there if warranted.", "Date": "September 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Even my girlfriend loves it", "Author": "Bob \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R168ODY9GQ11GM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I apologize for the long review.  This was my first time delving into the HD market.  I have been saving for a TV, receiver, stand and speakers for a while now.  My budget wasn't massive so I needed to find a mid/high-quality TV at a reasonable price.  I am a PC tech, but knew nothing of audio/video eq.  I still don't know much.  It is easy to become lost and frustrated while shopping for this type of thing.I researched TV's for nearly a year.  I narrowed my preference down to three plasma vendors.  The same three that almost everyone else does.  Pioneer, Panasonic and Samsung.Yes, the Kuro's and Panny's have blacker blacks.  However, the Kuro's are a bit pricey and the the Samsung's tend to handle color better than the Panny's.  I was almost settled on the Samsung FP-T5084.  It had great reviews and really everything I was looking for.  I saw several in different stores I visited and really liked it.  I was just about to buy one, when the PN50A550 was released.  After waiting for CNET review, visiting it in stores and waiting for customer feedback, I finally bought one in early June.  This, of course, was much to the dismay of my girlfriend who wants me to spend all of my money on a ring instead of an entertainment system.My first thought was much like everyone who replaces a 10 year-old 27\" tube tv with a 50\" HD plasma: \"Why the heck did I wait so long?!\"  I didn't have a PS3 yet, so I was watching HD television.  As a huge fan of certain Discovery, Nat.Geo and Animal Planet shows, I was utterly blown away.  You can see every scale on a crocodile and every hair on a lion.  What I love most, however, are sports.  I can't believe how crystal clear it is when I watch my beloved Red Sox, win or lose, play a game.  The players literally pop out of the screen.As for calibration:  I tried settings from avsforum.  There are several useful pieces of info on that site and I recommend it for anyone who is looking for information on any piece of audio/video equipment.  I have been using it a lot lately.  You don't even have to ask a lot of questions.  They do a great job of creating FAQ threads for popular electronic devices.  Anyway, the settings were good, but I actually prefer the settings on CNET.  They suit my small, somewhat dark living room better.  In the end, I wouldn't bother spending a lot to have your TV professionally calibrated.  A lot depends on the lighting in your room.  If you're that anal about it (aka - a \"videophile\"), though, go ahead and spend the money.  You probably won't be disappointed and you will squeeze that extra iota of perfection out of your TV.I guess it's obvious by now that I really like this TV.  Even my girlfriend likes it now.  She watches her \"John and Kate Plus 8\" and other girly shows and they take on a new life because of how they come through on this TV.The TV has ample inputs (3xHDMI 1.3) with the latest, greatest digital technology.  It has component, analog and usb ports.  It looks fantastic, mounted or otherwise.  Obviously the speakers are not very good.  The sound doesn't match the TV.  Looking at the picture, you expect a booming, epic soundtrack to go along with it.  Let's be honest, this TV deserves something more than just puny TV speakers.  If Samsung were to include awesome speakers on this TV, it would probably be bulkier and more expensive.  It would need a bigger internal amp to drive it.  Thus, it is truly imperative to purchase a decent receiver and speaker system to go with this TV.  I watched it without external speakers for two months.  The fact of the matter is, the speakers and receiver I purchased truly complete the TV.  I would rather watch a Blu-ray movie on my TV than go to a theater (if only because I can pause the movie and control the volume).  I have Troy (Director's cut), Alexander (Revisited), Fifth Element (Remastered), Ratatouille, 300, 3:10 to Yuma, Batman Begins and I've borrowed a few others.  I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but I felt as if I was watching them all for the first time.Just as an fyi, I now have a PS3, Denon AVR1909 receiver and Harman Kardon 5.1 speakers.  My apartment literally shakes.A word of warning:  Some people have recently reported pink or green banding on this plasma.  I didn't have this problem.  It seems to be limited to builds after August and is somewhat uncommon.  Just remember that you can return it for a new screen if you run into the issue.I won't comment on the delivery or Amazon in this thread because it's not about them.  It's about an incredible tv.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Well, not to one of my friends.  He thinks it's too big.  I sit 10 feet from the TV and it's perfect for me.  He sits 12 feet from his 42\" LG LCD tv and thinks it's still big.  I guess it's all about personal preference.  So go to the store, check it out and see if you like it.  Then order it on Amazon.Update 2/2/2011 - Just wanted to update.  Bought this in June 2008 and it has never had an issue.  I keep it clean.  I plug it and everything with any sort of connection to it into a UPS so it's always receiving conditioned, consistent electricity.  It is a power hog, but I like the picture on a Plasma better than any other type of TV.Update 11/12/2013 - For about a year now, my TV has been cycling on and off several times until the PCB board warms up enough and then it works well until the next time I have to turn it back on.  I came to this conclusion after much research.  I just purchased the following item:  BN94-01658B.  After installing it I have had no problems.  The TV is like new.  I'm not happy that this happened and that it is a very common issue with this model, but at least I don't need to buy a new TV.", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV and great doing business with Amazon", "Author": "Kevin M.

This was my first high-definition television, so I put lots of time and energy into reviewing many different models.  Upon reading lots of these consumer product reviews, as well as many professional reviews I got it narrowed down between this particular plasma model and the Samsung LN52A550 LCD model.  After going to a chain store and seeing each model side by side, I chose the plasma.  I was still a little nervous - until the TV arrived and the Comcast HD was installed!  The picture is absolutely stunning!  The colors are so true and bright.  One of my biggest concerns was burn-in with the plasma.  After reading consumer reports, I found out that the Samsung actually has the most burn-in preventative features of any plasma tv made today.  I can honestly say that burn-in has been NOT been an issue - and we have DVR (which gets paused frequently).  Buying this plasma has been the best decision I could have made.  Plus, buying it on Amazon was a great experience.  I save about $300-$400 by purchasing through Amazon!  I will admit that the waiting game was difficult, but WELL worth it.  The TV arrived in about 8 or 9 days in 1 piece and with no problems whatsoever.  The delivery guys brought it in, set it up, and even took the trash with them!  I had read some bad reviews about the shipping through Amazon, but I did not have any of the problems that the others did.  The tracking is not the best, but if you just let them be, it will show up at your door - I can assure you!

I understand that CEVA is not required to do anything more than unpack it, but I asked if he could help me install it on the mount and he did. He spent probably 30 minutes helping me unpack, remove the TV stand, and mount the TV. Then he asked me to hook it up, turn it on and verify that the picture, sound, and remote all worked. I was completely satisfied. Also, the price has already dropped and Amazon issued me a credit so I can verify the price match guarantee works!Yeah, the TV is awesome, too. I upgraded from a standard def tube TV so maybe anything would look awesome to me, but I did plenty of research online and standing in front of the Wall 'O TVs at retailers before I made this purchase and I think the TV looks even better in my house than it did in the stores.My main concern/paranoia (other than buying it online) was image retention (IR) or burn-in but from everything I've read burn-in is something of the past and IR is temporary.

The down side about this unit is its refresh rate, at least I'm pretty sure that this is what's responsible for this 1, and only negative.  While watching fast motion, the pixilation is rather disappointing.  When a rapid scene is displayed, the smooth, flawless picture is transformed into these large square blocks of distorted pixilation - regardless of an HD or SD signal.  Although this is a minor inconvenience, in every other way the set is amazing.  The menu system allows you to tweak the displays in ways that I have not seen other sets do.  Also, just an FYI - I was having issues with random bursts of brightness which a firmware upgrade totally addresses.  Those random bursts of brightness no longer exist.  On one last note, I have yet to see anything displayed in 1080p so I do not know what the picture is like but I can only conclude that it would be AMAZING.

The first, a 40\" LCD, has been extremely reliable over the last 3 years.  It has been moved to the bedroom and replaced with this 50\".  I narrowed it down to the 760, 650, and 550; and then did more research before making the final decision.  Personally, I think this set is an even comp to the other 2 short of an extra HDMI input, or colored bezel.  The picture quality is amazing.  I use my Sony Surround Sound for all audio because the sound is much better that way.I was going to go with an LCD again, but you get more bang for the buck with the plasma, and the picture is better.  I don't have any problems with reflections that the new LCDs wouldn't have, and the screen is plenty bright in the well-lit living area I have it in.I also want to note that both this TV, and the 40\" I purchased in 2006 were delivered on time as promised, and the guys that brought them out were very professional and thorough.Overall, this TV is great.

I moved from a 27 inch Sharp CRT to this TV. I am glad I made the right decision. I mainly watch over the air HD channels (Fox, PBS, ABC, NBC and CBS) using rabbit ears antenna since I don't have HD cable. The HD picture quality is outstanding even with the standard picture settings. In fact I was surprised that the SD content also displays quite well except for the black bands on the side. I recently settled on the \"Game\" mode for the HD and SD picture.External Picture Sources:I have a 1080p upconverting DVD player. I have connected using an HDMI cable and the picture is quite good though it is not full HD. I haven't tried to hook up a bluray payer. But as per other reviewers, the bluray picture quality is the best on this TV. I am waiting for the prices to drop on the bluray so that I can further enhance my TV watching experience.Audio:As many have reported, the audio is not exceptional as the picture. Hence I have turned OFF the audio on the TV and have connected the TV and my DVD player to my Yamaha AV receiver using the optical (TV) and coaxial(DVD) out. The Dolby digital audio quality from the TV is great when heard from home theater system. So I would suggest to hook up the audio to a home theater system.TV Menu:The TV settings menu is very well organized and hence are easy to understand with few sub-menus for quick changes.TV Remote:The remote is easy to handle and especially like the info button which gives picture resolution(1080i or 720p) for over-the-air channels which helps me to gauge even the slight changes in the picture quality.Things that could have been better:Shipping and Handling: Though the shipping was prompt with decent tracking, only one guy came to deliver and set up in a room of choice. There was supposed to be 2 guys as per the shipping label. Since my room of choice was upstairs, I ended up helping to lift the box and then the TV to set it up on the stand. So for somebody who is planning to buy the TV insist or make sure 2 guys to deliver the TV at your home.TV Price: After I bought the TV, the price dropped $150 in just a week which was quite annoying to see. Amazon does not price match after the purchase has been made. Hope they set a time limit (15 days) in the future.Hence I am giving 4 stars.Conclusion:TV is a good buy for an enhanced home TV experience. No major drawbacks. As many have said, you will never be disappointed.Suggestion:The current price is an excellent price.

I decided it was time to look.  Like many others I gravitated to this tv because of the review in Consumer Reports.

This one blew everything else away.I couldn't be happier with the purchase.  What stands out is the textures of the black hues and the depth of colors.  It was an easy tv to set up and immediately it felt like I got a new gaming system.  When friends came over they thought I spent $3-5k on it.  It's a very good tv and watching sports on it makes the games much better.  I'm spoiled now.I think this set works best if you get a good tv stand or wall mount - it's worth the money to buy something solid.  I got one with a swivel and the glare (which I'd get on any tv) is minimized by rotating, if needed, whenever I use it during the day.  And yeah, I think the sound system it comes with is barely adequate if you need to worry about disturbing the neighbors but if you want the complete theater feeling then getting speakers you like is worth it.  Put it this way, you save money on a great tv and Samsung doesn't force you to have a speaker system that might not work for you.All in all this is one of the best electronic purchases I've made and after 3+ months it's just as good as the day I set it up.", "Date": "February 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Movies and Sports at Their Best", "Author": "James L.

Luckily, he had already picked out this model so I simply had to shop for the best price. His cheapest was at Crutchfield and so naturally that's where I went first to research. However, I happened to check Amazon, and to my pleasant surprise I found this exact model new with the Amazon guarantee for $1350 with free shipping, about $400 less than my husband had originally told me it was. So, I went through the reviews on the shipping and all that, and I decided to take the plunge. I ordered the television and found it would be shipped through Pilot. This turned out to be a very good company to ship through. The online estimate of the arrival date was almost exact, and when I called the local Pilot location, I asked if I could delay by one more day so my husband could be surprised by a plamsa TV delivery to his doorstep. The delivery man even went so far as to tell my husband \"Happy Birthday\" for me as I was at work.As far as the television itself: Superb quality and performance. Even though we don't yet have a home theater system (which I'm sure he'll want next), this still puts out decent sound. There are options for changing the sound to make it most optimal for the room and program. The color is very nice and with our newer Panasonic BluRay disc player and HDMI cable, we can't be happier. It even plays non-HD DVDs very well (we like Ratatouille). We were also pleased to find so many different settings to adjust color, brightness, and make it most pleasurable based on the light in the room and the type of movie.My only beef *still more glare than I though there would be* While it's still probably one of the better, and I understand to some extent you just cannot completely eliminate glare, I guess I wasn't necessarily expecting to still see our faces glaring back at us in a bright room, even after making setting adjustments.Summary: if you can get this product for this price on Amazon and have it shipped through Pilot, you will be very pleased.

I already knew what to expect picture-wise with this TV because the Round Table Pizza that I frequent on Saturdays has three PN58A550 58-Inchers on their walls... this of course is what sold me on the set.  That, and everyone sitting around me saying \"what model is that, the picture is so clear!\"  What really blew me away though is that I didn't have to mess with the color settings, and to my surprise, the manufacture date on the back of this set reads December 08!  Can you say wow?  Anyhow, it didn't have the latest 1005.3 firmware, so I downloaded and installed it via USB before messing with brightness and contrast.  All in all, this is a pretty amazing TV for the price, and the color and SD processor is what really make it stand out from the rest!  Before this TV, I had purchased one of those $999 Sharp Aquos 46\" LCD sets from Costco just before Christmas.  Although the price was right, the colors seemed off and I could never get them right, the SD picture sucked, and it seemed like I could see tiny artifacts when objects moved quickly across the screen.  I can honestly say that this is no longer the case with this plasma.  All is smooth, grass is green, colors more vibrant and warm, and HD life is grand!  Like everyone else, I had my worries about making such a large purchase online, and my condolences to the last reviewer.  I hope Samsung and Amazon do the right thing and replace your set in a timely fashion so that you can get back to enjoying it.  One last thing, Amazon used to let you call within a month of a sale to get a price difference if the price you paid went down.  You were able to do this every time the price dropped within that month.  I just found out that as of September 08 this is no longer the case.

Very deep blacks...and you can see on all angles which is important for side viewing.- SD picture is very good as well...you just have to blow up the picture as to avoid the black side bars (which can result in burn in over time).Regarding burn in...this is what scared me about plasma TV's. I decided to make the leap. I have only experienced one problem (as I have been very careful to prevent burn in at any cost). I was playing Madden 2009 on the PS3 for a few games...and once I turned it off, I noticed the image of the score that is kept at the top of the screen...it was etched in the black background.

The only better picture IMHO, after months of looking and hours of staring at different sets, are the newer pioneer kuros, but those are about double the price of this samsung 5-series or more.  Comparable panasonics may have better black levels, and consequently \"pop\" more, with better shape definition and more detail in shadows/dark areas, but the colors are a bit off, especially greens, and they have a lot of video noise, especially in darker scenes.  Plus, the sammy's cheaper than them as well.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a 50\" TV, period.  Much better picture--deeper colors, etc., than an LCD.  And for all the complaints about the Filterbrite screen, i have it mounted in a pretty well-lit room w/ windows all around, and as long as you don't have a window/light source shining directly on it (which is easy enough to control!) it looks bright and sharp even in the middle of the day with no glare or reflections.EDIT: I should also add that I was torn for a while between getting 1080p and saving $500 going with the 450 model at 720p.  I am very glad I spent the extra dough.  Don't judge the difference in the pictures at bestbuy/circuit city/etc.--they only feed it a 720p signal so you're not going to notice a difference.  I thought the picture was better on the 550 anyway because it has a slightly better contrast ratio and truer colors, but not worth enough to spend $500 extra.  That all changes, however, when you pop a blu-ray disc in.  The difference is absolutely noticeable and after watching several movies on blu-ray, regular old 720p hi-def doesn't look quite as stunning anymore.  Since eventually every movie is going to come out on blu-ray--and since this day is not too far in the future--it absolutely makes sense to opt for the better resolution.  (note: i sit between 8-10 ft away from this 50\" tv.  if you're 12 or more feet away then the difference is probably less noticeable).The only reason it gets four stars is because of the delivery.  Order through amazon if possible!  Unfortunately, the prices on amazon fluctuate almost daily, and the day i bought it their price had jumped up $100.  So I bought from electronics expo, which amounted to the previous amazon price once shipping was factored in.  I have no problems w/ electronics expo other than that they choose third-rate shipping companies to ship their stuff, like Manna Distribution Systems.  I was at work so my mother came over to accept it, and said that the deliveryman was rude, refused to take it into the house until after much arguing (even though the order specifically said he was to take it past the threshold into the house), and made my mother sign a paper saying it was in good condition before he would bring it inside.  The tv was unharmed and worked fine, but there's no excuse for such ridiculous service.Anyway, order directly from amazon and you will absolutely love this tv.", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung PN50A550", "Author": "Ronald DAniello", "ReviewID": "R2UOVPCQOE8LAM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this set in July 2008 and already have a problem with this set.

So yes I would consider myself a Samsung Fanboy. So I bought this model twice for a reason I will explain later in the review.My first one spontaneously cracked on me and Samsung at the time refused to replace it. Keep in mind I had the unit for 42 days! I SWEAR I did not touch the plasma for this to happen. One second I'm watching WWE RAW in HD the next minute \"Pop\" & \"buzz\" noise. Lo and behold the screen cracked  on the inside.So I bought another one with the hope I could get the first one replaced (which Samsung finally is \"in process\" of exchanging as I write this - this is only after dozens of emails, countless calls, and escalation to Executive Customer Relations (ECR) over a 2 month period.But I digress:Positives:Picture quality -provides an excellent device for movies and other hi-def content. No artifacts at all even in fast action (well duh its a plasma) unlike many LCD's where artifacts (little boxes that are unclear) are somewhat common.Color accuracy -The most accurate color reproduction. EVen if it was not professionally calibrated the accuracy in color is great. Yes thats using factory settings.Aesthetics -The piano black feature is aesthetically pleasing and prvides a clean sleek look for any room.Negatives:Sound - The downward firing \"hidden speaker\" within the bezel is not good. It shakes the unit when the volume is above 40 as well as when there is bass in the signal.\"Anti-Glare\" filter -I put anti-glare in quotes because anyone who has seen this unit in person will attest to the high gloss finish of the screen. I could shave in front of the tv when off. Keep that in mind if you are considering this tv in a room with light. This unit should be used in low-light rooms such as basements or rooms that have windows which get little light.Black levels -Compared to Panasonic and Pioneer the blacks are not as deep. But considering the image quality of Panasonic and Pioneer's steep price there is a reason Samsung is usually the best bang for the buck.Quality -Like I stated earlier the first unit made it 42 days before cracking on me SPONTANEOUSLY.Customer Service -It took me 2 months to get Samsung to accept responsibility. They denied me several times over and had to get my call escalated to ECR. They certainly do not stand by their product as I would have hoped.Image retention - Common in most plasmas. When you turn the unit off you will see the image for about 30 seconds after. It does go away... eventually.Bottom line beatiful unit beautiful picture - poor reliability and service mounts to a 2 star review. Of course I also had way too many more negatives to outweigh the positives.I have since returned my second unit and replaced it with the 52LG70 (see my review there) which is excellent.

Betz", "ReviewID": "R3BIMHCG6PG1IX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Skip down to where it says \"THE BAD\" if all you're after is the reason it only gets 2 stars and you should save your money...I purchased the Samsung PN50A550 to replace a 42\" Philips Plasma that became diseased with video problems after only 2-1/2 short years.  In only 2 more months, they should have the parts to fix the Philips.  Ain't big expensive TVs fun?I ordered the Samsung July 1, it shipped July 2, I received it today, July 9.  Not too bad a turnaround.  The CEVA guys didn't do anything but open the box, and from some of the other reviews I was hoping they'd at least plug it in and turn it on, if not help me heft it onto the wall bracket.  Oh well.Regarding the actual unit...The good:  It's a competently functioning unit overall, the picture looks good, the sound is better than the Philips and for that matter there's a whole lot that's better than the Philips, like the program guide, the menus, the tweaking options...  But then there's the bad:THE BAD:  The entire reason I spent $550 more for this set instead of the PN50A450 is that the latter lacks a PIP (picture in picture) feature.  The PN50A550 does have PIP, but it is UTTERLY USELESS.  Why, you ask?First and foremost, you can ONLY use the PIP to view ANALOG TV channels in the sub-window, which makes it mostly useless immediately, and completely useless in Feb 2009.  Digital over-the-air channels (and presumably digital cable channels) are NOT AVAILABLE AT ALL using PIP, in EITHER window.Second, you can only use the PIP if you are watching an external source plugged into the component video (3-cable RCA plugs - Y/Pb/Pr) or HDMI inputs.  If you are watching any normal TV, you cannot turn on PIP and watch your DVD, VCR, Cable, Satellite, or other source in the sub-window.  Nor can you turn it on to even watch analog channels if you are watching any component that is connected via S-video or composite video (one RCA plug).So much for the entire reason I wanted PIP, which was to watch my satellite box in one window and digital over-the-air channels in another.  The satellite box only has composite or S-video outputs, so I can't even watch cruddy analog channels for the few months they'll still be around.Third, even assuming the PIP otherwise worked flawlessly and functioned the way *everybody* *else's* PIP worked regarding what you can and cannot watch, you cannot switch between the windows.  Further, in order to get the sound from the second window, you have to wade through several menus.  So there is no way to, for example, be watching football in lovely high-def on your local digital channel and have something on the satellite or cable in the other window, swapping back and forth during commercials or what have you.  Or to monitor two different external inputs at once.Fourth, there is no PIP button on the remote.  You can choose to wade through a half-dozen menus to turn it on and off, or use the helpful \"Tools\" button and scroll through several items to turn it on and off.In short, the PIP function is USELESS.  This wouldn't be so bad, if it wasn't SO VERY EASY for the manufacturer to make it NOT be useless.  If it was hard to make PIP function well, then nobody else's PIP would work worth a darn either.  Samsung must have had a contest among their engineers to see who could screw up a basic feature the most.Other gripes are of the rather commonplace variety.  It has no video out function (the sole saving grace of the Philips) that would allow me to continue to pipe the video and audio to other TVs in the house.  I didn't expect it to have one, however.  The remote is NOT a universal remote, so if you were hoping to control anything else with it, forget it.  That's probably a plus actually, since I've never had a \"universal\" remote that even came close to controlling the DVD player and satellite box.  This way I don't get my hopes up.As far as I can recall, the PIP and the screen resolution are the only real differences between this TV and the 450, which as I've mentioned a time or two is over FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS cheaper.  Shop for yourself:Samsung PN50A450 50-Inch 720p Plasma HDTVMy Philips is 720p, the 450 is 720p, the 550 is 1080p (Oooooh!)  I see NO difference in picture quality between 720p and 1080p, and neither will you unless you happen to exclusively watch Blu-Ray disks.  Nobody's broadcasting in 1080p as far as I can recall, and odds are pretty good that by the time they start doing so in earnest, you'll be looking for a replacement for this unit anyway and moving it to the bedroom so you can fall asleep while not really looking at it.To sum up, this would be a four-star TV (so far, after a whopping 4 hours of use) if only they hadn't put in a PIP system that is worthlessand charged me 550 bucks extra for the privilege.If you don't care about PIP and will never care about PIP but for whatever reason simply must have a 1080p model, knock yourself out and buy this TV.  If you do care about PIP, avoid this whole line of TVs.  Otherwise, I'm sure the 450 will do you just fine, and think of all the toys / beer / shoes you can buy having saved 500 bucks.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "looking for a real good tv please dont pick this one. before the tv shut down the picture isnt real good compared to lcd", "Author": "Hugh Smith \"Trust me Always\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y3I1T3DAHHOF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have received a broken Samsung PN50A550 50-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV .

But alas, I can't because it hasn't ever arrived.Imagine, my supprise when the Amazon tracker documented it had been delivered yesterday 11/13/08and signed by someone I had never heard of.1st call to Amazon: \"How are you enjoying your TV as we see if was delivered yesterday\" Next they had no telephone # for Pilot the deliver company as they just stated using them last week. Twenty minutes later Amazone provides # for Pilot. Amazon offers to ship a new unit or refund my money. ADv no not yet let's try to find out what happened to the TV.1st call to Pilot who confirms delivery of the TV in Fargo yesterday.  I advised Pilot I don't have the TV. Agent adv she will check. She call back an hour later and adv the post on the tracker was an error by Pilot and the tv is still in Eagan MN where it arrived 11/10. Pilot adv they didn't have a telephone # for me so couldn't call to arrange delivery. Asked if they had contact Amazon for the #. Pilot adv no they do have access to Amazon and they only got my number when I called them this morning. Pilot adv the can deliver it next week. Adv not acceptable as they should ben able to get tele # and why would I would service from a natiowide shipper that has an agent in California comfirming he delibered a TV in North Dakota.2nd call to Amazon to request case update and have to repeat the entire story and agent adv it will be delivered today even thought it's 250 miles away in Minn.with a company that tells me that they can't delivery it till next week.1st call from Pilot who adv they might be able to deliver it on Monday but it will be shipped in a unheated truck and they will drop it off. Adv of Amazon While Glove Delivery program. Pilot asked I want the delivery crew to just sit around till the TV warms up for an hour before we can turn it on. Adv yes I do. Pilot adv will call back later.2nd call from Pilot who adv it will be delivered today in a heated truck between 2 PM and 6 PM. Adv I will accept those conditions.

I hope to write on that once I get it. When I made the purchase 11 days ago (June 16th), the promised delivery time was 3-5 days. I made the purchase hoping to get delivery by Friday with the plan to start watching the important games of Euro cup and start early on Wimbledon. First Thursday, then Friday, and finally Saturday came and went and there was no sign of my TV on this website's tracking system.This was all I was seeing twice a day:Date Time Location Event DetailsJune 19, 2008 06:04:15 AM San Francisco CA US Arrival ScanJune 17, 2008 04:00:00 PM Reno NV US Shipment received by carrierThe Euro was gone and I was on track to lose the first round of Wimbledon too. I get an email on the 25th to contact CEVA for delivery from some [...] address, and it lands in my Junk folder as expected. I see it by the end of the day and call the number at a bit past 6 PM and it goes strainght to a voicemail. Work requires me to be in important meetings sometimes pretty much from 9 to 5, so I don't leave a voice mail. I called the next evening a bit before 6 PM to catch someone on the phone for to schedule delivery for Saturday. The biggest shocker came when the guy picks up and tells me \"the truck comes to your town only from Monday to Friday between 10 AM and 6 PM\". Worse still \"you be home eaither from 10 to 2 or 2 to 6 to receive the delivery. We can not call you 15 minutes before as we do not provide our drivers with cell phones\". How convenient? I live in the middle of Silicon Valley in CA, and that's the worst delivery schedule I've ever heard of (apart from the cable and electricity guys of course). By now I was almost losing myself as there is no way I can skip work for half a day to get my television. I would never go to a local store to buy a television for half a day on a weekday. But do I really have a choice now? Probably not! I tell him I will call back when I arrange a backup for myself at work. I call him in 30 minutes but it's past 6 and I leave a voicemail to have my TV delivered on 27th between 10 and 2 (that's today BTW). WHen I call them again in the morning around 8:30 AM they said TOO LATE! The trucks have left for the day, call us one day in advance! Voicemails don't count!! IF YOU BOOK NOW WE CAN DELIVER BETWEEN MONDAY AND FRIDAY NEXT WEEK! PERFECT!! Another weekend up in the smoke.Now I'm walking around wearning a big L on my face for spending almost two grands on AMAZON. What amazes me more is not the lack of service from a bunch of CEVA guys in my town. I wonder if AMAZON ever realizes that their biggest weekness against the local stores is the amount of time it takes people to get the stuff they buy. If they do, why would they pick such a loser delivery company? Is this the only way they could afford to deliver cheap enough to compete? If yes then I will be very scared the next time I make a purchase here.Maybe some of you wonder why wouldn't I go pick the damn thing from the CEVA place. If I pick it up myself and it is damaged or it doesn't work, I'm on my own. I'm worried looking at their service standards that i will have bigger problems to deal with in that case.I hope to add more in the next few days!
