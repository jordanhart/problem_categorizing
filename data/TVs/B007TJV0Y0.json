The 2d performance for movies is amazing... The input lag (66ms) is a bit high for gaming but has not provided any problems. The 3d is pretty terrible with a muddled picture and lots of cross talk. For everything I use it for this TV is amazing. Picture quality is bright and clear, colors are accurate and not over done. Would HIGHLY recommend this TV for 2d use.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,762.46", "Features": "Built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae for Wireless Internet TV and more1\nBrilliant Full HD (1080p) picture quality for 2D & 3D\nLED backlit for incredible contrast & slim design\nX-RealityTM Engine for a clear, vivid, life-like picture\nSmooth motion clarity with MotionFlowTM XR 240", "Name": "Sony - KDL55EX723 55\" 3D Internet LED", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31zMp8r4v0L.jpg", "ProductID": "B007TJV0Y0"}}
