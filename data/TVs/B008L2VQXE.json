Holman", "ReviewID": "R3HCJ8AN2K0KS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's true what the other reviewers are saying: this set's viewing angle means that if you aren't able to watch it straight on, the picture starts looking washed out, getting worse as you move further to the side. Its sound is also nothing to brag about, though I wouldn't call it annoying or unacceptable. But despite all that, it's a good choice in many situations.It's a logical choice for a kitchen, where a 21 or even a 19 inch set might take up too much counter or wall space. If you're spending your time chopping vegetables or in other cooking-related activities, you may not care about the best picture from every angle. It could really make sense in just about any setting where space is tight and watching TV is not the main focus (or where viewing angle won't be an issue).It could also be a useful addition to many a home theater. I have a theater room with a Mitsubishi projector and a motorized 120 inch screen. But sometimes, I don't feel like powering it all up, and waiting awhile, to see if there's something I want to watch on TCM tonight, or on Netflix or Amazon Prime, or if I should go look for a blu-ray, etc. I've thought for a while that it would be nice to see what my options are on a small TV connected to the same system. The 16 inch Viewsonic would be perfect for that purpose, especially since my counter is already crowded with remote controls and a popcorn machine (though I'd need to replace my AV receiver with one that has 2 HDMI outs, or get a box that accomplishes the same purpose).But I actually bought the Viewsonic for another purpose.I shoot video in my home video/recording studio. When I'm also the subject of the video, staring at a camera or camcorder's built in 3 or 4 inch LCD from 10 to 15 feet across the room is challenging at best. You can buy a 9 inch monitor to mount on a tripod next to your camcorder -- there are monitors designed for this purpose, but they cost $600 to $800 or more. This 16 inch Viewsonic has proved a good alternative. It's wonderfully light, yet well built, and fits nicely on a stand right next to my camcorder -- big enough, but not too big. I don't rely on it for color, exposure, etc., since those factors can shift with viewing angle. But it's great for composing a still or video image. As a bonus, it can alternatively be connected to a computer and used, with appropriate software, as a make-shift teleprompter.If you have room for a TV that's a bit larger, are concerned about the viewing angle, and don't mind paying a few extra dollars, Samsung has a 19 inch TV (its smallest set) that you may like more -- I own that one as well, and the Samsung's picture is better. Still, I'm pleased with the Viewsonic. If there was another 14 - 16 inch monitor out there that offered a better picture from a wider viewing angle, at a reasonable price, I'd buy it. But I don't think it exists.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV/Monitor", "Author": "Jerry Milbauer", "ReviewID": "R1K2YQLYCUA38J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good TV for the money.

Previous reviews state the sound is tinny which it is but the TV is small for crying out loud. It's really not that bad. It sounds great with a set of external speakers plugged into the mini audio out jack. It doesn't have the greatest picture compared to say a Samsung but the price was good. Wouldn't want to use it as a bedroom TV etc. as the size would be too small.
