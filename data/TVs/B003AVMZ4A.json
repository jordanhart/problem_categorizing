I use it primarily for a monitor for my laptop.  I connect via HDMI and the picture is awesome the sound is excellent and when I watch TV with it a very clean bright picture.  Amazon price matched this so for $149 it was a steal a good deal at $225.  I was cautious because I don't know anything about Magnavox but if it holds I'm a happy camper.Remote is good Too!", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "This thing is my best friend that plugs in.", "Author": "Will2Combat", "ReviewID": "R23RO3OFWWZ5HA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For years I toted this TV around.From job to job, in and out of college, home to home, and state to state. It hasn't broken, it hasn't malfunctioned, it's light enough to be backpack friendly and high enough resolution to sit two friends side-by-side for a Soul Calibur marathon without issue.This is an excellent buy for the price and for a student or whoever who needs a versatile, comfortable high-def monitor. I use it for my PC and for my PS3 and while the sound is merely ok a good set of headphones fixes that.For the people who'd use it the most it's damn hard to beat in value. I bought this is September of 2011, and it hasn't let me down yet.And when it inevitably wears out it'll be cheap to replace.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Supports 1080i,720P,480i,480p\nSide PC Input,2 HDMI inputs\n1366 x 768 WXGA res\nSleep Timer, auto shut off\n5 band EQ and ECO", "Name": "Magnavox 19MF330B/F7 19-Inch 720p LCD HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JZKXK0WpL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003AVMZ4A"}}
