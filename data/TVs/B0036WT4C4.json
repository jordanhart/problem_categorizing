I'll only pick up the Samsung remote on occasion to adjust advanced settings, but when I do, I often push an unintended button.*Very slight edge-lit brightness on black borders. Much of what's on TV will fill the screen, so you won't even have the opportunity to notice the effect. Really, it's not that bad--I've seen far worse light leakage while watching movies on my 2007 alum iMac.The Tolerated:*There's only one thing that bugs me a bit, and it's not a deal breaker. (Besides, I already bought the TV, so the deal has been, well. . . concluded, if you must.) When the screen is mostly black and only a small graphic is displayed somewhere, the LEDs go a bit dim--you can actually see, over a fraction of a second, the light levels drop. I'm assuming that the TV was set up this way so that the LEDs wouldn't be leaking ghostly light on a largely black screen. I've fussed with the settings, but I can't make this effect go away. I haven't yet fully explored all the setting menus, so I just might hit pay dirt soon, or maybe Samsung will nix that effect with a firmware update. At any rate, whatever text is dimmed is still very legible, and when the next screen-filling scene pops up, the LEDs power up without any detectable delay so that thereafter the screen's as bright as it should be. No biggie--it's not enough of a problem for me to scratch a star off the rating.The Tweakable:*Turning off motion smoothing is not difficult under most circumstances; indeed, some content begs to be smooved, e.g., sports and competitive cooking shows. But when I first plugged in a movie via the USB drive, I got motion smooving by default and wanted none of it. Whenever I pushed the remote's \"Menu\" button, I ended on a screen far, far away from the USB drive's content, and ended up adjusting the picture settings for the cable feed and not the target movie on the USB drive. I was bedeviled awhile, but a bit of snooping around the owner's manual led to this minor discovery: by pressing the \"Tools\" button on the Samsung remote, I could enter a submenu that let me turn off the smooving effect without leaving the movie. Cheap soap opera video effect, begone!Conclusion:The picture is what matters most, and this TV's output makes my jaw drop to the floor. Which is rather fortuitous, because I need something down there to catch my eyeballs.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "I got two lemons", "Author": "C. Stephens", "ReviewID": "R3HRGYXWPACC7X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've purchased two of these TVs from Amazon.com, and I've had to return them both due to problems. Maybe I was just unlucky, but I will not be purchasing another Samsung TV. Thankfully, Amazon's service department was fantastic through the entire ordeal.For the first TV, within the first few hours of use I noticed that the left side of the screen was darker than the right side, and that it was also flickering occasionally. I called Samsung tech support, and I was very unhappy with their service. First, when they asked for the model # of the TV, they asked me to confirm it several times because this particular model was not in their system. I realize this is a new model, but not having any record whatsoever of my particular TV model was not confidence inspiring. After walking through a series of troubleshooting steps, they tried to prematurely pin the source of the problem on my cable box. Samsung support said the dark left side of the screen was caused by my cable box, and this was before we tried the \"test image\" under the \"diagnostic\" section of the TV menu, which also showed the problem, clearly demonstrating that the problem was in the TV itself and not related to anything connected to it. After they finally acknowledged that there was a problem in the TV they arranged for a local repair shop to contact me. They said it would be 24-48 hours before I was contacted. No thanks. This brand new TV was going back. I'm not waiting for days for service contact and further days or weeks for a 'repair' of a brand new $1400 TV.Amazon's service folks were great we worked it out so that a new TV would be delivered, and the old defective TV would be picked up, all in one go.The second TV also had a problem. The TV 'creaked' or 'popped' or 'clicked' about every 3-5 minutes when the TV was on, and would continue this for several hours after turned off. I'm not sure if it was the plastic body making noise due to heat, or something electronic inside the TV, but it was far too loud and happened far too often to be acceptable. At best, it was distracting when watching TV, and at worst it was indicative that something was wrong inside the TV (try googling: \"samsung TV clicking\").  I did confirm that this was definitely the TV, by removing and unplugging all other components, and noting that the behavior still did continue.So again, I contacted Amazon's service folks to arrange a return. This time I did not order a replacement. There was no charge to me on any of the shipping in either direction since the TV was considered defective.For the short while I had this TV, here are some of the things I noticed about it:1.The 120MHz Auto Motion Plus option defaults to \"standard\". This makes the picture look real, \"too real\" almost (I've seen people describe this as the \"soap opera effect\"). This might be OK for sports but I preferred this option to be off for normal movie / TV show watching. Try disabling this feature first if you think the picture looks \"strange\".2.The TV has an ambient light sensor which lowers the brightness of the picture automatically when the ambient light is low (e.g. in a living room with lights off). I found that the TV picture got way too dark when the lights were turned off in the room. After some investigation, I discovered that you can set the amount of dimming that occurs when this option kicks in. This is under the \"Eco Sensor\" option. It defaulted to maximum dimming, which made the picture totally unsuitable for viewing (shadows and darker parts of the image were completely blacked out). I adjusted this so that it did dim, just not as much, and then it was OK. So if you find that your TV is too dark when the room is dark, but OK when the room is well lit, then check this option.3.The TV appeared to be inconsistent in holding it's settings after losing power. For example, every time the power went out, or the TV was unplugged, I had to manually re-set the options I've described above (Auto Motion Plus and Eco Option dimming level). Oddly, sometimes, the TV would retain it's settings. Not sure if I got a lemon or what but this was very frustrating as it would take a few minutes to reset these things manually with the remote.[*** This was user-error, not a problem with the TV - see \"UPDATE (Jun 2 2010)\" at the bottom of this review ***]4.I was not particularly pleased with the quality of the stand. It looked nice, but for the two TVs I had I found that neither was level when sitting on the stand. The first one tilted to the left and the second one tilted to the right (just to be clear - both were on the exact same level surface, so I'm sure the problem was the TV stand itself). The TV stand is not adjustable, so there's no real way to deal with this.5.Otherwise, this is a good looking TV, it is ultra-thin, and very sleek. Unfortunately, for me, the quality was not up to par.UPDATE (May 1 2010): Against my better judgment I decided to give Samsung one more chance, because I definitely like the look of their TVs over the other brands. So I did purchase a third Samsung TV (again from Amazon.com), but I got the \"traditional\" LCD model that is not LED backlit (Samsung LN46C630) rather than this same LED model (Samsung UN46C6300). So far here is what I think about the traditional LCD model replacing the LED version that I initially purchased:- I've had no problem with the display, or with the TV clicking/creaking/popping.- I'd be hard pressed to see any noticeable degradation in picture quality in going from the LED backlit LCD, to the regular LCD model. The only think I can notice is that black screens are \"light\", as is common for traditional LCD screens. Unless you are a videophile this makes no practical difference when watching everyday TV, movies, etc. This is still a 1080p HDTV and let me assure you the image quality still looks fantastic.- The only real, noticeable disadvantage I can find to the traditional LCD vs the LED model is that it is thicker (the LED model was ultra-thin). Having said that, the thicker body of the traditional LCD model feels much sturdier and more solid than the LED model. The LED model creaked and popped when moving it around and this one does not. Obviously the thinner LED would look better on the way (with a low-profile mount), but this LCD version still looks nice.- I know the traditional LCD consumes more power than the LED, but given the significantly cheaper price I can live with that, and I doubt the difference is significant enough to make any real dent in the energy bill.- The menu system / firmware appears to be identical between the two models.- I had to adjust the Auto Motion Plus and Eco Sensor options for this TV just like I did for the LED model (see above).- This model, like my LED model, came with the \"Contrast\" setting maxed out to '100' by default. I needed to tone this down.- The stand is different, and mounts to the TV in a different way than the LED model. My new traditional LCD model is perfectly level, unlike the two LED models I had.- Oh yeah, the traditional LCD model is about $400-500 cheaper than the LED model.I'd strongly suggest that anyone looking at the Samsung UN46C6300 LED model strongly consider the less expensive Samsung LN46C630 traditional LCD model. For roughly $500 less, I've got a better built TV, and I can live without the ultra-slim frame.UPDATE (Jun 2 2010): I'd like to clarify that the #3 issue I reported above about the TV not holding it's settings after losing power is incorrect. I have just discovered that each source input (i.e. each HDMI input) has it's own unique settings. I was not aware of this originally. I think what originally happened is that  I set HDMI input #1 (Cable box) to put the contrast down to 50, and then was still seeing a contrast setting of 100, but on the HDMI input #2 (BD player). The only explanation I had for this was loss of power, and I think I was wrong. So, in summary, there was probably no problem with this particular aspect of the TV, and it's up to the user to town down the contrast / auto motion plus / etc features for *every* source input that they use. As mentioned above I now have the LN46C630 model with a similar menu/firmware system, and it holds its settings just fine through power-outages.

What did this all mean?Well, it explained why the TV picture quality of my TV was terrible and the picture quality in the local store was vastly better.The \"auto-motion\" was jerky on my tv and even had shadowing and images that would stay on the screen.For example, if someone was walking on TV that had black hair, the head would bouncing up and down while they were walking would stay at the top of the \"bounce\" while the were coming down.After further research on he type of panels, I found out that the panel I had, \"CN01\" was manufactured by Chi Mei Optoelectronics which is not samsung but a third party, hence the bad quality.This is a chart that may be useful for some people (thank you AVS forums!)  * A = AU Optronics (AUO) A-MVA  * B = Chi Lin Technology (CLT)  * C = Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO)  * I = LG Display IPS (LGD)  * P = Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CPT)  * S = Samsung S-PVA (S-LCD)  * H = Samsung S-PVA (3D)  * Q = IPS Alpha Technology LTD (Hitachi & Panasonic) IPS Alpha/IPS ProAMAZON was great in dealing with the return and refunded my money very quickly.

Picture quality is superb and brightness is more than adequate. LOVE the glossy look and thinner bezel than my LCD.Unfortunately, I've noticed that this set has uneven backlighting, almost looking like splotches where more light bleeds in  during predominantly black scenes. Apparently this is characteristic of lower-quality edge-lit LED TVs (I'm finding out the hard way). My 52\" Samsung LCD has perfectly-even back-lighting compared to this set.Fortunately, it is imperceptible at any other time except when the TV is trying to display black. So as long as I am viewing a TV program or movie that fills my entire screen, and the show is engaging enough, I don't notice it. Ultimately, this is why I ended up keeping it, rather than returning it, because my wife helped me realize that if the show isn't engaging enough for you to not notice the uneven back-lighting, you shouldn't be watching it.So much for deeper blacks though; I expected more from a Samsung, but I think the technology still needs to mature. My advice: There is no compelling reason to go with LED at this price range, unless you absolutely have to have a 1\" thick TV. You don't really get any deeper black levels, and in fact, you get the unpleasant artifact of uneven back-lighting. Stick with LCD unless you get the high-end models that may not exhibit this behavior.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Bang for the Buck", "Author": "OakParkBob", "ReviewID": "R2Q8FWSUE2TUUX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was the first large purchase I made from Amazon.

The delivery and set up was on time and completed in less than 15 minutes. I was pleased with this service.The standard picture setting was different than what I saw in the store, with movies having more of a video quality than film. Once adjusted the picture was excellent and when viewing Blu-Ray movies it looked beautiful.

First of all, the Amazon process could not have been better - the TV was shipped in flawless condition, the delivery company showed up within 20 minutes of the beginning of our selected window, and they put the TV on its stand and placed it for us.  No muss, no fuss.  Amazon's price gave us about $600 in savings compared with the local Best Buys and Belmont TV stores.  We were initially nervous about buying such an important (and large) item online, but kudos to Amazon on this one.Now, the TV itself - the picture quality is jaw-dropping unbelievable.  And the color, contrast, and brightness balances were spectacular right out of the box - we have yet to make a single adjustment to those settings, and yet we find that golf, football, TV dramas, and movies are all amazingly lifelike (perfect skin tones, natural colors, etc.).  It feels exactly like having a \"magic window\" that can produce any view as if it's really right there in front of you.  We watched \"Witness\" - a 1985 classic that takes place in Amish country - and the severe black wardrobe of the Amish made me feel satisfied that this TV can reproduce pleasing blacks that help the other colors displayed to \"pop\" appropriately.Speaking of black, I was initially worried after reading about light-leaking at the corners (common to virtually all side-lit LED models), and I'm relieved to see that it's not an issue for us.  It is detectable if you really hunt for it, but I watched \"Contact\" (where Jodi Foster zooms off through space in her little capsule) and did not even notice any light-leak in the stunning space vistas that movie offers.  Again, if I decided to watch only the extreme bottom-left or bottom-right corner of the screen for the entire film, I might have gone \"ooh - there it is!\" but come on, who does that?People may not think of what a TV looks like when it's not on, but TVs are important focal points (especially as they get to today's sizes), and this model is a beauty.  Rather than be boxy in shiny plastic, the edges are translucent glass which give the TV a very refined feel.  We saw other Samsung models that were more expensive and supposedly offer greater features, but their chrome spider-leg stands are hideous - this model, thankfully, offers a pleasingly simple and stable flat foot with a very useful cylindrical swivel that moves efficiently but stays firmly put when you have the TV at the proper angle.Finally, the Samsung menu design is surprisingly intuitive and benefits from extraordinarily helpful descriptions if each selection that display on the bottom of the TV as you scroll through the menu options.  The menus are organized in columns that build out from the left with very attractive icons; it overlays the image in a very tasteful way instead of displaying some ugly blue background or anything like that.  One issue that may cause you to work these menus immediately is that the TV defaults to using MotionPlus in an attempt to combat motion-blur and provide crisp movement.  Somewhat annoyingly, it defaults to MotionPlus separately for every connection you'll make to the TV (such as DVD player, Wii, etc.) - but at least you can turn it off.  Like other reviewers, we did not like the \"soap opera\" quality - and furthermore, once we turned it off, we were impressed that the LED technology handles HD motion extremely well.  We do not see any blur even in fast-moving sports scenes.  We had some standard-def content on our Tivo that did, in truth, look worse on this new TV than it used to on the CRT - but the MotionPlus feature gave us an unacceptable trade-off by turning the motion-blur into really artificial \"pan-and-scan\" or soap opera video-camera movements.  We simply accepted that standard-def content on new HD TVs will never look as good as either HD content or the way standard-def displays on old CRT technology - it's simply a trade-off the entire industry and consumer base must make.  By the way, that doesn't mean your DVD library is in trouble - I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fan, and my DVDs look spectacular on this new television (even when they were coming over 480i a/v from our older DVD player - we just upgraded to a new Panasonic blu-ray player which is upscanning and sending the DVD content over HDMI, and HOLY GOOD GANDALF it's amazing).Also important - you can easily deactivate the ambient light sensor that automatically changes TV brightness, another feature we did not find a good use for.Short version of this review:  this TV is a huge winner, offers amazing quality for this price, and we hope you'll be as happy with it as we are!", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not bad, Samsung", "Author": "C.

I am very pleased with the picture and performance. My girlfriend and I watched a couple of movies and there were two things that we noticed needed to be adjusted:1. We noticed that movies and TV looked almost \"too real\". Some people refer to this as the \"soap opera effect\". It is almost as if every movie you watch looks like a B-Movie. Luckily this is very simple to fix. All you have to do is hit the menu button and scroll to the \"picture options\". Once there, scroll down to \"Auto Motion Plus\". It is automatically set to standard. Select to turn this feature off. This will correct the \"soap opera effect\" in your viewing.

This auto motion plus feature may be great for watching sports but it was very distracting when watching movies and TV.2. When you are in a dimly lit room the screen gets very dark- too dark.

In low light conditions the corners bleed light when the screen is dark or nearly dark.

Generally there is a 2-4 hundred dollar price difference between the two models.  Although the spec sheets claim a difference of nearly a million in contrast ratios, no one who has seen both side by side can tell a difference in picture quality.  If there is a difference, it's too subtle to worry about.  The c6500 has Samsung and Yahoo apps.  However you can get nearly the same exact feature set by buying this 6300 and then purchasing a Samsung BD-c6500 blu-ray player.  The BD-c6500 doesn't have yahoo apps though so if you want/need amazon video on demand you're better off looking at the c6500.  Still if you can do without yahoo, you'll come out a few bucks ahead by going for the 6300 and the blu ray player, and of course you also end up with a nice blu ray player in the process.The other major difference between the two models is the stand and the frame.  The 6300 has a flat, black stand that, while utilitarian isn't that great aesthetically.  The 6500 has a 4 pronged silver stand that looks much more stylish.  If you plan to put the TV in an enclosure where the sides are hidden or obscured by cabinet walls then the 6300 is perfectly fine.  If you plan to use the TV on a simple table or stand, leaving the side of the TV exposed you may find the 6500 to be more stylish and elegant and worth the price premium.The 6300 has a black border but it's covered by a layer of thick, clear plastic.  It's possible for room lights to hit the clear plastic in a way that makes the black border appear like cheap, shiny plastic -- the kind you'd see on a $10.00 electronic item.  In a dim or dark room this isn't an issue and it's not an issue if your lights can be moved or adjusted to reduce the glare effect.  The 6500 has a brushed metallic border.  Again there's a layer of plastic but the 6500's metallic border sits on the outside.  There's no glare, and the frame is just much more appealing than the 6300.There's no difference in the sound quality between the two and it's decent enough sound for the most part although some digital sound systems used in movies (dolby I think) don't produce enough volume even at the max setting.  But for regular TV viewing it's loud enough.  The system will benefit greatly from a soundbar and subwoofer which are fairly cheap and practical.  However I would stay away from Samsung's soundbar which has the propensity to randomly decide to use a different input source once a week (regardless of whether the remote is in use at the time or not), this is a widely reported problem.Others have covered the brilliant picture in excruciating detail so I'll just leave this thought here: You will not be disappointed with the picture.So the final recommendation is this: Aesthetically the c6500 wins by a fairly large margin and the c6500 is probably worth the premium if it's going to be sitting alone on a stand or table.  The c6300 is probably the better choice if you're going to be putting the tv in a cabinet or a structure where the sides are not fully exposed.  Unless you need amazon video on demand there's no compelling reason to purchase a c6500 as you'll get everything but yahoo in the bd-c6500 blu ray player and still come out ahead in terms of price.  This aside there's no other real difference between the two units.That's pretty much it.  The only thing left is to remind you to pick up a few cheap HDMI cables here on Amazon.  You can get 3 or 4 for the price of ONE (their absolute cheapest) at the box electronic shops.  HDMI is a digital signal, the picture is either perfect or its not there at all; there is no in between and no gold plated, gas injected, turbo charged $100 cable is going to be able to provide a better picture than a $7.00 bargain bin special.

Setup is easy, and the menu is user friendly, with the manual as a good reference.The choice of this model over the Samsung LN46C630 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV (Black) was based on the hope that the LED back-lighting would provide a better quality and more electrically economic picture than the fluorescent lighting on the LN46C630. As I stated above, the picture was really good. In daylight.Night time viewing presented an issue, for me, when the image on the screen was of a dark scene, particularly when the room itself was dark (lights off for the \"full theater effect\"). The LED spotlighting became immediately noticeable as the corners seemed to beam a faint but very discernible light, ruining the black tones. I tried to adjust this out using gamma, brightness, black tone control, and only got a slight, but ineffectual change. Heartbroken, I took the set back, and picked up the LN46C630, which was over $300 less expensive. I haven't played around with it enough to review this model yet.Admittedly, spotlighting might not be an issue for many people, but for me, anyway, once I saw it, it was always there when viewing under the conditions I described above.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Automotion+ and Samsung Customer Support", "Author": "Nathan K.

The picture quality is TRULY incredible.  If you're considering buying a 46\" LCD, stop and take a look at this and look at it again after you consider other options.  You, like me, can have LED quality now at a fraction of the price you would pay to upgrade within another manufacturer's line.  I know four different households of friends and family with recently purchased LCD's and LED's (all of whom paid more than I did for this Samsung LED).  The fact that all of these households (men and women) agree that my Samsung has better picture quality and sound than what they have.  Note that some of them have added speakers as I intend to do, but I don't think this add-on will be pressing for me since I can hear it fine but want to hear it at its best at some point.  It's probably important to note that my friends and family's purchases were all within the past three to six months and none of them were new to HDTV.  I'm telling it to you accurately when I say that each of these households is sorry that they didn't see this set in a home before their purchases.What we may believe to be superior picture quality in a store and how we see them in our homes can be quite different.

Most of the reviews talked about  how the panel wasn't actually from Samsung or how the TV was broken after they got it shipped to them. The TV isn't supposed to by laid down and should not be shipped. Go to your local appliance store, I got a way better deal right after Christmas than I could find anywhere on the internet. Also, read the directions when setting up your TV! The quick quide is only one page! a few people kept complaining about how the TV was crooked when they set it up, and how it was clearly the stands fault. One guy even says how he returned the crooked TV and got a new one only to have it lean the other way. In the directions of setting up the TV, it says to screw the stand in sitting up so it will balance out and not be crooked because the stand is not adjustable. The speakers are not great, but you won't find any better on a flat screen. Do yourself a favor and buy some speaker to go with it. $50 speakers with a small subwoofer make it sound great.If TVs break, they almost all do within the first 2 years.

It's a fantastic deal at that time. Great looking TV with super sexy slim design.  Lightweight and easy to setup.  Amazing HD quality and higher than usual workmanship than the others.  There are plenty of HD hookups with optical out and even an ethernet feature which is extremely useful.  I find is suprising that a S-Video input is not available while the composite is still there.  But I don't miss it anyway.  Using the ethernet, I can connect and stream my media using DLNA from my PC and mobile phones without the need of another 3rd party device(Google or Apple TV).While there are other higher end Samsung models with more features, I find this one having the best balance of features for the price.  Wish it was 240Hz with Internet@connect Apps for YouTube and Netflix, 3-D ability, even slimmer, local dimming, and etc, but those cost much more and sometimes well more than double the $899 I paid.  Couldn't ask for more for the price and quality.  There's even an iPhone App too, but will require you to purchase the Samsun Wi-Fi dongle unless they update the firmware to work over eternet(Which I think they should).I also praise Amazon's amazing and outstanding customer service for my purchase and handling of any issues with the TV.

Hoyt", "ReviewID": "R1HS7PRP062SOE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked up this LED TV as a Best-Buy Doorbuster on Black Friday 2010.  Well, lets get down to business.  The picture quality on this TV is excellent, black levels are deep, color reproduction is surprisingly accurate, and natural.  The clarity is amazing, especially while playing Blu-rays.  I use a Playstation 3 for Blu-ray playback, and, I can tell you, the depth in the picture is astounding.  Naturally, I first popped in James Cameron's Avatar, as it is reference quality material, and it was almost 3d-like, the picture was so clear and beautiful.  Next, to get a more realistic idea of the TVs abilities, I put an older movie, 1995s Braveheart.  Again, I was blown away by what I was seeing, it is simply amazing.Now, Blu-rays and DVDs look excellent; however, watching regular TV is a different story.  The quality of the picture when watching TV (Comcast Cable in my case), is not only based off of the TV set, but the signal sources as well, meaning a cable or satellite box you are using.  The picture using my cable box/DVR is somewhat lack luster, but considering when the signal sources is a Blu-ray or DVD, and the picture looks fantastic, I think I can blame most of this on the Comcast cable equipment and signal.  The LED Motion Plus function is especially bad on when watching Cable, it makes the picture choppy as all hell.  However, again, I don't think this is the TVs fault, as Motion Enhancement, when in use with Blu-rays and DVDs, looks great (although, I only really use the function with animated films anyway).  The only time that LED Motion Plus works well is with sporting events, otherwise I just turn the function off.The really big drawbacks to this TV is the viewing angle and the edge light-bleeding.  Unless you are watching the TV straight-on, the picture will look extremely washed-out from all other angles.  This was really disappointing as even my three-year old 32-inch Panasonic LCD TV has better viewing angle capabilities than this set.  The other drawback is edge light-bleeding.  When watching films in a completely darkened room, during especially dark scenes, you will see what can only be described as a clouding effect around the edges of the picture.  Like I said it was only noticeable during very dark scenes, like scenes set in outer-space, but it is perceptible.Aesthetically the TV is beautiful.  It is super-thin, great for wall-mounting. It has a solid glass-base, that will also allow you to rotate the TV.  Can't really comment on the remote as I'm using a Logitec Harmony remote to control the set.

Basically, while they are still within Samsung specs, the underlying panels are made by varying manufacturers, and with differing results.The largest complaints about this monitor center around their \"local dimming\".  It turns out that yes, Samsung has a competition crushing display, but not when you are looking at even slightly dark scenes.* The gray looks DARK gray* The dark gray looks black* The black looks like someone ripped a hole in space-time.Now this makes many scenes completely unviewable.  Very common complaint.Also, and this took me by complete surprise, there is a reason that the big-box stores show a computer graphics loop on their sets.

These are GREAT TVs while they work but they seem to only work for a year or two..... I was about to buy numerous more Samsung TVs (for a new home) but upon learning of this issue I absolutely will not and I cannot understand why anyone else would.This review is not about this specific TV - I want to be very clear upfront. However it is about a Samsung tv I purchased in June 2008 for $2,500. At the time that was what LN52A650 was priced. Today May 12, 2011 the TV started to experience a very common problem which many (if not all) Samsung TVs are experiencing no matter what model - the unit would click on and off rapidly and there was no way to stop it but to unplug it. Last night my tv was fine and this am it would just click on and off rapidly - so the tv is totally useless.Luckily and unusually for me, I happened to have purchased a 5 year extended warranty when I purchased the unit so I wasn't too upset - I am lucky my unit will be fixed for free but if I didn't purchase that warranty (which is usually a huge waste of money) I would be stuck with a repair bill between $200 and $500 (assuming I didn't want to try and fix it myself). The good news seems to be that the issue can be repaired and if you do it yourself it will cost under $40, but you have to risk messing up your tv. For TVs that now cost $1,500 (55\"-52\") no one should have to worry about the unit breaking in a year or two and then having to do a self repair versus paying a few hundred dollars.The reason I am writing this review is because I was about to purchase LN46C630 to view until my unit was fixed, and in addition because I need to purchase about 4 new tvs for a recent new home. I was actually EXCITED about purchasing Samsung units - well until today at least. Since I would be purchasing TVs in the next few months I figured why stress about the repair - I could get the 46\" set and use it until the repair is completed. This morning I had no idea the defect was so common and felt my TV would be out of business for a month or so - now that I know the issue is common I hope that won't be the case. Even though I absolutely love the picture quality of this TV I can in no way purchase another Samsung knowing they have this issue and it appears Samsung knows their TVs have this problem.If anyone can recommend a TV with picture quality like the Samsung I would appreciate it - I am really bummed I cannot buy Samsung anymore but why would someone want to hassle with this issue in a year or two?

There are your typical sound modes (surround, music, etc.) but they really seem to only change the sound minimally.  If you're paying over a grand for a tv, I would imagine you also have a surround sound setup in your house so it doesn't really matter.I am not a fan of smooth motion effects.  I think they are gimmicky and as one reviewer mentioned \"cheap soap opera effect.\"  It looks like I'm watching some TV series when I'm watching my movies.  I've used it for sports and honestly I can't tell a difference.  Movies actually make me nauseous when I turn on the effect.  All it does is increase the frames-per-second (FPS) of the TV but only artificially increasing the movie's 24fps to 120 which only just multiplies each frame by about 5 so subtle movements or slow camera movements look almost as if they're in fast forward.  I would recomment turning off the smooth mode entirely as it really is gimmicky.The only complaints I could possibly have is the media sharing mode is very limited, it's slow, and it supports a small amount of codecs so don't expect to be streaming much media.  I was only able to get it to work on non-subscription-based music and pictures.  I could not however get it to stream any videos from my pc, any digital copies of movies or zune-based movies I've purchased didn't work and it didn't even recognize my Windows Phone 7 videos.

I thought about exchanging it but I doubt that I'll be lucky enough to get on that doesn't have the issue since most do.So, in conclusion, this TV is awesome. It looks great, sounds great, and has beautiful picture quality *except* some pesky uneven backlighting that I have decided to live with.

He had the 50\" model, and I was amazed because I had never seen a picture so clear.  I recently decided to purchase this model, but became somewhat concerned when I read all of the people complaining about \"light leakage\".  I installed this TV last week and all I can say is WOW.  I had a three year old 40\" 1080 Hitachi plasma and comparing the picture and the sound from the new to the old television is like night and day.  It is like I'm there live with whatever we are watching...The picture is fantastic.I'm not a television critic or anything, but I consider myself a bit particular...I want good quality, but I'm not willing to pay a crazy (a couple of thousand for a TV seems crazy to me) amount of money for it.  My opinion is that I haven't seen a better picture quality on any television ever, and I paid under $1k for mine. I have no idea what some of the reviewers are talking about when they mention \"light leakage\".  There is no flaw whatsoever that I can find.  Of course, I'm not using this in a completely dark theater room or anything and I'm not really looking for a flaw with it.  I'm just watching it and am amazed at the clarity.  I've got a surround sound system, but the sound coming from the TV itself is much better than my old set and probably would be perfectly acceptable for most.I purchased one of the used-good condition models and I didn't have any problems at all.  All of the stuff including the TV was packaged as new.I would have liked to have had netflix, etc. available on the TV, but since I already have all of that stuff through my Blu-Ray player, I chose not to spend more money and duplicate it.  Probably would have been more convienent to have it through the television but I didn't think that it was worth the extra money.All in all, I'm more than happy with this purchase.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN46C6300 LED TV", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R2V73T0ITUB4MU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung UN46C6300 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTV has a very bright, clear image with realistic colors.

Amazon delivery was excellent, they delivered and even set it up which I was not expecting!. Sound quality is OK as long as you use it for day to day news and TV programs.Coming to the issues, I can feel the soap opera effect (movies looks like shot in handycam, ie unwanted real picture effect) if watching any DVD movies. I am overcoming slightly by switching the Automotion plus to off and changing the picture mode to movies.Samsung needs to do something about this more than expected quality on movies. The user manaul is not very explanatory ( still I could not find the difference between LED motion plus and Auto motion plus feature), the samsung first level of support is useless.

Now that I have everything connected to it, was glad to purchase a 1080 up conversion dvd player for it for my old DVDs (Gone in 60 seconds looks strangely realistic for a movie I originally saw on VHS). The combo of the TV and DVD player made me go out and get HD cable now. I am completely satisfied with the television purchase. I did however, find the stock speakers on the television average, wasn't worth dropping my six year old surround sound system. My only complaint was when connecting it to my speak system I didn't have the choice of using analogue outputs unless an addition part was purchased (Note: Understandable, my system was 6 years old). But when I went to a local electronics department store, I opted for the digital output cables. Which was a good choice for ease of access. Whenever you start up like a DvD the TV will auto switch to the movie which is nice, it just doesn't seem to do it going back to TV, my guests usually have to call me to find out how to switch it back. It's a short conversation however, but they assume it just transfers between sources by a button rather then going through the menu. Currently have my PC connected to it and it runs without any problems, great for netflicks watching. Excellent TV if you want a \"Regular TV\", I was interested in the new internet TV gimmicks, but I'd rather buy the add-on google-tv or whatever than sacrifice quality for those features right now.In summary - Great picture, consider connections for your speaker system if you have one, Excellent TV if you want a \"Regular TV\" and not some giant phone TV with all the app's.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE FLASHLIGHTING", "Author": "C.

Samsung's name always came up among the best TVs out there and this one was in my price range with the features I wanted.  I wanted LED and edge-lit was the only option in my budget.  I honestly don't know if mine was defective or if it's just normal for edge-lit LED, but I was unimpressed.  The first day I had it, I noticed the flashlighting in the corners and clouding all along the left bezel.  For weeks I tried to live with it, and read forums enough to know that flashlighting and clouding can be normal with edge-lighting.  But I didn't spend $1000 to have a TV I couldn't watch at night without noticing problems.  So I contacted Samsung's warranty service, and they were very nice.  But the first two times I spoke with them, they outright lied about it.  The first rep told me it was from compression in the box and would go away after a few weeks.  The second rep said to turn down the backlight to 7 for a week and it would fix it.  Finally, I put in a repair request and the local Samsung authorized repair place called me.  He told me that the suggestions from the Samsung reps were not true at all, and he encouraged me to return the TV rather than go through the repair process.  (He was very nice and helpful.)  I returned it to Best Buy and they couldn't see the problems in their bright store.  But eventually, they gave me my money back.  (I would bet they put that TV right back on the shelf though.)Though in daylight the TV had good color, the flashlighting and clouding were unacceptable at night.  Also, I was disappointed in the viewing angles.  It washed out very quickly if you sat just a little to the side.After returning this one, I ordered the Vizio xvt473sv from Amazon and it's amazing!

You can order a calibration DVD from Amazon (or elsewhere) or use any recent Pixar movie (in the set-up section of the DVD) to do this. This is especially important because many DVDs pump up the contrast to compensate for the lack of blacks on \"regular\" LCDs and CRTs and on the LED, the shadows block up badly and the skin tones look cartoony.2) The custom settings are unique to each input (e.g. A.V., TV, HDMI 1, etc.) and not universal.

The picture is great and the load of features is nice to have. I have had no problems with the unit.  I love the remote too. All the features I could ask for or ever need.  I mounted it in a video lift cabinet and that was a bit of a problem.  The manual with the TV does not say how long the bolts need to be. I was worried about getting bolts too long as I didn't want to damage the internals (which is what the manual said too, but it didn't mention anything about what length to buy). The manual did have the gauge and type (M8). I called Samsung support and got somebody who had to look it up. She read the same manual I did and told me M8. After I explained about size and length, she asked a supervisor who didn't know either. If Samsung doesn't know then who does? Luckuly, my video lift manual gave a suggestion of 3/4 - 1 inch in length so I went with that and it worked. I did have to use about five spacers on each bolt so the mounting brackets wouldn't be so close to the TV.  The brackets were covering up most of my inputs!

It's tiny compared to my old 42\" Visio LCD, so much so that you can hardly notice it when looking at it from the side. The exterior of the television is sleek, with an all-glass panel giving it an elegant design that will look good in any room you put it in. The controls for the television took me a little bit to find, as there are no buttons, but rather touch-sensitive areas along the bottom-right of the television.Setup of the unit was easy enough, but I highly recommend getting a wall mount for this as the base plate for me seemed slightly malformed and didn't want to fit right away. As it is, not all the screws would fit, and I ended up having to get some longer screws to finish securing it. I'm not sure if they're all like this or if it happened to be the result of storage, heat, and shipping. However you choose to set it up, it's extremely light and took very little effort to lift it onto our TV stand.The picture quality is amazing on this television. I use this screen for my xbox (games and netflix), my Blu-Ray player, and one of our computers. Even the difference in image quality between my old television at full 1080p and this one is almost unreal. There's almost no perceptible blur (you might see a little in an action sequence or two, but unlikely unless you have amazingly good eyes and visual response time), and the blacks are, well, black.My one real complaint with this television is the same one that I have with all televisions.

In a way, it was a shame that we abandoned using the supplied stand since cables are nicely handled and essentially invisible.A note here about cables and this machine: forget using the really big Monster and AR HDMI cables. They simply can't be made to fit the routing detents on the back of the TV. I used CablesToGo HDMI's which are much cheaper, more flexible and totally adequate.For wall mounting, we used a SolidMounts UT-600 (which provides 15 degrees of tilt we didn't require) and the resulting assembly is only about 3 inches screen-to-wall. This mount will hold 175 lb. of weight which is very adequate for the 35 lb.

Stensrud", "ReviewID": "R3Q2YO2EIAORP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv was bought for a wall installation in a family room. The wall is opposite full length windows, and the room is quite bright during the day. The entrance into the room goes past the tv wall, making a thin profile advantageous.After comparing available sets in the 46-47 inch range, we settled on this Samsung. Amazon prime delivery was prompt. Set up was quite simple. The menus are intuitive. Sources are a DirecTV HD DVR and a Gen 1 Apple TV. Picture is overall excellent with good colors and surprisingly deep blacks (point of reference is the Pioneer Kuro plasma set downstairs...blacks are deeper on the plasma, but not as much as I would have expected). The edge lighting of the LEDs is perceptible, but I don't find it bothersome...the price of thinness, I guess.Speaking of the price of thinness, the viewing angle is unsurprisingly not quite as good as a plasma. However, the picture is still excellent from the vantage point of the one chair that is about 50 degrees off angle. At that point there is some minor color washout, but not enough to be bothersome for the casual viewing that we do in this location.I don't use the included remote,  I use the satellite box remote to control things. I have been pleasantly surprised by the speakers, which are quite adequate. For real home theater experience a sound bar or surround system would be better, but for casual watching the speakers are quite adequate, Both in volume and sound quality. I have been very impressed with the lack of screen glare, even on sunny winter days. There is no noticeable glare on this set, in lighting conditions that I would describe as difficult.I would not recommend this tv as a main home theater set, due to the slightly limited viewing angles and edge lit LED appearance.

But it is a super thin edge-lit TV, and suffers from the same issues that all other edge-lit HDTVs suffer from:  occasional light-leak on the edges in certain situations and less-than-stellar quality from the built-in speakers.The light leak from the edge-lit sides is a little worse than I expected in a very dark room.  If you watch this in a dark room, you'll notice it a lot with movies that are letterboxed.  I mean: Anything you're watching that has black bars on the top/bottom or sides, you'll notice bright parts (or bad black levels) on the side edges of the display if you're in a very dark room.  This is because an edge-lit TV gets 100% of its light from the sides, not from directly behind the display.I don't think this is an issue with this specific television, but an issue with the edge-lit LED technology in general.  If you watch this TV in a room with a few lights on, you won't notice the leak.If you are going to watch this TV in a pitch-black room for movies that may be letterboxed, you may want to consider spending a little more money for an LED backlit HDTV that is full array, as opposed to edge lit.The sound that comes out of this TV is OK.  Not great.  If you're looking for some great booming sound to go with this TV, you'll probably want to invest in an external sound system.  Again, I don't think this is an issue with this particular TV, but an issue with these very thin/light TVs in general.  Because the TV is so thin, the size of the speaker they can cram into the case is relatively small/weak.Another thing about a 1080p 120hz television:  Unless you're going to watch Blu-Ray movies, you don't need this technology.  HDTV is only broadcasted in 1080i at 60hz.  Same with most all DVD players.  So you may not need a picture quality this good if you don't care about Blu-Ray.The inputs:  Beware!  There is no composite input, only component input.  Composite is the single RCA video connection (usually color-coded yellow).  Component is the three RCA video connection, color coded with Red/Green/Blue.  This TV does NOT have a composite connection.  For example, my Nintendo Gamecube (old!) has a composite video connection, and I cannot use it with this TV.This TV is a DLNA compatible device.  I can stream video to it via \"PS3 Media Server\" software (Mac OS X), no problem.  There is official Samsung software you can use to do this is you use Windows.  It can allegedly also play divx/mpeg/etc. via media plugged into its USB port, though I have yet to test this.If I had to do it all over again, I would either spend more money and get an LED backlit TV that is full array; not edge-lit.  Or I would spend less money and get a classically backlit HDTV.Other than my gripe about the edge-lit light leak, this HDTV is very good.

When I got it I didn't noticed that it was the exact TV my parents have but 46 inches instead of 55, so I immediately was like, \"oh, this is going to be nice.\" It definitely has been. I mounted it on my wall, slightly tilted down, have a HD DVR and a PC connected into it. It's a gaming PC at maximum settings and I have to say it's the best picture I've ever seen. No dead pixels, low heat and low power consumption. The backlight of the TV auto adjusts depending on what's showing, so that's nice. it's 120hz too, so that's good. It does have that auto smoothing thing called the \"soap opera effect\" which I now understand why it's called that.To my surprise it has a built in Media Center. With the 2 USB ports you can actually plug in your flash drives or external hard drives and watch your movies and shows. It can also read pictures and music. The other option to hauling your USB drives around is using the network. Samsung offers a wireless adapter you can plug in to gain network access or just use an ethernet cable. Samsung says you need their PC Media Manager program in windows to share programs to the TV, but it's slow as heck and doesn't auto update the library when you add more files to the folder. It can, however, see your windows shared folders. I haven't really been able to access them, but since it can see them, there must be a way.The only con I could even think of is that it's too closely priced to it's 3D counter-part. I think 3D is a waste of time at the 720 and lower resolutions, some 1080 shows too. Maybe when it's higher, but for now, in my opinion, it looks like layered cut-outs.So yea, I would recommend this as a gift to you are your friends.

For Christmas we gave ourselves a new TV, HD Cable (our southern skyline is blocked, no satellite for us), and sound bar. And it all needed to mount on the wall, not dominate our family room, look good and sound good. And get rid of speakers and wires everywhere. After a ton of searching and research, we settled on 46\" LCD-LED backlight as our best bet. We got the system at Best Buy, not Amazon, since a friend of ours is a store general manager and he took good care of us.What we got:Samsung UN46C6300 TVRocketfish full motion wall mountSamsung sound barTiVo Premiere systemThe Geek Squad came out and installed it and did a great job getting on the wall right where we wanted it, hooking everything up and even hauling off our packing materials and boxes so we wouldn't have to do it ourselves.What a difference! The TV picture in HiDef is incredible, vibrant, clear and detailed. It did require some calibration. If you turn the TV with the default picture settings, the HD movies and shows look unreal, almost like a Polar Express style cartoon ..... which looked really odd when we put in Polar Express! But once calibrated, the picture was great. The viewing angle is amazing. And we no longer have the screen washed out by the glare from our south facing windows in our family room.I can't really rate the speakers because we never turned them on. That said, I think anyone buying a Samsung TV in this class and price range should just go ahead and get the Samsung sound bar. It is 80% of a surround system, takes up essentially no extra space in your home theater space and is controlled by the same remote as the TV. It's a great addition and really brings the sound quality up to a more than acceptable level.DVDs playing on our DVD player still look quite good on this TV, but we are definitely going to add a Blu-Ray player soon. TiVo Premiere allows us to stream Netflix very easily and the movies and tv shows from the Instant Queue playback great. The TiVo peanut remote was able to be programmed for the TV very easily and we now control power, volume, input, etc. from the same remote as cable and TiVo are controlled from. If we get a Samsung Blu-Ray player I think we will achieve the nirvana of one remote WITHOUT having to buy one of those very expensive universal remotes by Harmon or Logitech.I can't speak highly enough of this TV, but I think adding on the extra components that we added made a significant difference.

Basically film is shot in 24 frames per second and video is actually smoother, 30 frames (or 60 interlaced \"fields\") ... so we are used to this and I suggest you turn it off.

The two products communicate well together, so I can use the TV remote primarily.  Netflix streams in amazingly well through the Blue Ray player, so it has become my primary source of entertainment. The HD content on Netflix looks great on the TV.  \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\" streams in at HD quality and it looked incredible!What I like:-It is thin, and with the specific wall mount, it sits right against the wall.-It doesn't use much energy.  It has had little to no effect on my electric bill.  I upgraded from a really small TV and was expecting an increased cost, but the bill has only gone down.  You will need to play with the display setting in order to see the savings though.-The picture is amazing.  The color and black levels are great.-Versatility: HDMI, Component RCA, VGA, and USB port all work great.  The USB media player works well, but some videos formats don't work.  Check the owner's manual to find out what formats work.Dislikes:-There is a lot of glare.  It falls between a matte finished LCD and a glass finished Plasma TV.-The premium cost.-The \"Anyconnect\" technology between the two Samsung devices can be annoying.  It is sometimes finicky and the Blue Ray player freezes occasionally because of it.-The \"Settings\" interface can be confusing.  It can be difficult to find specific settings, so make sure the owner's manual is readily available for referencing.-You will need to develop a cable management system to keep the wall looking clean.-Due to the slim nature of the TV, all my other equipment looks gigantic now.Overall, I love the TV and would recommend it to anyone.

There was also a 1' section in the middle of the screen that showed dark grey instead of black.  While watching films in letterbox, the LED side lighting in the corners was especially distracting.  We took the TV back from where we purchased it -- after inspecting the floor model, the light corners were present but not nearly as evident but that was only because the store was so well lit.  Viewing close up, the floor model was showing the same thing in each corner of the TV.  Samsung has sacrificed the quality of its previous back lit TVs to make the TV thinner (and cheaper to manufacture) with the side lit LED.The remote is big and clunky.The front panel buttons are very difficult to see and manipulate.I'm very disappointed with this TV as I have been a loyal Samsung fan for a long time.For anyone considering this TV or other LCD-LED TVs, I highly recommend you do your homework on the Side Lit vs. full array back lit.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Clouding and Flashlighting Issues", "Author": "bz_sleeper", "ReviewID": "R2BY0E85TEUVVX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok, I'm not going to go into much in regards to the good things about a product because I believe what people are really interested in most are the issues.... and this TV has them. They are as follows:1. Flashlighting and CloudingWhen viewed in low light or dark rooms, clouding and flashlighting is a serious problem with this TV. At least on mine. If you don't know what it is, it's the backlighting leaking light onto the screen during dark scenes and/or when the TV is viewed in a dark room. (Google \"LED Samsung Clouding Flashlighting\".) All LCDs have some form of this but it's usually not too bad. I have an older Samsung LCD and it only exhibits a slight consistent glow on the edges. However this TV has it pretty bad. The effect is uneven. There might me an issue with the TV I have because, aside from 2 or 3 other reviews, most people reviewing this here do not mention the problem. However, it may also be due to viewing habits. If you watch TV exclusively in a room with alot of light, you will not see the problem even though it is there. But if you will be watching in the dark every now and then, it will likely appear. The problem may also be worse because of the edge-lit LED, not sure though. Take this into consideration before purchasing.2. Lag during video games.The video game lag on this TV is worse than on my older LCD. I can play most games on this but only after turning down (or off) all of the \"smoothing\" type settings depending on the type of game. It helps but still not as good as with my older TV. This is unfortunate because one would hope a newer TV like this would have improved processing. Too bad the games look great with special settings turned on, just not too playable.3. Remote ControlVery poor design. Some of the buttons (usually the ones that allow you to adjust TV settings and navigate the menus) are flat, smooth and crowded too close together that it's very difficult to \"feel\" for the right button to press. Some of the buttons don't even light up or glow when the remote control light is enabled. Can be tricky. I find myself pressing the wrong button often.4. SoundShouldn't really be a prime feature for a TV but like everyone says, the sound stinks on this one. Get a receiver and speakers for better sound.5.

The sound quality isn't so hot, even after adjusting the built in equalizer, but then again that's what my audio system is for.The remote could be designed better, some buttons could be grouped together better, (it almost seems ultra-lazy to talk about button placement on a remote) but it is back-lit which is a nice feature.My TV came through with set of component ports which work well with my old VCR, the TV works great with the output from the HDMI port from the video card on my computer, and the TV has another port should I choose to directly connect a (non-DVI) VGA connector from yet another computer (don't know why I'd do that yet . . .). It also has a port to connect it to my router (RJ-45 jack).On a same class to class comparison, I think the Sony's produces a better picture, it's just that it's not worth, to me, to spend the significant extra money.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good buy................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... .....", "Author": "rbarban", "ReviewID": "R2MB1TS9I7ECPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good buy................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... .....  ccc cccc  .... . .. . . .", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN 46C6300  46\" 120motion LED HDTV", "Author": "z_works", "ReviewID": "R38K5RQR82TFZ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV ROCKS!!

We took a gamble and ordered one.Well, we did get the one CN02 model...and I feared the worst. Figured we'd have to send it back.However, we really couldn't tell a difference between the CN02 or the SQ01, which was supposed to have been better one. No bleeding and no issues. So, regardless of where a thing is made, we are all in a crap shoot on what we will get. Thankfully, we got a good one.Both are nice TVs. Most of these flat panels don't have the best of sound, and I can't attest to their sound quality as we have speaker systems hooked up and wouldn't want it any other way. :)My only concern with both TVs is that they are supposed to be 120hz, and on both of the TVs it is stated at 60hz...and, indeed, that is all that our TV shows at the upper left corner is 60hz...we were told it is only displaying what our cable receiver is sending us and that is actually is refreshing at 120hz...but, with the display showing only 60hz and the back showing 60hz...it makes me wonder...", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "This one has to be the bang for the buck winner right now", "Author": "Michael M.

First, I want to describe my purchase and delivery experience.On a whim, I decided to just go for it, and buy this TV that's been sitting in my Wish List for months now. So, on Thanksgiving, while sitting at my desk at work... ummm... doing... work... I said \"what the hay,\" and I placed the order.I did plenty of research prior to my purchase, and I almost got suckered into buying a Samsung 46-inch LED TV (UN46C5000) from another store (rhymes with \"doll-fart\") for $899.99; however, this particular LED TV was 60Hz, and if there's one thing I knew, it's that I wanted at least 120Hz. (And I'm glad that I purchased when I did, as I got the TV for $1,099.99, and only two days after my purchase the price went back up to $1,599.99.)But, I digress... So, I placed my order, and I scheduled my delivery date with Pilot Freight (the company that transports and delivers your TV) for Thursday, 02 December, 2010 (between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM), even though I could've gone for Wednesday, 01 December, 2010, (between 12:00 PM and 5:00 PM), I would be at work both days, from 6:00 AM until 4:30 PM, so it seemed more logical to book the delivery time with the smaller window as I would have to leave work early and make up the time away from work on another day.The following day, I checked the status of the order and found that the TV shipped just a couple hours after I placed the order (on Thanksgiving and everything!). As the weekend rolled around, Thursday was lookin' pretty far away, and I started getting antsy, having second thoughts (\"should've just eaten the sales tax and purchased locally\"), etc. These feelings were amplified when I checked the tracking info on Sunday and found that the TV was within the city limits, just a few miles from my place.On Monday, I got this crazy idea: Call the shipping company, and see if it's possible for them to deliver the TV earlier than I originally scheduled! I did just that... And what do you think happened? They told me that the earliest they could get the package to me was the following day! Suffice it to say that I was stoked; I don't work on Tuesday, so I'd be home all day.The TV arrived the following day (Tuesday, 30 November, 2010), around 2:15 PM. I helped the delivery guy carry it up, and I told him about my concern regarding the powering on of a TV of this magnitude that's been sitting in freezing temps for prolonged periods of time. He totally agreed that the TV should not be powered on for a good twenty-four hours, and told me to give a call if I had any problems powering it on; if so, I could file a claim, the TV would be shipped back (free of charge) and a new one would already be on its way. So, I unpacked the thing, and placed it in a room where it could \"thaw.\"As soon as I got home the following day, I got to work setting up this beautiful work of art. Assembling the base was quick and easy, involving a set of five long(ish) screws. The hardest part was lowering the TV into the base and securing it, but even this task was moderately simple, and only took five minutes max. (Please note: do NOT attempt this step by yourself. Unless you want to crack the glass, or snap the TV in half, have someone help you lift the TV and guide it into the base; once it clicks into place, you're okay with supporting it using one hand or an elbow while you secure it with the second set of five screws).After disconnecting my PS3 from my old, and now obsolete, LCD TV, and reconnecting it to The Beast (aka, Black Beauty), I commenced the launch ceremony...Until you see Old Snake's face rendered on an LED TV (I have the Metal Gear Solid 4 theme installed on my PS3), specifically *this* LED TV, you can't really comprehend the absolutely stunning, jaw-dropping, visually orgasmic image that presented itself to me; and this was something I'd seen before, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of times on my LCD. I was literally shocked when I watched Avatar... And Modern Warfare 2? Gorgeous. Perfect. Astounding. I could go on forever. Seriously.Some people are complaining about the sound quality, but what do you expect from a TV that's an inch-and-a-half deep? Personally, I think this TV sounds GREAT. Definitely a lot better than what I expected after reading peoples' reviews.Set-up is a breeze as well. Very intuitive interface; user-friendly. I'm still trying to figure out, however, what this gauge represents: When you click the \"Info\" button on the remote, a circular gauge appears in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, and it's reminiscent of a gas gauge in a car; it has a needle, with a high and low spectrum (the left-half of the gauge, or the \"high\" spectrum says \"LED TV,\" the right-half of the gauge, presumably the \"low\" spectrum says \"Conventional TV\"), along with a little battery-shaped meter or gauge directly beneath the needle. There's absolutely no info about this in the owner's manual. I want to figure out what influences the needle to go \"up\" (left) or \"down\" (right).I've noticed some peculiarities, however, especially when watching movies. I was messing around with the menu while watching a movie, and I turned on the \"LED Motion Plus\" feature and something really, really, really didn't look right. After enabling this feature, the movie looked beyond weird; it's really hard to explain, but it looked like film that hadn't been finalized yet. You know when you watch deleted scenes on a movie, or when you watch the \"Making Of\" a film and it has that unfinished look to it? The closest analogy that comes to mind is a Soap Opera; with this feature turned on, the Blu-ray film I was watching went from looking like it cost $500 million to produce, to looking more like a low-budget, daytime episode of \"Days of our Lives\" or \"The Young and the Restless.\"The \"Auto Motion Plus\" feature had a similar effect, and when I did the available comparison demo, which allows you the ability of viewing each of the four modes (Clear, Standard, Smooth, Custom) one at a time on a split screen; one half of the screen shows you what the image looks like with \"Auto Motion Plus\" off, the other half show you what the image will look like when one of the modes is activated. I found that the image always looked better with the feature turned off.Something else worth mentioning is that, even with \"Game Mode\" activated, I still experience \"tracers\" or \"drag,\" especially in darker areas of a map, and when there's a lot of action on the screen. I was under the impression that \"Game Mode\" was a function that helped to eliminate \"lag\" or \"ghost images\" for high speed gaming.I also never know what my refresh rate is; although the TV is said to achieve 120 Hz, but when I press the \"Info\" button, it always states \"@60 Hz.\"And, the original HDMI cable I used to connect my PS3 to my Samsung LCD TV is one of those thick, braided-type cables, that isn't very flexible at all. When connecting this cable to the HDMI input, the thickness of the cable prevented the actual connector from sitting flush, or parallel, to the body of the TV. Therefore, I purchased an HDMI connector with a more flexible cable so as to prevent damage to the TV's HDMI receptacle. However, I think the new cable has affected the quality of the image, but cannot say for sure. With all the different types of cables out there, and all the hyperbole that goes along with purchasing these cables, I can't tell if the quality degradation is genuine or more a figment of my imagination.I do wish the manufacturers of these cables would implement more transparency when marketing and packaging their products, and at the very least provide the \"Version\" (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4), if not the \"Category\" (Category 1 or Category 2) and/or \"Type\" (Type A, Type B, Type C, Type D, or Type E) of HDMI cable you're going to purchase. When shopping for a cable, I only found a single cable -- out of 20+ -- that stated specifically what \"Version\" it was; it was a Philips HDMI cable for $5.00 or so, and it clearly stated on the front of the packaging that it was a \"1.3a/b version\" cable. All the others provided none of this assumingly relevant information.Personally, I don't think it's healthy to stress out so much over what kind of cable to buy, and I've heard that since the signal(s) is digital, you'll get the same performance and results from a $5.00 HDMI cable as you would from a $130.00 HDMI cable from Monster.Regardless...

And for the price, these faults are entirely unacceptable.I've gone through 3 of these sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) in an attempt to remedy the following 6 faults. I've finally given up and requested a Samsung Field Rep come to view the set.1.) Unacceptable random LED light leakage; bleed through in all corners as well as across the screen when viewed in low light situations (similar to a theater setting). The resulting BLACK colors/shades/gradients appear similar to a nighttime overcast sky (cloudy skies reflecting a city's lights), an affect resulting in picture gradient inaccuracy, inconstancy.The only way to overcome this issue is to fill the viewing room and maintain with (simulated) daytime lighting (i.e., Costco Warehouse).This malfunction was experienced with all 3 sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) tested.2.) Samsung AutoMotion Plus results in randomly generated dropped frames and shutter with ALL inputs (OTA, Samsung Blue-ray 5500c, Wii, Dish Network ViP722k) with the exception of streaming content.This malfunction was experienced with all 3 sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) tested.NOTE: All devices are connected with Samsung high-speed HDMi cables with the exception of OTA (Over The Air) using coax and the Wii utilizing component connections (480).In a CNET post found yesterday (dated 5/9/10) Samsung officially recommends turning OFF the AutoMotion Plus feature - But by doing so one degrades the picture quality you've paid a premium for.Q: Why does Samsung feature AutoMotion Plus in the first place if it doesn't work, even when used in conjunction with its own 5500c Blu-ray player?!!.[...]3.) The set's (UN46C6400RFXZA) OS (Operating System) is seemingly buggy, resulting in random freeze-ups requiring occasional hard re-boot (pulling power cord and then restoring which will result in certain settings being lost).This malfunction was experienced with all 3 sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) tested.4.) The Netflix application occasionally freezes up rendering the set completely unusable requiring a hard re-boot (pulling power cord and then restoring which will result in certain settings being lost).This malfunction was experienced with all 3 sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) tested.5.) Internet@TV and its applications are buggy resulting in crashes that freeze up the set (UN46C6400RFXZA). These random freeze-ups require hard re-boot (pulling power cord and then restoring which will result in certain settings being lost).This malfunction was experienced with all 3 sets (UN46C6400RFXZA) tested.6.) Netflix streaming in approximately 40% of its use appears to have difficulty maintaining a consistent stream when viewed through the set (UN46C6400RFXZA) vs the Samsung (5500c) Blu-ray player. The Samsung (5500c) Blu-ray player has double the memory for cache, an entirely different OS, entirely different major (widget) applications than its LED LCD (UN46C6400RFXZA) counterpart - The Samsung (5500c) Blu-ray player appears to maintain a much more reliable and stable streaming platform than the set (UN46C6400RFXZA).ALL 3 SETS WERE PURCHASED FROM THE SAME COSTCO - THE LAST WAS PURCHASED 7/9/10.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this TV online.", "Author": "J\u00e4ger", "ReviewID": "R3DLWRL17WP3LB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just received mine and it does not work.

Before purchasing, google \"Samsung flicker\" or \"Samsung capacitors\" (in each case, without the quotes). There is a lot of information on the Internet indicating that Samsung's off-shore manufacturers have used faulty capacitors in their unit power supply--apparently this problem affects both Samsung TV's and monitors. When this happens, you will not notice anything wrong at first, as it takes the capacitors time to fail (google \"capacitor plague\") but when they start failing you will experience flickering and dimness at first and can expect this to get worse over time and for the unit to finally completely fail.If you are lucky, you will have problems while the unit is still under warranty. However, the replacement unit you receive may have the same problems, and when it fails will almost certainly be out of warranty.My experience: Samsung replaced my unit on warranty, but the replacement unit they sent me failed (with the issues described) shortly afterwards and was \"out of warranty.\" While I didn't expect much I did call Samsung customer service to see if they had any program to address this. They do not. Once the warranty is over, you're on your own. At the price they quoted it really isn't worth fixing it, so it looks like I'm stuck with a very expensive paperweight.

Two hours later, I DO NOT receive a shipping label from her; I receive a request for service ticket!!!! Had to call back, get another manager and request a shipping label.

After careful research on Amazon I ordered this Samsung TV on my account.

This means that here, in 2011, Samsung only supports Windows not Mac OS. I called Samsung and their tech support confirmed it. I then called Amazon customer service and cancelled, criticizing Amazon for not stating this. (Customer service did a great job, canceling even though my order was past the deadline for cancellations and changes.) Seems like it's still 1999 in Samsung's windows only world. And in Amazon's, at least when it comes to Samsung TV'.  On the Samsung forums, you can see that MacIntosh buyers who got stuck with non-compatible TV's have been pleading with Samsung to support Mac's for all these years.
