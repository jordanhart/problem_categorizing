{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect TV", "Author": "Dustin Farahnak", "ReviewID": "RC580X7V25Y3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nicely built television.Plenty of hookups, which were easy to reach.The Anyconnect (which allows one device to control another like Sony's Bravia, but for Samsung) works well.  It's nothing super, but it works.You can save favorite channels, easily and quickly switch to other inputs, play mp3s and jpgs via USB, ... ya know, all that stuff that you expect from a very nice TV.  It's not going to surprise you much.  The video didn't need any adjustment for me, out of the box, but there were a lot of options for tweaking it.Audio was average, not impressive, but I'm used to a nice surround system (which I promptly hooked up).  One reason Anyconnect is nice is that I can have the TV output over the surround sound (an Anyconnect system) very easily.Oh, and the dang stand swivels.  It's a heavy-ish stand, too.  Another commenter had a problem 'drilling' the stand, but I found this wasn't an issue.  I found the build quality to be the best I've ever seen on a TV.The picture, though, of course, is what matters most.  And this TV has an amazing picture.  Clear and beautiful.  The colors stand out, the contrast is strong, the blacks look black.The statistic that is weak on this TV is its slow refresh rate (the 60hz).  I actually prefer this TV over ones that have a higher refresh rate.  Movies look more like the cinema this way.  In fact, many movies are shown in theater at merely 24 hz.  Have you ever noticed that a movie or TV show looks subtly like a camcorder, behind the scenes tape, or a Soup Opera?  This effect is often the result of a high refresh rate, and it reduces the mental blur from frame to frame.  I suspect newer TVs actually let you reduce the refresh rate, because many find a high refresh to be less appealing.  But this way I get a cheaper TV that I think actually looks much better.  Before you spend hundreds more on a 2D set with extremely high refresh rate, test it out and see what you like better.  Make sure the media actually supports the high refresh rate.  You may find this cheaper set is as good, or perhaps better if you're like me.I found no flaws with this TV whatsoever.  It's amazing that such a large and beautiful TV, from what many consider the best brand, is so affordable.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV", "Author": "Jedidad", "ReviewID": "R3MULXE8M77K7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh my, this is a beautiful TV. This TV is the first LCD HD TV I've ever bought. I've been watching a 10 yr old JVC CRT set that has served me well. However, it's only 30\" and I wanted a larger screen.I was hesitant to buy an LCD TV since my old CRT is still putting out the sharpest picture around. But after getting the Samsung 46\" and hooking it to my cable HD box I can say that I don't regret the purchase. I'm blown away at the quality of the picture.I also bought a Samsung Blu-Ray player and the quality of movies are unbelievable. I'm sorry I waited until now to go HD.I highly recommend this TV.One month update: I was a bit concerned with this TV being only 60Hz since I watch a lot of sports but I have not had any problems at all. Just recently watched almost every match of the World Cup and had no problems whatsoever with blurring or anything. NASCAR is beautiful on this set.I've got my old CRT set in my bedroom. It looks crappy now, LOL!", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "0ldman", "ReviewID": "R27XZVVLSJ4X4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just an update... November 2013I've had the TV for three years now. Absolutely reliable, picture is still beautiful.I do wish it had a higher refresh rate and Auto Motion or whatever Samsung calls it, but I've found a work around with my computer, which is connected to the TV anyway.Bottom line, 3 years in, still happy with my purchase.-----I've had this TV for a month.I have a PS2, PS3, PC and DirecTV connected to it.The audio isn't great, but just slightly below average for a TV. The speakers facing downward make for a very clean look, but sound is just a bit spacey, but very clear. I have a home theater setup and didn't expect much out of the built in speakers. I was looking for a high quality 46 inch LCD monitor and that is what I got.As far as gaming lag, nonexistent.The picture quality is excellent. If you use Eco mode, brightness has to be adjusted up to make up the difference, otherwise the picture is just a bit too dark.With the backlight set to 8, the brightness set to 42 colors pop and blacks are black. It is a tad bright when watching at night with all the lights off, but Eco mode takes care of this. In Eco mode, brightness set to 10 is comparable to 8 without Eco mode.I did turn off the digital noise remover and edge enhancement, the MP4 noise filter is still enabled. With everything set default the picture was a little too smooth.We've watched HD movies and played a lot of games at 1920x1080, perfect performance and picture.I've recommended this TV to my friends. Thoroughly enjoyed this purchase.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "Debs", "ReviewID": "R2UGQV510JQK57", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The black Friday price point ($700.00) is what pulled me in. Great TV in this price range. The only issue I have with it is the motion strobe. This is my second HD LCD purchase. My first was a 40 inch Sony Bravia (also 60hz). My experience with that TV was the motion blur was barely noticeable, so when I bought the Samsung, I expected a similar experience. This is not the case. The blue is REALLY noticeable and can be quite distracting depending on the program or source. Blu-rays and DVD's don't give me the problem to the same degree as watching Direct TV. That said, at the end of the day, the screen size/image quality at this price point balances everything out and I'm satisfied with my purchase.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "For $784 you can't do any better than this TV", "Author": "A.J.", "ReviewID": "R286S70RXBGTFV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For $784 you can't do any better then this TV.  Free shipping, no interest financing and no tax.  Picture wise; in comparison to my previous Samsung TV (Plasma) for which I paid $1,200 3 years ago it's slightly better.  In comparison to other cheaper LCDs such as the Insignia from Best Buy this wins hands down. Blacks are actually black unlike on other cheaper LCDs where they appear to be gray.  The automatic \"real time\" brightness adjustment helps out too when the light changes.  I have this TV hooked up to my PS3 for Blu-Ray playback as well as gaming. Furthermore, I used the PC input to hook up my computer; I am extremely happy that, unlike my previous TV it maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio without stretching the screen (before I had to use DVI to HDMI to maintain the aspect ratio using up one of the HDMIs where now I can use the analog [VGA] and it works flawlessly).", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome tv", "Author": "Revealed In Obscurity", "ReviewID": "R26WWI089ROA9U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this tv yesterday from Fry's Electronics for 600 bucks. In store it looked amazing. Once I got home I immediately started watching an HD feed of a Lakers game which I had on my dvr box. I don't understand why people complain that 60 Hz is bad for sports when it looks just fine. Right now I'm watching the Pacquiao vs Mosley fight and it looks pretty good. Some HD feeds don't look that perfect and watching non HD feeds looks as if you're a watching youtube video, but that's not the tv's fault. My PS3 looks amazing on it. Movies on this thing, as opposed to other more expensive high end tv's, don't have that weird \"soap opera\" effect that looks as if they were filmed by amateurs with a camcorder.One thing I SHOULD note about this tv, is that it actually looks better when you're at an angle while watching it. I don't understand the science behind this, but nonetheless I'm pretty excited about this tv. Sure, LED tvs are leading the way now, but other that whiter whites and blacker blacks, I really don't see a difference in quality.HDTV's continue to evolve. 2 years ago this set probably would have cost 2 grand. I'm happy with the purchase and excited to see what the future brings with these tvs.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV!...not so helpful manual", "Author": "Gavin F", "ReviewID": "R1V8GZHPC1PQL4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd Samsung so I figured the same after market wall mount could be used on my new TV..but no.

It does not have built-in Internet apps but since you can purchase a wireless Blu-Ray playerSony BDP-S570 3D Blu-ray Disc Playerfor less than $150 with Wireless-N connectivity and internet apps this was not a big deal.

Tried to power it on and nothing shows on screen except a very very light blue tint.  Everything frozen.  Comcast remote, TV remote do not work.  TV is definitely on - the little red light is off as when power is on - but the only way to power it off is to unplug it from the electrical wall box.  Comcast even came here to make sure it was not a problem with the cable box when I knew it was the TV and not Comcast.  I unplugged and replugged everything numerous times and it still was/is frozen.  We registered this set online and in doing so; Samsung offers a additional three month to the warranty.  So, thankfully, it it still under Samsung warranty.  However, the bad part is that Samsung apparently doesn't have enough factory authorized service people in our area. and the technician can't be here until Dec. 1, 2011 (if even then due to work load).....Another complaint is that the woman from Samsung could find nothing on her system indicating that I had registered this set online for the three month additional warranty.  I had to look at my paperwork and find the confirmation letter they sent us when I registered it.  She also could not see the email Samsung sent us reminding us that the extended warranty would expire on Dec. 11, 2011.Needless to say - we are not happy.  BTW - this unit is only used for no more than 4-5 hrs. a day.

Started to flicker then eventually went dark. Common problem among the Samsung's of this series.  This same problem is described all over the internet. The repair tech that Samsung sent out wanted over $300 to replace the power supply.  Save yourself the headache and buy another brand. The Achilles heal of LCD series of this television was the power supply board.  It only lasted for one-two years before it would have to be replaced.  Replacement boards are now hard to find, because this was such a big problem.  Samsung chose to look the other way in the hopes that people would just buy a newer model after the one year warranty runs out.
