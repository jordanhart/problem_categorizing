{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good for the price you pay!", "Author": "ranjith", "ReviewID": "R3I6ZQ7CO9SRQ5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I decided to buy this TV, it was just as good as a gamble because I could not find many reviews online. I am glad that I went ahead and bought this TV because I feel that you cannot get anything better than this in the 200$ price range. I would go through the details of the TV, the brand and the things you have to know before buying this TV.Westinghouse TVs are said to be made by the Taiwanese LCD manufacturer Chimei which also makes LED/LCD panels for some other big players. It seems to have a good overall reputation. The package was basic and neat. It contained the TV, remote, AC/DC adapter, stand, power chord and the connecting screws. Setting it up took less than 5 minutes.The Picture and Sound qualities of this TV are really good for a basic LED TV. I wish the blacks were darker and clearer, the dark scenes are not as enjoyable as the bright ones. You can adjust the lighting in the room to fix this problem up to an extent.Update: The USB port is useless, it can be used only for servicing the TV!The connectivity options are pretty good too. This TV has a USB port even though I did not see that mentioned in any of the Tech Specs online. I did not check if it plays all video files as I use my Blu-Ray Player to connect the USB.Service and Warranty would be the deal breaker for Westinghouse TVs. If you face any problem with the TV, you will have to ship it back to their Texas facility to get a repair or replacement. This is rubbish as no one would want to spend 250$ to ship and get a 200$ TV repaired. Westinghouse should open service centers at least for each zone if they seriously want to stay ahead of the competition.To conclude, this TV is worth every penny you spend on it as long as you do not run into any troubles. If you do, it is going to be very difficult to get a repair or replacement unless you live in Texas :).Update: USB port is useless, it can be used only for servicing the TV per the manual.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice TV", "Author": "Weechella", "ReviewID": "R58TYY39BKN4H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Finally decided to upgrade from my old, monster Sony TV and I'm glad I did. The Westinghouse is just right for me.I'm not knowledgable about the fine points of picture and sound, but it does what it's supposed to and looks and sounds very good to me. Easy to set up right out of the box on my own (I'm a middle-aged female with good DIY skills).

One, the volume is always too loud.  Having it on 1 or 2 is a reasonable listening level, and it is unbearable after about 20 (of 100).  Two, given the LED nature, there are 'hot spots' on the screen where the backlights are.  They are very obvious when the screen is on and black, and can create an inconsistent viewing experience when watching dark sources.If you can overlook those two (relatively minor) flaws (I couldn't), this is a good TV for the price!", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "decent quality and super efficient!", "Author": "Joe Glines", "ReviewID": "R2O8NPF237J7OS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in June 2012 and use it everyday.  While on solid black I can see a little light coloring around the edges, it is negligible.  I was really into saving $ on electricity so I hooked it up to my power meeter and, on the power-saving setting, it was drawing about the same as a 30-watt bulb!
