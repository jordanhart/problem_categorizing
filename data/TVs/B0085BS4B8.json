I use it for my Xbox (With HDMI), netflix, Tv etc... The picture quality is absolutely amazing, remote is slim and functions, the TV is extremely light for added convenience , and includes most important jacks and hookups. At the end of every session of use, i simply cannot believe the TV is offered at this price. Another key feature i forgot to mention is the fact that this TV is LED. Meaning new technology, more sharp images and energy saving technology. The back states it only costs $9 to power this TV for a year, calculated with 5 hrs of use daily.

In other words, I'm not using an HD input. The picture is fantastic. The sound is great. The remote works well. If you are looking for an inexpensive TV that will give excellent performance, this is it.

Sullivan \"Live Life\"", "ReviewID": "R2LLUY9CL82TOW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this TV for an exercise room. I can't complain about the picture. It is fine. The sound is not so great as it is missing base. It really becomes apparent when you hear men talk. The TV does allow you to customize many things including the sound. I have the base all the way up 100% and the treble at 75%. This makes the sound passable. I believe some other people in their reviews said the sound was good, maybe they live in a high pitch world.The TV is easy to setup. The remote is a little funky. No menu button instead it is called Home. The buttons are on the small side. Would I get this again, I don't know. I would shop some more and maybe get something else, but I find TVs often have their quirks. I can live with the ones on this one for what I use it for.Update:After 3 months of little use the TV went kaput. Screen does not light up; no sound; blue bottom light is on all the time (does not turn red). I can unplug TV overnight, plug it back in, and the TV turns on like normal. Turn it off -blue light still on.  Try turning it on again- Screen does not light up; no sound; blue bottom light is on.I called customer service which went to a call center in India. Not to much problems just some problems understanding the person. I have now sent it to warranty $43 dollars shipping. Warranty goes to:Hyper Microsystems100 Lakeview ParkwayVernon, IL 60061So when considering whether to buy this TV factor in about 40 to 50 bucks and see if you can get a better and more reliable TV. Maybe more if you factor in hassle and down time.Save your box and packing material for the length of your warranty time on any TV you purchase that and is shipped to you. I had did and am glad for at least that.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": ":]", "Author": "Jamie B.", "ReviewID": "R11SGWCN6TBBKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really nice picture, I love the fact that you can hook up an USB to it.

This Proscan has a nice look, small footprint, and a decent 720p picture.  HOWEVER, as other customers commented, the built-in speakers leave very much to be desired.

I just bought the Coby 32\" one and it has a better picture although the resolution isn't as good (but on one this size it isn't a big deal) and it cost less. The picture seems to me to have the painted effect the early gen LCDs has for some of the 480p broadcasts.The input connections are awfully close together and getting the cable connected next to the audio in for the PC is a tight fit. Ditto with the VGA cable connector.The tuner doesn't work as well as other TVs I own and it has problems picking up the same over the air signal from the same antenna that the other TVs can grab.And the sound is terrible for a TV.
