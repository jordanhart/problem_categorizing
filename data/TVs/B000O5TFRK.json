{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's like I never watched TV before", "Author": "J. Rogers", "ReviewID": "RUTGJLFFDLHS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for 5 days now.  I've spent the majority of those days cruising around the HD Tier of my local cable company.  As far as the picture goes, it is simply beautiful.  I've done a massive amount of tinkering with the settings.  Not because I can't find the combination that I like, but because I just felt like playing around with it and comparing the different configurations.  Do yourself a favor and make sure the first thing that you do is change the mode from \"Vivid\" to something else.  \"Vivid\" is the factory default and most likely set that way to boost the attraction level for the showroom.I started out by just using the calibration settings from [...] for the TH-50PX60U:Picture Mode  StandardPicture  +22Brightness  +8Color  -1Tint  -4Sharpness  -14Color Temperature  WarmThese gave the picture a warmer, more realistic feel right off the bat.  Skin tones were much more realistic after calibrating to these settings.  The TH-50PX75U is, for all intents and purposes, the same TV as the TH-50PX60U from last year with the former having a few more features.I also decided to play around with the \"Custom\" mode and use the above settings as starting points.  I decided to stick with the above settings for the time being as I find them most pleasing to the eye.  Overall, the black levels look very good showing detail in the dark areas as well and the color is vivid.  The picture looks very crisp and you get that \"realism\" factor that I have really only felt while researching plasmas and LCDs.  Other technologies of HDTVs have not given me that \"realism\" feel.I've found that it is possible to notice the differences between the various cable channels and the HD that they utilize.  For instance, I was watching one of the NBA Conference Finals games on TNTHD and also flipping to a baseball game being broadcast on ESPNHD.  TNTHD broadcasts in 1080i while ESPNHD broadcasts in 720p.  I noticed that the ESPNHD baseball game was actually a tad more crisp and vibrant than the TNTHD basketball game broadcast.  However, I also noticed that the basketball game looked more crisp whenever the main camera that is used to pan the floor during the action was not used and the action cut away to another camera.  I was amazed that I could see the difference between the cameras being used within the same broadcast.  That being said, the game action was still more crisp than anything that I have ever seen on my old tube, non-HD set.  I think that I may have been able to assist this by tinkering with the settings a bit but it was far from an issue as it still looked great.  Also, while I flipped back and forth between the baseball and basketball games I also happened upon a live concert which looked even better than either the baseball or basketball game.  The detail was just stunning.Also of note is the fact that you will notice that live events (sporting events, concerts) look much better in HD than a movie that is being broadcast in HD.  The movies look very good and you won't be disappointed.  I'm just trying to establish what to expect as a general rule.I spent some time comparing the standard definition broadcasts versus the HD broadcast of the same events.  For instance, I flipped back and forth between the basketball game being broadcast on TNT between their standard definition digital signal and their HD channel.  If all you've ever known is non-HD TV you will not believe that you ever had to watch an event in standard definition when you do the flip-comparison.  The amount of detail that I was missing with my old TV was just incredible.I do not think that the standard definition channels are all that bad overall.  Some better than others but for the most part it is slightly better than what I had been used to watching on my old TV.  This, at least to me, is saying something being that this TV is 50\" versus my old 27\" non-HD TV.  I was expecting the fuzziness of standard definition channels to be exaggerated because of being spread out over a much larger screen.  I have also been using the \"Just\" aspect ratio when viewing standard definition channels which is like the \"Full\" aspect ratio except that it uses some sort of algorithm to make the center 1/3 of the picture appear without the appearance of being \"stretched\" and the outer 2/3 of the picture is stretched which seems to present a more normal presentation in lieu of being stretched.  I am doing this simply as a precautionary measure during the first couple of hundred hours of viewing to guard against image retention (burn-in).  I realize that the technology has come a long way in eliminating image retention but I would rather be cautious.There is no PIP with this unit.  However, this is not an issue for me as my HD/DVR cable box has the PIP feature which works just fine for what I will use it for.I do not currently have a lot of peripherals and don't ever plan on having much more than I have now.  I currently have my old DVD player (connected via component video), my XBox 360 (connected via component video) and my HD/DVR cable box (connected via HDMI).  That leaves me with one more HDMI port and no more component video connections along with the composite and S-Video connections.  I plan on getting an Upconverting DVD-Recorder that I will connect via the remaining HDMI connection thus freeing up one of my component video connections.  Other than that I am looking into some sort of Home Theater In A Box (HTIB) that I will be connecting to the setup.  I would have liked to have another HDMI connection for that purpose but I will manage.The built-in speakers are more than adequate for now and I really don't have any complaints about them.  Not overwhelming but they are fine until I can get a HTIB.The pedestal stand that comes with the TV seems quite sturdy and was very simple to assemble and connect to the TV.  Once on the stand the TV seems quite well balanced and it would take quite a shove for it to tip over.  Panasonic also provides you with a couple of bands that you can use to screw into the TV itself and then to the stand that you place the TV on if you are not planning on wall-mounting the set to make it a little more stable.  I prefer the stand/pedestal mounting personally.The TV is in a fairly well-lit room during the day and even though this particular model does not have the glare reducing shield that the next level up model has, I have not experienced any issues with glare.  This was a concern for me but I have been pleasantly surprised.The black bezel/casing looks infinitely better to me than the TH-50PX60U's silver.  It was a wise change by Panasonic for this year's model.The remote is simple yet very functional.  I like the larger buttons and everything is easy to find.  The menu system is sufficient although I still find myself exiting out of a sub-menu when I didn't want to from time to time.  This is probably more a result of getting familiar with the menu system than anything else.Overall, I could not be happier with this HDTV thus far.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "G.

In fact, we had to turn the brightness down a couple of notches.I'm not a techno geek so I can't tell you how many plugs of this type or that are on the thing. I can only tell you it was more than enough for our PVR & DVD/VCR to be connected and there are many more open jacks for other stuff.We have had this TV for 2 months, trouble free and know at least 2 friends that are saving their pennies to purchase their own. Only time will tell us how good this TV really is but I can promise you once you have watched this TV for a while, you will compare all other TV's to it.p.s.  For those who are wondering, a standard 4:3 TV size picture on this screen (maintain the same aspect ratio) is about 42\" when measured diagonally. I was always wondering about that and figured other people might too.**** Update ****We've had this unit for 6 months with ZERO problems and the \"wow factor\" lives on.

This TV has stunning styling and an even better picture. Menus are easy to navigate and setup is a cinch. I would recommend that the picture setting be changed from the factory default \"Vivid\" to \"Standard\". The Vivid setting enhances brightness and contrast. Standard setting will result in better detail and less susceptibility to burn-in, particularly in the first 200 hours of use. Plasma burn-in with quality TVs such as this is no more of a problem than burn-in with CRTs because of advancements in anti-burn-in technologies such as rotating pixels (check Panasonic's website for more detail).", "Date": "May 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great set - especially for the money.", "Author": "Vergereistheforce \"vergereistheforce\"", "ReviewID": "RG8E15NUCZXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been shopping for months and I am 100% happy with this set. I finally decided on a 50\" Panasonic. Originally I was waiting for their new 1080p 50\" plasma to show up in stores but I bought the 720p set instead. After doing many head to head comparisons between various 720p and 1080p sets I concluded that paying an extra $1200 for a 1080p set just wasn't worth the premium. When sitting more than 5 feet away from an HDTV set my eye cannot discern the resolution difference between 720 and 1080p.I'm connecting my set to an HTPC. It syncs perfectly with my Geforce video card. When using a PC, there would be a small benefit to having 1080p resolution because fonts might be a little sharper. Once again, a benefit not worth $1200 extra.At 50 inches this set offers the best bang for the buck. The only other plasma that typically gets rated higher than this one is the Pioneer but it costs $800+ more.", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "THIS is what HDTV is suppose to be!", "Author": "txtxyeha", "ReviewID": "R12MP9VWYOYPTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In November 2006 I went cheap and entered the world of HDTV with an Insignia 32-in., 720P, LCD screen from Best Buy along with upgrading to DirecTV's 1080i package. My first reaction was, \"This is nice\", but not as in \"niiiiiiccccce!\" Four months later the Insignia's screen starts to act-up, and that's when I say to myself, \"Let's do it right this time.\"My wife and I were watching some Hi-Def shows last night and couldn't keep from saying \"Wow!\" about every 20 minutes. Even with just relying on the TV's speakers it felt like we were there. Played around with the colors, brightness, etc, at that was easy enough with the on-screen interface. The couch is about 110\" from the TV, so the 50\" screen was a good size. Wouldn't want to go bigger, but glad we didn't get the 42\".Also glad I spent the extra $400 and got the 2007 model that's all black instead of the 2006 model that had silver trim. The Insignia had silver trim, so naturally I now equate silver trim to \"cheap\".Since I do not consider myself an audio/video aficionado, I didn't hesitate to spend money now on a 720p system instead of waiting or spending more on a 1080p system. I am a touch worried about screen burn-in, but if this can last beyond five years then I'll be very happy.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Panasonic & Plasma = The Best", "Author": "R.

Awesome quality, easy to operate and unbelievable picture. Currently have it hooked up to my DirecTV HD-DVR, and the HD channels are awesome, but the standard DTV channels also look very good for a flat screen. I'm using the settings that J. Rogers listed in his review of this TV, and find that they're awesome for DTV and HD-DVD.Standard was a huge concern, as the children watch kids channels that are in SD only. Paid a visit to CC and the salesman placed a Sammy 4661 LCD and this unit on a SD DTV channel; sold on plasma hands down. Then you add the improvements that Plasma has accomplished lately, coupled with Panny's reputation and it was an easy decision. Yes, LCD may be the latest craze, but talk to the LCD owners re: their viewing experience outside of HD-DVD and HD channels, and you'll find some are quite unhappy. Nice to have a balanced product, which at this time, I can find NO NEGATIVES to report.Update: Purchased the Toshiba A2 HD-DVD player from Amazon (includes 7 free HD-DVD's) plus an amazon initial price of $237. Awesome picture and for those waiting out the HD-DVD / BR format war, please note that a good quality HDMI upconverting player costs nearly the same as the lower end Toshiba HD-DVD A2.

If you want to avoid that - there is a zoom feature which will enlarge the picture so that it fits horizontally on you screen.. rest is up to you whether you want to see the top or bottom of the picture - but the zoom really puts lots of dots in the normal tranmission.Even wide screen movies - which are transmitted as 4:3 by stations will require zooming - otherwise you will end up with vertical bars to have 4:3 adjustment, plus the horizontal bars transmitted by TV stations. If you zoom them then the bars will disappear but the picture quality will be low.Now the good part - the DVD player (regular - old one) hooked it up via component cables and picture is awesome. Not even a single extra dot. You just have to configure your DVD player so that it knows you have 16:9 TV. you will have to probably buy only the movies which have \"widescreen\" written on them to make this TV completely useful.The normal transmission from CNN, HBO and local channels is fine and of decent quality if you watch it in normal 4:3 modes.Another thing.. I tried to configure the TV in the recommended settings by most gurus and the picture looked very dull and faint.. I then added more color/brightness to my screen as everybody has a different liking (that is why they gave the color setting.. right?)", "Date": "July 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "I Could Not Be Happier With My TH-50PX75U", "Author": "Dougie Fresh", "ReviewID": "RIZNOSA6TLN55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my TH-50PX75U for three weeks now and overall it's been a very positive experience full of excitement and no remorse.  I can't imagine wanting anything else for the combination of picture quality and price.I did a lot of research and had my heart set on a 46-47\" 1080p LCD.  I'd read a lot of bad things about plasma: burn-in, running hot, etc.  I also didn't want to spend the kind of money 1080p plasmas were demanding and I had to have 1080p.  As I researched the flat panels I heard more and more that at 50\" and sitting 10' away, the human eye cannot see the difference between 1080p and 720p.  I also found reviews like Consumer Reports, CNET, etc. giving better picture quality marks to plasma TVs.  When I finally went to various local electronics stores to see for myself I was amazed that the lower priced 720p plasmas looked as good if not better than the expensive 1080p LCDs.  Reviews of 720p plasmas all pointed squarely at the TH-50PX75U as head or near the head of the class.  When the right Cyber Monday sale came along and I pounced.  I haven't looked back.I want to first start with the excellent packaging that made it very easy to move into my house.  The box has handles at the bottom to make it easy for two people to carry.  For a very heavy and expensive piece of electronics this is a very thoughtful design.  Inside the box it's a minimum of waste and styrofoam.  No overpackaging here.Looking at the instructions, putting the TV on the stand look intimidating but it's very simple.  There are arrows on the stand and on the TV that make it easy for two people to line it up and set it on the stand.  Out of the box it connected right away via HDMI to my Comcast DVR and I was watching HD for the first time in my own home in less than an hour out of the box.  Following advice on the internet for the break in period, I went into the Picture menu and took the TV out of Vivid mode and into Custom mode where I am using the following settings during the break-in period:Picture: +12Brightness: +5Color: -2Tint: -5Sharpness: -3Color temp.: WarmColor mgmt.: OffVideo NR: OffMPEG NR: OffBlack level: LightWith these settings the picture looks a little dark but it's just amazing.  Panasonic actually recommends setting all these to 0 (50%) for the first 100 hours but that was intolerable.  Just be sure to fill the screen and not have any bars along the sides or tops for too long.  According to everything I've read burn-in is just not an issue but the break-in period will determine the life of the panel so it's best not to have it set too bright.Watching football is a completely new experience.  Not only is the detail amazing but seeing the whole field like this you see all you've been missing.  The TV itself is beautiful.  The shiny black bezel is very thin all around and the speakers are completely hidden.  The power-on indicator is an unassuming little red light in the lower left hand corner.  Red's probably not as cool as blue but I like it.  There are two HDMI ports in the back along with two component inputs and two composite/RCA/S-video inputs.  There is also an optical and RCA audio output on the back.  I tried using the optical out but it will not output Dolby 5.1.  You're better off going right from your STB or DVD player to your receiver with your optical/coax audio or better yet HDMI.The remote is suprisingly small and not at all about trying to be a universal remote.  This remote is for the TV.  There is a button that brings up the menu to switch between inputs so going from cable or TV to DVD is easy.  The inputs can be labelled or turned off if they aren't being used.  The only input that cannot be turned off is the TV input which is too bad if you're using it as a monitor like I am (and I suspect most people are) since I have HD over cable.  You can use the aspect button to cycle through 4:3, H-Fill, Just, Full and Zoom.  It will remember for the particular signal (SD or HD) what you last selected.  The sound from the speakers is pretty nice and once you adjust the bass and treble from the flat out-of-the-box settings it's even pretty nice to listen to music on while you are waiting for you HTIB to be delivered.  Changing the picture settings is very easy and there are a lot of choices.  There are no independent color settings in the user menus but lots of other things to fiddle with like those I illustrated above.I can't wait to hang it on my wall.  It's going to look like a picture.  I also can't wait until the HD DVD wars are over.  BBC's Planet Earth on Discovery HD Theater looks amazing in cable thru HD.  I can just imagine with less compression from a DVD it must be out of this world.  This TV makes me want a hi-def DVD player like you can't believe.  It also makes me not want to watch SD any more.  SD looks good but not great but what do you expect when you blow up what's a poor quality image to begin with.  You are going to blown away when you watch you favorite shows in HD for the first time.  I can't wait to see the Summer Olympics in HD in 2008.  Everyone is coming to my house for the NFL playoffs / Superbowl.  When is that HTIB going to get here?!Pictures of the back of the set can be found in the product manual on the Panasonic website.  For everything you want to know I highly recommend downloading the PDF from the Panasonic website.Nothing is perfect however so I have a couple of nits.  None of these are showstopper for me since I knew all about them except the last one going in.  If I could give 4.9 stars I would only deduct .10.- I would have liked a dedicated PC input.  I am relieved to hear however that most of today's HTPCs support 720p output and using one of the HDMI inputs is not an issue except that I am using them all.- I would have liked 3 HDMI inputs.  I already have my Comcast DVR and a DVD player hooked into the HDMI inputs.  That means only analog inputs are left available.- Screen glare is kind of annoying when I notice it but once there's something on TV I find I stop noticing it and forget all about it.  It will be better once we take the Christmas tree down and there isn't anything flashing on and off behind me :-).  I am convinced the glass front is one of the reasons the picture is so good.  It's not hidden behind tinted plastic like an LCD.  You pick your poison.- When the screen shows black and white (like credits) I see a rainbow effect -- like a yellow and blue flash if I move my eyes.  My wife doesn't see this effect but I see it and it's annoying.  Others have reported it on the internet so it's worth trying out in the store to see if it's tolerable for you.  This would be my .10 deduction.I am more than convinced this TV was the right choice over the Philips 47\" 1080p LCD I was sure I was getting until I saw this TV.  Not that the Philips wasn't nice but the Panasonic was just in the next tier above.  If you can find a good deal (sub-1500$USD) pounce on this TV.

Jones", "ReviewID": "R3KUJEHT7PMUU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is my initial opinion of this TV, which I've had for only a short while.PictureAfter adjusting the settings a bit, I was pleased with the picture. SD looked decent, and HD looked good. The blacks are very good, almost CRT like, and the brightness is fine, even it a well lit room. The white can seem dull sometimes, but I've only ever noticed it during some commercials with white backgrounds. For regular TV and movie watching, the white level seems great. Where this TV really seems to shine is its color. I am extremely impressed with how lifelike its colors are, especially in HD. The picture seems more realistic, compared to other models I had looked at.At first, I did feel that I was missing a little bit of depth, compared to other TV's that I had considered, but I was happy overall. The picture looked good, but it didn't have the \"wow factor\" that I had hoped. Well, as a few days went by, my concerns began to slip away. The picture just seems to get better and better. I'm now seeing that depth I was missing before. HD looks amazing and SD looks pretty darn good.Also, I have not experienced any image retention, screen door effect, or \"burn in\" what-so-ever, and believe me, I've been looking for it. I was also originally concerned that I would miss out on the best possible picture with only a 720P set, but I didn't think that 1080P is worth the extra premium for my situation, and I still feel that way.SoundI was expecting small plastic sounding speakers, but what I got was rather impressive sound from this set. It's not quite as good as the sound from the PZ700U, but is more than adequate for watching TV shows and movies.Features/OptionsThis TV has basic inputs and options. Nothing fancy, but very functional. It would be nice to have another HDMI and a PC input. A swivel stand would also be nice. The remote is very basic, nice big buttons, but the button locations take a bit of getting used to. There are a good number of picture adjustments, but an auto adjustment would be nice for inexperienced users.Build QualityThe TV itself seems well built. Its hefty, and feels like a well built piece. Connections all feel solid, and the casing feels strong as well. The stand is sturdy, and weights quite a bit too. The remote is decent, but I've seen nicer. Not a big deal since I will be using the cable box remote anyway.My GradingPicture: ASound: B+Options/Features: C+Build Quality: AValue: A+Overall: AI am very impressed with this TV.

I had researched the box size online before I bought, and researched the cargo space dimensions of my wife's Prius.  When I saw the box at the store, my faith in my research wavered.  My wife and the guy helping use were very skeptical.  The box slipped right into the cargo bay, and the rear hatch closed with no trouble at all.  Math and research trump gut feelings.Getting the box into the house and installing was a snap.  My son installed the pylons on the mounting base, and he got them backwards.  It is possible.  He's one of those who refuses to read instructions.  It would be handy if Panasonic designed the mounts to prevent reverse installation, but in reality, I cannot blame Panasonic.  Once my son installed the pylons correctly, the panel mounted on the base perfectly.I connected the Component Video cables and a pair of plain old RCA type audio cables from my DVD.  Connected the Cable TV connector to the DVD Recorder, and powered on my new TV.I was watching poor quality cable immediately after going through initial setup of the TV.  We get the most basic analog cable package.  Then I popped in LOTR:Fellowship of the Rings for my first real test.  My DVD is  standard def, but the image was excellent, and audio was good.  I'll hook up my wife's Onkyo surround sound system this weekend, then we'll be having some really good sound.The only minor fly in the ointment is our Infrared headphones.  We keep them around for my Dad who does not hear so well.  The TV must be putting out some serious infrared noise.  The headphones are completely useless.  When I take the headphones around to the side of the TV, the sound is fine.  Anywhere you can actually see the television picture, the headphones are washed out with some sort of static.  It could be that the Panasonic syncs with other devices via infrared, or it could be the plasma display pumps out noise in the IR range.  A quick Google will settle that in a few minutes.So far I will give this TV a high rating.  I can't fault Panasonic because I cannot use IR headphones.

I decided to call them with a few specific questions.  Customer Service was knowledgeable, courteous, and \"human\".  And to top it off we received our order about 3 days sooner than expected.  A+ for them.No doubt this is a quality product.  Other reviewers have thoroughly described the fantastic picture quality, etc.  An interesting observation I've made about our set is with regards to heat.  There isn't any!  I have the set in an armoir with a tight 3/8\" clearance on the sides and about 3\" on top.  The back of the armoir has a large hole cut to accomodate a CRT, but it is only about 1\" out from the wall.  After 6 hours of continuous viewing the set was still cool to the touch everywhere but a small vent on top in the back, and that part was only slightly warm to the touch.  This thing runs a lot cooler than my old CRT!  Definitely not what I expected from a plasma set.By the way, if you're looking at a \"brick and mortor\" store and comparing this TV with others, you may be disappointed or it may look fantastic.  All I can say is it is absurdly easy to manipulate the quality of the feed going to the various floor models.  Virtually every electronics store out there can and will use this technique to move the merchandise with the best incentives.

Unless you just have to keep up with the Jones, all you really need is 720P.  Use your money to go bigger.  Blueray is the only source that truly takes advantage of 1080P.  Add in the cost of the moves, it is not worth it.2. No matter what make and model you read about, someone, somewhere has written a bad review of it.  You will go crazy looking for a TV that everyone agrees is a good buy.With that said; I finally came to my senses and went to Consumer Reports.com for good advice.  The Panasonic TH-50PX75U received the CR Best Buy award.  I've had good luck with other Panasonic products so the answer was clear.I couldn't be happier with the decision.

The order arrived at my home via Amazon's shippers (Eagle USA), and the delivery men were courteous and helpful, removing the tv from the box and taking packaging away.Setting up the tv with HDMI cables was a snap, (tip: buy the \"Cables To Go\" high velocity cables from Amazon, they were a fraction of the price and the quality is superb), the instructions were clear and concise and my jaw was appropriately dropping within about twenty minutes of starting to make the connections.The picture quality and clarity is breath taking particularly after playing with the colour settings which is by and large very easy to do, the remote is somewhat basic, but does the job and the on screen menu is easy to navigate, to make the settings your own. I didn't bother with the sound, so I can't vouch how good or otherwise it is, as I connected it to a Home theater system.In short, for the price I paid (a little over $1400), this tv is everything I wanted and more. If it is within your budget buy a home theater system with an upconverting DVD player and surround sound, to not do so would be like buying a turbo charged car, and not bothering connecting the turbo charge, something would be missing.I would throughly recommend this product.", "Date": "February 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Panny TH-50PX75U 6 month review", "Author": "tntshuffle", "ReviewID": "R2BZ8J4HTLDOHU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got to tell you, I was skeptical at first because I'm more of a Sony guy.

I connected it to DirectTV yesterday...just watched Star Wars Episode 1 broadcast in HD...amazing...picture was so good I almost actually liked Jar-Jar.I investigated HDTVs thoroughly before buying- here's how I picked this one.(1) Plasma vs. LCD. In this price range, the picture's better on plasma TVs, hands-down. LCDs are brighter and have more contrast, but that comes with a big sacrifice in terms of the amount of details visible in the image. The image is more lifelike and shows more detail on the plasma displays. Burn-in and screen life are much less of a concern with today's plasmas and should really no longer be used as a reason to go LCD.(2) Panasonic. The only plasma TVs with better images than Panasonic are the Pioneers, but those are way too expensive. The image just looks better than other plasmas...deeper blacks, more realistic colors, more details visible.(3) 720p. This was the toughest decision. I was really on the fence between 1080p and 720p. 1080p is obviously the higher resolution, and in this line-up the 1080p TVs have a 30,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio as opposed to the 15,000:1 for the 720p. However, these are just specs on paper; the HD channels only broadcast in 1080i or 720 p anyway, so it doesn't make a difference when watching TV. I haven't bought a blu-ray player yet and probably won't until the prices come down some more...so there's no advantage for me yet in DVDs. Finally, in reality, I am sitting about 8-9 feet away from the TV in my living room...at that distance, the difference between 720p and 1080p is not really noticeable anyway...even you have Blu-ray. So given these factors, I went with 720p because the cost difference was about $500.Some people have complained about the reflection/glare on the screen on this TV. At night (when I watch TV), there's not much reflection when the TV is on (I watch in cinema mode)- in dark parts of the screen you can sometimes get a bit of reflection, but it's not any different than that what you get with a regular CRT TV, and it doesn't detract from the viewing experience.I ordered from Amazon- the TV was shipped and arrived right on time. Spent this weekend watching...the HD channels look great on the 50 inch display. I also bought an HDMI-DVI cable and was able to very easily hook up my laptop to the TV- used the laptop to watch DVDs, and even Youtube looked good at 50 inches!

I really like Sony, and think highly of their products. My upconvert DVD player is a Sony as is my surround sound system. But on a leap of faith and in part due to the overwhelming glowing reviews on the Panasonic, I decided to \"go pan\" for the first time in my life.I have to say the picture, viewing angle and black discrimination is the best on a plasma. I used the settings that I found posted by a fellow Amazoner below and fired her up. (I was very paranoid about burn in)After week one I did notice 'image retention\" of the TNT symbol, during a NASCAR race. Luckly it faded away @ 36 hours later.Then after having the TV for my second week, I had a 2-3 inch band of red from top to bottom of the screen. One day later a 2-3 inch band of blue was adjacent to the red, again from top to bottom.I called customer service, and they told me there was something obviously wrong with the TV.So I retunred it.  I ended up going back to Sony, getting a 55 inch DKF-55E2000, for almost a $1000 less than the 50 inch plasma, and could not be happier. The viewing angles are perfect in our family room, and this is the ultimate TV for watching sporting events.I agree that rear projections do not handle the blacks as well as plasma. My Sony is good, but the Pan. was great in that regard.However, I feel plasma TVs are a little bit like a Porsche. They are great when they run, but are just a bit finicky.For me, I just want to watch my sports with out worrying about burn in, etc. Granted I will need to keep an extra XL2400 bulb on hand :-)I wish the plasma would have worked out for me, but it didn't.
