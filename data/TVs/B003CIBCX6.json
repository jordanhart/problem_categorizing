{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far so good (Update, still great after 10 months!)", "Author": "Kelly Daniels \"shadeybeep\"", "ReviewID": "R3AAQF0QUGPMKI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this a few weeks ago, and so far it's met all of my expectations.First of all -- things that I had trouble finding out in advance:  There is a headphone jack on the side, which can be used as an analog audio out (I'm pretty sure it came with a cable even -- 3.5mm to audio RCA connector) -- in addition to the optical digital audio out which is on the back.  I haven't tested this yet, so I couldn't say if there is an actual difference in sound quality between either of the sources.  I also don't know if it can output sound through both at the same time.Also, although the stand and \"frame\" are glossy, the actual screen has a matte anti-glare coating which I find works very well.As a TV:  It looks great! I have it hooked up through component cables to my comcast dvr .. no issues at all.  Plugged it in, and it just worked.  The default display setting for some reason was the \"vivid\" color profile..  I played around with settings a bit, but I decided I like the vivid profile the best anyway.One feature that I really like is that it can be set to adjust the aspect ratio automatically based on the programming.  So when I switch to non-HD channels the aspect automatically adjusts, so I don't have to see any stretched faces.  I don't have to ever press the aspect button to change it.  Of course if you prefer to set it manually, it lets you do that too.As a computer monitor:  I'm currently using DVI.  It looked great when I first plugged it in.  Some of this might be my video card, but it automatically selected the best resolution, etc.  It was possibly a little too blue-ish for my taste (probably only because I have it right next to a gateway lcd which is a little brighter and has more \"warm\" tones, which I prefer -- if the second monitor wasn't sitting right next to it, I think I'd have gotten used to it immediately).  I adjusted the display settings, which helped a bit, and then adjusted the video card settings which helped a lot more. The second I told windows to use my video card color/video settings rather than windows, it looks PERFECT.  I also adjusted the gamma on the monitor, I like my display to be very bright.I can't comment on the sound (my dvr and computer's audio goes directly to my receiver), or the remote (I use a logitech harmony, it was very easy to set up).  I also can't comment on the built in hdtv tuner, I never hooked up an antenna or cable line directly to the tv, and it won't pick up any channels without one or the other.The only con that I can think of right now is the fact that there are no dedicated buttons for changing the input mode. You have to scroll through them -- although with the exception of the TV input (coaxial) it will not select sources that are not plugged in, which is nice.  I would have liked if it wouldn't select \"TV\" unless I had something plugged in to that input, but it's not that big of a deal.Oddly, even though there aren't any dedicated input buttons, my harmony remote was still somehow able to get it to switch directly to component from any other input..  This did not work with any of the other input sources though, just component.  Maybe there is a hidden functionality in there somewhere, though.. I might look into it one day.Oh, it also takes a little longer than I would like to \"wake up\" but I am very impatient in general, this might not bother most people.Anyway, I think this is a great monitor and a great tv, and I am VERY happy with my purchase!  I just wish I'd been able to afford the 27\" instead!EDIT 11/08/11:I still am loving this monitor.  Since my original review, I've added a PS3 to my setup using the HDMI connector, and used the optical digital audio out on the monitor to my receiver -- sound and video are both perfect.Also, in addition to getting my harmony remote to select component input without cycling through, it was also able to directly select the A/V input (I believe that's composite).. although, I currently have nothing plugged into that one.  Still, might be important information for other people.  I have yet to figure out any way to get the monitor to directly select any input other than component and A/V.  If I could I would upgrade my rating, since the time it takes to cycle through inputs is the only thing keeping me from considering this a 5 star monitor.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "As advertised!", "Author": "WillyD", "ReviewID": "R1G7GFDXJVN8IQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's rare when you make a purchase of a quality product, at a great price, free shipping, smooth delivery!

Ok Sound", "Author": "Jeri Zerr \"formerly a Road Warrior of the Nth...", "ReviewID": "RL6D960V2TSM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this LG HDTV to be used primarily as a monitor due to the larger screen, secondary to watch tv and videos on the widescreen display.We like the fact AAA batteries included for the remote as well as the DB-15 cable to connect to the computer AND the audio cable (mini stereo on both ends) to connect the \"monitors speakers\" to the computer.  We're running the Gigabyte ATI Radeon HD4350 512 MB PCI-Express Video Card GV-R435OC-512I for an excellent display! We are using the 15 pin output from the video card to this LG HDTV as a monitor and the HDMI output to a 46\" Philips LCD HDTV for presentation purposes. This is a good combination for anyone wanting to display HD on their home theater and use the PC-15 pin for the tv being used as a monitor.Update: We've been using this TV as a monitor for several months now. The picture is GREAT! The sound is quite suitable for watching movies. We are audiophiles so we feel the sound could be \"better\" but it's perfectly fine for the average user hence we've upgraded the review from 4 star to 5 star. Kudo's to LG for another GREAT product at an excellent price point. Even months later this unit is still the best priced unit currently on the market when factoring in the features and quality. When we were recently looking around for a replacement computer monitor (another Acerview monitor bit the dust) we again found this HDTV to be such a good value we ordered a second unit.

Very sharp picture with true color, easy on the eyes, good sound. Wide angle of view with little color changes (as many LCD TVs tend to have).

It was well worth it. Has a hookup for anything an everything. Tv tuner and built in speakers, along with hook-ups, were the selling point for me. The tv tuner needs to be in an amazing reception spot to work on it's own, despite what everyone else says if you look IN THE MANUAL, it suggests to use the antenna to get the channels to work. That's common sence. Otherwise I don't notice any bleeding(only on Fallout 3) so that's not a worry. Makes my Blu-Ray movies look better then on the HDTV in the living room.

DVD movies and TV content from cable service had noticible graininess and blurry edges, especially with text.  Second, the day after I ordered it, I noticed that Amazon had reduced the selling price by $50 (from 269 to 219), but Amazon would not honor a price-matching reduction because this item is considered a computer electronics item (a \"TV Monitor\") not a \"TV\".  Worth looking at Amazon's price matching policies and exactly how they classify an particular \"TV\" before you buy one of these gizmos from them; basically they seem to only honor price matching for TV's.  I thought I was purchasing a TV.  Needless to say, this unit went back to Amazon the day after it arrived for a full refund (I presume/hope), and I've subsequently purchased a \"real\" TV (LG 22LE5300).", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Looks really good, great picture.", "Author": "Rich Hampton", "ReviewID": "R1V9KJNU21S5JZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am using this TV Monitor on my kitchen counter under the cabinet. Perfect size, don't have to squint. The picture is very clear. Would like to see a picture freeze button to read the fine print of some adds. While watching some stations there is a 1 second delay between the sound and the movement of lips of the speaker. Haven't figured out weather the issue is caused by the monitor or the cable company.

I returned this set for use as anything. It may be just ok as a computer monitor but as a TV it is useless. The reasons (1) it is designed to be viewed head on. If viewed from below (as if on wall) everything fades to dark. Viewed from the side produces similar but not as dark results. Best used right in front of your nose. (2) The speakers are on the back of the set and the audio amplifier is very low powered. There is no headphone jack so the only external amp you can use has to be digital. (3) The TV tuner has be minimal. The picture was noisy, even using the noise reduction settings. I even tried a video amp but could never get a completely noise free picture. (4) The color is washed out and even trying to adjust the settings never gave me a vivid picture.My recommendation...not useful even as a computer monitor.
