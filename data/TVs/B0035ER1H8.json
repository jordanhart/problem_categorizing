My previous LCD was a Samsung 32\" 720p - and this set blows it away in almost every aspect.  I think I paid around $550 for the Samsung a little over a year ago, so I jumped at the chance to upgrade to the EX400.Pros:  The ambient light sensor works terrific.-  4 HDMI inputs!  Plug away my friends.-  Bravia Sync feature works great with my Sony home theater system.-  PS3 games have never looked better.  I played Killzone 2 right after I setup the TV and my jaw was open for about 10 minutes straight.-  It only has a 60Hz refresh rate, but I've yet to see any blur while watching sports.-  DVD's look fairly crisp as well, considering I have a cheap DVD up-converter.-  It's a Sony!  I'm sure some ppl have had bad experiences with Sony, but I've had nothing but luck.  To each his own I guess.Cons:  The remote is junk.  It looks cheap and it isn't very functional.-  The grey panel on the front.  I had a bigger problem with the online picture of the set than I do in person.  It doesn't look THAT bad - but it still throws off the continuity of the black perimeter.  Strange call by Sony.-  Calibration is frustrating.  There are so many different picture settings you'll probably struggle to find the perfect setup.  I used the DVD THX Optimizer (found it on one of my Star Wars movies) and it helped a lot.  (I posted them on [...])-  If you're using an antenna instead of cable/satellite you'll find that channel surfing is a bit slow.  This is kind of a nitpick, but the channels take a little longer to load on this set.-  No swivel?  I knew this set didn't have it before I bought it - but it would still be nice.For around $600 you can have full 1080p AND a 40\" screen.  Great TV - great deal.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "BAM", "ReviewID": "R1M4NLILPMEU1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy.  Sharp picture. Easy to use.  Not an electronic-phile but I do my homework and was hesitant to buy a Sony.  From what I read Sony was living on its laurels.  But this TV seems to give great bang for the buck (and my wife wanted a Sony).  I do not miss 120HZ or LED.  The picture is not blurry when watching sports or action movies to my eye or anyone else in my family (of course all we watch is curling) (just kidding). Picture is bright, too.  Easy set-up.  It has a pre-set for home (rather than store), which has been fine by all of us.  $599 for 40\" 1080p.  Pretty Sweet.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simply a fantastic TV", "Author": "Justin T. Melanson \"Sun Quan\"", "ReviewID": "R1VHIAEP4XSS7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took me three months to pay for this, actually had it on layaway at my local Sears for that long. Originally I was going to go for two others TVs before this one until a gentleman who works there, went by the name of Peter, directed me towards this TV. As soon as I saw it, and saw the picture clarity in comparison to the Sharp Aquos as well as other TVs of similar size and specs, I knew this was the TV for me. Most of the other TVs looked washed out compared to this thing, so it was no contest.Anyway, I finally got this thing home, eventually set it up on a wall mount I got off of here for cheap, and it's been a fantastic TV. Much, MUCH improved over my old standard-def TV, which was given to a friend afterward BTW. The picture quality is superb, the colours are rich and vibrant, no motion blur, no slowdown, no lag, none of the problems that apparently seems to plague most TVs with the 60Hz specs. Even standard-def cable looks fantastic on this beast, and that's saying something right there. I don't think you'll be disappointed with this as a sports game TV at all if you want to primarily use it for that. However, the real star of the show is gaming. Especially with HDMI cables, which is a must, fortunately you can get them for crazy cheap nowadays.As one other reviewer said, games have never looked better. Like him, I sat there for at least 5 - 10 minutes drooling after booting up Killzone 2 on my PS3. I was absolutely amazed at how good everything looked, and that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Being able to read the text on Star Ocean: The Last Hope International and not having everything blur on me or having my eyes hurt for that matter, when using the classic Anime look of that game was astounding to say the least. Super Street Fighter IV, which is fast and frantic, ran without missing a single beat. Then there was Forza Motorsport 3 on the 360? Jaw-dropping to say the least. Same with Mass Effect, was amazing to see the text on screen whereas before I simply could not do so only downer was the slowdown but I feel that was due to in-game programming as opposed to my TV as the slowdown has only happened with this game alone. While I am sure other HDTVs would do the same thing, could they do so with the same quality? I can answer with doubtful.The only weak point is the sound, which is decent enough, it gets the job done but nothing more. There's nothing special about it, I'd say if you can, hook it up to a good surround sound speaker system. You'll most likely get better sound quality, and you'll be able to enjoy the fantastic picture quality this badboy has to offer. All in all, this is really a fantastic TV with so much bang for the buck that it's unreal. You won't be disappointed if you decide to get this badboy. I am so glad I did, I could not be happier as a gamer.An Update: I have had this TV for just about 2 years now, and I have to say I am still amazed by everything. I've not had any problems with the thing whatsoever. I still can't get over how many connections this thing has, alot of them are being used on it as we speak. I've even hooked up my PS2 through component cable, and my God I see what I was missing throughout all the years now. When even your older games that support Progressive Scan can look amazing on a nice TV such as this, you KNOW you've done something right.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "An outstanding set, especially for TV viewers and gamers", "Author": "J. Johnston", "ReviewID": "R2UV4B23T7TWKG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony has long been one of the better TV makers, going back to the Trinitron and later the WEGA.  The Bravia series has remained high quality machines, boasting great pictures, not to mention some of the lowest repair rates in the industry.  The 40EX400 lives up to that billing, sporting a terrific picture and some solid features at an astonishingly low price.It's tough cutting through a lot of the mire -- LCD vs. LED vs. plasma, 60Hz vs. 120Hz -- but this TV will prove to be more than adequate for the vast majority of owners.  The LCD image is eye-popping, with good contrast and vibrant images.  (While there is no substitute for professional calibration, drawing from the calibration settings available from reviewers here and elsewhere will yield really rich color.)  The screen diffuses glare very well, unlike the glass screens on some plasmas, so it is a good TV for those who deal with a lot of light.Some people are liable to wonder if they should go for this 60Hz or \"upgrade\" to 120Hz, but for most functions this TV works just as well, and for a lot less cost.  For one, virtually all TV (including sports) and video games both refresh at 30 or 60 frames per second, which is perfect for this TV, since 60Hz equates to 60 refreshes per second.  Football and baseball alike look great on this TV, and video games run like silk.  Gamers will also appreciate the brisk input response time, which makes playing first person shooters and other action games very satisfying; Sony clearly wanted to make sure their PS3 crowd would be at home in front of this TV.  The one Achilles Heel of 60Hz TVs - 24fps Blu-ray movies - still run well on this set thanks to the Cinemotion \"pulldown\" technique, and only the most visually trained will notice any motion stutter.The TV has a few other features worth noting.  The system boasts a generous collection of inputs, including 4 HDMI inputs and a USB port for playing music and movies.  The digital tuner works quite well, pulling in HD programming over the air with no trouble and even displaying the resolution of each channel.  (It actually did better in this way than the vaunted Zenith DTT901 Digital TV Tuner Converter Box.)  The calibration menus are very specific and allow for a lot of adjustments and customization, even allowing for different configurations across inputs.Of course, no TV is perfect, and this one has a few drawbacks.  There is no online connectivity, unlike a lot of other TVs out there today.  The digital antenna tuner pulls signals fine and will offer descriptions of current programming, but it has no functionality to display upcoming programming, something even cheap digital converter boxes do.  The sound is adequate but not extraordinary, although I wager most buyers will attach the set to a stereo or surround system.  Last but not least is the infamous grey bar along the bottom of the TV paneling; to be honest, I hardly notice it anymore and it's not as bad in person as it might seem, but some may still question Sony's tastes and prefer a more unified black look.Those nitpicks aside, it's really hard not to like this TV: at the time of this review the set goes for a little over six hundred bucks, which is extraordinary considering what a TV of these specs would have gone for just a few years back.  It's not a top-end TV but it's a darn good one and for the vast majority of viewers, especially if they care less about the particularities of Blu-ray and more about TV/cable/satellite and video gaming.  Highly recommended.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable Set", "Author": "Daniel A.

The picture clarity is breathtaking (I'm connected here in NYC to TimeWarner Cable's HD cable and I have an Xbox360, Playstation3 and Sony 5.1 surround Home Theatre kit all connected via HDMI - effortlessly).From the box to my wall this TV took all of 15 minutes to set up.  It was that easy.  There isn't a lot of tweeking of the picture, which is just fine with me!The best part was the price I got from BestBuy.  $575 (sale price $630 less $55 in coupons via their Reward Zone program).  At this price, the choice was basically made for me.

In general, I enjoy it (I mean: I have to enjoy sicne I paid 600 bucks). As I say in the title, I like the picture quality. But there are several cons that I must mention which annoy me quite a bit while watching TV:1) the software/menu/settings design is user-unfriendly as someone else also mentioned;2) there is no headphone output;3) another thing that annoys me a lot is the time that it takes way too long to switch from one channel to the other;4) the last and the most important con, i believe, is the extent of light reflection when the TV is put against light source (e.g., window).In general, I believe this is a good TV for those who can deal with the aformentioned annoyances, because the picture quality is excellent. But for a TV brand with strong reputation, these cons shouldn't have been there to begin with.Best of the luck for the potential buyers!", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture, average speakers", "Author": "JustSomeGuy", "ReviewID": "RD08OO8W7PP8T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had planned on getting a 32\" tv for my bedroom, but when I did some research, it was just an $80 upgrade to a 40\" tv.  So I opted for the larger picture and am glad that I did.  My last 40\" tv was a bravia W series I got three years ago at twice the price!  The picture appears the same to me on both televisions...beautiful.  When I got it home and installed in the bedroom, however, I was disappointed by how hollow the sound was coming from the television.  I tried the minimal settings to adjust it, but couldn't find one better.  The problem may be that the speakers are on the bottom of the frame, so the sound is shooting down instead of forward.  So I swapped it with the living room television which has better speakers that are facing forward.  So now this television is hooked up to external speakers in the living room and I am very happy with it.  It has a really nice power save feature which turns the television off after no activity from the remote for a set amount of time.  4 HDMI outputs are great.  The PC interface is odd, however, for a mac computer.  It has a VGA port in place of an HDMI port and only a female audio headphone jack input.  A double male headphone jack cord is a hard cable to find.  RCA inputs would have been nicer.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not bad: FAR from great", "Author": "Peter Kokemueller \"LCDTVZSERIES\"", "ReviewID": "R2O40QU2W3LIMV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV since March 2010. It has been replaced once already by SONY under warranty replacement. I will give SONY proper credit, they replaced the old (read - broken) TV within 10 days with a brand new unit. The old one started to FREEZE and eventually would not turn on or off either using the remote or the onboard power switch. The software/user interface/programming on this TV is total crap; shoddy at best. SONY can do alot better job than this but they rushed this unit into production. The remote is cheap and feels cheap in your hands. My biggest beef is the sound quality - or lack thereof. If you do get this TV, you might as well order a surround sound system at the same time because you will not be happy with the sound from the onboard speakers. If I had to do it over again, I WOULD NOT buy this TV, but I could not tell you which I would choose.

Kadash \"Rich\"", "ReviewID": "R2JBQ4OVTGS1J6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have this TV now for about 1 month and am so far pleased with the purchase.  This TV replaced a 42\" plasma EDTV.  This TV went into a bedroom with a 8 foot viewing distance.  I would reccommend a larger set if your distance is greater than 8 feet.  When I first got the TV home I mounted it to the provided TV Stand, but then ordered on Amazon a $30 tilting wall mount for it.  This TV without the stand is very lightweight.  I did match this with a Sony Blu Ray Player, and SOny 5.1 HDMI 1000 watt sound system.  Note that when matching to other Sony products the other products are instantly recognized by the TV.  For example, when I turn the TV on and then insert a disk in the Blu Ray player on the TV the mode is automatically switched to BD to view the movie.  Note that 2 HDMI inputs are on the side of the unit, and 2 in the back.  I also connected an XBox 360 to the TV and been having great performance with it.  Note that the non-illuminated remote is a little un-intuitive/ergonomic to use.  The mute button is very small, and I also have problems with the black dial you need to use for menu program operations. Also note that the TV sound is not very loud, but, since I am using a thousand watt sound system I can get the missing volume any time I want.  The high definition viewing (720 I/P, 1080 I/P) is very good.  Standard definition is problematic when viewing standard TV stations.  Colors sometimes can be blotchy, and overall a little out of focus.  But you can't blame that on the TV because when you switch to the HD TV Station and it's crystal clear!  I experimented placing this TV in my living room but opted for a larger 47\" lcd tv there instead.  That is why I suggest not using it where your distance is greater than 8 feet.

It takes almost a minute after pushing the \"on\" button before there is anything on the screen, and then a \"Sony\" logo appears which stays on-screen for almost another minute, during which time you cannot select a channel. Once there is finally a picture on the screen, three black bars appear, each about 2\" wide, which stretch all the way across the top of the screen. The top bar contans information on the program name, the network and the cable channel; the second bar contains a program description (if there is one, or a note if there isn't); the final bar contains the NTSC channel. These three bars, which cut off the heads of anyone appearing on screen, stay on the screen for almost another minute. The same delay with the bars occurs every time you change the channel.The remote is not good, but I've seen worse. The \"jump\" button doesn't always work; it often skips channels. And then, of course, even though you might have wanted to check the other channel for just a moment, there is that delay before the black bars go away and you can actually see a full picture on the screen. There is a circular selection knob (similar to cell-phones), and you must push on right-left-top-bottom to move the cursor, then push the center to make your selection. You must either have small fingers or a stylus to use it.The on-screen menu is a disaster! You must step through several subordinate menus to make even minor changes. It is not at all intuitive or user-friendly.The bottom line is that although the picture is OK once you actually get one on the screen, I would not have bought this set if I had known about these annoyances.  I have other sets in the house which do not exhibit any of the Sony's faults.

I was upset that now i had a pukey colour tv  and i was getting nothing but a run around.  They told me i had to send it in to get it fixed  as long as i  had the  Original receipt.  They sent me to a link  that said i would be able to get a BACKUP tv until they fixed it. I just needed to fill out the form. which I DID!The original receipt was faded so they  were going to charge me full cost of fixing the set.

I am somewhat embarrassed to say anything negative so please don't allow my comments to stop you from buying this model.  The picture quality is amazing.  I can find 3 slight problems, one of which I resolved.  That is, the sound during when the \"sports scene\" is selected, amplifies the ambient sounds (the crowd noise, the crack of a bat) so much so that the announcers are difficult to hear.  However, in the menu, it is easy to turn off those sounds so you get an incredible picture with normal sound.  Also, for someone like me who has ADD, I use the DirectTV Guide while still watching a program.  Normally, I can see the program and hear it while looking at the Guide.  With this TV, the voices are extremely distorted.  And finally, the controls, like changing channels, using DirectTV List, etc. do not function for about the first 30 sections when the TV is turned on.  This may be an energy saving element as the TV has an Energy Star rating.

I had a pretty strict budget, but I wanted a TV that I would not constantly be desiring to replace.  After a while it came down between this and the Panasonic TC-P42S2 plasma.  Since I live in pretty high elevation in Colorado Springs (over a mile high), it would be safer to go with LCD.  I bought this TV for $624.04 price matching with Ultimate Electronics at Best Buy.  Set-up was quite easy (I used CNET calibration settings, the only thing I boosted was color).  The TV looked fantastic!  Clarity was astounding and colors were quite vibrant (It seemed at the time).  No comment on the sound (I have surround sound), but I wouldn't expect much.  After watching for a bit I did notice some motion blur (Quite common in LCD's, can be lightened by buying 120hz sets but that in itself can have undesirable side effects such as the \"soap opera\" feel).  The blur was not near as bad as many 60hz LCDs I have seen, but it did give me a bit of a headache.  Then I went over to a friend's house and saw his Insignia plasma. Colors looked much more accurate and better yet, there was no blur.  I did not hear any buzzing or other problems usually associated with plasmas at high altitude.  I returned this set for the Panasonic TC-P42S2, and I am glad I did.  I have had the plasma for a while and I feel the plasma TV outdoes LCD in about every way (especially colors and blacks-I never knew blacks could be so black until the Panasonic).  I still give this TV a good rating.
