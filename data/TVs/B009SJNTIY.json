{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible value, one major flaw, read this for help configuring.", "Author": "Digitalis", "ReviewID": "R53BB9K5ZXBZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got mine (though not on Amazon) and I consider this TV to be an upgrade to my Samsung PN63C8000 plasma TV. It has one major flaw that will turn some people away.The Great Vizio Myth:First of all, I want to address a myth that is going around about this TV. It's being said that this TV has a \"soft appearance that is hard to describe and can't be fixed\". These reviews belong in the sci-fi horror fiction section. Use the settings that I post in this review, and it not only goes away, but the picture is about as good as my expensive plasma.Cons:1) The viewing angle is nowhere near as good as my plasma and probably not as good as other LED TVs. The perfect viewing angles appear to be within 30 degrees of the center. Therefore, if you position yourself at a 45 degree angle from where you intend to put it, know that the picture will be slightly degraded at that point. The color suffers the most, in my opinion. This is the one great flaw of this TV, which doesn't bother me at all. Take into consideration how far away you will be sitting and the size of the 60 degree viewing cone at that distance.2) Out-of-box settings are unacceptable and the TV is extremely difficult to calibrate - BUT! you have me here to help you, so you can breath easy now. I spent hours on this and used special tools to get it right.3) The stand is very basic, but very stable. From stand to the bottom of the viewable screen, there is 3-1/4\" clearance. From the top of the stand to the viewable screen, there are 2.5\" clearance. Personally, I use a TV stand that has two middle compartments and I put my center speaker into one of them, pointed slightly up.Pros:EVERYTHING else.Examples:1) Extremely bright. When I saw the brightness possibilities of this screen, I tried to get my Samsung to be that bright. I didn't even get close. You can make it dark if you want - and the TV will even automatically sense the amount of light in the room and respond to it, if you choose.2) Matte Screen - even now, I can see myself in my Samsung. My Vizio has no glare or reflection. I may not be able to live without this in the future. This feature is high on my list now.3) Extremely configurable. When you change picture settings on this TV, the device responds in a meaningful way. My Samsung, on the other hand, has many settings that appear to do nothing at all, even if you shift the slider from 0 to 100 - no change.4) Price. Black Friday was good to me this year. Even at the current Amazon price, I would buy it over a major brand. Mark my words, Vizio will be a major brand some day. I have yet to find one person that I know personally that does not approve of this company for several purchases of their products.5) Color. With my settings, I consider it to be very close to my expensive Samsung.6) Smart Features. Netflix, Amazon, Hulu Plus, YouTube, and a few others.7) Remote Control with Keyboard. Searching for shows on Netflix and Amazon has never been easier, due to the fact that you can flip the remote over and type on a QWERTY keyboard. They were also smart enough to put directional arrows and the four color buttons on the back. That helps a lot. There are also Amazon and Netflix buttons on the front of the remote that will get a lot of use. An M-Go button that won't get much use at all... is also present. The size of the remote is compact enough that I don't have to reposition it to reach buttons with my thumb.In a day in age where ILLogitech is screwing up our Harmony remotes by separating the buttons on either side of a big display screen, this is a refreshing and intellectual advancement in human sanity. Thank you Vizio, for the grand remote!Hints:1) If you're having trouble with Amazon Instant Video, select \"Your Video Library\" and you will be able to connect your Amazon account to the TV and get the free Amazon Prime content if you're a member.My Settings:Press the Menu button, then select Picture and press OK.Picture Mode: StandardBacklight: 88 (anything you want - this is the total brightness of the screen)Brightness: 50 (this setting will affect other settings.

I suggest you pop in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and watch the beginning through the introductory story of the Dwarven kingdom. You will see bright scenes of landscapes, dark scenes of the golden treasure room, skin tones, and much more. It's the perfect test movie.Edits --> * A lot of people are having trouble with TV sizes and model numbers. Vizio made the poor decision of grouping many sizes and models together and called them all their \"Razor\" line of TVs. This collection is not uniform and my settings will not work with all of them. My expectation is that these settings will work with TVs where the model number ends in \"A3\", which includes a 60\" and the 70\" that this review is actually in regard. You can try these settings for other models if you want, but I suggest paying more attention to Vizio's advanced features than the standard features. That's where I found the best approach when I was figuring all this out. Good luck!<--[...]", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best 60 inch LED for the price", "Author": "Kris", "ReviewID": "R2IVOPEJPO6VJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been patiently waiting for this TV to become available via Amazon, mainly because of the unbelievably low price and good review given on CNET, but got tired of waiting and ended up purchasing this TV on 10/13 from Costco.  They had just gotten a shipment in that day and once I saw it in the store, I knew I needed to get it.  CNET had mentioned that the off angle viewing was not as good on this set when compared to LEDs from other manufacturers, but I haven't had any problems viewing this TV even from extreme angles.  The TV was not quite as bright as the LG next to it at the store, but I believe this was mainly due to the matte finish of the screen.  The LG had a glossy screen which made the picture very bright, but it also reflected literally everything behind it.  My TV is now set up in a very sunny living room and the glare is minimal.  Much better than the 37 inch Sharp LCD it replaced.  For those looking for a basement TV, a glossy TV or a plasma might be the way to go, but for me, the matte finish was the best option.  The TV has an extremely thin bezel which I really appreciated because it allowed me to get a 60 inch screen size out of a TV that takes up the same space as many 55 inch units.  Out of the box, the colors were pretty good, but I am still hoping to find detailed color settings posted by CNET or elsewhere.  If anyone has a good link, please share :)  The smart features work reasonably well.  Amazon Prime and Netflix both ran just fine.  My only complaint so far is with the Amazon Prime interface.  It is very paired down when compared to the version offered over my PS3 and it took a long time to browse titles.  If you know what movie you want though, you can simply use the search function.  So far, I am completely satisfied with this set and for anyone debating between a $1000 LG or Samsung 55 inch and this 60 inch Vizio, I would highly suggest getting the Vizio.  I was really surprised at how much larger the screen size was when compared to the 55s next to it at the store and the sharpness and clarity of the picture was comparable to the LGs and Samsungs costing several hundred more.  Costco is currently selling this set for $979, so hopefully Amazon will price match once it gets in stock.***Update***I found detailed picture settings for this TV posted by katzmaier on CNET and thought would I pass it along for others to try.

There is an \"E\" at the end of the model, so it may differ slightly. I looked at the tv, and it looks to have all the same features. The only difference seems to be the remote. The E model remote lacks a qwerty keypad. But that is not a big loss, as the smart features on the tv are not that good anyway, as you'll see in my review.So this TV is part of Walmart's BF sale for a second year in row. It must have been successful for them to do it again. This TV retails normally between $900 and $1,000 during the year. At that price it is a decent TV. For $688 it is a huge deal. I bought this TV last year at $688. Now that I have had it for a year, I think it is good time to review it.First, a bit of background. I repair TVs for a living. I have seen all kinds of TV installations I have probably repaired pretty much every model out there at some point, everything from a $200 Emerson to the $5,000 Elite. They all can break, or I wouldn't have a job.I use this TV a lot. I have a PC hooked up, along with multiple gaming devices and a cable box. I have used every input except the VGA (my PC is hooked up with HDMI.) I have used an antenna as well. Channels scanning is fairly painless if you want to go over the air. You can easily add new channels to your scan, and even do a partial scan. A standard definition picture does not look too great on this TV, but that is pretty normal with HD TVs in general. And odds are you probably wont be using viewing much SD content, if any. Pop in a Bluray and this TV will shine.This model has a pretty good picture. Even out of the box the picture will have some pop. The color is vibrant. You have quite a few options to play with to tweak it to your desire. It has a 120 Hz refresh rate, and it works pretty well for the most part. Sometimes a fast moving object, like a football being thrown, may have a trail on it. It is not a pronounced effect, many people may not notice it unless they really look for it. I only see this when watching cable. When gaming, I don't see it. All in all the picture is fantastic, and looks like a TV more than twice the price.A common flaw with LED is light bleeding. On a really dark image, some areas of the screen may be slightly lighter than others. This effect is only noticeable on very dark images, I can't see it unless my screen is totally blank. But each TV can be different, it can show up in a different spot and to a different degree in different TVs. Like I said, it is common among all LED TVs, especially bigger ones like this. During normal viewing, odds are you will not notice it. But for some people this is a deal breaker. Again, this TV is also $688. I'm willing to live with that, and it never bothers me.The TV has a gaming mode, which disables the post image processing. The reason for this is that all that post processing makes the image delay as it reaches your screen. For normal TV viewing, that is fine. But for video games, input delay can make your games difficult to play. Input Delay (or Input Lag) is the time it takes the TV to display an image. This is not to be confused with Refresh Rates, they are totally different. A long input delay will probably lead to your gaming deaths in fast paced games. For some reason no brand seems to list this stat. But there are people testing this, and the delay of this model is 31 milliseconds. That gives it a rating of Great from the Input Lag Database, which is their second best rating after Excellent. So this is good for people who plan on playing video games. You cannot get much faster than this without using a dedicated monitor.As a smart TV however, this TV fails. It does have wifi, and it is functional, providing most of the common streaming apps out there. But the interface is clunky, and apps are rarely updated. If you want to stream stuff on this TV, you are better off using a set top box or gaming console to do it. The remote has a qwerty remote, but it is also subpar. The remote is not bluetooth, so you have to have a clear line of site to use it. The remote has 2 IR emitters, one for normal use, and one on the side for the qwerty keypad. The qwerty buttons are small and close together, making it difficult to use. The 2013 BF model for Walmart does not have a qwerty keypad, but you aren't missing much. Do not buy this TV for its smart features.If you really want the qwerty remote, it is possible to get one separately from a site like Shop Jimmy. This remote should work, the remote part number is 0980-0306-1060, here is a link, Shop Jimmy just happens to have them on sale for $5 right now. Otherwise they will be $15 on ebay.http://www.shopjimmy.com/vizio-0980-0306-1060-remote-control.htmAgain, this is only if you really, really want that qwerty keypad for the Walmart BF 2013 model.Now, for the broken TVs you see in other reviews. Last year's model for BF had a bad batch of panels. This led to some of those models having screen failures. Vizio addressed the issue by extending warranties for those serial numbers effected. I had this happen to my TV as well, 2 months after I bought it. I took it back to Walmart and exchanged it. I have no issues with the replacement I received, which is 9 months old now, and I use it a lot. I do not expect that will be an issue this year. Last year, the model was brand new. This year, Vizio has had all year to produce units for Walmart. So I would imagine those kinks would be worked out.There was also a sound issue where occasionally the audio would go out of sync with HDMI. I did experience this a few times as well. The issue was very specific as well, as it only happened with cable and satellite boxes. It never happened with my game consoles, and I play them more than I watch cable. This issue was fixed by a software update. I haven't had the problem since that update, which was early last year.So this TV is pretty solid. I do not regret my purchase at all. I did my research and got exactly what I expected. And for BF, this is still a great deal, even a year later. The only TV on BF 2013 that compares is from HHGregg. They will have a LG 60\" plasma for $600. If you are concerned about deep blacks, then that TV may be for you. Keep in mind that TV only has 2 HDMI ports, though, and you may get burn in on a plasma. If you do get a plasma, turn the cell brightness down and make sure to avoid having any still images on screen for too long, especially in the early life of the TV. The LG also has a higher Input Lag at 56 milliseconds and an \"Okay\" rating, so it is not as good for gaming as the Vizio. That is a full half a second for your inputs to show up on screen, which means you will probably die a lot playing Halo.Also, I recommend getting the extended warranty. That's only $68 at Walmart (10% of the TV cost,) and it adds 3 years to your warranty, giving you a full 4 years of coverage. Maybe you wont need it, but if you ever do, you'll be glad you got it! I work on all the brands, so you never can be sure how well they will hold up. It's also a good idea to compare different warranties from different stores. They may cover different things.I hope this helps!", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stellar Performance", "Author": "Anthony V. Mumolo", "ReviewID": "R3EP64LKRMB79T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Vizio E701i-A3 for about a month and I have been tweaking various settings the entire time to arrive at what I consider the best picture. I used two blu ray calibration discs; Digital Video Essentials and Spears and Munsil. The end result image with a high quality input source is jaw dropping. Colors are rich and beautifully rendered; clarity and detail are exactly what I would expect from a world class display. Even watching movies I've seen before is a revelation and a totally new experience.Just a few years ago I would have expected to pay as much as $3000.00 or more to get this kind of performance. To say I'm happy with this TV is an understatement. I've been a home theater enthusiast for over sixteen years and this set is the end point of my home theater evolution. With this display I feel I have the best theater experience I've ever had and it beats every walk in theater presentation I've seen. If anyone has not taken the time to properly calibrate ANY HDTV they should not be posting opinions on the quality of the display since NO display set at factory defaults will render the best visual experience in a home environment setting. It takes a willingness to invest some time and effort if you really want to see what the display is capable of. I can't comment on the audio aspect of this set because I run all my sound all the time through my surround speaker system. BTW, It is not possible to evaluate a display in a very bright store environment alongside other displays because you have no idea how each display is set up. A display can look like crap in the store and look absolutely beautiful when properly calibrated in your home. In a store they are set to stand out and get your attention not to be accurate and they are almost always using a split source so the same signal is not reaching every display equally; this can mislead you into thinking one display looks better than the others. About the only thing you can evaluate accurately in a store is viewing angle.For what it's worth I'm including my calibrated settings although as always they may differ from other set ups depending on room environment and personal taste. I started with contrast at 75 and sharpness set at \"1\" but after repeated critical viewing I found I actually got a better picture with my current settings. I also found Adaptive Luma set at medium created a better picture than set to off. Personal preference comes into play on this setting and the sharpness setting as well. I spent a lot of time watching the same demonstration material over and over again to be certain I was getting exactly the picture I wanted. In my opinion this is a great HDTV and a great VALUE.So here are my E70 settings and my system components.Yamaha RX-V465 ReceiverOppo BD-P83 Blu Ray Universal playerInfinity RS3 Front speakers and Infinity center channel speakerBose surround speakersPicture Mode: MovieBacklight  60Brightness 50Contrast  72Color:  49tint  0Sharpness +2Color temperature NormalRed Gain: 106Green gain: 107Blue gain: 116Red offset: 128Green offset: 128Blue offset: 128Smooth motion effect: LowReal cinema mode: SmoothNoise reduction: offmpeg fr:  offColor enhancement: offAdaptive Luma: MediumFilm mode: autoBacklight control: offAmbient Light sensor: off", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "LCD panel failures & audio sync problems (now addressed with warranty extension and firmware update)", "Author": "S.

See below for details.)- Severe audio-video sync problems (In mid-January 2013, Vizio released a firmware update to fix this issue. See below for details.)- Still some glare in bright room- Takes about 18 seconds to \"boot up\" from power on- Only one shared composite/component input for older devices- Slightly gray blacks and somewhat uneven back-lighting, although this likely varies between individual units- DLNA and smart-app implementations are very crude (you are probably better off getting a dedicated device to do these, like a Roku or Apple TV)- Ports hard to access on back, which is particularly a problem for the USB port, if you want to plug and unplug (somewhat inherent in thin flat-panel TVs)LCD PANEL FAILURE ISSUEMany owners, including me, were reporting a problem where the image would disappear but the backlight and sound would remain on. This required full replacement of the TV. On 2/8/2013, Vizio acknowledged this problem in a \"special bulletin\" revealing that a bad batch of chips were installed in units with serial numbers ranging from LFTRNWAN3800001 to LFTRNWAN4805300. It also affects a range of the 70\" E701i-A3 models. Vizio extended the warranty from one to two years for that specific problem. However, Vizio said it was \"promptly\" and \"proactively\" contacting registered customers about the possible issue, but, disappointingly, there is no evidence that they have done this beyond the bulletin and a blog post.AUDIO-VIDEO SYNC ISSUEMany people were reporting a variety of audio-video sync problems, particularly with cable boxes and Dolby Digital audio. Vizio initially blamed the cable boxes and had people set them to output PCM audio (rather than Dolby Digital). Unfortunately, that downgraded the audio to two channels only. However, in mid-January 2013, Vizio released a firmware update (version 1.1.5, which can be seen under Menu>Help>System Info>Version) that allegedly fixes the problem.Also, the Vizio seems more sensitive than average to different HDMI cables. Video periodically drops out completely (screen flashes to black for a few seconds) with cables that work fine with other displays.QUALITY/CUSTOMER SERVICEWhen my first unit failed with the LCD panel problem after only 23 days of use, I was very disappointed that Vizio initially only offered to replace it with a \"recertified\" unit. After a great deal of insistence, they agreed to send a new one.In addition, when I communicated with them about the audio-video sync problem, I was disappointed that they were blaming my cable box that worked fine with my other displays, and that they insisted that I downgrade to two-channel audio to \"fix\" their problem. In my online chat, the Vizio representative stated the following: \"The newer TVs that we manufacturer are set up for PCM rather than Dolby Digital. So it is not a defect in the TV, you will just have to connect it a different way.\"I have mixed feelings at this point.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Little Smart TV", "Author": "T. Gaydos \"Tom G.\"", "ReviewID": "RN0WPMXOPG690", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an incredibly well designed 24-inch Smart TV with a stunning picture, slim profile, plenty of useful apps, and a low price. The only thing holding it back from being a perfect 5-star TV is the lack of a QWERTY remote to make proper use of the apps and having only 1 HDMI connection.DESIGNAll black with a very slim bezel and less than 2\" total depth. This thing is pretty sexy, especially for a \"budget\" TV. The stand will make some happy, other no so much. It's basically a fixed picture frame style where the TV itself sits directly on whatever surface you have it on. This gives it more of an all-in-one PC appearance than that of a TV. It sits at a fixed angle that I didn't care for at first, but it's actually the perfect angle for sitting on a kitchen counter, which is where I have it. At any rate, I like the design as does my fiancee. It looks much more high-end than its price would indicate. At less than 8 lbs and with a VESA 100 mounting pattern, you could easily and inexpensively mount this pretty much anywhere.SET UPSetting up the TV itself took about 5 minutes. Unboxed it, plugged it into the wall and cable box, turned it on and set up the WiFi. Everything worked perfectly. The picture calibration out of the box on \"normal\" was one of the most accurate default picture representations I've ever seen. I've been seeing this comment a lot with Vizio's new E-series line. This is rare, as I usually spend between 15 and 30 minutes tweaking the picture settings. About 2 minutes with this one and I was happy. Logging into the apps was more challenging than it should have been because Vizio inexplicably doesn't include their nifty little QWERTY remote with this set. More on that in the Apps section below. All-in-all...pretty easy to set up. The lack of a 2nd HDMI port bothers me a bit. It's 2013 and everything connects via HDMI. Add a 2nd port, Vizio.PICTUREThe picture on this TV is stunning with vibrant colors and deeper blacks than I expected from an edge lit LED setup. The slim bezel really helps the picture pop and, as I noted above, the default picture settings are very accurate. There are several picture mode presets, including an eye-popping \"vibrant\" setting for those preferring boosted color saturation. I've never seen a TV of this size at any price point with a better picture.SOUNDThis set has stereo 2W front-firing speakers built-in which can be set to mono, stereo, or a simulated surround setting. If you're going to be gaming or watching movies on this set, you'll want a sound bar or a decent 2.1/3.1 setup, for everyone else these built-in speakers will suffice. When set on the simulated surround mode the sound stage is surprisingly wide to the point where it will occasionally bounce a sound so that is seems to be coming from behind you. It's nothing earth-shattering and there is no real bass, as expected, but as far as built-in TV speakers, they do a pretty good job. For my kitchen use of this TV, they're perfectly serviceable.APPSI have been waiting for this TV specifically because it's a 24\" 1080p LED Smart TV. It is currently the only 24\" Smart TV on the market. The apps available are most of the ones you would hope for; Netflix, Amazon video, Vudu, Hulu Plus, Rhapsody, Pandora, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Notably missing is HBO Go and MLB.tv, neither of which are currently available on any Vizio TV. The apps that are available respond quickly, and most can run while the current program is playing (you can tweet while watching the game, for example). With all of these great apps, I was absolutely floored that Vizio chose not to include it's QWERTY remote with this TV. It's a puzzlingly stupid decision as the lack of this QWERTY remote makes using the apps unnecessarily difficult. Once you're logged in to all of your apps, basic searching is OK, as the included remote is functional and responsive, but the lack of the QWERTY keyboard on the back makes using Facebook and Twitter highly unlikely, which is a shame because otherwise they are solid apps.CONCLUSIONThe picture quality, high-end design touches, and quality apps more than make up for the lack of QWERTY remote and single HDMI port. If you're looking or a Smart TV for a kitchen, bedroom, or dorm room, this set is a stunner that's easy on the wallet. This is my 4th Vizio TV dating back 6 years and all of them function perfectly and without a single issue, so this is a trustworthy brand. If you're on the fence, go get it. You won't be sorry.UPDATEI purchased this QWERTY remote: New!

The Samsung's panel died on me about 2 weeks ago after working great since I bought it in May 2011. Luckily, I had purchased a 3 year warranty through Squaretrade and they got my refund to me super quick (highly recommended). I came across this VIZIO and it basically owns the best reviews for a 50 inch LED (now I see why), so after a little research I went for it and I really feel like I hit a home run with this one.Picture Quality:Having previously owned the 43 inch Samsung Plasma, I can definitely say the blacks are nicer on the Samsung, but that's  be supposed to be a strength for a plasma TV. Being an LED, this VIZIO has more than adequate blacks in its display of HD and even standard channels. The overall display of standard channels on this VIZIO have a decent looking picture. HD movies are true 1080p and beautiful.Sound Quality:I think the sound quality of this TV is adequate, not awesome, but adequate. If you're wanting an impressive home theater experience from an audio standpoint then I think a sound bar or a surround sound system would be the way to go here.Functionality:The TV, out of the box takes about 15 minutes to set up if you're taking your time. The remote is a little small, but unless you have massive hands it shouldn't be an issue. When you go to turn on the TV it takes about 15 seconds from when you press the power button to when you see the screen display the picture. Maybe that's too long for some people, it doesn't bother me. The Wifi connection process is fast, smooth, and seamless. As far as the Smart TV features go, it's very non-invasive. Pops up at the press of the big \"V\" button midway up the remote and it displays the scrollable bar along the bottom of the screen with everything from Netflix & Hulu Plus to YouTube, Twitter, Skype, and Facebook.I know this review has nothing to do with a Squaretrade warranty, but I felt compelled to reiterate that their warranties are so valuable. I bought a 4 year warranty for this TV that cost $99.99, but I found a 35% off coupon code that made the warranty only $70 after tax. Just thought I'd throw that out there.Overall, I would say if you're looking to go bigger than the 40 inch range with a HDTV that really delivers in quality and performance without breaking the bank, then this is the TV for you!", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal TV ~ Takes HD to a whole new level", "Author": "Andy Rosenblum \"Andy Rosenblum\"", "ReviewID": "R1N6E62PWU29IH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is without a doubt the finest TV that I've ever had the pleasure to use. In comparison to my 5 year old Samsung HD TV, this one makes the Samsung look like a part of ancient history. The first thing that grabs you is the incredibly sleek design. The bezel surrounding the TV is razor thin, thus there is no wasted space at all. Not only does this provide for excellent viewing, but it makes it possible to place the TV in a cabinet that's just slightly larger than the TV picture itself. It's unlikely that you would want to put it in a cabinet, first because it's difficult to find one that would accommodate it, and second because the TV looks beautiful fully exposed. As for the picture, it's extremely brilliant and so lifelike that when watching sporting events, you get the feeling that you're actually at the event. The same applies to watching any live broadcast, such as the news. The colors are vibrant and right on. In addition, the vividness is spectacular under all lighting conditions, as well when viewing from an angle. I have mine placed in a room that gets a lot of sunlight, yet somehow, the picture looks just as brilliant as it does in subdued lighting conditions. Although I have my own sound system hooked up to the TV, prior to doing so I tested the internal speakers and found them to be excellent for a TV of this size. The remote is very user friendly and works very similar to a smartphone. One of the nicest features of this TV is the built in wi-fi. I guess that almost all TV's have this feature now, but Vizio brings it to a whole new level. The wi-fi enables you to access virtually any channel that you could hope for, including the obvious ones such as Netflix and Amazon. There are so many other streaming channels available that you'd be hard pressed not to find something great to watch. I own another, much smaller Vizio TV, which I purchased for our kitchen, and I'm amazed at the picture and sound quality on that one as well. Vizio seems to have an advantage over other manufacturers, in that they provide a super premium product at a cost that is significantly lower than the competition. It amazes me that this TV cost about half what I paid for my Samsung, yet it's light years ahead in quality and features. The only concern that I have with Vizio, is that they don't have as long a track record as some of the other TV manufacturers. Only time will tell if their quality is long-lasting. Undoubtedly, by the time you read this, something new and improved will come along, but for the moment anyway, I believe that this is the finest TV that you could purchase for the price. It really is an awesome and thoroughly enjoyable experience to use and as far as I'm concerned, there are no negatives. I believe that you'll really enjoy using this fantastic product and that it will provide you with a great deal of pleasure.  It's much more than a TV, it's an experience, and a really, really good one at that.

Luzzi \"Music Mavin\"", "ReviewID": "R3DA1JHHSWQQGC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, after reading so many reviews for the Sharp 70\" which I was so close to buying, I decided to go $1-200 cheaper than the cheapest Sharp model in the 70\" lineup and buy the Vizio.  I've always wanted to try Vizio because I've heard a lot of good things about them so I did after finding that this was only about 1 of 3 or 4 of the total 70\" LCDs on the market from which to choose.  My choices were very limited.  I read much good and much bad about the Sharp image.  So, after reading about the Vizio and finding less negatives for their model than for the Sharp, I went with Vizio.Sharp apparently has issues with the big ones that actually require professionals to come to the house to calibrate the image because buyers just can't make it look good no matter what they do.  Many of those complaining about this were seemingly \"qualified\" to make the adjustments, having such extensive experience with LCDs.  Also, I don't know what Sharp is doing with their model numbers but I swear, I had to (with a fine-tooth comb mind you) painstakingly go through the exact specifications of each of the models, and I think there were like 8 70\" Sharp models to go through at rather dramatically different price points.  Reading reviews for each, each had their own unique image issues even though they all had the same comments regarding not being able to adjust the picture to look good at all.  By the time I was done with hours and hours of research over about 2 weeks, I basically gave up.  That's why I was so happy to find the 70\" Vizio.I may provide updates in the future.  I've only had the TV running for about a week so I can only comment on so much at this point.  If you have questions for me, or if you want me to test something for you, post a message and I'll reply.On CNET I read that the smaller version of this TV, the 60\", likely performs worse that the 70\" because they fixed an issue the 70\" models that existed in the 60\".  They complained a lot about blacks not being true.  That's important to me but I kept the faith and went with it anyway.  Well, I'm not dissatisfied with the blacks at all.  I keep my backlight at 100, contrast at 90 and brightness at 30 for a deep but very bright, excellently contrasted picture, and this helps the blacks be almost true.  However, if I turn these setting higher, blacks are just a very dark gray so this may or may not apply to you depending upon the settings.My only complaint is about the white.  This complaint would in NO WAY influence my decision to buy this Vizio, but it does exist and I think it's more of a size issue because I noticed the same thing on the Sharps when comparing them side by side in Best Buy.  The 60\" Sharp had the best pure white and was very bright.  The 70\" Sharp that I contemplated buying showed white as a very light blue that's just a hue, like the bluish you might see while looking at white glaciers.  It was noticeably dimmer than the 60\" Sharp.  The 80\" Sharp cinemawide was the dimmest with the greatest bluish hue whites.  I would not buy that one.  The picture just isn't good enough.I have the 70\" Vizio side by side with the 37\" Samsung running the same shows and the Samsung white is white (snow for instance was pure white on Samsung, bluish hue on Vizio).  Given the Samsung's smaller size though, and, if the blueish hue is the result of the large size of the TV and edge-lit technology, that would make sense.  I even turned the contrast, backlighting, and brightness to 100% on the Vizio and it was still bluish.  However, oddly enough, while playing my PS3, I noticed that the whites were pure!  Explain that!  There goes anything that might cause the bluish hue to come from size (but it still seems apparent to me that size causes dimness, perhaps more so with the newer edge-lit technology).  I don't know.  I'm not an expert but after seeing all of the different things that can impact picture quality, I'm almost left with the thought, why bother?  You've got the following things weighing in to what you're trying to compare: Screen size, picture settings, each TVs built-in technology (60 vs. 120Hz, 720i vs. 720p vs. 1080i vs. 1080p), whether the channel is in HD, what the program you're watching is shot in (non-HD, 720, 1080), streaming vs. non-streaming content (Netflix, Hulu, On Demand, etc.), bandwidth speed and the quality of your wired/wireless connection, whether on a gaming system or watching any of the above forms of programming, and the list goes on and on.Here are the settings on both the Vizio and Samsung I've been comparing 24/7:Backlight: 100Contrast: 90Brightness: 30Color: 50Tint: +5 on Vizio, 0 on Samsung in order to make skin tones and other colors match on both TVsSharpness: 100 (not always possible depending upon the channel and program where it's just too grainy)Noise Reduction: LowAfter seeing and researching all of this, and since it's impossible to compare apples with apples if you have the chance to do so when comparing TVs of different sizes, brands, technologies etc., I've come to the conclusion that you should just buy what you like after seeing it in person.  I never saw the Vizio before I bought it but it's the best advice I can give in my opinion (I took a chance that paid off so far).  Even when I change channels from HD to standard, some look horrible (even on the Samsung), and some look fantastic.  How do you know what's supposed to look good when you have no idea what each channel change is going to do to your image?  I would say on average, every other channel I change looks better on the other TV.  Samsung excels in whites, and the Vizio seems to be more colorful and sharp in many programs.Other than that, although it's a smart TV with built-in wi-fi, there's no browser.  It only has apps but a good selection: YouTube, Hulu, a Yahoo suite, Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Rhapsody, Vudu, twitter, and Facebook.  And other than that, for some reason, the menu is somewhat blurry even with the sharpness at 100.  Strange but I really don't care since the actual picture doesn't look like that.  I don't nit-pick on remote controls and ease of menu navigation.  They work fine and the flip-over qwerty keyboard on the remote also works well.  I have no other complaints at all so far.So the question is, am I happy with it so far?  YES.  Very happy for $1699, with the only issue being the white.  I was a little upset to see it was offered at Costco for $1499 though!  I thought I go the best deal in town :(Anyway, if you're really anal about detailed specifics in picture quality and whatnot, knock yourself out trying to determine what to buy.  After this experience I'm done with all of it.  Support a company that you know is established, tried and true, which you've had good experience with in the past, see and compare the images in person before buying (even if you ultimately buy it online) and buy from them.Again, I'd be happy to set up tests for you with your own settings and give you my opinion.

TV's picture is AWESOME!  My cable connection is just basic standard def, but still looks good.  (I tried some over the air HD signals for a little while and it was an awesome picture.)  I've streamed Netflix in HD and it looks very good.  I still had to use my Comcast digital converter box (not real happy about that, but it's ok).The one BIG issue you MAY run into is with the wireless connection to your router.  I could not get the TV to connect wirelessly to my router at first.  I have a basic Netgear wireless G router (WGR-614).  Googled the issue and saw numerous reports from others about incompatibility between Netgear routers and Vizio TV's.  Tried some of the solutions to no avail.  Finally what I figured out is that the TV would not connect using WPA2-PSK (AES).  I had to set my router to use both WPA-PSK (TKIP) and WPA2-PSK (AES) and the TV finally connected using the WPA-PSK (TKIP) security!  The tip off that it was going to work was when I was in the on-screen keyboard screen entering the wireless passphrase it showed \"WPA-PSK\" above the passphrase entry box.  Making this security change on my router is somewhat of a security risk, but in the rural area I live in I didn't mind.  You should be aware of the possible security risk where you are if you run into the same problem.Once I connected I tested out the Netflix app.  It connected to my account and streamed my first test movie just fine (showed flipping between medium HD & high HD quality) with just some slight buffering as it got started.  I haven't played much with other apps yet to report on them.The remote does have tiny buttons, but it's not too awful for me.

VIZIO is working with its suppliers, retailers and consumers to resolve the issue as quickly as possible for affected users.  As part of its continued dedication to customer satisfaction, VIZIO is proactively communicating with its customers through direct contact with registered owners, through VIZIO's retailers and through online and social media about the potential issue, what to look for, and how to reach VIZIO's dedicated support team to receive help.What is the Nature of the Issue and Affected Range of Products?In a small percentage of units with serial numbers in the ranges of LFTRNWAN3800001 to LFTRNWAN4805300 for Model E601i-A3 and LFTRNXAN4500001 - LFTRNXAN4702936 for Model E701i-A3, users may experience a loss of video on the display although audio can still be heard.  This issue is attributed to a limited batch of chip assemblies from a supplier, in which there is a small percentage chance that the chip assembly prematurely fails; this causes the timing control board to be disabled, which disrupts the video signal to the display.  This potential issue appears to occur typically around the first 500 hours of usage or first few months of normal usage and does not present a safety concern.What is VIZIO's Response to Action?VIZIO has promptly notified its customers of the possible issue so that affected users can have their units repaired or replaced free of charge.  In addition, VIZIO is also extending its standard one-year limited warranty to two years from the date of purchase for this specific issue to ensure that customers who purchased the E601i-A3 or E701i-A3 can continue to enjoy their TV with full peace of mind.What Should VIZIO Customers do?If you have a VIZIO E-Series 60\" or 70\" TV with a serial number that falls within the ranges of LFTRNWAN3800001 to LFTRNWAN4805300 for Model E601i-A3 and LFTRNXAN4500001 - LFTRNXAN4702936 for Model E701i-A3 and experience a loss of video, please call VIZIO's Customer Care team toll free at 855-209-4106 or email them at: special.bulletin@vizio.com to directly reach our dedicated service team who will assist in resolving your issue as quickly as possible.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV for Quality and Price", "Author": "V.

Some of the issues other reviewers were having sounded like they might be user error. Either way, I feel this is a trusted brand at the right price so and the size that I needed so I went ahead and bought it regardless of the reviews.Background: My other tvs are Pioneer Kuro models I bought several years back (and have never regretted - they are simply the best), but I needed a smaller tv for our exercise room. Based on the location of our equipment, 32\" was a little small so I needed something in the 37 to 40\" range and this one fit the bill nicely.Setup: The directions for putting on the stand did not work well for me. The quick start guide had me lay the tv flat on the floor and then try to mount the stand. The problem with this is with the tv flat on the floor, unless you live in a split level and hang the bottom of the tv over the stair it is nearly impossible to hold up the tv while trying to attact the stand. I disassembled the stand and went in a different order, attaching the back of the stand to the tv first. Then I could use the stand to hold onto, lifting up the set and attaching the base. This seems like a much better process and I don't know why the directions don't follow this route.Looks: This TV looks great. The thin bezel is excellent, giving the appearance of almost all screen. Really looks great. The speakers are thin along the bottom of the set and hardly noticeable. Overall I really like the appearance of this set.Remote:Not fancy or expensive, but nice. Buttons have a tactile feel, with a real click for button presses. I like this approach. It also feels good in the hand.Startup: I had no issues here. Menus were responsive and intuitive (no delays like some other review said). It found my home network just fine and the onscreen keyboard to enter network password was very quick and responsive. Easy step by step process to register the tv and apps. Picture came on at the end of this and looked great. I was in a room where the light was changing slightly from outside and I could see the tv adjust by the second. I don't care for this feature so I turned it off as other reviewers have done.This feature was easy to find in the picture adjustment settings and while there I could see the set has a good amount of adjustments available. I generally don't like to mess with these too much so I chose one of the presets, \"basketball.\" I chose this because basketball is my favorite sport. I like the way they dribble up and down the court. But I digress.I tuned to ESPN (DirecTv) and was very happy with the picture. Colors were bright and the screen really looked good. Viewing angles are amazing and have come a long way over the years. I remember earlier sets where off angle viewing was challenge, with the picture looking very dim the farther off angle you got. No such problem with this set. You can view from as far off angle as you can get until you are looking at the side of the tv, with no noticeable change in brightness. Reaction times are very good and the set handles motion very well.The TV was set up in a room with one window on the right side of the room. Viewing from the left and straight on I could not notice and reflectivity but moving over to the right side I could notice the reflections from the window. It was fairly bright outside so unless you are viewing off angle opposite a window during daytime hours this shouldn't be too much of a problem.I was very satisfied with the sound as well. I left the SRS setting turned on and the sound was crisp and clear with good volume. I'm sure I won't have any issues hearing over our exercise equipment in this room.Now it was time to try the internet features. One feature I really looked forward to on this TV was the ability to watch Amazon Prime videos. If you don't have Amazon Prime - what are doing? You are doing it wrong. The best $79.99 you will ever spend. Anyway, I pressed the dedicated Amazon button on the remote and got no response. I tried the Netflix and M-Go buttons located in the top row as well and they worked find. So checking the quick start guide, I was directed to the V.I.A. button to get started with Vizio internet apps. I was then directed to select \"connected tv store\" to search for apps that were not yet installed. Since I did not see Amazon prime anywhere in the menu, I was hopeful I could find it here. Upon selecting, I was advised that there was an update to this app and to select \"OK\" to download and update this app before I would be able to use it. This took only a minute or two and upon finishing I found that Amazon Prime was now one of the available apps. I went through the sign up process so the tv would recognize my Prime account and allow me access to content. This brought up an on screen code and I was directed to my computer to enter this on the amazon site. Once completed the tv recognized that I had registered it with amazon and allowed access to the thousands of shows and movies available to me as a Prime subscriber.Once this was completed I exited out of Prime and attempted to use the dedicated Amazon button on the remote once again and this time, success!I loaded up Prime and selected in Instant Videos to see the selection of HD movies available to me for free. To my surprise, Evil Dead 2 was one of the choices. I selected this movie and after about one minute it was ready for viewing. Playback was flawless, the picture looked great and I was pleasantly surprised with the SRS audio as well.Overall I am extremely happy with my choice. I don't understand the issues other reviewers have had; maybe these were earlier production units and these glitches have been resolved on later units. I don't think there is a better set out there for $479.

I placed it near my LG LM7600 47\" model (which I have been extremely happy with) for a side-by-side comparison.  After some tweaking of the Picture settings, the results were very satisfactory.  I realize that comparing the two models maybe like comparing apples and oranges, since there was a big price difference between them.  But for the price of the Vizio I think that its picture quality and sound are very good.I also set-up the Network connection (via WiFi) and experienced no initial problems.....at least with the internet connection.  I signed on to Amazon and scrolled through its offerings with no problems.........but I didn't attempt to load any movies.  Honestly I didn't buy this model for its Smart TV functions since I am taking it to a mountain cabin where there is no internet access.It does take several seconds to power up (much longer than the LG), but that's no problem for me.  I think that it maybe connecting to the internet prior to bringing up the screen view.  It will be interesting to see if it activates faster at the cabin with no network to connect with.The settings menu is basic, not nearly as detailed as the LG.  For example, I did not see a way to update the firmware via online connection, so not sure if that is an option. Also the only input connection I tried was the coaxial cable for TV viewing.  Once I set it up at the cabin I will connect to a blu-ray player via \"HDMI\", and the receiver via the \"component\" & \"optical audio\" outputs and check their status.  At its price point I think that it is a good deal and will initially conclude with a tentative endorsement....to be followed by a later update.Day 20 Update:So far, no problems experienced.  Granted I only use the unit for (1) watching BRs, DVDs, and as a PC monitor at a mountain cabin with no OTA or Cable TV reception.  I used Disney's WOW calibration disc but the changes were minimal using the \"Custom\" picture setting.  I lowered the Sharp level slightly from the default setting.  The other default settings were already close to the WOW calibrated results.I have noticed that the Picture is noticeably better watching Blu-rays than DVDs, but that could be attributed to the Blu-ray player (Panasonic BMP-BDT310).  The built-in speakers are adequate, but I am using a 5.1 audio theater speaker setup, with great sound.As stated above, It still takes several seconds to power up (over 20 seconds).  Another possible reason may be because it is Direct-Lit LED (an economical type of Full-Array LED that uses fewer LED lites behind the screen).  That is definitely the reason the unit is thicker than an edge-lit model.  No light bleeding or clouding noticed and it seems that the picture quality has continued to improve over the past 20 days.For the price I think that it is as good a set as could be expected and so I continue to rate it 5 stars.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "M. Maney \"Marty913\"", "ReviewID": "R3OB7LO3CG8TFU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wanted to like this TV but it had a couple (three actually) problems that made it difficult to live with.The first problem was a definite shift toward green that was impossible to get rid off. It is possible this was limited to my unit only but I was reluctant to take a chance on that. The second and more serious issue was with off-axis viewing. I have an L-shaped seating area and viewing from any location other than directly in front of the set very disappointing. Colors began to wash out with as little as a 20-30 degree viewing angle shift. I understand this can be somewhat of a  problem with some (all perhaps?) edge-lit LCD's but did not expect it to be this bad. I'm sure back-lit LED's would have helped but of course the unit would have to be a little thicker, and perhaps a little more expensive. Lastly, even straight-on viewing showed a lack of brightness uniformity across the screen. The edges (sides) were very bright and sharp, center screen much less so. This also resulted in differing black levels across the screen.I am in the process of returning the set. I do think Vizio is on the right track and there were bright spots to the 70\". If the back-light issues were addressed, I thing most of the issues would go away (assuming the tint problem was my model only).As always, Amazon was extremely easy to deal with.

I tend to upgrade every other year or so, and am never completely satisfied, always needing the \"next best thing\". This year i was kind of in a bind, my living room had a beautiful pn51D7000 samsung plasma hooked up to a 5.1 surround system, but i just needed something bigger. The samsung plasma had a beautiful picture, but i watch a ton of movies and really wanted that \"immersion\" that a bigger tv provides (especially with the surround sound) My fiance thinks i am crazy for wanting a bigger tv, and wasnt entirely supportive at first because she thought i was going to spend a ton of money. So, i did my research, and was amazed at how much prices have come down even over the past year. I initially was going to stay with plasma as i loved the fact that i didnt see any motion, and loved the truly inky blacks. I did not need 3d, as my samsung had it and i probably only used it twice (not that it looked bad, i just dont like wearing the glasses as it made everything even darker than a plasma already is) My criteria this time around were basically 60\" screen, good picture and bright vibrant colors under $1500. I have never owned a vizio before, i have always owned samsungs and lg's, my thoughts were that vizio was a cheap brand that sold cheaply made products. When i first heard about this E601-A3 on amazon, and saw the price, i figured it would be very cheap and i would hate it compared to the samsung. I then started reading reviews, and figured with amazon's awesome return policy that i might as well try this tv, knowing i could return it if it wasnt up to my high standards. I ordered it on a tuesday and received it friday, mounted it on my wall and was very surprised at the quality all around. The tv is beautifully thin, basically looks like a picture frame around the screen. The picture settings needed to be tweaked, and i am still tweaking them a little but the picture now is almost perfect. I tend to mess with settings the first 2 weeks i have any tv anyway, but i have no doubt i can get the picture to look exactly how i want it to look with a little more time. As far as flashlighting or light bleeding goes, it is there. It must be an inherent problem with all side lit led tv's, but i will say i only notice it when turning the tv on or off. When i am watching HD content, whether its through fios or on blu ray the black looks very very close to how my plasma looked, it really is that good. And i notice no light bleed in the corners at all, which is something i half expected. The smart function works very well, i use netflix all the time and love how easy it is to bring up movies/shows. A lot of people complain about the remote, i actually enjoy it and think its designed perfectly. Last but not least, i love playing sports games on ps3 and absolutely cannot have a tv with any lag whatsoever. This tv comes equipped with a gamer mode in the main options, it allows you to turn the mode on for all of the preset picture modes (vivid, standard, movie etc) and works flawlessly! i notice absolutely no delay or motion blur WHAT SO EVER. Very very very impressed, this tv makes a baseball game look like i am actually there, i actually have to squint when looking at the lights or the sun, its that good! Sorry for the long review, but i was in a huge bind over whether or not to get another plasma or try out an edge lit LED. For a tv this solid, with the options it comes with and the quality of the picture, i would have EASILY paid $1500. Just please get a surround sound system if you get this tv, a tv this nice deserves it!", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Impressed!", "Author": "music man", "ReviewID": "R2SNSADQGI1R1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seems like every year I upgrade tv's.  Started with a 42\" lcd vizio, bumped up to a 50\" panasonic plasma, now this 60\" monster.  I really like it, especially for $999...walmart does have this on black friday for $688 in store.. So if you're one of those people, jump on it!PICTUREComing from plasma I knew the picture wouldn't be quite as good, and after playing with picture settings I gotta be honest there isn't much of a drop off in picture quality. Also coming from plasma I like my picture on the darker side, I feel it gives more \"depth\" and the best part is I don't have any bleeding when it comes to the Edge-lit factor. Will the picture blow you away? If this is your first HDTV absolutely, but otherwise you're not going to see a huge difference from the HDTV's from the past couple of years.  The 120hz processor is all you'll ever need, at least when it comes to cable..we have \"charter\" and they only support 60hz.  And as far as blu-rays or xbox and ps3..120hz will prove to be enough so there is no lag.  NHL 13 and Battlefield 3 are pretty damn fun on this 60 incher.SOUNDWhat can I say, it works, it's not anything special, it certainly can get loud enough but in the end they are just tv speakers. And if you are that concerned about the sound that it influences your purchasing decision, you should go out and at least get a \"home theater in a box.\"  Personally, sound is as important as picture, I have a 7.2 system (7 satellite speakers, 2 subwoofers) running off of my Onkyo NR609 receiver, total set up cost me just under 1K.  I need to feel the mortars and artillery from \"Band of Brothers\", \"The Pacific\", \"The Thin Red Line\"...etc. So like I said, go spend a couple hundred dollars on a 5.1 system, or for God sakes at least get a $80 sound bar.REMOTEFeels very well made to me, heavy, and the qwerty keyboard is very innovative and at times can be quite handy.  To be honest tho I don't use tv remotes often, my Onkyo remote controls my cable box, tv, blu-ray player, and of course the Onkyo receiver.  So I'm set.APPS/WI-FISo far just used Netflix, haven't tried my Amazon prime account yet but in all honesty, it is what it is and if one works there's no reason the rest won't.  Wi-fi was easy to set-up..so even if you're just a little tech savvy there's no reason it won't be easy for you.Let's see, what else?? No dead pixels, special delivery was good, they came in put it in my room, unpackaged it, assembled the stand and hoisted it on my TV center. They will take the packaging if you want but I think it's a good idea to just throw it in the basement as you may never know when you'll need it. Personally it's nice to have because I tend to sell mine every fall, although the only thing missing from this tv is 3D and I know I would just about never use it, so I'll be good with this tv for longer than usual.IMPORTANT! If before delivery the tv was in a cold vehicle like mine was(I'm a \"Yooper\")...make sure you give it plenty of time to warm up (I waited 4 hours)..otherwise your tv experience will be over before it could start!Here's my picture settings, and it's perfect as far as I'm concerned. Again, I like the dark picture..it prevents the \"bleeding\" from occurring and lest you forget, this a damn big \"flash light\" so why on earth would you want a bright picture?Back light- 50Brightness- 45Contrast- 45Color- 54Tint- 0Sharpness- 0 (the higher the sharpness, the \"grainier\" the picture..try it for yourself)Color temp- I switch between normal-cool, never 'warm' as I feel reds and oranges tend to be dominant and overwhelmingSmooth Motion effect- OffReal cinema mode- Off (that horrible 'soap opera' look...hate it!)Noise Reduction- OffMPEG NR- HighColor enhancement- NormalAdaptive Luma- OffFilm mode- OffBacklight Control- OPCAmbient Light Sensor- OffHope this is helpful!

Sports look right at home on this HDTV. The viewing angles (on ALL LCD/LEDs that I've viewed) are noticeably less than specified. In the case of this model, the viewing angle is very wide -- still, not plasma wide, but fade becomes noticeable only way out at the edge, ~150\u00ba off axis. Picture quality is, as expected, FIRST-RATE. It is, however, difficult to quantify picture quality at all anymore. Fidelity seems to no longer be the standard of comparison - instead - very high contrast and ultra saturated color is the expectation. If that is your liking, this TV can be adjusted to that as well as most.AUDIO: Some nice features are: 1) \"speakers off\" when external surround sound speakers are used; 2) \"lip sync\" to tighten the audio and video synch; 3) \"SRS Studio Sound HD\", a very nice audio \"depth\" enhancement when NOT using surround sound; 4) \"SRS true volume\" to equalize the audio to program level and nullify the high volume commercials that scream at you. The speakers do a nice job in a moderate size room (16' x 18' in this case). With a TV this size, however, most people will likely use a surround sound speaker set and mute the internal speakers.PHYSICAL: Very thin! I used the Chief LSTU Thinstall Universal Fixed Wall Mount for 37-63-Inch Displays (Yes, I cheated; the mount is for 63\" max, but the weight of this TV (72#) is well under the capacity (125#) of the mount). This mount preserves all the challenging Vizio engineering that was focused on getting the TV so thin in the first place. The E701i-A3 connects as expected to the VESA standard 400-mm x 400-mm hole spacing set using M6, 20mm screws. Thankfully, Vizio designed the cable input/outputs for vertical mount so the connections do not force the TV to set out from the wall on their account. The final look (with a thin mount) will fit that  \"picture like\" presentation that most of us desire. Connections to WiFi internet-delivered content is as easy as connecting a laptop, or notebook device. The supplied Vizio remote includes a very handy QWERTY keypad on its backside (for keying-in those annoying user names and passwords for: HULU, Netflix, Amazon, etc.) The TV does NOT support web browsing (which can legitimately be considered a negative). It is not a 3-D capable TV - nor does it claim to be!VALUE: At this price point it will be extremely difficult to see anything like >$1000 worth of \"better\" in ANY of its competitors. Maybe \"better\" is out there... but on a price-performance curve, this TV is so far above the \"knee\" of the curve that a bit \"better\" will come at a (questionably) high price. And, FWIW, Vizio did win the J.D.Powers highest brand loyalty survey. To review the hardware & functionality details for this model TV, download Vizio's PDF User Manual which can be easily found using this search string: \"E701i-A3 User Manual\".-----update-----PERFORMANCE: (3 Jan 2013) After a few weeks with the TV I am still impressed. With sports - the motion clarity is virtually indistinguishable from my 50\" Panasonic plasma. The LCD picture has a bit \"edgier\" rendition than the plasma, but still very appealing, especially for sports. I was pleasantly surprised how very well a streamed movie was rendered using the Vizio's \"Movie\" setting. A bit disappointed that the USB connection requires tipping a wall-mounted TV out on its mount \"kickstands\" to plug-in a flash drive.

Started using Netflix, YouTube, etc. immediately.  The picture is even better when watching videos from the net apps.... YES, even better!  I was stunned by the clarity of the app videos, and how well it streams media.  I did have to change the smoothing to Medium, as Harry Potter Deathly Hallows looked like a dark soap opera. That was the only setting that I needed to change from factory.  And the sound (w/o) external theatre sound was satisfactory.  I watched a TNF game and I had to turn around and look behind me as the built-in surround made the announcer in the stadium sound as if he were behind me (across the room from the TV).

We don't currently have cable so we purchased it mostly for its internet apps. They work very well. The biggest downfall using the apps is the TV remote. Since it is not a full QWERTY keyboard, typing in what you would like to watch can be annoying. We use the YouTube app a lot but searching can be a pain without the full keyboard. Luckily, we downloaded the YouTube remote controller app and are able to set up playlists from our phone once we have the YouTube app up and running on our TV. Great solution! We also use the Netflix app and have had some problems with it. Every once in a while the show we are watching freezes up and then after a few seconds our TV turns itself off. We think it is just the NetFlix app itself because we haven't encountered this problem when watching it through our Wii or Xbox. Other than those few problems the apps work fast and well. I will be looking into getting Amazon Prime soon so I am able to access their streaming videos as well. We have also tried using a USB drive to load movies and shows onto our screen as well. Tips for anyone doing this, the video files that this TV can read are avi. and mp4. You need to have the TV turned off when plugging in your USB drive in order for the TV to recognize the device, as well as turning it off before removing it. Plays videos well; we ended up purchasing a USB drive specifically for watching videos and movies on the TV. This TV does not recognize large external hard drives. We tried using our 1.5 TB hard drive but it was not registering on our TV.The picture quality is great, no complaints at all. I particularly love how thin the frame of the TV is around the screen; it gives you the most screen space possible. It is a bit bulkier in the back, not super thin as some TV's but it doesn't make a difference to me since no one is going to be looking at it from behind. All the hook ups are on the back and can be easily concealed. Power button, volume buttons and all other TV control buttons can be found on the left side of the TV. It took no time to install and set up our TV and it looks great! This TV really packs a punch with all it has to offer for it's price.

Haven't spent too much time with this set. I was upgrading from a 6 year old 42\" Hitachi Plasma set. The Hitatchi still looked pretty great, but I've been convinced for months, obsessing over waiting for the right deal. I was sure that I needed an LG or a Samsung; the two top dogs (imo) with a great selection of mid-high range sets within my budget ($1500) There were plenty of similar prices for quality sets; anything 55\" + TV set within the last year, some nice frills to boot was on the table.The timing of this set's release was just too perfect. I wasn't even considering a vizio, but all the sets by Samsung and LG are already 6+months behind). And Vizio deserves credit for really stepping it up. I saw the review on cnet and gizmodo and was quickly sold. It looks and feels like a spiffy new high-end television. Also going from 42\" to 60\" is more impressive than it may sound. The set itself also damn thin and not too heavy. Especially compared to the smaller hitachi.It's worth repeating, I had a negative connotation with Vizio as low end, bargain TV's from walmart. But I'm truly impressed with the feature set.... loads of inputs, wi-fi capabilities, netflix and amazon prime apps  (total snap to set it all up)... i'm still discovering more eatures as I play with it. As soon as I threw the set on I fired up the on the Step Brothers blu-ray it was noticably crisper than my old 1080i set.Now I have some minor nitpicking to do. Not dealbreakers, but just thoughts. For one, he stand does not swivel. My Hitachi had this swiveling stand, and it was a great feature depending on how many people were viewing. Also I hate the smooth motion settings. It just looks strange to me, like everything turns into a daytime soap. Thankfully I can turn it off. I can see it being nice for sports games, but movies and most tv shows throw me off with the movement. My buddy was saying he likes it better, so I guess that's gonna be a personal thing. I keep it set off. Also, the remote is not backlit. For all those buttons on there, it would have been great to make it easy on the eyes when all the lights are out.Menus themselves are rather deep with settings and features, yet intuitive to get to the simple stuff. I love that you can browse amazon prime on the sidebar without entering an app. This means whatever else you're watching changes aspect ratio and continutes to play, while you freely browse new content. I was a little overwhelmed with the amount of features and settings, but it's not difficult to change some basic picture settings and keep it simple.There's no other set at this price point, this solid, this new and with so many features. It's worth looking at, and I predict it will be a big seller in the holidays.I'll update my review again as I play around more. Still figuring stuff out.I can't believe I spent over $2300 on a 42\" plasma and only 5-6 years later, sets like these are not only better but like half price. Also i was jazzed this tv was 30% under my budget. This set is a steal for $1000. Great timing Vizio.***updates***one week later - still happy as can be. no buyers remorse. several friends are considering purchasing the same exact set. i am convinced this product will keep me happy years down the road.some questions to other ppl who bought this set (sound off in the comments) : - any thoughts on using a soundbar? gizmodo [...] just ran an article on top four under $300 and the top choice was a vizio soundbar for $225... worth it? speakers are pretty good as is, just want psuedo surround... i still have a sony receiver and 5 pc speaker with 5.1 dolby setup but honestly it's just a little cumbersome these days.- any previous vizio owners; do they update the built in apps often? would love to have HBO Go on here ;)- what defines HD on the netflix streaming? this might just be off topic, as it's probably relative to the netflix app more than the set... it looks pretty good, but i definitely see some rough pixels here and there. pressing info just says \"XHD\"- is there a way to lock the settings? my son keeps on turning real motion to mess with me and it's the worst.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broke in less than a week!", "Author": "Jorge Carral", "ReviewID": "R1V9N1LPHSEGTI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Watch out with this TV, you can see from other reviews that some of these just black out.

So this review covers initial impressions, ease of setup, etc.OK, I use this for a bedroom TV, using OTA (over the air) tv signal.  I also have the VIA (Vizio Internet Apps) functioning via WIFI.Packaging - box weighs about 15 lb, so this is light weight.  This can be good or bad, we will see.  Being light weight helps ensure safe shipping, so that is good.  Arrived from Amazon, via UPS, in good shape.Open to watching TV was probably 45 minutes - this included changing antennas (requiring 2 scans).  I pulled off foam blocks, removed from plastic bag, located the base and attaching screw.  The base is held on with a single screw, Allen wrench included.  Easy peasy.  Set on stand, attach power cord, put batteries in remote, connect antenna.On power up, asks for either home use, or store demo, what type of signal (cable or antenna), and then scans for channels.  The bedroom is on the second floor, and the antenna is a Mohu Leaf - so I was able to pull in plenty of stations, with very good signal quality.Next I setup Netflix, and Amazon Prime - this probably takes 15 minutes for both.  Typing in the passwords with the remote is tedious, but that is the same with all remotes, and long passwords.Initial impression of picture/sound quality - this is a 720p TV, so that considered, very good.  sound is fine, and allows external speakers.Price is very good, and overall value is high.  Vizio makes a great consumer level product, and this is no exception.I generally only give 5 stars to truly outstanding products, so you may find my 4 star rating a bit low.

But with VIZIO - specially with this specific model - it's great in every way, and still priced REALLY LOW - specially considering all the features included!I have always bought higher end TVs - by Samsung & Sony. They do deliver quality - but their prices are also on the much higher side. I needed to buy another TV - for my basement den/office. I did not want to spend much - as my primary TVs were in the living room & bedroom - both LEDs - one by Sony, one by Samsung. After checking out a lot of reviews - and even going to Wallmart / Bestbuy etc to actually watch this VIZIO playing side by side with other TVs, I decided to go for this TV.Well, to keep it short, this TV has EVERYTHING :- Superb Picture Quality.- Really pure Whites : Almost none of the low/medium price TVs are able to deliver proper whites. But this one produces really accurate whites.- Really deep blacks. OK - perhaps not AS deep as those high end LEDs with local dimming, but no casual viewer can tell the difference. I actually do look very carefully - but even I will not be able to casually notice the difference. Infact, when blacks are REALLY deep - there is a problem too - details in the dark areas of the picture are rendered completely black too - destroying picture details ....so I actually prefer a level of darkness not intensely black.- SMART TV Options : It has them all ! ....Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Prime, etc etc. The SMART OPTIONs INTERFACE is slightly slow to maneuver, but once the videos are started - they play flawlessly. Connecting to my wireless network was easy.- REMOTE : Well, if you are going to be extensively using the smart feature - for using with Youtube / Netflix etc - you may want to buy a remote which comes with a QWERTY keyboard on the reverse side. These are available really cheap - on Amazon or eBay. I bought a used one for just over $10 - and it works perfectly. The remote included has everything - but lacks the QWERTY keyboard.- SOUND : Sound is good - loud & clear - vocals are clearly heard. However, if you are seriously into great sound quality - you may want to buy & connect an additional sound-bar, or an external sound system.I set the picture to VIVID - with GAME MODE enabled. That got me the best picture quality as per my taste. You will have to play around with the settings for a while to get the right picture quality. Out-of-the-box settings are not optimum.120Hz is claimed - though it is not a true 120hz. I have SAMSUNG'S high end 120hz TV - and though there is a little difference in very fast motion - but you have to actually look for it to notice it.Overall - for approx $400 (including shipping!) - this is a SUPERB DEAL & a SUPERB TV !

Great service.  The Vizio has a very, very good picture even before tweaking.  I have seen no picture defects of any kind.  I only had to tweak the backlight, contrast, etc. to my liking.  I have ordered a set of Logitech Z-623 2.1 speakers to enhance regular operation, as my wife doesn't turn the Sony home theater receiver on except for DVD movies.  I can highly recommend the Logitech speaker system as I have the same model installed on my new Sony KDL55HX850 that I got from Sony to replace my old defective SXRD tv.  The picture is better on the Sony, but that model retails for about $2000 and is only 55\" in size.  The Vizio is far larger and produces an amazing picture at a lower price.

The design is simple and stylish, the bevel makes it great for wall mounting. Not to thick so as to distract you from the display itself, and not so thin you can't distinguish the image from the wall.Price wise it was a bargain. For the settings, 1080P and 120Hz, its worth it.My only issues with this item was the remote and the streaming/load times for the Smart HDTV features. Out of the box there is an initial setup that requires your name, wireless router connection, password input. The remote was not designed for this at all. There's a pop up keyboard that you have to use the remote to navigate, not fun.As for the Smart HDTV features a little on the slow side. Not streaming wise, but loading wise. Example: You click on HuluPlus/Netflix, it asks you if you'd like to start the application, and then it takes 30-45 seconds to load, once in the actual application responses are slow, the icons for various shows take time to load up, moving to another category takes time. Don't even attempt to use a \"Search\" option with the stock remote (lol). Once you find the movie you want it's great! It streams wonderfully (depending on your internet speed), the time you spend to get to that movie, not so wonderful.Now mind you. If you're buying this TV. You're still getting a GREAT, and I'm not kidding when I say GREAT, HDTV. If you seem like the person who's going to definitely want to utilize Smart HDTV features on a regular basis, consider seeing the item first and testing it out.Just to give everyone a reference point of where I'm coming from, and why I'm so critical of the Smart HDTV features. I from the beginning was planning to connect this HDTV to my PC as a 5th monitor. It takes 30-45 seconds to load up the Smart HDTV applications, my PC takes 8-16 seconds to boot up.With that being said though as an additional monitor, this thing PERFORMS.

The \"white gloves\" delivery service was excellent as well.Now, after 10 days of using the TV the only thing I can find to complain about is the physical size of the remote.  I'm an Olde Farte and have trouble seeing small print in dim light and using things with small keys.  The remote on this TV is one of the smallest I've ever seen and even has a full keyboard on the reverse side.  It is virtually impossible for me to read the labels over the buttons or use the keyboard but for younger users I don't think this would be a problem.Setup was a piece of cake and even network connections worked right out of the box.  I was able to connect and stream a Netflix movie and watched the entire thing without a single dropped frame or freeze.  I have 7mb DSL internet service.The picture is awesome.  Unfortunately, the Blu-ray player I ordered was caught up in Superstorm Sandy and hasn't yet arrived but HD picture quality over-the-air is almost 3D-like and does not fade or wash out in a bright room.A major surprise was the sound.  Most HDTV's seem to cheap out on the sound but this one seems much better than most.  I have it sitting on its stand on a wooden console and can hear the sound, crisp and clean, from 15 feet away.  I have the digital output connected to my A/V receiver but the additional sound quality comes mostly from the two woofers attached to that system.And that raises the only engineering complaint I have and would be true with the majority of HDTV's and that is the placement of the downward-facing connections.  The unit is so thin that connecting the optical output and HDMI inputs is difficult.  And seeing the various connections is almost impossible when the unit is placed on its stand.Overall I consider this unit an excellent value for the money (just under $1,000) and would recommend it highly.

I chose the 60\" size at a great price that beat competitors in the same segment. You get an unadorned relatively thin black bezel without the overuse of logos as you will find. The depth is pretty shallow. The HDMI inputs face down making wall mounting not a hassle. You're able to have the power LED indicator turn off while viewing so there's less distraction. Video games are very responsive to input with little to no lag (Playing Call of Duty: Ghosts currently on it). Picture quality is pretty good to the non-videophile (me) after some tweaking...especially the brightness levels which are initially blindingly bright. I do not regret my purchase.Now on to what most people reading these reviews is looking for: The negatives.panel uniformity is atrocious. This is to mean, on a black screen...the back-lit patches of light that will show through like dark grey splotches. This is something you won't notice unless you're watching a very dark movie/TV show. This varies from panel to panel, even among the same line of TV...I just happened to get what I got. At this price point, you will have some no matter what.The Apps are sorta hit or miss. Netflix works well enough and I have only encountered a few app freezes in a few months. Amazon GO app could use quite a bit of work as browsing movie titles is an exercise in reading very small print (App doesn't go fullscreen like Netflix). The other apps included are fluff for my uses. Could use a Spotify app like the Samsung units, and HBO GO! but that's nit picky.3-stars were given due to panel uniformity, medium picture quality, and Apps that work but aren't polished.I had to choose between screen size, price, and picture quality.

My mom bought this TV for us on August 31st. Approximately one month later, it would start to just randomly shut itself off then restart. I did some googling and discovered that this is a common issue for Vizio TVs. (We'll be sitting here watching Netflix or regular TV and all of a sudden the screen will go black then the \"V\" logo will appear and it will be on regular TV. It even logs me out of Netflix completely.) I tried unplugging the TV and holding down the power button and then plugging it into a different outlet. That didn't correct the problem. On October 26th, I sent an email to Vizio to request that they fix or replace the TV. They suggested doing the same thing I had already done (unplug, hold power button down, etc.). I tried that again and the TV went a whole 2 days without restarting.So I emailed them again on November 14th and they gave me a customer service number to call. I called that number today and the guy on the phone told me that it would take about 5-6 days to repair and they would send someone out. Then he realized that the TV would have to be sent in and was going to schedule that. So basically they wanted me to send in this defective TV and then sit here with no TV for the next two weeks while they fix it (one week for shipping back and forth, one week for repairs.) This isn't acceptable, especially for a product that apparently has this problem a lot and is clearly defective. It's a $250 TV. Shipping and repairing it would cost that much. I just want the stupid thing replaced. Why should we have to sit here and go two weeks without out when the problem is on their end?

Beautiful picture, no on/off issues, no buzzing... looks great and has solid connectivity (I've tried wired/wireless and both work just as well- however wireless strength decreases quickly at longer range).  I agree that it's the best deal out there for a 60 inch right now.  I love how light weight it is, and the \"razor thin\" screen edge/back.  The inputs/outputs are very nice.  This TV even has analog audio output (and dedicated digital audio and pc audio), with variable/fixed settings for those with older A/V Rcvr or stereo setups, and you can choose stereo, Dolby 5.1, etc.  I haven't tested all the sound capability however, but obviously you won't get HDMI sound quality without a newer A/V Rcvr, etc.  Having 4 HDMI ports is really nice with this setup.  -The HD picture quality is directly related to your broadband quality- no surprise.  Using the on board wireless connection with Amazon streaming for example, I have 1.5 MB DSL coming in- and the movie plays in a narrower \"widescreen\" format because my broadband quality is not high enough for pure HD.  However, if I hook up my Roku, the Amazon video plays across the entire/full screen.  It's still not pure HD quality, but I like the larger picture. I also prefer the Roku format for movies, etc. It offers more functionality/choice.  The VIA apps on the Vizio are nice, don't get me wrong, I just prefer the Roku for movies/choice. I really like the Vizio VIA Accuweather app with weather radar view and a few others.  Until I purchased the TV I did not realize that most of the VIA apps are based on the Yahoo Connected TV platform.  Take a look at that if you're curious, seems like a good strategy for Yahoo- but we'll see how they do over time.  -I really like the ability to go through the VIA apps on the left side of the screen while still watching TV- makes it great for games, etc.  The picture quality is easily configurable, and I'm still tweaking-  overall very satisfied with the picture.  Some folks say that fast-action sports can blur- but it has not been noticeable for our family- picture, games, etc are just fine.  -DLNA:  I haven't used it yet, but Vizio says \"Yes\" it is there- once you make your computer available for DLNA, it will show up in the Media Player App. I have used the Media Player app for USB pictures and video- that's pretty nice!  - Picture/Screen in Bright Room:  One of my criteria was a bright picture based on lots of windows/sunlight, etc.  This picture does very well in a brightly lit room, and has a matt screen with low reflectivity.  Even at night, the screen doesn't reflect much ambient lighting.  - Gaming: Have connected Wii through Component video/rca audio and works fantastic. Must have the component cable for the Wii, for example: eForCity HDTV / EDTV High Definition 480p Component AV Cable for Nintendo Wii .  Be sure to change the Wii settings for screen resolution.CONS:  -Before purchasing this TV I spoke with Vizio and was told that \"Yes, it has Skype\" as the advertisements imply.  But after I got it home, I found there is no Skype VIA app.  After setting up the TV, I then contacted Vizio once again- and the rep tried to again tell me it was functional with Skype- all I had to do was purchase the Vizio Skype Cam.  I told the rep he was wrong...and asked him to contact Tech Support because \"There is NO Skype VIA app.\"  He finally found out that his information was wrong, and that Vizio is still working on compatibility issues with this model TV and Skype, and anticipates a Firmware update \"sometime in the future.\"  I said that could mean a year or more- do they have an estimate?  The answer is \"No.\"  -If, and when, Vizio does come out with Skype- you must also use their camera only- it's not because they are trying to prevent other cameras; rather, there are specific compatibility criteria with Skype and particular TV's.  Your other option for Skype is to purchase the Vizio CoStar (Roku-like device), or a Skype compatible Blu-ray player, hook it up to your computer, etc.  For me however, Skype is a huge criteria, and I wanted it integrated into the TV.  Hence, I'm considering returning the TV, and their advertising is misleading.  I'm not convinced they will update the Firmware with Skype.  -VIA Apps:  While I like the VIA apps/flexibility, it's not easy to switch back and forth when you're fully IN a specific app to get back to tv, and then back to the App again.  In other words, say you are watching You Tube, and want to check the game on TV, you must select Input, then the TV or another port.  But then to get BACK to the VIA app, you have to go all the way through the apps again to load it- very time consuming.  You can't \"pause\" that YouTube video, check TV for the game, and then come back again to that same YouTube or the VIA app again quickly.  Perhaps I'm too picky... but it's a usability issue for switching back and forth easily while \"remembering\" your place on the VIA apps.  I would also love it if you could \"save favorites\" on the VIA apps individually, but again, I'm probably asking for too much at this point for a sub $1K HDTV.  - TV doesn't swivel, but that has not been an issue- it's light enough to move if you need to.

It's the first wifi enabled TV I've ever owned and but since I have minimal cable line-up there, I knew I'd be depending heavily on video streaming from Netflix and Amazon. Also, since there is only one HDMI port on this model, I wanted the wifi feature so I could use the HDMI port for a game system rather than a Roku.This is a slim profile television and the stand is one that attaches from the back rather than underneath so it only needs 14 1/2\" headroom. It measures slightly over 22\" wide and about  6 1/2\" deep with the stand attached.The ports on the back of the TV include 1 HDMI port, 1 USB port, 1 RF port, 1 RGB PC port for connecting to a computer or laptop, Composite and Component ports, 1 Ethernet port, a coax cable port, a headphone jack and a 5.1 digital optical jack.It features 1080p resolution and is 60Hz. It has an LED screen and is plenty bright. The picture is crisp and the colors vibrant. It's a little slow changing channels and even slower using the internet apps but I'm not surprised given the price. The menu system is well done and easy to navigate.The remote is of the short and wide variety, which I like, and is comfortable in your hand. It had dedicated Amazon, Netflix and M-GO buttons also. Unlike larger versions of this TV, there is no keyboard on this remote. Instead, an onscreen keyboard pops up during setup for things like entering your wireless network name, passwords, etc. There is no back lighting on the remote.There is no users manual included. Instead there is a Quickstart Guide which walks you thru basic setup and then directs you to the onscreen users manual. I usually prefer a printed owners manual but this actually makes sense as you can't lose it.Vizio has it's own streaming video apps called VIA, just as Roku has \"channels\". There is a VIA button in the center of the remote which brings up an onscreen dock with all the pre-installed apps. You can also add more apps by opening the Yahoo! Connected TV Store App.I believe this TV would be best suited to a bedroom, office or kitchen with a wireless network available and and would be a great solution where there is not much space and no cable television service. My only disappointments are that it only has one HDMI port and it's slow to respond to the remote, although that's not a huge issue to me considering the price.

I would recommend this TV to anyone, so long as they are aware of two key possible shortcomings:1) The viewing angle.  Rather than the traditional pedestal stand, this TV stands more like a picture frame, and rests on a triangular foot attached to the back.  The configuration causes the TV lean back a few degrees, rather than being perpendicular to the table top.  This causes no issues if the TV is viewed at eye level or below, but when the TV is above eye level the angle causes a very significant degradation of perceived image quality.  In my case, I purchased it for the bedroom, and with the TV just a few inches above the bed, the image quality was terrible due to the angle.  My solution was to purchases a $20 tilting wall mount to compensate.2) Only one HDMI input.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Except for Wireless", "Author": "metalheadjc", "ReviewID": "R2U0NC4AABBAB0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will start with the good and work my way down:-Style:  This is one of the more stylish small TVs I have come across.  The frame is very thin around the screen, as you can see in photos, so it looks pretty nice.  It is not the thinnest TV ever, but it is still pretty thin and the connections on the back are vertically positioned, so you can place it back against a wall easily.-Built-in web apps:  There are quite a few to choose from, though for me the most important are Netflix, Amazon Video, Youtube, and Pandora.  There are a host of other random things that I have little use for.  The functionality is pretty much the same as I have seen on Roku, and it is nice to have all of that built into one device and on one controller.-Sound:  The speakers are surprisingly loud for such a small TV.  They are relatively clear as well.  Don't mistake this to mean that there's exceptional bass or highs or that it simulates surround well, or anything magical, it simply produces loud and clear stereo that is more than sufficient for a large bedroom, which is all I needed.-Picture:  Clear and bright, although there are a few jagged edges at times and the color depth does not quite compare to my Sumsung 50A550 50\" Plasma.  Then again, not much does.  Perhaps with some tweaking I can make it a bit better.  Overall, unless you're pretty picky and have a high-end TV to compare to, I don't think you will be disappointed.  It is sharp and overall looks good.-Tuner:  Seems to pick up most of the channels in my area (over the air) but does not pick up as well as my Samsung.  They both use the same rooftop antenna and the same signal booster and actually the Samsung's cable run is longer and goes through more devices but it does a better job of picking up weak channels.  However, only the very weakest channels (40 miles away) are dropped, so I'm relatively pleased.Now for the reason that it gets a 4 and not a 5:-Wireless connectivity:  This TV has built-in wireless.  If you look at the instructions that come along with the TV though, you are basically informed that it is preferred to use a wired connection.  I had no problem going through and setting up the TV to connect wirelessly to my router, and it seemed to connect just fine.  I pulled up Netflix and browsed through and everything was fine.  But I discovered that after 10-20 minutes of watching anything on Netflix or Youtube, the connection would drop and the built-in wireless would crash.  It would not come back until I turned the TV off and back on again, sometimes not even coming back until I had unplugged and replugged the power cable.  Pretty annoying.  Not sure if its a problem with firmware or hardware.  Certainly not a problem on my end.  I run an Asus RT-N66U router and a Cisco DPC3010 modem, neither of which gives me any trouble (as they shouldn't, they are both pretty expensive devices) and all of my other devices (PS3, two laptops, two phones, and a wireless printer) are all maintaining perfect connections.  So I ended up having to use a spare router as a wireless bridge and hook the TV to it with a cable, and now everything works great, but it was a pain to set up.My overall impression is that this is a good TV.  For the price, you simply cannot beat the features, but if all of the features do not work, are you getting the best deal?  For me it was fixable with what I had at home, but if this is a problem with all of these units, you may not have all of the features you are promised.  I can only hope this is an isolated issue.  If it isn't a risk you are willing to take, you may consider getting a similar, less expensive Vizio TV with none of the internet apps and internet connectivity features and just spend 50 bucks on a low-end Roku.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesomeness!", "Author": "B.

The picture on it is very good, and everything works like it should, with the exception of the Internet.My other choices are to hard wire ( not very practical as the router is in another part of the house) or send it back.  Maybe I can just buy another Roku.Gave it 5 for the picture, 3 1/2 for sound and 3 for everything else.UPDATE: 04/21/13Ok, I have had this TV for about 4 days now.  I had a bit of time to play with it yesterday and today.  I fiddled around with the sound and have it much more acceptable.  I also have messed with the color and have it pretty much right on.  But the biggest thing I corrected was the internet settings.To get the TV to login to your router, you need to change your router settings.  Instead of WPA2, set the settings toWPA-PSK [TKIP] + WPA2-PSK [AES].  If you change it to just WPA-PSK, it will not use the full speed of the router.Once I made the changes to the router I went into network settings on the TV and I had to manually input the router name (SSID) but then the rest was easy and it connected quickly to the VIA interface.I also changed my ratings on the TV to 4 stars total.  I would have given it 5 stars but they do not explain to you in the setup process about the router.UPDATE: 05/05/13I have had this TV for about 3 weeks now and am very impressed by it.  Color and picture is as good as any I have seen in the big box stores.  Only complaint I might have is the remote, but Amazon sells qwerty keyboard remotes for $20 or less and I might try one of those.As far as complaints from others about how long it takes to turn on,I have a 6 or 7 year old Sharp and it takes about that amount of time to come on as well.And complaints about the Internet connectivity, I think a lot of that comes down to your ISP feed speed and router.

P. Linke\" customer review stated, I had it under a month, the screen went blank (but the backlighting and sound still worked). I read many other reviews about the same thing happening to many other users and physically drove and talked to the store associate at Walmart, he said that he has seen many other Vizio's come back with the same issues or another within the last month. Decided on all the information that I gathered that the higher percentage rates of failure for this brand was not worth \"the hassle that many other users have gone through in the past\". Due diligence to yourself and read what others have gone through, and find the best deals of TV's that WILL LAST LONGER. I returned my unit to Walmart and read good reviews on a Panasonic that they had displayed for \"around\" the same price. Went to Sams Club were they had the same TV for $100.00 off and included a 3 year warranty for only $60.00 (paid for by the money that was saved). The Panasonic only has a 2% failure rate instead of Vizio's 4%. Plus Panasonic makes there own parts instead of buying them from a major label and only buying enough for a production run like Vizio does. All TV manufacters will have problems here and there but look for the ones that have the least amount of issues that will also not give you the run around if you did for future reference.  Consumer Reports data indicates that most major brand flat panel sets have a 2-5% failure rate within the first 3 years, but the overwelming amount of set failures do occur before the factory warranty ends. So if you spend a small amount of time educating yourself before you buy, you might just save yourself a couple of hours, days and/or weeks of getting the run around from companys that only focus on the bottom dollar and not the consumers money and dedication to there brand (like so many commited users have found through long waited discriminating experiences). I think you might have bought a TV for the purpose of entertainment, not the negative opposite of waiting for a replacement, repair or run around from the brand that was supposed to last with your hard earned money.

No fuss with the set up of the base or putting it up on a shelf.  It fires up quickly and without drama.  We plugged in our HDMI components and were off in no time.  One downside, while naming the inputs we had to use a slow onscreen keyboard.  The worst - some genius set up the keyboard alphabetically.  Really?  Why do some manufactures insist on doing something so illogical when most of us use QWERTY all day long?Other than the typing the set up was quick and painless.  Getting online was also easy.  We love that we can even connect to our Plex Media Server using a Vizio widget.  Overall the widgets and their layout are not as smooth as our ROKU2 XS for online materials but if one is really disinclined to shifting to a different input it'll work.Remote's a mishmash of buttons.  Seems like an engineer designed it and did not consult with anyone about ergonomics.  No backlighting, mostly uniform button design = obnoxious in the dark.  The most annoying thing...no sleep button?  Come on, a TV this small is really going mostly in bedrooms so why can't the designer be considerate and put sleep right there or make it really easy to access?  Overall it'll work but we're going to get another Harmony for the room so we can use the Directv, Roku and this TV easily on one remote.More important, to me, than the online/widgets, would be the crisp, clear sound.  At a volume setting of only 10-11 the TV's sound is bright and nothing is muddled (unlike that horrendous Panasonic).  Ah, good sound reproduction for such a cheapo TV.The picture quality also seems several notches above the Panasonic.  We needed very little fiddling to get to a nice image with deep blacks.

Every year as prices drift lower we get closer and closer to CES, new (better) sets, etc.  And so the cycle repeats. I always eyed the top of the line (eg VT Panny plasmas, Sony HX, and more recently the 70\" Elite). I even (pre)ordered a few before getting cold feet. I always found it tough to spend $5000 or more for a set with notable flaws, and which were soon to be replaced. Nature of the beast, but so be it.This time around though, with prices on 70\" and 80\" sets drifting down into crazy land, I felt more compelled than ever. Then the 60\" version of this set got a solid review on CNet. And then the 70\" was discounted for Black Friday. I couldn't hold out any more. I pulled the trigger and am very happy that I did.Delivery did not go as expected. Only one guy showed up so I had to help him carry it in, etc.  Amazon gave me a credit to make up for this.  Next, 2 of the 3 screw holes used to attach the base seemed out of plumb, and unfinished. It took a LOT of patience and elbow grease to get it attached without stripping the screws. Once done though, no issues. I'd probably recommend wall mounting but I have a nice stand and reasonably well behaved kids!I started with the CNet settings and tweaked from there using the Disney WOW blu ray. The picture quality was exactly as expected: very very good.  Short of state of the art, especially wrt black levels and off axis viewing (compared to the Elite and VT50) however I paid 1/3 the current price of the Elite and 1/2 the current price of the VT50.I then had to gently rub the screen to help alleviate the uneven backlighting. Do so at your own risk of course. I used a micro fiber and it worked surprisingly well. I still have a touch of unevenness but it's not at all noticeable with regular content on the screen. Only on a full back screen, or occasionally in extremely dark movie scenes.This set is an incredible value. I don't care about 3D, I don't care about the streaming apps (I use a PS3 for that), I don't care about the built in speakers, and I solved the lip sync issues (see the AVS forum thread...) using the delay on my receiver.All in all an incredible value. I'd prefer to give it 4.5 stars but Amazon won't let me. I can't give it 5 simply because there are sets that outperform it.

It's just a waste of components. Here are the issues I had:- Horrible light bleeding, not only from the edges (somewhat common with LCDs), but a huge section of the middle. Watching anything remotely dark looked awful.- Audio out of sync. Watching digital video from netflix or via my home network wasn't a possibility because of a very noticeable delay between the dialogue and lips of the actors.

I spent time in the menu attempting to correct the issue through setting adjustments but it is not possible. You'll see others had the same issue in other reviews. I wish I had read them before I bought it on Black Friday.- I re-adjusted the stand twice, ensuring that it was secured tightly and properly. The tv still leans back at an angle, which I believe was straining the panel and would eventually warp it.I use a PS3 for my streaming but I should mention to potential buyers that the \"smart apps\" are incredibly sluggish. A dollar store android tablet moves more fluidly than the app menus on this TV.The only positive I take from this experience is my new-found appreciation for my old Sony Bravia. Dynamic contrast ratio is a meaningless statistic. This tv claims to have a 1,000,000:1 DCR while my 3 year old Sony has 100,000:1. Comparing the contrast and black levels between the two is a joke. I realize how fantastic the Sony actually looks now that I spent a week trying to watch the Vizio.Those planning to order ANY TV from Amazon should read the following:I have to comment on the delivery carrier CEVA Logistics, which Amazon employs to deliver TVs. This is the most unprofessional company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I stayed home all day waiting for delivery and as the 5pm window passed, I called the company to confirm that the set would still be coming. I was informed that the driver was running a little behind and should make it to my home by 10PM. He did not and the following day I received a phone call from my grandparents whom he had contacted after finding their number in the local phone book. In the process of accepting and attempting to return this TV, I have corrected both Amazon and CEVA on the phone number at least four times. When I finally spoke to the driver, I had to give him step by step directions to my house as if we were executing a CraigsList deal. I later asked CEVA if the drivers have GPS and was told that they ordinarily do not, unless the driver chooses to buy their own or use a smartphone. THIS IS A DELIVERY COMPANY THAT DOES NOT EQUIP THEIR DRIVERS WITH GPS! Are you serious??After setting up the Vizio and learning of all its defects and shortcomings, I initiated a return with Amazon on December 17th, 2012. As of January 2, the TV still sits in the box at my home and I'm awaiting a return phone call on the 4th to schedule a pickup thankfully via another carrier. CEVA has scheduled a return pickup 3 TIMES and not only failed to show up, but let me wait for them without so much as a phone call to inform me they weren't coming. Each time I call, it's as if they have no database to retrieve my information and are sifting through paperwork. It's a complete joke of a company and I will never buy a large item through Amazon again if I have to deal with CEVA.Bottom line: Yes it would be great to have a 60\" TV, but if you have $1K to spend on a set, go with a slightly smaller Sony, Samsung, Panasonic or LG. You get what you pay for. Do not buy a TV from any online store that does not have a physical location near your home. I've learned my lesson. Yes, you may save money on shipping, but you had better hope that the TV works flawlessly and you never have to return it. If you have to deal with CEVA it could be an absolute nightmare. Also, make sure you have someone in your family who is free to sit at your house and needlessly spend 3-4 days waiting on them to show up.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Get 'Smart' about the missing qwerty remote before you buy", "Author": "Librarius42", "ReviewID": "R27ODK0SS22PYL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the 24\" version (VIZIO E-Series E241i-A1) of this TV, and while it is good value for the money, there are some serious drawbacks you need to be aware of. First, the sound quality is pitiful. The speakers are smaller than most tweeters, and the sound they produce is hollow and tinny. There is no bass volume whatsoever. If you want full sound, plan to hook up a receiver or a set of computer speakers and make sure they have an optical connector for digital sound. Secondly, there is both missing information and misinformation on the Amazon page regarding the remote control. The remote control has NO qwerty keyboard. This was a big deal for me. I bought this TV specifically to use Netflix, and guess what? When I tried to login to my Netflix account I could input my user name, but I couldn't input my password because there was no on-screen keyboard. I was dead in the water.When I contacted tech support on the Vizio website, they repeated said that an on-screen keyboard would pop up. It didn't. When I asked if there was a qwerty remote I could buy, they said \"There is NO qwerty remote for this TV.\" I was about ready to send the TV back when I decided to try one more time. Being a puzzle solver, I went back to the Netflix screen and reversed the sequence. I put the password in first and the user name second. It worked. I got an on-screen keyboard both times. Lastly, there ARE qwerty remote controls offered on Amazon for this TV. So my question to Vizio is why on earth would you offer an 'smart' internet ready TV with loads of APPs that require qwerty input, but not include a qwerty remote? That is just plain cheap and dumb marketing. And why would you deny that such remotes exist when they are for sale on Amazon? Wake up!

It was ludicrous, we thought.  Then I started looking at LCD TV's.  I knew I didn't want/need 3D, so that eliminated a bunch, and I knew I wanted at least 60\".  I looked at Sharp, Samsung and others, but not at Vizio.  I'd been warned that they were \"cheap\" and didn't look as good.Then, the joking got serious, and I started honestly looking for a 70\" TV.  When I realized my mounting area was exactly the size for a 70\", we went for it.  The only choices were Sharp and Vizio.  Sharp had four different models, all of varying reviews.  Didn't want 3D, didn't need this, didn't want that - and the prices were all $2K or more.  Still a steep jump for us.  Then there was this Vizio...I started reading more and more reviews - Vizio was stacking up well against Sharp.  And the price was $500 less!!  Finally, we jumped and went for the Vizio.  Ordered it from Amazon and a week later, two very polite guys showed up in a truck and carried it into my living room.  I used the mount I purchased off Amazon and with the help of a buddy, hung it on the wall and hooked it up to the Yamaha surround system I also got on Amazon.  BOOM!!  Instant home theater (and the biggest one on the block) for under $2K.  (Thanks, tax return!)I am an audio visual person by profession - and I must say I have been very impressed by the picture of the Vizio.  Looks great!!  Easy to use - easy to navigate.  I wish the remote had backlighting, but for the price I paid, I'm not going to complain.  I got the 5 year warranty for another $150 or so and I am confident that I'll have 5 years of great viewing ahead of me.  Love the TV - picture is crisp and clear and the HD is awesome.

I'm hooked up to WIFI with the router across the house, but I can search for any video I want to stream in full 1080p. --(still YouTube's flash HD - I'm picky, but it still looks very very good)Other apps - I do not have a streaming Netflix account anymore due to it's selection, but it and the other apps look promising. Being a WIFI television I was hoping to stream my music, videos and pictures through DLNA. I have not tried this yet but after looking through the Vizio apps, it looks very possible.Speakers - I have a 321 Bose 2.1 System outputting through the Vizio's optical port. But when I was first setting up the television, I did notice that the built-in speakers were adequate. I would not be disappointed.The remote...works.  This is the only thing I'm going to complain about. Using the qwerty remote on the backside takes some getting used to. It's a little laggy when typing and in my short experience, it has to be pointed the right way at the TV to get any reception.User-Interface - In no way is this a 4ghz PC with 8 gigs of RAM. It's a TV. The menu's and apps are big graphical animations and are a little jittery moving around the screen, but they are again adequate. This is not something that would drive me away from a purchase but something just to note.The size - I have quite a big mantle above the fireplace so I decided to mount it above -- it was the right decision. I found a low-profile, 12-degree wall mount also on Amazon that hugs this thing to the wall. The most it sticks out is about 3-4 inches for a 60in TV.

We are very pleased with the whole experience from Amazon's delivery (which was free under Amazon Prime and deferred the entire annual cost of the program), the easy setup, TV features and picture quality.  Setup took less than half an hour, about one fourth the time it took me to assemble my artificial Christmas tree (Reviewer warning: I lack any mechanical instincts whatsoever). Poking around in the manual and exploring a blizzard of features can become a hobby if one wants to go that route.  I'm no expert on resolution and picture quality, but we also have an expensive Samsung 46\" TV, which is now in the bedroom believe it or not, and the Vizio compares favorably to that one.  I think this obsession with pitcture quality on newer HDTVs is overblown given that these debates are focused on differences undetectable by the human eye, or at least these old eyes.  Also, you can just program in whatever display settings you want using Vizio's predefined settings or expert profiles available on the web.  If you want purple people or orange leaves, go right ahead.  The apps and wireless connection are idiotproof, but we use them less that other folks because of our desktop/Vizio connection (see below).My wife and I were a little leery of getting such a large TV (70\") given the size of our family room.  Turns out the TV viewing from 9' away is quite enjoyable.  My wife views the TV from the side and at a 30 degree angle and the picture is fine. The matt finish performs well diffusing normal household reflections.One unique thing about our setup is that I have the Vizio connected to our Windows desktop computer in another room.  Consequently, we use the Vizio as the world's largest computer display.  We have remote computer speakers and a wireless keyboard/trackpad in the family room and surf the web from the couch to our hearts content.  The Windows graphics adapter in the desktop computer drives the Vizio TV in HD mode so streaming TV shows and movies look and sound great.  Consequently, we don't really use the Vizio apps much since we access Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pandora, HBOGO, NBC/CBS/ABC/TNT TV sites, etc via the Windows machine and Internet Explorer in the other room.  This setup works very well.  We hardly have use for the DVR.  Also, browsing the internet on a 70\" screen is a trip!All in all, the Vizio E701i-A3 is an easy to use,  high-quality, fully featured and versatile TV.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yes, yes, yes, YES!", "Author": "Charles Dickens", "ReviewID": "RAT4IHQI9CCE6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Based on the extremely positive reviews here, I returned a Samsung UN55ES7500 for this and I am extremely glad I did - 5\" bigger and less than half the price.- Installing the stand required the use of a power screwdriver, because the screws were very hard to turn after about half way in.  For some reason the delivery guys refused to help me with this (I thought that was part of the deal with buying a large TV from Amazon?).  However, the TV is relatively light so I managed to do it single-handed.  Without the power screwdriver it could have been a problem though.- Setup was a breeze, as pointed out, choose \"HOME\" not \"STORE\" on the very first screen.- I made some adjustments to the TV settings, turning off smooth motion as suggested in other reviews here, then played with the colors until they were to my liking.  I can't see any difference in quality to the Samsung UN55ES7500 I returned.  Viewing is perfectly fine too, at wide angles.  Perfectly fine for any normal family basement/living room!- The remote is brilliant because it has a QWERTY keyboard on the back.  Unlike some other reviewers, I had no problems with the angle it was pointed at, the TV always could receive signals from it (despite it being IR, not Bluetooth).  This makes such a difference when entering user names, searching for things etc.- DNLA works like a charm!  I was able to watch videos and view photos from my Windows 7 PC via the \"media\" app.  My only gripes are (1) you are limited to the video and audio codecs that the TV has, with no opportunity to install your own (2) it does not start a video where you left off, and (3) you are limited to fast forwarding at an annoyingly slow speed, so restarting half-way through is a real pain.  (Side note: after I added some new media to my Windows PC the TV wasn't listing it, I thought it was because the TV did not have the required codecs, but that was not the case, it was actually a problem with Win7 - search Google for \"DLNA in Windows 7 64 bit - newly added files not available on devices\" to find the solution - I did what it said there, and the media showed up!).  After a couple of weeks of use, I decided to invest in a Roku and the free Plex app to stream my media to my TV - this means that the video/audio is decoded on the PC and therefore any media at all can be played on the TV.- The CNET review mentioned the basicness of the UI, but I actually really like it and find it far more sensibly laid out than the Samsung I returned, which I found to be too busy and confused.  I like the way that you can browse Amazon Instant Video while watching TV.  There is a dedicated button on the remote for Amazon and Netflix which is nice, and one for \"M-Go\", which I will never use and in fact uninstalled. I wish that could have been reprogrammed for the \"Media\" app.  The Facebook and Twitter apps also operate while allowing you to watch TV (note if you have apps turned off in Facebook you won't be able to log in from the TV - took me two TVs and a long time to figure that out).- I have not noticed any lip sync issues yet (either from cable TV, or from DNLA) but the TV does allow you to adjust the synchronicity, haven't used it so can't comment on its effectiveness.  ** UPDATE ** after a few weeks of usage, I am now starting to notice the dreaded lip sync issue, both from cable TV and while watching my Roku.  Switching inputs seems to reset it again.- Startup does take about 10 seconds (minor annoyance in my opinion)- Sound is a little bit tinny, I have invested in a sound bar to complement it.- I read some concerns somewhere about the stand not being wide enough, and the possibility of the TV tipping over.  It does not require much leverage applied to the top of the TV to pull it over, and I do think that a small child could achieve this if they were set on doing it, or tried to climb up it/hang off the front.  Whether or not it's heavy enough to seriously injure them though is a different question - it is so much lighter than CRTs were, or even older LCDs, so I suspect not, but obviously it all depends on what hits where.The bottom line is that I think it's a better value for money to spend less on the TV and then buy a $50-$150 media streaming app which is much more cost effective to replace down the line if something better comes along, than replacing a whole TV.Google \"Vizio E601-A3 Owners Thread\" for some other useful info by people who have purchased (or who want to purchase) this TV.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Wilson x4", "ReviewID": "R19144X44POG8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this t.v. yesterday from Costco for 979.99.

Has great picture. No wow here.Two hugh disappointments are: One; the internet connectivity is through a Yahoo interface except for Netflix. This means all the great content now available on the internet is funneled through Yahoo. You might say so what. Well use this Yahoo interface for a short time and you'll discover that it's extremely difficult to use. Why? The strongest negative is the fact that it's only displayed on the left third of the screen which makes it cumbersome to to view. Now don't forget this is a 60\" TV and it's still unacceptable to me to utilize only 33% of the screen. What was Visio thinking. At least give an option to expand the Yahoo interface size. Try viewing Amazon Prime videos like that and when you do Yahoo/Visio does not allow you to view your \"watchlist\" to play your pre-chosen video... REALLY!! I find that I will no longer use the Yahoo interface. As stated earlier Netflix views full screen because it does not view through the Yahoo portal. The whole Yahoo interface makes the Wifi almost worthless!!!Now the second disappointment; When Visio does a software update, (which it does automatically and you can't stop it) it wipes out all your settings.... Yes It wipes all your wireless internet settings, all your Yahoo interface settings and Netflix password settings. All your passwords for each individual app and Wifi settings will be lost. It took me over an hour to re-install all the passwords. This sucks and I just won't do it again! Why would you design an HDTV that wipes all your setting every time a software update is done. This is not new technology and one would think they would have field tested this HDTV. Guess not. Then while you are using the keypad side of the remote to speed re-entry up you will find the darn thing is rather intermittent and you have to sit right in front of the TV to get it to work somewhat.I have two Visio HDTV's and don't think I will be buying another.

Not Bass heavy, but for its purpose, the speakers are plenty good....If I need true Cinema quality sound...I'll go to the mancave for 7.1...All in all, I likely should have just purchased a more basic-non-smart TV and saved money since I was unimpressed by the Apps. They would likely work better in a wired Ethernet connection...but that port is blocked by the mounting plate...  Not exactly Vizio or Amazon's problem...but it factors in to my rating.

I did some quick research and noted numerous complaints regarding this model experiencing the same problem -- seems to happen to a lot of these TVs bought over the 2012 holidays.I contacted Vizio the next day and found out they have a customer support team specifically set up to handle this now well-known problem -- pretty much admitting it is something they expect. When I explained what happened they immediately offered a choice of maintenance support in 3-5 days, or they would ship a new one in 8-14 days. No questions asked. I didn't want to go through this again in a few months so I asked how they are addressing the problem on the newer models now, specifically the one they would send us. They said they have changed out the questionable boards on this model so I opted for a new replacement to be delivered and am currently awaiting shipment.As for the TV itself, when it was working prior to the failure, set up was easy and the picture was excellent, except for some pixelation during fast action. I'm not sure if some of that was due to the board or if that is common with this TV. The sound is adequate only, so I connected it through a receiver so I get surround sound watching movies or playing video games.

There are already plenty of reviews here on this TV so I won't make another repeat except for the fact that I love it.

You can take a nap waiting for the tv to turn on. Again this was all acceptable for the price.Now for the disaster. Ive owned this tv for 9 months now. One month ago the Tv began Flickering and having lines going through it bad. Like 50% of the screen. Not all the time. It has its moods. Some days normal. Other days when im already in a bad mood it is as well. You all can relate to that. Anyways I monitored it for a week and then called Vizio as Im under there standard warranty for purchaseing a tv. Well first they make me check this and that power cord etc and nothing worked. Then they went on to the cable box being the issue. So I say my dvd player does it as well. Either way that phone call went no where. Followed there steps being re-assured everything would be ok if we just did things step by step. So I did the cable box and even went as far as to have my cable tech speak with them over the phone while he was here.After finally admitting that it could be one of many different problems like main board, this circuit or that....blah blah it was basically a defect in there tv. So they tell me they will fix it for free. Well heres the real kicker. I have to MAIL the tv back to them. Now two problems. One I live in a small house so i was unable to save the tv box it was shipped in. And two I have to pay to SHIP the tv to them. That is not the kind of service I expect from a company that I just spent 750.00 on one of there products.

I'd like to be but those cards weren't dealt my way so allow me to go boldly forward with a consumer review from one not gifted with electronic wizardly traits.  The Vizio has replaced my old rear projection Mitsubishi 65\" model that bit the big one after about 10 years of service.  I chose the 70\" Vizio as I choose most of my major purchases and that is, which can provide me the most bang for the buck?  (See UPDATE below that explains a flaw in this purchase and thinking).  Also, UPDATE #2 is most telling.After checking out the marketplace, it came down to the following manufacturers:  Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp and Vizio.  I gave $1600 for the Vizio, or $400 less than the Sharp and over a thousand under the 65\" offerings of Panasonic and Samsung.  Still, I wanted to be sure the Vizio would hold up, offer up an excellent picture and be easy to use.  (See Update #2)Setting up the Vizio was relatively easy or should I say, without frustration.  As was the case with the Panasonics, I had to calibrate the picture settings to my liking right away.  The standard setting picture on the Vizio was weak and washed out in my view but this was quickly corrected by going through and adjusting the various settings for color temp, picture preference (I choose VIVID), reds, greens, blues and many other settings.  I experimented until I got exactly what I wanted: A picture that POPPED off the screen to the point where it looks as if you're looking through an open window at the offerings.I was also able to tie the Vizio into my home wireless network and checked it out through one of the loaded internet sites, YouTube in this case, and was rewarded with good access.  I was a little miffed that the Vizio failed to come with a web browser installed, nor did it have Skype loaded in but no big deal.  Still, those would have been nice to have.  Getting my Directv remote synched with the Vizio was also easy and without drama.  The true test will be over time but for now, I have a MAJOR ISSUE with this TV!  (See update #2)8 MONTH UPDATE:There's an annoying and repeating problem of sorts with the TV in that it fails to consistently hold a signal or picture consistently.  It doesn't happen all that often but will blink at you every hour of viewing a few times, that is, the picture freezes-goes black-then returns all within a second or two.  The Vizio is set up just like my other 3 TVs in the house which include two Panasonics and a Samsung.  None of the other TVs has this issue so it leaves me with the opinion that there's something defective in the inner workings of the Vizio, perhaps inferior video boards or wiring?  Other than that, the picture is first rate, and the TV grabs onto wireless offerings such as Netflix without issues MOST of the time.I say MOST, because I find myself having to re-set the access code to my home wifi every 4-6 weeks with the Vizio.  Given a choice again, based on my experience, I'd probably go with a different brand and pay $500+ for the honor.  The Vizio is an 'OK' TV but the others like the Panasonics and Samsung in my home have set the quality bar too high for the Vizio to match.  Be advised.UPDATE #2:I'm now sadly convinced that buying this TV was a mistake!  It won't hold a signal, continually turns itself off and sometimes takes 5-10 minutes before it will turn back on.  I've re-set the TV per instructions by unplugging it, holding the power button on the TV to the on position for 30 seconds, plugging it back in and thus re-setting it to manufacturer's specs which works for a short time before reverting back to its unceremoniously secession of power trick.  The Vizio tech reps run away from you when pressed for an answer on this or any other issue, so what I have is a very expensive boat anchor.I don't expect Vizio to be in the marketplace much longer or, to re-brand itself with another name in order to continue their fleecing of the consumer buying public.

This tv has very slight bleeding,almost unnoticeable.-TV Start-up time is about 10seconds-Limited apps that can be installed, and browsing through app menus is sometimes time consuming.Overall, I am happy with the purchase.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect For Me", "Author": "Anne Heath", "ReviewID": "R3L2WKSFA07PQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV was delivered in less than 48 hours, with not a scratch.

BOTH of which the Vizio COMPLETELY fails at.WIFI:Even when it works it sucks.  Don't even try blaming my home network router or anything else.  I have dozens of different wifi capable devices that all run FLAWLESSLY on my wifi.  I have a very high end wireless network and the Vizio WIFI is complete garbage.  This is a regular complaint.

The apps are as basic as they could be with little to no information about programs, previous episodes or anything.  Seriously, VIA is complete junk.  There is no comparison between the app quality of VIA compared to apps on platforms like Xbox, PS3 or ROKU.  They are LIGHT YEARS behind.Quality of product in general stinks.  My unit has shown to be defective after just one evening of use.  My only huge regret beside buying the tv in the first place is not buying it from Amazon.Should have gone with my initial gut feeling and spent $50 more and purchased a NON smart Samsung TV and the ROKU 3.

REVIEWThe T.V. out of the box didn't have the greatest picture the colors were kinda off and they didn't seem naturalThere was significant back lighting bleed through during start-up but it wasn't noticeable while watching programs except very slightly during real dark scenes.I also had the lip synch issue which was really bad on certain channels. I bought a AVR ( receiver) and ran everything to my receiver then from the receiver to the T.V. . This seemed to have improved/fixed the lip sync issue but this isn't practical for everyone.I decided to try some picture settings I found on AVS FORUM after a little adjusting I was satisfied with the picture quality.BOTTOM LINEIt is unacceptable for a T.V. to fail within 40 days, Lip synch issues are unacceptable, bad internet apps/ processing slow.

I wanted something that supported DLNA as I have a media server with rips of our DVDs & Blu-ray purchases.Overall the TV is very nice.  The presets aren't too bad, and once you turn off the adaptive backlight control the picture can be really nice.  The one place where this panel can struggle is in really dark scenes, where even with all the noise & artifact reduction set to the max, you'll still see the noise in the background.  It's definitely more noticeable compared to the Samsung 47\" LCD we have in the living room.  It doesn't make it unwatchable and after about 2 weeks with the TV I am noticing it less, but likely only because I'm getting used to it.  In bright colorful scenes, this TV is absolutely gorgeous and you'll be pleased to have it, when watching dark shows like The Following, there will be scenes that are hit or miss.  Sound is actually pretty decent for these super thin TVs coming out now.  There does seem to be MORE sound directed BEHIND the television than in front, but it seems to direct it in front fairly well.  A sound bar would likely be a worthy investment for this TV ( or most ANY thin TVs now ), but it's not required ( just makes sure it's not against a shared wall if you're watching TV really loudly :) ).The three places where this TV kind of falls short are: DLNA Video format support, overall interface & the remote.  I think most everyone here has touched on the interface so I won't go too much into it, but it is slow & clunky to deal with.  Sometimes it is so slow it's difficult to know if it responded to your last input.  DLNA video support is very limited.  MP4 playback is non-existent, MKV also fails, and very few AVis actually play.  I updated my twonky server ( runs on a WD MyBook Live ) and it finally started to play some of the AVIs better.  I then updated the firmware on the TV and I had Amazon streaming too which is nice, but the UI is far from ideal.Finally, the remote.  The remote is terribly weak, where it has to be pointed DIRECTLY at the lower left corner of the TV for the commands to register, and if there's even the slightest blockage forget anything working.Overall, I don't reget the purchase, and getting it for $479 + tax is definitely a steal for a \"Smart\" TV of this size.

I just like the thought of knowing that I can watch football and see that the field is green and not some dark algae color like on some tvs. I read some reviews on cnet stating that the color isn't as accurate on panasonic brands and sharps which have a higher price tag. While that is somewhat true, if you read the reviews from others, if you set the color right, then you won't have to worry about the color. Just follow what one reviewer put on here or go to cnet for the color accuracy. The profile for this tv is so thin and the bezel is almost non existent!

And it is a Smart TV. The colors are very accurate and very very good in bright room. The TV works great right outside the box but tweaking is needed for better picture quality. The QWERTY keyboard is heaven sent feature that all remotes should have it. It is so much easier to type things on screen when needed. This remote uses infrared to signal the TV, so you have to keep its sensor towards the TV but i was able to type perfectly fine from 14 feet away regardless of viewing angles, as long as you are pointed in its general direction.The best feature I love about this TV is its ability to play media via DLNA servers. As long as you are on the same network (Wifi or hard wired) you can listen to your music from your computer. This TV is definitely DLNA compatible.To make this feature work for you, i used Windows Media Player as Media Server and I was able to conveniently add music or save movies or videos to my computer's library, and watch & listen them on the Vizio.  All I have to do is Via Button>Media>and up pops the Computer's Library (DLNA 1) to use. I can also put .mkv or .mp4 movies/videos on USB flash drivers and it will play via its USB port but will not playback .avi files.Cons:1) This TV cannot match the black-level performance of Plasma, but definitely comes close to it after tweaking.2) Out-of-box needs tweaking for better picture quality3) You can download the Skype app, but will not work as this TV does not support Skype Camera of anytime.4)  There is a slight lag on the apps to cycle thought but not a deal breaker. But there is no way to configure the keys of the remote to your favorite apps.5) No 3D, but definitely not a deal breaker for me, my previous TV was 3D but IMHO i watched 3 3D movies in 3 years.6) The sound quality is awful from this TV so I definitely recommend using external sound source like surround sound systems.Here are my settings for the TV but you may change according to your liking:Hint: all picture settings can be changed, and there are lot of different settings in built.Picture Mode = CustomBacklight = 70 to 80Brightness = 54Contrast = 65Color = 49Tint = 0Sharpness = 3Color Temp = CustomRed Gain = 104Green Gain = 128Blue Gain = 0Red Offset = 129Green Offset = 128Blue Offset = 134Smooth Motion Effect = LowReal Cinema Mode = OffNoise Reduction = OffMPEG NR = OffColor Enhancement = OffAdaptive Luma = LowBacklight Control = OffAmbient Light Sensor = OffRemember, this is LED and not a plasma. If you want the best quality because you are videophile then go with plasma.Summary:Black Levels: Good but not great like plasmasColor Accuracy: Very accurate minor discolorationVideo Processing: Most of the movies are rendered 1080p/24 for its cadence. The Vizio has two settings that affect cadence/smoothness, named Smooth Motion Effect (SME) and Real Cinema Mode (RCM), and each has three positions. Among the possible combinations, the only one that rendered behavior as described above was Off/Off for both.The other SME settings introduce some level of artificial-looking smoothing/dejudder to film-based sources. As usual the Low/Medium/High options got progressively smoother. Meanwhile Real Cinema Mode (RCM) -- disabled when you turn off SME -- has Precision, Smooth, and Off settings of its own. Off introduced the least smoothing but did show that stuttering cadence; while Precision and Smooth, which introduced excessive smoothing again, looked basically the same to my eyes.Bright Light: It has matte finish, so no reflection, Works really good. But wish there as a glass in the front to protect the LED screen.Overall, this TV serves the purpose I wanted, cheap, superb picture quality with few compromises.

Network capability a boon, too", "Author": "William W. Davis \"famousdavis\"", "ReviewID": "R1TSG6DJJ57ELY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "QUICK SUMMARY:  This is my first Vizio anything.  I was surprised by the lightweight build of this HDTV, but very pleasantly surprised at how beautifully it renders a picture, even right out-of-the-box.  I haven't fiddled with any of the color adjustments because to me, the picture is pretty darn good as-is.  The Internet applications (Netflix, Amazon Prime) work as expected, although I used a wired connection rather than WiFi because the WiFi signal seemed poor.  Recommended!BACKGROUND:  My six-year-old Samsung 37\" TV died, and I wanted a new TV for the upcoming 2014 Olympics.  Frustrated by a Samsung product that was used very lightly over the last six years and that I paid over $1000 for that TV, I opted to try another brand.  I thought about getting an LG, but I read a user review about a horrible LG product failure and subsequent warranty experience, so I moved to try Vizio instead (I understand that every brand has 5-star and 1-star experiences alike, including Vizio).  In my home, I hook-up the TV to my stereo for sound, so I don't care about the sound from the TV itself.  I don't use cable or satellite, but I do watch HD sports programs over-the-air.  My family likes streaming movies from Netflix and Amazon Prime, so the \"smart\" part of the TV was an important feature (good-bye Roku, you served us fairly well....).WHAT I LIKE:- Gorgeous picture, right out of the box.  Blacks are black/very dark, whites are brilliant white, color depth is great, contrast was great.- The viewing angles are all very good for where we have the TV placed; they are notably better than our six-year-old Samsung TV this TV is replacing.- The \"smart\" TV functions work well, are fairly easy to use (searching is a little difficult given the remote control's lack of a QWERTY keyboard).  We've streamed Netflix and Amazon Prime movies without a problem using those built-in apps.- It was very light to pick-up and move around- The slender, 42\" diagonal profile barely fits into my existing entertainment armoire (where six years ago, only a 37\" TV would fit because of the bulkier designs back then)- It has 3 HDMI inputs, which for my needs, is sufficient- It has component input for our Wii- It has an RCA audio output for easy connection to our stereo (an optical audio output, too, for when we upgrade our home sound system)WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- I miss the swivel base of our old Samsung TV; this base doesn't swivel, but it's easy enough to reposition if you need to (tip: place felt underneath the TV stand to make it easier to move- The Wifi signal it received from our router seemed weaker than what our Roku could obtain, so I switched it to a wired connection instead- The remote control doesn't have back-lit keysCONCLUSION:  Visually, I'm very pleased with this TV.  I bought a 4-year Square Trade warranty, though, so I don't have to buy another TV anytime soon.

I would complain about the inefficiency of using the remote to search for videos, but it's trivial enough to use another device (e.g. a smartphone) to control your TV (if you don't know how, the YouTube app on the TV gives instructions and even a useful QR code).Fantastic buy, highly recommended.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy - defective units still exist - Vizio avoids replacing", "Author": "Jon Langevin", "ReviewID": "R1CUCOEOFZOJR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The E701i-A3 model (70\") from Vizio *still* has defects causing the screen to go black during playback.The backlight is completely off when this happens (so complete black), yet the audio continues.

The built in WiFi worked fine for me although since it is only about 10 ft from my router I decided to run an Ethernet cable for a better connection.  I use Hulu and Amazon Instant Video regularly with no issues.  My biggest complaint is the lack of support for playing MP4 files from my DLNA NAS.  The product description say DLNA is supported and didn't mention which file types were supported (at least not that I saw).  It will play AVI files at least.  Another reviewer mentioned it will play MP4 files from a USB attached device which seems odd.  Another issue is that I use the 23\" model in this product line for my computer monitor in the same room.

I sat in line for 6 hours on Black Friday 2012 and was 6th out of 20 to get this TV.  I got it home, out of the box and setup and was wowed by the impressive video quality.  At 52.5lbs, removal from the box is definitely a two person job.  The video quality is comparable to other units that I've paid thousands for.  True blacks, vivid colors and bright whites make watching my movie collection a blast!  With a thin flat glossy bezel that matches the base, the TV is ready for stand or wall-mount.  While on the base, the TV doesn't Pivot, which, in most scenarios isn't much of a loss.The built-in apps are just okay in my opinion, with some stutter or lag in the interface.  The apps are accessed by pressing the Vizio Internet Apps (VIA) button in the middle of the remote.  YouTube searches return a limited number of results with no option to load more.  Netflix and Hulu apps work okay, but I prefer the apps on my XBox 360 or Roku.  Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube videos tend to buffer quite a bit using the built-in SmartApps.  Facebook and news apps also work well.  The Yahoo Widgets and available apps for download could use some diversity.  You also have a limited number of widgets/apps that can be installed at one time.  A built in USB media player works well for displaying photos and HD video loops or screensavers, or even movies (WMA/WMV/and some AVI/MPG).  I currently have this unit setup wired, but I've tried wireless as well.  Performance for me is basically the same on both.The built-in audio quality is quite good for a TV.  Two rear and two side HDMI ports, two USB ports and side located component/composite video inputs plus ethernet port, analog and digital audio inputs and VGA input provide plenty of connection options.  The remote control is a one-piece two sided unit that could use some improvement.  One side is a standard remote, while the flip-side is a QWERTY keyboard for typing text.  It feels solid and well built, however the small rubber buttons are not very sensitive, and aren't backlit.Getting the settings perfect for my environment and preferences took about 20-30 minutes with some HD source reference material.  Once set, the contrast and brightness work well and the colors are rich and vivid.  The 1920X1080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate ensures optimal video and game quality.  Peripheral or off-axis viewing is also better than many comparable units.  This unit doesn't support 3D, but for us it's not really a big loss.When playing Video games, I noticed a perceptible \"lag\" where I would press my joystick and there would be small delay before my on-screen character moved.  I was dismayed and was worried that I'd have to take the TV back.  After some digging I found the solution to the problem.  First:  Switch to the input that the game console is located on.  2.  Press Menu >Picture> Picture Mode and change from 'standard' to 'game'.  3rd.  Press menu, choose the gear icon for 'settings'.  Move down to \"Game Mode\" selection and change from 'off' to 'On'.  Lag problem fixed.  It took me a few hours on forums to find out this undocumented fix.

I called support and after much back and forth they first said not all applications will expand, when I asked for any application that would expand, they went off line then came back and said they did not know of any.  In applications like Netflicks, after a movie is selected for play it does expand, but using anything like face book, or news feeds etc. all stay scrunched on the left.Visio support blamed the issue on Yahoo, saying they just did the hardware, Yahoo did the FW/SW.

Now, a few years back I fawned over 55 inch LCD manufactured under the Vizio Brand. Now Vizio doesn't own several divisions that manufacture the components of their sets. They assemble them and they sell them. That being said, it is not a negative thing. Your automobile is much the same way. It actually gives Vizio an advantage, which it uses to bring good quality HDTV to market, at a very favorable price to the consumer. In the jist of it all, I couldn't really see all that much difference between brands. I have read reviews, and depending on how a HDTV is set up, those \"blacker blacks\" and \"sharper picture\" tend to be negated. You sometimes find yourself looking at sets, using 1080p feeds, tweaked to produce colors not occurring in nature but are found only in knitting yarns. I have so far never been plagued with a pixel problem or other failure, knock on wood. I owe that to Vizio. This set is as good as any I have seen. In this size, it is a bargain and even is $100. lower than I paid (Thank you Amazon for your low price guarantee). I would, well I am recommending this set and without hesitation. I hooked it up to a over the air antenna. It is stunning. Cable signals vary, but little or none of it is 1080p or even 720p. It is compressed to 480i generally. The aspect ratio might get you 1080i on some programs but we are plagued by it. That's why in stores they generally have loop DVD signal in 1080p to impress you. You scratch your head and slowly convenience yourself it's better. Gaming, there are HD games, and here is where it is put to the test. Fantastic. Handled everything threw at it without an artifact. Xbox, PS3, and Nintendo were great. The Razor edge LED appeared to provide solid performance, just a bit brighter and sharper than the Vizio 55 LCD. The viewing angles seemed slightly larger perhaps attributed to the Razor edge LEDs. No ghosting, fades, or bands on any of the Vizios I own. I would have liked to have seen a full LED array for a comparison.That covered, why. It's big. Big is good, bigger is even better. This set, is approximately $110. less than my 55  inch sold for. I moved it to a bedroom, and then the trickle down theory of HDTV's occurs. I would love it if some day the speakers on a TV surpass your wildest expectations. They are okay, not better than the system Bose they are hooked to. That's the only draw back they have, and they are far from being alone in that category.If you want a set that is a good value for it's size, here you go. If you are a videophile, you are considerably better at judging this under varying parameters for which I haven't the slightest clue. But when people come over, and we turn on the HDTV for the game, games or movies. Everyone is quite taken by what they seen and the highest complement one can hear is the surprise after naming the brand and their comments regarding the quality of the picture, and now size. I had people who were amazed at the  55 LCD. They have heard of Vizio. They cannot abandon the brands they have known for so long. These are affordable, well made and  most likely will meet or exceed your expectations. Did I mention it was big?  I love it.

After two weeks of messing around I finally found the key. The default backlight setting is at 80. Another setting allows you to turn off this fixed setting and lowering it finally made the color reproduction to lifelike as well as eliminating pixelization along high contrast edges.

I chose this television. This review is based on my initial assessment of the television, as I've only had it for a day. I will update the review after some long term use.I chose the Vizio due to the fact that, even though the Panasonic was rated higher in terms of picture quality, unfortunately it only had 2 HDMI inputs. The Vizio has 4. Everything in my living room runs on HDMI (XBOX 360, Cable, and Blu-Ray), so that was a deal-breaker for me for the Panasonic. I read a lot of reviews for this Vizio and I bumped into a lot of complaints about the remote control failing and the screen going black after minimal use. Most of these reviews came from people who purchased earlier models. Vizio addressed this issue and let people know that models that had serial numbers \"....WAN100... through ...WAN-800...\" were susceptibe to failing, so when I purchased mine (at BJs Wholesale) I checked to see if the serial number was printed on the box. It was! I chose the television with the highest batch/serial number AWAY from the faulty ones, so I ended up getting a serial number in the range \"...WAP300...\" so I am confident I will not have a problem.Out of the box, I was quite impressed with how thin the set was, but I was also concerned at how small the base was. After installing the base, I found that it's pretty sturdy. It wobbles a bit when jumping around (I have the Kinect for the 360), but nothing that would have me concerned that it would tip over. The frame/bezel of the television is really thin, giving you more television screen (60.04\" measured diagonally), but the downside to that is the speakers for the television are in back of the set. So if you don't have a surround sound system, the television sound will sound pretty cheesy. But I imagine that anyone in the market for a 60\" TV probably has a good system in place.After connecting my cable, Xbox and Blu-Ray, I turned the TV on and it walks you through the setup which is really simple. MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE \"HOME USE\" WHEN IT ASKS YOU. Your other choice is \"Store\". This tweaks all of the settings to give you the recommended store settings, which could be way too bright and sharp for your tastes. Choose home use and tweak your audio/video settings yourself. You can register your TV if you are connected to the internet via wi-fi or hard-wire. It was cool to use the QWERTY keyboard on the back of the remote control. There are a couple of bad things about the remote; The keyboard on the back of the remote doesn't include numbers, so if you have an email address and/or password with a mix of alpha-numeric characters, you'll get a little annoyed having to keep flipping the remote over to type in letters on one side, and numbers on the other. The other downside to the remote, is when you're using the keyboard you have to be careful because it's not bluetooth, and if you hold the remote too perpendicular to your body, it doesn't register your key presses. Not a huge deal, but it can be annoying for those who would do searches on the apps that come with/can be installed on the TV.Once the setup was done, and after some tweaking of the visuals, I must say that I was impressed. The picture quality was noticeably better than my 52\" Sharp AQUOS LCD that it replaced. I wanted to see for myself about this \"Soap Opera Effect\" that is so polarizing with people. I turned on the Smoothing effect and turned it to the highest setting. I thought that it would be more annoying than it was. It did, in fact look like I was watching a soap opera on some shows, but my wife and I thought that it was pretty cool. To each his own. The good news is, you can turn it off if you prefer. We tested our Blu-Ray with a few different movies; Avatar, The Avengers and Finding Nemo. I must admit that, when watching Avatar, due to the smoothness of the motion and some of the shaky camera action, it was a little disorienting, but after a couple of minutes I got used to it. My wife even yelled, \"Well, there. look. Sigourney Weaver is in my living room!\" We tried The Avengers and Finding nemo afterwards and we were not disappointed. Absolutely beautiful. I'm sure that that there are TVs with a better picture quality, but not at this price-point and features.Some of you may have to adjust and/or your picture horizontally or vertically, which can be done in the menus, because the viewing area of the TV is larger than what the channel is projecting, so you may see a staticky digital bar on the edge(s) of your screen. Simple fix though, so don't panick.My only complaint about this TV is that you can notice some uniformity issues during pure black periods of viewing, like in between commercials, a pitch black room in a movie, etc. Certain areas of the screen look like a lighter shade of black than other areas. It doesn't bother me, but if you're used to plasma TVs and their near-perfect black levels, you'll probably find it a bother.Aside from a few little things, this TV is absolutely perfect for the price.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this T.V.", "Author": "Grandma", "ReviewID": "R1TXNEAIM1AHQC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took us a long time to decide on a big screen TV but finally after much research we purchased the 60\u201d VIZIO.

For instance, Amazon video has no way to save the shows I watch. I have to use the search function every time I want to go to a series I watch. Also, would it kill Vizio to allow us to label channels? My cable does not come with a cable box, and the channels are not labelled. It should take very little effort to put in a function so I can name channels. Throw us a software update Vizio. When you use the smart TV it creates a new temporary input. So if I am watching Hulu, for instance, and I switch to my xbox, that temporary internet input goes away. So you have to go through the entire system to restart an internet video. Also, the HDMI inputs on the back are recessed with a ledge opposite the opening that makes them very difficult to plug in to. And the remote has to be pointed lake a laser at the receiver on the bottom left corner of the TV. Seriously, if you just point it at the center of the TV it won't work. A minor annoyance but I don't understand how this got past testing.

It fits with room to spare in my 30 inch wide wall units in my small (12 by 20) living room. It is so much smaller than the former Sansui 32 inch CRT it replaced that I bought a one drawer glossy black modular storage drawer unit and put it under the TV to store DVDs, remotes, manuals, etc. The narrow edge design is probably the reason why it is not as wide as other competitor's sets or even other Vizio models with a 31.5 inch screen size. Setup took all of 25 minutes, including doing two scans for digital off-air channels (I assume scanning for cable channels without a box would be similar). I was able to connect my digital HD cable TV converter box (required by my Bright House service for its HD channels and premium channels) using one of the TV's two HDMI ports, then connected my DVD player via the composite RCA female jacks and my amplified off-air antenna to the female coaxial cable/TV port (hence a 32 channel \"backup\" in case the cable goes out). There is also a USB port that allows inserting a flash drive so that you can view photos on the TV. I will be buying a second HDMI cable so that I can connect my HP Pavilion multimedia notebook with a HDMI port to view movies, etc. In addition, this is a Smart HDTV and has several Internet apps already configured, and more can be downloaded. The TV established a connection with my encrypted wireless g/n home network with a \"hidden\" ID without a hitch -- just type in the network name and the WEP key, wait a few seconds, and you are connected for Hulu, Netflix, etc. (no Roku box required). If you want one of these, I suggest you act fast ...

It was delivered on time, for free, and the drivers were helpful and professional. They informed me I would be unable to test my new TV until it came up to room temperature (3-5 hours)as it was winter in Chicago and the cold truck was below the ideal operating temperature. After a brief Google search I discovered that, sadly, they were right and I would have to wait to use it. Even powered off the TV looks great. Slim, sleek and shiny.When it finally came time, I turned on the screen and after a few minor adjustments, I was amazed by the picture quality. (A personal suggestion, turn off the \"smooth motion setting\" it creates a bizarre soap opera effect on everything.) Set-up was a breeze. Wi-Fi, digital cable, PlayStation and receiver were working together in no time. The included apps (Netflix, Amazon, etc.) run a little less smoothly than they do on my PS3 but they're not terrible and the included QWERTY keypad on the back of the remote makes the interface more enjoyable. There are 4 HDMI ports (more than most other 60') and you can name each of them on the TV so switching between inputs is super easy. The menu is not as intuitive as I would like but after you get used to it, navigating the settings is simple enough.There was one MAJOR problem, however. Once a day, at random intervals, the TV would just power down. It would always turn back on from the remote but, obviously, it was a nuisance. It happened across every type of use. Cable, PlayStation, native applications, everything. I tried a factory reset, changed outlets, surge protectors, and any settings having to do with power. No dice. I searched the internet and discovered that, although this was not a common problem, it was not unheard of. Many people had theories as to why this was happening, and suggestions on how to fix it, none of which worked.Realizing I was going to be unable to solve this problem myself, I emailed Vizio directly with a description of the problem. The next day they told me to contact Customer Service by phone. That annoyed me because I hate talking on the phone but, whatever. I called and spoke to an unbelievably friendly and helpful woman named Sandy who was in South Dakota. It was refreshing to speak with someone who not only spoke English but was pleasant and knowledgeable as well. I honestly cannot remember the last time I enjoyed dealing with a Customer Service Representative. She apologized, told me that Vizio was aware of the problem and that they would FedEx a new board to a local repair shop who would contact me to set up an in home appointment and take care of the problem.To my surprise, I was contacted that night by the repairman and informed that the service request was made and the part should arrive in 2 days. As promised he called back when he had the part and scheduled a time the very next day to stop by. The repair man arrived within the scheduled window, was polite and professional and in 15 minutes he was done.Since then, 2 weeks ago, I have had zero issues with my TV. I could not be more impressed with the way Vizio and the people they used, handled the situation. Although, obviously, I wish I had never encountered the problem in the first place, Vizio really showed me that they are a reliable company who stands behind their product and I will certainly buy from them again, when the time comes.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "good performance for price", "Author": "Robin M \"robin_M\"", "ReviewID": "RNDA79VEYXHI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I want to reiterate some findings other have mentioned.I have had this TV for about three months having bought it from Costco for their Black Friday deal. Satisfied with the purchase. It is a large TV - for the price I paid of fifteen hundred plus tax and ninety nine for Costco extended warranty I cannot really complain about a few shortcomings:The black/grey level across the screen is not uniform, likely from the edge lit technology, it's not distracting 99% of the time. If you watch sci-fi where there are a lot of space panning scenes you might notice it more. My TV is in the family room and not for critical movie watching. My wife, kids and friends have not commented on it at all.I also was excited to have the Skype app (which was on the product specs at the time of purchase) but found out to date that Vizio is still working with Skype to get their camera certified. I look forward to this in the upcoming few months.Off angle viewing does reduce contrast very quickly, I have Plasma TV in the adjacent room which has fantastic off angle viewing so this was noticeable to me on the Vizio.TV is quite heavy. Please make sure you get a good wall mount and you will need two people to unbox and hang this TV.Minor lip sync issues initially but I think that a firmware fixed this.  I used a receiver to route HDMI signal and that had some corrective delay that fixed this for me.Other than the above I am very happy with this TV, the PQ is great, colors are really nice. The TV has a thin bezel. There are quite a few apps.

The Vizio Smart HDTV E60 60 inch LED TV delivers a crisp display with vibrant colors and deep blacks. The 120Hz effective refresh rate and \"smooth motion\" projects a lifelike picture. Media from Netflix, Xfinity and played via the TV's USB port all looked stunning.The Vizio Smart HDTV E60 has Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and Crackle build in among other apps. If you are looking to deliver content to the Vizio Smart HDTV E60 via other methods it is more than easy.The Vizio Smart HDTV E60 is loaded with input options, four HDMI inputs, a component input for you old school folks, a VGA input for your PC and 2 USB ports. The USB ports automatically recognize music, photo, and movie media.  As I said earlier, playing a movie from a thumb drive looked spectacular. Even Netflix delivered from my Motorola Droid via mini HDMI cable looked decent. There is also an ethernet input allowing you to connect to your home network, a lightning fast wireless connection is also an option.The sound on the Vizio Smart HDTV E60 is not mind-blowing. While it is good enough for sports and TV shows, I found it lacking for concert video and music. There is a companion sound bar available for just under $200, though it really is not necessary. I would imagine anyone buying a 60-inch TV would be pairing it with a home theater system. The Vizio Smart HDTV E60 connects to your theater system via digital audio out (SPDIF) or analog RCA.The Vizio Smart HDTV E60 is becoming the number one purchased television in America.

I purchased it yesterday from Best Buy for $899 and I have been more than pleased with my purchase. The television looks even better at home than it does in the store. While at Best Buy I spent a lot of time going back and forth between the Vizio, Samsung, and the Sharp and the Vizio seemed to offer the best reviews as well as the cheapest price. While the Samsung smart tv might be appealing to the eye, it had the poorest reviews which is surprising for a television that costs $3k and up.I bought my first Vizio 32\" about 6 years ago and still have it in one of my guest bedrooms. It still work the same as the day I opened it, so I decided to consider the same brand when looking for a 60\". Overall I would have to say that I am more than satisfied with this tv.As far as screen quality and adjustments, I utilized the review provided on here by Kris and the picture quality is amazing. I however like that \"soap opera\" look so I do leave that feature on. Easy to turn off though.Also, make sure that your cable box is set to 1080p or 1080i. I forgot to check this until the next day and now the picture is even better!!The only con that I have found with this tv as of now is that the MGo feature does not work. Not sure really what it even is for, but a little obnoxious that there is a permanent button on the remote that will not do anything for who knows how long.And one more thing, I am pretty disappointed that the remote cannot be paired with any of my other devices such as my home theater system or even my cable box. So unfortunately, unless you want to lose the Qwerty remote, you gave to get used to using two or more different remotes. Of course it could be worse, but in my opinion a simple fix that they could have made in order for the customer to be completely satisfied with their purchase.Overall I would definitely recommend this television to anyone!", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV vastly exceeded expectations", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R24JK98D2YKRG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We spent a long time deciding on a TV.

I called Vizio tech support and was told that this is a known issue for which they are releasing a firmware update.\"Great, how can I get this update?\" I ask.\"We're pushing it out in batches of 1,000 at a time so as not to crash the server.  But we sold over 100,000 units on Black Friday alone, so I can't tell you how long it will be before you get it.\"\"Oh, ok,\" I said.  \"Can I just download the update via your website and install it myself?\"\"No, sorry; it's not available that way.\"So, basically, Vizio knows there is an issue (a pretty major one, too), but they won't even make the firmware update available for manual install.

Everything worked fine out of the box, easy setup.  I should note that I'm not a major cinephile or audiophile, just an average user who watches about 2 hours a day between me and the wife...but for us the picture is great.I used some picture settings from CNET that I found online and they seem to make a really good picture.  If you were inclined to use a video tuning DVD you could probably get it down to near perfect, but honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference anyway and it isn't worth my time.  When it turns on, it shows a black screen with the Vizio logo...from that screen you see that the blacks aren't 100% uniform, but I still think the picture is fine and my wife gave me a crazy look when I pointed it out.We use it for cable television, netflix, and dvds mostly. We just moved into a new house and wanted a bigger television for the living room. The Netflix app works great for us over a standard wifi connection with WPA2.  The youtube app works fine as well.  We don't really use the other apps that came with it so I can't really comment.  The remote with QWERTY keyboard works very well and is useful for searching movies and clips on youtube.We use an LG speakerbar with a wireless sub, so I can't really comment on the speakers at-length, but they seemed fine for a normal size living room when compared to other built-in speakers I've used.  If you're an average user who wants a good quality 60 inch TV at a reasonable price with built in netflix, amazon prime, and youtube you won't be disappointed.  If you're the over-the-top home theater keeping-up-with-the-Jones' type who wants a picture that is top of the line and has 3000 pixels per molecule, then this obviously isn't for you.

Netfix, Amazon Prime and You Tube seem to work quite well, but for some reason Hulu playback will stutter at times, not sure whats up with that, the Roku box and PS3 which are right next to the TV on the same wifi network never stutter on Hulu. The other issue I ran into was lip sync issue .. audio would get out of sync after about 2 hrs or so .. if you changed the channel and came back it was ok again for 1-2 hrs.. I was getting ready to send it back then decided to take the TWC DVR box off of it and use one of my other TWC HD boxes on it.. strangely the lip sync issue seems to have stopped.Currently I purchased a TIVo Premiere box and have not seen the lip sync issue so I have decided to keep it, but I see I have till Jan 31 st 2013 to return it, just in case.One more thing if you are watching the tv pretty much straight on the picture like I said is very good, but as you start viewing it from an angle the picture starts looking washed out, it does not have even remotely as good side view as the Plasma it replaced.. so something to keep in mind.I was not one of the lucky ones to get it at the Black Friday price, but it was 949.00 for  like two hours and did get it at that price, which compared to other smart 60 inch TV's is a pretty good price.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "Marion Strong", "ReviewID": "R96S1MRP47XYP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "recieved on 12-05-2012................hooked up 12-07-2012....................Quit working 12-27-2012.

Walmart had for the same price but added sales tax and took two weeks.  Bought via Amazon Prime, so paid $0 shipping and received it 3 biz days after ordering.  We picked it up at the docks, since they can only give you a \"range\" for delivery, and that will vary depending on local truck line delivering, which isn't Amazon's fault.  I own two 42\" Vizio TVs so trusted the brand enough to order sight unseen.  I use it 60% as a computer monitor in the LR, the rest for watching cable TV.The picture quality if flat out amazing.  Blacks are blacker than regular LCD, the color depth and saturation was perfect out of the box.  Works great with Amazon Prime free videos and Netflicks with easy setup.  DVDs look real like you are a part of the picture, with lifelike color and brightness.  The only think I noticed is that you see more artifacts with YouTube videos simple because the screen is so large, so flaws in the video are more obvious.Remote is quite good, with a keyboard on the back that doesn't get in the way.  Much more intuitive than previous remotes.  Setup and menu functions are WAY more intuitive.  Renaming the HDMI inputs as \"Cable TV\" and \"PC\" were simple and fast.  The whole menu system is an overlay to the TV, significantly faster and easier than just a couple years ago.  From the time I plugged it in to the time I was watching TV and using the computer was literally just a couple of minutes.  Using HDMI for both the cable box and the PC.  Speakers in the TV are much better than the 42\" Vizio TVs I currently have, much broader output, less tinny.  Not great, but good and anyone that is an audiophile will have a full audio system anyway.  All and all, an exceptional value for the money.Follow up:Had for a while now, still love it as much as I did the first day.  The image quality is simply amazing.

We've tried plugging and unplugging it multiple times, different wall sockets, the remote and the physical buttons, and it just wouldn't work.

Very happy with that.Cons:- Lipsync issues. Ugh, I've never had this problem with a TV before and it was remarkably annoying. I'm very sensitive to this and it bothered me a lot.- No options for other apps to download- Weak DLNA function crashed frequently when grabbing items from my NAS.

This TV is located in my bedroom, which is at the opposite end of the house from my wireless router. Please note, I am still using a WRT54g. Despite the distance, the TV still has decent signal strength and can stream in HD without a hiccup. The TV start up takes a little longer than expected, and the apps are not incredibly fast either, but these are such minor complaints that are made up for in the fantastic picture quality at a bargain price.For those of you that have seen the E601 in person, this TV's picture looks entirely different.  Despite it being 120hz, the E500 does not have the same \"soap opera effect\" (SOE) as the E601.

So first off I would definitely recommend this TV one for the price, second for the technology within the TV, and third for the fact I don't have to fight people in the stores for it.  But I will tell there a few things to be aware of.  This is only a \"720p\" and not the standard \"1080p\" definition most TV's are today.  The second thing I noticed while reviewing this TV it that it only has to 2 HDMI outputs.  This could be an issue for you if you will have alot of things plugging into it.  But with all that said I have had some great looking 720p TV's and this TV is under $300 dollars.  So I still would recommend it.2 years ago you could not even dream about getting a 32 inch LED Smart TV for under $300 dollars, times have definitely changed.  This review will act as a guide as well as a review for this VIZIO.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to youNow first thing when a TV says its LED that is very similar to LCD.  The main difference with this type of TV is the way the lighting within the TV is done.  LED is back-lit better so that their are no dark spots on the screen.  The term SMART TV means this TV has the ability to directly connect to the internet.  But what makes a TV a smart TV is its ability to connect all of your devices together.  The Smart TV is the train conductor that can push content from your DVD's, game systems, and other devices to the TV.The next step is to look at the features that are offered with the TV. Here are some offered by this VIZIO Smart TV:SMART TV Internet Apps this TV has built-in Wi-Fi which allows you to watch internet content like Netflix, rent movies through the TV.  Pretty much whatever you can do on your computer you can do on this TV.- With LED backlighting the pops with rich color and vivid details.- This LED HDTV is up to 50% more energy efficient than conventional LCD HDTVs to save money.- The slim frame design for this VIZIO lets you maximize your space, allowing you to fit a bigger screen size TV in the same space.- Here is the input/Output layout: 2 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 Composite (shared with component), RF Connector for Internal Tuner, 1 Ethernet, and 1 USB 2.0.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "BROKE", "Author": "John E.

It was delivered on Monday at 12:00 in the afternoon. The delivery service was fast, cordial and professional. They came in with the tv, removed it from the box, turned it on and hooked it up so I could inspect it. It was very bright in the room being lunch time and everything appeared to look good. It came on, the picture was beautiful, colorful and clear. The speakers give a very crisp and clear sound and is very loud on just a 1/3 of the volume. The internet interface is extremely easy to use and it was very easy to connect to our wifi. The connection was strong and worked just fine. I tried out Netflix and it streamed just fine through the tv and the sound quality again was very good. (Mind you this is all a review from our \"tester\" room before mounting it in our great room). I didn't mess too much with the picture settings and I won't until we get it mounted. I enjoyed the television throughout the day but when the sun started to set I noticed a BIG issue.My reason for the 2 star review- The lower left of the television is not backlit. You can clearly see how the light goes throughout the back and around the entire frame of the television until it gets to about the last 1/6th of the lower left corner and then the light just drops off. Clearly a damaged display light. It casts a horrible shadow over the lower left of the screen.I called Amazon first to find that the tv was not in stock and I would have to wait for a replacement an unsure amount of time. I then called Vizio to check on \"going through warranty.\" and to see if this is a common occurrence. They said that it is not common and they've actually not heard a complaint like this before and they had me send a photo. Sure enough they saw it too. It would take nearly 6 weeks to go through warranty. Of course we chose otherwise.I have decided to do an exchange with Amazon since this tv is back in stock. They are sending me out one as quickly as possible and I should have my replacement within the next 7 days (in spite of it being Christmas). I am hoping that this was just a fluke and the second one coming will be trouble free.I will update my rating when I receive this second one.****December 27th, 2012--- reduced my 2 star rating to a 1 star rating after receiving defective TV #2.UPDATE: I just refused shipment on the second one.

If the third one fails we will likely be going to Best Buy to purchase a different brand all together. I'm surprised at the failure of this tv and brand after all the rave reviews here as well as from friends. Hoping that the 3rd time is the charm.I will update when I receive the third one...************UPDATE: January 11th, 2013We finally received our tv for the 3rd time on January the 3rd.

We got rid of a 57\" projection HDTV and a huge entertainment console that went around it.  Let me say first, if that is your current arrangement - do what I did.  Our room is so much larger now.  I told my wife before it came that she would say she thought it would be bigger (that'd be a first), and that is exactly what she said once we had it on the new entertainment center.  Go big or go home.The picture is excellent.  I am not one of those uber-picky AVS forum members (although I am a member) that talks about weird terms you've never heard of and has you looking for flashlighting or shadows etc.  The picture is simply excellent.  Realize, if you are watching cable or satellite, they compress the signals you receive, so the \"HD\" picture you receive is not as good as a Bluray.  But, it is still excellent.  Be sure to turn off the 120 Mhz motion setting  - it makes everything look like a soap opera with very harsh video looking effects, but that is true for all new tvs.The screen has no glare.  This is a major improvement over the plasmas on the market and even my old set.The sound is not great.  I'd give it three stars.  It can get plenty loud, but when there are voices and music playing during dramatic scenes, the music makes the voices very hard to hear.  I will be using external speakers with my set, so this will not be a problem.The built-in applications are much better than I expected.

I shopped around for the best quality/price compromise, asking advice from friends as to which brands have good reputations. Not having an unlimited budget, I soon found my choices narrowed down to this Visio model and another one with 3-D capability. Since I have no use for 3-D, I went with this model, which also saved me a few bucks over the 3-D. I managed to assemble the base by myself, but as other reviews have noted it is easier to do with an extra set of helping hands. After hooking it up and setting up the WiFi, I turned it on expecting to be wowed by the picture compared to my old Sony. After all, the technology has improved quite a bit in the last 7 years, but I was sorely disappointed! The picture was dull, flat and not all that sharp. I wondered if I had made a $648 mistake! But it was getting late and my wife and I had to leave for church. When we got back a couple hours later and turned on the set, we were greeted by an on-screen message telling us a firmware update had been installed. The picture now looked entirely different; bright, vivid and beautifully sharp. The viewing angle is amazing; any seat in the house is comfortable viewing. The remote works at almost any angle and is pretty straightforward and user friendly, although I'm stumped as to why there are 2 buttons (INFO and GUIDE) that perform the exact same function? Well, I guess it's always good to have a backup. I haven't used the \"smart\" features yet (with the exception of the automatic firmware update), so I cannot comment on how well streaming movies works. Bottom line: I love this set!

The initial picture was not as sharp as our other Vizio and it seemed kind of dim. I tried numerous picture setting changes without much luck. I went online and found a post from someone who had purchased the calibration discs for this model, he then reposted the various setting for brightness, contrast, color, etc. I tried entering those settings, which helped a little, but the picture still wasn't near as good as our 42\" Vizio.Next I called Vizio Tech Support. They were helpful, and walked me through several setting adjustments. It's still a little better, but not as good as our other set. I would have thought that this smaller set (39\" vs 42\") would have a crisper picture since they were both 1080p and 120 Hz refresh rate, but it isn't. It's acceptable, just not great.The remote isn't great either. It would be nice if the keys had backlighting, especially since this TV is for our bedroom and the lights are typically off when we are watching. The buttons are also quite close together, which makes it hard to hit the right button, especially if its dark.I do like the wi-fi feature and internet apps. I like the dedicated buttons on the remote for Netflix and Amazon Video (because I subscribe to them both), but there is also a dedicated button for \"M-Go\". I wasn't familiar with M-Go, but did some checking. It's a pay-as-you-go video rental service. Their selection is not very good and their rental pricing was not very attractive. Unless something changes with M-Go, I don't think it will be around very long. Maybe that button can be reprogrammed in the future if M-Go goes belly up.The initial set-up for was pretty easy and I didn't need to try to run an ethernet cable to the device because of the built in wi-fi, which made set up simple.Maybe I just got a bit of a lemon.

Until this problem occurred, the TV reception was outstanding, pulling in about 20 local channels, of which seven were in crystal clear high definition.  The TV also produced very good video from an up converting DVD player connected through the HDMI input.  Setting up the wireless function was quick and easy and I enjoyed listening to music through Pandora.Putting aside the catastrophic failure of the OTA TV reception, my only complaint with this TV lies with the small built-in speakers - the audio sounds tinny and anemic.  This, however, is not a major issue for me since I have a small home theater system connected to the TV through the TV's headphone jack.  The TV also has a digital optical output jack, but my inexpensive home theater receiver lacks a digital audio input, so I get stereo audio from the TV through the left and right front speakers in the home theater systemWhen I encountered the problem with no TV reception, I immediately called Amazon's technical support.  The tech rep suggested several possible fixes, most of which I had already tried and when it became obvious that there was a major problem that could not be resolved over the telephone, the tech rep arranged for a free exchange for a new TV.  Fortunately, I was still within Amazon's 30 day return period on my original purchase.  I just received the new TV today and it is working properly.  I will supplement this report as I get further use with the replacement.This 24 inch Smart HD TV offers a lot of bang for the buck and I am hoping the replacement unit, unlike the original, gives me many years of use.  If you purchase this TV, or for that matter any other electronic product, from Amazon, my suggestion is that you give it a heavy workout during the first 30 days.

Unfortunately many TVs now lack an audio out that follows the change of video input. Vizio is one of the few companies that still offers this feature in moderately priced TVs. I had purchased a Vizio 32\" TV in the past year for a relative and was pleased with the image so I wasn't worried about picture quality much although I knew that it would probably be a step down from Samsung's high quality.First of all, after fidgeting with the cable box to get the audio thru the HDMI, the analog audio out works well and the sound is good thru my speakers. But my warning to you starts here. Vizio has programmed the set to do a lot of \"intelligent\" automatic adjustments out of the box. The most noticeable is how the image is constantly adjusting itself every time a scene changes or the camera pans to a different image in the same scene. This is probably fine during a baseball game but during an average TV show or movie it's changing all the time. This irritated me to no end so I spent a few minutes and turned off every automatic function in the picture menu. From there I manually adjusted the image to my liking and it's been great ever since. The same goes with the audio, there a few automatic functions that I turned off and now it's sounding great thru the external speakers. The internal speakers are OK, better than on the Samsung but not much.Now that the set is up and been getting daily use for two weeks, I am very happy with it. The only issue I have is the loud pop it sends out on the external analog audio as the set warms up. This may not happen with the optical audio out but I can't test this. I have not tested the Smart TV part yet as my BluRay is already set up for this although it is so slow I might be tempted to see if the Vizio is faster.Update: I finally decided to switch the internet connection over to the Vizio as I was getting frustrated with how slow my 3 year old Samsung BluRay player would take to update and to switch from selection to selection for internet content. The first thing you have to do is accept some sort of Yahoo service with checkboxes, you are not asked for any info. As I wanted to watch something only available on NetFlix online I set up the account which was reasonably easy. There are other on-line options on the Vizio which I haven't tried. Netflix booted up quickly and the quality of the image is much better than the Samsung BluRay player. However, I quickly noticed that all my manual settings for the image and audio had reverted to the factory defaults. The picture went back to adjusting itself in the middle of scenes. So I went thru the menus and set everything to manual again. Not sure why this happened but the very first time i turned on the set, the Yahoo acceptance selection came up automatically. I ignored it so possibly it's somehow hooked into the initial set-up of the set and it reset everything when I finally accepted it. Keep this in mind if you purchase the set. The Vizio already did a software update since I hooked it up and it did it totally in the background unlike the Samsung BluRay player which prevents you from doing anything until it is finished.This is a very good television.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio makes a great TV", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R559AD966MDUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this 60 inch TV by Vizio.

The design included a space for a wide-screen TV.  The designer misinformed me about the size of the space so I purchased a 26\" TV.  It was a nice TV but I wanted the biggest TV that could fit into the 29.5\"-wide space.  I hoped to fit a 32\" TV in the space, but the smallest 32 had a 29.5 width.  I thought about ordering it, but opted to not risk it. I, therefore, purchased the 29\" VIZIO instead.The bezel is very slim, so the TV easily fits in the allotted space. The price is definitely a bargain.  My BIL purchased a 30\" HD about 7-8 years ago. The image quality was not nearly as good, and the cost was at least 3 times as much.  The IQ on the VIZIO is good in standard def, and excellent in HD.  That really isn't much of a surprise since it is much easier to produce a 29-30\" screen than a 52\" screen like I have in my bedroom.  Moreover, the capabilities are excellent.  I'm an Amazon Prime Instant Video user.  To see IV movies on my other TVs, I use a Blu-Ray player that has WI-FI and extra functions built in. It's always a hassle switching from regular TV to the extra functions.  By contrast, on the VIZIO, there is a dedicated Amazon IV button built into the remote! In fact there are two other dedicated buttons for NetFlix and U-GO. In addition, it appears that there are 4 additional buttons that can be programmed, presumably to access other services. I have to give the TV a top score for added functionality.However, I have to deduct a star for the construction.  VIZIO must intend this TV to be wall mounted because the stand is the crappiest piece of design I have seen associated with a high quality electronic product.  The stand is basically a flimsy piece of plastic that screws into the back.  Like a desktop picture frame, it points the TV upwards at about a 25 degree angle.  For me, this is unacceptable since the TV is already sitting on a shelf that's almost 6' above the floor. I had to put something under the stand to shift the angle.  This fix doesn't leave me with the greatest confidence that I won't lose the TV due to an accident bump or earthquake.Therefore, if you plan to wall mount this product, it deserves 5 stars. If, however, you need to employ the cheap stand, then the TV leaves a little bit to desire.Regardless, given the incredibly low price, it's hard for me to complain to loudly.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fashlighting and white dots on the bottom screen", "Author": "Joe M.", "ReviewID": "R311Y1BGAHI4MZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Two problems I found is that there is a small brite spot on the bottom right hand corner.

My Samsung was a 720p DLP. This is a 1080p LED. My wife immediately noticed the difference when I was playing 1080p content. She mentioned several times to me how beautiful the picture is. I sensed she was skeptical when I bought it because I don't think she has ever heard of Vizio before. I had though, so it wasn't a concern for me.- The sound is pretty good. I noticed when I watched Jurassic Park on this tv though that it lacks bass (during the title sequence with the loud booms). When I had my Samsung, I had the video and audio running through an Onkyo receiver. The sound coming through the 7.1 speakers clearly blew away anything out of the tiny speakers in this tv (which I presume are larger than some thinner tvs).- Because this tv had 4 HDMIs (4!), I could hook up all of my devices without needing an a/v receiver. I sure do miss the bass though, but I'm in a town-home. My neighbors probably have no complaints now.- Built-it Netflix and Amazon (to name just two) saves me from having to run my 2nd generation \"fat\" PS3 (another 300 watts).- In about a month of using this tv, I have saved 200 kilowatt hours and some money too on my electricity.Cons:-The remote is terrible. It is nice to have built-in buttons for Netflix and Amazon, but this remote requires you to press hard to get a response. Sometimes, you don't even know if the press registered. I replaced it with a programmable Logitech Harmony. This tv also requires you to point your remote directly at the sensor on the lower left corner of the bezel, or nothing happens.-The Internet apps, including Netflix are slow to load and buggy.I ordered it here at Amazon, price is just amazing: http://amzn.to/13ErHQn", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "it stopped working after only 4 months of very limited use !", "Author": "Pamela J.

Now that I have a new theater room with windows, I wanted a LCD/LED TV to compete.The TV arrived in a giant box, and surprise had a giant TV. Though it still seemed small to me, my girl friend was very excited about it's size. The picture is great, provided scenes are not too dark. All black reveals why this TV is cheaper, bleeding and contrast uniformity is not there- but I don't mind that and really only notice it on the black INPUT SELECT screen.The remote is pretty neat, however not many applications allow you to use the keyboard in my experience. I wish there was a way to assign inputs to buttons, instead of pressing input and scrolling each time.Annoyances:The TV OSD (interface / GUI) is terrible. It runs very slow, which is surprising because apps run very well. It reminds me of older android phones, where input is very laggy and outdated feeling. It works, however it does not feel like it belongs on such an expensive TV.-Streaming, I thought I was going to be able to play .mkv files on this TV, and while you can - it's difficult to stream them.

I contacted Amazon asking about their price-matching because I saw a lower price at a \u201cdiscount club\u201d.  Initially the rep said I did not qualify since they (Amazon) had to add the \u201cclub membership of $40.00\u201d to the club price.  That would have brought it back very close to Amazon\u2019s price.  We hung up the call and within 2 minutes the rep called me back.  He realized that Amazon had made the price change I mentioned above and said I DID qualify.  He issued a credit to my account which was reflected within 24 hours.  I also got Amazon\u2019s 2% bonus credited to me \u201cfor use on a future purchase\u201d.  Shipping & Delivery \u2013As an Amazon Prime subscriber I was offered delivery on 11/28.  Since Amazon also offered \u201cwhite glove\u201d delivery, with a scheduled date & time, I opted for it.  My TV was delivered on 12/1.  Although the delivery was about 1 hour late, I was still satisfied with it.  Sound \u2013I was OK with the sound from the TV speakers but I certainly recognize that there are MANY better options.  Having them rear-facing dampens whatever comes out of them.  As a result, I added a sound bar to my setup.  I am using the Vizio SB4021M-A1.  It requires one optical connection and a power connection.  Now everything sounds GREAT.  Wall Mount \u2013I opted for a wall mount from Monoprice(dot)com (less than $30.00).  It is a flush mount which can tilt some 15*.  With the TV mounted the front bezel is 4 inches from the wall.  The mount is \u201cPID 4174\u201d and is described as  \u201cPREMIUM Adjustable Tilting 2.5mm Wall Mount Bracket for LCD LED Plasma (Max 165Lbs, 30~63inch) BLACK\u201d on the web site.  This is one sturdy mount.  With a little help from the Mrs. it was installed & TV hanging in about 45 minutes.  Picture --I, like most users of this TV have played with the picture settings to obtain those which are ideal to me.  I have mine set pretty well, but I am still experimenting with them.  The quality of the picture and the colors etc. are just GREAT.  I\u2019ve heard many people complain about theirs, but mine are all anyone could ask for.  Accessories --I have a Vizio sound bar model SB4021M-A1 attached.  I also have a Samsung Blu-Ray Disc/DVD Player model BD-EM57C attached to my TV.  I opted to use HDMI ports 3 and 4 for my connections.  (Some people had difficulty using HDMI 1 due to its ARC feature and they thought it was possibly their lip sync problem too).  Issues \u2013Many people have complained about getting the BSOD (black screen of death) which led to repairs and or replacement of the TV.  I have not had such an encounter.I have had a minimal amount of lip sync, but the more I watch and pay attention, it appears to be a particular program on a particular network rather than a TV issue.  As a result, I have no complaint.The VIA bar (access to the SMART features) leaves a bit desired.  However, I didn't buy this TV to use it as a computer.  I've had no issues with any of the apps within the VIA bar, e.g. NETFLIX and others.  Conclusion \u2013I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 60\u201d flat screen.  This TV replaced a Samsung 56\u201d DLP set that was about 7 years old.  The picture quality is hands down better on the Vizio than it was on the Samsung.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best 60\" for the price!", "Author": "R. B.

That gets old quick!It was time for the LED/LCD technology.I took a hard look at the Sharp 70's and the Samsung's--$2200----$2,800 just seemed too high.So I waited.When Amazon finally dropped the price to $1599, I jumped.WOW! What a difference. The 1,000,000 to one ratio makes a huge difference as does the LED back lighting.The colors just jump off the screen.

There was no difference in price and I wanted to see the floor model before I bought. But I like the Amazon user reviews, this is my 'go-to' site for user reviews so I want to contribute my experience with this TV.The 60 inch screen is BIG! Not TOO big, mind you, but big enough, and we have a large family room, I think. I'm glad I let my wife talk me out of that 70 inch screen.  It would have overpowered that room. I suspect you won't see many TVs much larger than 70 inches in size in the future, I can't imagine a room in a typical family home that could handle such a screen.  Remember, they look a lot smaller in the showroom! It replaced an old 48 inch 1st gen Panasonic rear projection HD TV that was showing its age (but was plenty big screen wise)Image quality and color is REALLY good, and I have not noticed the narrow angle of view issue that many reviews refer to and I think we have a wide viewing angle in our family room. Image quality is good EVEN when using 75 ohmn coax, IQ with the composite cables are at least as good as with coax.  We have digital, but not HD cable service, so I guess we get our signal in at 480p from cable, but the image is excellent, better than the old Panny.From other user reviews, I had done my research and was prepared to make the needed adjustments that would take care of any lip synch issues I might encounter.  However, I didn't have any lip synch problems.  I wonder if that issue is related to a certain brand or type of cable box.Netflix and Amazon have dedicated buttons on the remote so using them is EASY.  Netflix comes in at 720p as always, and the image is amazing on this TV. I don't use Amazon prime.Regarding the remote, it's pretty cool.  On one side, it is a standard remote with dedicated Netlix and Amazon buttons on the front, and on the flip side,it has a full QUERTY Chicklet type keyboard. On the keyboard side, there are also some gaming type control buttons.  You can download games from the app store (run by Yahoo on behalf of Vizio).  Other apps include Crackle, Hulu+, Vudu, etc. Pretty much similar in variety and in operation to the Roku store. More on this in a bit.The sound is typical tiny and tinny tv sound.  But in defense, the bezel (the frame) around the screen is only about 1/2 inch wide and an inch or so deep, not a lot of space for room filling speakers.  I think we will buy a sound bar for this set eventually.  But I have some spare higher quality PC speakers, in the meantime, I will look into hooking them up.Edit 1/15/13:I've tried to hook up my computer speakers to this TV only to discover that there is no 3.5 mm mini-plug outlet.  There are 2 RCA audio connections on the back and theoretically you can get a converter that converts to a female mini-plug, but Best Buy and HH Greg don't seem to carry them.  I guess I could order from Amazon or other internet vendor, but it seems kind of crazy to pay all that shipping if you don't have other things to buy.  I'll try Radio Shack across town later today.Major problem? No, but a bit of a pain, yes.  The 3.5 mini-plug socket should be part of any device with audio, in my mind.End of Edit:Set up was kind of odd. My Comcast cable box is considered an antenna source if using 75 ohm coax, but a cable connection if using composite cables on the same cable box. (My Comcast Cable box doesn't have HDMI).  The directions could have been clearer on this.I think the User Interface for set up is kind of complex and not very intuitive. I think it could be easier to use. As I said earlier, you have the ability to download apps to the TV from Yahoo even a few games and special Yahoo content apps, however that process seems kind of hidden.  Once you get to it, it works great and it's easy, but getting there is a tad difficult.  That being said, it is unlikely a child would accidentally get there and download something you don't want on your set.The wireless internet connectivity works pretty well.  My wireless router is about 40 feet away on the same floor as the TV.  Set up was relatively easy, but the TV set could be a little better in telling you the status of your connection. I had connected to my router on the first try, but hadn't realized it.  So I kept trying to complete the connection and it kept telling me that all it could find were my neighbor's networks.  Finally I realized it also kept telling me that the network I was on might be a bit slow.  (It isn't, trust me, this, I know) So I tried to get on to Netflix, and son of a gun! it worked!All the confusion aside, once you get the TV set up the way you like, the day to day operation is pretty straight forward and not difficult to use. But getting there could be easier.  Vizio needs to work on the out of box user experience I think.I feel I got a lot for my money, and I would buy it again.  If the users are tech savvy, then they should not hesitate to buy this TV.  But if the users need help setting up a regular tv then they will need someone to help them set this TV up for sure.  But like I said earlier, the day to day operation is pretty easy.  Even grandma should be able to use the set day to day (and even use Netflix and Amazon Prime!)I'm a happy camper with a HUGE TV.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best deal for a TV this size and quality!", "Author": "Jeff Reyes", "ReviewID": "RJWQKM5ZFDB2P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this television for my parents as a Christmas present.

I may also add that passive 3D glasses are cheaper, lighter and also don't require a battery.The screen is a bit reflective, but less so than other LED TVs costing much more.As far as the brand goes, Vizio is considered on the lower end by enthousiasts. Judging by the performace of this set AFTER it is calibrated one can certainly argue that point.I'm hoping it is durable enough to get me by until 4K becomes affordable.I would recommend this TV, but the settings need to be tweeked or you'll be looking to spend hundreds more on another brand to match its size and specs.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product for the price", "Author": "Sunny K", "ReviewID": "R25FE4E0T44E0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good product for the price.

I sometimes feel like I'm watching a play on broadway rather than an actual Hollywood movie. The clarity couldn't be better. I can literally see the pores on people's faces.All of my prior TV's, in my opinion, were thin enough. This TV is so thin, that in order to really get any thinner it would just have to be a screen and that's it. It's about an inch and a half thick.The sound quality is surprisingly not bad. Let's face it, you don't buy a TV for the sound quality. I mean where are they supposed to put the speakers in a TV that is an inch a half thick? Having said that, I can actually turn up the volume to where it's pretty loud (over half way) and it doesn't get distorded like all of my prior TVs did.The best part about the TV, in my opinion, is the fact that it's a smart TV. I love that I can listen to my favorite radio stations on Pandora or flip over to Netflix and watching a movie in stunning HD. I also love the fact that if I'm bored and want to search the web for funny or interesting videos I can do it right there on my TV on a massive 60\" screen rather than my little 16\" laptop.

All I needed to do was be home to allow the shipping company to do there job!  Amazon said that this service is standard from them for the first 30 days of the TV's purchase life.  They also said the 30 days was reset when I got the replacement TV.  That's service!Unfortunately, the second TV suffered from the same issue.  In fact, the issue was even worse!  I again contacted Amazon who is taking care of me.  However, I also, this time, contacted Vizio to see there thoughts.  So far, all they want me to do is keep emailing them pictures of various screen shots showing the TV doing what I say it is doing.  They have not been of any significant help yet.  They said that they may just need to send me a new TV.  I told them I am going to work with Amazon as much as possible because they are much easier to deal with and require less of my time to get me satisfied.I will update this review as soon as we get to the next episode of this conundrum.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceptional picture - strong wifi signal - I love this TV", "Author": "A Guy \"Otis\"", "ReviewID": "R1U142B4KNUK2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first I was a little puzzled with some of the reviews being all over the map, but everyone's entitled to their opinion, so I'll give mine.We've only owned this tv about 2 1/2 weeks now, and I bought a refurbished unit from Amazon's 'little sister' company, so I could try out our first internet ready set without paying full price.I have to say I am very impressed with the picture clarity and all the other features of this 32\" tv so far. Even with our less than spectacular internet connection, and this set being in our bedroom, over 30 feet from the wireless router, and through 3 walls, reception has been spectacular. The picture is twice as good as our 6 yr old Toshiba Regza 42\" set. We use it to stream Netflix content quite a lot, and not only do most shows/movies come through crystal clear, with true color and deep blacks, but Netflix streams about 2x faster than on the larger tv outfitted with a little Magnavox media box, less than  12 feet from the wireless router. The sound quality is acceptable to our ears and another really nice thing is the usb port not only allows movie and personal photo viewing as well as music listening from a flash drive, I discovered that a WD 2 TB external hard drive is recognized and we have the option to play several hundred files from that. Of course it doesn't play all file types, but quite a few. I find the speakers good enough for me to listen to Pandora internet radio in the mornings and to enjoy it. Haven't hooked any periperals up via HDMI as yet, but a DVD player attached to the composite jacks looks excellent, so I imagine the HDMI hook ups should only be better.  If I had one small criticism of this tv it would be the remote is a bit clunky and when pressing the buttons its not as smooth as many others. Button pushes make an audible click, but it does work. This unit only came with a 90 day 3rd party warranty, being a refurb, so I will update this review if there are any changes in performance or our feelings toward it, but so far this is the best set I've ever owned, by a wide margin, and I'll be taking a hard look at the 47\" Vizio when it comes time to replace our Toshiba.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV for the money", "Author": "Aaron C.

I love the built in WiFi and streaming video features, and the quality of the picture is great. It's not cluttered with unnecessary features like many other TVs offering better \"features\". I also feel like the 120hz doesn't upsample too much, like some other TVs, where their high refresh rate passes the 60hz source material (Blu-Rays, DVDs, video games, etc.) and yields an unnaturally fast looking image, making everything look like a daytime soap opera. For whatever reason the 120hz refresh rate on this Vizio feels very natural, but keeps up with fast cut scenes, or action sequences.Also, I wish I had bought this TV on Amazon, it just went on sale for $50 less than I paid for it in-store.

Sauer \"Unix Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R3VSTSGUNNL0Y5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So, to start off, the picture is very good.  The anti-glare treatment on the screen works pretty well, and the off-angle viewing is very good both to the sides and vertically (important if you're, say, mounting this for view in a bedroom where you may be either standing up or laying down while watching).  I also liked the way that the stand attaches and removes, as it doesn't leave a stupid piece sticking out on a wall mount (the necessary allen wrench for attaching/removing the base was included, too).  It's got a nice downward-angled attachment for the power cord and the jacks on the back orient plugs parallel to the wall, so you can mount this quite close to a wall.  The frame also looked nice, though it felt pretty cheap / flimsy.  But how often do you handle a TV? :)However, the primary reason to get a \"smart\" TV is, IMHO, for the smartness.  And this TV is not very smart.  First, to connect this thing to a network, you must agree to some asinine Yahoo! Internet applications terms of service.  How the heck is Yahoo! even relevant anymore?  Whatever.  I had no intention of using Internet apps; I only wanted to view content from my own local network.  But you can't set up the IP address or otherwise connect it to a network until you agree to the click-through agreement.  Fine, I finally gave in and agreed.  Then, once you've done that, you're greeted with a *very* slow to respond set of apps.  Each app takes a fairly long time to load, and there are some pretty useless things on there.  Again, as I mentioned, I only wanted DLNA support to play videos and music from my existing media center network (XBMC on Ubuntu Linux, for the curious).  This POS not only takes *forever* to load the list of content (like, minutes), navigation is terrible.  No artwork is displayed, and, the best part, nearly no formats are supported.  Most all of my video is in mp4 format, which pretty much everything supports.  Not this - everything comes back \"this format is not supported\".  Go to Vizio's web site to find out what's supported, and all they have is a page saying that some formats may not be supported.  There's no list of what is or is not supported, just \"some\".  Ugh.  Look around online at formus, and people are talking about how bad Viso'z DLNA support is.  Granted, it did stream mp3s ok, but again without album art (all of my mp3s are tagged with id3v1 and 2 tags, with embedded album art) - and it was really slow to start playing them (over a nearly idle \"wireless n\" network).  Also, it does not broadcast on the network as a DLNA display device, so you can't do things like have your phone auto-discover the TV and play back to it.  It's a very, *very* minimal DLNA device with a sketchy implmentation of what they actually did finish (e.g, UTF support is broken, certain headers cause the TV to crash, etc).For what it's worth, I also used the Amazon instant video app.  While that app technically works, it also doesn't work well.  It does not provide access to your \"watchlist\", so you have to search for things you marked on something like a Roku or a better device.  There's no indication of video quality or now long it'll take to initially buffer, so if you're on a slow link, you just watch a wait cursor for however long it takes to get a video started.  It takes longer than necessary to navigate through available videos.  In summary, the Vizio Amazon app is unsurprisingly as poorly designed and unresponsive as the Vizio DLNA support.I returned the item indicating that it did not match the description on the page.  The product description says it's a DLNA-compatible smart TV, but that's like saying a child's tricycle is a car on the basis that it has more than two tires.  I bought a Samsung UN32EH5300 to replace it.  Sure, the Samsung was $100 more, but everything actually works on the Samsung.  Even the VESA mount is better; the Vizio mount used some really tiny metric bolts which were a different length on the top and the bottom, while the Samsung uses much more substantial bolts.  The Samsung's DLNA support is also way better; much faster loading (on the same network) and a better interface.  Also, there was no stupid clickthrough privacy agreement on the Samsung. :)With all that said, if you just want in inexpensive 32\" LCD, the Vizio is not bad; it has a really good picture, and the remote isn't enormous.  But if you actually intend to use the \"smart\" features at all -- especially DLNA -- keep looking; I suggest the Samsung.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Top of class", "Author": "Wayne Matthes \"movie collector\"", "ReviewID": "R26A3M6CUD88UU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely great picture.

It took me 3 minutes to figure out that i didn't have to change anything. I love that.I'm using my harmony universal remote with it with very good results.This TV would get 5 stars from me if it weren't for 2 little things: * I wish the DLNA support was better. Not many people use this and maybe I should just give up. This TV's DLNA support is not good. It picks up my server, but won't play much of anything reliably. * I really wish the screen border was matte instead of glossy.

Your mileage may vary, and I certainly understand that they did me a favor, but I was impressed. Amazon knows how to keep their customers happy.

I would have preferred Amazon but the competition had the better deal that day.The picture is unbelievable. At some times it looks almost 3D or that you're looking out a window instead of into a screen. I won't even consider another brand than Vizio after seeing this tv. As far as I can see the picture is as good or better than a Sony or LG or any other brand costing several hundreds more for the same size screen but fewer features or inputs.I only have 2 gripes. One is the sound. The volume range is 0-100 and I usually have mine set in the 40-50 range to understand what people are saying and i'm directly in front of the tv at 10 feet yet when I go into the adjoining rooms I hear and understand the speech much better? My guess is the ultra thin design just doesn't make for good speakers or speaker placement. It's like the speakers were put in facing the back or something. Lastly that on non HD programs I sometimes see thin white horizontal lines like bits of string at the very top of the screen that move left and right and change width with the movement of the show. This may be a defect with my particular tv I will be taking this up with Vizio support. But I can elliminate the problem by simply switching to the HD version of that channel...lines gone. And why would I want to watch/record a show in 480I if it's available in 1080I (cable DVR's display only 1080I to save bandwidth. To get 1080P you need Satellite DVR's I want G4 and AMC so I'm stuck with 1080I cable) anyways and 90% of what I watch is on networks with HD available.UPDATE: The white line issue was a senior moment on my part. This is my 1st Flat screen TV all I had to compare it with was PC monitors and my laptop. I was unaware you could adjust the screen left/right/up/down These features are greyed out and unusable on my PC monitor. moving the screen just 2 points vertical eliminated the white lines. So I am upgrading the TV to 5 stars.About support; Vizio is outstanding. I made a call when the tv arrived because it was very cold outside and wanted to know if I needed to let the tv acclamate to inside temp before turning it on. My wait time was less than 5 minutes and I actually got to speak to a very pleasant person who could actually speak ENGLISH for a change!!! No outsourced support with an Indian guy named \"Bob\" and an accent so thick you can cut it with a knife speaking through a crappy scratchy sounding headset. Clear crisp English that I had no problem understanding with my tinnitus. It was a pleasure to speak with them instead of a chore asking them to repeat every other word over and over again.UPDATE regarding support. I think it's also worth noting that Vizio reads customer reviews and comments and attempts to resolve any issue a customer puts in his comments at least on walmart.com. That just shows their level of commitment to their customers. I am just blown away by the quality of support I see and have received.I wish I could give this TV and Vizio a 4.5 out of 5 instead of just a 4.Because the white line issue was my ignorance and not the TV I raised my review to 5 stars. I don't like to give 5 star \"perfect\" reviews because so many customers default to 5 stars or 1 and that's an emotional reaction not an accurate rating of the product. Like it automatic perfect 5 one small issue and people hit it with a 1 out of anger not taking into account the good things about it or the issue could be with them and not the product as was with me an the white line issue. I would prefer to rate items like PC software is rated. I would give it a 96/100 because I'm still having audio issues with hearing but not understanding speech when I'm in front of the TV yet hearing it fine from the sides or rear of the set even from another room. I'm listening at 45 and my poor wife who's trying to take a nap is getting blasted with like a 75 in the bedroom 25 feet away.

As the title suggests, the TV lacks brightness, I have never seen such a dim LED screen on another TV. At first, it was completely awful, ANY source of light reflected on the screen and made it impossible to make out any detail on the video behind that light. My parents have a small lamp on an end table with a 40 Watt bulb in it, which was covered with a lamp shade and still caused this, no matter where you sat in the room.However, once you go into the setting and turn OFF the ambient light sensor, \"Luma\" setting, and Auto dimming, it's not nearly as bad. It's still not great, but even during the day with some sunlight on the screen it is possible to watch something and see what is on the screen. So the auto-dimming feature is basically so aggressively trying to save power, it dims the screen too much (or maybe it just can't accurately tell how bright the room is). Again, once you turn off all those features it's much better, probably a 4 Star viewing experience, though the power use will be MUCH higher than normal with those features off.So why the 2 Star review then? The first TV my parents bought was the 47 inch version, and they loved it. They especially liked the smart TV features and only bought the 50 inch version because with the black Friday special it was 3 inches more screen for 50 dollars LESS money.However, the first 50 inch TV they got had a faulty wi-fi adapter in it, so none of the smart TV features would actually work. They called Vizio and Vizio's support rep was completely unable to help resolve the issue. He told them that the TV needed to be only 25 ft away from the router at most because if they put higher quality wi-fi adapters in the TV's it would cost 600 dollars more for the TV (which they got for 500)! They explained that they had basically the same TV and it worked in the same spot, and he continued to assure them that Vizio uses junk parts to save money and it wasn't going to work no matter what.They took the bad TV back to the store and haven't had any problems yet with the new set. So the lesson here is that if you call Vizio with a warranty issue, they will likely tell you \"Of course it doesn't work, we use cheap parts\".

The user interface (UI) installed on the Vizio E320i-A0 is Vizio's crippled Yahoo! TV Apps/M-GO interface, NOT the company's \"Vizio Internet Apps Plus\" interface.  It is clunky, frustrating, limited, and NOT user friendly.  While the TV is just fine as standard TV or monitor, and has a decent picture, adequate sound, and plenty of inputs, the UI is terrible and the remote is almost worthless.  It is not a good value as it comes at a premium over a similarly appointed HD set, and you can save nearly a C-note and a whole bunch of frustration if you simply buy a \"dumb\" 32-inch HD set and a Roku LT from Amazon.I purchased this TV in January 2013 on Vizio's promise that it would provide an outstanding Smart TV experience.  It was anything BUT outstanding.  Its primary app, \"M-GO\" (prominently displayed on both the unit's UI home screen and its lousy remote control), was billed as a \"revolutionary\" TV experience when I purchased the TV.  Bizarrely, M-GO wasn't installed on the TV at the time of purchase and didn't even become available for it until Summer 2013.  When it finally did arrive via Vizio's eventual firmware update, M-GO turned out to be all \"pay\" TV - no included content.  It was thoroughly disappointing and not \"revolutionary\" as promised.  I already have Netflix and Amazon Prime, so I don't need their lousy pay app.  Aside from M-GO, there are other apps available for the E320i-A0 -- some are preinstalled like Yahoo! Finance and Skype, but most are downloaded through the Yahoo! TV Apps store in the unit's poorly structured UI.  Strangely, Yahoo! TV Apps offers only a very limited number of apps for this \"smart\" TV -- a grand total of 134 (that's right:  ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR!) as of this writing on December 26, 2013 -- and most of them are either local news station apps from distant corners of the U.S., or paid anime/cartoon channels. Even the familiar apps like iHeart Radio have limited feature sets and don't offer the programmable, personalized channels you would customarily be able to set up on your computer or smart phone, but rather offer only a specified set of broadcast stations from select markets.  The entire experience is really bizarre.Ultimately, the greatest disappointment of the E320i-A0 is its abysmal UI and limited apps, which Vizio flatly informed me it has no intention to update to its current \"VIA Plus\" interface.  Again, the TV is good in terms of picture, size, sound and inputs, but the \"smart\" content is worthless.  If you buy this TV you will be stuck with the lousy UI, crappy remote, and crippled apps.

HD programs were crisp and clear in 720P. However, after adjusting the picture setting in the menu to my preferences the picture quality is now very good to excellent.  I definitely recommend turning off all the automatic picture enhancement features then, adjusting the settings back to your own personal taste. There are a couple of older reviews that can help with that chore. Its worth the effort.The built in WiFi works well for using Netflix or Amazon prime programs.  Set up was fairly easy on the WiFi. I am also impressed with the built-in audio. The speakers are louder and better than the older 32\" LCD this one replaced. The remote is very basic and has small buttons which could be a problem for some people. The remote buttons also do not illuminate.So far the only thing I was not impressed with was the flimsy, light weight, stand.  It also does not much of a footprint compared to the older 32\" TV stands it replaced (also a Vizio). So stability could be a concern with the stand that comes with the set.

The built-in apps are all you really need but you can add and delete apps (yes, it's actually possible to delete the useless Yahoo apps). You do have to sign up for the Yahoo app store but that's painless. I had no trouble at all getting the TV to recognize my WiFi network, and connecting it to Netflix and Amazon Prime couldn't be easier.The slim-bezel design ensures that none of the picture gets cut off. Of the brands I shopped before buying this TV and experience with friends' TVs, Vizio and Samsung seem to be the best at not chopping the bottom of the screen off. Panasonic and LG cut off a significant portion of the picture on all sides, and Magnavox cuts off quite a bit too.TV reception is solid, the tuner has all the latest DTV technology and it has no trouble with my indoor antenna. Fast-motion shots in football games can be problematic if your local station has any sub-channels eating up their bandwidth but as long as the source signal isn't compressed too much you won't notice any artifacts. Picture quality is incredibly sharp and the built-in speakers are all most people will ever need but it does support external audio devices if you are a surround-sound aficionado.The coolest thing about the Amazon Prime app is that while you're searching on the left side of the screen for the video you want to watch, the live TV picture scales down to the remaining 75% of the screen on the right so you can browse for the latest Downton Abbey episodes while your local meteorologist talks about the weather. Of the video-streaming apps on this TV, the Amazon Prime app is the best.Netflix comes in a close second. Navigation is easy and video quality is second to none, as long as the video is available for 720p or 1080p. Some TV shows that were produced in HD are only available on NF in 480p resolution, but the TV handles those well. I was actually surprised when I was watching a David Tennant-era Doctor Who episode and the TV reported that it was only receiving a 480p stream from NF.The YouTube app is kind of clunky but when it's playing videos it plays them back without any problems, and you can sign in to your YouTube account so you can use the website to find videos and put them in your Watch Later list, then get to them from the TV without having to deal with the app's search function.The only app I was disappointed with was Hulu Plus. The video was washed out, and the sound was tinny. I hooked up the Xbox and played the same video using that Hulu app and the video and sound quality were great, so this is a fault with the Hulu Plus app for Vizio. I contacted Hulu support and they were not helpful. Most of what I wanted to watch they still don't have rights to stream to TV or mobile devices so I canceled my free trial anyway. Therefore the Hulu app's shortcomings are a non-issue for me. If you want to use Hulu and have a game console or other streaming device, use that for Hulu, not the TV's Hulu app.The media player app can stream videos, music and photos from your PC running media-streaming software such as TVersity. Combined with Windows Media Center (free) and a TV tuner card, I've made this my DVR.This is by far the best TV I have ever owned.

After much debating, I took a gamble and went with my gut with this 47\" Vizio Smart tv.The first problem was with the shipping. I ordered this through Amazon Prime, the amount of time it took to arrive was great, 2 days just as expected. The problem was upon seeing the box there was a HUGE hole that was larger than the diameter of a baseball bat. My nerves went through the roof with the hole seeming severe. I took the actual tv out of the shipping box and noticed a hole in it. The hole was smaller, maybe the size of a half dollar. Which doesn't make sense when compared to the size of the hole in the shipping box. I removed the tv and was fortunate that the holes were on the backside, and there wasn't a scratch (miraculously) on the backside of the tv even. I am really hesitant to purchase a tv online anymore after this experience.After removing it the set up was simple. The stand screws in easily with 3 screws. The only thing I don't like about the stand is that it doesn't swivel. With a 47\" tv you don't need to swivel much so it's not a major concern, but it would be nice to have easier access to the HDMI ports and such. I was amazed that this 47\" tv is A LOT lighter than my previous 32\" HDTV that was purchased 7 years ago that I was replacing.The onscreen set up was easy. I am still trying to adjust picture settings to get a good picture because it's just not too great for me out of the box. Shouldn't be a big deal to keep tweaking the custom setting. I have Verizon Fios connected through HDMI. I am a big NHL fan so immediately I turned on Center Ice. I notice there is a little lag with the players. Maybe its my eyes just not used to this size of a screen. I'll give it some time to adjust. I wouldn't expect lag with it being (supposedly) 120hz.I checked out some of the apps. I tried Netflix but kept getting errors and couldn't even have a chance to sign in to my account. I tried Hulu and it worked perfectly. I tried netflix again, still nothing.

I'm using the television on the included base, not wall mounted, and I will say that it is a little bit wobbly. They should have provided two mounting points on the base instead of one for a screen this size.My main complaint is that the Amazon streaming app is absolutely terrible.  For something that is so boldly advertised on the product page, it is just embarrassingly bad. The app opens in a tiny sidebar taking up a quarter of the left hand side of the screen at most, and lacks basic functionality that is standard in every other available streaming app, and even in the Amazon app available for any other platform that I've used it on (Xbox360, PS3, WiiU).  There is no access to a watchlist of any sort and absolutely no way to see your recently watched videos (making it impossible to pick up where you left off in a series for example).  The lack of any sort of a real, full screen navigational interface is a huge oversight, and makes it extraordinarily painful to navigate, even on a 70\" screen.  You could blame this on the ability of the TV itself to handle a fully featured app if it weren't for the Netflix app available for the TV that works pretty well and has all of the features that you would expect.Maybe I was foolish to plan on using the Vizio streaming apps to replace those on my consoles (which I was planning to move to a different part of the house), but I really didn't expect the offerings to be this terrible.

TV is large, sharp, and glare is minimal (although there is not much sunlight in the room we mounted it in).  The sound quality was not great, but a Vizio sound bar did the trick.  We were amazed how light weight the TV was for the size when we wall-mounted it (~50lbs without the stand).

Morgan \"Jim@HiTek\"", "ReviewID": "R1XHY75C3FRFAL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was a little hesitant to buy a Vizio TV after the experience I had with one of their 55\" LCD units. The pic was great and all but the software was soooo sucky. It was totally annoying having to reconfigure it whenever you turned it on since it always switched back to the default settings instead of keeping the current. 'Nuff said about it.Some of the dumb things you find with modern TVs these days is a delay after changing channels. You'll get a blue screen for 2-3 seconds (even some older Vizio's do this), followed by the sound a couple seconds later. There is no reason for this, other then bad design. This Vizio did away with that silliness so when you change channels, it's virtually instant. Sound comes along for the ride and it's on instantly too. Even when switching to a pixelated picture it's happy to go there, without the annoyance of jumping back to the previous channel like some TVs and VCR/DVD players do.The picture is great even at wide angles (though you loose some brightness), and although I'll need to have an articulated wall mounting device to allow 25\u00b0 tilt so I can watch either from my desk, or while lying down on the couch, I'd say that most won't have a problem with the viewing angles.In my small RV, it's a pleasure to have such a wide TV...compared to the old CRT 19\" it replaced. The thin screen surround (3/4\") is thin enough that it disappears into the background. And at only 22\" wide, it fits perfectly over my existing cabinetry without any extensive alterations or interfering with the cabinet doors on either side. Though I will do some cabinet mods at a later date.The WiFi feature was an added bonus at the price paid for this unit, and although it requires a pretty strong, local signal, once it's up and working, it's nice and stable. But if the signal is down to 2-3 bars, it tends to lose it. Then sometimes it doesn't even show the AP it was just connected to as available until you turn off the TV and back on. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.The built-in internet software favors commercial sources (the remote has direct keys for Amazon, Netflix, and M-Go, then there are several more commercial or pay-to-use sources, like Hulu, shown at the bottom of the screen when you press the VIA button on the remote) and although I haven't figured out how to just enter a URL yet, I expect I'll be able to. Haven't tried the Cat5 direct connection yet either. One thing they missed is that when entering the passcode, the typical cell phone shows upper case for the first entry and goes to lower case after you enter the first letter. The Vizio starts at lower case so you have to walk down to the control to set it up for upper. A minor annoyance as I find most passcodes start with uppercase. Strangely, when you need to enter a password into say, Netflix, the on-screen keyboard DOES work like a phone. Showing upper case first, then auto-switching to lower case after the first entry.The input sources available are more then just adequate, though I would have liked to connect via S-Video (no connector for that). Instead, I hooked up my computer and my VCR/DVD recorder/player via both HDMI and AV and the TV worked flawlessly. Push the remotes 'Input' button and a scrollable window pops up without blacking out the current picture...I like that. I also like that the picture scrunches up on the right side when you press menu, which shows up in a nicely readable box on the left taking up 1/3 of the screen. Navigation with the remote is fairly easy tho some keys could be larger, like the 'Mute' button. And the default settings for color, brightness and the like are perfect for me.Even the sound is better then expected. I will be going to a sound bar soon for improved dynamic range, but this TV is pretty good as it stands. Especially if it's sitting on a hard surface to reflect some of the sound from the front firing speakers and the passive rear grill openings.As a full time RV'er, it was a pleasure to find a TV like this that has such an easy to use 'Available Channel' scanning system. Many are so slow or have user unfriendly multiple pages as to be annoying. This Vizio is easy to use but as far as scanning speed goes it is about average, taking 5:45 to find 29 digital OTA channels. I am in a fringe area so that may have added some time to the scan. Haven't tried it on cable yet and I'm hoping for a faster scan with that typically stronger signal.For the price, feature set, and the quality, you would be hard pressed to find something that would beat the Vizio E241i-A1. For RV'ers who don't want to do extensive remodeling of their cabinetry, it's darn near perfect.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "K.

The picture is crisp, and the colors are pretty good. The sound from the built in speakers is good too, but nothing special, pretty much just what I was expecting.But the main reason for purchasing this TV was for it's affordable price for being a smart TV. It was easy setting up the wireless connection, just needed to point it to the right network and punch the password and viola! I mainly used it for Netflix and the picture brought down from Netflix was pristine. But I eventually started running into trouble with it constantly dropping the WiFi connection. To fix it I had to restart the whole TV. I even went into my router's settings and made sure that there was no chance that anything in the router would mess it up, but it still consistently dropped the connection (and it doesn't seem like I'm the only one). So I ended up buying a Google Chromecast to plug into it (USB port in this TV works for supplying power to the Chromecast), and the Chromecast has worked flawlessly. Hasn't dropped a connection once, which should be embarrassing for Vizio that a tiny $35 HDMI dongle can outperform the streaming capabilities of a 32-inch TV set.Though I wish the connection was stable, it was still a decent buy. It was a fairly cheap price for a TV of pretty good quality, although I would recommend just getting a TV without wireless streaming and spend the money you save on a Chromecast (if you have a smartphone or tablet, that is).", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio 39\" TV", "Author": "Jonathan E.

Here are the problems I'm having...1. When the screen goes black momentarily between scenes, I can make out a slight trace of the previous scene on the dark screen before the next scene, only mildly annoying. I've tried visual adjustments in settings, nothing fixes this.2. There isn't any 'Over the air' antenna digital information on programs. It will sometimes display what is currently playing, sometimes... An old generic 42\" lcd I have displays listings for channels several hours in advance for the shows through 'Over the air' free digital channel broadcast. The worst thing about this problem is when I called Vizio about it, the person just gave me a dismissive techno savvy response suggesting 'WHAT STONE-AGE DINOSAUR STILL USES OVER THE AIR SIGNALS???!!!'. I'm being a little dramatic, but it still rubbed me the wrong way.3. Netflix screws up every other time I use it on this tv, the only way to fix the problem is by turning off and back on the television, otherwise Netflix will stay frozen and not finish loading. Though it takes longer for Amazon instant video to load, it never has this problem. In all fairness, this could have more to due with my router not being a newer model designed for streaming.4. When turning on my tv after being off a while, there will be a few second delay before the tv responds to the remote control commands, this has only happened occasionally though.5. Often the volume up down, channel up down buttons on the remote control will get stuck, this sometimes causes me to fly past the channel I wanted to watch.Though sounding like a grouch, I'd rate this as 3 1/2 stars, the problems are almost always seldom or minor and the pros have mostly outweighed the cons.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good but not Great", "Author": "Jay Meeks", "ReviewID": "R277VNPZS1BJIS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only had the TV for two months but so far I have been satisfied with this product.

I know many times I'll cut the TV on in the morning or while my kid is sleeping on the couch and I mute it because it's so loud, but it's still going to be loud when I turn it down, but with this TV I don't have that problem.* The apps pop up on the side when you select them and you can size your screen to where it doesn't cut it off while you're looking for something.* The slim frame makes it seem as if it's floating in the dark, you feel like you're at the theater.Picture:The quality is extremely good with HDMI, the streaming through WI-FI, and an antenna. With sports there is a big difference in this and the 60 hz, plus it has settings to make it even better. It takes a while for it to come on (compared to other TV's) as others have said, but honestly, why is everyone in such a hurry for their TV to come on? Are you really that impatient to where you can't wait 60 secs for TV when you're probably going to watch at least 30 mins?Apps:The only ones I really use are the Netflix and Amazon. Netflix is laid out the same as my PS3 and I like that, but it does seem to buffer slower and takes a while to get a clear  picture. The Amazon app, doesn't have a place to select your watchlist (that I've found) so you have to search or dig for anything you want to watch. I'll probably use my PS3 more for Amazon, but it is convenient to not have to turn on a separate device. Youtube works good playing from the phone most of the time and I really like that feature. I'll update on other apps once I've used more, but haven't had a chance or need yet.Antenna:It was easy to set up and scan for channels and the picture quality was amazing, not to mention I get better reception with it. It actually tells you what is on local channels, how long it will be on, and gives a short description, just like cable or satellite would.Sound:This is one spot where the TV doesn't hold up well against others. The sound isn't terrible it's just not great. I will definitely invest in a sound bar as soon as I can. The speakers are on the bottom BTW. UPDATE: If you change the sound from Surround to standard it sounds much less distorted and is still plenty loud enough.Stand:I used a wall mount, but the stand seemed very solid and was very heavy so I think it would have done just fine.Remote:I like the convenience of the Netflix button and Amazon Prime button and the buttons are easy to read and it's laid out fairly well. It's small and light and points very easily. You can have it facing any where near the TV and it will work.Hook ups:The hook ups are easy to get to on the side (which is good if you want to plug something in temporarily like a phone or computer) and even though the ones that are facing downward are hard to reach it makes it where if you're mounting to the wall you can get it very flush. There are more than enough hook ups to fit just about anyone's needs.Overall, I couldn't find a TV that beat this one for the features and price and I couldn't be happier.

Why is Amazon now combining all kinds of different size and model Vizio TVs in this single review thread? This is a disservice to users. It is confusing and inefficient.===========================================================================This 29 inch Vizio TV is the perfect size for viewing when the TV is sitting just beyond the foot-of-the-bed. The slim profile and light weight makes it easy to fit into tighter spaces without sacrificing quality or comfortable viewing.The TV is capable of remarkable color and clarity. However, it did take me a while to customize the settings for optimal color and picture quality. The default setup does not reflect the picture potential that is available with careful tweaking.My personal preference (your mileage/taste may vary):Advanced Picture -> Color Enhancement -> GM/BlueAdvanced Picture -> Luma -> MediumAdvanced Picture -> Backlight Control -> OffColor Temperature -> CoolPicture Mode -> Custom-- backlight -> 41-- brightness -> 37-- contrast -> 42-- color -> 51-- tint -> -2-- sharpness -> 10The remote control (RC-29\") took some getting used to. I often like to control with \"feel\" instead of sight. Since the RC-29\" thickness is uniform and the top and bottom are both rounded, it is easy to grab the remote in the dark and not know immediately whether you are holding it from the top or bottom. In contrast, the RC from my other Vizio 16\" TV is, in most respects, more ergonomic. The RC-16\" was longer so buttons were more spread out and easier to locate in the dark. The RC-16\" also had a smooth battery bump on the back, making it much easier to determine top and bottom in the dark. I would have just used the old RC-16\" to control my 29\" Vizio except that the RC-29\" had channel numbers at the very bottom, making it easier to select channels by \"feel\" than via the RC-16\".I also use a tiny $60 Android/TV box about the size of a fat harmonica that connects to one of the two Vizio HDMI ports. It gives me full internet web access (via wi-fi) and access to plenty of great apps, essentially a small Android 4.2.2 computer using the TV as a 1280x720 pixel monitor. Although this box is capable of being powered by the Vizio USB port, I prefer to use an external powered USB hub. My favorite app is the XBMC media player allowing me to easily access, via wi-fi, my notebook's USB hard drive's 1TB of movies, MP3s, and various other media files.LINK: hypercube.us/forum/index.php?topic=1202.0The Vizio E291i-A1 29 inch HDTV would be a great deal even without its wi-fi capabilities.

I selected this model based on the Amazon reviews, then bounced over to Conzumer Reportz and found that it was one of the top rated models in this size.  Based on my first week's use, I have to agree with both the Amazon and CR reviewers.  The TV is super light weight, and therefore a breeze to mount on a wall (it also comes with a plastic \"foot\" that lets you set it on a cabinet or table if you want).  Setup was very simple -- it connected to my router through the built-in WiFi connection, and registering the TV to my online media accounts (e.g., Amazon Prime for TV/movies) took a matter of seconds.  The picture quality is very good -- better than I expected for this price.  The sound is OK -- good for a second TV, but if I planned to watch a lot of movies on this set I'd probably hook it up to better speakers.  The web content apps (Amazon Prime, YouTube, Netflix, etc.) work well and easily, but the load times are significantly slower than on my PC, and typing on the on-screen soft keyboard is slow.  The TV does not have a general purpose browser, so you're limited to the apps Vizio supports.  The Sony Blu-ray player I hooked up the Vizio TV has a browser, so the lack of a browser in the TV set itself wasn't a big deal for me, but I wish it were clearer in the product description (references to Internet and WiFi led me to assume I could get onto the Internet from the TV).Bottom line:  A very good quality picture, OK sound, with built-in wifi and easy-to-use apps, all for around two fifty make this an exceptional value.

It's way up there, maybe in the 10-12Khz range.  I don't know why it's there, and I've considered using the square trade protection plan to see if someone will come here to fix it.  I'm not going to bother shipping it anywhere.There is also another factor I'm none too crazy about; but this isn't specific to the unit, itself, rather to all new 16:9 aspect ratio televisions.  If something is in the old 4:3 aspect ratio, it looks fine on this (or any 16:9) screen, because it fills the screen from top to bottom, and, obviously, goes only as wide as 4/3rds of the height.  But very few things are displayed anymore in the old aspect ratio, except for commercials.  Almost everything is in a new aspect ratio that is NOT proportional to screen size.  This new format seems to be some sort of hybrid meant to work, more or less, with both aspect ratios.If you zoom in, you get full width, but part of the top and bottom of the picture is cropped off.  This is usually (but not always) ok for viewing.  But if you are zoomed and using the menu of your cable box to see what else is on, the very bottom of the screen (for my CSP) shows the date; and that date is gone.  Zooming can also be a problem with subtitles.  The date is always cut off, and  subtitles are often cropped too when zoomed, forcing a change in aspect ratio to normal, which then reduces the size of the image on screen with a lot of wasted space on the sides, and a bit less waste at the top and bottom.  That is an annoyance.  But, as stated, this is by no means a problem unique to this particular unit.I'll be replacing this 32\" unit with a 3rd (38.5\"--\"39,\" nominal) HDTV, and relegating this unit to my spare bedroom, where it will rarely be watched or heard at all; and, if/when it is watched, it will be from much closer so that the smaller picture won't matter nearly as much.  I'm also replacing a 37\" unit, from another manufacturer, in my living room that's not quite 2 years old, because of this aspect ratio problem.  Both of these units will be a bit larger (wider) than I'd like, but they will fit in the areas I have available for them and should solve the screen Image-size problem.I was going to go with another Vizio (so I don't dislike the brand), but I was unable to find a single Vizio that has two inputs for older styles of video equipment, Component AND AV.  That led me to go with 41.9\" (42,\" nominal) unit from the same manufacturer as the 37\" unit I'm replacing, because that one does have TWO inputs for things that aren't HD.How much could it cost per unit to include two of the old style inputs, instead of just one?  I have old VCRs, a DVD Player and a Blue Ray player hooked up to the 37\" unit.  All I'll have to do is unplug everything from the 37\" T.V. and plug it all back into the new 42\" T.V.  Nothing needs to change in terms of how it's plugged into my home entertainment amplifier.In both cases (the 37\" and the 32\" HDTVs) I was replacing old 4:3 aspect ratio T.V.s.  Two years ago I was replacing a 3:4 27\" with the 37\" HD; and, a few months ago I replaced 3:4 25\" with the 32\" HD.  One thing you never see in the stores where they try to sell you these new things, is a smaller picture framed by black.  But that's what you get with these new T.V.s and that \"hybrid\" format--unless you zoom in, which is by no means without its problems.Go with at least a 37\" to replace an old 3:4 25\" T.V.  I went with a 38.5\" Vizio to replace the 32,\" because the newest, sleekest designs by Vizio seem to weigh less than comparably priced T.V.s by competitors and have a narrower width, overall, because there is only a very narrow frame around the screen.  And go for a 42\" to replace a 3:4 27.\"  For the same viewing distance this should keep image size about the same for broadcasts in the newer format, without the need to zoom.  Things broadcast in the old 3:4 format will be very much larger with only some wasted space on the sides, but the entire signal will appear on your screen.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "The TV is a masterful piece", "Author": "greeneink", "ReviewID": "R3FXAX8GOEY02Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a Prime member, I got $10 off, but it is well worth the price and works well with a wifi hub.

It could not pick up some channels. But for those channels it can receive, the picture is stable and sharp. I noticed the TV programs received over the air have the 720p to 1080i resolutions. But from a Blu Ray dvd player, I can get the 1080p signal, and then, the picture quality is really  marvelous. The remote control is a little bit sluggish.

I plan to connect the sound output of the TV to an audio amplifier with better speakers to correct this problem. The network connection feature is good. I enjoy watching HD footage from Youtube.

The tv arrived quickly (thanks Amazon Prime), package was undamaged and I waiting a couple days before I installed it. I set it up and it seemed as if all was fine. A couples days later I noticed a stuck pixel towards the upper left corner. I was hoping it would go away after a few on off cycles, but several days later it was still stuck in the purple mode. Then one night while watching a program, I went to adjust the volume but it didn't work, I then tried the channel up/down button and got no response. I tried to turn it off and could not...even tried the off button on the side. I had to unplug the tv and reconnect power before things would work again. I notified Amazon and it was an amazingly painless process to return the tv and get a replacement. The new Vizio E320i-AO arrived in 2 days and I removed the first one from the wall and set up the second. Now, this is where I noticed a difference. Even though both televisions had the exact same model numbers on the back, there were differences between the 2. The first was lighter, had buttons on the upper left side and the energy sticker said $6 a year average cost to operate. The second was a bit heavier, had a thicker plastic back (I had to buy longer M4 screws to attach to the same wall mount brackets). The buttons on the second tv were on the lower left side and the energy sticker indicated $8 per year average to operate. I decided to look at images of the Vizio E320i-AO online and all that I could find were the same as the second tv that I got. Even the box for the second tv was different than the first one. I don't understand, unless Amazon was trying to get rid of old stock??? Amazon, can you answer that one? Amazon also offered me $30 credit if I would keep the  defective first tv...which I declined.Now for the review of the second set. It works perfectly, the colors are great, the remote never fails and the Vizio apps are pretty good. CNET's review was spot on for the TV, I suggest you watch it. The backlit LED is nice, but it does make the TV a bit thicker....but who watches from the side? Hanging it the wall is easy as the tv is less than 20lbs. Viewing angles are decent and I haven't noticed and blurring or tearing, but really haven't watched anything that would really test it either. The wireless connection works extremely well for me, but I also connected a wireless router to my LAN just to serve the tv. The sound is adequate, but I would like to get a sound bar with a wireless sub...that would make this tv a 10 out of 10.Overall, I am quite pleased with the television and would indeed recommend this set to others who want a 32\" tv in a smaller room or perhaps a bedroom.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just got it", "Author": "Jim Deli", "ReviewID": "R1LOT39EE8I8KJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality is quite a step up from my old 35 inch TV.

I am sure under lab conditions with actual electronic testing equipment that this one would not compete well with more expensive sets, but for a casual viewer just watching television it is incredible.  We were all blown away the first time we watched the 1970's show Gilligan's Island on this set via Netflix.  You feel like you are looking out of a window instead of watching television.  I have no idea how they can make a 40 year old show look so realistic, but it really is impressive. In fact, at times it looks almost 3D it is so realistic (although this is not a 3D set).  The only weakness that this television has is that the speakers are not very loud, so we usually turn on a sound bar that we had previously purchased from Walmart.  The sound bar supplements the TV speakers very well, especially with the high frequency sounds.  With the bottom/back mounted speakers of the TV the sounds are a little muffled sounding, but the sound bar completely correct that.

So, then I called Vizio, they checked my connection and tell me that it's strong and my TV is working fine. Vizio did mention that because Internet TVs are new, the servers aren't as good as what you would get in a computer or even a game console. As a result, even if an app like Netflix is running fine on your computer you may have problems on the TV (especially if you have a lot of devices hooked up to your Internet, which I do).

My previous Vizio 50\" plasma TV was very reliable, so I decided to try this one based on its positive reviews and it doesn't disappoint. The screen is absolutely massive, yet the TV itself doesn't feel excessively heavy. Heat output is minimal as well.The picture is essentially what you make of it - there are so many adjustments and such fine grain control over the many filters, motion engine features and such that you can tune the picture to look exactly as you want it to. The noise reduction features can adapt perfectly to the source, be it old grainy film, games or TV shows. I'm also unable to detect any bright spots on the panel either, a common problem with LED/LCD TVs. The contrast ratio is very good, not quite plasma levels but the picture is so stable that I prefer it over the heat and reliability issues I've had with plasmas in the past.The \"smart TV\" features are also pretty cool. The interface is pretty clunky in some areas, but I consider these features to be extras and I don't base my purchasing decisions on them. The TV has a USB interface that allows you to play back some types of media, but I noticed that MKV files don't play.

When I first started with Comcast, I had seen one Vizio fail after another and swore to never to buy one. Samsung TV's always were so solid with rarely any issues at all. However, over the years I have seen Vizio TV's become more of a popular brand with many people recommending the brand to me. After seeing this TV in Best Buy for the same price as on Amazon, I decided to go for it. I will admit, I was furious when I was getting the HDMI audio-lip sync problem right off the bat when I started watching it. I knew it wasn't a cable box issue because I just swapped from my Samsung 50 inch LED to the new one with no issues before. Looking at the bad reviews, I learned that the old firmware was the source of the issue and after 2 days of waiting, I turned on the TV with the message: \"Your firmware has been updated to 1.1.5\". Since then, absolutely NO issues whatsoever, the picture rivals if not BEATS my Samsung LED!

Shipping was free quick and easy, was delivered right into my apartment with no problems. Waited 4 hours before turning it on due to the temperature adjustment then began setting it up.  Before this I had a 42 inch Dynex and when I set up this new TV I was blown away at how much bigger it is, the difference between 42\" and 60\" really is bigger then you'd think.  Make sure you can be at least 6 feet away from the TV when watching, or else you'll feel like you're in the first row at the movie theater. The picture is great, incredibly clear and sharp when watching blu rays or even playing 720p games.  Sadly when watching HD cable it doesn't look as good (though not bad) but that is because HD tv is in 1080i and not 1080p like a blu ray is. A number of people have complained that the speakers in the TV suck or are no good, but I actually find them to be just fine, and since the TV is so big, the two built in speakers are pretty spread out so you get a full sound (though I do recommend buying or using additional surround sound speakers for the added benefit of a sub and more power).I didn't set up or use any of the internet apps because come on, that's not why I bought the TV and I have a laptop, phone and PS3 to do all that on. The remote is good enough, and the interface to use while messing with all the settings on the TV is real easy.  The only complaint I can think of about the TV is when you have the backlighting on (which you don't need on if you turn off the ambient light sensor) and the screen is totally black, you can see some kind of uneven lighting at the edges of the screen. This bothered/freaked me out at first because I saw other people complaining about this issue, but as I said before, just turn off the backlighting and it goes away, and even if you don't turn off the backlighting, as soon as something comes on the screen that isn't completely all black, it's gone.The smooth motion (120hz) looks awesome once you get used to it, but some people just don't like it so luckily you can turn it off easily in the picture menu.

Well, black are blacks and Downton Abbey is dark show (a lot of dark rooms and black suits) and I used it to tune in the color (black level).  Overall, black level is fine with me.  I could tell from one episode to another that Downton Abbey changes the lighting in each room.  Overall, black level is not an issue with me.  Watching any TV show, sport, or Movie will not disappoint.  The TV show Survivor is so vivid you might as well be there on the beach with them.  Now if TV channel isn't High Def you wont see high definition and you can't blame that on the TV. In regard to sound, I was pleased.  The glare is minimum.  There are a total of five windows in our living room.  I ended up using the pre defined sports option to watch shows and turned off a majority of the options to find a picture that is pleasing.

Andew Currie", "ReviewID": "R3UC65XZ3A4HXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been wanting an HDTV for some time now, but the prices weren't in my budget. Up until this point we had a small tube style TV with built in DVD player we occasionally used, but I wanted something more. I did a lot of research on HDTVs in the 32\" range. I was originally tempted by a TCL slim profile TV, but the price shot up over $100 before I took the plunge. I had looked into a Sceptre TV and a a Vizio too.I decided on Vizio because their TVs seem to have universally good reviews, with good build quality and good picture quality. This particular TV is one of Cnet's top picks for the 32\" class. I chose to spend a little more on this Smart TV because I was interested in the built-in apps and wifi connectivity. We don't have cable so being able to use apps to watch the things we want VS paying more for a bunch of channels I don't want sounded appealing. I got mine on sale here for $289. It took about a week to arrive with Super Saver shipping (I didn't have prime yet), but arrived undamaged.I'm very happy I made this purchase. First of all, the picture quality is terrific. Really sharp, great colors and shadows, no distortion in fast action sequences (I watched the Avengers and Transformers to put it to the test). At may be 720p but at this size you can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p. I can't at least.Build quality is very good to. It seems nice and sturdy and even managed to survive being knocked over by a cat without a scratch (thank goodness, that was day 2 of ownership!). I also like the slim frame, it makes it look more elegant.Sound quality is good I think. Much less tinny than the Sceptre I was looking at. I'll probably buy some dedicated speakers at some point (I was thinking maybe the Sony SSF-5000), but its perfectly adequate.We still don't have cable, but I its not a problem. I got Netflix which has been great. Most of the shows I want to watch are available. I also just got Prime, which works well, but doesn't have as much selection that you don't have to pay rental fees for. For example, Futurama costs $1 per episode with Prime, but happily Netflix has all 9 seasons and all 4 movies. But I digress. It has a nice selection of apps including Youtube and hulu. Wireless streaming with Youtube doesn't work well in HD (takes forever to load), but Netflix and Prime are well optimized for streaming. The video quality is great most of the time and they adjust to keep the video from stopping to buffer most of the time.I ordered the tv with a couple AmazonBasics HDMI cables and Sony BDPS185 blu-ray player. Haven't actually played a blu-ray yet, but boy my DVDs never looked so good. The difference between composite and HDMI connection is profound.I've had the TV for about a month now and couldn't be happier. It fits perfectly in our small apartment and movie night is much more enjoyable, plus catching up on all the shows I've missed is awesome.

We were very excited about it and it really looked great in the corner we set it in. We had no complaints until two days later while we were streaming a movie from Netflix the sound suddenly went up to full volume and the tv started making a loud popping noise. We turned the tv off and started the movie over and all went well. We had no more problems until three days later while watching the evening news, the same thing happened again. We turned the tv off and right back on again and it seemed to be okay. We decided if it happened again we would just change channels and see if that straighened it out without having to turn the tv off. About ten minutes after the State of the Union address came on, it happened again. I used the remote and went up a channel. The loud noise and loud popping sound was still sounding but the screen went blank. I tried to use the remote to change channels. Nothing happened. I tried to turn the tv off with the remote and it would not respond. The remote was totally useless. We had to turn the tv off with the button on the side of the tv. All this happened within eight days after we got the tv. Needless to say, I contacted Amazon and returned the tv. Right now we are just undecided about which tv to try next.

In spite of several reviews detailing problem riddled experiences I took the leap. Of faith... It looked to me like most problems were related to sets manufactured towards the last half of 2012. My set was manufactured in mid January 2013 so felt a sense of confidence.  We will see.Out the box the picture did require some tweaking which was easily enough done using settings kindly posted here by another reviewer. One nice thing about this set is settings are unique to the input used, so your dvd could send different video characteristics than cable or satellite.This is marketed as a smart tv but it is only half smart since it does not have an internet browser. On the other hand using Netflix was easy to launch and streamed flawlessly through my wireless network - no hiccups whatsoever.  Speaking of wireless, that too was very easy to set up if not entirely intuitive but still easily enough done. Signal is very strong since the router is only 12 feet away.  Haven't used the other apps as yet.  I still want to connect the vga but only my desktop has that kind of connection and not practical to use that way.  I guess I'll research a wireless connection.Viewing from extreme angles is pretty darn good.  The resolution can be very sharp and I have to question the DirecTV signal input since my 46in Sony seems sharper on the same channel in some cases. That could be a function of my satellite which has a disengaged stabilizing rod that is causing some minor issues and will be reattached tomorrow. Hopefully that will correct what appears to be inconsistency between the two sets.Sound from the set is not that important to me since I have externalized it so I have no input there.  It sounded ok when I did open it up, though.I did call Vizio support for some question regarding initial setup and they were very helpful.Once again about the resolution, there are some tweaks in the menu settings that you must do to get the full HD experience. Initial viewing gave me some pause which gave way to relief after fixing.Less than a week in I'm pretty happy so far.  Maybe I'll kick to 5 stars after more exercise.  Those darn bad reviews scare me.  I'm considering an extended warranty through Vizio.And thanks to all the other reviewers here that helped me with my purchase.Update 2/17/2013 - still working just fine.  Discovered that pausing netflix for maybe a half hour (dinner) the tv just turns off.  But no worries, after the 20 second boot up we were right back to where we paused (The Grey with Liam Neeson.  Don't waste your time, btw).  The blacks are not as black as my Sony but I can overlook that pretty much, not overly bothered by it.  Still trying to figure out what code works on my old Sony \"learning\" remote, RM-VL600.  Learning in quotes because the only way I find it knows a component is by the code only, as opposed to pointing remotes at each other to learn that way.Update 3/20/2013 - TV is still working just fine. As for the Sony remote mentioned above, there is a learn function I discovered and now it is a one button press to everything on and off - TV, DirecTV receiver and surround receiver. Another nice feature is connecting audio output from tv to surround receiver gets sound from whatever programming used.  In other words, if I am watching Netflix sound is routed to my surround.  Without that sound would come through tv because surround had no audio input.  I have directv audio connected to surround and tape monitor button on surround pressed to get Vizio audio.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blank Screen", "Author": "JASON", "ReviewID": "R1ZAWLSATHT26V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After only two (2) months my new tv screen went blank, with no sound or remote control options.

It's very clear, the colors pop and the contrast is excellent.  Regarding the internet apps, so far we've set up Amazon Instant Video and Netflix using the wireless capability, and those are just as eye popping as HD DirecTV.  Madmen on Netflix is almost as good as blu-ray.  Others have gone into specifics, so there's little need to duplicate, but the bottom line is:  this is a great TV regardless of price.

FYI, the picture settings are always a matter of individual taste, but we chose \"golf\" and then customized the sharpness to 8 and the backlight to 100.

This may be partially due to the fact that we were able to tinker with the picture settings, unlike the store display model which was on the factory default settings.We watched some South Park (not like that's a good way to judge picture quality, but whatever) and some Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  I was unsure about our purchase, however, until we turned off the lights and watched a handful of episodes of Game of Thrones with my sister.  The increased contrast you get with an LED tv was immediately apparent - the white wall shining clearly behind the men of the Night's Watch, clad in black.  The picture was absolutely stunning through the 4 episodes we watched.The SmartTV functionality works exactly as I'd expected, and it's very convenient not to have to power up the Wii every time we want to watch something on Netflix.  I read some reviews which stated that the remote and its keyboard on the back side felt cheaply made, though this was not my experience.  The remote wasn't anything special, but I don't feel like it will break if I drop it or handle it roughly.The only con to this TV is that the sound quality of the built-in speaker is pretty poor.  However, if you're spending ~$1000 on a 60\" tv, you likely have already invested in an external sound solution.  If not, you'll want to spend a couple hundred bucks on a decent stereo sound system.Another thing to note is that I'm writing this review the day after we purchased it, and as this line of TVs from Vizio only came out last October, it's hard for anyone to really comment on their longevity.  For this reason, my wife and I opted for our retailer's 4-year extended warranty plan, but I will update this review in 3 months and again in 6 months or as soon as I encounter any issues with the product.In the end, I couldn't be happier with my purchase and wanted to add my voice to the others who say that this TV is the best 60\" LED tv for the price.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "johnny`s kindle", "ReviewID": "ROJ7WYV4R0WVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picture is clear and love the price and that added plus is the smart tv.

Most importantly, and this is what's really the most amazing fact of all: this home theatre-sized flatscreen is currently priced at less than $1,000.  Considering how much time most Americans spend watching TV nowadays, it would seem like this is as important of a home appliance to buy as say a refrigerator, washer-dryer or other $1,000+ priced home appliances.

I've owned Vizio LCDs in the past and typically was impressed with the picture for the price. So when the 60\" became available, I immediately purchased it. Out of the box, I thought it was OK. The picture quality was decent (not spectacular), the WiFi wouldn't stay connected to my network, and the application menu seemed dated and slow. I ended up returning it, disappointed.Fast forward a few weeks to Black Friday... when this TV became available for $688 at WalMart, Amazon, and other big box stores. For that kind of deal, I thought it was much more appropriately priced - so I purchased it again, at $688. Out of the box, the TV had 2 lines through the screen, again disappointed - I called Vizio and their customer service was actually great. They promptly sent me a replacement unit (brand new, not refurb) within a week.The new replacement they sent has been great, the WiFi connects perfectly and no screen issues. Overall, for the price ($688)... I really can't complain. Don't expect top of the line Samsung picture (D8000, ES8000), but more in the 6000-7000 Samsung model range. I've owned many LED TVs over the years, and I can say that for this is one of the best purchases you can make if you can find the lower price. So why the 3 stars? Be prepared for potential issues; lines through your LCD panel, WiFi not connecting, it seems Vizio may have rushed these out of their factory in time for Christmas without properly completing quality checks.Is it the best TV Vizio has made?

I had some reservations but for the price this thing cannot currently be beat.The Good:- Obviously 60\" is a huge selling point at this price.- Picture quality is as good as I had hoped.  With quality source material this thing looks really sharp.- I was worried about the sound quality (since I currently don't have my home theater setup set up) but it's actually about as good as you can expect from an LCD TV this thin.- This thing really is thin and the bezel is slim as well.  It's also pretty light for the size.- The packaging was well-done and the stand was easy to install.- Wifi works well and I have streamed a ton of content so far with zero buffering issues.The Bad:- It really does take a while for this thing to boot up.  Not a huge deal but it can be slightly annoying.- The apps are totally functional but not exactly state-of-the art in terms of their UI and they can be slightly sluggish.- No 3D support (which isn't a huge factor for me but might deter some).Apps:- Amazon app is great but only 720p.  There is also a frustrating thing where, when navigating, the app remains in the side-bar and it would be nice if you could navigate titles full-screen (like the Vudu app allows you to do).- Hulu works really well and the shows look great (though again they are only 720p).  The interface is nice as well and it's easy to load up your queue on your computer then burn through it on your TV.- Vudu is awesome.  The interface is actually pretty polished and you can browse titles full-screen which is nice.  Vudu HDX mode is 1080p and is noticeably better than Amazon's HD content (I bought the same show and compared them back to back).  The only downside is: HDX generally costs more.  I have a lot of content already in my Amazon library so I am pretty invested in the Amazon ecosystem and will not be making the switch.  However, for rentals, HDX is awesome.  A final note on Vudu: it is owned by Wal-Mart which might be a consideration for some.- YouTube looks pretty shockingly good on the YouTube app.  The YouTube app's interface is also pretty usable and it's generally speaking pretty easy to find the content you're looking for.- The other apps I found to be mostly useless.  I don't need to browse FaceBook, listen to internet radio, or check the weather on my TV (since I have other devices that are better-suited for these tasks).  I know everybody has different needs so these features could be important to you.Basically, if you are on a budget and want a huge screen that looks great with built-in wifi and apps this thing is pretty tough to beat.  If you care about 3D but want to stay within this budget you might want to sacrifice screen size and go with a smaller 3D TV.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Greatest deal ever", "Author": "Marc Fisher", "ReviewID": "RKFOZV2NV9JGZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was allowed to purchase a 50 inch tv but had to stick within a budget.

Not all is rosy however. On two separate occasions,I have turned it on and the sound has been absent. Both times turning it off and back on has solved the problem,and I'm hoping it doesn't become a frequent occurrence. Now on to the biggest problem that I'm having with the unit. Netflix! The TV only connects to Netflix every 10th attempt or so. I've tried every fix recommended on the Internet to no avail. I've even tried connecting via Ethernet cable,but the result was the same. It should be mentioned that the TV has no problem connecting to wifi,I just tried the cable out of desperation. We use Netflix via the Wii in another room without issue,so the problem definitely lies with the TV. Hulu+ also refused to connect the one time that I tried it,but we don't use that service,so I've not experimented farther with that one. All of the other apps seem to work well. I enjoy watching full size HD YouTube videos. All in all I'm happy with the unit for the price paid($299) and would recommend it for regular TV viewing.

The picture and sound were fine, as was the lag.  I was happy with the TV.But then, after a long gaming session, I tried to adjust the volume.  That's when I discovered that there is an intermittent issue, with a high occurrence rate, in which absolutely no TV settings can be adjusted (this includes volume, power, menu access - literally everything).  The picture and sound will still work when this is happening, but the TV will not respond to ANY input from the user, whether it comes from the remote or the physical buttons on the TV.  I'm not talking about gaming here, just to clarify - I'm talking about the TV settings.  You seriously can't even turn the set off unless you physically unplug it.I contacted Amazon's tech support (you get it free for 30 days with this set) and, after an exhaustive call, the representative agreed that there was a hardware issue with the TV.  She told me what my options were at that point, and I decided to get a replacement set after she assured me that the rest of the TVs in stock had been tested and that this wouldn't be a problem with the replacement set.Well, I set up the replacement set today and it does the exact same thing.  To top it all off, both the original set AND the replacement set arrived after my \"guaranteed\" delivery date (which was not Amazon's fault - it was the courier's - but it is still frustrating).I called customer service about the new one and I am getting a refund.  I'm still a bit upset that I was assured that the new TV wouldn't have this problem (by an Amazon representative), but it did.This whole order has turned into a 3-week long ordeal, and I certainly haven't been compensated for the amount of time I've had to invest in it (setting up the TVs, re-packing them, taking them back to the UPS facility, etc.).  I was given a $30 promotional certificate, which was a nice gesture, but I don't think it makes up for the hassle of having to return two faulty TVs.I would recommend that people stay away from this TV.

That solution got fixed, but took some talking. The suggestion was made by Vizio why don't you hardwire it instead? Well, if that was an option I would have done it in the first place, and NO, I will not run cabling thru the house to get to my wi-fi TV. This was about par for the course for the rest of my conversations. They come up some nonsense answer, I question them some and low and behold another answer pops up that I should have received in the first place. In the end I got a new firmware downloaded (after 3 phone calls, with 3 different sets of instructions). I still can not get decent Wi-Fi reception, with a decent speed although my laptops and my cell phone have no problem getting enough speed in exactly the same location. If I turn the TV a different way (the way it fits in my cabinet) reception completely disappears, it seems the TV is shielding it from the router. Very disappointing experience.

Using the Disney blu-ray calibration disk helped, but colors are still not as rich as other options.  Clarity of picture is excellent during normal or bright scenes.  Has trouble during dark scenes though.  Side viewing is OK, but quickly washes out the colors even more.Audio through built-in speakers is rather weak.It is a good looking TV with very small bezel and slight matte screen (rare these days).Takes 20 seconds to fully turn on which is annoying until you get used to it.Wifi connected quickly and easily, but seems to be limited to about 6 Mbps when my router is sending out 16 Mbps.  Confusingly, running an ethernet cable (Cat 5e or Cat 6 - I tried them both) limits speeds to about 3 Mbps when they should be higher with a direct connection.  A laptop connected to the same cable shows 16 Mbps download speeds.  Either Vizio is throttling the speeds or their internal speed test is off.  Either way, it does take a few seconds before Netflix will buffer enough to be able to show in HD.One annoying thing is the inability to disable unused inputs in the input selection menu.  So if you only have a cable box and DVD player connected, you still have to cycle through 7-8 inputs to switch between the 2 and you can't do this very quickly as it tends to pause at each input.  Not a big deal, but something Vizio could have easily fixed.Rhapsody doesn't work well - from what I hear from Rhapsody this is a problem between Vizio and Rhapsody.  Pandora works just fine, and while it's not included out of the box, it's easily added (for free) from the Vizio app store.For the price I paid, it's a pretty good TV, but if you're looking for rich colors and good black level performance, there are probably better options out there for a couple hundred bucks more.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "LTC", "ReviewID": "R3TBOOF988E8EL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to be used as a computer monitor.

In fact I ordered a 70 Sharp from Amazon for 2300 but the seller refused to ship over 500 miles from his place so that deal was backed out, thank god.

This is the case even though one has to authorize VIA with Amazon the same way other streaming devices such as Roku get authorized. However, the only thing one can easily do is watch content recommended by Amazon. For anything else, you have to search for the content, which is very cumbersome. Even after you find shows you can't save them in any way.

This was my first and last Vizio purchase and I cannot recommend that anyone should buy any Vizio internet enabled TV product. Also, this experience has made me question whether I will continue with Amazon Prime.

They have a very responsive customer service system in place, that you can contact by phone or email, although it's only available during normal business hours (which is frustrating, as I usually don't watch my TV/have problems with it, during normal business hours).My experience with this TV has been very mixed. We bought it for its \"smart\" features, so that we could stream Netflix and Amazon, wirelessly, but this feature only works about 50% of the time. When it is having a good day, it's beautiful, streaming video effortlessly, with a gorgeous picture and sound. When it's having a bad day, I spend the whole evening digging through trouble-shooting info online, emailing the Vizio customer service people, since they have usually gone home for the day, checking my wi-fi signal, restarting my cable modem and router, and resetting the TV to default (which is usually what the customer service folks tell me to do, anyway).The last point has become the most frustrating aspect of owning this thing. Sometimes, resetting the TV to default actually works, so the hopeful, optimistic side of me gives it a try. This means that you have to re-enter all of the required data, not only for the TV itself, but for all of your streaming accounts (email, passwords, check-here-if-you-agree, etc.). You would think this would not be too much of a hassle, but consider that you have to do this using the arrow & enter keys on the remote, often scouring a non-QWERTY keyboard for the right letter. If any of your passwords are long and have both numbers and upper/lower-case letters, this can be a bit hard on one's positive state of mind.Another thing you should be aware of is the sensitivity of the wireless feature, itself. We bought a new Cisco E2500 wireless router, anticipating the purchase of this TV, which beams a full signal throughout our 1920's era house (with its plaster and expanded steel lath walls), and out into our backyard. We also recently bumped up our internet subscription to the highest speed (thinking maybe the 20mbps we were getting wasn't enough for our poor Vizio). Often, what happens is that the signal doesn't show up on the TV at all, or shows a signal that is at about 2-3 bars - much weaker than what our laptops, iPhone, and kindle show (all of them showing full signal strength). Last night, after trying to get it to work for an hour, we gave up and watched Netflix on my laptop...BOO.So, ultimately, I have given up on this TV being \"smart.\" For the money, it's a good quality TV for the picture and sound, but the wireless features are so sketchy, they are practically non-existent. At this point, we will probably buy a Roku or some other external device for streaming wirelessly.  A \"smart\" TV is a great concept, but this is our second one in this price range, and both have offered a similarly disappointing experience (we exchanged the first for this current one - god bless costco). I would say that as there are so many positive reviews on this TV, that we must be the common denominator where our problems are concerned (our old house/the metal lath in our walls), but then I can't account for the strong connectivity with all of out other devices. As far as I'm concerned, it's all about the hardware, and the cheap components in this TV are reflected in the affordable price.There. Now I feel a little better.

So crisp, it's like you are watching a sitcom that is being taped live without all those camera filters.  That's cool, but it's a little unsettling at the same time. However, it shows how amazing the TV is at delivering a great picture.  If anyone says the picture is disappointing, it's because they haven't worked on these advanced settings.Lots of complaints about the stand in review, but I can tell you that it's just fine. I am guessing these people are putting the TV on some flimsy table because my TV table is rock solid and the TV stands fine on its own stand.

I bought a 47\" Vizio LCD HDTV in 2007 and it's -still- running like a champ. Overall, I love Vizio and want to continue supporting them since, in my opinion, they offer the highest quality economy televisions out there; however, I cannot, in good conscience, ever recommend the Vizio E701i 70\" TV to anyone. Over the past 4 months, I've bought and returned 2 of these models at my local Costco. Thankfully, they have a very generous return policy.The reason why I returned both TVs is that after one and a half to two months, I started noticing little white bright spots appearing at the bottom third of the television. They don't look quite like dead pixels. These white spotty areas are generally the size of a handful of pixels. Maybe 5-6 pixels in a circular cluster. They also generally only appear when light images appear on the screen. Like, when you're watching a hockey game or a commercial with a white or light screen. They generally don't show up when the screen has landscapes, dark scenes, etc. It almost looks like someone took a fine tipped stick and poked the TV.What surprised me even more was when I went to Costco today to take back my 2nd 70 inch TV. I was wandering around, searching for a suitable replacement when I saw the same 70 inch TV on display. I waited until a bright screen popped up to see if the floor model TV was plagued with the same issue as mine. Sure enough, an NHL demo popped up, showing some hockey highlights. Boom, there they were, the bright white offenders at the bottom third of the screen.In a way, I was happy to know that I wasn't the only one being affected by this issue. Still, I'm surprised that there aren't more people out there complaining about it. 3 out of 3 TVs that I've seen have been affected by this? not very good numbers!So, to wrap things up here, I would recommend looking elsewhere if you're in the market for a large HDTV. As attractive as the price is on this model, it's just not worth it. Once you see those bright clusters of pixels at the bottom of your TV, you just can't unsee them. After dropping $1600 clams or so on this beast of a TV, the last thing you want is to feel like you didn't get your money's worth.Vizio, I'm giving you one last chance. A Costco employee seems to think your M series is better than your E series, which the E701i-A3 is. I didn't really want the 3D capabilities that come with the M class, but the price on the M series is still right (I settled for a 65\" M651d-A2R).Do yourself a favor, if you buy this TV, get it from a local Costco, or get some kind of extended warranty that will allow you to exchange the TV within 90 (if not more) days. 2 months was the magic number for me when these little bright spots started appearing.

Football looks great, no ghosting.  Blu-rays look stunning.Your settings do not carry over to the next Input.  This can be good or bad, but I use the same settings across all Inputs.As for the apps, I now regularly use Amazon Prime's instant videos.  HD streaming is just as good as Blu-ray.  YouTube works well.  Those are the only two I've used so far, look forward to more.  Needs a browser app.The remote takes some getting used to.  Full QWERTY keyboard on the back is just the right size, even for large fingers.  Didn't have high hopes there...it's intended to be a remote, not a keyboard.  Backlighting would help, as using the keyboard in darkness is nearly impossible.  The control side of the remote isn't so bad, main buttons are easy to memorize.  Video control functions on the remote work with the apps so you can pause, fast forward, rewind (etc...) using buttons.Speakers are great, but don't expect them to be the latest and greatest; you can't expect a whole lot with the small bezel and slim-size.The only quirk I have is that it takes about 10-12 seconds to turn on after pressing the power button.Bottom line: this TV is second to none for the price.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Value in TVs Today", "Author": "Jerry Palmerino Jr", "ReviewID": "R3LX9WTRBCYZKA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Vizio.  I replaced a Samsung DLP and Onkyo a/v receiver with this tv. I must say, this is the best value for my money and everything I hoped for (with the exception of a few minor issues).The combination of my Samsung and Onkyo setup was using 800 watts of electricity to run at all times, so this tv was a cost effective replacement at only 62 watts.  Plus, my onkyo receiver was flaking out, losing the HDMI signals multiple times during a show, buzzing through the speakers, and causing \"sparklies\", so it was time to junk it.Pros:The picture is awesome.  My Samsung was a 720p DLP.  This is a 1080p LED.  My wife immediately noticed the difference when I was playing 1080p content.  She mentioned several times to me how beautiful the picture is.  I sensed she was skeptical when I bought it because I don't think she has ever heard of Vizio before.  I had though, so it wasn't a concern for me.The sound is pretty good. I noticed when I watched Jurassic Park on this tv though that it lacks bass (during the title sequence with the loud booms).  When I had my Samsung, I had the video and audio running through an Onkyo receiver.  The sound coming through the 7.1 speakers clearly blew away anything out of the tiny speakers in this tv (which I presume are larger than some thinner tvs).Because this tv had 4 HDMIs (4!), I could hook up all of my devices without needing an a/v receiver.  I sure do miss the bass though, but I'm in a town-home.  My neighbors probably have no complaints now.Built-it Netflix and Amazon (to name just two) saves me from having to run my 2nd generation \"fat\" PS3 (another 300 watts).In about a month of using this tv, I have saved 200 kilowatt hours and some money too on my electricity.Cons:The remote is terrible.  It is nice to have built-in buttons for Netflix and Amazon, but this remote requires you to press hard to get a response.  Sometimes, you don't even know if the press registered. I replaced it with a programmable Logitech Harmony. This tv also requires you to point your remote directly at the sensor on the lower left corner of the bezel, or nothing happens.The Internet apps, including Netflix are slow to load and buggy.  I have had to unplug the tv once already (in about a month's total usage) because it froze while watching Netflix and I could not get the tv to respond.  The Netflix app also has an aspect ratio issue, meaning that, if a movie has letter boxing, sometimes the letter boxing gets smaller and larger multiple times during a movie. This results in an effect where it looks like the movie jumps (as it then occupies more screen area and then suddenly less when it jumps back).  The changes are uniform, in that if the screen size changes 1/4 inch at the top and bottom, it then changes back by the same amount (of course I'm eyeballing this measurement).  This does not happen when I watch the same movie on Netflix using my PS3.Why is there no Picture-in-Picture?Overall, I am happy enough with this tv for the amount I spent for it.  It would have been twice as much or more for a similar model from the bigger tv manufacturers.  I can live with and work around its flaws.  Maybe a software update will fix the issues I mentioned.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible functionality for the price", "Author": "O", "ReviewID": "R8J15HDUQUDS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use the 32inch version for watching Netflix while running on the treadmill.

Mounting was made easier due to its very lightweight.Picture quality for casual viewing is very good.  Blacks and colors are all where they should be.  Most important is that there are no annoying artifacts to distract viewing.My only beef with the TV is that the sound is not great.  Although I expect it is not worse than other TV's in its class.

I tried everything in picture settings to change this, but I never achieved the type of picture I was used to with my Samsung plasma.  The picture looked washed out, colors were weak, and black levels were pitiful.  I ended up returning this tv and buying a Panasonic 65\" plasma.

This HDTV is the real deal, and well worth the price.  My husband and I purchased and moved into our new home in late December of '12, and due to the fact that we hadn't bought a new family room sized TV in more than 17 years, I knew we were way overdue. I thought a nice, new flat screen would be the perfect surprise addition to our new digs, to coincide with our wedding anniversary and would also a very nice housewarming gift to ourselves. I'd been checking out the flat screens in different establishments for quite some time and loving them, I knew we just had to have one. Of all the different types,  models and sizes, Vizio was by far my favorite. I began to research the tech mags regarding the various types - plasma vs.  LED-LCD, along with the preferred settings and ratings for each, this was the perfect model for us. The clarity is astounding, and having chosen the LED due to location and glare issues, it has been no let down.  I'd been unaware they came in 70\" sizes, and upon learning they did (the perfect size for the location I wanted it mounted), that was THE deciding factor for me. However, The DEAL SEALER was sweetened even more, when I accidentally happened upon a \"Black Friday\" special price in March, so I couldn't take a pass on that good of a price.

I was getting tired of not being able to see the image in a bright room since we have lots of windows in our living room. LED TVs are typically much brighter, and this one certainly is. I saw this model at Sams and it appeared to be pretty good, but you really can't tell how well they perform in those settings because of the ambient light, and the video signal that the TVs get.So I decided to order this TV based on the reviews here on Amazon. They're pretty good. I received it yesterday, set it up and did all of the tweaking I could to get the best possible picture. I'm just not impressed. As you move even slightly off centered, the image begins to wash out (brightly). Move too much and it looks really bad.Colors are rarely accurate.

It has very little processing power for the host of apps it intendeds to make use of.  Long delays after button presses to access features, steaming apps will fail to to buffer and stutter or stop, and the TV will crash.The first one I purchased died in the first sixty days.

I instead opted to take the TV back to Sams Club and get a new one there.The new set has all the same issues of the old one, just has yet to die.  I called Vizio again asking about how to stop the steaming apps from crashing and stuttering and they put me through the old \"Powercycle it!  No no, Clear the settings!  Set it factory!

It works great with this set, and I was able to order a new one online for about $16.50 including free shipping.  Vizio should have included this one with the set.  grrrrRegarding the \"smart\" stuff (Vizio Internet Apps): I haven't played with other smart TV implementations, but the apps on this set seem slow to load and clunky.  For a set at this price point, I wasn't expecting much, so am not disappointed.

The Netflix app on the AppleTV (or Roku) is a better implementation than what comes bundled with the TV or our Sony BluRay player. And with the iPad setup, we get what is really useful:  a web browser!!!!  Note that most iPad apps will not utilize the full screen of any TV (think 4:3 aspect ratio picture on 16:9 TV set) -- the app needs to be written to support \"full screen mode\".  The built-in Safari web browser on the iPad only shows up in non-full screen format, but we found a really good alternative called \"Perfect Web Browser\" that does, and one of the really cool things about it is that while you are watching a youtube video through the TV (in full screen glory) from one \"tab\" of the browser on the iPad, you can flip to another browser \"tab\" on the iPad (visible just the on iPad screen) to do other surfing.Back on the TV, we showed off the TV to a home theater enthusiast friend, and he was satisfied with what he saw, but commented on how the colors seemed a little muted or washed out.

With the thin Bezel it gives a nice clean look and using a low profile mount it looks fantastic on the wall.Now it is easy to expound on all the virtues of the tv which there are many but I will give you SMALL issues I did have with it because that is really what you are looking for right?1) the Standard picture setting you get out of the Box have to be tweaked as they are way too \"colorful\"....use the settings giving in here from Kris above as they are an excellent starting point and then tweak a little here and there to your liking. The problem I had is that you had to redo them for all the different inputs.....it isnt a one time fix. Once you have done them for the inputs though they stay2) the hook ups and power connector are set a little far in IMO and make it difficult (slightly) to hook things in when you are mounting on a wall. If you are going for a clean install you want to hide the cluster of wires behind the tv so they will already be sitting there and you have hook them up last. A minor issue3) my Biggest issue with the whole thing really is the remote.......it is a great remote to be sure as I mentioned above but I think it was short sighted of Vizio to not make this a Universal remote. I was going to buy a Vizio Bluray player also but found out that even though both of the remotes are basically identical one will not control both pieces of equipment. Something for them to think about......It would make the experience better if they made the TV remote a Universal and also promote brand loyalty4) the access to Netflix and Amazon prime is excellent and the experience with Netflix is what you have come to expect but if you really look into it, the content in Prime streaming is actually surpassing Netflix now. Example (for us 40-50 year olds) you can now stream Friends and the West Wing on Prime and you can not do that on Netflix.....so the issue is that the interface with Netflix is excellent for saving what you are watching and your instant Que......Prime really needs to make the interface better. you have to jumps through a few too many hoops to get back to where you were. Again a smallish thingAll in all a wonderful purchase and if you are in the market for a TV this size you simply can not go wrong with this TVand this is for you out there that think that a 60 Inch TV is too big for a bedroom.........its because you havent tried it.

A WINNER OUT OF THE BOX!!!", "Author": "HappyUser", "ReviewID": "R2Y427A5EB16F9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Needed to replace a 33\" SONY Bravia HDTV for a 20' x 25' room, to fit in a 35\" shelf space. After reading a boatload of these reviews and other leading consumer electronics rating websites, I chose to evaluate the Vizio E320i-A0 IN PERSON. Had enough of other people's subjective \"visual\" opinions, so I visited the two largest electronics U.S. retailers to see for myself. These two mega-stores had incredible working displays of just about EVERY brand of 32\" to 60+\" hdtv's ... and side-by-side.Walked out with the E320i-A0!!! for $249 (price rose to $288 everywhere 5 days later). A bargain for this smart TV!! It had THE BEST picture!! This TV has a max resolution of 720p, but there is NO need to spend an additional $100-or-so for a 1080i or 1080p because according to every website expert (CNet, etc.), the difference between 720p and 1080p cannot be detected by the human eye in a TV that is under 45 inches wide.Got it home, set it up on the included stand, plugged in the power cord, plugged in the HDMI cable from the DirecTV DVR box to the TV, and finally, an HDMI cable from a Dolby 5.1 surround-sound receiver to the second of two HDMI inputs on the TV (it is optical cable and S-Video cable capable too).Set-up was a BREEEEEZE and took literally just minutes!! The onscreen menus are simple and easy to understand for a non-techie like me! The remote acts as a keyboard for choosing options. That being said, the only adjustment necessary was that I liked a little brighter picture, otherwise everything was perfect .. from the nice rich black to the vivid colors!During set-up, the TV picked up my home wireless signal immediately, asked me to give it a name, and to enter the network's wireless password. Netflix worked flawlessly with full surround sound! ... as did my other subscriptions.The remote has dedicated buttons to launch Netflix, Amazon On Demand, and MGo Movies ... but you can add ANY subscription you want to the on-screen menu (called a \"VIA Dock\"), for instant access (like Hulu, etc.), and put it in any order you wish! Totally convenient when one button away!The only criticisms I have is: 1) The black plastic frame around the screen is shiny (not matte), and it reflects lamps and other light sources. Not a problem, but still - it would be better if it was matte. 2) Can't sit too far to the side, but this is for watching TV in bed anyway. 3) The remote could be a tad larger.If you are looking for a small, smart, led tv with an incredible picture, RUN ...

I used the THX app in iOS for the basic settings and then starting from the cnet recommendations, I used some judgement by eye to get the rest. I am quite satisfied with the settings at present. This TV set has outstanding picture quality and the only downside is the off-axis viewing is a little bit narrow relative to my superb 60\" LG Plasma. I got mine from Costco (wish the Walmart deal was available here, but even with $500 bucks more, it seems worth it). I don't use the smart features or the sound. I have a pioneer receiver with the marvell qdeo chip for upscaling and an internet connected google tv device for my \"smart\" content like netlifx, youtube and amazon.The interesting thing about this TV is that the quality of the picture is wholly reliant on the source material. The better the source, the better the picture quality.

Before buying this, I did alot of research on similar 47\" LED TV`s. The consensus was that for TV`s this size and price range the Vizio E Series was a safe bet and I couldn`t agree more. The picture is absolutely beautiful. The Smart TV apps are responsive. The set-up was very easy. Others have mentioned issues with the remote in their reviews, but I find that as long as the remote is pointed at the TV it works as it should.I`ve also read other reviews of how people have adjusted their picture settings according to CNET`s preferences. I value CNET`s opinion, so I tried their recommended settings with this TV.  In my case, where the TV is located, this does not benefit from their suggestions. I have this TV in a living room, perpendicular to a large bay window which faces south. During the day there is alot of sunlight in this room and CNET`s picture settings were too dark. In my opinion, the optimal picture is acheived with Vizio`s \"Retail\" setting in a room with alot of sunlight. There is almost no noticeable glare to speak of. There really is no general \"ideal\" picture setting. Every application has it`s differences, and it`s nice that this TV has the ability to be adjusted based on what yours are.The other thing I`d like to mention was my hesitation of ordering a TV like this online. I have always bought my electronics in an actual store as opposed to the internet for fear of damage incurred with shipping. This is the first time I`ve ordered something like this online and I`d like to point out that Amazon does a very nice job with the packaging. The TV arrived with not so much as a scratch on the box.

Out of the box I found the picture be a bit to saturated, even on the normal setting. After a few minutes of adjustments and turning off some of the features I had the set looking the way I wanted it. I'm dinging it a star due to two very small annoyances that Vizio could easily and inexpensively fix:1) The included power cord is only 4 feet long. That's way too short given how many people prefer to wall mount their displays or if your electrical outlet isn't located where you want your set to go. An 8 foot cord wouldn't be that much more expensive to include and it's always better to have a cord that is 2 feet two long than 2 inches too short!2) If you want to wall mount the set you'll need 4 M6x18 bolts as Vizio didn't bother to include them. Vizio also doesn't bother to say what size bolts you need in the included quick start guide. Again, it would cost maybe $.20-.30 to include 4 M6x18 bolts.Both of these problems could easily be fixed by Vizio and it would save customers from having to make an extra run to the hardware store.

Based on her budget and wants, I found the Vizio E241-A1 24-inch Razor LED HDTV.  After a little more research I decided to add a few extra bucks in myself and get her the Vizio E-Series E241i-A1 24-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED Smart HDTV.Both are 24 inch LED HDTVs with 1080p and 60Hz.  The best that I can tell, the only difference is the ability of the E24li-A1 to connect to the internet to provide additional functionality and viewing options.Once I connected the Vizio LED smart HDTV to her Wi-Fi, I was able to set up her profile, update weather cities, and connect to Hulu.  Everything seems to work fine until I selected a show to watch in Hulu.  Grandmother's DSL based Wi-Fi speed is good enough for her limited use, but isn't fast enough to stream without buffering.  This TV doesn't buffer at all, so watching the show was stop and go to a point of being unwatchable.  I didn't expect buffering capabilities, although it would have been nice to know ahead of time this would be an issue.  Fortunately, watching Hulu isn't a feature grandmother is likely to use.I was able to teach grandmother how to check the weather and look at yahoo news articles.  She isn't internet or technically savvy, so it's clearly a simple to use and understand menuing system which allowed her to pick it up so quickly.  Plus she is happy with the picture quality and sound.  Even watching a little football, I couldn't see any ghosting or artifacts from fast action.If you're looking for an inexpensive internet ready HDTV, the Vizio E-Series E241i-A1 24-Inch LED Smart HDTV is worth considering.  Wi-Fi speed may be an issue for those looking to watch Amazon Prime Videos or Hulu Plus.  Even if Wi-Fi speed is an option today, I would still suggest spending the minor difference for the extra features.PROS:Good picture qualityNo ghosting while watching sportsSimple to use menu systemCONS:No buffering capabilities", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picture perfect", "Author": "Smooth", "ReviewID": "R366W4ZLI9ENVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nothing else needs to be said about this tv...great quality, picture and sound it's an awesome buy.

I've been using it for two weeks.I've owned Vizio products before and I haven't had a single problem with them.There are a lot of the connectors are on the left side of the TV.  This was a little bit of a problem for me because all of the things I want to connect to it are on the right side of the TV.  I just needed to use longer cables, not much of an issue.I connected a coaxial antennae to the TV, scanned the channels and was watching OTA HD in minutes.I connected to the internet through WIFI setup was painless and easy!  Ethernet cable connection is plug and play.The SMART TV functionality is nice. A lot of the same features (Amazon instant video, netflix, etc) can also be done with my XBOX360, but I'd rather only have one device on (instead of two).  This TV is very low power so it doesn't heat up my room as much as my old LCD tv + XBOX360.Now onto the TVs display.Out of the box, the TV didn't need any tuning at first glance.  I was watching a college football game (Georgia bull dogs vs Clemson Tigers)  You could tell the difference easily between the Deep red of Georgia and the deep orange of Clemson.  I was in a sports bar watching a replay of the game and you couldn't tell the difference.  Big points for out of the box tuning.This TV has some really deep blacks.  It's especially noticeable when the screen goes dark between scene transitions in a movie.

The second one, while better, it will always power off and not lock up, it still has issues when powering up. After you turn it off, if you try to turn it back on too quick, it won't power up. We have to wait several minutes to able to get it to power up. On top of that, sometimes when it powers up, the logo is not display and no picture is displayed for more than a minute. It looks like the the TV is locked up but EVENTUALLY it will come around and finally display video and unfreeze itself. Other times it will display the logo and power up and display video within about 5-10 seconds. The other thing I noticed is the setup menu is completely inaccessible for several minutes after the TV powers on. I press the button or select the smart bar option to open it and nothing happens. Then eventually several minutes later, out of the blue the setup menu will appear. Again, this is my second one, so it has become extremely frustrating.The picture itself is very nice once you get the settings right.

However, they don't have MLB.TV or NHL Gamecenter. The Amazon app leaves a lot to me desired too since it never starts a full screen app, leaving you to navigate thru pages and pages of movies in a 1 quarter screen sized window.

(I have several woot refurb projectors and they have worked out just fine).This TV sold last year for around $2,000 new. It is cheaper now because VIZIO came out with a 240HZ model.I don't usually care about additional features on a TV but I found this model's built-in Wifi and apps, very handy when it came to watching Netflix and Amazon VOD. Just flick a button on the remote. NO need to switch to a separate box.Since it runs at 120Hz video refresh, you will probably want to adjust the settings to avoid having movies look like tv soap operas due to the \"smooth action\" algo - It's a personal taste kind of kind. Some folks love the \"extra clear look\", I prefer my movies to look like movies including filmed TV series.  You won't have to call a professional, you have access to many options right from your remote and if you read the reviews here at Amazon and other places you will see folks list their favorite settings. Initially I left mine as it came, but after a week I played with the settings to tune it to my liking, including removing the smooth action.Angle wise, some reviewers complain about NOT being able to see it from the side, we haven't had that problem. It replaced a Samsung DLP which could be viewed from many different angles and this is the same or probably better. We have it in a room with an L shaped \"pit\" furniture and a huge ottoman in center and it is equally enjoyable anywhere on the room.The picture quality is very bright (can be toned down or turned up at will) and can be very vivid or subdued (again based on your taste). On a dark room, the brightest settings will set your eyelashes on fire. It has very good blacks and dark areas on the screen. I know some people complaint that LEDs can't come close to PLASMA TVs but this one is close enough for anyone less than a purist.The built-in sound is good considering there is NOTHING to this TV. Meaning it has a thin (one inch or less) \"frame\" around the screen like a picture frame, so the speakers face backwards (mounted behind). This actually makes the sound bounce back at you from the wall behind it which surprisingly works out fine. I prefer deeper/louder sound so I have it hooked up to a receiver, but I sometimes I don't turn on the receiver and the kids often use it without the amp.  It depends on taste. Via the amp the surround sound is as rich as any other quality audio source. Without it is fairly loud.If you are mounting it on a wall, make sure to get the right mount. And if you are not, make sure you push in the included base tightly against the TV and tighten the four screws \"in sequence\" (like replacing a tire). The TV is huge and the stand is tiny, so you want a nice tight fit. I'm using it on a glass stand I had and I found it best to open the box upside down, and apply the base while the TV was upright (vertical) upside down looking down on it. Gravity helped sit the base in nicely.In terms of size, if you have a 60 or 65 inch Samsung type DLP TV, the 70 will fit in nearly the same space because as I said earlier it is just the screen and a thin frame around it- no extra plastic.I'm picky about large TVs, taking me a while to find one that I would like at a price I feel is fair and this TV is very nice all around. I would definitely buy it again. You can not get a better 70in TV unless you pay an additional $800-$1,000 and considering how quickly the technology changes, it wasn't worth it to me. But even if you do pay more, I'm not sure many people could tell the difference.We have an 11 foot screen \"movie room\" in the basement but this TV gets a lot of attention right in the living room.

The back has a keyboard, but you have to hold it pointed towards the TV because it's RF.NEUTRAL:  - Stand.  Apparently it doesn't swivel and because the TV is so big it is a bit wobbly.

While necessary for a professional photographer who works with print media, it is not necessary with TV viewing for many reasons.

If a few want to attempt perfect color calibration, knock yourself out.Anyone who tells you to set it this way or that way is presumptuous at best. Set it the way YOU like it.For the price paid, this 70\" rocks! Granted, you do need to adjust some color parameters to suit your individual preferences.I found the \"Standard\" setting pretty close to what I like. I suggest experimenting; just remember to either write down your setting prior to adjusting or simply do a \"reset\" if you get lost.The \"flimsy\" base stand question is w/o merit, unless your kids want to climb on it.

For the 1st 68 days it has been superb.  It has left nothing desired as far as an HDTV could provide.  I have found both the video and audio good.  I have not tweeked the video settings as it came to me.  I found no need to seek improvement.  I have the choice of running the sound thru a BOSE home entertainment system, but actually prefer the TV's voice sound.  I especially like the remote.  One of its best features is the WIDE button in the lower left hand corner.  With current TV formats being delivered in different sizes, it is nice to be able to select the picture expansion choices, there are 4 choices, quickly and easily.  One of the main factors in my selecting VIZIO over other brands, is that their customer technical support is in UTAH, USA.  Without prejudice, I felt that if the time should come that I might need to talk to them, I would be able to understand them.  Well the time came, and it was a great experience.  I had forgotten how good customer service could be.  The video went out today.  I spoke to Liz at their support center.  In a 10 minute call, max, she had me unplug the TV, hold the ON button in for 30 seconds, plug it back in, turn it ON and see that the screen was still a deep blue.  From that she determined that they would send me a new TV, via freight, set the new TV up, repack the old defective one and take it away at no charge.  I do not know how I could ask for more.  I also asked her, from her experience, how often does she see this problem.  Her answer is that approx. 1 in 100 experience a bad video card.

I waited after Christmas because I missed the sales and didn't want to have to pay full price for it.Just a few days ago it dropped in price and I was ready to buy.First off, i have read most of all the customer reviews from both Vizio and Amazon and was prepared that something might not be perfect when it arrived. I have a 32 Vizio that I got 4 years ago and was completely amazed at how it performed. So I mostly went with this set because of past experience (and for the price and 70\"). So When it arrived I had that nervous feeling in my stomach till I could get home to set it up.The Delivery Company was probably the best experience I've ever had. They were professional, and actually carried it up a flight of stairs. That doesn't usually happen here in Chicago. Usually you have to pay the guy 20 dollars to even consider doing anything besides just opening the back door of the truck. And most of the time they are not very nice.So anyway, got it all set up and the picture was amazing. I had to tweak the settings but played some bluray and DVDs and tested the cable and overall i was completely happy with the quality. I read about problems with the off-axis issues some people were having but I really did not see anything that was what I had read about. It does fade a little but really unless you are picky about that kind of thing I have no worries about any of my guests for the super bowl coming up having a bad experience.But here comes the minor exception... while I had read some talk about black level quality and uniformity issues there was a problem with my set having some strange fading, blacklit problems.. Not sure if thats what you call it. But basically when there was a black spot between scenes in a movie, or on a unused input there was a noticeable gray splotches. No matter what you did, turning down brightness, contrast, etc it didn't go away. It was very distracting watching a movie that had black bars. I could tell that it was a problem with the screen and not normal.So having a replacement sent.. and thanks to Amazon for having the best customer service. I look forward to getting the new set and will update. Because besides what I think is a bad apple out of a bunch.. the new one should hopefully fix this issue.UPDATE 6/8: Okay so after the replacement the cloudy screen was much much better. There was still a little bit of the flashlight effect in the lower corner. but overall i hardly ever noticed it. Skip to a few months later and then in the bottom 1/3 the tv developed bright spots... like some of the pixels wouldn't turn off... you could see it when the screen was on something light or brigh white but dark screen you couldn't see it.So i called Amazon who sent me to Vizio for help. Vizio, i have to say, reps are very nice and helpful. we went through a few steps to check if it was just something that could be fixed.. like resetting to factory settings.. unpluging the power cord and let it sit for a sec.. the normal tech support things. Then they asked for me to send pic cause it did sound like a defect in the screen.I did and they sent a replacement right away. This one came from Vizio directly so after the issues I've had with the last two sets and what i've read from others troubles I figured this should get me a set that is perfect. It arrived, set it up, and I am happy to say.. this set is without a flaw that I can see in the picture quality or the screen itself... i was happy to not see any flashlighting or cloudy blacks... I don't know if they had problems with the first few manufactured sets but maybe they finally got it worked out because I could not be happier..Yes it was a pain to have to get it replaced a third time but after all this I am happy it turned out.I really like this television. The picture quality is superb. The audio.. does suck but expected that. Plan on getting a proper home theater setup soon.Overall if you are looking at this television and it's at a price you like.. i would get it.

We were going to go with the 55 inch but the 60 inch came on sale now before the super bowl.  Got the TV home and it shut itself off within 2 minutes.  In the spam of a 30 minute TV program it would shut itself off 3 times.  While watching the playoff games it shut down 15 times.  After two calls to customer service (which were pleasent)  they could not solve the problem and we took the TV back.  The second one has been fine so far. No problems and the kids and adults love it.What to like:1) Picture quality is quite good.As other reviews state you do have to play with the settings to get a good picture that is specific for your room.  I read several review stating to use the \"vivid\" mode.  This ended up being way too bright and made the colors run.  We are happy with the standard setting.  Honestly unless you have two TV's side by side it is hard to say that this is better or worse than brand name Samsung or Sony.  Watching sports or HD programming is very clear.  Just make sure to turn off the \"soap opera effect\".2)  Remote.Having the qwerty keyboard makes typing everything in for internet use and for setup very easy and quick.  Since we have young kids and watch most tv at night having the keys backlit would have been nice but not a deal breaker.3)  PriceHow can you go wrong for the price for a 60 inch smart TvNot so good:1) Time to turn onIt take about 15 seconds for the tv to turn on.  Not a huge problem just something some people may not like.2) Stand.We bought the tv with plans to mount it so it doesn't affect us but for those who are going to just use the stand make other plans to stabilize it.  This is a big Tv and it is very wobbly on the stand and could be easily knocked over by kids or pets  .Summary:  All in all the TV works great.  The picture is good and functions are easy to navigate.  Outside of a couple minor annoyances you can't go wrong.***first update** 11/12/13Up until now the TV has been fine but on Sunday the kids were watching morning cartoons the TV screen went black never to return.  The power light will come on and after 10 seconds it dims but no picture or light comes onto the screen.  After reading other reviews about a faulty video chip we were left with two options.  Either wait around for Vizio to send out a repairman or just return it back to Sams.  We opted for the return route.

Two days ago the picture went out. Still had sound, but no picture- even though the screen was still back-lit to some degree (kind of a blue glow). Called Vizio customer service and they walked me through a reset which did not solve the problem. They offered to send someone out to repair it. I said thanks but no thanks. Considering it is only a month and a half old I would return it to Walmart. Walmart, after a little persuasion, agreed to an exchange. We took the first set back yesterday and exchanged it. I set up the new set this morning and, right out of the box, it has colored vertical lines running through the right 1/3 of the screen. Needless to say, I am very upset. I am returning this and getting my money back. I have a 32 inch Vizio that we have had for over ten years without a single issue. I don't know if Vizio tried to rush this product out in time for Christmas or what the problem is, but their quality control department needs to do a better job as this experience has insured I will never buy another Vizio product again!Update - We called Vizio customer service again to report this second failure and they were thouroughly unhelpful and almost rude! Basically just \"Sorry, you have that kind of thing with electronics sometimes, deal with it.\" I'm paraphrasing, but that is the gist of it. This reinforces my earlier statement I will NEVER buy another Vizio product!!01/20/2013 - I have replaced this unit with a 60\" Sony Bravia from Hhgregg and I absolutely love it! Required NO modifications to the picture, it was perfectly calibrated right out of the box. The TV speakers aren't great, but when are they? That's what I have external audio for. This was actually an open box, so I got it for $1,169. Almost twice what I initially paid for the Vizio(but $700 off suggested retail for the Sony and around $300 less than regular price), but after the problems I had with the Vizio and the stellar performance of this set, it is well worth it.

My Samsung is professionally calibrated by Geek Squad. Even than this Visio is excellent. One thing the stand is weak specially if you have children in the house.

Today I downgraded by rating to 2 stars/5.Keep tuned!==================================================================================================Got the Vizio from Costco this weekend of Dec 2012. Brought home, and replaced my 52\" 4 year old Samsung TV. Didn't buy another Samsung because of the service and LCD panel problems, but that's an entire different story. For the short term, no more Samsung TV please.The Vizio picture quality is stunning, both in terms of contrast clarity and vibrance. Watched ESPN football on this, and wow - amazing colors. Used its scanner feature to scan off air channels from HDTV antenna.Then tested the apps, Netflix worked beautifully, amazingly sharp pictures. The kids love watching Netflix on this TV. My son as I am sure will play PS3 COD ... and will love it.The audio is pretty good too, considering it comes from this 1\" thick TV... not much room to squeeze in decent speakers. Hooked up optical audio to my audio booster, and wow- got home theater 6 channels :-)What I liked about the TV:1. Picture quality with sharpness, clarity and vibrance.2. The best 60\" you can get under $10003. Smart features including Netflix, Youtube, etc4. USB ports that allow me to watch photos, videos, and listen to music off my USB thumb drive.5. Wifi and internet hook up.6. Low power, only estimated $17 per year electricity usage.What I hope Vizio will improve:1. The base/stand should swivel some angle so we don't need to move the base with the TV. The screws are kinda flimsy and weak.2. The mechanical design overall could be better, smoother, and more sexy.

Easy as pie return. this thing is huge. It will fit on a smaller stand as long as you think it will hold the weight. over time your stand may sag so in my case i reinforced my press wood  china thing i already had. if you get this tv and it's in the open or you have kids you would be better off getting a 60 inch stan so people will be forced to walk around the stand thus keeping someone from hitting the edge and possibly knocking it off.i noticed some people say the apps are slow to load. in a way i guess they are. BUT, are they comparing it to their phone? i personally do not have a cell phone at all so maybe,maybe not. the apps are not quick and scroll at the bottom of the screen and load times for those i would say are 30-40 seconds. when you decide the one you want to use there is a load time to consider. in this case i would say another 20-25 seconds. it does \"seem\" like a lot of time but for me i'm ok with it.my living room is 19 feet by 13 feet wide. the sound out of this thing as great for me and it's not even half-way up. i got a blu-ray surround sound home theater system on the way and now i wonder if i really needed it. also this tv has the hdmi (arc) feature on it. an audio return component i think it's called and if you want to use that feature MAKE SURE YOUR HOME THEATER SYSTEM HAS THAT FEATURE ALSO.packaging is easy to remove and all there is is a stand and 3 screws to put in....your done. mine is hard wired to my router for internet so i don't have problems that other people have in their reviews. remember that if your SHAREING this tv with other laptops/printers/computers/tablets in your home load times for your apps and down loading movies will suffer if more then one is use at the time. also if you are wi-fi house hold there are transmitting and recieving issues along with what was stated above. the world we live in has many thing communicating all around us. i bought a 50 foot cat6 cable and it runs under the floor in my basement.i have no cable or sattelite at the time so all i have is an antenna on my house with a pre-amp ($100). the tv will scan for channels and i got 25 plus one really bad analog signal...i didn't think it was used anymore. the menu was for me very easy to navigate and understand. the remote is a normal remote on one side and if you flip it over there is a key board style lay out of buttons on that side. sweet !The picture is very crisp with 4 sizes to choose from so if your channel is say 720 instead od 1080p you can just hit a button and widen it or zoom to get the pic the way you want it. there are about 10 different preset picture settings: vivid/football/baseball/basketball/movie/.....etc, etc or you can make your own up (custom). if i remember correctly there are 3 differenet sound settings to choos from.last night i tried out the Amazon app because i all ready  had a movie in my list i watched on my computer months ago. you need to have your computer on when you first try this app because your tv gives you a code to register your tv at amazon.com. i went to amazon via the computer and registered my tv in about 10 seconds..easy,easy,easy. sat there and watched my movie last night. took maybe 30-40 seconds to load and buffer in. great picture and sound.my sony blu-ray home theater system i ordered also has the internet hook up feature and apps so i i want to i could also use it to stream movies right to my tv. for me i am getting the NETFLIX subscription in the near future.one other note: while changeing channels for me with an antenna there is a slight delay. say 1-2 seconds. maybe because i don't have sattelite/cable hook-up.NEW NOTE ADDED NOVEMBER 30TH 2012: JUST DELEATED SOME OF MY PREINSTALLED APPS AND FOUND MANY MANY MORE AT THE YAHOO STORE ONLINE.

For $100-200 more, you can easily get a much better non-smart TV and a BluRay w/wifi or a Nintendo Wii to play Netflix/Amazon.I know this is only 720p and that it's a low model, but it shouldn't be this difficult to get a decent picture for 250 bucks.  Blacks are often gray, and in dark movie scenes, it's as if someone is shining a flashlight from the top & bottom of the screen.  My family has fiddled with all options (except \"backlight\"--see below), and though we managed to get an OK picture, there's a milky, light-flooded quality that just can't be overcome.  We also tried the calibration suggested by a previous 5-star review, but the picture actually seems worse than what we managed to get!BACKLIGHT OPTIONEven after turning \"backlight control\" from \"off,\" the TV would not allow for adusting the backlight, which is frozen.  Even if I'm missing something here, it shouldn't be so difficult to figure out how to adjust this.  Some may call me tech illiterate (though I'd disagree).  But assuming that's true, if the whole purpose of not permitting us to adjust the backlight is so that the tech-illiterate won't accidentally distort the image, then the default should be such that the image is acceptable to us imbeciles.LOAD TIMEAnother minor flaw is that the load times are quite slow for apps and even for the monitor's boot-up.  Netflix sometimes takes 20 seconds, and it's hard to tell whether the app is actually loading or not.  TV boot-up time varies.  My advice: don't let this be the deciding factor.SOME PROSThe smart app buttons on the TV are convenient, but I attribute this more to the convenience of smart tvs as a whole and less to this particular incarnation.  The sharpness of the image is not bad.  My issues with the picture concern the light, not the sharpness.  Obviously, if you're looking for true HD, you should be looking for 1080 (so this is not a factor in my low rating).OVERALL--PAY MORE FOR SOMETHING BETTERThis TV has caused a lot of headache for a family that wasn't looking for perfection.  I'm giving it 2 stars not because it's unbearable but because I value my time, and it wasn't worth the time dealing with the picture.  It'd be OK in a dorm or if you want cheap smart tv functions for occasional wifi streaming.  If you're a TV expert, maybe you can figure out the calibrations quickly or point out the errors of my actions (which I would welcome!), but most of us aren't wanting a course on television functions.

I bought this for my son for Xmas and I spent a lot of time setting it up and playing with it.I waited until it was less than $400 here on Amazon which is a decent price. Sometimes it's a lot higher than that and the TV is not worth it.Some good things:The picture is good, really sharp. The sound is OK. There are a ton of adjustments so you can spend a lot of time playing with it. There are plenty of inputs and you can actually give each source it's own custom name which is nice. Each source can also have it's own mode settings (example, Game Mode for the Wii U input). Setting up the ethernet connection was simple. I use a wire though, not wireless. The web apps are cool, once you get them to load. Youtube works great once it loads. The TV is ultra light so it's easy to setup or move.Some bad things:The web apps are slow to load and the TV quite often locks up. That's really annoying and you have to turn it off to reboot it. You can't upgrade the firmware manually, I guess it's done automatically. Once the apps load though they seem to work well. Also, mine had a weird effect where the screen would slowly brighten then dim then brighten then dim etc. I thought it was a defect but turning off the Smart Dimming feature solved it. That feature is defaulted to \"ON\" which doesn't make sense since it's annoying.I hope they update the firmware soon to make the apps load faster and quit locking up. I question whether I should have paid the extra for the Smart features and instead just went for a basic Samsung TV? Other than that, time will tell if this thing is reliable.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "39-inch - Excellent TV", "Author": "William Dickerson", "ReviewID": "R24XVPL4JPHXZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought some LG 42\" LED TV about a year ago and returned it due to horrible sound quality and back-light bleed.

Couldn't be more pleased with the picture quality, and the sound quality for an LED TV is outstanding.  No need for a soundbar if you're in a normal sized living room.The smart TV interface is also great.  Before setting up the TV I had assumed we would continue using the XBox for our Netflix/Hulu/etc needs due to the speedy interface and controls.  No way.  Now the XBox only gets fired up for games.  I actually prefer the Vizio interface over the XBox 360's.Setting up the picture took some significant effort, as the picture was very washed out at first, the colors very dull.

For the best picture, I would suggest setting the picture mode to \"game\", has the sharpest and brightest colors without washing out which the \"vivid\" setting seems to do. Also, set the color temperature to \"computer\". FYI, it takes about 20 seconds to connect to your cable box (may be the cable box and nothing to do with the TV) before the picture appears. The Twitter, Amazon and Facebook apps are pretty cool.

I havent in several years actually. So, I needed to be able to watch hulu and netflix with out my PS3 which is in storage in a different state. This tv does that very easily. There is even a netflix button (unnecessary but there none the less). The one issue I have with the TV is that the remote is not very easy to use.

None of the mounting screws are included either,  For these reasons, I would not recommend this set if you plan to wall mount it.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Glenn A", "ReviewID": "RIBZJ7ZP7PR7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched the large screen LED's and found, for the money, Vizio was the best buy.

This TV looks nothing like the pictures shown!", "Author": "Alexander Boudreau", "ReviewID": "R28B6FQ0JW2X0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV a few days after Christmas. I was looking for a slightly bigger TV then the one I had and this one seemed perfect. Due to the pictures on the website I was lead to believe all the HDMI ports were all on the side and that it had a stereo audio out port for a 3.5 mm audio device (headphones or the cord similar to the end of headphones). As I opened the product and began to hook it up I noticed that the side of the TV looked nothing like what was pictured. Only one HDMI port was on the side, the other was on the bottom. Also there was no stereo audio out only an optical and a red and white left and right audio out. The TV you receive when you order this product looks like the pictures shown on the VIZIO E320-B0E 32-Inch model. I was not happy since I have computer speakers and a subwoofer that were now not compatible with this TV because they had a 3.5 mm cord and the TV does not have one as shown on the website. I called Amazon and they kindly shipped me a new one that came in 2 days. I was annoyed again to see that they had sent me the exact same model as the first one I received. Clearly VIZIO updated the model without updating their pictures of the device because if you look on the official website and the instruction manual that is given to you they do not match so beware. Other then that I really like the TV. The size is nice for my room, the picture is great and the Netflix ability is nice. Sound is not great, but I bought a VIZIO sound bar and connected it to the TV through the optical port and it sounds great. If you plan to buy this TV beware that the pictures look nothing like what is shown on the TV. If you want a more accurate picture of it look at the  VIZIO E320-B0E 32-Inch model because those pictures are what the TV you receive will look like!", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent price quality tv", "Author": "marius simion", "ReviewID": "R2VJGXLTVMPT7W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Tv looks good,too bad u can't download new apps, querty on remote helps with searching on Amazon prime,this tv has no web acces", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy", "Author": "Andrew Emanuel", "ReviewID": "R2A7D0YIQRFANI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't have anything bad to say about this tv.
