{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautiful Picture! Surprisingly Thin!", "Author": "electronics guy", "ReviewID": "R1GY4CG1ER51DE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Mine arrived this week and it is beautiful! The monolithic screen design with the Gorilla glass / Opticontrast panel is totally black when the set is off. When it is on, the image is stunning. Pair this with a nice Blu-Ray player and it will knock your socks off. It's bright and clear with great colors and the blackest blacks I've seen on a TV. The MotionFlow 480 makes for extremely smooth motion with no snapshotting that you see in sets with lower frame rates. It's also very light. One person can pick it up with no problem as long as your arms are long enough to reach.It comes with a nice pillar and plate stand but I think I'm going to move mine to the wall. I'm really tempted to put a nice frame around it. Seriously. Another very nice feature is you can turn off the light behind the Sony logo at the bottom center of the screen. It's visible enough for me as is and I personally don't like all the extra lights that so many sets use to light up their logos. So nice and subdued it is. The set also locates where people are in the room. It has a camera (not sure how I feel about that on an internet-connected TV) and captures full-on images of you as you watch it. It uses this for adjusting the internal speakers, the 3D effect if you are off center, and to determine if nobody is watching to turn the set off to conserve energy. I might just put a bit of black tape over it and turn off the energy conservation so it doesn't always think it is alone and shut down.This thing also synthesizes 3D from 2D images. You can watch regular TV or DVD's/Blu-Ray, or any of the streaming functions in 3D if you want. It actually does a pretty good job and for the life of me I couldn't tell you how they pull it off. It's basically magic. For true 3D input it is absolutely amazing. You also have the ability to adjust the apparent depth to the 3D effect.I looked at other 3D sets and the images on the Sony don't pop out into the room like some of the others. (Edit - this is a setting and you can bring images out into the room.) It's almost like you are looking into the 3D scene as opposed to having it come out into the room (on the default settings). I think looking into the 3D scene is a bit more natural though not as startling or stunning as having things look like they are basically in your lap. That has lots of wow factor but seems more gimmicky and less realistic. There are a number of adjustments for the 3D image and it's possible the Sony will push them out into the room too. (It can.)One other thing about the 3D effect - the Sony uses active glasses to produce 3D. Most others do too but one manufacturer does not - LG. Their 3D uses circularly polarized glasses just like the ones at the theater with the RealD 3D. Those are cheaper, lighter, and you can even turn your head sideways and still see the image perfectly. I liked the Sony's features better than the LG which is why I went Sony. One was that the set with the plain polarized glasses is only 120 Hz while the Sony is 480. On the Sony with active glasses, and again most others, if you lay down where your head is 90 degrees from vertical, the images go dark. It's surprisingly tolerant of head tilt, though, and stays bright until you are just about horizontal. This will also be a function of the glasses and I did not use Sony glasses. I used Xpand Universal X103 3D Glasses Compatible with Active 3D TV's, Black.Other points - the unit is very well packed but the shipping box is almost as thin (6\") as the set itself (1.1\"). As far as shock damage if you have this unit shipped, I doubt there will be much of a problem unless the shipper is extremely careless. Something sticking through the box is going to stand a good chance of hitting the screen or the back of the unit though the cardboard box itself has very thick walls. Even the box was is great shape and the TV was perfect.This unit was definitely worth waiting for. Also, if you buy this from Amazon, you get a 2 week price guarantee. (Note - Amazon can change the guarantees at any time. Be sure to know the conditions and details when you buy yours.) The day before mine was to be delivered, Amazon dropped the price. I just notified Amazon and the refunded the difference. Nice. You also get a 30 day shipping-paid return if you decide you don't like the set. I'll only use that if something fails. This set is worth the price.Also, I am always leery of buying LCD screen items if returns are going to be a hassle if there are stuck or dead pixels. None of either on my set. I'm exceptionally happy about that! But had there been, Amazon's return policy is better than the local stores' policies. I've got 30 days for something like that to develop (always possible) to make sure I've got a good set. It's hard to beat that.At least in my case, Amazon shipped using CEVA. I had not heard of them before and was a bit nervous watching the CEVA tracking page. I don't know what they are doing there, but it doesn't seem to have any basis in reality. It showed the TV going around the country in a big circle basically and finally arrived right back where it started. I thought for sure they would blow the promised delivery date. Amazingly, a few hours after tracking showed it arriving back at origin, I got a call from the local shipper to arrange delivery and it actually arrived a day early. Nice. But just a heads-up if you buy one and it ships CEVA. Something is very odd about their tracking page and it is basically worthless IMHO.I gambled on buying this through Amazon since they aren't local to go see someone in person if it had been necessary and there was the risk of shipping damage. Neither was an issue. Not only did I get price protection (I waited through one price drop but a 2nd one came within days of ordering so price protection is nice), but there was no damage whatsoever and I didn't have to get someone with a truck to help me pick it up at the store. I just helped the delivery guy carry it from his truck to my living room.The set itself is everything I had thought it would be and more. I had seen other Opticontrast panels before but it is absolutely stunning in my living room. As some apparently say about these sets, it does look more real than real.5 stars without a doubt. I have no problem recommending this set to anyone.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV,GREAT PIC AND THIN BUT FACTORY DEFECT SONY REFUSED TO REPLACE", "Author": "ALEXCAT", "ReviewID": "R2W0TRGL95H0FY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV on Jun 17, 2011 and would like to say that out of the box it needed zero adjusting. Great picture and the 3D is excellent aside from a little ghosting. My only issue that I am currently trying to reslove with Sony as I write this, is the tv is very thin and borderless. Pretty much the gorilla glass used is the whole front part glued to the back(no screws visible). The glass on my unit has begun to be unglued on the left side of the tv about 2 inches. It is not peeling off but to the point where u can clearly see light coming out of the side of the Tv. This I am sure is not good and am in the process of getting it repaired. Will add to my review if Sony charges for any repairs to this already expensive TV that is clearly a Factory defect.I am updating my review today October 9th 2011. I am dissapointed to say Sonys warranty and repair Department is the worst I have ever had to deal with in my life. Needless to say, they refused to properly repair this very expensive tv of mine. After 1 month and a 2 week stay at there local repair shop, my tv was returned to me in the same exact condition it was received. Not only did they not repair it but the have refused to replace it for a nondefective one, as the concluded the tv is suppose to be that way. I have posted a Pic of the problem with the glass ungluing and you be the judge and decide if that is normal. I am not telling anyone not to buy Sony products but just be aware they dont live up to there warranty. All this being said, after 1 month of dealing with Sony and there terrible warranty dept., I called Amazon out of desperation to see if they can assist me in dealing with Sony. After explaining the situation to them and a 5 minute hold, I was greeted with a suprise I was not expecting. Amazon rep told me, they were sorry what had happen to me and would be sending out a replacement television and accepting my defective one. All this well beyond my 30 day window. 3 months beyond to be exact. 1 week later my new TV arrived and it is in perfect condition. I am very greatful to Amazon for this and this should serve a lesson to Sony on how to handle a defective product and how to treat loyal customers. Cheers to Amazon and a million jeers for Sony. Thank u Amazon.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sexy with no bleedthrough", "Author": "Danation", "ReviewID": "R1BG8IQZWAOJL1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a long time reviewing TVs before making a purchase and I'm very glad I took a chance on this relatively new Sony. It appears to have all the features of the more expensive XBR series but uses local-dimming edge lit LEDs rather than back-lighting. This makes it thinner, which was more important to me than image quality for my application. I also like that it has a uniform thickness and looks great mounted on an island in my home. It is strange how few companies care about the view from the back...Update the firmware as soon as you get it so that the newer features like video streaming and iPhone media remote (available through app store) work properly. Qriocity didn't work due to the recent security breach but should be back up soon. Netflix streaming and Pandora work perfectly. The presence sensor is nice when set to only do motion detection otherwise it performs poorly for facial recognition when you are heavily backlit. I have windows behind me and many times the settings page would say the presence sensor is not functioning properly. I thought it was broken until I tried later at night. It worked great then and was almost creepy how it changes the sounds and picture based on where you are in the room. I also like the feature which prevents children from getting to close to the screen. The facebook and weather widgets are based on Yahoo! widgets and I have to say that they are pretty gimmicky. They aren't fast and navigating within them is nowhere near as nice as the other built-in features. Weather, Facebook, Stocks, etc are so much easier to get to by grabbing my phone than working with the remote. Speaking of, the remote is strange in that it is big. It also has an extra power on/off button on the back. It looks really cool and is recessed to prevent inadvertent presses.DLNA streaming leaves a little be desired because it doesn't support MKV files, XVID, or other popular video formats. It also took a long time to start rendering/playing a plain mpeg file I sent via my Windows 7 laptop. Simply plugging in my WDTV Live for DLNA streaming from my laptop solved all that and worked so much better. Pictures and music seemed to work fine however. When hooked up to a Windows 7 Media Center PC via HDMI or DVI, the screen looked better than my own computer's LCD. It was so clear and crisp that it can easily be used instead of a projector for presentations and Starcraft II looked amazing.The Gorilla Glass monolithic design is just plain sexy. I like it better than the D8000 Samsung. To me, the Samsung sets looked a little too plastic-y even though the very small bezel looked so awesome from far away. The HX820 looks like a solid piece of black glass when it is off. I receive a lot of comments from people just walking past it in the room. The stand it comes with is a very nice and sturdy with a sort of brushed/anodized look to it. It is very classy.Even though the screen is very bright, the glossiness is troublesome at time. There is a lower end Sony that comes with a matte screen and slightly lower feature set that would provide me with better viewing but it just doesn't look as badass sitting up there.The internet browser doesn't really work well and I found it troublesome that it tries to load Sony's own web page upon startup and then after a couple minutes(!) fails with a message that the page is too large. So much for testing before shipping. I'm sure future firmware updates will resolve this and I love the idea that it updates itself. The only real area I feel Sony missed the mark with this TV is that they went through the trouble of adding the presence sensor and Skype but you still need another camera to use Skype. I know the built-in one is very poor quality but it seems like it would have been easy to make a dual purpose camera.Overall, this is the best TV I've owned. Add to that Amazon's price protection policy if the price decreases after you buy it for refunds and you really cannot go wrong pulling the trigger.A note on shipping: It was delayed more than 4 days from the estimate given to me due to some ambiguous \"external factors\". I'll let that slide though because I assumed it was due to the tornado(s) in the middle states. The delivery service was very good about calling to schedule times and the guys that came did an nice job plugging it in to be sure it worked before leaving.Overall, great buying experience, great TV, and great shipping.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Compare with Samsung D8000 55\"", "Author": "Suman Chakraborty", "ReviewID": "R38DY5NTPLM8MP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I have owned both of these TVs over the last month. I am no expert and will break my review based on my subjective experience.DesignThis is a subjective matter (would encourage others to take a look at both the TVs at stores before final purchase). However I felt that the Sony TV has a much better finish as compared to the Samsung D8000 (My Samsung had top right end slight protruding out of the bezel edges). The Sony looks just like a picture frame and feels picture perfect with the all glossy Black finish. With a Sony you can also tilt the TV to a certain angle (The angle is fixed though), similar to tilting a laptop screen while working.PictureMost important part. The Samsungs have really Vibrant color and they seem to come and hit you right in your face while the Sony seems more balanced and authentic (Compare a Bose system {Samsung} to the high end audiophile systems like a Aperion or Klipsch {Sony}.).The 3D, I felt looked better with an WOW factor (like in Movies) in Sony as compared to Samsung. Things seemed to fly out of screens unlike in Samsung.However I had a very interesting observation. While watching movies on Samsung I felt I was watching a Home Video (Video shot on your personal Handycam). With Sony I felt I was watching a real movie. Do others feel the same while watching a Samsung??SoundSony performs much better here and also has 5.1 output when connected to external speakers through an optical cable from the TV.ImplementationSony has some cool features like Presence sensor and automatic adjustment of picture while watching TV but they are not completely bug free. However compared to a Samsung this is an added advantage and just builds the WOW factor.Additionally the Sony has a Corning Gorilla Glass which is great (compared to the Sony, the Samsung screen feels like cheap Plastic.)", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV, on or off. Great interface too.", "Author": "ALR", "ReviewID": "R1G6TT95TZOVCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most other reviewers (especially electronics guy) have commented on key details, so I'll only offer the following observations:* the motion flow does make a difference. We compared this in home to the latest Sharp and Samsung TVs (love generous return policies) and it was clearly evident in a number of sports broadcasts* I find that the Internet widgets are really really easy to use. I have a Mac Mini hooked up to it for things like ESPN3, but I do appreciate the Sony interface* the tv does look great. Other people posted about it and I scoffed, but the monolith design really looks amazing when it's off. If you put the tv in a room you do other entertaining in, you'll love itThe only negative I have to share is:* there is *significant* glare from this tv. If you have it in a media room, or have curtains in the room, you'll be fine. But if you try to watch this tv during the day in a room with even mild non-direct sunlight, there is a ton of glare that can be very distracting.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "great TV, a few querks", "Author": "ryan c.", "ReviewID": "RZCUF4123VDPU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I  bought this TV with a lot of anticipation. After comparing it to the Samsung 8000, the Panasonic plasmas, and the LG LW series, it stood out as the best for watching movies, if movies aren't your thing, a Samsung is probably a better buy, and yet comes with the free 3D glasses as well, whereas you gotta purchase them separately with Sony, which I will, and you also have to buy the skype cam, which I wont.Now for this TV's features, the build quality and materials and fantastic, there is no \"cheap\" plastic on the set, everything is screwed together well, and the screen, in agreement with the other reviews out there, is superb, powered on or off.EXCEPT for one thing, the TV sat lopsided on the stand- yes there was about an inch of difference in clearance between the left and right corners (as you're facing the TV, the right lower edge dipped below the left edge). I called Sony, who were great and sent someone within a day to have a look, they fixed it by about 90%, that is, there was still 2-3 mm of difference between the 2 edges, which they said was a manufacturing defect, and although barely noticeable, I decided I couldn't live with it and decided to return the TV, and here is where I CAUTION EVERYONE:When making such a huge purchase, don't make the mistake of going through some 3 rd party retailers like I did, instead, buy direct from amazon, the 3rd party retailer would not absorb return shipping costs and I am $180 out of pocket for buying a defective product. Amazon has a free return shipping policy.Other than that the TV is a quality product, and I hope I get a set that is not defective the next time around.All in all, here are the pros: picture quality, picture and screen settings, build quality, looks, integrates seamlessly with sony stereo system (if you have one, you can operate both with your TV's remote), good value for the money (price has dropped significantly from $2700 a couple of months ago)and the cons: remote not user friendly, harder to access online content, stand not too sturdy, some glare in bright rooms, a bit too glossyI will edit this review after I receive my replacement set and share my 3 D experience in-house", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony 55HX820 VS Samsung 55C8000", "Author": "Big Frog", "ReviewID": "RACN7ZOHM75HR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this Sony 55HX820, which is replacing an old Samsung DLP in the living room. I have a Samsung's 2010 Flag Ship model 55C8000 in my bedroom for more than 9 months now.Price:I bought this Sony 55HX820 for $1399, including TV, a Sony 3D Bundle/Narnia Glasses and a Sony BDP-S480 Blu-ray Disc Player (Black) at Frys B&M.; I bought my Samsung UN55C8000 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV for $1900 from Amazon this January, also including 3D kit and 3D Bluray player. Both are super good deals. But you can see Sony really prices its Top Line Edge-Lit TV much more aggressively than Samsung.Picture Quality:Both TV's picture quality are fantastic. But Samsung model is inferior in 2 aspects. First, out of box, the Samsung TV looks horrible. The color is just not right. I have to use the recommanded setting from CNet to make it work. This Sony, out of box, is close to perfect. I do not even bother to look for a professional setting. Second, this sony is able to deliver much better picture if the source is not perfect, say, a 480i source TV program. Same TV program would look much more grainy in Samsung, but much better in the Sony.Motion BlurThe Sony is simply the winner. My Samsung suffers a little motion blur espcially for human face, mouth movement etc, but definitely nothing in the Sony. Samsung's motion blur only appears in TV program, not in Bluray program. I have to say, for real life TV watching experience, the Sony is just better.Black and WhiteBoth are superb. I have absolutely no complain. The blacks are very deep. White is also bright.Flash Lights / Ghost ImageNeither set has corner flash light. My Samsung has absolutely no ghost image in dark scene. But it does show some lighting issue for scenes like an acknowledge screen with a white actor name in the middle surounded in pure black. This sony has very few ghost image in dark scene noticable in a extremely dark room. It does exist though. I am extremely sensitive to Ghost image and other flash issue. I actually returned a Toshiba TV for that reason. But this issue for this Sony is not severe at all.Screen UniformityOther than flash light/Ghost image, LCD may suffers other screen uniformity issue, such as Banding. My Samsung has a little vertical banding issue. It is the kind of issue that normal viewer would not even notice, but I cannot say it is not there. This sony has no banding at all.Glossy / ReflectionBoth TVs are a bit Glossy. The Sony is a bit more. But I think both are doing pretty OK.3DImage quality wise, both are pretty good and leading other brands. But watching Samsung makes me a little bit headache. This Sony's 3D image is very very comfortable to watch. Thank you, Sony. But ..., the Sony's 3D glasses are really uncomfortable. I like my Samsung glasses much more.SoundBoth are very good and much better than the returned Toshiba LED TV. The Samsung actually sounds a little better than the Sony.Connectivity / Net TVThis Sony is much much better. It has Amazon Instant, Skype, Hulu, etc and etc. I cannot find anything it does not have actually.All in all, I would say, I love my Sony much more than the Samsung. It is just a better TV.

I was also surprised to see that I can use it as a computer display, which I have not tried out yet, but I can't wait (HBO Go!).  Some of the features I did not know about until I checked on them:  the dolby decoder.  I have Dish Network and the sound has always been mono - but no more!  The sound of this TV, using its built-in speakers, with no external speakers or home theater, is super.  I called Sony to verify that the TV was actually receiving and decoding Dolby signals from the various networks and other sources.  Streaming on Netflix is flawless, gorgeous.  I do not have a blu-ray DVD player yet, but I am sure it will be absolutely gorgeous on this TV.  Features on this TV are infinitely variable - and worth every penny.

I got it very quickly through Amazon's great shipping department (3 days after ordering it).  It took a total of 10 minutes to unpack, attach the base, and make it through the setup process.  Linking my Netflix and Amazon streaming video was a snap also.  The sound is very good, for just using the TV speakers alone.  I am going to set it up with a home theater system as soon as I decide on witch one to buy.  I have an LG sound-bar that I used on the Samsung TV that this one replaced, but I want to go for a true home theater system.  I did not run into any problems with the picture quality, in fact, the 2D system is the best that I have ever had (I have not used the 3D yet, and probably won't for a while, though I did get one pair of Sony active 3D glasses with it.  The local dimming has shown no problems that were reported in some of the reviews for this set.  This is the second Sony TV that I have owned, the other one was a rear projection 50\" that I purchased some 5 years ago and that I replaced with the Samsung LED TV that this one replaced.  My experience with that TV was not as good as this one, and I was a little apprehensive when I first ordered it.  I am glad I chose to ignore some of the reviews that had been posted that gave it poor marks for the local dimming and am glad I did.  I would highly recommend this TV to anyone wishing to have a 46\" class TV.  I am confident that it will last me a very long time.UPDATE after a month and a half of using it:  I paired this TV with Sony HT-CT150 3D Sound Bar System a week or more after I installed the TV.  The Bravia TV has performed well beyond my expectations.  With the addition of the sound bar it has made it a true joy to watch.  Being mostly home bound, due to medical issues, I had not been watching TV as much as one would think, but now I am watching this TV 6 to 7 hours a day and enjoying it.  I love the smooth integration with my home network and being able to use the Qriocity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime video streaming applications.  The picture remains to be the best quality that I have ever experienced and with the addition of the sound-bar (my home is too small for a full blown home theater system) it has been even better.  I have had absolutely zero problems with the system.  This was a fantastic buy from Amazon, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who has limited space and who really enjoys great movies and TV shows.  It was a nobrainer setting up and I am convinced that I will have years of great viewing on it.

Franco", "ReviewID": "R10ZPTI2PC8T7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As others have mentioned, this TV produces a great picture with very deep blacks and smooth motion.  There are, however, a couple of issues that have been raised in other reviews that I'd like to address:(1) This model suffers from a screen abnormality also known as \"the crease.\"  The crease is a line or a series of lines that can be either vertical or horizontal, and which are visible mostly while the TV is displaying solid backgrounds.  The first sample of this model that I got had this problem.  In my case, it was a rather thick (about 10 pixels) vertical line located on the left side of the screen. It was visible no matter what I was watching.  It was so distracting that I didn't think twice about requesting an exchange.  The replacement sample that I got was perfect and I'm very happy with it, but I've read about people who have gotten several samples with the same issue.(2) Several reviewers have complained about the stand.  In my opinion, the stand for this TV is fantastic.  I'm not sure if the reviewers that have complained about it received bad samples or if they did not put it together correctly.  Just to be sure, make sure you tighten the screws simultaneously while you're putting it together so that it is balanced.  Once the TV is placed on top of the stand, it should not lean to either side.  The stand allows the TV to swivel horizontally and to be tilted up like an iMac.  I find this to be absolutely perfect for my application.  Some times we don't sit directly in front of the TV and want to move it so that it is facing us.  The stand's swivel action allows for this to be done very easily.  No need to move the stand itself.  I'm guessing people are unnerved by how flimsy it appears to be, but appearances can be deceiving in this case.  If you tighten everything correctly, there's no way the TV will topple over unless you're trying to do it on purpose, and even so, it will be difficult.(3) I've watched a couple of 3D movies and have played a 3D video game (Wipeout HD). So far, I'm very impressed by how well 3D is displayed by this model.  There is a little bit of ghosting, but it isn't very distracting.  I think the 3D experience will depend a lot more on the movie than on the TV.  I've watched some 3D trailers that were extremely bad - for example, the last Harry Potter movie - while others have been great.  This leads me to put the blame on the movie's 3D implementation, which isn't too surprising as 3D is mostly a Hollywood marketing gimmick at the moment.  Hopefully this will change.So, all in all, this TV is nearly perfect provided you get a good sample.  Make sure you buy it from a dealer with a liberal exchange policy.  I bought mine from Tiger Direct and they were great about my exchange.  Amazon is also known for being very helpful.  In my opinion, this TV is so perfect that it is worth the hassle of going through several samples.  However, if you are not willing to put up with this, I would stay away from it and buy something else.  Keep in mind that LED TVs are known for screen abnormalities, you should probably look at other technologies, such as Plasma if you don't want to deal with exchanges.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Less is more: stunning picture and design.", "Author": "loonscall", "ReviewID": "RBF6LE71ET7Q6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon delivered this TV exactly on time on the date promised.

I get 15 gorgeous local HD channels and Sony's on-board Rovi channel guide will make you second guess that cable bill.  I use the iPhone remote App designed by Sony and it turns operation of the TV, especially for online services needing lots of typing, a breeze. If you turn the iPhone over, it actually mutes the TV's volume automatically.  Way cool!  This is possible with the built in WiFi. It has a built-in camera for sensor-presence that will send a signal out if a child is too-close as well as shut the TV off in an empty room.The TV has three rear firing 10w speakers and the sound is actually pretty good considering the super-thin design. I do have an audio amp hookup for film watching. There are numerous options for audio adjustments as well.I am very pleased with my purchase. It is the coolest TV I have ever seen let alone ever owned!  Sony is an iconic brand and I am happy they are back totheir early days of amazing design and quality.

When I phoned Sony to complain about it being refurbished, they said that after 60 days, they would not replace it with a new model. I had not had the tv 60 days but still ended up with a refurbished model.  Today when we set the tv up, the main screw to hold the tv in the bracket is missing.  I now have to call Sony back again.

I couldn't be a happier customer with the whole process.  With the standard free shipping, the next day after I placed the order I received a call from the trucking company to set up a delivery date and a convenient time for me.  As scheduled, the trucker arrived, removed the TV from the box, and tested the on/off.  I was relieved with my decision to buy online.The best part was yet to come.  The TV when turned off is awesome looking--only 1-1/8\" thick with an all-glass front.  The 46\" screen for our size room is perfect--during my research I measured the viewing distance and followed the guidelines for the screen size.  We got rid of our old, large entertainment center and ordered a bookcase for the stand, 30\" high--guidelines suggest viewing at eye level.  Another successful hurdle.The Sony Bravia KDL46HX820 is amazing, better than real life.  I didn't select this model for the internet or the 3D, but solely for the picture quality.  The best picture I've ever seen or imagined--richer looking than the movie theater.  We updated our satellite receiver for high definition, which required a new satellite dish at no extra cost with an extended agreement.  We bought a new blu-ray player and a few blu-ray movies.  The last three weeks we've been like kids with our new toy...grown up toy!I was concerned there might be glare with our many windows and nighttime lighting.  There is some reflection when the scene goes black, but considerably less than our 12 year old Sony Vega Trinitron.  The sound to me was better than the reviews I read.  Someday after we recover from our purchases, we might get new speakers.  I found the TV stand/base to be more stable than I read; my active 50-pound Vizsla hasn't made it shake yet.

Rich", "ReviewID": "RS2WY4W61H35M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is for the Sony 55HX820.  I have had this television for several weeks now.  If you're reading this, you probably already know that this edge-lit LED television sits between the top of the line XBR929 (a full array LED) and the NX720 and the HX729 in Sony's 2011 television lineup.  Please note that I am informed that this television has been discontinued, and is no longer available from Sony or from wholesalers, but, as of this writing, is still available from Amazon and some of its marketplace vendors.First the strengths.  As other reviewers have noted, this television (like the NX720 and the XBR929), is razor thin and boasts Sony's \"Gorilla\" glass, which covers the entire screen and border.  The set is striking and attractive even when not turned on.  It looks like a brilliant black pane of glass.  When turned on, its picture is strikingly crisp and impressive, with rich colors and tremendous detail (but see below).  You will not see better black levels on any television in this price range.  While I did not see this model in the store before I purchased it, I was able to compare the other Sony high end televisions (the ones noted above) to the Samsung high end LED televisions (the 7000 and 8000 series) and while the Samsungs were impressive, I thought that the Sony sets had the better and more realistic picture, as well as better build quality and aesthetics.  If put together correctly (lay the television face-down flat and attach the stand to the television,  not the other way around), the television sits nicely on the included stand, and although it can be a bit wobbly, it seems secure enough, and is level, or very, very close to it.  The picture is most impressive when viewed directly, or nearly directly, from the front.  There is little noticeable glare in my viewing environment.  The sound -- and I am picky about sound -- of the television's built in, rear firing speakers is much better than other reviewers would have you believe.  Of course, it is better to hook the television up to an external sound system, which will make a huge difference in the viewing and listening experience.  Please not that this television has both analogue and digital audio outputs (but see below).  The 3D is terrific; much, much better than I expected based on the other reviews of Sony televisions.  Rather expensive active 3D glasses are, however, required and must be purchased separately.  (The best deals are the package sets with two pairs of glasses and a 3D movie).  I purchased the BR250 series Sony glasses and they work fine.  Connection to the internet is relatively easy if you have a wireless internet router.  While I have not used the internet much, it is very nice to easily search for and view film content from YouTube on the television.Now the weaknesses.  This model is marketed as boasting higher end motion processing than the step down NX720.  On video content, the motion processing is very, very good.  On sports, however, on longer distance scenes showing the whole football field or basketball court, there can be blurring around the players, even when they are lining up for a play.  The quality of the picture on these shots is also not crisp.  This was hugely disappointing for me, as I purchased this particular, more expensive, model principally to obtain the better motion processing for sports.  (I also noticed a bit of blurring on the lips of someone singing in a non-sports program).  Close ups, on the other hand, are crystal clear and impressive.  If you are purchasing the set for sports, you might consider ponying up the extra dough for the XBR929 (which supposedly has better motion processing), consider a plasma set (particularly the Panasonics or the Samsungs) or wait until next year's models are released and the LED technology improves.  Having said this, I compared the step down Sony HX729 to Panasonic's second best plasma set, and on movies, the Sony had a superior picture.  The second problem, at least on my set, is that the digital audio (optical) output does not work correctly, as it does not permit you to turn the television speakers off and have variable audio output to an external sound system.  I contacted Sony and was informed that this was a defect in my unit.  Because I am using the analog audio output, and everything else about the television seems fine (other than the motion on some sports; there is no problem with the stand, no crease issue, no lighting problems on the screen), I have chosen, for now, to keep the set.  I hope that I don't regret that decision.I strongly recommend (if you can afford it and fit it into your viewing room) purchasing the 55 inch, rather than the 46 inch, model.  Yes it's large, but the bigger screen makes a difference.  After a few weeks, it won't seem that large anymore.Ordering from Amazon is easy.  You can choose the date and delivery window when making your order.  Delivery is fast (just several days).  Please note that Pilot, one of the delivery services used by Amazon, now has a policy that the delivery person will not set up the set.  Pilot delivered my set, and there was only one delivery person making the delivery.  If I hadn't been available to assist, there was no way the delivery man would have been able to safely bring the set up my stairs and into my home.  So I assisted.  The delivery man, however, did unpack the set and put together the stand and correctly attach it to the television (although I provided the Allen wrench; he could not locate the one included with the set).  Amazon's return policy and price guarantees are nice features.Over the past few months there have been some significant price differences in the cost of the Sony units, which, overall, were at their very lowest between late November and early December of 2011.  The prices are higher now, as they were when I purchased this set in mid-late December, but I understand they are still far lower than they were earlier in 2011.  I suspect that there may be some good deals as we get closer to the release of the 2012 models, but this unit is in somewhat limited supply.In sum, this expensive set boasts a superior, striking, picture with the exception of some motion blurring on long shots (but not close ups) on sports (particularly football and basketball), as well as some terrific features.  It is worth strong consideration, particularly for any non-sports viewing.\u00a9 2012 D.A. Rich", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "KDL55 HX820 very good", "Author": "C. Hanson", "ReviewID": "R104TC15CPOI2N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This set is very nice looking and has many features included that make it worth the price. If you can find it on sale, it is an excellent value.  The picture is crisp and clear, the 3D is amazing and I like the fact that I don't need the sync bar (which was required with the HX700 we had previously).  Shipping the product from WA to AZ took a day less than estimated, but I picked it up at the trucking warehouse, so the \"door to door\" time could have exceeded the estimated time of delivery.  Sound was just okay and I added a sound bar which improved the quality tremendously.Only a couple of issues to bring the rating down from 5 stars to 4....1) Installation with wall mount - the \"universal\" wall mount I bought was universal to everything except this Sony....the mount bolt pattern on the TV is at a slight inward angle from vertical (think of a V pattern).  I had to widen the both the upper and lower holes on the mounting brackets so it would fit the bolt pattern on the TV.  Not difficult if your handy with drills and such, but it slowed the install down and was frustrating.  2) After about one month, the set had been operating perfectly, then one evening it started acting up.  It would turn on and off repeatedly, and after three attempts would shut down and the red LED light on the front blinked 8 times then stop for 3 seconds and then repeat.  After some time wasted with the on-line help center I called Sony help line directly and got some clear info.  The 8 blinks on this set means that an automatic software update was interrupted by a power loss to the set.  Not sure how this happened because we did not notice any outage in our area, but that's irrelevant.  The fix was to do a \"power reset\" which returns all settings to \"factory setting\".  Be aware that if you pay for \"professional\" set-up that all of that will be erased by the power reset.  You will have to redo the entire \"initial\" set up that you did the first day you bought the set.  Once the reset was done and I reset all the preferences, passwords and internet connection, the TV has worked fine. But it was annoying to have the set go out so unexpectedly.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bravia Beautiful", "Author": "G.

This unit replaced a 46\" XBR, which, is still running strong.  The primary reason for the upgrade was 1st - 3D capability, 2nd - size.  This unit, mounted on the wall, has the same footprint as the XBR did, due to Sony's design, and therefore, was able to upgrade pic size without compromising space already allocated.  Extremely pleased with this unit, however, a few minor items that I would like to disclose.  The device does not have an S-Video input.  It comes with a dongle, that accepts one component, and one composite connection. I was able to get an S-Video adapter to convert to the composite, so no issue.  This connection is used for Laserdisc playback.  This unit has sensors in it for various reasons, one being, detection of someone being too close to the unit, which throws up a message requiring your action to reactiviate the picture when someone gets to close to the screen.  Not sure what keeps causing this to activiate on my set, as again, it is mounted on the wall and, activated a few times when I was more that 10 feet from the screen.  I disabled this functionality for now.  Lastly, WiFi ready, however, if you are not broadcasting your SSID, you may have trouble connecting to your wireless network.  Not sure why this is the case, but I have only been successful connecting to a wireless netwrok that is broadcasting the SSID.

My biggest disappointment has got to be the internet features. Partly why I bought this TV over some of the others that were slightly cheaper is for the Internet connected features. I had pictured myself getting the TV all set up with no wires except for power coming out of it and it will have everything I could need to enjoy my TV without even needing a cable box. Netflix, Amazon's video service, youtube, RSS feeds. This is my first TV in 5 years and I figured if I lasted without cable this long, I surely can keep going and watch all the stuff I was watching on my laptop via my shinny, new, big TV.The features are all slow and not super user friendly. The video services all work and provide good picture but they are very annoying to search and the user interfaces aren't very good. There is an RSS section that I got super excited about... I thought I would be able to add my own feeds from stuff like Epic Meal Time or Scam School. This TV has it's own predefined feeds and some are out of date or don't even exist anymore. BIG disappointment.I next figured I could just use the built in web browser... This TV can play various formats that you can plug in via USB so why not play them off the web? The web browser wont play any videos. No youtube (only played in the built-in app), no vimeo, rev3. I even visited some PS3 formatted websites thinking this TV would at the very least be able to handle that. No video.The more I write about it, is the more I'm getting bummed. I'll probably get a Apple TV to fix what I thought this TV would've been able to handle.

It replaced a still-working-fine Sony Bravia 52XBR4.  I purchased the KDL55HX820 because of the thinness and the updated features (compared to my Bravia).  I placed the order with Amazon on a Monday morning and the television, delivered by CEVA Logistics Freight, was on my wall by Saturday afternoon.  CEVA in Miami was a pleasure to work with and the driver not only carrier the tv upstairs, but made sure it worked properly before leaving.The picture is sharp from every angle of the room.  It required no adjustments.  We did have a problem with the Comcast HD-DVR box in that the Comcast DCT6412 had no (working) HDMI interface and required component connection.  When Sony states they have \"component hybrid,\" it really means they have a dongle that dangles from your sleek television that you put the component plugs into.  Awful!  It also could NOT carry the signal of the Comcast DCT6412.  Luckily, I live a mile from a Comcast office and 48 hours later, swapped my DCT6412 for a newer DCT3416.  I plugged the HDMI in and all was perfect.On the same note, lack of component inputs, I was forced to move my Nintendo Wii to my bedroom Sony 32EX500.  The Wii does not have the ability to connect except with component cables.  I still have an X-Box 360 and a PS3, as well as an iPad connected to the new tv via the 4 HDMI inputs.The sound is not quite as robust as that of my previous Bravia.  I don't always use my home theater (Polk Audio center channel + 4 Bose speakers + JBL driven 10\" sub-woofer) for normal tv watching, however, it is nearly a necessity for good sound.  I do not have a big living room, so if you do, this might be a consideration before purchasing this tv.My home has a wireless network and making the connection between the KDL55HX820 was very easy.  The tv saw the network immediately and once the network password was entered, it joined.  The only flaw with using the tv to surf the web is that it is VERY difficult, nearly impossible, to navigate using the supplied Sony remote.  It needs a keyboard to be a pleasant, easy experience.  Speed has not been an issue though may depend on your internet provider.  I have AT&T; U-Verse 24MB (realistically 16-18MB) internet.  If you are on slower DSL, you might have a problem.I purchased this tv for $1749 from Amazon.  It was my first BIG purchase/major electronics purchase from Amazon.  I saved over $500 from our cheapest electronics retailer in Miami.

We're using Wi-Fi from about 30 ft from the wi-fi router, and we're able to watch HD content with very few delays--which mainly happen in the late evenings when the Internet traffic is high. I'm actually a little surprised that we get such steady streaming because our Internet plan only guarantees about 7Mbps, and I thought you had to have 10Mbps to get steady streaming of HD.

The unit arrived very nicely packed. The unit is really light weight (~60 pounds). So do make sure it is propped against a wall or something sturdy - the box can easily tilt over.  It's very easy to unpack; pull the four plastic locks at the bottom and the whole cardboard box can be lifted above the unit. I and my wife did it easily in under 5 minutes.The TV is very sleekly designed and looks great!! Nice black unit and very slim.Setup: Sony provides a tabletop stand, but with such a large unit that is light weight, it's always better to use wall mount or a stand with a mount to avoid accidental tilting. The base stand was easy to attach. Be cautious you can accidentally attach it backwards. There is an easy set-up menu (standard stuff such as time and date, tuning channels, other connected equipment etc). It did take me about an hour to make sure the TV was properly secured and all the units (bluray player, game console etc) were connected before turning it on.Setup was very easy including connecting to the internet (I used wifi - entering the password is a pain, but you can use WPS if your router allows it; The unit also has an ethernet port and you can use a wired connection). The user manual that comes with the unit only provides very minimal information. The i-manual accessible through the unit's software menu provides more detailed information.Video and Audio: The default settings provide excellent picture quality. I did not have to adjust anything. However, for the more demanding users, there is a choice of built-in presets as well as option to customize/modify the settings. The gorilla glass does provide very nice 'black contrast'. However, it reflects any minimal light you might have in the room. So the picture quality is great if you have a really nice dark room. A place like a living room with many windows perhaps is not a good place.Fast action videos are amazing to watch since there was no blur. I watched a few home videos (shot with a Sony HDR-CX110) where I was  clearly able to notice the difference between my previous 60Hz TV and this one.Audio quality is so so with the units stereo speakers- sufficient for the average user. It's worth mentioning that the unit has simulated surround sound (unlike HX729, the speakers are on the front of the unit and easy to hear). as always, if you had an audio system (home theater or so), it is better to use it than the unit's speakers.Features:1. network and internet: There are lots of features due to the internet capability. The unit can be set-up to work with your amazon movies, netflix, hulu account etc. If you have set-up a media streamer (e.g. Mezzmo) on your PC, the unit can very well connect to the server and display videos seamlessly. However, the quality depends on your network speed and bandwidth. With a wireless n router and my AMD quad-core PC, I was able to stream 720p videos very well, but 1080p videos were choppy. Sony also provides some free internet content (~250 movies, ~400 TV shows etc through a provider called 'Crackle'), but as you can imagine these movies are not box office hits. A note of caution though - most of these are R rated movies and I havent found a way how to restrict internet content based on rating. You can do that for the cable/antenna program though.2. 3D: The 3D capabilities of the TV are really great. I don't have other 3D units to compare but the quality was as good as the ones I have watched in theatres using active 3D glasses. The 3D depth and fast action scenes (like in Potter movies) are very good although the colors are not as vibrant as when you watch regular bluray movies. There is an internet link where you can watch some trial 3D clips.3. Other: There is a built-in camera at the bottom of the unit. It apparently has face detection capabilities so that the unit can adjust the audio and video according to where you are watching from. I haven't had a chance to test this. However the same camera detects when a small child is near by (with in 3ft of the screen) and then beeps and turns off the picture. We need to check until what age it works or how it detects child vs adult. but seems to be a nice feature - worked with a 4 yr old that we tested with.When setting ambient light contrast etc., you can actually see a preview from that camera, but don't know why we cant use it for skype (yes, skype is another feature on this tv)!!Cons:1. Like other reviewers have pointed out, there might be a slight tilt to the right with the provided stand depending on number of factors (placing on carpeted floor, glass top stand etc). This is especially true with the 55\" version.2. Many users complain about the bleed problem, but it appears only very little and only on the sides. It does not affect picture quality in anyway (ofcourse you watch tv from the front and not the side). I am not concerned about it.3. The software that drives the menu and setup is very slow and quite clunky. It froze and restarted the tv so many times initially. Due to the wifi connection, the unit did update the software automatically (prompts you when update is available). In the past week, I havent seen any restart or freeze.

This weekend (July 7th) the set just clicked off while we were watching it, and it would not power back on.  It's signalling a \"2 flashing red light\" error on the bottom of the set.  After troubleshooting with Sony over the phone, they would not confirm what the error meant, only that it looks like they will need to come to the house for a service visit.  Extremely disappointing after less than 5 months of use.Other than the fact that I can't currently use the TV, it is a nice looking set.  Blu-Ray movies and any sports programming look fantastic.  Unfortunately I have not been able to reproduce the same color and vibrance of my 2006 Sony 40\" LCD XBR that it replaced, but this could be that I have not experimented enough with all of the settings.  It also reflects a lot more glare than my old LCD, which was a disappointment.  Finally, the small support stand it ships with (if you are not mounting it on a wall) is very flimsy.  I have only bought Sony televisions in the past and am used to far better quality from Sony.  I would not recommend this product and can only hope that the main problem of no longer being able to use it at all can be fixed.***Updated*** Sony arranged for a technician to come to my house on July 11th and repaired the set under warranty.

As usual we did our surveys and locked-on to three -- the LG 55LW6500, the Samsung UN-55D8000 and the Sony KDL-55HX820... uh, what with those mouthful numbers!WHAT WAS BEING CONSIDERED?1. A 55\" or more screen space;2. Got to be a 3D-TV;3. Obviously the best in picture quality;4. Had to have a built-in Wi-Fi;5. Should depict premium quality, w/out costing a 'bomb';OVERVIEW:Surely, the 'considerations' warranted the top-of-the-line models of the leading manufacturers, but alas! they were expensive by [nearly]double to their own 2nd best models. So, we decided to look at their next lineage and soon understood that either they didn't make 60\"/65\" ones in that profile or it'd be priced extravagantly. So, we settled for the 55-inchers.WHY THE SONY?Well, we had long condoned 'Plasmas', why? it's another discussion alltogether. As LEDs were to be our buy we found that the three (mentioned before) were pretty comparative in their performance & similar in their price range... it thus, had to be either of them. We were also quite 'sold-on' to the LG's 'passive glasses' (could've saved-on the after market eyewear costs), but one look at the Sony would definitely keep you dumbfounded! This piece is gorgeous to the bone. We'd've purchased it anyway even if it wasn't that much of a performer, surprisingly it is too! Worked on them side-by-side at futureshop.ca -- found that the Sony's 55\" HX820 actually performs much better than the Samsung's D8000, and doles-out nearly twice the effect of the LG's 6500 [NOTE: Contrary to C|Net's opinion, don't go for the LG's 5600 models - their 6500's are much better].DECISION TAKEN:Given the real-time output of the Sony's 55HX820, it'd be potent to mention that this TV beats them all, even it's own flagship model - the XBR929. Why? for one - it drives on the same X-Reality PRO engine, the similar MotionFlow XR-480 video-tech, the same Gorilla glass facia and every single feature of it's elder brother... but giving-out a tad better picture & 3D effect than it, while keeping the prices down by about 50%. Yes, the XBR is 'back-lit' while this one is 'edge-lit' and the XBR has MotionFlow XR-960, while this one has 480... but what the heck? the HX820 still outperforms the XBR and I do not see any difference in its 'deep blacks', color-rendering, motion flow etc. So why pay more? -given the fact that both kept side by side, no one would notice the difference - they both share the same form factor, while mine (the HX820) being way thinner.MORE ON THE FORM FACTOR:Remember, the LG, the Samsung (and all others) are typically a \"LCD screen with a bezel\" TV... while the Sony HX820 isn't! Ditto the XBR. This is an \"all-screen\" TV... no bezels / no LCD screens to safeguard for! It's a \"single piece of glass\" in front. What that means? [1]it looks like a 'pictureframe', unlike any other TV, [2]that glass is Gorilla glass, it's scratch resistant (rings any bell?), [3]it thus looks awesome even when switched-off! Take it from me, no one, I repeat no one, who entered my house ever stopped exclaiming, \"OH, MY...\" (no, it's not for the Sharp 'Quattron', if you know what I mean!!!).THE 3D EXPERIENCE:So, I've already clogged over 1200 hrs. on this TV now (uh, am I talking about flying!)... purchased four 'active-shutter' glasses from e-Bay (Sony BR250), sad Sony didn't offer any with the TV, but no issues though, and also fetched a bag-full of 3D blu rays - \"Avatar-3D\" (no one in their sane mind can miss that!), \"Sharks-3D\", \"Imax-Under the Sea\" (these two are a must to experience the best & 'real' 3D effects, Final Destination-3, Transformers-3, Rio-3D, \"Resident Evil: Afterlife\", Pirates of the Caribbean-3D and many more... now it's my turn to say, \"OH, MY...\", this TV gets into your skin while watching 3D content... goose-bumps galore... I've seen many other 3D TVs in action, surely the two mentioned before, the Sony HX820 produces amazing results on 3D blu rays. The 'depth' on Avatar-3D is such that you'd feel you are 'in' the movie - living in 'Pandora'... and while watching Rio-3D, I must admit, I could almost touch the hand of Jesus (remember the scene?) - it actually 'pops-out'! And then, all those marine lives, on the Imax 3D blu rays, really float right in front of you, out of the TV. While all the time in full HD (1080p) - Beat that! The LG's 'passive 3D' couldn't (it's not that 'crisp'), neither the Samsung's (it wasn't that wholesome).OTHER FEATURES:About DLNA, Wi-Fi, online apps, user interface etc. I leave them alone, b'coz my intent is to put forth an 'user review' rather than go techy... they are all well documented in every online review... u bet, those work just as fine as well.BOTTOMLINE:If you are in the foray for a 'new buy' - rest assured, this TV is well worth your money. It's almost a perfect 3D-TV (I said 'almost' b'coz one never knows what's in store tomorrow), but today, if LED-3D-TV is your call - this one's better than the rest. And I've seen it all, seriously. Ditto, if you are contemplating between the Samsung D8000 or the LG 6500 or the Sony HX820 - I'd suggest take the Sony KDL-55HX820 - this one is too damn good to resist!MY SETUP:The Sony 55\" HX820 is wall mounted, Sony PS3 & Sony BDP-BX58 are it's 3D blu ray players. Harman/Kardon HS300 is connected as its home theatre receiver, an 'optical cable' carries 5.1 channel audio between the TV & the receiver (I'm hearing the TV channel's sound thru the Harman/Kardon as well). The eyewear is Sony 3D BR250 & PS3-3D rechargeable glasses (both work absolutely fine). Rogers Cable (Set-top box with all HD channels). ACN home router for Wi-Fi internet. The distance between my TV & regular seating position is roughly 12-14 feet... yes, no issues with that distance.NOTE:Did I mention that this Sony HX820 has also a camera & is Skype enabled? And has a proximity sensor to alert you when your kids are too close to the TV?Go for it !!!QORAX", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Baxter Stockman", "ReviewID": "R201AQZ6XU2O1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is really great.

Tucker \"Dogman\"", "ReviewID": "R17FUHKD4SNBAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I am very pleased with this TV.  I've had it for about a month and I've held off adding my review until I've had a chance to watch the TV in different setting and learn all its features.Let me first say that AMAZON has the best price that I've seen.  I've been looking at the prices for the last 7 months and have seen AMAZON consistency with the lowest price.  I believe this model television is the best kept secret for 2011 LED's.  There aren't many reviews on the internet and what I have learned about the TV I learned from online forums.  I did go to BB and checked the TV out at their Magnolia store comparing the Samsungs D8000, Sony's HX929 and SonyNX729 models, these are the models I narrowed my selection to.  After looking at them in the store I narrowed my selection to the HX929 or HX820 models.  Price and the TV's being very close in features was what was the deciding factor for me, I pulled the trigger on the HX820.  Let me say the TV is very thin; it looks stunning when hung on a wall.  The TV was very easy to hang on the wall (bought the Sanus mount on AMAZON best price) and went up with no issues.  The TV synced to my Comcast remote and BluRay player automatically so there was no messing around with it.  Setting up the WIFI was also easy as I had to only enter in the routing number and it synced automatically.  Netflix, AMAZON, Hulu and the other streaming sites work perfectly with no lag or issues.  I haven't used the 3D yet so I won't comment on it.  Browsing the internet using the TV is slow, actually to slow for me so I just jump on my computer when using the internet.  There is a little glare with the Monolithic/gorilla glass, mine is set up in a room with two windows.  The picture out of the box is simply stunning, I've tweaked it a bit, changing the picture setting to custom, and then warm 1 as I believe this has a more realistic look to the picture.  Other than that I have not changed any of the setting and let me say this set has tons of then.  I haven't seen any clouding or creases issues in this set as some of the reviews have stated.  The only thing I don't like about this TV is the I-manual, Sony has gone green and doesn't include paper user manuals, the manual is on the TV itself.  I am old fashioned I guess and like to have hard copies of manuals when learning about features on the TV.Over all I'm very happy, I would purchase the HX820 model again with no regrets.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quick picture quality review", "Author": "Josiah", "ReviewID": "R1P81BXQP6MIAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using the TV for a few days now and wanted to do a quick review on the quality of the picture for other potential buyers.I love the picture. I was really torn between this 55HX820 Bravia LED and a 55inch Panasonic plasma with similar features. I'm happy to say that this TV is great. To me it really breaks down to my biggest pet peeves, grainy blacks and blurred motion. I think that most new TVs (plasma or LED) have pretty good HD picture quality when the content you are watching is slow moving or still and the contrast is low. But what I looked for was a TV in my price range that gave the best contrast (deep blacks) and least blur when watching sports. This TV definitely delivers that. The blacks are very deep and I do not detect any grainy or dark blue tinge to it as some other reviews suggested. I don't see any \"bleeding\" of light in dark scenes. It really gives you some amazing contrast. There's nothing more distracting to me than watching a show or movie and seeing splotchy areas when the scene is dark. I have not seen that happen at all with this TV.Ok now on the the motion. When watching football, if you sit at the recommended viewing distance from the TV, you won't notice any blurring around the players. If you stand right in front of the TV (within 3 or 4 feet) of this 55 inch TV, you can see that there is some sort of motion processing or image smoothing going on just around the outline of the player in motion - and not the whole picture, just the object in motion. So, right out of the box when I was sitting up close to the screen like a kid with a new toy on Christmas, I noticed some blur right around the outline of the players running on the football field. And if you stare hard enough at that distance, you can see some kind of grainy blacks at times. But that's when you're actually close enough to pick out those small details. If you go back to even 5 or 6 feet away, you won't see that stuff. In fact, I love the picture. In my opinion, the picture is slightly better than the other plasma TVs I've seen in the store or in a couple of friends' homes - that comparison applies mostly when it comes to the blacks being very clean and not grainy. When viewing those plasmas (new or older)I have always noticed this slight \"sparkly movement\" in the picture when the scene is still. But I always liked the motion on plasma. I think the crisp motion on this TV is almost hard to tell the difference from plasma TVs (which I think have pretty crisp motion inherently).So the bottom line is that this TV (when you're not sitting right against the glass) has very good color with deep blacks AND has beautifully crisp motion for fast moving content like football games. It's super thin and looks good mounted on the wall whether it's turned on or off. It's cheap to own (about $16 per year to operate). And the universal remote will work with my cable box DVR and other various players. Also I downloaded an app from the android market for free that lets you use your phone or tablet as a remote control. Fantastic TV so far.Keep in mind that I haven't tried the 3D (no glasses) and haven't had much time to play with the apps.

I am upgrading from a 40 inch Sony v3000 that I nought 4 years ago. That tv was amazing. But granted I didn't know much about tvs back then. Later I learned all about ghosting and clouding and found out my tv had it too except I am not really sensitive to it. But I decided the next tv I am gonna get, I will make sure it's as flawless as it can be. Wanted to get the hx929 but it was a bit out of my price range so I went for the hx820 instead. I saw the previous version hx800 last year and got that one for a friend. That tv was the best tv price  vs performance wise according to many pro websites, and hx820 is supposed to improve over that too. So it was a blind purchase for me. Never saw this tv at a store and directly ordered it from amazon. Got it a week later with no shipping damage. They helped me to unpack it and plugged it in too to check if it's working. The first thing I said after looking at the tv was damnnn that looks soooo sexy. The monolithic design is just amazing. Anyway I set it up and started watching some local hd channels over the antenna and found the picture a bit too over saturated and grainy (and I am not picky at all so I was surprised at how bad the picture is to even make me notice..he'll even my mom noticed it and said something is wrong with the color. And thus began my very first try to calibrate a tv.The few reviews that came out for this tv, only one of them mentioned calibration settings tvinfo.com or something. And there settings sucked even more (no wonder they rated the tv low since they didn't know how to calibrate themselves). So I went to cnet's hx929 review and used it's setting. And wow..the improvement was just mind boggling. But I knew that's a local dimming tv and I have to calibrate it more to make it look even better. But I decided to do it at night with lights turned off so that I can check the clouding and flash lighting too.So in the dark I was able to see some flash lighting and very little clouding but wasn't alarmed coz I know every edge lit LCD and LEDs will have it. It's inherent to the technology they use.. So I started playing with the settings again..specially backlight and brightness and I got rid of 99% of the flash lighting and all of clouding. And then I wanted to see how this setting look in the morning and found out it's a bit too dark. So more playing with settings again and finally I was able to find that perfect balance in black level...color..no flash lighting and clouding ...in short AMAZING PICTURE.Among other things..I believe it handles motion well although I am not sensitive to it. The viewing angle isn't the best, it tends to lolose contrast at 30 degrees and at 60 degrees it's quite noticeable but it's true for all lcds and not a big concern for me. Some pro reviews mentioned problems with fast motion in blu ray at 1080p 24p although no USERS3D looks amazing although I am not a big 3 D person. S will hardly use it. Sound is terrible. Even my mom noticed it. So u probably need some external audio system. The extra Internet features are handy and there are plenty of them if you want to use them. I don't. I have it connected to my Mac (htpc)with hdmi and it works flawlessly in 1080p.All I will say is spend some time adjusting settings and it will look like a million bucks. If you are scared to mess with the settings get a pro calibrator. It will be worth it to extract 100% from what this tv can offer. Hope I have covered anything.

Well, not enough apparently.Pros:-AMAZING picture in MOST (see cons) 2D situations.-TV is sleek, thin and beautiful-Easy to tilt/turnCons:-Since this is one step down from the full-array LED TV, you will likely notice blotchy patches of light on a black screen or very dark scenes. Not a huge deal, but kind of annoying.-Gorilla Glass screen is beautiful, but the glare from any lights or windows opposite the TV irritates me greatly (I prefer a matte finish). Limits where I can satisfactorily place my TV in the room.-The streaming apps for this are NOT good at all. I have a Sony PS3 which plays Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc in a user friendly, PERFECT way, so I don't understand why my Sony TV can't even come close. The picture streaming through the TV has better picture, but many times has buffering issues and will give an error, not saving program progress. It also takes longer to load the menu.-Now for the BIG CON. I love 3D, that's why I bought this TV. I watch movies and play video games in 3D all the time, yet there is something that really bugs the crap out of me almost ALL the time. Crosstalk aka ghosting aka double images. There are settings to tweak it, but they are very limited. \"Depth Adjustment\" really is just deciding if you want the crosstalk in the background, middle or forefront (the latter seems to be the least of the three evils). Adjusting the brightness of the glasses doesn't really help this a whole lot.Now, initially I figured it was just something that was normal for 3D home technology. Then I watched some stuff on my sister's LG 3D TV and got pissed off. Her TV not only had perfect 3D images with NO crosstalk, but the forefront images seemed to reach out of the TV (this Sony doesn't really do that) AND it was WAAAAY cheaper! I know the technologies are different (mine is active (powered glasses) and hers is passive (non-powered glasses), but come on!* I found out that Sony offers polarizing filters to apply to the glasses to reduce the crosstalk. I called their customer service line and ordered some. They are free of charge, but be prepared to give your model and serial numbers. I am not going to hold my breath, but if they fix the problem, I'll update my review.*In closing, pretty good TV if you don't care about 3D, but if that's you, why pay more $$$ for the technology?", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Display Problem", "Author": "P.

This annoyed me a bit but I soon realized it was just the slow processor- Now comes the most astonishing part. There were 6 bars on my TV running vertically about 1/3 inch wide on the screen which are not visible unless there is a dark scene.  And once you notice them, it's hard not to see them.  These bars are darker than the rest of the screen and I can not believe this TV passed the Sony quality inspection.  I could not keep this TV for this reason alone.

My priorities were (in same order): awesome picture, enjoyable Smart TV experience, quality, good-looking design & cinema quality 3D experience. After poring over Consumer Reports article and CNET & PC World & PC Mag reviews I was really confused and torn between this Sony & 2 similar models, 1 from LG & 1 from Samsung. Finally, the Sony edged out the other 2 & I ordered it. It arrived yesterday and I installed it. And now I know I made the right decision. Sony's on-screen set-up was very easy to use. As soon as I completed it and the picture feed from Dish Network came up we were blown away!  The picture quality is indescribably good. First, it is so crisp and realistic. And the colors are so true-to-life. But the part that's hardest to describe is how the picture looks 3D even in 2D mode. The characters seem to jump off the screen into the room. The only thing I can compare it to is when I first got corrective eyewear for distance, and everything looked 3-dimensional for the first time in years when I put my new glasses on. Regarding other things I was looking for, within 10 minutes of plugging it in I had the TV set up with our wireless internet and was streaming a TV show on Netflix - couldn't have been easier & picture quality was equal to live broadcast & none of the buffering delays we had with our Wii. Just pulling the TV out of the box and assembling it with the heavy metal stand (unlike heavy use of plastic with so many others) was a testament to the quality. Already knew from seeing it in a retail store that the monolithic styling with the gorilla glass was a show-stopper but wasn't prepared for how stunning it looks in the hole over our fireplace. I've read some reviews on glare off the glass or the viewing angle being narrow, but I don't see what they're talking about. Finally, I charged the 3D glasses I'd purchased separately (bought both Harry Potter & Chronicles of Narnia bundles for total of $270, which was cheaper than buying 4 pairs of glasses alone) for just 30 minutes as light indicated they were fully charged and tested out the 3D.  All I can say is WOW!! Great 3D experience - don't know what negative reviews were referring to. Anyway, I LOVE my new Sony KDL46HX820 - it was worth every penny.

VUDU is not included in the apps4. no asian language support. (most of my youtube video subscriptions and favorites are displayed in [][][])These are very minor. Except the caption issue with NetApp, the rest are kinda expected. I wouldn't take more than 1 points out of 5.However, after one and half weeks of enjoyment, some of the digital channels started to show low SNR and high error rate. If we connect the same coax cable to other LED/LCD we have, no SNR and high error problem at all. SNR stays at 31-35db and no decoding errors. So it is clearly not the cable company's problem.Today, all the digital channels started to acting up. the tuner can't lock to the signal. Again, the Sharp 40LE830U can receive and decode the signal from the same coax cable just fine.It is getting to \"30 day free return\" pretty soon, so I am currently contacting Amazon to get this issue resolved. I will update this review soon.If any of you have experienced similar issues, please comment. Thanks.Update on Nov 18, 2011:Amazon just sent me an email saying they are sending me a replacement unit.

We quickly replaced it with a small 27\" RCA LCD TV, that was meant to be temporary. 4 long years later, I finally said \"That's it. I will not be watching another Super Bowl on this tiny TV.\" We had been shopping around, and actually I almost bought the HX820 on Cyber Monday 2011. Looking back, I should have because it was priced at $1750. So I kept an eye on it because we decided on the Sony, but I was trying to be frugal (read \"cheap\") and get closer to the 1.75K price. No deal; it was ranging from 2100 to 2400 consistently, even after Christmas. So the week of Super Bowl, I finally bit for a not unreasonable price of $1999 on Amazon Prime (free shipping/returns/low price guarantee). The TV was delivered February 4th, the day before Super Bowl. Talk about cutting it close! Anyway, the polite but not friendly, 2-man crew delivered and set it up in a matter of minutes. The TV itself is a 55\" beauty to behold. Like the title says, it is sleek, slim, and very slick. (The slurpee was just because I'm jonesin for one) I am very happy with the Sony BRAVIA KDL55HX820 55-Inch 1080p 3D LED HDTV with Built-In Wi-Fi, Black. I am no technophile, just an ordinary TV viewer, but I am loving this TV. A week after installation, we got AT&T; U-verse and now all we watch are digital channels, and blu-ray discs. The picture is amazing. 3D watching is great. We bought a 3D bundle pack with glasses and a movie (Sony 3D Bundle/Narnia Glasses) which was better priced than the glasses alone. Also purchased the Panasonic DMP-BDT220 Integrated Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player which is awesome.CONS: the tabletop stand does SEEM flimsy. I've had no problem, but the TV does seem to move more than I'd like when we bump it while dusting the console that it's on, or connecting/disconnecting cables from the back. Again, this has not been an issue, since now that everything's connected and working, I rarely have to even touch it, but it  could be more secure.

It arrived in a questionable state (dirty and somewhat nicked box), but the packaging makes was good and the panel didn't appear damaged.Turned off, the TV looked nice with the only complaint is that the stand felt flimsy and the TV tilted to one side. I was able to tighten the screws A LOT and this was no longer an issue. The TV is very thin and does not weight much. I noticed the front glass is kind of wavy, but this isn't noticeable other than looking from the side.Issue 1 - Clouding:  Immediately when I turned on the TV I noticed two white triangles in the bottom corners during any picture that had dark sides and a bright center. This was most apparent when there was white text on a black background (like movie credits, which seemed \"glowing\"). After doing research and tinkering with the settings, I found I could not get rid of this problem which is called \"clouding.\" Clouding is common with all edge-lit LED LCD TVs and is based on the panel manufacturing process. Some panels have it worse and some have it better. Doing some research, I found some have exchanged this TV many times till they got a near perfect panel. I did not want to deal with this and the white corners were too distracting for me.Issue 2 - Crease(s): On the left side (1/4 from the center) of my TV I noticed that there is a darker line about half way up the panel. This was most noticeable when viewing a solid blue picture and somewhat always noticeable during all content (if you look for it). I did research to find that this is called a \"crease\" and is common in Sony LED LCD, including its highest end model, the HX929. Further examination showed the panel had many of these, but only the one was most noticeable. Caution to all! If you start looking for these, you will find them and they will bother you! If you like LED LCD, I recommend you DO NOT look for these!Issue 3 - Disappointing 3D: Before purchase, I read and was recommended that Sony offer the best 3D compared to LG, Samsung, and Panasonic and this was one of the reasons I wanted the Sony. When I first tested the 3D, I immediately noticed a lot of \"cross-talk\" (double vision). I researched to find that Sony offers attachments to their glasses to reduce this. (see this link for more info:[...]). There is Sony support KB that claims they will send you the attachment for free and provide a number to call. I called and had to speak to someone who could hardly understand English and had no idea what they were talking about. I called again and got someone else who, after about 2 hours found what I was talking about and assured me that I would receive the attachment in 3-5 business days...that was 3 weeks ago and I never got anything. 3D overall isn't bad on this TV, but there is a lot of cross-talk, so be warned.Issue 4 - Blinking-off: At first, I thought I was imagining that the TV was blinking off randomly for a split second, but after using it more, it became apparent. Not much else to say here.Issue 5 - Slow Performance: This TV has A LOT of lag that is obvious when using the remote control and less obvious in gaming. While this seems minor, it really has a profound impact on user experience, making the TV seem worse.Issue 6 - Useless\\clunky Features: I found that in order to get the best picture quality, I had to turn off all the marketed gimmicks (smooth motion etc). It has a camera in the front that detects when something is 1 meter away and an annoying warning pops up (this can be turned off). The interface is not very intuitive and poorly designed.On a positive note: Overall, 2D picture quality is great and this gives the TV a lot of value. You can't do better with $1400 if you're looking for picture quality to price ratio to size for the 46 inch.If you found my above helpful, LED LCD may not be for you and you should consider plasma, which is the critic's choice now-a-days.

Excellent picture quality, plenty of internet content (incl. 3D samples) and many adjustable settings. As others have said, the sound isn't great but good enough for most tv shows. I also found the wireless receiver's strength to be weak - it would pause constantly streaming Pandora. I hooked it up to a wireless bridge (i.e., uses the bridge's network connection instead of the tv's) and it has been fine since. 3D quality is dependent on the source - content filmed with a 3D camera looks really good.

Picture quality is excellent on this.  I didn't have any issues with a screen crease or the gorilla glass coming undone.  I do have two complaints about this television.First is the television stand.  After setting everything up the television would lean to the right because of weight issues.  The right corner of the screen was about 1 cm from touching the furniture it was on top of.  I had to prop up the tv with some dvd cases until I received my wall mount.  This would be a huge problem for me if I wasn't going to mount the television.  Bottom line is that you are going to want to mount this on a wall.

I've tried changing channel settings on my router, different security types, static ips etc.  I am unable to get the tv to connect to my internet.

I already own a Sansung and love it too. This Sony is a beautifil TV and it has a beautiful picture even without cable.  I only used an enhanced antennae.  It is a very thin TV and can easily be mounted on a wall.  This TV is internet ready, I have viewed my pictures on it, and will soon being do more.  This TV is an entertainment center.  I look forward to the day of downloading my movies to watch and not buying DVDs.  I am all about less clutter in my home.  The only advice I have for Sony is that the sound should be better. Don't make us go out and have to buy something else to enhance the sound.

This is probably because the screen is heavier on the right side then the left and they did not take this into account when designing the stand.  I'd expect better from sony.  I believe even the 929 model uses the same stand which is ridiculous that for a $2500 tv.2)  Off angle viewing is bad.  Being on either side or top and bottom.  The stand has some sort of tilt to it,but i haven't figured out how to adjust it yet.3) it has clouding/flashlighting in both bottom corners.4) the sound is weak, but is to be expected given the screen's small size.Pros-1) colors seem accurate2) no motion blur noticed3) delivery by amazon was excellent.

It is complete a crap!People in the forums complain almost all TV-hx820 made before April, 2011 has crease.I am one of them unfortunate.Mine HX820 may be the worst one - crease, warp screen, defective stand.Shame on you - SONY!The TV's USB port cannot play mkv, divx or vxid medial files,  but cheap SONY BD player (S-480  got is $79 from Frys) with identical UI interface , it plays mkv, divx or vxid medial files.Another big issue;The Dolby Digital 5.1 or 7.1 surround sounds (from BD/DVD player) cannot pass through the TV (via HDMI ARC or Optical link to receiver); it converts to 2-channel sounds to ARC/Optical output.Shamed on SONY! You pay more to get less!Also, any online content, you need register on SONY website to be able to use. If You want to see Netflix  - you have to register on SONY first.

This go-round, I was specifically waiting for an full-array local dimming LCD television.  Some years (3 or 4?) back Sony introduced an XBR model that fit the bill, but was extremely expensive.  At the time, I assumed that the very next year, Sony would drive full-array local dimming down into more mainstream (read: affordable) models.  That was not to be: the next year the entire Sony LCD line was back to fluorescent backlighting.Fast forward to CES 2011, where Sony introduced the XBR HX929 models.  At long last, full-array local dimming was back.  I was lucky enough to attend CES in January, so I had a chance to see the HX929 and new models from all of the majors.  While the top-end models from all of the majors feature local dimming, I was surprised that they were all edge-lit rather than full-array.  The edge-lit models are amazingly thin (some only 1 cm thick) ... but seriously, the 2\" thickness of the HX929 doesn't present any issues I can imagine.My primary decision factor is picture quality, and I am pleased to report that the HX929 is stellar.  The contrast is jaw-dropping as are the colors.  I have not used the 3D option, but I can say that the 2D picture quality is the best I've seen from any LCD.  Indeed, this is as close to the picture quality of the benchmark Pioneer Kuro plasma as I have seen from any LCD.The Internet features work well.  The user interface is modern, clean and easy-to-use.  Streaming Netflix and Amazon work great and the GUIs are far more up-to-date than on my TiVO HD.In summary, the HX929 was well worth waiting for.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "IT BROKE DOWN ONE WEEK AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED", "Author": "Greg Powers", "ReviewID": "R1RXQF9Z7QPPV7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As the other reviews demonstrate the TV works fine.
