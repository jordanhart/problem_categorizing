I don't know all the technical details about color and ratios and such, but we have been pleased with it.When it arrived, it worked for about 5 minutes and then quit.  Amazon sent out a replacement right away and also paid for return shipping (UPS came to the house and picked it up).  You can't ask for better customer service than that!  I would recommend this item to anyone.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Bang for the buck", "Author": "Mapster \"Mapster\"", "ReviewID": "R1HWU17MAITG88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its an older type of TV but i dont mind, for the price its worth it!", "Date": "October 20, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Real Flat picture tube technology brings you lifelike images", "Name": "Philips 24PT6341 24\" Real Flat Stereo Tv", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41D9PPH46EL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0009PUVG4"}}
