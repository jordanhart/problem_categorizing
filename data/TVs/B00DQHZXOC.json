{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Right Size, The Right Smart HDTV!", "Author": "Alexander Tsui", "ReviewID": "R2VOVO3I4UB3LK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly, I'd like to start off the review with thanks from Amazon.com for the lightning deal. Practically, this was bought for a steal! If anyone wanted a Smart TV this holiday season, this would have been the right offer for them! Now, onward to the review.I have so much praise, but I have a wee bit of function-related negative comments about this TV. I'll begin with the positives.Clear, fluid, vivid, and producing rich colour and picture quality with the TruMotion feature always makes a win into my satisfaction! Transforming every little bit of what my Cable provider (Cablevision) pushes into my TV into impressive HD picture quality, I'm glad I made the switch from a 40\" HDTV which name isn't as great as its name (and I won't slander the company in any way.)Yes, there are so many useful apps built in and several more listed in the LG app store. At least it won't be the \"same old thing every time.\" The built-in apps, of which YouTube and the browser I use the most, definitely increase the usefulness of the TV and worth of other services like Amazon's very own Prime Instant Video! (Now it's worth it to be a prime member, eh?)So there were just three not-so-top things that concerned me, but it doesn't de-value of the product. One of them is simply browser lags and bugs with the cursor. Sometimes, if the latency becomes high enough while scrolling up or down, the pointer might go away until you restart the browser. Keeping in mind about the browser, you might be better off navigating with a USB Keyboard and a USB-Ethernet Extender because, for one, it can be a little annoying to control a Smart TV browser with a remote and you don't want to be so close to the screen to cause eye damage.) Finally, the LG app store doesn't seem like there are going to be a lot of updates coming along in favour for the LG Smart TV powered by Google TV (because, as we all know, the Google Play Store is ever-expanding and LG only makes it bigger.)So whether you see a lightning deal like this again or if you're just out there for a new Smart HDTV, this one makes the cut and shouldn't disappoint you. Great LG quality, great price... just don't rely on it as your gigantic smartphone and browser!P.S.: Haven't tested out Skype on it yet. Need to buy the LG-made camera. Only one other downside, but not necessarily a bad one.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent picture, easy setup", "Author": "mervenmar", "ReviewID": "R2802HHGYRBSMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased the 60 inch version of this in a retail store. It is an excellent picture which is comparable to my last TV, a Samsung plasma. The menu options are super easy to navigate, and it *does* work for Amazon prime streaming video. Purchased it in early November and immediately did a wireless firmware update. The wireless receiver must be decent because our DSL modem/router is on another floor. The difference between 5600 and 5700 model is that 5600 60\" is compatible with the magic remote but does not come with it; the 5700 does. As far as I can determine from spec sheet and talking to customer support the specs are otherwise the same. You will want to get/use a wireless or USB keyboard for typing in url's and doing searches in the Smart TV functions-- of course you can use the built in on screen keyboard but navigation is slow. Cable setup effortless, same for DVD player. I called support with a question twice and was connected quickly to polite competent people. Overall very happy with this TV.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Couldn't Be Happier", "Author": "Adam C Kuykendall", "ReviewID": "R3LLG88YNZQWRC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a great deal of research on various LED-LCD and Plasma TV's by several different brands found at a number of retailers but nothing came remotely close to the deal I landed through Amazon.On the research side, I used Consumer Reports and CNET as my primary resources, salt-n-peppered with a few other randomly found online sites supplemented by loads of consumer reviews found through Google.  The long and short of it comes down to this simple fact, you can spend anywhere between (for a 55\" TV) $600* and $1200 and in essence you're not getting anything more for your money.  To see any significant and/or noticeable difference in image quality from this price range you have to double what you're spending.  But if this is the range you want to keep your spending limited to, you can find a perfect match for your tastes I'm sure.(*I scored with a Black Friday deal at $750 that ended up doing a Lighting Deal that brought the price down to $600.)From my research in this price range I found that LG and Samsung ran neck and neck, with Vizio hanging on in the proverbial third place.  I was angling toward the Vizio until I went and saw several models displayed at a local retailer.  The image just didn't hold up and tended to have very jagged edges along anything that cut across the diagonal of the picture, in addition to a faint pixelated halo around people and moving objects.  The Samsungs were great, but in the 55\" dimension they tended to be more expensive.  The LG models had more variety in their TV offerings and thus lead me to this particular model the LN5600.The LG models (pardon the expression) rearrange the deck chairs to give the consumer more affordable options.  Which translates into; if you're more concerned with refresh rates over applications, or connectivity over ability, etc. then you can probably find the TV that best matches your needs or wants.I wasn't interested in 3D, and I'm not a fan of \"TruMotion\" aka 120hz refresh rate, so all I wanted was a 55\" TV that looked great without the extras.  The LN5600 is so much more than that.  The 60hz refresh rate (standard since the first TV, for the most part) looks plenty good to me.  The more action that hits the screen the more the 60hz is taxed to its limits and thus the image starts to go ever so slightly muddy.  Again, if I were paying almost $1200 and up this would be unacceptable but for $600 it's amazingly good.  Even at $750 or $800 this would be a good deal.I looked at the LN5400 and LN5700 and they were great TV's but they had features I just wasn't interested in, and at $800 and $1000 it would have been wasted money.  Especially once I found the LN5600 at $750.  I was never able to find a display model to make my final judgment and eventually just had to take a leap of faith, knowing I could still return it if I wasn't happy with it once it arrived.  Based on what I saw of the two bookend models I figured the image quality had to be in the same ballpark.Side note:  If you're concerned about sound, there are no TV's out there with phenomenal sound (again in this price range).  If sound is your concern, you inevitably already have an external stereo system that takes over for most of your audio needs and this is where you should expect all your TV audio to go through for quality output.  The LN5600 does fine, but I'd hate it if it was my only option.This TV is fine for light or dark rooms.  The screen does have a reflective glare but is a soft matte glare that isn't too over bearing.  If you've got a light source, like a floor lamp that's in the direct line of vision of the TV, you're probably going to see it in the screen.  If it's far enough off to the side, or above the screen you should be fine.The TV arrived and I've had it now for almost a month and it continues to satisfy.  Videos played on Blu-ray look fantastic, and depending on your broadband and server HD videos can come through looking equally wonderful.  Some have found the menu options on the SmartTV to be a tad awkward but I've had no problems with them.  If anything they work better than my Sony player has.If you can find this model for $600, you'll be doing great.  If you find it for $750, you're still ahead of the game.Decide what it is that you really need from your TV, and you might find that this model fits the bill.  Even if it doesn't, this example should show to you that you shouldn't be spending anymore than you have to get a great TV.  $800 at the most is what you should be shelling out.  Anything more than that (unless you're getting specific features you really, really want) is wasted money.  If you're going to spend big, then go all the way.  Just remember though, whatever you're paying $1500 for now will more than likely be $750 to $800 in the next year or two.I did the research and read the reviews out there, and when I made my choice I was thoroughly satisfied.And I couldn't be happier.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good, snappy, low-budget smart TV.  Has many of the popular apps, but is overall lacking in that department.", "Author": "N", "ReviewID": "R3CU312QEGRQAZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary:  Good, basic smart TV with generally good picture quality and sufficiently even backlighting.What it is:  50 inch 1080p 60Hz smart TV by LG.Pros:  Bargain for what you get for $450 (sale price).  Netflix works flawlessly.  Capability of using \"magic remote,\" which I assume is their fancy name for universal TV remote (e.g. Logitech Harmony).  Vibrant color and good viewing angle, as well as pretty even backlighting.  60Hz means you won't have \"soap opera effect\" on movies.  Low input lag for playing games.Cons:  Only 60Hz, so it has some motion blurs in sports and fast action scenes.  Magic remote capability was kind of annoying, as it asks you to set it up on initial setup yet the TV set doesn't come with one.  Heavy, but I can only assume non-LED and plasma sets would only be heavier.  Grab a friend when setting this up. As it's a budget model, LED lights are pretty far apart and it shows (more apparent if viewing from an angle).  Slight fade on corner of TV.  Doesn't have apps that competing Samsung smart TVs have (no Plex? No Crunchyroll?) and ones that do (Netflix) seems slower.  Had to run firmware update twice before using it in earnest.Other comments:  has 3 HDMI ports, contrary to what Amazon says.  Use \"game mode\" when playing games on it.  Should be compatible with Roku stick, but haven't checked (I have no Roku stick.)  TV became noticeably slower after firmware updates... hmm.  Older LG sets had plain white LG logo up front; now the logo is magenta, which looks cheap on a TV.  Also note that LG smart TVs may transmit your personal data to their server, although they noted that they'll send an update to address that.  Haven't checked for input lag over analog channels (component, composite)Conclusion:  Very good bargain at $450; not so sure for $650.  Get this for TV functionality, not smart TV apps.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy and Great TV", "Author": "Bob Page \"book geek\"", "ReviewID": "R13SCCESAOJSMG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this a month ago (60\" SmartTV version) and haven't regretted anything about it. Picture is perfect if the source video is perfect. We were disappointed with what we now know is the TruMotion \"feature\". So if you fire up the tv right out of the box be warned that you will see this \"tv camera\" sort of look to the picture until you find the TruMotion setting and turn it off. We decided to leave it on but change this setting to very low.As with many tv's the speakers in the unit give a mediocre sound. We run sound through an optical cable to a Sony multimedia sound system so this didn't matter to us. Netflix and Amazon Prime work flawlessly. I've had 4 or 5 updates since I bought it (one just yesterday) and everything still works fine. The newer Netflix interface showed up yesterday and looks nice as well as functions good. Once in a while there is audio delay but there is a setting for that so you are not without a solution.I would buy the same unit again.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Liking my new 55-inch LG", "Author": "Another Floyd", "ReviewID": "RSO9AEOMI0WJ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a preliminary review. I'm posting now to maybe help out new LG smart TV owners that have had the same trouble as me -- getting the LG Smart World app source to function. I did manage to create an LG Smart World account (the password must have a number or two in it, although that is not explicitly stated). And, I had used my broadband to update the system.The premium apps like Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc. are pre-installed. But, upon repeated attempts over 2 days to add the Pandora app from LG Smart World, I kept getting \"Server Disconnected\" errors. Fortunately, I did find a post on the net to point me in the right direction: You need to manually add a DNS server to the network setup, and it will work. Go into Network settings and, hit Start Connection, and maybe one more button click, select the poorly titled Other Networks. Select the network you are using (I had wifi and wired to choose from), then the button for manual config, and the tab for manual DNS. Put in a working DNS number. You may want to use Google's 8.8.8.8, since it's easy to remember, and reliable. Click out of there, and you're set.I've had my TV for a couple of days. It's my new living room computer monitor, as well as TV. I'm still getting used to the colors and picture settings, which is mainly what I'm reserving judgement on. This TV replaces a 5 or 6-year old Vizio 42 incher that's being demoted to bedroom use. I have noted that the LG 55 weighs within a pound of the Vizio 42. I have also noted that the LG uses a good bit less energy: 160 watts, vs the Vizio's 280 watts.I found the smart features to be pretty decent, but, not fully tested in absence of appropriately fast broadband. There's a web browser that's a bit clunky, but does work, for web surfing. And, you can watch TV in a moveable window, while you surf. I've got a wireless USB keyboard w/trackpad that made for pretty good operation.The remote, menus and overall user experience are all good. Initial setup was as quick as can be expected. The menus and channels change quickly. When you power on, you're watching TV in 7 or 8 seconds.-----I've gotten used to all of the settings on my TV. Most jarring to me and most others is the TruMotion setting (under Picture Option for each of the Picture modes). Heh, I thought I was watching a movie that was produced by hacks, when it was the TruMotion causing the \"soap opera effect.\" Fortunately, the TV tuner and each of the HDMI inputs can be set up with different preferences, and it will remember them. For the DVD, I turned TruMotion off. I leave it off for TV, except when watching sports, then I turn it up higher than the default, to help make up for the slowish 60Hz refresh rate. For the PC, TruMotion is  disabled by LG. Note that, if you fiddle with the settings for a particular input, and wish to reset them to default, you wind up resetting ALL settings for all inputs. I was getting frustrated by this, but finally figured out what was happening.One of the things I used most on my old Vizio was the Picture-in-Picture setting, where I could watch TV while using my computer. Since TVs no longer come with PIP capability, I got a Hauppauge USB tuner for my PC, to pick up over-the-air channels. I can watch TV in a window, or full-screen. Now, I only use the TV's tuner when watching sports, because the TV has TruMotion, and other settings that provide a more vibrant picture than my PC's tuner does (due to me having the contrast and brightness muted for longterm computer use).One thing missing when selecting inputs, is that you can not individually specify where sound will be output for the TV tuner and each of the HDMI inputs. You only have one place to select sound output, which is applied to all. It's fiddly when I had to change this, when going from PC mode (sound out to TV speakers), to DVD (sound out to home theater receiver). I finally realized that I could connect the DVD player directly to the receiver with a digital audio cable, and leave the TV out of the sound loop, for DVD viewing. Now, I just leave the TV's sound output to the TV speakers.I'd give this TV 4.5 stars, if possible.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value, thin bezel", "Author": "Brett", "ReviewID": "R3JKXY75PYS96Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great value for a TV of this size and quality.. the bezel is nice and thin - this was a great replacement for a 3 yr old LG 47\" TV in my master bedroom.. the physical size of this was the same as my old 47\" because of how thin this new bezel is.Unfortunately, the shipping company which Amazon used did not come anywhere near the guaranteed delivery date, so I had to cancel this order and buy it locally.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "For $999, you can't beat it (60\" TV).", "Author": "P.

I had to return it because the remote didn't work which meant none of the Smart TV apps worked either (the remote issue is a big problem with Vizio TVs). Also, the picture quality on the Vizio was not that good. So I decided to downgrade to a 60\" TV and got the LG 60LN5600. The LG picture is superior to the Vizio even though the Vizio has 240hz and was supposed to be their top of the line brand while the LG only has 120hz and this model is not their top of the line brand. The LG's picture calibration settings really let you fine tune the picture to your exact liking, something the Vizio TV lacked.I mean for $999, you can't beat this TV for a 60\" size. You get a model that was just released in late 2013, a SmartTV with all the important apps and most importantly, great picture quality.

LG was a good decision. For 1/3 less the cost, the LG brought us a picture that I find better than the Sony's in some cases, worse in others. The LG's picture color contrast appears more defined to me, while the sharpness / focus of images less. The little less sharpness / focus would not have been at all noticeable if the two sets had not been running side by side at one point. The LG also weighs noticeably less.

I bought this unit at Best Buy two days after Christmas.  All was well for exactly four weeks.  Good picture, smart tv features worked well, no complaints.  Then while watching the morning news with my first cup of coffee in hand the tv just cut itself off like someone pushed the power button.That morning news program was the last thing I ever saw on this tv.  When I tried to power it up again it hung on the \"LG Life's Good\" boot screen.  This screen which only stayed on for 3 or 4 seconds would stay up for more than a minute and then there would be no picture.  Unplugging power and hdmi cables did nothing.  Since I had only had the tv four weeks I called Best Buy hoping they might do a good will exchange even though their return policy cuts return time to 15 days.  They did agree to take back the tv on an exchange and I came home with a 60\" non-smart Samsung LED.I rate it two stars because it was a nice unit and worked well, but only for a short time.

I've had it for a week now.PROS:-The Smart TV features on this set are AWESOME. I thought I wouldn't even use these features as I already have a BD player with Smart features, as well as a Wii U that does all that. This TV trumps all those by being WAY faster (I assume due to the dual core processor) than both of them. The picture on Netflix is 1080p and the sound is Dolby 5.1. Awesome.-The image looks really good. Obviously, there's a difference between the picture on this set and the same size LG that costs double the amount with 4K. It looks better than my Aquos did though, which says something because I really liked the Sharp. I can see details that I didn't see before!-The way the set detects inputs is great. There's also plenty of inputs provided. If you need composite OR component in addition to HDMI, this set has it, which is good if you want to hook up something like an old school Nintendo, SNES, N64, or something like that.-The lines on the design are great. It is a really nice looking set that doesn't weigh nearly as much as my 5-year old Aquos did.CONS:-The major con about this set is unequivocally the sound. I don't expect 2 small television speakers to sound like my main surround sound system, but the audio on this television set is absolutely unacceptable. Compared to my Sharp Aquos, the audio is paper thin, with no ability (and I mean \"NO ABILITY\") to reproduce anything below 400Hz. I'm not looking for a TV to rumble the floors, but you can't even hear the bass drum of a drum set on this television. Know this: if you buy this set, you will have to hook it up to an alternate audio system. That's what I did, and now I'm happy...-The set is only 60Hz. If you watch a fast moving scene, you can tell. I'd love to see a side-by-side comparison of 60Hz vs 240 Clear Motion Rate, but there is a bit of blurring that happens at 60Hz, and not just on football.-no 3D. I don't really care about this, but would be nice to have if movies end up moving more in this direction.No matter what any other review says, you CAN turn off the TruMotion feature (the soap opera de-juddering). It's very simple. Hit \"Settings\" -> \"Picture\" -> \"Picture Settings.\" It's in that menu. You can turn it down, or turn it off altogether.TAKEAWAY: a really nice set for the price. I paid $650 for mine, and probably wouldn't pay much more for it. If you're okay hooking your set up to an alternate audio source (like a soundbar or a full-fledged home theater reciever), the features and image look really good! It's not 4K or 3D, but it's also not $1,500.

A lot of picture settings to adjust the picture to your heart\u2019s content. Just don\u2019t expect plasma-like picture quality (mostly black levels) in darkened rooms.Pros- Picture settings galore. I can\u2019t imagine needing more picture settings than this thing has.- Bright. At least for me, especially coming from a plasma.- Great for daytime viewing (sure beats the plasma).- Nice looking.- Lightweight. 55lbs compared to the plasma\u2019s (only 50\u201d) 88lbs.- Backlit instead of edge lit.- Plenty of USB inputs (3).- Enough HDMI inputs for me (3), one with ARC (which my current receiver does not support).- It\u2019s a smart TV. Not really something I needed though.- Way less power consumption and generated heat than that plasma. That plasma was a space heater, great for winter but not so much so for summer in the Valley of the Sun.Cons- Mostly reflective (not matte) screen. While not quite as bad as the plasma, it\u2019s close.- Point source lighting in the reflections has a rainbow effect. For example, the kitchen lights behind my viewing area can be seen as reflections with a couple of lines of rainbow extending out from each light source in the reflection. I'll try to post a user picture.- Not very many old school inputs. Just one component/composite shared. You can use one or the other but not both. Those still using several older video game systems or VCRs directly to the TV\u2019s inputs will have to find another solution like an A/V receiver.- No RCA audio out, just headphone jack (on back panel). There is an optical TOSLINK audio out, however.- Short and not too common power cord. TV is centered about eye-level for me (I\u2019m 5\u201911\u201d) and the cord just barely reaches the floor to plug into the outlet strip there so about a 5\u20196\u201d cord? The TV end is not like the usual removable power cords like on computers and other equipment so it is not as easily swapped out. I guess this is called a Mickey Mouse type power cord. It is available on Amazon, just may not be something you otherwise have extras or longer ones of stuffed in a drawer somewhere. Depending on your installation you may need a longer version of this cord or a three pronged extension cord.- Printed manual is very brief. There is more detail in the \u201cmanual\u201d built into the TV as a sort of user help system.First some perspective. I\u2019ve been a plasma owner since 2005. First a 50\u201d Toshiba 50HP95, then a 50\u201d Panasonic TH-50PZ800U acquired 5.5 years ago. My desire to upgrade was purely to increase viewable picture area. We are pretty big movie buffs and  watch mostly blu-rays and cable based HD DVR recorded movies through a Pioneer VSX-1018AH A/V Receiver (we do not use the TV speakers). No over the air broadcasts. We usually watch at night, in a dark room, with only some LED ambient light sticks mounted behind the TV and occasional day time use. Our viewing room (our family room) has the TV mounted on the wall with an open viewing space with windows and a kitchen behind the viewing area. Mostly, I am biding my time until the 60\u201d \u2013 70\u201d OLED TVs (flat hopefully, not the curved ones)  are within my price range. Hopefully, in 5 years or so. Until then, this will do.Picture QualityI wouldn\u2019t consider myself a snob but I do want the picture to look nice to my eyes in a darkened room. There are enough picture adjustments on this TV to get a pretty decent picture in that dark room. But I do miss the black levels of even the older plasma I had. Except for the black levels in these viewing conditions, I am otherwise pretty happy with it. The LG definitely beats out the plasma in daylight viewing conditions with its brightness able to overcome most of the reflections you might otherwise see in this relatively reflective screen. It is reflective, not matte. With the TV turned off I can clearly see myself and the room reflected in the screen. I would have preferred a matte screen for those times when we are viewing during the day, but generally that type of viewing is usually sports related and doesn\u2019t have too many darker scenes to show the reflections. The matte screens seem to be harder and harder to find and I can\u2019t be too picky at this price point. Otherwise, to my eyes, the picture is on par with the plasma as far as color accuracy and other picture parameters. I don\u2019t think I am real picky beyond black levels. I turned all the motion enhancing stuff off right away. Have never liked that effect. Maybe someday. But I\u2019m still old school as far as that goes. I\u2019ve watched sports (football and basketball) and a variety of other programming and I honestly can\u2019t complain about any LCD related motion resolution effects as I didn\u2019t notice them. I may not be real sensitive to it, but I can see those kind of effects in an older 42\u201d Vizio LCD (not LED) in my den, so I am not totally immune to them. Picture uniformity seems adequate. Although the viewing angle seems pretty good there is a slight shift of black levels on the left side of the TV when sitting on the right side of a centered 96\u201d couch from about 8 feet away. A lot of people may not notice, but I do. Colors don\u2019t seem to shift as much as the black level does with viewing angle. The viewing angle is not going to match the plasma but I knew that going in with LED/LCD technology. That is why I am making do until I can afford OLED. Apparently there is no local dimming with this set which is to be expected based on the price. I do notice that the screen is very black when the scene is totally black and the backlight turns off. But when that totally black scene has even a very small speck of white light (think flashlight in an otherwise totally dark night scene), the backlight turns on and the black level gets more grey. This can be seen in the black level of the letter bars when watching wide aspect ratio movies.SoundI don\u2019t use the TV speakers. I did try them while I had it temporarily set up on a stand to try out before hanging it on the wall. Can\u2019t say much for the sound. Not much bass and it did sound like sound coming from behind a TV, i.e. it is there but not great. The speakers are mounted in a thicker part of the set at the bottom of the TV and fire down and/or behind the TV. There are definitely speaker grills on the bottom of the speaker enclosures and I thought I felt speaker grills behind the speaker enclosures as well when I was mounting it on the wall (I didn\u2019t notice before it was hung). Either way, it didn\u2019t sound great and unless that is what you are limited to or used to, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. There is a setting in the TV for Wall Mount or Stand for sound that I did not try out.Form Factor/Visual AppealNice looking set to me. Bezel is not super small but much smaller than my plasma. The set is not super sexy skinny like most of the edge lit LEDS. Most of the set is 2.5\u201d thick. At the bottom the speaker enclosure area is thicker at about 3.5\u201d. The TV mounted controls may be inconveniently placed depending on your setup. They are behind the TV on the right-hand side. The control markings are behind the set as well, so unless you memorize the order of the controls, you may be fumbling around quite a bit. I would imagine most people are going to be using the remote anyways, so not a big deal in my book.Smart TV stuffI haven\u2019t used smart TV stuff before. None of my previous sets were smart. I did set up the Ethernet connection (wired, I did not try the wireless). I do have Amazon Prime and I did activate this TV for that and started to watch Skyfall and was impressed with the HD picture quality and the sound was nice 5.1 via the optical TOSLINK back to my A/V receiver. For the 15 or 20 minutes I watched, I saw no buffering, stuttering or pixilation. The movies seemed to start pretty much instantly. I have Cox 20MBS internet so maybe that helps. I tried out Pandora and that worked fine. There are others like Netflix, Hulu Plus, CinemaNow, Vimeo,YouTube, etc. that I did not try. One negative seems to be that you are locked out of adjusting picture settings when using Amazon Prime at a minimum (I didn\u2019t try any more than that). It seems to allow you to select either the Game or Cinema setting but you can\u2019t click on Settings on the remote and make changes. Guess you have to make you settings changes prior to entering Smart mode? I think I saw one review complaining that the Motion Enhancement can\u2019t be disabled using Amazon Prime but I think you can as long as either your Cinema or Game setting has it disabled (and the game setting may have it disabled by default, I didn\u2019t check that). I didn\u2019t play around with this too much so I\u2019m not 100% sure about all that. The TV supports DLNA and I did play a couple songs from my PC (Windows 7, MS Media Player) and it showed album cover artwork for those songs that had it. Not the greatest interface in the world for selecting songs to play but I don\u2019t expect to really use this feature much, if at all, anyways. Or most of the smart features for that matter. There is a web browser that I only tried for a second. As soon as I had to type something into the browser with the remote, I quit. Too painful and I have a PC for my web browsing so it is not something I expect to use.OtherI like the shape and feel of the remote (the non Magic Touch remote, the Magic Touch does not come with this TV). I have a Harmony One that will be used most of the time, but I did use the LG extensively during setup. I thought the buttons where well placed and had enough variety in terms of shape and feel to allow you to find your way around in the dark. It is not back-lit even though a lot of the buttons are translucent and look like they could be back-lit. Not a huge deal for me since I use the Harmony One, although I don\u2019t understand why the manufacturers can\u2019t backlight the remotes. It is more the exception than the rule and it really shouldn\u2019t be that way. I did like the way the picture changes (behind/around the pop-up menus) as you cursor through various picture setting options prior to actually selecting the setting. This allows you to see what it will look like if you do choose that setting (for instance cursoring through Cinema, Game, User, Vivid, etc. the picture behind/around the menus will show the effects of that setting prior to selecting/enabling that setting).Final ThoughtsSo far I am mostly happy with this set for my intended use. Great for daytime or lighted room viewing. Sports and such look awesome to my eyes.  It will do for subdued lighting/darkened  viewing until I can afford the next great technology: OLED.

The new LG was our family's Christmas present and we have been very pleased with it so far.TV set-up was much easier than I anticipated.  Just followed the directions and it worked fine, and we were up and running in about half an hour.  Didn't need any fine tuning.  Since we do not have cable or satellite dish and hence, no TV channels, it was even more simple.  The Smart TV feature connected with our WIFI and we immediately began streaming.The picture is clear and much more crisp than our  4 year old Vizio, which we were quite happy with until it died.  Sound is clear and has a better volume range and tone too. A 50 inch TV is pretty big but it was no problem for the 2 of us to get it out of the box and on the stand.  The remote handles easily and came with its own batteries. I have no complaints at all.  Its a great TV!

Motion blur was just too noticeable.This may be due to this tv being 60Hz.For being 60 Hz TV, I also noticed Soap Opera Effect. This is where movies and TV shows looked as if I was watching a daytime Soap Opera.They just looked as if I was watching some production on a cheap set.It was just so horrible that I couldn't concentrate on what I was watching.I did try changing the settings to no avail.Audio was also slightly out of synch when watching cable through the cable box.Adjusting audio settings helped, but was still noticeable.These were non issues with my older 50 inch plasma TV.Online search on these issues show that motion blur and SOE (Soap Opera Effect) are issues with LED-LCD TVs. If I had known these issues, I would not have ordered this TV in the first place. This may not be a deal breaker for everyone, but for me it was just too distracting.Smart TV was nice, but cannot make up for horrible viewing experience.This TV (or this type of TV) is ideal for bright rooms or if you view TV in daylight as long as above issues are not important.As for me, after doing some careful research, I am looking to get a plasma TV (probably Panasonic. Panasonic unfortunately is getting out of the Plasma TV market). Plasma TV seems to offer better picture quality than LED-LCD TV while sacrificing some other attributes to LED-LCD TV.

TV insists that the latest updates are installed.  Works great for Netflix... But sadly it's currently a total no-go with Amazon Instant Video.  I got this this because the description promised this feature would work.  Please fix this LG/Amazon!If this issue is fixed this TV is certainly a four star unit (and maybe five). If you don't care about Amazon Instant Videos this is a very nice 60 hz 50\" LED Smart TV.  I only rated it so harshly because Prime Videos were a major deciding factor for me personally. I will be sure to re-rate & give props in this review as soon as this works!UPDATES BELOW!This issue has been resolved & this is a 4.5 or 5 star TV for sure now.  I'm saying 5 stars just to make up for having it at 2 stars previously.Out of the box, whenever I launched Amazon Prime Video it told me that the TV must update, and when I tried to update the TV it would tell me I had the latest software... it was a vicious loop that prevented me from enjoying Amazon Prime.The fix for me was doing a factory reset of the TV. After the factory reset I had the TV check for updates again. This time it was able successfully got the latest updates an Amazon Prime has worked fine ever since. So out of the box my TV could not update but a factory reset totally resolved this issue.Another minor (personal preference) issue I ran into is that there was a motion-smoothing feature enabled by default (I believe it was called TruMotion).  It made all of my programming seem (to me) to scroll unnaturally smoothly (I have seen others refer to this as a \"soap opera\" effect).  It was a bit unsettling for me (maybe I just need to get used to it).  I decided to disable it for now rather than try to get used to it.  In the TV settings menu this feature has several levels (it was enabled by default).  I turned it to off or zero & it now seems like the \"normal\" TVs I have been watching all of my life.  I just thought I would mention this in case anyone else doesn't like this experience & wasn't sure what the cause was.This TV is a great choice for anyone happy with a 55\" 60-Hz TV who wants some \"smart\" features for a very reasonable price.

At first the show would stop, then I would leave the ap and come back, the show would run for a little while, but then it would stop again.  I complained to Hulu and they blamed my internet, when I told them I had 30 mbs per second, they blamed my cache.  None of my other aps had issues, Netflix ran fine, Amazon ran fine, Crackle ran fine.  Hulu finally fix the problem...or so I thought.  Now, the ap just stops working and brings you back to the main screen in the middle of show.  When I go back into start again the show is about 5-10 minutes behind where I was.  I wish I had known that this was going to be such a problem.  I wouldn't have spent the extra money on a smart TV.
