{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing TV for the price and size!", "Author": "Hypnosis4U2NV", "ReviewID": "R1R3I0M1LB4HA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the WD-65738 for over a week now and I have to say that I am pleased with the overall picture quality of the set. Its definitely a big improvement over my older Sony 65\" rear projection CRT.Pros:1) The price for its size as I was able to grab this for under $1500. I was not looking for anything wall mountable but was amazed at how deep it is for a rear projection, only 18 inches and it weighs 70 lbs! Quite the improvement over my other set which was almost 3 feet deep and weighed 330lbs!2) Current technologies like StreamTV, 6-Color Processor, HDMI w/CEC, HDMI-PC Compatibility, 3D DLP Link, Game Mode, Smooth120, EdgeEnhance, and DeepField Imager.3) I find the speakers are more than adequate for regular TV viewing. They are loud and are no worse than speakers found on older tube CRT sets. It does have a digital audio out connection so that you can connect to a receiver and process the sound for whatever your currently watching on the set.4) Advanced video calibration menu. What makes this so unique from other sets is that you do not have to go into a specialized service menu for your TV to make advanced video changes to settings. The big plus is that anyone can tinker with this without fear of being unable to revert back to the default settings because you can reset ANY settings you made back to default. The set offers 3 video settings, Natural, Bright and Brilliant. I found Brilliant to be excessively bright and bluish looking. Bright seemed fine if you have the set in a bright room with lots of sunlight. Natural was the setting of my choice and I tweaked the settings for my particular tastes. I was also able to play with the ADV video option and got the set looking even better than those 3 settings.5) The projection bulb on these types of sets do eventually fail. At $99 for a replacement, its as easy as changing a light bulb in your house. Remove the small door panel in the rear and replace. When compared to the $600 cost of replacing one of my CRT guns on my older CRT projection set, it's a modest repair. Obviously, the more you watch TV, the more frequent you will be replacing bulbs. At 6,000 hours of expected lamp life, you should get decent mileage before having to replace the lamp. Obviously, factors such as room temperature and how well the unit stays ventilated will play a significant role in lamp life.Some Cons:1) Using the TV audio and a receiver together will produce an noticeable echo. Shouldn't be a problem so long as you mute the TV when you use your receiver.2) The Harmony One's command database for this TV is somewhat off. I was not able to use the direct input command for HDMI2 or HDMI3 using the database of IR codes that Logitech provides. There is a work around for this issue. You need to put your Mitsubishi Remote in Direct Functions Mode by pressing and holding the POWER button until it flashes red twice, then enter 0,0,0,9,0. Have your Harmony remote learn a new IR command (name it HDMI2(IR) and HDMI3(IR),) point the the remotes at each other, press INPUT button on the TV remote, and when your Harmony is ready to read the IR code for HDMI2, press the FF button on the TV remote. Repeat the steps for HDMI3 but press the PLAY button instead of FF. If you need to take the TV remote out of Direct Functions mode, hold the power button until it flashes red twice, then enter 0,0,9,3,5. Then assign the HDMI2 and HDMI3 functions on the Harmony the new IR commands for each input you just had it learn. Problem solved.3) Whenever changing video format from a source, there is a video input delay on the TV. ie - I am a Cablevision Optimum customer and whenever I go to the iO interactive guide, the set goes in and out of video with a delay (screen goes black for a few seconds). I have read reports that using a receiver to send all your sources to the TV via one HDMI cable helps.I still believe that this is the best bang for your buck if your not looking for anything wall mountable and want a TV set over 55\". For a total of $1499 on a 65\" set, its definitely the replacement I needed with 2 small boys running around the house. And I was pleasantly surprised by the picture quality when I had it up and running. The last time I looked at DLP's was when Samsung introduced the LED version of its DLP's and this set definitely looks a whole lot better than what I saw then. Picture Quality is on par with other more expensive sets and the 3D support makes this future-proof for the up-and-coming 3D technology!**Update 5/28/13**The bulb finally blew last week, making it almost 3 years on the original bulb. That's pretty amazing considering that the TV is on for pretty much 12-14 hours a day. I did order another bulb, OEM and in it's housing and it's working great. I would suggest sticking to OEM and paying a few bucks more than buying the cheaper bulbs which may go out sooner and not provide the enough lighting for your viewing pleasure.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "What A GREAT TV!!", "Author": "Charles T.

Product was quickly delivered within 5 days. Set up was a breeze and in less than 10 minutes I was  enjoying Direct TV. HD image  is vastly superior to the old Toshiba which costs twice as much back in 2001!  Factory issued remote control is of standard quality & ergonomics ( lousy).  Why can't they give us a less busy remote with  backlit lighting.  Picture adjustment is intuitively easy after you figured out the remote with its tiny buttons and letters.  Next day, I connected a Blu ray player with HDMI cable but all I see is a blue blank screen.  After trouble shooting for an hour unsuccesfully, I quit and instead used digital component cables which work fine. The image with component cables is actually very good.  The manual is not very helpful for trouble shooting this HDMI glitch so I went back to this review page and read that a previous customer had a similar problem. Sreeni V in Fremont, CA found a solution which was to  reset the tv to its default setting by pressing \"Menu\" then \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" thus allowing  the tv to recycle and  recognize the Blu ray player. Thanks Sreeni V in Fremont, CA for the tip. After performing this procedure, YES! We have Blu ray picture and it is gorgeous. Not sure why the set recognized digital component connection but not HDMI connection.  I feel so bad  for the several folks who had horrible purchase experience and thus understandably gave bad reviews of the product. This the reason why I prefer to purchase most products directly through Amazon Store and not third party vendors. Weshould not however confuse the lousy retailers with the actual operation/function of the product itself. Mitsubishi cannot control shady retailers.  Overall, this DLP 65 inch tv with its huge  performance and low price is a winner.

Once calibrated correctly the picture was amazing.  The colors were accurate the brights and darks were natural and using 1080i or 1080P content the picture had absolutely no artifacts.  Unfortunately their was a problem with the TV and a couple weeks after having it the picture would sometimes go out.  I ended up having to exchange it for the newer model WD-65738 because the WD-65737 unit had been discontinued.  The WD-65738 has really been a let down.  Even with correct calibration the colors are washed out, the picture is to bright and the darks are not accurate. There are also artifacts when watching 1080i or 1080P content.

The picture quality is excellent, and while it may be a little more bulky than some modern TVs, it is lightweight and throws less heat than my old plasma.3D Experience:I had to spend hours looking up what seemed to be basic information to be able to use 3D on this TV.First, I found out for the 3D glasses you DO NOT need an external emitter, but if you have a set of glasses with one it is compatible. What you can use are DLP Link 3D glasses which seem to be cheaper and sync themselves up to the TV.Second, this model 738 and the one above 838 now support various kinds of 3D input beyond checkerboard with a software update(mine came installed with this update).  This means you DO NOT need the external converter box (3DA-1) nor do you need to buy the start kit for $400.  I used my PS3 directly to play my 3D Blu-ray.  When I connected my PS3 to the TV it recognized it as a 3D capable TV and automatically set itself up.  After that you simply need to turn the TV's 3D mode to automatic and choose the glasses settings that match your 3D glasses.  The whole process was incredibly easy and the 3D movie experience is AMAZING!Bottom line: You cannot beat the price, picture, and ease of use of this TV!", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "John1800", "ReviewID": "R27ZRK03F0AQWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely beautiful!

We bought it for our basement which during the summer is a lot cooler place to sit and watch TV.  We had a cable outlet and hooked up the coaxial cable to the TV but were very disapointed with the so-so picture quality that our over priced cable company supplies for those who go boxless.  We have since gotten an additional cable box with a HDMI cable from our cable provider, which allows us the HI-DEF channels, and wow! what a difference.  The HI-DEF channels on this TV are as good or better than our upstairs Samsung 50\" 3D plasma and we paid almost $500 less for it.  We would recommend this Mitsubishi 65\" to anyone interested in purchasing a new TV.  You can't wall mount it and Mitsubishi really needs to offer more internet entertainment choices but that is the only negatives we have found.  The picture and sound are quite good right out of the box and not being tweek type people we are happy with what we have.  Haven't watched any 3D on it yet but we are confident it will also be outstanding.  The TV fits nicely on our old TV table with a suprisingly small footprint for a TV this large.  We paid $999 for the TV with free shipping.  Just check Ebay and you will see what an outstanding deal this is.  Shipping was 10 days.  The two delivery guys were pleasent and didn't mind hanging around while we inspected the TV before we signed off.  They also took the TV out of the box and set it on the table top.

The problems with the 725 were so numerous that Mitsubishi replaced it (store where the 725 was purchased is no longer in business) with a new 738.  Needless to say, I was pleased.  I didn't have the 738 a week and it conked out.  An optical engine had to be replaced.  Since then, with one minor exception, the set has worked well.  The 3D quality leaves a lot to be desired.  The images fade occasionally and the picture quality is substandard to regular HD.  My biggest complaint at this time is Mitsubishi not selling me an extended warranty.  At first they told me they didn't have enough experience with the Tv to quote me a price.  Now, they ignore my emails and when I call they say a higher authority will contact me within 48 hours, but no one calls.  The set will be a year old at the end of June.

Clark", "ReviewID": "R3IZ55C11SRZDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Waited 6 months after purchasing to write my review to make sure I had all the facts - here goes:AWESOME TV - INCREDIBLE picture...but some things you won't get (b/c other vendors aren't playing fair).- Avatar, Shrek 3D movies - Panasonic & Samsung KNOW you can get 3D, 1080P (so WHAT if it's DLP) at a lower price (& w/o the totally crappy sound on a Panasonic), so what do they do?  They sign exclusives for CONTENT (Avatar won't be avail. retail until AT LEAST X-Mas 2011 & Shrek comes with Samsung 3D pack).- Apple TV, which basically partnered & then killed FLOTV, hasn't decided who they're going to partner with.  Mitsubishi won't plug in the fix until they do.OTHERWISE, let's see what you DO get:- PERFECT 1080P picture.  And 1080P channels come in perfectly from DirecTV.- PERFECT 3D quality.  Mitsubishi's adapter costs $99, starter pack w 2 pairs of glasses retails $350 (cheaper than Panasonic or Samsung), but you can get this discounted (I paid, $200).  And for X-Mas 2010, Dell INCLUDED it.  It resolves any compatability issues with Blu Ray players, PS3, etc. in 3D.- VALUE - OK, so it's rear projection, meaning you're going to have to replace a bulb after 3 yrs.  Fine.  2 options for this.  Buy a 4 yr. Square Trade, which I did (specifically says it covers cost of 1 new bulb), or buy a bulb when you need one.  I saw the slot - it's pretty easy to replace (Mitsubishi should be commended for this) & rather than watch picture fade over time, once you buy a new bulb & put it in, it's like your TV is BRAND NEW again.  Seriously, I've got a friend who had an older model (2-3 yrs) & saw it with my own eyes.So, let's review - for the cost of TV ($1000) + Home Theater ($200) + stand ($200) + adapter & glasses ($200) + bulb ($100) = $1700 TOTAL, you'll get the crystal clear 1080P, 3D, home theater, etc. for a FRACTION of buying one of the other brands.I've got 2 pairs of glasses, but 3D Heaven will sell more for $50 ea.  I told my kids, just like REAL glasses, pony up some $ & keep them in your room.  I paid the up-front & will buy the Blu Rays, but the glasses are yours to keep.So far, I've watched DirecTV movies, Disney's Christmas Carol thru my kid's PS3, a Lakers-Suns game, Buddy Guy doing a concert & Mon. night the BCS Championship game.Face it - like color TV - it's where this thing is going.  So AT SOME POINT, you'll want to get in.If you're going to go NOW, go at lowest cost.  If not, wait for cost to come down.

I bought this tv sceptical of buying a rptv based on picture quality but after having it for a month i have to say the picture is just as good if not better (better in my opinion) than the way over priced 55\" plasmas led and lcd screens and as far as the 3d content is concerned it blows eveything on the market out of the water. 3d is an emersive experiance and can only be done right on a huge screen like what u get with a mits. The best thing to me about the 3d (which is why i bought this tv) is u have just as good of a picture no matter where u are sitting which lets 5 to 6 people  watch a 3d movie comfortably u dont have to be directly n front of the tv like all the other displays on the market. The best way to test this is to find a really good scene that comes out 50% or more pause the movie and walk around your room and u can watch the image follow u around the room. People u have to understand dlp has been doing 3d for years and all the big screens in the states like the cowboys screen the new screen at the charollet motor speedway and all your new digital movie theaters that play new 3d movie are all dlp what more do u want. Yes eventually i will have  to buy a bulb but who cares with the money i saved buying this tv as opposed to buying a more expensive smaller and overated plasma led or lcd i will gladly poney up a hundred bucks every 2 or 3 years and laugh when the neighbors buy a more expensive 46\" lcd that dosent even compare to a mits.

Just as clear as any plasma or LED tv. I haven't had any mechanical problems with this tv other than with the changing of inputs. After playingn a video game or Blu-Ray DVD, then going back to my cable TV input, it (once in a blue moon) does a quick blackout like it's changing inputs. IF this happens, all I do is cycle through the inputs and then go back to cable input and everything is fine. The only other noticable thing I have noticed is that if you pay too close attention (and the TV has been on for hours - or is warming up) you can notice a slight white flicker perhaps from the bulb being too hot. This has come & gone from time to time but is not overly bothersome really at all cause I\"mbasically the only one that has noticed it. But, I have kept this TV on for hours and hours (sometimes 14hours a day) and no problems, had it for over a year now and the bulbs are still fine I haven't had to replace them yet.One thing I have done (being cautious) is when I first had the TV placed where I wanted it, I did move it atleast a foot away from the wall making sure to get air to the back of the TV to prevent it from overheating the bulbs. Plus I also put a nice size fan in the back of the tv too help keep it cool. If you can get your air conditioning aimed towards the bulbs eventhe better as I'm sure they would last much longer. The bulbs do get hot in the back of the tv, but not hot enough to effect room temerature.The other feature I like about this tv is, if the bulbs do get too warm (from TV being on hours & hours without being turned off), the tv has a warning light and it will shut off automatically too let the bubls cool down. This has only happened ONLY ONCE since I owned this tv and I had it oh easily longer than 24hrs. on a hot summer day. Not a good idea to do too often.I can't comment on the audio part because from other reviews I automatically heard that the TV sound on this tv is not so great so I've had it on mute to reduce noise reduction and just use my home stereo theater system.All in all, GREAT TV for the price that can't be beat. And as much as I've used this TV I can'tbeliev my bulbs are still good and I haven't had to replace them yet.The HD on this tv is AWESOME! On standard definition it is less tto be desired but tollerable. But who would buy this tv to watch standard deffinition TV? WHen I play my regular DVDs or Blu-Ray especially, picture is brilliant and just magnificiant! The colors are so clear and bright it is fun watching cartoon movies. Especially in BLu-Ray. \"Ice Age\", \"Monsters Inc\", \"Toy Story\" you couldn't ask for a better pisture. And I watched those from my cable TV provider on some regular HDTV station. And my old DVDs, \"Dirty Mary Crazy Larry\", \"Jeremiah Johnson\", \"Jaws\" all have a WAY better picture than I ecer seen them before.My ONLY regret was (when I bought this TV I did not care about the 3-D technology) I didn't get a 3-D ready Blu-Ray player and or the 3D kit that makes this TV 3D. I'm still hoping to get the kit nad add 3-D to this TV but concerned with costs at the time I opted out fo the 3-D stuff required and I wished now that I got it when I bought the TV.Either way, this TV is just as good as any Plasma, LCD or LED TV out there imo. And the bulbs to replace cost $60 each and there is only 3. ANd like I said, my bulbs are still going strong after a year of watching maybe on an average of 12-14hrs. a day. SO what is $60 to replace a bulb. And it's super easy to replace them. Instructions in the owner's guide make it basically like replacing any bulb in your house.THE ONLY NEGATOVE I HAVE ON THIS TV and it's pretty big one is this:When I go to play a Blu-Ray disc (standard discs work fine), the sound seems to go out completely on the ENTIRE TV. Even after switching back to cable tv. And the ONLY way I can seem to fix the problem is to turn off the TV, Thus having to wait about 10-15mins for the bulbs to cool down or TV to shut down. After turning it back on it seems to work fine.This is the only big issue I have had with this TV. Somehow playing a Blu-Ray disc messes with the INPUT & VOLUME on the TV itself. As I lose ALL VOLUME. TV and including my home stereo unit so somehow the volume input seems to go out ON THE TV ITSELF. Grant you I did by the cheapest Blu-Ray disc player that I could find. But it is obviously not the Blu-Ray DVD player because standard DVD disc work just fine and do not mess with the volume on the TV. And the TV volume goes out on the ENTIRE TV. No sound from ANYWHERE. And the only way to fix it is to turn the TV off and then back on later.So, I have basically given up on watching Blu-Ray disc on this TV and it does piss me off a bit. I might have watched about 5 Blu-Ray movies in the beginning when I got this TV and had no problems. A year later the volume goes out now if I go to play any Blu-Ray discs. ?? Might have something to do with the way it was hooked up as PAUL'S TV guys SUCK AT HOOK UPS and were rude and rushing to get out of my house as soon as they installed it. I complained about it to PAUL'S TV about they crappy cheap labor Mexicans that hooked it up \"their way\" instead of how I wanted it hooked up (to my home stereo audio reciver) but PAUL'S TV CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE basically just said \"Sorry about that.\". So cahnces are the hook up is why it does what it does. Still, the sound shouldn't go out on the ENTIRE TV. Especially the TV VOLUME ON THE TV. Oh well.

I use 5.1 sound, so i can't really comment on the sound but from the few minutes that I tried the TV speaker it was lough enough to act as a center speaker.

This television is a great value given the enormous amount of viewing area you get for the price.

The WD65738 also comes with a plethora of customizable picture settings.  Sound is not the greatest, but then again I don't route audio through the television anyway. (Buy the WD65838 if you want better sound from the TV.  Otherwise, run the audio through your AV receiver.)  The unit is also surprisingly lightweight for it's size, and for those who might be hesitant to purchase anything they can't mount to a wall, my receiver's depth (18 inches) is greater than the television's (16 inches).  I only mention this to highlight the fact it doesn't take up any more space than the rest of my components do (depth wise at least).  Besides, unmounted, this thing almost takes up an entire wall!Needless to say, I'm sold on DLP technology.  Watching a TV of this size (or greater) is as close as you are going to come to the theater experience.  Although I haven't tested the 3D, I could only imagine that it would probably be more immersive as well.

Even more so, I find the color balance of many large-screen televisions harsh and \"electronic\" looking, and I really appreciate the natural color balance of the DLP.In contrast to some other reviewers, I have had a very smooth experience.

Wasn't sure what to expect upon turning on the Mitsubishi WD 65738. I wanted to try a more \"cost effective\" 3D display and DLP fits the bill nicely so to speak. How does the image compare to the more recent Samsung LCDs I have had here? I will just say that this 65 inch TV is very impressive. It takes 1080p/24, deep color (upconverted 36 bit) and of course 3D. The image does not look as \"digital\" as the LCD panels and that is not a bad thing. And for a lot cheaper you can get a 65\" display then if you were to get a 55\" LCD. With the money you save you can purchase the Panasonic BDT100 3D Blu ray player and get some 3D glasses. Speaking of which I am now a true believer in how excellent 3D can look at home.So how does 3D really look? Awesome! Sharp and colorful and not to much where it gives you a headache. I imagine if you did an all day marathon you might be more suspect to feeling wierd or seeing double vision but for the most part one movie or maybe two most should be able to handle.There is an ADV menu setting that you can only access by tapping Menu 2457. Once in there you have a ton (I mean TON) of picture settings that may overwhelm many. There is also a Natural pic mode that looks about normal for most movie viewing. If you want the image to \"pop\" then the Brilliant pic mode is right for you. I use Brilliant for sports. Another cool feature is the Test Screen Image which allows you to check out your adjustments. There are options to turn 120hz on or off and for the most part I like it on. It is not overwhelming like many LCDs. This is the way it should be done. It looks like a \"Low\" mode on some displays. It really does help maintain sharpness and allow less judder during panning and fast action.It's just an amazing TV for an amazing price.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMAZING Picture", "Author": "j-fit", "ReviewID": "R2RPOPIESDU6V1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking at DLP's online for 2 months checking almost everyday on prices and new reviews.

Most reviews attempt to answer the question, which is better LED, LCD, Plasma, Laser or DLP. At one time or another I have had all of them except for Laser. I still have a Samsung LCD. What I have come to learn over the years is one is not necessarily better than the other, just different. For example, my Samsung LCD is great for general viewing. The Mitsubishi WD-65738 is great for watching movies. The reviews stating that the DLPs are a true theater experience hit the nail on the head. I was totally immersed in the experience. However, not all Mitsubishi DLPs are the same. The step-up 738 series has a marked increase in picture quality and clarity over the C-9 and C-10 models. I had a 4 day trial with the Mitsubishi C-9 and hated the experience. Even extensive tweaking did not help this model. When I tried the 738 series it was the difference between night and day. The 738 series required very little tweaking out of the box. I tend to toggle between Natural and Bright in the picture mode. I have read articles that say Mitsubishi has improved their presets closer to movie standards. This appears to be true. To be sure the Mitsubishi WD-65738 is an excellent HDTV, if you are looking for a true movie experience. Just be careful of the model/series number you get.Please note I have not yet tried 3D at this time.

The service people have said this is a Mitsubishi problem and they should repair it. It is a problem in the light engine and if the whole engine needs replaced it is about a $1000 repair which is almost as much as they now cost new. They think replacing a chip in the light engine may fix it and that is about a $400 repair. I will update after I find out what Mitsubishi says, but just having had this go on for this long would keep me from buying another. I have a 50\" Samsung Plasma and a 42\" Samsung LCD and although neither of them have hit the three year mark yet (getting close), they have been problem free. All have had a great picture.

The 65638 is just a plain basic model with very few options other than the minimum needed to watch TV, DVDs and 3D movies.The 65738 also offer much more functions than the 65638- So if I were you I would most definetely go with the 65738 model over the 65638. If your money is tight either hold off a month or two and save only a few hundred more dollars and get the 65738 model it will be well worth it. If you absolutely cannot get more money or don't want  to wait, then by all means get the 65638 you will not be disappointed. You absolutely should buy one of the two because for the price you will pay it will cost you at least twice or three times as much for the LCD and Plasma tvs. First of all Screw all the bad comments on this product - Now I am going to give it to you straight - If you have over $3,000 to spend on a TV then by all means get the Sony or Panasonic 65 inch TV because they are the best quality but if you are of modest income and have only $1500.00 or less to spend then go get yourself a treat and buy the Mitsubishi 65738 3D TV - you will love it straight out of the box and plugged in. You can tweak it later if you want but you will be blown away straight out the box. You will get on your knees and say thank you Jesus I didn't go wrong.
