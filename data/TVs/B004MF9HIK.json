I wish they'd just make all TV's without speakers, save us all the trouble. Yes, the speakers on this TV are horrible, but I'd expect that. The picture is solid. The 120Hz works well (on animated movies, live-action movies in 120Hz looks weird on any TV, looks unnatural), images are sharp, brightness is great, however the LED lighting is not uniform, at least on mine. When the screen is on, but black, you can see the un-uniform lighting of the screen. Most of the time, this is not noticeable, but you do notice it during very dark scenes in games and movies. Also, I have seen the problem another review saw, where the backlighting will change brightness. I had to turn a lot of stuff off in the picture settings in order to get it to stop. The User Guide isn't much help with the advanced image controls, so I just had to experiment. The Yahoo! apps are cool, as well as the Netflix app, but these are really just fluff features. While convenient sometimes, the novelty of looking at the weather on your TV wears off quickly. I'd rather have them spend the time on the backlighting issues. In all, it's a solid TV with a good picture except for the issues I noted above.

The speakers are terrible, which was expected, especially on a super-thin LED tv...not a problem since I expected it but you'd think with the amazing sound quality they get out of headphones, that they could do something similar with smaller speakers huh?I have had no issues after turning off the dynamic volume option and the auto dimming sensor option (would dim every time someone walked in front of the tv or if the sun covered up the clouds since it shines through our windows...was very annoying).My games look fantastic on it and movies are great and the streaming is a very nice touch since I have a media server in the house.  One issue I noticed was the sound is actually worse on the speakers whenever you're streaming from a media server (as opposed to watching tv or gaming) as I streamed from my Ps3 and the sound from the video was fine even on the tiny speakers, but it was terrible when it was streaming straight to the tv from the media browser.  I'm sure that I can remedy this once I hook up some 'real' speakers to it eventually.All in all, it's a great tv..slightly heavier than I expected it to be (think it weighs in at 35lbs?).  It's sleek, thin, picture is phenomenal. I have a 46\" Samsung LN46A550 in the living room and I notice this one having a much bright picture than my sammy.  Overall...I've very satisfied and I got a great deal on it even if it is slightly large for a bedroom setting.  ^_^", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Return to Sender - Try Again", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R3IZ5M9V11Z479", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I posted this to Toshiba's website today, but I'm posting it here for others to benefit from.Also, I FORGOT ABOUT THE BRIGHTNESS PROBLEM I had encountered when writing the Toshiba review, so I'll add it at the bottom.**************************Just got this set from Amazon about 3 weeks ago after laboriously weeding out others because of size/features. I'm returning it to Amazon today for a replacement. (( Thanks for great service AMAZON! ))I had fairly high expectations for the set, even though I'd seen online reviews that said the sound was lousy. When I first turned the set on, it was confirmed - the SOUND actually WAS LOUSY. What a surprise! The lack of analog RCA audio output jacks is a pain, but technology marches onward! With a purchased stereo adapter, we got our version of 4-ch simultaed stereo/quad.So, we gave the set a run for it's money. Within a couple of weeks, we found that the set randomly CYCLES ITSELF OFF for 15-30 seconds, and then turns itself back on again. (This is NOT a result of accidentally hitting the SLEEP MODE button on the remote control, as one might think.) At other times, several times a day the PICTURE would FREEZE for 15-30 seconds, and then the set would turn itself off and cycle back on, again without touching anything on the remote or the TV. MAGIC! (...or not)(Toshiba tech support documented the off/on cases and attempted to solve the problem, but finally indicated it was probably a power board problem - no at-home solution)Also, during the initial wired LAN setup and for a couple of weeks afterward, the NET TV button on the remote worked fine, bringing up a small whirling circle in the upper right hand corner (while it was \"thinking\") and then eventually bringing in the NET TV functions. This last week, the NET TV button would not bring up any functions. Even when you would use the remote's MENU button to bring up NET TV, there was no response once NET TV was chosen. Maybe I'm doing something wrong...Testing the network connection showed that the NETWORK CONNECTION WAS GOOD.(Toshiba tech support was NOT CONTACTED about this since the OFF/ON PROBLEM was going to require a return anyway)There was NO OWNER'S MANUAL in the original packaging - there's NONE BEING RETURNED. In the Easy Setup Guide it says to read the owner's manual before using the TV, but that manual was only available to us online, which prevented us from sitting in front of the TV while reading and learning about the features. It was a very large (many paged) manual, and now that this set is being returned, I'm glad that I didn't waste my ink/paper printing the manual up. PLEASE INCLUDE A MANUAL for the $1200 MFGR price tag TOSHIBA. Yes, some people use them. Don't want to print one up, Toshiba, then why not include an ONBOARD MANUAL in the TV's features??? Then, people without computers can learn how to use the set, even if they don't want to use all the NET TV functions. How is anyone supposed to see the manual that's only available online (without printing), unless they have a laptop??? Guess I'll need to get one of those, too...Minor issues, but worthy of looking into:In Netflix mode, if you try to adjust the picture size at all, all picture size modes go black (sound continues) until you exit the movie/program and then re-enter programming where you left off. This may be a Netflix issue, or it may be a TV issue... Not sure. An example would be watching an old TV series like X-Files where the television version was in 4:3, but I'd rather have the full sized theatre mode 1 or 2, thus eliminating the vertical black bars. Trying to adjust pic size, we'd lose the picture completely and have to exit the program, and then return to get the video picture back.With the TV connected directly (wired) to our LAN, and piles of pictures in our MY PICTURES profile, it never seemed to find most of the photos that were in Media Player, and going out of the Media Player on the TV and then coming back in would bring up different folders oftentimes, losing ones that it previously had found. It DID seem to find most of my MP3's, but would only play them one at a time. I MIGHT NOT HAVE FOUND the settings to tell it to play all/shuffle-repeat, but it wasn't immediately obvious how to do that. Might need that owner's manual while sitting there working the problem... It was also NOTORIOUSLY SLOW at bringing up anything on Media Player.Toshiba's biggest mistake on this set:The TV's onboard speakers are PATHETIC, but I had it hooked up to our analog sound system anyway. HOWEVER, EVEN THEN, the AUX (audio) button on the remote could not be linked to the remote's TV mode so that my external amplified sound could be adjusted while the remote was in TV mode. This was just a pain to switch back and forth from TV mode to AUX mode when needing to adjust or mute the TV... The TV speaker sound was always turned down since it sounded terrible. The solution to this would have been a Variable Audio Output on the TV that would allow you to use the TV speakers and an external audio system with one single volume controlling both. In our case, our Brighthouse remote DID allow linking the AUX (audio) volume to the CABLE remote functions on the Brighthouse remote, so we could use the Brighthouse remote to adjust the amplified volume while in CABLE mode, eliminating having to switch that remote to AUX mode just to adjust or mute sound. This is a bit of a pain while in Netflix mode or any TV mode on the Toshiba remote, since you have to switch back/forth to adjust/mute sound since the onboard speakers are terrible.Sorry Toshiba. I'm hoping the replacement doesn't have these same OFF/ON issues, but if it does, I'm returning that one, too, and switching to Samsung for awhile. I can live with lousy sound, since I can always buy a better sound system that uses the optical audio hookup, but still...*************************OK, I forgot to mention to Toshiba that their AUTOVIEW function is also terrible. I believe its' purpose is to adjust picture brightness based on room ambient brightness. In our case, when watching late at night, when ambient room lighting was low, the TV was automatically adjusting itself to its' own screen brightness with no changes in the room lighting. This was a bit disconcerting since the picture would shoot up to FULL BRIGHTNESS and then cycle back downward to normal room brightness. You could see the TV doing this in stages as is wound its' way back down, but then seconds later, it would pop on to FULL BRIGHTNESS again, and cycle back down. Obviously, this is either a defect in the TV or a poorly configured feature that is reacting to itself. My suggestion would have been to have the electric eye (that's monitoring ambient room lighting) at the back of some sort of tube so that it actually reads the lighting 10-15' away from the TV, not immediately in front of the TV. I think that's what's causing the rapid auto-adjustments back/forth. YES, YOU CAN TURN AUTOVIEW OFF, but what's the sense of having a feature that you have to dum down every day or forever? Why bother having the feature if you don't have the technology worked out, yet?BTW, I know everyone wants to know how the picture was (clarity, resolution, etc.) on this TV, and I liked the HD 1080i, but since NONE OF THE CABLE TV PROGRAMMING IS IN 1080p, I never got to see the TV (yet) in FULL 1080p Mode. My son is going to have to drag his gaming machine down to hookup to see how that works. Otherwise, I was happy with the picture, but these other issues seemed to overshadow my initial experience with this set.UPDATE August 21, 2011 - Posted a couple videos to YouTube showing one of the most major problems with this set, after returning the first & second sets, only to get this one with similar problems.[...]", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "great  TV for the money", "Author": "T.

The firmware updates were worthless. Every time I turned the TV on and wanted to connect with the internet it would always say network error while I'm on Netflix! It has a nasty habit of shutting itself down and turning itself on with a unchangeable black screen (it only changes when you pull the plug...). Every time I spoke to Toshiba's customer service it was like yelling at a brick wall, completely futile. They always told me that they were solving it or to get the latest firmware and when I did get the latest firmware (I already had but gave it another chance) they gave me the run-around and pretty much told me to piss off.The picture is wonderful, can't complain too much about the sound because its never on the TV system but instead played through my surround sound system. I got this TV for the Internet applicability and it has failed. Monday I am returning it and getting a larger Sony Bravia with similar and/or better features. In my opinion save your money and purchase something at least worth the paper it's printed on. I hope Toshiba focuses on their customer service and the technology that once drew me in as a customer.

We're wrapping up redecorating the bedroom and I sold the Toshiba 32\" LCD that we had in there. I wanted a moderately priced 40 or 42 inch TV to mount on the wall. We cancelled our cable service so I wanted to have Netflix and connection to our PC video files built into the TV that we purchase. This Toshiba advertised these features and since my previous two Toshiba TVs were so good I thought, why not?Once I got it home and mounted, the problems started to show up. The navigation through the menu is very slow. This is especially true when I connected to my Windows 7 PC over the network. Didn't matter if I used wireless or wired networking. Netflix works but it's very slow to connect and takes forever to load up the video once you are finally able to see all of the album covers. Then a few days later it stopped working and only showed the Getting titles screen. It wouldn't load any further. All of my other devices worked fine. I have an 8mbps internet connection.The built in audio is very thin and tinny sounding. To be expected, really. I'm going to buy a sound bar for it. The Samsung one looks like it's probably the winner.The picture on the screen is pretty good. No real complaints there. I don't see any splotches or light leaks. There aren't any dead pixels either.All in all, if you want to actually use this TV for its features, don't bother. Either look for something better in the competition's line up or buy a simpler TV and get separate set top box to handle the rest.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great bright picture, Wifi and other functionality are good!", "Author": "Vikas", "ReviewID": "R3NVBIR3I01VAA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this TV 3 weeks back, after the intial learning curve TV working great.Picture (5 star): great picture Bright and sharp, give a sony a run for its moneyNet TV (4 star): After the intial learning curve, worked seamlessly after hooking up the wifi.

This T.V is a complete joke, TV would turn off and back on with nothing happening. No way am I buying something that just turns off all by itself. Even firmware updates should resolve issues if this is the case.As mentioned my computer speakers have better sound than this TV and the people are wrong you should be able to expect better sound from a thin TV if my laptop can sound good and loud than a TV should sound like I am in a concert hall. No additional amplification or stereo should be required. My laptop sound actually drowned out the sound from T.V.(previous Update) OK an update to my review. Like others I have to agree the volume on this thing is just atrocious. Toshiba should be ashamed of the volume level for this T.V. virtually no bass what so ever even at the highest setting. I went too 100 on volume and it was still weak volume. Any outside noise almost drowned out the sound, my laptop has way better sound. I even watched a movie off laptop and the sound was louder on my laptop then on tv. This needs to be fixed because Toshiba touts sounds as crisp, clear and loud on web site. It was one of the highlighted features on website. What a joke.Standard definition output is just horrible, lots of ghosting and color spill. and the viewing angle is just awful as well. The only way to see the true vivid colors is to sit directly in front of T.V. I have gone through most of the settings and find that some things are lacking. I have bought several Toshiba's in the past and so far am a little disappointed. HD is decent but still see some artifacts where the picture is not as sharp as I feel it should be. I have a 32 LCD Toshiba 720p and I think the HD picture is much better running at 60 Hz. I expected much more then what I was lead to believe was superior features. 120mhz and 1080p the colors seems washed out almost a white cloud over the entire picture, which i think has to do with viewing angle. Wireless feature is sluggish and channel changes are slow from time to time slight delays like signal is not hitting receiver or a delayed process, the firmware did update once I went online automatically, but i had just done a firmware update like 1/2 hr. before and then this one came through right after that.The t.v. did shut off on me after being on for about fifteen minutes right out of the box, would not turn on for about 5 minutes no matter what i did, unplugged and eventually it did turn back on but that makes me a little nervous right off the back. No problem since then, the TV was on for about 6 hours steady after that with no issues but it does concern me. I called technical support which was just horrible. Tech tried to tell me to unplug and replug and that should rest t.v. tech tried to tell that this happens with all products from time to time and I just laughed at him and he hung up on me. Will need to complain to Toshiba about poor customer service. Typical overseas tech support, which is usually a joke. Stuck with the script throughout and never varied once so i was constantly cutting him off and not providing any info he was requesting. I gave serial number prior to talking to live support and he asked for the info all over again. I told him I had just given information and then he confirmed the info. Still wondering why he asked if the info was already staring him in the face. I verified info was correct before connecting.I thought this TV would connect via network and would see everything on network but this was not the case, I will need to tinker with this to see if i can get my digital movies to play through network. I have tons of movies already and was hoping to see them through this feature looks like some stuff is only readable through USB port will need to test.T.v. did say it was about to shut down because of no input signal was detected but i had been watching TV the entire time this message  came up. The TV was on for hours when this message came up, so not sure why it stop seeing signal when picture was actually displaying. Turned this feature off, not sure what the purpose of this feature. Cable was connected and showing an image so not sure why this came up to begin with.Trying to get TV to play sound through stereo when the cable is off and OTA (OVER THE AIR) is being watched might be a cable issue will review some more. Wish switching between cable and OTA was easier have to go through menu to change over. Remote is a little odd they have some tiny button at bottom of remote ( almost like tiny bumps roughly the size of a be be) These buttons actually seem to be utilized for several quick feature that are used often. The tiny buttons are just stupid in this way since the remote is so large they should have full size button for all features. the room is there why not have full size. Awkward placement of button on remote not very intuitive like most remotes. I hate when designers think they are being clever but screw up the placement of buttons, a lot reach overs mute and other buttons not placed properly need big hands too, remote is rather large. I have big hands and remote is still a monster. and tiny buttons don't help either.I wish the back port came straight out instead lying flat little hard to hook things up and why have the audio 3.5 mm instead of standard RCA is just stupid, they do give you a converter cable but why, just have standard RCA outputs. I understand this works for have flat up against a wall but still difficult to hook things up in this way. other Toshiba's have the typical outs so not sure why the changed for this model(s).Yes, paper manual is horrible many features and settings are not discussed and minimal help, basically shows how to set-up which is the easy part. The settings are what you really need a manual for, glad they have a downloadable version with all features documented but why not provide in the box, cheap b@stards. Who wants to read a PDF version on a laptop to make adjustments, this is just silly. What happens if you don't have access to internet, you are basically screwed.Using the remote to act as a keyboard to log into twitter, facebook or other sign-ins is just a joke cumbersome and not intuitive at all. They should have cellphone number and letters like text buttons to input data, at least it would be faster and easier since everyone kind of knows how to use the buttons in this manner, switching between upper and lower case requires hitting another button on remote and then there are confirms for everything, why? I know what i want to do, seems like they are taking a page from windows with the confirms. menus and settings are not intuitive at all, another designer trying to be clever but poor layouts and cumbersome to get around. Why hasn't the electronic firms gotten a clue how to design these things, its been several decades since many of these products have been out and they still struggle with this. Why not a standard that everyone follows much easier for the consumers if it was all standard.Setup did take a few hours trying to understand menus, remote and still need to review some settings. should be much easier to set-up tv right out of the box. Its great to have options but really how detailed and technical do i need to be in order to set-up tv. Some settings are just overkill since I don't think anyone will ever fine tune things to the degree of features provided, basically overkill for setting up basic options. I see myself as a techie but this is just ridiculous. not trying to get into curves and fine tune to that degree, really not required I don't think. Contrast and brightness are not apparent at all when making adjustments. many features are buried in the menus so need to go through all setting to make-sure you found them all, i am pretty sure i missed quite a few, will go through another round tomorrow to figure out what i missed, at this point disappointed but only had on for a day so will need to review settings.Wish i could save my settings but don't see that feature in the menus, would be nice. still trying to figure out how to add and subtract channels instead of going through auto tuning, pick up some channels but don't show anything on screen so not sure how to delete, will go through manual some more to figure out.Overall, I would give a 4 out of 10 rating at this point. sound is a major turn off, should not have to hook-up to stereo to hear sound properly. AC fan drowned out sound to the point it was difficult to hear, even at highest level. For what Toshiba bragged about and what I got I am very disappoint at this point. expected a lot better from Toshiba. Would not recommend as a good buy, do more research and test features in store. and try them all out and don't just accept the advice of sales or tech, test out feature for yourself and save yourself the trouble of having to return This TV to store which I eventually did.

I have been using it for 1.5 years in my bedroom.  Picture quality is good and that is about it.  Dynamic sound does not work.

I was constantly having to readjust when all I wanted to do was unwind and relax in bed.  I disabled this \"feature.\"2 weeks ago the TV started turning itself off in the middle of programs.  I turn it back on and it might be 1/2 hour or more and then it would shut off again.I called tech support after googling and seeing this was a very common problem with Toshiba TVs.  Google did not have an answer.  Neither did tech support who suggested a power surge.  I said it is plugged into a surge protector and this is a common complaint with the tv.  They said to unplug if for 4 hours \"to drain all the power out\" and then plug it back in. If that didn't work than they gave me a number for service indicating I most likely had to replace a power board in the TV.  Really?  It did not work.  I don't want to pay to have a service person come out and then pay for a replacement part that is obviously faulty and odds are the problem will return given what I see on Google.I will never ever buy a Toshiba again!

The sound is extremely inconsistent, even with the dynamic volume turned off. I was looking forward to using the dynamic volume function to avoid the much higher volume of commercials, but I was sorely disappointed. With dynamic volume on, the sound drops to almost nothing at the beginning of a commercial and then builds back up within 10-15 seconds. However, when the show returns, the sound also drops and you wait for it to rise enough to hear after missing 10-15 seconds of dialog. I knew better than to expect superb sound from these tiny speakers, and the sound quality is not really the issue, it's the inconsistency that is extremely aggravating, especially for a brand new, high tech, led tv.I have spoken with a Toshiba tech, who just read from her script how to adjust the sound settings (that I had already done many times). She also said over and over that you can't expect good sound from such a thin tv and that I sould just buy some small speakers to use with it. Needless to say, I was very unimpressed with their support. She said I should call back to speak with a manager, which I have yet to do, but I am not hopeful.There is also an issue with the picture brightness which changes periodically even with the dynalight feature turned off.
