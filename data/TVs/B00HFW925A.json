While it is missing some features and has fairly limited menu options the excellent picture quality and built in apps make this well worth the low price.After living with the TV for less than a week my main complaints are:  - can't rename channels  - no channel favorites  - firmware updates seemed to wipe out most of the customization I'd done to the apps and widget dock  - cheap remote without lighted buttonsPros  - great picture  - decent sound (I had assumed I'd immediately need a sound bar but have decided I can wait for now)  - built in Netflix, Amazon, etc.  - attractive design with very thin bezel around the screen  - large screen size for a low price", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive image for the price", "Author": "LFP", "ReviewID": "R34C2AFFY3VXO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a 50\" LG Plasma for 4 years until the switch unexpectedly broke. Given the age of the set and that it went through multiple moves where the packers didn't treat anything gently, it seemed best to find a replacement. The room that the plasma was in has a lot of windows and a huge skylight,which meant that the Plasma was almost unwatchable when the sun was out - the reflections off the glass were severe. I suppose I could have invested in blackout blinds, or bricked in all the windows but I'm not a fan of the dungeon aesthetic.So, I figured a LED LCD screen would be good to try.Pros:1./ Price - $650 delivered (Prime) is pretty decent.2./ Reflections - this screen is very visible even in bright light, which is great if you don't live in a dungeon or bonus dungeon.3./ Smart TV - has the basic apps to watch Prime, Netflix, etc.4./ Good looking - it has a narrow bezel which enhances the viewing experience. I am not sure what that's all about but people who come round say it.5./ Brand - I know its a 'budget' brand but I've yet to meet someone say they regretted buying one of these things. :6./ Image quality - surprisingly good. OK its not a plasma but if you calibrate it you get surprisingly good black levels. I don't play games so I'm not sure if it blurs when you're doing the wild thing with your boyfriends on Call of Duty 15 (no disrespect intended).7./ Good sound for a panel- checked it briefly before plugging in the 5.1 system.Cons1./ In a dark room it is not as vibrant as a plasma. Then again, the super high end LCDs aren't either, despite the hype - and this is not super high end at all.2./ It's apparently eco-friendly which means it's probably related to Al Gore and the Sierra Clubi some nefarious way.3./ Thing weighs as much as a plasma - seriously.What's up with that?4./ It's a bit thick but then so are all LCDs. Not Beyonce thick but there it is.5./ Takes about 15 seconds to 'boot up'. Doesn't bother me but if you're a tier-one, high-speed low-drag, spec ops couch commando this is going to compromise your tv watching mission.Here are some settings I stole earlier.

TV's picture is AWESOME!  My cable connection is just basic standard def, but still looks good.  (I tried some over the air HD signals for a little while and it was an awesome picture.)  I've streamed Netflix in HD and it looks very good.  I still had to use my Comcast digital converter box (not real happy about that, but it's ok).The one BIG issue you MAY run into is with the wireless connection to your router.  I could not get the TV to connect wirelessly to my router at first.  I have a basic Netgear wireless G router (WGR-614).  Googled the issue and saw numerous reports from others about incompatibility between Netgear routers and Vizio TV's.  Tried some of the solutions to no avail.  Finally what I figured out is that the TV would not connect using WPA2-PSK (AES).  I had to set my router to use both WPA-PSK (TKIP) and WPA2-PSK (AES) and the TV finally connected using the WPA-PSK (TKIP) security!  The tip off that it was going to work was when I was in the on-screen keyboard screen entering the wireless passphrase it showed \"WPA-PSK\" above the passphrase entry box.  Making this security change on my router is somewhat of a security risk, but in the rural area I live in I didn't mind.  You should be aware of the possible security risk where you are if you run into the same problem.Once I connected I tested out the Netflix app.  It connected to my account and streamed my first test movie just fine (showed flipping between medium HD & high HD quality) with just some slight buffering as it got started.  I haven't played much with other apps yet to report on them.The remote does have tiny buttons, but it's not too awful for me.  We have another Vizio TV and we are used to the Vizio menus.All in all I think this was a good purchase.  I knocked down a star due to the frustration of getting a wireless connection and the necessary downgrade in my router's security.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "VIZIO has won me over!", "Author": "m.randowjr", "ReviewID": "R2WACAHVEIQQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was reluctant to purchase this TV at first as it was only my second HDTV purchase and my first one was a 43 inch Samsung plasma TV. The Samsung's panel died on me about 2 weeks ago after working great since I bought it in May 2011. Luckily, I had purchased a 3 year warranty through Squaretrade and they got my refund to me super quick (highly recommended). I came across this VIZIO and it basically owns the best reviews for a 50 inch LED (now I see why), so after a little research I went for it and I really feel like I hit a home run with this one.Picture Quality:Having previously owned the 43 inch Samsung Plasma, I can definitely say the blacks are nicer on the Samsung, but that's  be supposed to be a strength for a plasma TV. Being an LED, this VIZIO has more than adequate blacks in its display of HD and even standard channels. The overall display of standard channels on this VIZIO have a decent looking picture. HD movies are true 1080p and beautiful.Sound Quality:I think the sound quality of this TV is adequate, not awesome, but adequate. If you're wanting an impressive home theater experience from an audio standpoint then I think a sound bar or a surround sound system would be the way to go here.Functionality:The TV, out of the box takes about 15 minutes to set up if you're taking your time. The remote is a little small, but unless you have massive hands it shouldn't be an issue. When you go to turn on the TV it takes about 15 seconds from when you press the power button to when you see the screen display the picture. Maybe that's too long for some people, it doesn't bother me. The Wifi connection process is fast, smooth, and seamless. As far as the Smart TV features go, it's very non-invasive. Pops up at the press of the big \"V\" button midway up the remote and it displays the scrollable bar along the bottom of the screen with everything from Netflix & Hulu Plus to YouTube, Twitter, Skype, and Facebook.I know this review has nothing to do with a Squaretrade warranty, but I felt compelled to reiterate that their warranties are so valuable. I bought a 4 year warranty for this TV that cost $99.99, but I found a 35% off coupon code that made the warranty only $70 after tax. Just thought I'd throw that out there.Overall, I would say if you're looking to go bigger than the 40 inch range with a HDTV that really delivers in quality and performance without breaking the bank, then this is the TV for you!", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "GoBeavs", "ReviewID": "R17DGVZXPAZUH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why I am reviewing: Lack of reviews on this set currently with several of them giving a poor rating. Some of the issues other reviewers were having sounded like they might be user error. Either way, I feel this is a trusted brand at the right price so and the size that I needed so I went ahead and bought it regardless of the reviews.Background: My other tvs are Pioneer Kuro models I bought several years back (and have never regretted - they are simply the best), but I needed a smaller tv for our exercise room. Based on the location of our equipment, 32\" was a little small so I needed something in the 37 to 40\" range and this one fit the bill nicely.Setup: The directions for putting on the stand did not work well for me. The quick start guide had me lay the tv flat on the floor and then try to mount the stand. The problem with this is with the tv flat on the floor, unless you live in a split level and hang the bottom of the tv over the stair it is nearly impossible to hold up the tv while trying to attact the stand. I disassembled the stand and went in a different order, attaching the back of the stand to the tv first. Then I could use the stand to hold onto, lifting up the set and attaching the base. This seems like a much better process and I don't know why the directions don't follow this route.Looks: This TV looks great. The thin bezel is excellent, giving the appearance of almost all screen. Really looks great. The speakers are thin along the bottom of the set and hardly noticeable. Overall I really like the appearance of this set.Remote:Not fancy or expensive, but nice. Buttons have a tactile feel, with a real click for button presses. I like this approach. It also feels good in the hand.Startup: I had no issues here. Menus were responsive and intuitive (no delays like some other review said). It found my home network just fine and the onscreen keyboard to enter network password was very quick and responsive. Easy step by step process to register the tv and apps. Picture came on at the end of this and looked great. I was in a room where the light was changing slightly from outside and I could see the tv adjust by the second. I don't care for this feature so I turned it off as other reviewers have done.This feature was easy to find in the picture adjustment settings and while there I could see the set has a good amount of adjustments available. I generally don't like to mess with these too much so I chose one of the presets, \"basketball.\" I chose this because basketball is my favorite sport. I like the way they dribble up and down the court. But I digress.I tuned to ESPN (DirecTv) and was very happy with the picture. Colors were bright and the screen really looked good. Viewing angles are amazing and have come a long way over the years. I remember earlier sets where off angle viewing was challenge, with the picture looking very dim the farther off angle you got. No such problem with this set. You can view from as far off angle as you can get until you are looking at the side of the tv, with no noticeable change in brightness. Reaction times are very good and the set handles motion very well.The TV was set up in a room with one window on the right side of the room. Viewing from the left and straight on I could not notice and reflectivity but moving over to the right side I could notice the reflections from the window. It was fairly bright outside so unless you are viewing off angle opposite a window during daytime hours this shouldn't be too much of a problem.I was very satisfied with the sound as well. I left the SRS setting turned on and the sound was crisp and clear with good volume. I'm sure I won't have any issues hearing over our exercise equipment in this room.Now it was time to try the internet features. One feature I really looked forward to on this TV was the ability to watch Amazon Prime videos. If you don't have Amazon Prime - what are doing? You are doing it wrong. The best $79.99 you will ever spend. Anyway, I pressed the dedicated Amazon button on the remote and got no response. I tried the Netflix and M-Go buttons located in the top row as well and they worked find. So checking the quick start guide, I was directed to the V.I.A. button to get started with Vizio internet apps. I was then directed to select \"connected tv store\" to search for apps that were not yet installed. Since I did not see Amazon prime anywhere in the menu, I was hopeful I could find it here. Upon selecting, I was advised that there was an update to this app and to select \"OK\" to download and update this app before I would be able to use it. This took only a minute or two and upon finishing I found that Amazon Prime was now one of the available apps. I went through the sign up process so the tv would recognize my Prime account and allow me access to content. This brought up an on screen code and I was directed to my computer to enter this on the amazon site. Once completed the tv recognized that I had registered it with amazon and allowed access to the thousands of shows and movies available to me as a Prime subscriber.Once this was completed I exited out of Prime and attempted to use the dedicated Amazon button on the remote once again and this time, success!I loaded up Prime and selected in Instant Videos to see the selection of HD movies available to me for free. To my surprise, Evil Dead 2 was one of the choices. I selected this movie and after about one minute it was ready for viewing. Playback was flawless, the picture looked great and I was pleasantly surprised with the SRS audio as well.Overall I am extremely happy with my choice. I don't understand the issues other reviewers have had; maybe these were earlier production units and these glitches have been resolved on later units. I don't think there is a better set out there for $479. Outstanding value and I highly recommend if you are in the market for a 40\" tv.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT IN EVERY WAY !!", "Author": "Monu", "ReviewID": "R3OG44E0J7NUSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In general - if you want quality - you usually don't get it cheap. But with VIZIO - specially with this specific model - it's great in every way, and still priced REALLY LOW - specially considering all the features included!I have always bought higher end TVs - by Samsung & Sony. They do deliver quality - but their prices are also on the much higher side. I needed to buy another TV - for my basement den/office. I did not want to spend much - as my primary TVs were in the living room & bedroom - both LEDs - one by Sony, one by Samsung. After checking out a lot of reviews - and even going to Wallmart / Bestbuy etc to actually watch this VIZIO playing side by side with other TVs, I decided to go for this TV.Well, to keep it short, this TV has EVERYTHING :- Superb Picture Quality.- Really pure Whites : Almost none of the low/medium price TVs are able to deliver proper whites. But this one produces really accurate whites.- Really deep blacks. OK - perhaps not AS deep as those high end LEDs with local dimming, but no casual viewer can tell the difference. I actually do look very carefully - but even I will not be able to casually notice the difference. Infact, when blacks are REALLY deep - there is a problem too - details in the dark areas of the picture are rendered completely black too - destroying picture details ....so I actually prefer a level of darkness not intensely black.- SMART TV Options : It has them all ! ....Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Prime, etc etc. The SMART OPTIONs INTERFACE is slightly slow to maneuver, but once the videos are started - they play flawlessly. Connecting to my wireless network was easy.- REMOTE : Well, if you are going to be extensively using the smart feature - for using with Youtube / Netflix etc - you may want to buy a remote which comes with a QWERTY keyboard on the reverse side. These are available really cheap - on Amazon or eBay. I bought a used one for just over $10 - and it works perfectly. The remote included has everything - but lacks the QWERTY keyboard.- SOUND : Sound is good - loud & clear - vocals are clearly heard. However, if you are seriously into great sound quality - you may want to buy & connect an additional sound-bar, or an external sound system.I set the picture to VIVID - with GAME MODE enabled. That got me the best picture quality as per my taste. You will have to play around with the settings for a while to get the right picture quality. Out-of-the-box settings are not optimum.120Hz is claimed - though it is not a true 120hz. I have SAMSUNG'S high end 120hz TV - and though there is a little difference in very fast motion - but you have to actually look for it to notice it.Overall - for approx $400 (including shipping!) - this is a SUPERB DEAL & a SUPERB TV !

We don't currently have cable so we purchased it mostly for its internet apps. They work very well. The biggest downfall using the apps is the TV remote. Since it is not a full QWERTY keyboard, typing in what you would like to watch can be annoying. We use the YouTube app a lot but searching can be a pain without the full keyboard. Luckily, we downloaded the YouTube remote controller app and are able to set up playlists from our phone once we have the YouTube app up and running on our TV. Great solution! We also use the Netflix app and have had some problems with it. Every once in a while the show we are watching freezes up and then after a few seconds our TV turns itself off. We think it is just the NetFlix app itself because we haven't encountered this problem when watching it through our Wii or Xbox. Other than those few problems the apps work fast and well. I will be looking into getting Amazon Prime soon so I am able to access their streaming videos as well. We have also tried using a USB drive to load movies and shows onto our screen as well. Tips for anyone doing this, the video files that this TV can read are avi. and mp4. You need to have the TV turned off when plugging in your USB drive in order for the TV to recognize the device, as well as turning it off before removing it. Plays videos well; we ended up purchasing a USB drive specifically for watching videos and movies on the TV. This TV does not recognize large external hard drives. We tried using our 1.5 TB hard drive but it was not registering on our TV.The picture quality is great, no complaints at all. I particularly love how thin the frame of the TV is around the screen; it gives you the most screen space possible. It is a bit bulkier in the back, not super thin as some TV's but it doesn't make a difference to me since no one is going to be looking at it from behind. All the hook ups are on the back and can be easily concealed. Power button, volume buttons and all other TV control buttons can be found on the left side of the TV. It took no time to install and set up our TV and it looks great! This TV really packs a punch with all it has to offer for it's price. We've had our TV now for 2 months with little to no complaints and love it. Many other smart TVs go for hundreds more and this one has it all for a much smaller price.

Gaydos \"Tom G.\"", "ReviewID": "RN0WPMXOPG690", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an incredibly well designed 24-inch Smart TV with a stunning picture, slim profile, plenty of useful apps, and a low price. The only thing holding it back from being a perfect 5-star TV is the lack of a QWERTY remote to make proper use of the apps and having only 1 HDMI connection.DESIGNAll black with a very slim bezel and less than 2\" total depth. This thing is pretty sexy, especially for a \"budget\" TV. The stand will make some happy, other no so much. It's basically a fixed picture frame style where the TV itself sits directly on whatever surface you have it on. This gives it more of an all-in-one PC appearance than that of a TV. It sits at a fixed angle that I didn't care for at first, but it's actually the perfect angle for sitting on a kitchen counter, which is where I have it. At any rate, I like the design as does my fiancee. It looks much more high-end than its price would indicate. At less than 8 lbs and with a VESA 100 mounting pattern, you could easily and inexpensively mount this pretty much anywhere.SET UPSetting up the TV itself took about 5 minutes. Unboxed it, plugged it into the wall and cable box, turned it on and set up the WiFi. Everything worked perfectly. The picture calibration out of the box on \"normal\" was one of the most accurate default picture representations I've ever seen. I've been seeing this comment a lot with Vizio's new E-series line. This is rare, as I usually spend between 15 and 30 minutes tweaking the picture settings. About 2 minutes with this one and I was happy. Logging into the apps was more challenging than it should have been because Vizio inexplicably doesn't include their nifty little QWERTY remote with this set. More on that in the Apps section below. All-in-all...pretty easy to set up. The lack of a 2nd HDMI port bothers me a bit. It's 2013 and everything connects via HDMI. Add a 2nd port, Vizio.PICTUREThe picture on this TV is stunning with vibrant colors and deeper blacks than I expected from an edge lit LED setup. The slim bezel really helps the picture pop and, as I noted above, the default picture settings are very accurate. There are several picture mode presets, including an eye-popping \"vibrant\" setting for those preferring boosted color saturation. I've never seen a TV of this size at any price point with a better picture.SOUNDThis set has stereo 2W front-firing speakers built-in which can be set to mono, stereo, or a simulated surround setting. If you're going to be gaming or watching movies on this set, you'll want a sound bar or a decent 2.1/3.1 setup, for everyone else these built-in speakers will suffice. When set on the simulated surround mode the sound stage is surprisingly wide to the point where it will occasionally bounce a sound so that is seems to be coming from behind you. It's nothing earth-shattering and there is no real bass, as expected, but as far as built-in TV speakers, they do a pretty good job. For my kitchen use of this TV, they're perfectly serviceable.APPSI have been waiting for this TV specifically because it's a 24\" 1080p LED Smart TV. It is currently the only 24\" Smart TV on the market. The apps available are most of the ones you would hope for; Netflix, Amazon video, Vudu, Hulu Plus, Rhapsody, Pandora, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Notably missing is HBO Go and MLB.tv, neither of which are currently available on any Vizio TV. The apps that are available respond quickly, and most can run while the current program is playing (you can tweet while watching the game, for example). With all of these great apps, I was absolutely floored that Vizio chose not to include it's QWERTY remote with this TV. It's a puzzlingly stupid decision as the lack of this QWERTY remote makes using the apps unnecessarily difficult. Once you're logged in to all of your apps, basic searching is OK, as the included remote is functional and responsive, but the lack of the QWERTY keyboard on the back makes using Facebook and Twitter highly unlikely, which is a shame because otherwise they are solid apps.CONCLUSIONThe picture quality, high-end design touches, and quality apps more than make up for the lack of QWERTY remote and single HDMI port. If you're looking or a Smart TV for a kitchen, bedroom, or dorm room, this set is a stunner that's easy on the wallet. This is my 4th Vizio TV dating back 6 years and all of them function perfectly and without a single issue, so this is a trustworthy brand. If you're on the fence, go get it. You won't be sorry.UPDATEI purchased this QWERTY remote: New!

I placed it near my LG LM7600 47\" model (which I have been extremely happy with) for a side-by-side comparison.  After some tweaking of the Picture settings, the results were very satisfactory.  I realize that comparing the two models maybe like comparing apples and oranges, since there was a big price difference between them.  But for the price of the Vizio I think that its picture quality and sound are very good.I also set-up the Network connection (via WiFi) and experienced no initial problems.....at least with the internet connection.  I signed on to Amazon and scrolled through its offerings with no problems.........but I didn't attempt to load any movies.  Honestly I didn't buy this model for its Smart TV functions since I am taking it to a mountain cabin where there is no internet access.It does take several seconds to power up (much longer than the LG), but that's no problem for me.  I think that it maybe connecting to the internet prior to bringing up the screen view.  It will be interesting to see if it activates faster at the cabin with no network to connect with.The settings menu is basic, not nearly as detailed as the LG.  For example, I did not see a way to update the firmware via online connection, so not sure if that is an option. Also the only input connection I tried was the coaxial cable for TV viewing.  Once I set it up at the cabin I will connect to a blu-ray player via \"HDMI\", and the receiver via the \"component\" & \"optical audio\" outputs and check their status.  At its price point I think that it is a good deal and will initially conclude with a tentative endorsement....to be followed by a later update.Day 20 Update:So far, no problems experienced.  Granted I only use the unit for (1) watching BRs, DVDs, and as a PC monitor at a mountain cabin with no OTA or Cable TV reception.  I used Disney's WOW calibration disc but the changes were minimal using the \"Custom\" picture setting.  I lowered the Sharp level slightly from the default setting.  The other default settings were already close to the WOW calibrated results.I have noticed that the Picture is noticeably better watching Blu-rays than DVDs, but that could be attributed to the Blu-ray player (Panasonic BMP-BDT310).  The built-in speakers are adequate, but I am using a 5.1 audio theater speaker setup, with great sound.As stated above, It still takes several seconds to power up (over 20 seconds).  Another possible reason may be because it is Direct-Lit LED (an economical type of Full-Array LED that uses fewer LED lites behind the screen).  That is definitely the reason the unit is thicker than an edge-lit model.  No light bleeding or clouding noticed and it seems that the picture quality has continued to improve over the past 20 days.For the price I think that it is as good a set as could be expected and so I continue to rate it 5 stars.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Picture!", "Author": "R53", "ReviewID": "R14K4SX3F1UZVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The quality of the picture can't be beat at this price or several hundred dollars more.The apps are great and the config was very easy.These are the picture settings I used.Before you can adjust the \"Backlight\" setting go to*Advanced Picture submenu* and turn off \"Ambient light sensor\"*Picture settings menu*Picture Mode: MovieBacklight: 85 - Before you can adjust this setting go to *Advanced Picture submenu* and turn off \"Ambient light sensor\"Brightness: 43Contrast: 50Color: 55Tint: 0Sharpness: 6*Color Temperature submenu*Color temperature: CustomRed Gain: 45Green Gain: 48Blue gain: 50Red offset: 49Green offset: 48Blue offset: 50*Advanced Picture submenu*Noise Reduction: OffMPEG NR: OffColor Enhancement: OffAdaptive Luma: MediumFilm Mode: AutoSmart Dimming: OnAmbient Light sensor: Off", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "No more Skype app", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R2V4FVV52TC3NE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is the newest \"Smart\" TV from Vizio.

The frame is very thin around the screen, as you can see in photos, so it looks pretty nice.  It is not the thinnest TV ever, but it is still pretty thin and the connections on the back are vertically positioned, so you can place it back against a wall easily.-Built-in web apps:  There are quite a few to choose from, though for me the most important are Netflix, Amazon Video, Youtube, and Pandora.  There are a host of other random things that I have little use for.  The functionality is pretty much the same as I have seen on Roku, and it is nice to have all of that built into one device and on one controller.-Sound:  The speakers are surprisingly loud for such a small TV.  They are relatively clear as well.  Don't mistake this to mean that there's exceptional bass or highs or that it simulates surround well, or anything magical, it simply produces loud and clear stereo that is more than sufficient for a large bedroom, which is all I needed.-Picture:  Clear and bright, although there are a few jagged edges at times and the color depth does not quite compare to my Sumsung 50A550 50\" Plasma.  Then again, not much does.  Perhaps with some tweaking I can make it a bit better.  Overall, unless you're pretty picky and have a high-end TV to compare to, I don't think you will be disappointed.  It is sharp and overall looks good.-Tuner:  Seems to pick up most of the channels in my area (over the air) but does not pick up as well as my Samsung.  They both use the same rooftop antenna and the same signal booster and actually the Samsung's cable run is longer and goes through more devices but it does a better job of picking up weak channels.  However, only the very weakest channels (40 miles away) are dropped, so I'm relatively pleased.Now for the reason that it gets a 4 and not a 5:-Wireless connectivity:  This TV has built-in wireless.  If you look at the instructions that come along with the TV though, you are basically informed that it is preferred to use a wired connection.  I had no problem going through and setting up the TV to connect wirelessly to my router, and it seemed to connect just fine.  I pulled up Netflix and browsed through and everything was fine.  But I discovered that after 10-20 minutes of watching anything on Netflix or Youtube, the connection would drop and the built-in wireless would crash.  It would not come back until I turned the TV off and back on again, sometimes not even coming back until I had unplugged and replugged the power cable.  Pretty annoying.  Not sure if its a problem with firmware or hardware.  Certainly not a problem on my end.  I run an Asus RT-N66U router and a Cisco DPC3010 modem, neither of which gives me any trouble (as they shouldn't, they are both pretty expensive devices) and all of my other devices (PS3, two laptops, two phones, and a wireless printer) are all maintaining perfect connections.  So I ended up having to use a spare router as a wireless bridge and hook the TV to it with a cable, and now everything works great, but it was a pain to set up.My overall impression is that this is a good TV.  For the price, you simply cannot beat the features, but if all of the features do not work, are you getting the best deal?  For me it was fixable with what I had at home, but if this is a problem with all of these units, you may not have all of the features you are promised.  I can only hope this is an isolated issue.  If it isn't a risk you are willing to take, you may consider getting a similar, less expensive Vizio TV with none of the internet apps and internet connectivity features and just spend 50 bucks on a low-end Roku.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Have Received 2 and sent both back within the first day of use", "Author": "Lynne", "ReviewID": "R1I3WSPOT1EH7W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had a horrible time with this TV.

For the settings, 1080P and 120Hz, its worth it.My only issues with this item was the remote and the streaming/load times for the Smart HDTV features. Out of the box there is an initial setup that requires your name, wireless router connection, password input. The remote was not designed for this at all. There's a pop up keyboard that you have to use the remote to navigate, not fun.As for the Smart HDTV features a little on the slow side. Not streaming wise, but loading wise. Example: You click on HuluPlus/Netflix, it asks you if you'd like to start the application, and then it takes 30-45 seconds to load, once in the actual application responses are slow, the icons for various shows take time to load up, moving to another category takes time. Don't even attempt to use a \"Search\" option with the stock remote (lol). Once you find the movie you want it's great! It streams wonderfully (depending on your internet speed), the time you spend to get to that movie, not so wonderful.Now mind you. If you're buying this TV.

So this review covers initial impressions, ease of setup, etc.OK, I use this for a bedroom TV, using OTA (over the air) tv signal.  I also have the VIA (Vizio Internet Apps) functioning via WIFI.Packaging - box weighs about 15 lb, so this is light weight.  This can be good or bad, we will see.  Being light weight helps ensure safe shipping, so that is good.  Arrived from Amazon, via UPS, in good shape.Open to watching TV was probably 45 minutes - this included changing antennas (requiring 2 scans).  I pulled off foam blocks, removed from plastic bag, located the base and attaching screw.  The base is held on with a single screw, Allen wrench included.  Easy peasy.  Set on stand, attach power cord, put batteries in remote, connect antenna.On power up, asks for either home use, or store demo, what type of signal (cable or antenna), and then scans for channels.  The bedroom is on the second floor, and the antenna is a Mohu Leaf - so I was able to pull in plenty of stations, with very good signal quality.Next I setup Netflix, and Amazon Prime - this probably takes 15 minutes for both.  Typing in the passwords with the remote is tedious, but that is the same with all remotes, and long passwords.Initial impression of picture/sound quality - this is a 720p TV, so that considered, very good.  sound is fine, and allows external speakers.Price is very good, and overall value is high.

My mom bought this TV for us on August 31st. Approximately one month later, it would start to just randomly shut itself off then restart. I did some googling and discovered that this is a common issue for Vizio TVs. (We'll be sitting here watching Netflix or regular TV and all of a sudden the screen will go black then the \"V\" logo will appear and it will be on regular TV. It even logs me out of Netflix completely.) I tried unplugging the TV and holding down the power button and then plugging it into a different outlet. That didn't correct the problem. On October 26th, I sent an email to Vizio to request that they fix or replace the TV. They suggested doing the same thing I had already done (unplug, hold power button down, etc.). I tried that again and the TV went a whole 2 days without restarting.So I emailed them again on November 14th and they gave me a customer service number to call. I called that number today and the guy on the phone told me that it would take about 5-6 days to repair and they would send someone out. Then he realized that the TV would have to be sent in and was going to schedule that. So basically they wanted me to send in this defective TV and then sit here with no TV for the next two weeks while they fix it (one week for shipping back and forth, one week for repairs.) This isn't acceptable, especially for a product that apparently has this problem a lot and is clearly defective. It's a $250 TV. Shipping and repairing it would cost that much. I just want the stupid thing replaced. Why should we have to sit here and go two weeks without out when the problem is on their end? I can get my car repaired in less time than that.Bottom line: don't buy this as your main or only TV unless you're prepared to spend a couple of weeks without it so it can be repaired.UPDATE January 2014: In spite of many attempts to get this resolved with Vizio, I have reached a dead end. They tell me to send a copy of the receipt and when I do, they tell me that large files have to be sent to a \"photos at vizio dot com\" email address. I've done that twice now. The first time, I received a reply that no cases with my incident number or email address can be found even though I used the exact same case number and email address as I've been using for over two months and numerous emails. The second time, I received absolutely no response.Vizio's idea of customer service seems to be \"ignore the customer and eventually they'll give up.\" They don't care if they lose a customer because another gullible one will come along.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesomeness!", "Author": "B.

Instead of WPA2, set the settings toWPA-PSK [TKIP] + WPA2-PSK [AES].  If you change it to just WPA-PSK, it will not use the full speed of the router.Once I made the changes to the router I went into network settings on the TV and I had to manually input the router name (SSID) but then the rest was easy and it connected quickly to the VIA interface.I also changed my ratings on the TV to 4 stars total.  I would have given it 5 stars but they do not explain to you in the setup process about the router.UPDATE: 05/05/13I have had this TV for about 3 weeks now and am very impressed by it.  Color and picture is as good as any I have seen in the big box stores.  Only complaint I might have is the remote, but Amazon sells qwerty keyboard remotes for $20 or less and I might try one of those.As far as complaints from others about how long it takes to turn on,I have a 6 or 7 year old Sharp and it takes about that amount of time to come on as well.And complaints about the Internet connectivity, I think a lot of that comes down to your ISP feed speed and router.

It's the first wifi enabled TV I've ever owned and but since I have minimal cable line-up there, I knew I'd be depending heavily on video streaming from Netflix and Amazon. Also, since there is only one HDMI port on this model, I wanted the wifi feature so I could use the HDMI port for a game system rather than a Roku.This is a slim profile television and the stand is one that attaches from the back rather than underneath so it only needs 14 1/2\" headroom. It measures slightly over 22\" wide and about  6 1/2\" deep with the stand attached.The ports on the back of the TV include 1 HDMI port, 1 USB port, 1 RF port, 1 RGB PC port for connecting to a computer or laptop, Composite and Component ports, 1 Ethernet port, a coax cable port, a headphone jack and a 5.1 digital optical jack.It features 1080p resolution and is 60Hz.

I usually prefer a printed owners manual but this actually makes sense as you can't lose it.Vizio has it's own streaming video apps called VIA, just as Roku has \"channels\". There is a VIA button in the center of the remote which brings up an onscreen dock with all the pre-installed apps. You can also add more apps by opening the Yahoo! Connected TV Store App.I believe this TV would be best suited to a bedroom, office or kitchen with a wireless network available and and would be a great solution where there is not much space and no cable television service.

This causes no issues if the TV is viewed at eye level or below, but when the TV is above eye level the angle causes a very significant degradation of perceived image quality.  In my case, I purchased it for the bedroom, and with the TV just a few inches above the bed, the image quality was terrible due to the angle.  My solution was to purchases a $20 tilting wall mount to compensate.2) Only one HDMI input.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best little TV for the price", "Author": "Jason P", "ReviewID": "R27FGAJ6UXXI4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV to hang on the wall in the kitchen using VideoSecu Articulating TV Wall Mount, Full Motion Tilt Swivel and Rotate Articulating Arm for Most 15\" 17\" 19\" 20\" 22\" 23\" 24\" 26\" 27\" LCD LED TV Monitor Flat Panel Screen with VESA 100 ML11B A63.

It fits with room to spare in my 30 inch wide wall units in my small (12 by 20) living room. It is so much smaller than the former Sansui 32 inch CRT it replaced that I bought a one drawer glossy black modular storage drawer unit and put it under the TV to store DVDs, remotes, manuals, etc. The narrow edge design is probably the reason why it is not as wide as other competitor's sets or even other Vizio models with a 31.5 inch screen size. Setup took all of 25 minutes, including doing two scans for digital off-air channels (I assume scanning for cable channels without a box would be similar). I was able to connect my digital HD cable TV converter box (required by my Bright House service for its HD channels and premium channels) using one of the TV's two HDMI ports, then connected my DVD player via the composite RCA female jacks and my amplified off-air antenna to the female coaxial cable/TV port (hence a 32 channel \"backup\" in case the cable goes out). There is also a USB port that allows inserting a flash drive so that you can view photos on the TV. I will be buying a second HDMI cable so that I can connect my HP Pavilion multimedia notebook with a HDMI port to view movies, etc. In addition, this is a Smart HDTV and has several Internet apps already configured, and more can be downloaded. The TV established a connection with my encrypted wireless g/n home network with a \"hidden\" ID without a hitch -- just type in the network name and the WEP key, wait a few seconds, and you are connected for Hulu, Netflix, etc. (no Roku box required). If you want one of these, I suggest you act fast ... I think this model will soon be retired or replaced, and for well less than $300.00, this is clearly an outstanding set for the price.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "great screen", "Author": "Nilufar Baratova \"Nina\"", "ReviewID": "R2RYYUX18R3UYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I simply love that TV.

For the price and a 50 inch tv it is great. The features you get for the value like built in wifi is also great. Picture quality is good. Sound quality sucks. Well then again no flat screen has ggod sound lol so no complaint there. The only real downside to this tv for the first 7 months is the warm-up time. You can take a nap waiting for the tv to turn on. Again this was all acceptable for the price.Now for the disaster. Ive owned this tv for 9 months now. One month ago the Tv began Flickering and having lines going through it bad. Like 50% of the screen. Not all the time. It has its moods. Some days normal. Other days when im already in a bad mood it is as well. You all can relate to that. Anyways I monitored it for a week and then called Vizio as Im under there standard warranty for purchaseing a tv. Well first they make me check this and that power cord etc and nothing worked. Then they went on to the cable box being the issue. So I say my dvd player does it as well. Either way that phone call went no where. Followed there steps being re-assured everything would be ok if we just did things step by step. So I did the cable box and even went as far as to have my cable tech speak with them over the phone while he was here.After finally admitting that it could be one of many different problems like main board, this circuit or that....blah blah it was basically a defect in there tv. So they tell me they will fix it for free. Well heres the real kicker. I have to MAIL the tv back to them. Now two problems. One I live in a small house so i was unable to save the tv box it was shipped in. And two I have to pay to SHIP the tv to them. That is not the kind of service I expect from a company that I just spent 750.00 on one of there products. And if most of you are like me a hard working blue collar person, well you know we can afford a tv of this purchase once every 7 or 8 years. So for now I'm stuck with a tv that flickers whenever it feels like.So please be weary of this Tv or any of vizios tv with that kind of customer support.

Even with our less than spectacular internet connection, and this set being in our bedroom, over 30 feet from the wireless router, and through 3 walls, reception has been spectacular. The picture is twice as good as our 6 yr old Toshiba Regza 42\" set. We use it to stream Netflix content quite a lot, and not only do most shows/movies come through crystal clear, with true color and deep blacks, but Netflix streams about 2x faster than on the larger tv outfitted with a little Magnavox media box, less than  12 feet from the wireless router. The sound quality is acceptable to our ears and another really nice thing is the usb port not only allows movie and personal photo viewing as well as music listening from a flash drive, I discovered that a WD 2 TB external hard drive is recognized and we have the option to play several hundred files from that. Of course it doesn't play all file types, but quite a few. I find the speakers good enough for me to listen to Pandora internet radio in the mornings and to enjoy it. Haven't hooked any periperals up via HDMI as yet, but a DVD player attached to the composite jacks looks excellent, so I imagine the HDMI hook ups should only be better.  If I had one small criticism of this tv it would be the remote is a bit clunky and when pressing the buttons its not as smooth as many others. Button pushes make an audible click, but it does work. This unit only came with a 90 day 3rd party warranty, being a refurb, so I will update this review if there are any changes in performance or our feelings toward it, but so far this is the best set I've ever owned, by a wide margin, and I'll be taking a hard look at the 47\" Vizio when it comes time to replace our Toshiba.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst TV ever for streaming", "Author": "Lucia Fedina", "ReviewID": "R2BI5YLELTG91J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The TV has many problems.

When the Amazon button is pressed, nothing happens. By contrast, when the Netflix button is pressed, full Netflix functionality is present.Secondly, when Amazon is accessed thru the Vizio VIA app, there is no access to Amazon Prime features such as Watchlist, Recently Watched, etc. available thru your Amazon Prime account.  This is the case even though one has to authorize VIA with Amazon the same way other streaming devices such as Roku get authorized. However, the only thing one can easily do is watch content recommended by Amazon. For anything else, you have to search for the content, which is very cumbersome. Even after you find shows you can't save them in any way. This is ok I guess for movies but clearly not for TV series.A quick internet search will show that this is a long-standing issue that Vizio and Amazon have failed to address despite being contacted directly by many users and the issue being posted on Amazon user forums and reviews. This was my first and last Vizio purchase and I cannot recommend that anyone should buy any Vizio internet enabled TV product.

But I will tell there a few things to be aware of.  This is only a \"720p\" and not the standard \"1080p\" definition most TV's are today.  The second thing I noticed while reviewing this TV it that it only has to 2 HDMI outputs.  This could be an issue for you if you will have alot of things plugging into it.  But with all that said I have had some great looking 720p TV's and this TV is under $300 dollars.  So I still would recommend it.2 years ago you could not even dream about getting a 32 inch LED Smart TV for under $300 dollars, times have definitely changed.  This review will act as a guide as well as a review for this VIZIO.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to youNow first thing when a TV says its LED that is very similar to LCD.  The main difference with this type of TV is the way the lighting within the TV is done.  LED is back-lit better so that their are no dark spots on the screen.  The term SMART TV means this TV has the ability to directly connect to the internet.  But what makes a TV a smart TV is its ability to connect all of your devices together.  The Smart TV is the train conductor that can push content from your DVD's, game systems, and other devices to the TV.The next step is to look at the features that are offered with the TV. Here are some offered by this VIZIO Smart TV:SMART TV Internet Apps this TV has built-in Wi-Fi which allows you to watch internet content like Netflix, rent movies through the TV.  Pretty much whatever you can do on your computer you can do on this TV.- With LED backlighting the pops with rich color and vivid details.- This LED HDTV is up to 50% more energy efficient than conventional LCD HDTVs to save money.- The slim frame design for this VIZIO lets you maximize your space, allowing you to fit a bigger screen size TV in the same space.- Here is the input/Output layout: 2 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 Composite (shared with component), RF Connector for Internal Tuner, 1 Ethernet, and 1 USB 2.0.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT DEAF FRIENDLY", "Author": "Bond, James Bond", "ReviewID": "R2A776ZOCWTH3A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is our first HD TV and we are freaking loving it!

However, I began to have problems with the TV where it would freeze up. After sending the TV back in and having the wireless card replaced, I found that the TV still has the same issue, freezing up to the point where you would have to turn the TV off and back on again. After multiple hours of time spent with customer support, I was told that there was an incompatibility issue with my wireless network such that it caused the TV to lock up. I was told that I would have to either disable my WiFi network (then what would deb the point of an internet TV) or disable the Network or File sharing function of my WiFi network. I was also told that it may have something to do with how the TV is not DLNA compatible. I have a standard out-of-the-box network from an Apple Airport Extreme, nothing fancy. I wouldn't know how to set up anything fancy with my network anyway. I spoke with Vizio by phone and email more times than I care to count. I was hoping to exchange my TV for a model that would not have the WiFi issues, but apparently I am told that all their TVs have the same WiFi card AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO HAVING THE SAME LOCKUP ISSUE! I was told that I am not alone in having this issue. So while having to deal with repeating the same story over three months to various support reps, getting the voicemail of a manager who takes over a week to return a voicemail, overall I have to rate the whole experience of owning a Vizio as abysmal. I'm still trying to troubleshoot the issue with a different manager, who has shot down my proposal to exchange my model for a newer one in the hopes that it resolves my WiFi issue.

I bought this to replace a bedroom TV (not a Vizio; a Magnavox). The picture is great and it does a good job in automatically adjusting the aspect ratio for different channels. The sound is quite satisfactory for a small TV. The front-firing speakers clinched my decision (as they did on my slightly older Vizio). Most TVs today have rear-firing speakers (I suppose so the electronics companies can subsequently sell auxiliary speakers for $120 or more). Having speakers fire against the living room wall is just silly. The only thing I don't like is the stand, which is a simple lean-to. \"Swivel\" is unnecessary for such a lightweight TV, but \"tilt\" to change the viewing angle would have been good. Unfortunately, the old TV's stand would not work as it had a different VESA hole placement. I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a smaller TV - great price. Setting up the WiFi is a snap. Interesting to note that the Netflix interface on this TV is slightly different and a tad friendlier that the Netflix app on the slightly older Vizio. I use Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon.Edit on 3/6/14: I saw my review showed up for this TV in a listing by vendor One Stop Shop.

Until this problem occurred, the TV reception was outstanding, pulling in about 20 local channels, of which seven were in crystal clear high definition.  The TV also produced very good video from an up converting DVD player connected through the HDMI input.  Setting up the wireless function was quick and easy and I enjoyed listening to music through Pandora.Putting aside the catastrophic failure of the OTA TV reception, my only complaint with this TV lies with the small built-in speakers - the audio sounds tinny and anemic.  This, however, is not a major issue for me since I have a small home theater system connected to the TV through the TV's headphone jack.  The TV also has a digital optical output jack, but my inexpensive home theater receiver lacks a digital audio input, so I get stereo audio from the TV through the left and right front speakers in the home theater systemWhen I encountered the problem with no TV reception, I immediately called Amazon's technical support.  The tech rep suggested several possible fixes, most of which I had already tried and when it became obvious that there was a major problem that could not be resolved over the telephone, the tech rep arranged for a free exchange for a new TV.  Fortunately, I was still within Amazon's 30 day return period on my original purchase.  I just received the new TV today and it is working properly.  I will supplement this report as I get further use with the replacement.This 24 inch Smart HD TV offers a lot of bang for the buck and I am hoping the replacement unit, unlike the original, gives me many years of use.  If you purchase this TV, or for that matter any other electronic product, from Amazon, my suggestion is that you give it a heavy workout during the first 30 days.

This TV has a impressive picture, especially when you hook it up using the HDMI cable for max resolution and calrity. Component cable is not that bad looking, if that is all you have and don't want to buy additional cables, but would recommend the HDMI cable. Wasn't expecting the built in speakers to have nice sound but it does, it has different modes(rock, jazz, classical like on a stereo or ipod, it even has a sound equalizer. This TV has a lot of features and several picture and sound modes, but the picture has a custom mode if you don't want to use any of the predetermine modes you can adjust the TV manually.Amazon shipped this out quick and arrived, it good condition ordered it on a Saturday night it came on Tuesday.I was concerned before receiving this because I didn't get the Samsung and Vizio is the lesser manufacturer, but heard some good things about Vizio in the past, so this also helped my final decision I am so glad I did I am very happy with it so far.

No issues streaming Netflix, Vudu, or the other sites.Unlike most small flat screen TVs with a tilting stand, this particular model comes with a fixed angle table top stand, in which the best viewing quality will be if the TV height is lower than eye level. In my case, I initially set the TV on top of a 5 ft tall chest of drawers to be viewed in essentially a prone position below the TV. Needless to say, the picture quality as a result of this viewing angle was poor. I resolved this issue by replacing the supplied fixed table mount with a tilt/swivel wall mount, and mounting the TV to the wall.

Happily, the 29\" model comes with 5 watt speakers, and while it's not exactly a theater experience, the sound is adequate and improved in comparison to the 24\".This set is otherwise impressive for the price. It starts up quickly, gets a strong signal from my router, and has an impressive amount of apps. It's light, the picture is crisp, in short it checks nearly every box you want for a web enabled TV. The tilted base on this series remains strange, and because the set has limited viewing angles, it's a problem for many, so I give it 4 rather than 5 stars.

I bought the 39-inch model because my living room is tiny, and it's just about the perfect size for my viewing distance. The built-in apps are all you really need but you can add and delete apps (yes, it's actually possible to delete the useless Yahoo apps). You do have to sign up for the Yahoo app store but that's painless. I had no trouble at all getting the TV to recognize my WiFi network, and connecting it to Netflix and Amazon Prime couldn't be easier.The slim-bezel design ensures that none of the picture gets cut off. Of the brands I shopped before buying this TV and experience with friends' TVs, Vizio and Samsung seem to be the best at not chopping the bottom of the screen off. Panasonic and LG cut off a significant portion of the picture on all sides, and Magnavox cuts off quite a bit too.TV reception is solid, the tuner has all the latest DTV technology and it has no trouble with my indoor antenna. Fast-motion shots in football games can be problematic if your local station has any sub-channels eating up their bandwidth but as long as the source signal isn't compressed too much you won't notice any artifacts. Picture quality is incredibly sharp and the built-in speakers are all most people will ever need but it does support external audio devices if you are a surround-sound aficionado.The coolest thing about the Amazon Prime app is that while you're searching on the left side of the screen for the video you want to watch, the live TV picture scales down to the remaining 75% of the screen on the right so you can browse for the latest Downton Abbey episodes while your local meteorologist talks about the weather. Of the video-streaming apps on this TV, the Amazon Prime app is the best.Netflix comes in a close second. Navigation is easy and video quality is second to none, as long as the video is available for 720p or 1080p. Some TV shows that were produced in HD are only available on NF in 480p resolution, but the TV handles those well. I was actually surprised when I was watching a David Tennant-era Doctor Who episode and the TV reported that it was only receiving a 480p stream from NF.The YouTube app is kind of clunky but when it's playing videos it plays them back without any problems, and you can sign in to your YouTube account so you can use the website to find videos and put them in your Watch Later list, then get to them from the TV without having to deal with the app's search function.The only app I was disappointed with was Hulu Plus. The video was washed out, and the sound was tinny. I hooked up the Xbox and played the same video using that Hulu app and the video and sound quality were great, so this is a fault with the Hulu Plus app for Vizio. I contacted Hulu support and they were not helpful. Most of what I wanted to watch they still don't have rights to stream to TV or mobile devices so I canceled my free trial anyway. Therefore the Hulu app's shortcomings are a non-issue for me. If you want to use Hulu and have a game console or other streaming device, use that for Hulu, not the TV's Hulu app.The media player app can stream videos, music and photos from your PC running media-streaming software such as TVersity. Combined with Windows Media Center (free) and a TV tuner card, I've made this my DVR.This is by far the best TV I have ever owned.

My Nexus 7, iPhone, and laptop all get good reception using the same streaming apps from the same spot, but the Vizio TV either cannot connect or the connections constantly drop out.

I know many times I'll cut the TV on in the morning or while my kid is sleeping on the couch and I mute it because it's so loud, but it's still going to be loud when I turn it down, but with this TV I don't have that problem.* The apps pop up on the side when you select them and you can size your screen to where it doesn't cut it off while you're looking for something.* The slim frame makes it seem as if it's floating in the dark, you feel like you're at the theater.Picture:The quality is extremely good with HDMI, the streaming through WI-FI, and an antenna. With sports there is a big difference in this and the 60 hz, plus it has settings to make it even better. It takes a while for it to come on (compared to other TV's) as others have said, but honestly, why is everyone in such a hurry for their TV to come on? Are you really that impatient to where you can't wait 60 secs for TV when you're probably going to watch at least 30 mins?Apps:The only ones I really use are the Netflix and Amazon. Netflix is laid out the same as my PS3 and I like that, but it does seem to buffer slower and takes a while to get a clear  picture. The Amazon app, doesn't have a place to select your watchlist (that I've found) so you have to search or dig for anything you want to watch. I'll probably use my PS3 more for Amazon, but it is convenient to not have to turn on a separate device. Youtube works good playing from the phone most of the time and I really like that feature. I'll update on other apps once I've used more, but haven't had a chance or need yet.Antenna:It was easy to set up and scan for channels and the picture quality was amazing, not to mention I get better reception with it. It actually tells you what is on local channels, how long it will be on, and gives a short description, just like cable or satellite would.Sound:This is one spot where the TV doesn't hold up well against others. The sound isn't terrible it's just not great. I will definitely invest in a sound bar as soon as I can. The speakers are on the bottom BTW. UPDATE: If you change the sound from Surround to standard it sounds much less distorted and is still plenty loud enough.Stand:I used a wall mount, but the stand seemed very solid and was very heavy so I think it would have done just fine.Remote:I like the convenience of the Netflix button and Amazon Prime button and the buttons are easy to read and it's laid out fairly well. It's small and light and points very easily. You can have it facing any where near the TV and it will work.Hook ups:The hook ups are easy to get to on the side (which is good if you want to plug something in temporarily like a phone or computer) and even though the ones that are facing downward are hard to reach it makes it where if you're mounting to the wall you can get it very flush. There are more than enough hook ups to fit just about anyone's needs.Overall, I couldn't find a TV that beat this one for the features and price and I couldn't be happier.

Why is Amazon now combining all kinds of different size and model Vizio TVs in this single review thread? This is a disservice to users. It is confusing and inefficient.===========================================================================This 29 inch Vizio TV is the perfect size for viewing when the TV is sitting just beyond the foot-of-the-bed. The slim profile and light weight makes it easy to fit into tighter spaces without sacrificing quality or comfortable viewing.The TV is capable of remarkable color and clarity. However, it did take me a while to customize the settings for optimal color and picture quality. The default setup does not reflect the picture potential that is available with careful tweaking.My personal preference (your mileage/taste may vary):Advanced Picture -> Color Enhancement -> GM/BlueAdvanced Picture -> Luma -> MediumAdvanced Picture -> Backlight Control -> OffColor Temperature -> CoolPicture Mode -> Custom-- backlight -> 41-- brightness -> 37-- contrast -> 42-- color -> 51-- tint -> -2-- sharpness -> 10The remote control (RC-29\") took some getting used to. I often like to control with \"feel\" instead of sight. Since the RC-29\" thickness is uniform and the top and bottom are both rounded, it is easy to grab the remote in the dark and not know immediately whether you are holding it from the top or bottom. In contrast, the RC from my other Vizio 16\" TV is, in most respects, more ergonomic. The RC-16\" was longer so buttons were more spread out and easier to locate in the dark. The RC-16\" also had a smooth battery bump on the back, making it much easier to determine top and bottom in the dark. I would have just used the old RC-16\" to control my 29\" Vizio except that the RC-29\" had channel numbers at the very bottom, making it easier to select channels by \"feel\" than via the RC-16\".I also use a tiny $60 Android/TV box about the size of a fat harmonica that connects to one of the two Vizio HDMI ports. It gives me full internet web access (via wi-fi) and access to plenty of great apps, essentially a small Android 4.2.2 computer using the TV as a 1280x720 pixel monitor. Although this box is capable of being powered by the Vizio USB port, I prefer to use an external powered USB hub. My favorite app is the XBMC media player allowing me to easily access, via wi-fi, my notebook's USB hard drive's 1TB of movies, MP3s, and various other media files.LINK: hypercube.us/forum/index.php?topic=1202.0The Vizio E291i-A1 29 inch HDTV would be a great deal even without its wi-fi capabilities.

I know some reviewers like not having the TV mounted on a pedestal, but I find that the back brace \"stand\" is somewhat unstable. It also forces the screen itself to point slightly upward.  I am probably going to need to buy something to elevate the TV half a foot or so above the table top it sits on since I didn't anticipate not having that extra 6\" that a pedestal stand would have given me.  I did find a couple of inexpensive table top stands for small flat screens, but the ones that mount the TV to vertical rails are probably out of the question since directly below the mounting screw holes in the TV are the HDMI and component video inputs. These sockets would be blocked by the rails.Then there is the sound.  In a word, awful. It sounds as bad as any tinny set of PC speakers built into a 20\" monitor.Finally (and this is minor I'll admit) is the time it takes the TV to start showing broadcast TV when it is first turned on (at least 15 seconds) and the time it takes to display the previous channel when switching back and forth (around 3 seconds).", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Another Great Vizio", "Author": "GrapevineGrammie", "ReviewID": "R1JCRRE7G1Q1P1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our family has 10 vizio's of different sizes among us (3 families) and no disappointments yet.

I've been pretty happy with my purchase. There a few things I don't like, but overall, it is a pretty good bargain. For less than $200 I was able to get an HD TV that has built in Netflix and Amazon Prime. This saved me having to buy a Roku or similar device just for these two features. The quality of the picture I get with Netflix is excellent. The quality of the picture I get with my Dish Network receiver is not quite so good, but then again, my Dish receiver set up remotely to the primary tv and only the first tv gets HD, the second is in SD, which is a whole separate issue. I'd have to add a Hopper to get HD on the second set. The screen size for normal viewing is not 24\" and while you can select three other settings, I find this feature really annoying. I leave it in the \"normal\" viewing size because the \"wide\" \"panoramic\" and \"zoom\" settings add slight distortions to the picture. Netflix comes up in full screen size, so I'm really not sure what the deal is with that. The other thing I'm not too crazy about is the matte finish (versus glossy) picture screen. I thought I might like it, but when I compare it to my Samsung 50\" I realize that I guess I really do prefer a glossy picture. However, the bottom line is that I still feel like it was a good deal for the money. I really didn't want to spend more for a second tv that gets limited use anyway. If I could afford to spend twice as much money, I would get something else, but I'm really happy with the tv and would buy it again.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "VIZIO screwed up on the Amazon Application", "Author": "Kaylee Brown", "ReviewID": "R34W0WEMT647R0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased TV and am happy with it as a whole, except one thing.

As I recall, to attached the TV base/stand to the TV you need a Phillips screwdriver with a #1 blade/tip and a shank of over one inch (to fit thru the opening in the base). I started the two screws in the TV to condition the threads, unscrewed them, snapped the base into the TV, stood the TV on edge on a bed (mattress), and put in the screws. With this approach it was easy. We used free shipping from Amazon, but the TV arrived at least a week before the original estimate. The TV comes with a Quick Start Guide which is adequate. We downloaded the manual from Vizio. We had tried first to buy this Vizio model from a big box store, and they sold us a TV in a box that looked unopened.

My mother in law, (it's her tv) noted how crisp and clear it was for her, and started to chuckle at how much detail it revealed of the local tv anchors.  I was impressed at how bright the tv was.  We both very much liked the on screen controls. She particularly liked the ability to label the inputs with user friendly names (Cable, Roku, Blu Ray) which had bedeviled her on her older tv.  The remote was friendly, and the tv played nice with her Verizon Fios cable box.The only minor criticism I have is the wireless seemed a bit flaky.  I could not get the Amazon app to load. This wasn't a big deal, and is something we will play with over time.  She generally prefers the Roku box and we didn't dwell on troubleshooting.The four hdmi ports are generous.

The speaker is pretty cheap.  Don't expect movie theater sound quality out of the speakers.  You could get a sound bar as a alternative. The remote works fine, but the buttons feel cheap.  No big deal.  I do wish you could program special buttons. Example:  There is a button on the remote for Netflix and it takes you to netflix, but if you want to go directly in to pandora, there is no button and you can't program one of the buttons for pandora.  Again, not a big deal, but would be a nice to have feature.So if you are looking for a decent TV with a ton of internet options, this is a great buy.

The on-screen keyboard is not difficult to use, but does take more time to use than would a QWERTY keyboard.Setting up this TV takes about five minutes because everything is easy to locate and access.  Plugging in the cable or antenna is easy (mine is a coax cable), and so is plugging in the HDMI cable for a DVD player.  While I do not have my Wii set up on this television, I can see how easy it would be (the attachments are very accessible).UPDATE, 10.20.13-- I have reduced my rating by one star because of an issue that is arising more and more often now.  When I push the button for Amazon, the TV more often than not just \"spins\" as it is \"loading\" Amazon.  It can \"spin\" for an hour or more before it finally loads.  Pushing exit or turning off the TV and turning it back on doesn't solve the issue.  This is happening more and more often, and it is VERY annoying.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice picture and good features", "Author": "RayZar", "ReviewID": "R3M3BTKU5N2NBM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Set up the smart tv pretty effortlessly for amazon and Netflix.

I wanted a smart TV (so I could use my PS3 in the man cave) and did not want to purchase a roku or apple tv if i could get most of the same features in one purchase. This is by far the cheapest 47\" smart TV on the market! I was like most a little nervous about the apps, as that was the only reason i purchased this particular one. I read the picture needed adjustment, but to be honest I havent touched any screen settings and I think the picture quality out of the box is rather nice. I ran into an issue when it came to the apps though. Like many stated when you cut the tv on (which takes at least 20s to boot up) the apps are slow to pop up. I think it has to establish internet connection each time. After being on for a minute however it works just fine. My issue came when trying to watch a movie. Netflix worked great and loaded faster than i thought it would, but after 10min of viewing it froze and tried to reload and would just freeze. I thought it was just the internet and it was fine so I tried another app. Youtube worked fine and Hulu worked. Tried Netflix again and after 10min it did the same thing. I then tried a long youtube video and oddly enough it froze at 10min and the same with Hulu. So I called vizio and was excited to hear an american voice so that was a plus! After talking with them for an hour and trying multiple steps they still had no idea what was causing it. So we did a restart by holding the power button for 2min with the tv unplugged and on their end they did something with registering my tv on their server again. Since then (crossfingers) it has worked perfectly with no complaints. I will update in a few weeks, but expect good things from this great priced Item! for sure reccommend it!", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad utube app??", "Author": "arizona", "ReviewID": "R329EL5WNP4QUN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took a chance and bought [thru amazon] one of the first [e500i-a1] in december 2012. After 7 months of use with this I have tried many of the apps and have used many of the tv functions. No major problems/complaints except for the utube app. It is constantly buffering giving unusable audio/vidio [most of the time]. It does seem to run better at certain times of the day. I have called vizio support several times but they said there is nothing more they can do and suggested it was an utube problem of some sort? I use cox cable with more than enough bandwidth. I have tried it on 2 different modems [at vizio's suggestion I even tried a direct LAN connection to the e500i-a1 from the modem thereby eliminating any router/wifi/cabling/etc problems]. I have tried most of the other vidio apps such as hulu,vudu/etc and all work without problems. The utube app has no picture quality setting for streaming/etc [like when using utube on a computer] so its hard to say what the app does [except its not good]. The utube rev level presently is v1.0.2 and all the utube vidios that I have tried on the e500i-a1 run without problem [at max. quality level setting] on all my 3 computers [even when streaming to all 3 at the same time].

The initial set-up was easy as well.Bottom line:  Want an inexpensive \"smart\" TV?  This fits the bill for sure.  Do I miss the PICTURE quality of my SONY?  You bet!  Will I buy another SONY?

But I've owned other HDTV's before and the picture on this was absolutely beautiful.  My only reason for not giving it a 5 star is I was disappointed by how slow the apps operate and the lack of options on the apps themselves.  That might be because of the way the apps were written by their respective makers.  But for instance the amazon app doesn't let you sort through the free movies you pay for through PRIME by genre.  And Hulu Plus has very limited browsing options.  You can always do searches if you know the exact show you're looking for but the operations are clunky and slow and take a while to process.  While I understand it's not a cell phone its not very much data being transmitted to have a list of movies and a few pictures.  I can put up with some load times for high data HD movies but the awkward slow apps just can make it rather frustrating.  You can spend 30 minutes just looking for something to watch on an app and that's simply a waste of time.In spite of this I'd still give the T.V. a good rating.  It plays movies brilliantly and the sound is much better than you would expect.  The sound is great for average viewing and movies.

It's got a GREAT picture, but as many people have said, has a disappointing sound system.  This can easily be corrected by adding a sound board or hooking the set up through your current stereo system.The \"Smart\" TV is really a waste of money.  If you think you will have a web browser, YOU WON'T.  You must go through the apps listed on the TV.  But, there's another problem.  When using these apps, you go into a different part of the site.  For example on hulu, you can find a lot of old series that you can watch without charge through your computer.  But, when you use your app on the TV, you are prompted to join hulu and don't get access to any of the free stuff they offer.The same held true with YouTube.  When I went through my computer and put in a musician's name, over 100 videos came up to choose from.  But, when I entered the same info from the app on my TV, only 20 videos came up.This isn't the fault of the TV, I have to admit.  In a few years when technology catches up with itself, the smart feature may work better.  In the meantime, you get TONS more programming to watch by hooking this TV up to your computer instead.I need to replace another TV and I would absolutely buy a VIZIO again, but NOT with the SMART feature.

(Honestly if you have a room so large, or so many people over to watch your television that this is an issue, you probably have the wrong size anyway... I have the 50 inch and it's perfect.All of the settings are very easy to access, and if you follow the previous recommendations for settings, you should find the quality of the picture quite pleasing.

I'm coming from a 5 yr. old high end Samsung CCFL LCD for comparison.  The BF price was low but not worth the poor picture so I returned it.Out of the box, the calibration was way off.  Skin looked pink and green.  After some calibration, good blacks and colors vs. the old Samsung.  I wanted a new TV to get better blacks and this had it.  Turn off those horrible coloring and contrast shifting options - they change the picture consistency too much.  Colors: A-, Blacks: AThe Vizio looked slightly softer side by side - the old TV appeared to be a tiny bit sharper when pixel peeping.  Nothing too noticeable in casual viewing so not a big deal, I don't know why.  Appearance of sharpness: B+The bad: Backlight: F.  It was reasonably bright but it had some major issues: major vignetting, (dark shadows in the 4 corners) - if you go to the local big box store, you will see vignetting on some displays.  This effect can be fun on your instagram selfie, horrible on a TV.  This should be an auto F but there was more.This display also had a very inconsistent backlight.  I don't know how they make something so simple so bad.  My old TV has very consistent diffusing of the backlight and it uses old school CCFL lamps.  Backlit LED are supposed to have local dimming and no \"flashlight\" or clouding effect that some edge lit LED have.  It wasn't too noticeable during the day but during night, there was clearly a thin white glow at the very top, lighter vertical bands on the right side, and lighter cloudy areas on the left side.  On a black screen like credits, between commercials, or dark scenes, this was clearly visible.Motion blur: C.  Noticeable but it seems like most LCD at this price point are about the same.The base mount does not swivel but was sturdy enough.  No real problems there or with overall build quality.  It was a plastic shell-I judge on picture not the case.Sound is better than expected but not anything special, C+.  My old TV's speakers sounded like voices were coming out of a tin can.  These sounded way better but obviously not close to a soundbar.  Don't buy a flat screen expecting good sound so C is average for these.

I wanted a \"smart\" TV to eliminate multiple remote controls laying around (Roku & TV & Digital Conveter Box, old TV was a tube job). After much research, this Vizio is the only 32\" smart TV that would fit (barely). I prefer Samsung but their 32\" set is about an inch wider and would not fit the space. The only 32\" TV I found that is narrower is the JVC EMT32 and that is only about an eighth of an inch narrower and is not a smart TV. Dropping to a 29\" set would have been too small. We have had for several weeks now. Good picture quality. The speakers sound very tinny and annoying. Played with the audio settings several times, still can not get a decent sound from them. Too little bass and too much treble. Have wired into home stereo system with the RCA jacks and can play TV audio through that if we want and it sounds much better. The 720p picture is fine for this size set. I do not feel we are compromising there. As others state, the remote is small but I don't mind the size. What I do mind is that the buttons \"click\" when you push them. If you are channel surfing,this gets old. No need for an audible confirmation that I pushed the button. The wireless feature was not working well for us due to router about 30 feet away on a different floor in our home. Roku box had no issue at same distance. I have since run an ethernet cable from router through walls/ceiling to the TV directly and the Netflix streaming is fine now (no different than with the Roku wirelessly). Have added a few extra channels through the app store and they are fine (Mostly use Netflix but also Crackle).  I fired Verizon pay TV and we use antenna and streaming. The free TV via antenna is broadcast in hi-def 720 and 1080 by the major stations and looks great on this set.  Summary: Crappy speakers, noisy remote and weak wireless, everything else is fine. If flawless wireless performance is important to you, you might want to pass.

I was excited to find that my logitech wireless keyboard worked in the USB slot!  So, if anyone is struggling with keying in WiFi passwords, or having trouble typing search terms in Netflix, plug in a keyboard.  I have a small logitech that I keep on the night stand next to my bed.The picture looks great.. I used to be a videophile, but this is just a bedroom TV.. so I'm not fiddling with it too much.  The audio sounds a little thin to me... but  I may just be used to my livingroom setup with the 12\" subwoofer. ;)The menus on the TV are sluggish... at best.  It takes several seconds after pushing \"Netflix\" for the app to open up.  Pretty annoying, really.  You would think, after having smart TV's around for so long that someone would have improved on the interface of these things.  The menus seemed laid out for a larger TV, also.. some of the fonts are hard for me to read from 10' away.  I find myself squinting a lot.I was excited to find you can stream media to this thing via a media server on your PC!  Using Universal Media Server ([...]) or something similar, you can stream videos, photos, and music to this TV! Very cool.  Again.. the interface is sluggish... and it's hard to read file names from any significant distance.  Also.. it's finicky about what video codecs it wants to play.  It'll play .avi's just fine, it seems.. but will give me a codec error on some .mp4's but not others... so, I'll have to fiddle with it more to see what works and what doesn't.Overall, I'm happy with it.

The Vizio is a decent starter smart TV that has mediocre picture quality. At first look the TV looks like a Winner the design is great. If you want to design a room buy the vizio just dont turn it on. The sound is average and The smart Apps are okay but nothing to brag about. I purchased this TV at Dell for $599 to replace my 2yr old Sony EX700 and thought i was getting a great deal BIG MISTAKE.  The TV has a WIFI that has no on or off switch which means it will take up bandwidth in your house when the TV is on. I called Vizio and asked if there was a on off switch and the agent told me the only way i could turn off the WIFI was to reset to factory settings That was the first turn off. Next the picture clarity on the TV is average at best for a LED. The blacks are not dark and true and there is a constant blurr when watching. If i had to rate this TV on a scale of 1-10 my rating would be a 5. Bottom line if you do not want to spend alot of money on a TV the vizio is the way to go. If you are like me and you want quality, performance and durability spend the extra money and buy a Samsung or a Sony.

Once they have your money their consideration for your business goes down to the drain!!!! You will be left alone to fend for yourself!  Like me now, no TV and my money is gone!!!!
