Very user Friendly and is very good marketing tool for bars, clubs, and restuarants. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone. The cost is NO different that a regular LED or LCD screen. You don't have to advertise if you don't want to, with a click you are back to a full size screen for regular tv. I have 3 of them, 2 32s and 1 37 all behind the bar. The 37 is great, the 42 inch is too big for my application, but by no means short yourself square inches if you don't have to. LG makes a very good product, don't be scared of these. I also have 2 47 inch 3Ds as well and I will be buying more LG's in the future for my expansion of my bar and restaurant. There you have it. Feel free contact me for more info. hullslanding@windstream.net", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Impressed", "Author": "gprimr1", "ReviewID": "R17I5PTROYHJ23", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am not impressed with this unit, and I wish I could have returned it but I didn't get to dig into it until after the return date.My issues:1.) The LG Templates are very limited.2.) There is no way to create your own template or edit the provided templates.3.) This unit is NOT Wi-Fi Enabled.4.) You cannot play a photo slideshow with the EZ Sign content on.5.) You can only play 10MB worth of easysign content.If LG wants to improve this1.) Add Wifi2.) Release a template designer app3.) Allow more than 10MB to be played if playing from USBAlso: Do not plug anything into the Ethernet port on the back. It is NOT an Ethernet port, it is a Remote Jack Pack port and will destroy any network equipment it's plugged into.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "My screen is not sharp", "Author": "myrna skeen", "ReviewID": "R2TTP5Y7VFDM8I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am not too happy with the screen picture on my LG Electronics 32LD452B 32-Inch 60Hz LCD TV (2011 Model). I tried to make the adjustments on the program screen and I check the preset that the TV came with but is not a clear or give a sharp picture on all the channels. My old TV shows a sharper picture.Can you tell me if there is anything that I need to do to make the picture brighter and sharper?If not, then I would like to exchange it and get a different TV if possible.I hope for your response.Thanks, Myrna Skeen", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG EZSign is VERY Limited", "Author": "Sami", "ReviewID": "RTT9H8YQQNH0S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The LG EZSign software included with this TV is very limiting, and it is difficult to find a work-around.  As another reviewer mentioned, it only comes with a certain number of templates, and you cannot create new ones.  The templates hardly allow for any customization, rendering them practically useless.  You can only put a picture where there is already a picture on the template, and you can only put text where there is already text.  You cannot adjust the size or position of either of these elements, and you can not change any aspect of the main design/color scheme.I needed a large space to list clients visiting our company, and the only template that fulfills this need is dark and relatively unprofessional.  I attempted to work around that by using another template with a large picture area, and putting my list on an image I created myself - Unfortunately, after about an hour, the slideshow flips around, covering half my custom image, AND changes the color scheme.  I cannot change or disable this transition.  For now, I am stuck re-starting it every hour.Additionally, the TV does not recognize PowerPoint files via USB.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Native Display Resolution 1366 x 768\n2 HDMI inputs with HDCP V.1.3 with deep color\nDynamic Contrast Ratio 60,000:1\nResponse Time (G to G) 4ms", "Name": "LG Electronics 32LD452B 32-Inch 60Hz LCD TV (2011 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ai9R3GXdL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00539PSIW"}}
