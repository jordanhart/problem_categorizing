I can't complain about anything other than the screen seems to get darker all of a sudden but that could just be me. It has great quality picture. The volume can be turned up very loud which is a plus for me since my last TV could be all the way up and still hard to hear. The audio quality isn't the best, but it isn't terrible. Overall, I am very happy. Great gaming and movie watching TV with lots of options.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV But Beware!!", "Author": "Papa Al", "ReviewID": "R1FTP71N3EEK1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is great for the $412 I paid for it on Amazon. The picture and sound are good but if you hook up a DVD recorder to record a program a nuisance warning pops up for about 10 seconds that the TV can't find the HDCP signal. I googled it and it seems Intel put a chip in the TV to restrict recording in High Definition.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost 2 yrs old and still good as new!!", "Author": "astro_mike", "ReviewID": "R30JAOWIB3GYKF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a big fan of Philips brand appliances and this television has not disappointed! It has a GREAT picture for being just 60Hz, far away scenes can appear a tad grainy at times but close ups are extremely CLEAR, true 1080p HD quality and the overall picture quality in general is top notch! The picture quality is even great if your watching tv from the side! This tv also shines when watching blu-ray movies from it with the 3 HDMI outlets it has,  it also has a USB outlet if you want to attach your laptop to it. If you are a budget minded person like me and ditched cable for netflix, you will also enjoy decent (free) digital tv if you add a 10.00 Philips rabbit ears antenna (also available at amazon/Walmart) when you use the auto programming option. The sound is good and loud for me, I usually have it no higher then 40 out of 100 which is fairly loud. I don't know why people need to have such loud volume? Of course I live in a tiny apartment by myself so maybe that's why I don't need it too loud lol. This tv is also an Energy Star rated appliance in case your wondering too. Like I said this tv is still good as new and it's going on 2 years and I am very satisfied and haven't had any problems what so ever with it!", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv for the price", "Author": "jn-baltimore", "ReviewID": "ROC93I70KOXXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have no complaints about this TV.

We have been calling for the Manufacturer\u2019s Warranty since then and there has still been no answer. They asked us for the original receipt. We sent it to them, and still, after many long phone calls, they have not done anything about it. I would suggest, for anyone buying a Philips product, to be very careful, as they do not stand by their products.We even bought the square trade warranty from Amazon, and they haven\u2019t even taken care of the issue either, saying that it is the manufacturer\u2019s responsibility.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Complaining", "Author": "Tee \"trendonite\"", "ReviewID": "R28XIBJ51VPSAS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased on Woot. I would give it four stars if the audio was just slightly better. The remote is also ugly, if you will allow for nitpicking.Otherwise, screen quality is very good, menus are neat, and I am overall happy.

They were easy to get a hold of and help me resolve this issue immediately. They even paid for the shipping costs to return the product. I was also offered a 10% discount which was very generous of them. I just decided that I didn't want to take the risk of going through this same situation again. I don't blame the seller for the broken TV I am sure when it was shipped it was in perfect condition. I guess it should of had a little more padding.

It has 3 HDMI connections, which suffices for my needs.A nice feature would be the ability to play movies from the USB port, but for the money, it does the most important thing.

This tv worked fine for the first 6 months or so then the analog channels went south. Every other tv in the house works fine with no problems. An 8 year old SONY 48\" and a 10 year old 46\" SHARP. I had the cable co. come out to check my signal and they said there end was fine. I know there is something wrong in the Philips tuner but there service department says its my connection (BULL CRAP) First they told me to get a cable booster now there saying I need to rent a cable box. If this tv had any value I would donate it to charity but I think it would cause me grief that I passed along my problems. Get any other brand and you wont have to deal with there service department.
