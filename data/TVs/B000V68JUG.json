The warranty is 90 days parts and labor and 1 year parts so in order to fix the set I will have to shell out more than I paid for it in labor costs.  Currently pleading with support to pay for the labor since it's only 1 month out of warranty.", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Nice", "Author": "Me", "ReviewID": "R1E8ZC4KLMC5QJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll put this here because I'm not subscribing to some goofy forum just to give a review, and all the Verizon Fios customers are trying to figure out what's up.  They are giving these away free with their service bundle, but can tell you nothing, I mean nothing.  They don't have to because people are willing to walk on coals to sign up.  Straight scoop, picture is great on this tv.  All the options in the world, so you have to mess with the setup a bit.  Hint: choose picture option vivid.  Fios is way good enough, standard without HD, on this 19\".  I say save your HD money for the big screen set.  Hooked up Phillips 5982 DVD 1080i upconverter to this, $59.  Way cool resolution and picture.  Check out the reviews on that.  Also, the sound truly is inadequate, but not a problem, because every 19\" is way inadequate.  No worries.  It has a headphone mini jack output in the back.  It also has optical audio out in the back, but that is way overkill for a 19\".  Back to the mini jack.  Hooked up Cambridge Soundworks, $79, oh my my.  You can hook up any PC speakers to this.  Went direct, no additional volume control needed.  You control the sound through your blaster.  It cuts off the TV speakers, like you need those.  Also, this TV has the same specs as the Aquos version, except no goofy magnetic remote control.  Oh, yeah, use your Fios STB remote to run the TV, DVD and STB.  It works great.  Follow the insructions provided by Verizon on the remote control, make all the units turn off and on at the same time.", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great little TV", "Author": "Claudine Gandolfi \"Claudine Gandolfi\"", "ReviewID": "RGR6QZT9SDIR8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV 2 years ago, free, with Verizon FiOS. It's still working perfect. Picture is great but fyi I was getting rid of a 20\" CRT TV with this. The sound is good, clear, maybe a little tinny, but it's fine for what it is. There are 2 things I would have appreciated knowing. 1) The viewing angle can't be adjusted very much up and down. I have the TV up on a tallboy dresser and had to put a book under the rear to tilt the angle of the TV downward so I could view in bed. 3) The screen isn't very bright. I have it on the brightest setting and it's still very dark. During dark scenes I sometimes lose distinction on what's on screen.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Surprise,surprise!", "Author": "Susan M.

All I can say is WOW! Loaded with features, beautiful picture when used with FiOS, easy to use--well worth the wait.The set fits in great where I wanted it to.  It's not the biggest TV in the world (what do you expect for free?) but it's a great little set.", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "HD is FREE, with digital cable availibility.", "Author": "D.

It worked great, until there was a power outage in the area. She had the tv plugged into a power surge stripe, but when the power came back on within minutes of it going out, her tv would not turn back on. Someone told us that the tv may have a reset button on it, but we have even taken the back off, and still can't seem to find any button.  I refuse to throw it away until I have tried everything possible. Could it be the remote? ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS!!!!!!
