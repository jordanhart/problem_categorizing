{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best rear projection tv for the money!", "Author": "Roy Chan", "ReviewID": "R23O7CCGCNG8RW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Solid video processing with CineMotion 3:2 pull-down; 46-inch, 16:9, HDTV-capable rear-projector; 480p and 1080i display capability; 3D-YC comb filter; two-tuner picture-in-picture mode; relatively inexpensive.Cons: No independent input memory; tabletop design is an awkward, in-between height; nonremovable protective screen.Summary: I have had this tv for almost 6 weeks and so far, I have never regretted buying it! The only regret is not buying it sooner! In fact, so impressed am I with the picture and the sound that I have already recommended it to a friend who is in the mkt for a new tv. After some research of his own and his own personally conducted \"eye-ball\" test, he came the same conclusion and purchased the set 1 wk after my recommendation. I believe the HD microfocus lens and picture tubes really work to produce a superb picture -- such that it's hard to believe that it's rear-projection and not the standart CRT which are purported to be clearer, but that in this case it's not! Also, the $3000CAD that we paid included the tv stand which makes it a great value when compared to other rptvs of this size. I watch only cable tv on this set and I am still amazed at the picture. I also watch DVDs on progressive scan and am very happy with the PERFECT picture -- which goes to show what it's capable of, given a superior signal. Overall, this a great widescreen TV.", "Date": "April 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "Simply Beautiful!!", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R3737WP6TPXR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've had this TV for a few months now, and the picture still blows us away. There are only a handfull of High Definition channels right now, but watching an HDTV broadcast, makes this set worth every penny. Watching sporting events in HD is like having a seat inside the stadium / arena(This set is a football lover's dream. ESPN HD is the coolest!). We looked at a bunch of different models, including some of the bigger screens, but this one is just the perfect size for us, and the Sony was the most highly recommended by salespeople(they always noted how busy repair guys were with some of the other models). A good store will have HD pumped in on all their TVs to help with deciding which unit has the best picture. The Sony was sharp, the sound was good, and the remote was easy to learn. Also, watching DVDs with the progressive scan is like going to the movies. With the different audio and video setups, multiple inputs(including a convenient front input), and universal remote(included), you'll be very pleased with this set, whether you're watching the latest movie on DVD, catching the playoffs, or watching your favorite show in HD. This one is a good choice.", "Date": "September 8, 2003"}, {"Title": "best TV I ever had", "Author": "Robert J.

The picture and sound was impressive.  Moving it around was easy as it is not as heavy as it looks.  The manual was easy to read and connecting everything I had on it was simple.  As the years went by I began to notice that the left and right side stayed brighter than the center of the screen giving it the appearance of a layer of film over the screen which was not pleasant to the eyes.  I opened it which I do not recommend you do but I am electronically trained and the parts are very sensitive and can be dangerous to tamper with without little knowledge in electronics.  I dusted of the mirror and screen and gently wiped the 3 lens inside with a professional cleaning agent and the t.v. was back at it's original performance that I was able to enjoy for 8 yrs now until the convergence chips went out on it just yesterday :(  I love the t.v. so much and it has been with me for so long that I ordered the parts to repair it myself and hope to keep it another few years before I am able to save up enough money for a larger better t.v. in the future.  I will update on the outcome of the repair as soon as I get the parts.
