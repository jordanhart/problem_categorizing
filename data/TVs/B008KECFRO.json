We returned that one and went to a B&M; retailer to purchase the TV.

I noticed a lot of judder and motionblur in the tv, not so much during movies as gaming, though it is there through both.Talking to sony support they gave me a page (will be under the review) and it greatly helped though did not fully get rid of it.My old Vizio LCD 120hz from 2008 had no problems between tv, gaming, etc.  For this tv you will need to switch between settings when playing games or watching tv.TV was one nighted from amazon with no damage.  I couldn't tell you about the sound as I use a surround sound unit.  The TV is very thin though, so thin that if you swivel on a mount you can see the tv flex a bit.  The screen has little to no protection, as even if you barely touch it, it looks like you are pushing hard into it (the wave/colors).(I did find a game mode, but its under \"scene\" on the remote, not picture nor menu)Per sony website/supportThere is a lag or delay in the picture when playing a video game.SolutionThis can potentially occur on a High-Definition Television (HDTV) because of the built-in noise reduction and other picture adjustment circuitry designed to enhance the quality of high-resolution content. Although great when watching video from other sources, this circuitry can slow the reaction time from your controller and what you see on the TV screen when playing a video game.If your TV has a Game mode, you can resolve this issue by going into the TV menu and turning the Game mode to On . This will disable any noise-reduction and picture adjustment circuitry and allow the video game signal into the TV without slowing the response time.However, if your TV does not have a Game mode, you will need to check the Video or Picture menu of your TV and manually set any of the following options to Off :\u00a1Noise Reduction\u00a1Dynamic Range Control (DRC)\u00a1Motion Enhancer\u00a1CineMotion", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Purchase\"", "Author": "JGD", "ReviewID": "RBQODBUVL32E2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exceptional picture with deep color tones and vivid colors.Perfect weight and clean design.The setup is easy and making this Bravia a perfect purchase.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "LED", "Author": "Krunal", "ReviewID": "RDKIKXHDEUW10", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this TV.

A new TV was not really in the budget, it was important that the replacement represented a good value.  I looked at several options, but eventually settled on this Sony 42\" LED model.  At ~$500 it was roughly 1/2 the price the Philips was 4 years ago.  The Sony, while not as thin as some today, has a much thinner profile, bezel, and lighter weight than the TV it replaces.  Since we weren't wall mounting this wasn't super important for us, but it was much more pleasant lugging the box in and installing thanks to the lighter weight.  Installation and basic setup was easy, taking about 15 minutes.I was a little disappointed in the lack of input options available on this model.  The two HDMI, RGB Component, Co-ax, and VGA are all nice, but I would have liked to see the older composite video input option included as well (UPDATE turns out the green input from the component input can be used along with the red and white inputs for composite).  The menus and firmware are nothing special, but easy to use.  There's no fancy TV apps available here, but at this price I don't consider that a problem.Picture quality is acceptable.  I'm still fiddling with the color and contrast settings trying to find a good compromise between vivid colors and realisitic flesh tones.  Wierdly, with the Live Color setting set to High, colors are both too vivid AND too washed out at the same time.  Reds, blues, and greens are way too strong, while flesh tones and browns are muted.  I suspect some more time tweaking the menu options will find a happy medium.  Overall contrast performance seems much better than my old Philips, with less of the black brightening and dimming due to the active backlighting in that model.On the whole I'm very impressed for the price.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "howeroyt", "ReviewID": "R33TMSEZDASMWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great looking TV, easy set up, easy to operate, great picture, nice remote no mystery here, great addition to my cable set up - acquired at a great price from Amazon", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV, very intuitive..", "Author": "Jack McFarlane", "ReviewID": "R2P4Z2FYZ8ETDO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to say that I am a Sony guy when it comes to tvs. I couldn't believe a 42\"  led would be as cheap as this was!

I watch a bit of B-Screen horror and Sci-fi with lots of dark scenes. I tried many times to adjust the settings for dark scenes, and I disabled the auto-dim in the setup menu. Nothing worked. Frustrated, I gave the TV a one star rating because the dark scenes were virtually unwatchable, they were so dark.I googled the problem and finally found a solution. You have to go to the \"scene\" called \"Music\" then go to settings, video settings. Under advanced settings, you will find a checkbox for \"detect dark scenes and dim.\" Check no, then exit menu. Voila! No more auto dimming on dark scenes!Once I was able to turn that off, I stuck with the Music scene and did some tweaks to get the picture the way I like it. Now the picture quality is beautiful! My faith is restorerd in Sony quality. My best guess is that the \"detect dark scenes and dim\" box is an \"exception\" rule that ships in \"off\" mode but somehow it shipped with the auto-dim turned on by accident.I'm re-rating it from one star to four, I would have given it a five if not for all the effort I had to put into it to get it to display how I wanted it look in the first place.Now that I know how to fix this issue, I'm getting the 32 inch Bravia for our bedroom! :-)  So, yes I recommend buying this product.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value.", "Author": "Pai Gow", "ReviewID": "R2ZBEJOG2OOBDF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not really a high tech person as I purchased this to replace a 13 year old, 230 pound, standard def,32 inch Sony Wega.

I told myself that I wouldn't buy a 60hz, but in the end, the reviews were so good that I thought it would be better to buy a high quality 60hz than a low quality 120hz.

I've never really been an HD fan, I just wanted a bigger screen and this does the job.  The picture is pretty good though, but I'm going from a 32 standard def to this, so take that comment with a grain of salt.

McCasland", "ReviewID": "RAG6V4OANIKA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our old Sony tube HD set (12 years old) went out.  I did some basic research, went to BestBuy to look at TVs, and ended up buying a very highly rated Samsung (UN40EH6030).  It arrived with the Disney TV calibration disk (Wow: World of Wonder) and I dialed it in.  DVD images were stunningly good -- the best I've ever seen on any TV; however, output from my Tivo Premiere HD was frankly poor with HD content -- and SD content was practically unwatchable.  I changed output settings, recalibrated many times, and would fool myself into thinking it looked good.  Yet, when I left the room and came back or slept on it and saw it the next day, my immediate feeling what the picture looked poor.  When my wife said something out of the blue, I knew I wasn't dreaming.So I purchased this Sony in hopes of tapping into our decade+ of good luck and excellent picture quality we used to enjoy with our tube-HD TV.  Out of the box, this TV caused my heart to sink.  The picture was not at all good: way too saturated color, blown-out white levels, very dull picture, etc.  However, I spent about 20 minutes working with it (mainly turning down/off alot of the intelligent contrast and black level controls, decreasing brightness, decreasing sharpness, decreasing backlight, etc...).  When I was done, the SD/HD content from Tivo looked much better than I could ever get with days of playing/calibrating the Samsung -- as well as better than what our old tube-HD set could display.  And all of that was just me \"eyeing it\" -- I have yet to use the calibration DVD since the picture looks so good as is.DVD output looks good as well (but the Samsung looked better).  If we solely watched DVDs, I would have stuck with the Samsung.Also, I notice a little pixelation on fast graphics that was not present in the Samsung.  Yet, the overall picture quality on non-DVD sources is so much better that I can gladly live with the issues (and don't feel like spending double more to get a Sony XBR model to fix these minor drawbacks).In the end, we're sticking with the Sony and have returned the Samsung due to 95% of our viewing is Tivo in HD with some SD thrown-in; only occasionally do we watch a DVD.  We never watch (or like) 3D content.  Also, all the \"Smart TV\" stuff is on another flat-panel of ours -- and we never use it (Tivo provides Amazon/NetFlix streaming, photos, etc.).  So the lack of \"smartness\" is actually a plus in our eyes.

Not only is it energy-saving (if you're a green sustainability type like myself), but it's 42' inch, which is perfect size for any bedroom or living room - not too big, not too small. It also doesn't get any better than 1080p, unless you want 3D. Honestly, I couldn't give a crap less, since I'm still stuck in the Blu-Ray era (I'm a college girl, but with an old lady mentality.) I just wanted significantly better picture (720p vs 1080p), a bigger screen (from 32' to 42'), and better sound, which was a tad of an annoyance for me with my Insignia.

IF YOUR TV COMES FROM AMAZON AS AN EX44, DON'T BE ALARMED. IF YOU GO TO THE TV MENU AND HIT PRODUCT INFO, YOU'LL SEE IT'S A KDL42EX440 ALONG WITH THE SERIAL NUMBER AND TECHNICAL HOOHAH.

I was generally happy with the results. When I decided that I wanted better sound to enjoy Pandora and something to link Amazon Prime tv or the kids Apple tv, then I saw many of the error of my ways. Buying within a family of technology (Sony, Samsung, LG) give you first and foremost, connectivity. Second - image quality is better, at least I can say that about Sony as I own it.First, with low budget tv's - nothing connects. You have islands of technology.  I am not kidding - my kids mocked me in fun that it literally took 6 remotes to utilize one of our tv sets and all the equipment attached. Today I still have multiple items connected: This Sony TV, a Sony Bluray BD390 model (Amazon prime, better sound and IP noise reduction - make it a good choice), and a Sony AV system STR DH520 for exceptional sound plus of course my cable box/DVR.  THE KEY IS ALL WORK NOW WITH THE COMCAST REMOTE. One remote now and the remote of choice for my family as they all know the cable remote already. It's simple too - using Bravia sync, all the Sony items link together one time behind the scene and afterwards all work in unison even through the cable remote.Second, This Sony EX440 picture is exceptionally deep and real. I did not know this till I upgraded but a television like this has a better picture. Regardless if it is 60 or 120 hz, as I have both in my house, the Sony is indeed as crisp even with sports as any 120 hz tv but the photo quality is much better on the Sony - everything looks more real. I am comparing 2012 model tv's when I make that statement too - if your tv is older then you will notice an even bigger difference. With new tv's they look good even a foot away and a Sony looks so real.Getting back to technology simplicity, I bought a 2nd Sony EX440 and Sony BD390 from a local appliance store (at nearly the same price) so that my other Sony surround sound system worked as easy as the first. We have two main tv locations like many family's - downstairs (man cave) and great room.  Both have the same set up and same cable remote driving everything. They are not the biggest but a super real looking 42 inch is more satisfying than the larger one we replaced downstairs.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Capt.", "Author": "H2", "ReviewID": "RRN3S61U5YLHW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Sony TV previously and it lasted 8 yrs. this may not seem to be long until I tell you the last 2 yrs. the TV was on for 20 hours a day.

If I were to look for a negative I could only say that it lacks enough hookup options in the back but that's only if your trying to hookup old technology. If your components are up to date then you'll have more than enough. I'll have to wait a few years to rate the longevity. If you want a great TV that is easy to hookup this is the one.  P.S.

I decided to stick with the standard high def component cable connections instead of HDMI because I am running a simple setup and don't plan to use the Sony for connection to a PC or DVR. However, at least I now have the option to do so in the future. The volume has some eq settings but I am using a home theater system for general audio. The picture also auto-adjusts to lighting conditions. All in all, the Bravia is an excellent, attractive LED that is surprisingly light with a slim and sleek design. The enclosed stand attaches to the base with three screws.

I am pleased to see that this one exudes a bit more of the old-school Sony quality. The picture is stellar from any digital source and (unfortunately) it really shows up any shortcomings in DVDs and analogue signals (I am going to need a 1080-capable video card for my HTPC now, and an HDMI cable. Even the component (analog) connection from my DVD player is showing its limitations) When viewing from the sofa, blacks are satisfyingly deep, less so once you stand up or move away to the side. Also I'm pleased with the way subtle tones and gradations are handled. I was a bit concerned that for all the wow-factor in the store, an LED-LCD TV might have a slightly unnatural looking picture once I set it up at home. Not so. Not this one anyway. It's really very good. Minuses? Limited number of inputs. I can't connect a composite video signal without disconnecting my component video from the DVD, because there isn't a dedicated jack! Seriously, they must have saved all of 3 cents per unit there. And, although it has every tuner known to man (NTSC, ATSC, QAM), there's only one coaxial input. Wow, saved another 4c there! Granted I can't remember the last time I actually switched on the VCR, and I have decided to eschew cable for now since I get 7 digital channels over the air, but if I wanted to keep just one more non-HDMI source connected, there would be some cursing going on. It's a shock to the system after the old GW which had more inputs than you could ever need. However, I can make it work and when getting this quality of display at this price, you really can't complain.

We bought this to \"upgrade\" from a smaller bravia we had for years.  We loved it.  Due to my inexperience, I pretty much just went with a \"bigger is better\" mentality when we ordered this, and didn't really pay attention to many details.  (1) The color on this is very inferior to the older bravia, IMO (2) I would have liked to have more I/O jacks/ports on this model, specifically audio out.  We have started using apple TV, which goes into the TV through an HDMI jack, but the only audio out to the stereo is with a headphone jack (3) The thing that i REALLY hate about this TV is the power switch.  Many/All of the operating controls are in the form of a touch pad on the front of the TV...no \"buttons\".  So, picture this....it's bedtime, and you're done watching TV for the evening.  You turn off the lights to the room, and then go to tunr off the TV, but you can't find the \"button\" because it's not there.  Instead, it's a TINY TINY SENSOR, with a TINY TINY label.

Colors are bright and vivid, blacks are dark, and everything looks sharp.  The sound on this TV is also surprising for a flat screen TV.  Remote and menus are very simple to use also.  The TV is really thin and light for its size.There are a few major issues with this TV.  First, as noted by other reviewers, Sony's \"TrueMotion 120\" is deceiving.  It is NOT a 120Hz TV, it is actually 60Hz.  With that said, motion looks really good, but I can still detect a little motion blur.While the menus are simple to use, they don't offer you much in the way of picture adjustments.  You get some scene and picture modes but no dedicated \"contrast\" or \"brightness\" or anything like that (at least that I can find).  However, the picture looks great in any mode, so no big issue there.My final issue is that it only has 2 HDMI ports.  I can't really dock a star for this, since I knew this going into the purchase, but for a TV in a den or living room, you may need more ports that that.  We've used up both ports with our DISH receiver and Blu-Ray player already.Overall, if you aren't going to have a lot of HDMI devices, I would recommend this TV (despite its other shortcomings).", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Geat TV", "Author": "G.

For example, in Tucson using a roof antenna with the auto scan, the TV finds station KHRR-DT (Telemundo) is 40.1, Exitos 40.2, and S.O.I. is 40.3. Using the up-down channel selector on the remote, Telemundo and Exitos switch back and forth fine, but S.O.I. will not display. Instead, the TV comes up with an information box that says \"signal cannot be decoded\". But if I first type in any number far from 40, say 8 or 50, and then type into the controller 40.3, S.O.I. comes in just fine. This is the ONLY way to see this channel. If I now jump to another channel I can jump back, but if I use the up-down channel switch, we're back to \"signal cannot be decoded\".

As some of you may know, the pricing, and information on the website changes almost from hour to hour, so if you order during one of those \"off\" times,  too bad.
