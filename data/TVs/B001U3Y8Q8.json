At that time, the Samsung B650 had just come out, but its high gloss panel would not have performed well in my brightly lit room.  My high definition projection TV had kicked the bucket after 8-years, but I rarely enjoyed watching HD because the daylight glare would wash out the picture.  The Sony's non-glare screen performed well except when the picture would black out during dark movie scenes.  I discovered that many of the V5100 series have had this glitch and Sony had no fix for it at that time.  To Best Buy's credit, they cheerfully exchanged the Sony under their 30-day return policy and delivered the Samsung B630 model which has a non-glare screen and is similar to the popular B650.My expectations of the new Samsung were that it would perform much like the Sony.  I could not have been more wrong.  The B630 was like viewing another huge leap in a television experience, while the Sony seemed to be of past technology.  The depth and breadth of Samsung's visual color tones are astounding and mesmerizing.  A perfect example of that came from viewing scenes of the Caribbean Sea.  The Sony could not match the Samsung's Wide Color Enhancer 3 processor with its three dimensional qualities and vibrant tones of turquoise, sea green, cobalt blue, coral pink and white sand clearly seen under the sea.  It literally was like being there.The Samsung's dynamic contrast of 80,000-1 was visibly superior to the Sony's 50,000-1 and convinced me that Samsung's contrast rating was more than a marketing numbers game.  The viewing angle of the Sony was horrific when moving away from center by seeing flesh tones morph into green.  Samsung's viewing angle was far better by maintaining the proper color tones, but it did lose contrast and brightness.  Of course, a slight turn of its swivel base helped to alleviate Samsung's viewing angle issue.The downside to Samsung's advanced technology was that every movie appeared as video and lost its magical cinema quality.  Sony was superior in dealing with this issue.  To address that problem, the backlight and contrast settings have to be toned down to soften the picture and to preserve a film's attributes.  Most importantly, an adjustment to the 120 Hz Motion Plus feature must be done in order to keep movies from appearing surreal.  While some recommend turning the 120 Hz off, I found video blurring far too annoying and placed the Auto Motion Plus to a custom setting of 6 for blur and judder reduction.  That seemed like a good compromise without losing much of the film's realistic movement.  Experiment with every adjustment to find your best settings and calibration instructions are easily found on [...].  It all came together beautifully for me and hopefully this information can be helpful to you.One bad design feature was the power and channel functions on the TV itself.  You cannot see where they are unless you have light shining directly on them.  As long as you use only the remote control, it may be a non-issue.  By-the-way, in case you were wondering how effective the non-glare screen was on the Samsung B630; it was perfect.  I experienced crystal clear high definition TV -- Day or Night.", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "An excellent LCD HDTV at any price!", "Author": "S. Gibb \"shawnost\"", "ReviewID": "RQJP0VBO13G7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this item locally but am so impressed by the TV that I felt I should post my impression for others trying to decide where to spend their hard earned money, especially these days.First, I would recommend that you to your local electronics store and look around and see which sets grab your attention as what is best to my eyes may not work for you.  In my case I was somewhat limited in selection since the TV must fit into a TV cabinet that we own, so 40\" was my absolute max.  This criteria limited me to Sony, Samsung, and Vizio (in order of price point).  A local warehouse club had the Vizio and a comparable Samsung (ln40b610 vs. ln40b630) for side by side comparison, and simply put there was no comparison what-so-ever.  The Samsung wins hands down in terms of picture clarity, overall brightness, and contrast.  The 80,000:1 contrast on this TV really shines.  The Samsung to Sony comparison was a bit tighter as both units offered incredible picture quality and features but again the contrast ratio on the Samsung just made everything appear more pleasing to my eye.  Given this, we purchased the Samsung and haven't looked back.  Every time my wife and I watch a Blu-ray movie we are even more impressed with the picture quality!  Seriously, this is a great TV at any price.  The only TV I looked at that had better contrast was the Samsung LED (3,000,000:1) model but the price difference was just too much to justify.I do have to agree with other reviewers regarding the \"Auto Motion\" settings producing images that are almost surreal.  I have found that setting this on the middle setting produces the best results for me, but I have not played much with the custom adjustment mode yet, so I will hold off on a final review until I have had more time to tweak.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture with tons of options for tweaking", "Author": "eddiebones", "ReviewID": "R1ZHVYGAPX53YA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old RCA 27\" tube finally died, so it was time to enter into the world of HDTV's. After a ton of research and price hunting, I settled in on this 40\" model for the full 1080, 120hZ experience (plus a smokin' deal from Amazon helped seal the deal).First one arrived shattered, so that was a bit of a buzz kill. Fortunately the delivery includes set up & power up, so we immediately saw that the thing was destroyed. The delivery crew took it back with them and Amazon got another one out. The 2nd one arrived in perfect condition, and after getting DirecTV out to install the HD dish, I've been on HD for about a week now. I know this is not part of the product review, but Amazon's customer service was excellent in this matter.All I can say is that the picture is more than I anticipated, having never owned an HDTV before. The clarity is unreal, the colors and images just pop off the screen.Sports and movies are incredible to watch. I do see how some folks are a bit taken aback by how crisp movies appear (as if in 3d), and they have to get used to the look of cinema based stuff. It doesn't really bother me that much, as I know that's the byproduct of HD. It's crisp. It's clear. But I set the 120Hz option to standard, and I find that works well enough for my eyes. There are certain scenes in some movies that just look surreal, but not in a bad way (at least to me).The amount of control that this TV gives you to adjust the picture is great -- you can stick with one of their built in \"modes\" (dynamic, standard, natural or movie) and then customize every aspect of the picture as much as you wish. I spent a couple of days just playing with the settings & calibrating. The dynamic mode is way too bright, and gives results that are just not natural. I've found that the \"natural\" mode works best for me, with additional adjustments in contrast & brightness to enhance the blacks as much as possible. The \"standard\" mode allows you to push the blacks even more deep, so I've been going back & forth between both that & \"natural\". If desired, you can adjust for gamma, white balance, flesh tones, so you can go pretty deep.I do have to say that at this point, the 120Hz feature doesn't really appear to add that much. I did read in a number of reviews that it is not easy to discern the difference between 60 and 120Hz in most viewing situations. A fast millisecond response rate is where you want to be, and with this TV's 4ms response time, there's no issues. And for me, I don't mind having a little blur on fast moving scenes.I have watched movies & sports on my dad's samsung 37\" HDTV (LN37A450), which is a 60Hz model, and have to say that the picture looks just as incredible as on this 40\". So if you're looking to save a couple hundred bucks, don't get too hung up on the 60Hz/120Hz issue. Go with the 60Hz, and you'll be plenty satisfied. But if you can get a deal for a 120Hz Samsung for under $1k, it's worth it. Always nice to have extra options, as long as you're not breaking the bank to do it. I just have not seen a major difference between the two. Having said that, I've not watched any blu-ray movies yet, but have watched a couple of HD movies from DirecTV. But most of the complaints about the 120Hz are with people who think it makes movies look weird -- so again, 60Hz won't kill you there. If you're a gamer, you may want to do some more research on it. I don't own an Xbox, Playstation or Wii, so I can't speak to that.Many complain about the sound on this TV as well, but I found that with the surround turned on, the TV gives off a pretty decent output. I hooked up the stereo to the tv, so usually have the audio coming through the full stereo. But on it's own, the TV isn't too bad, especially for such a slim profile.The touch of color is a really nice feature as well -- it does give the TV a very sophisticated look. I was concerned that the red may be distracting, but it's tastefully done and very subtle.Overall, I don't regret purchasing this TV - I could've saved some $$$ by going with the B550 model and sticking with 60Hz, but for the price that Amazon had at the time($999), I felt that I'd just get the extra options.For what it's worth, I believe that this TV is also an 'A' panel. I'm not even sure if there are 'S' panels being made anymore. If the last letter of the serial number is how this is determined, then I don't see 'S' panels on any of their models. But whatever type panel it has, it doesn't matter. It looks fantastic, and even more so after being adjusted/calibrated best to display in my living room. There is a review out there (hi Matt!!) that gave the tv one star because of this panel issue...but said little to nothing else on how the tv actually was performing. One of the complaints about 'A' panels was that the 'off angle' viewing was very poor. First of all, I don't know why you'd want to view these TV's from too severe of an \"off angle\" -- you want to be in front of it as much as possible -- maybe 45 degrees off...but I've also inspected it from severe angles (pushing 160-170 degrees) and the picture holds up just fine.This model is fantastic. I still can't believe my eyes when watching some stuff...there was a show about the Grand Canyon on National Geographic channel this weekend. All I can say is, wow. Unbelievable. The epic Wimbledon final between Federer and Roddick was also fun to watch.No regrets here at all. Great TV. Brilliant picture, with plenty of options to tweak to your preference.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "I shouldn't have to pay more for a replacement!!!", "Author": "Sue", "ReviewID": "R2LZKPPHIF9LLL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Delivery was great.

The plasma was a Panasonic TC-P42S1, the LCD was a Samsung LN40B630. I did my comparison channel-by-channel with lots of different programming, ranging from talk shows to cartoons to action movies to football games, in both high def and standard def.Both are very good 40-42 inch TVs, in my opinion. Once I had adjusted the settings to my liking, I was hard-pressed to say that one looked notably better or worse than the other, though each had its strengths and weaknesses.The Panasonic plasma had slightly more vibrant colors than the Samsung LCD. Blacks were noticably blacker and dark blues and purples looked deeper. The off-angle viewing was fantastic on the plasma, too. With the LCD, a smidge of color was lost when you shifted from 0 to 45 degrees. From deeper side angles, the picture was still watchable, but definitely shifted towards gray.However, the Samsung LCD had a brighter, crisper image. In a dark room, details stood out better, and any programming that wasn't dark looked a little sharper. During the day, with the sun shining in, the LCD's image held up a bit better, too.Motion is supposedly better on plasmas, but I couldn't really tell when comparing to a 120Hz LCD. Both TVs did equally well with typical television, and what blurs I saw seemed to be in the source material. I watched a football game for a while, but if the plasma gave a better viewing experience, it wasn't terribly obvious to me. Then again, I'm not a big sports fan, so maybe my eye isn't discerning enough. (Update: see below)Color accuracy seemed great on both TVs, but the Panasonic needed some adjusting to get there. The picture is too green with the default settings.Both TVs did a near-equal job with standard def programming (aside from the differences above).Sound: adequate on both. I have a surround-sound system, so I didn't really care.Hardware failures: I've read complaints about both brands -- seems like it's a roll of the dice either way. I went with a 4 year warranty.Other stuff: the Samsung had a better remote, a nicer menu system, and more fine adjustments available. I also like the swivel stand and the fact it's a lot lighter than the Panasonic. I didn't try the internet features on either TV.Overall, both are very good TVs, and all but the most picky videophiles would be happy with either. In 2009, both plasma and LCD have come a long way and which technology is \"better\" really boils down to your wallet, viewing conditions, and personal preference. It was a tough choice for me, but, in the end, the bright, crisp picture of the Samsung won out. I can live with marginally less vibrant colors, weaker blacks, and imperfect off-angle viewing (if I watch from the other room, I'll swivel the screen).*** UPDATE ***Turns out the Samsung has a demo mode that lets you split the screen and see one half with de-blur processing turned on and one half with it off. I did a little testing by hooking up my laptop and scrolling images and text around. Without the processing, there is a noticeable blur on high-contrast moving objects, though it wasn't significant enough to really bother me. _WITH_ the processing, moving text was more crisp, but there seemed to be a slight delay, which I imagine would make this mode unusable for serious videogamers. People who are highly sensitive to motion blurring might prefer a plasma.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "For this video novice, it's impressive", "Author": "dsrussell \"greyhater\"", "ReviewID": "R2UZNMU9FTOFQJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I admit that I'm not a videophile and for years I got along well with a conventional TV, so I'm not sure if my review will be of much use to readers.  And anyone that is getting their first HDTV will usually love it, no matter who the manufacturer is, so it's probably better to read reviews from those that have (or had) several HDTVs (especially from different manufacturers).That being said, here is my opinion.  It's a nice looking HDTV (but isn't really any nicer looking than many others).  It plays high quality hi-def expertly, but as this video novice has found out, not all hi-def is the same (nor is std-def).  The first blu-ray movie I played was 2001.  It brought out tremendous detail and rich texture, so I was extremely impressed (yes, it had a \"wow\" effect).  Hi-def sporting events (such as a baseball game) also looked very rich and detailed.  Simply put, if the source material is high quality, this set seems to have the capability of bringing this out in full ... which is what it is all about.And if the source isn't high quality?  That's another story.  Playing standard dvds on a regular dvd player doesn't make me sit up and take notice, but that's why I opted for the Oppo blu-ray / dvd up-converting player.  Up-converting does indeed make a difference (but that's another story and another review).  Also, std-def can be okay (at best) or very poor, but I didn't really buy this set for its std-def capability.  Then again, the hi-def coming from DirecTV can be hit and miss because of limitations of that media source.  Some programs are impressive, while others, not so much.  Plus DirecTV's HD content can be jumpy with some mysterious audio burps, which is very distracting.  This is NOT the fault of this, or any other, TV (it's a source problem), but I thought I'd mention it for all the DirecTV users out there.The default settings are surprisingly good (I made only a few very minor adjustments to the sharpness, brightness and contrast using the \"Spears & Munsil\" benchmark blu-ray disk that was supplied with the Oppo player).  The menus seemed well designed and I haven't had a problem going through them (just a problem of understanding what some of these settings really mean).Since this set is in a very bright room (lots of windows), I needed a screen with a matt finish.  It does a good job, but one will still see reflections (it does diffuse them well, thankfully).  The viewing angle is decent, but not great.  There is definitely a fairly narrow \"sweet spot\" (within about 30 degrees or so), but that's okay by me (I can figure out where I should sit).  BTW, your mileage may vary (my girlfriend bought the identical set and her viewing angle is superior to mine ... could be different panel manufacturers).As far as what I do not like, there are several items that I'll mention, but all are rather minor complaints:1.  The default AMP (auto motion plus) setting of \"standard\" (120 Hz), gives most programs the soap opera effect.  Talk about weird!  Fortunately, there are menu settings to adjust this, especially the ability to customize the setting via a slide bar menu option.  The various AMP settings (clear = min; standard = medium; smooth = max), don't tell me much.  Do any of these settings lower the 120 Hz rate?  It was aggravating that Samsung doesn't explain this is.2.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the front panel touch controls on the TV are difficult to see, and impossible in a dimly-lit room, which makes them useless.  Then again, I haven't often used these controls in the past on my TVs, so this isn't really that big of a deal to me.  I just found this to be a bad design choice.3.  Since I'm more of an audiophile, I found the sound coming from this set to be pretty bad ... to put it mildly (yes, I adjusted the equalizer and turned on SRS, which helped, but audio is an afterthought on TVs and always has been).  I use a separate sound system (as I did with my older CRT TV) and recommend that most people should do the same.4.  Because this HDTV does so much, there is a huge amount of information to process and the manual is a bit difficult to read.  The diagrams are too small (as well as the print) and many are too dark.  This set has a slew of options and not all are given their just due.  Explanations are often brief and some confusing (does the HDMI/DMI port work with a standard HDMI cable, or must one use that port only with a DMI to HDMI adapter?).  Basically, I found the manual just okay (after rereading it a few times, but YMMV).Since it is impossible to make a judgement of picture quality in stores (I don't have the foggiest idea of how they have been set up), picking the Samsung was a crapshoot.  And unless I tested several brands in my home, I have no way of knowing which is the best ... for me.  Would I be just as happy with another brand?  Probably.  Still, I give this Samsung a solid 8 out of 10 (or a 4-star rating).  It seems to be a reasonably priced set and can reproduce a quality source in fine, and at times, extremely impressive detail, but don't ask me which manufacturer has the best HDTV, because I simply don't have a clue.", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "One of the best in terms of getting your bang for your buck", "Author": "M. Ryan Smith \"Ryan Smith\"", "ReviewID": "R2SILQI8NFWYE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, this is my first HDTV, so obviously I'm blown away by the visuals. Even playing regular old DVD's look 10x better than they did on my old CRT TV. I won't bore you with the same raving reviews that others have already given this fantastic TV (though they are all correct - this TV is AMAZING). Instead, I have a few things I'd like to point out that maybe contradict what others have said or offer a different point of view:The sound. Coming from a standard def TV and having never used external speakers, I have absolutely no problem with the sound output of this TV. At max volume it's way louder than you'd ever want it to be, and I find the clarity to be on par with what I'm used to. In the world of music I consider myself an audiophile (all mp3's at 320kbps or greater, as I can easily hear the differences in it vs 128kbps - just so you know my ears are still good). However, in the world of TVs I guess I'm not. I found it to be loud and crystal clear, so if you're like me and never used an external speaker setup then this set should be fine.The Red Touch of Color. I didn't notice too many reviewers of this model complaining about it, but on others in the Samsung series some people HATED it. I even read one or two of people RETURNING THEIR TV because of it. Just wanted to say that's assinine. When the TV is on you can't even see it unless you are actively looking for it. When the TV is off it's subtle enough that it's either not noticed or perceived as a nice touch to the set.The matte screen. The matte screen is great at removing glare from ambient lighting. My fiance and I usually have a lamp turned on while watching TV and I've never noticed a glare at all from it. Sunlight through the windows can be seen sometimes, but I suppose that is all based off of where you are sitting, the position of the window to the TV, etc.  It does a good job with ambient lighting, but don't think it'll magically remove all glares all the time.The buttons on the display. Yep, everybody's right. They're difficult to find. Don't lose your remote because Samsung really dropped the ball on this one. Oh well, life goes on, and all in all it's not that big of a deal.Infolink. Pretty useless at the moment. Gives a broad weather forecast and some news highlights, but nothing special. What I'm excited about is what they do with it in the future. Having an ethernet port on a TV opens up so many posibilities. I can't wait to see what they bring to the table in future models (maybe some Amazon VoD? Netflix streaming? Or how about an internal HDD that automatically fetches the latest edition of podcasts you watch on a weekly basis? Or even a web browser!) I already do these things via my Xbox 360 or using an external HDD connected to the USB port, but it would be nice if this was all integrated into the TV in a future model. I'm very excited to see where the industry goes with this.Overall, this TV is just plain awesome. And if you're lucky enough to get it under $1000 like I did, then you're getting one heck of a deal. I've been looking for a TV that meets my high standards for about the last 8 or 9 months, and I stumbled upon this one at a price hundreds below what I was willing to spend. Fantastic deal, fantastic TV. You're gonna love it.And now for my review of CEVA (which in no way will reflect the score I give this PRODUCT. This is a place to rate PRODUCTS, not the service you get from Amazon or other sellers!!).CEVA was quite simply the most unprofessional service I've ever been given. He did arrive at my place on time, at which point he said he needed my help getting the TV from his van to my living room. Bring a dolly? A cart? So I give him a hand with that, and when he starts unboxing it and tells me \"Okay, now you grab that end and we'll lift it straight up....\"  Oh, ok, so I guess now I'll be setting it up with him, even though it's his job that he's paid to do.We get it unwrapped and he needs to install the the stand that came with it. The instructions he was reading for it (4 simple pictures in total) indicated he needed to use 8 screws, but the TV came with 12! Oh no! Not 12! What does this mean?!  He was completely dumbfounded about why they would send 12 screws if the instructions only called for 8. I had to convince him that it was ok and we could install the stand the way the instructions said. He stayed confused for about the next 5 minutes and finally gave in. He looks at me and says \"Ok, well where's your screwdriver? Gonna need a philips head.\"  Are you kidding me? This is your job and you don't bring your own tools?! I don't mind letting people use my tools or anything, but I just can't believe this guy does this on a daily basis and doesn't bring his own equipment. Ridiculous.Eventually we got the TV set up. Before I had a chance to plug the power cable in he was handing me a piece of paper to sign for delivery. At this point I was getting a bit frustrated, so I politely but firmly told him to wait while I make sure the TV turns on, gets a signal, and there are no signs of defects upon delivery. He obviously didn't like waiting, so I took my time :)  Maybe that was my mistake because I then signed for delivery, at which point he assumes job complete. I looked over at the box and packing material and he tells me \"Now I am supposed to take the box and everything away if you wish, but I strongly recommend not doing so because if that TV goes bad in a week or so they're gonna want the box it came in for returns.\" Not wanting to put up with him anymore, I told him to have a nice day. He didn't bother picking up the packing material or anything either. Pretty much left my living room a complete disaster.Like I said earlier, my experience with CEVA was about as unprofessional as it gets.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC.", "Author": "M. Leftwich \"TheShaman\"", "ReviewID": "R2OABFGD3PX1R3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a TV to replace an old 27\" CRT in the bedroom, and after lots of shopping and comparing and reading my wife and I chose this one - we got a heck of a package deal on the TV, an 8' HDMI cable, and a Sylvania Blu-Ray player all for $999 (thank you AMAZON!!! - what a great purchasing experience from start to finish - including CEVA shipping/delivery!). The TV just arrived today (10 days from first placing the order), we got it set up within minutes, and the picture right out of the box looks fantastic - truly stunning. The 120Hz makes a noticeable difference in reducing motion-blur, and improves the overall clarity and crispness of the picture in my opinion. I love the fact that there are so many ways to adjust/tweak different settings to your own tastes - so if you don't like the de-judder effects but want the blur reduction, you can adjust them independent of one another - something the A series from last year doesn't allow.Sound was a little thin initially, but some adjustments using the EQ and turning surround sound \"on\" made it sound much better. I plan on calibrating the picture later this week and can't wait to watch Blu-Ray movies on it, but believe me when I say that the picture will not disappoint.Chose the Samsung b630 over the b650 series because a) it was significantly cheaper at the time we ordered, b) doesn't have the extra \"widgets\" that are useless to us, and c) has a semi-matte screen instead of the \"ultra clear\" screen of the 650s, which works great for us as we have some windows/lights to contend with. Chose the Samsung brand over other brands because of the price/performance ratio and all the positive reviews that these TV's consistently get. Finally, we chose LCD over other technologies because at this size (40\"), LCD gives the best price/performance and doesn't use as much power as some of the other TVs (e.g., plasma).This TV (as well as the bigger sizes) would be perfect as a primary TV - being able to use it as a secondary TV in the bedroom makes it seem like I really splurged - but it was a great bargain in my opinion and definitely MONEY WELL SPENT.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "incredibly good", "Author": "D.

Just great with factory settings, but I like a more subtle color. I am sure that the numbers on the contrast levels are valid only in comparison with other Samsung models, but however you scale it, this thing has an incredible contrast ratio. If you use the Menu and reduce the contrast and backlighting bit, then play with the color intensity, you will have a picture equal to sitting aross the room from the person on screen.By the way, I found that HGTV (Home & Garden) and Macy's commercials have the most consistently perfect images for judging color and contrast. What was unexpected was the nearly 3D effect of the picture.To protect my investment I bought a constant voltage transformer (voltage regulator) that also functions as a surge protector. This also lessens the likelihood of power surge damage (nothing will save you from a direct lightning strike) but it also maintains a constant voltage level so there are no fluctuations in picture color.All this and I do not have HD, just standard Direct TV cable.

I chose Scheduled and it was a snap. I picked my delivery date & time - it was 7 days later which I would expect. They called me that day to ask me if they could deliver the TV an hour early.  The delivery person was aces.  He set the TV up, put the batteries in the remote and even set up the channel scan and waited to see the picture come up and that all was working well.  (And he even moved my old TV upstairs.)  The only thing he could have done better was if he made the popcorn and got me a cold drink.  I tipped him and rated him A+ - very nice man, also.  Now - the TV -  the picture is great.  I do love the non-glare screen as I have a lot of windows. The shiny frame practically disappears when you are watching it.  To my relief the red hardly shows at all. The sound is good- the \"Clear Voice\" feature is excellent for my slight hearing loss. I have a sound system, but use the TV's sound. I am still learning about the advanced net features. A nice little thing is that on most TV's the idiot light (power on or off lt.) is on when you are watching it.  I always taped this up as it was distracting. With this set the little red light is off when the set is on and shows when the set is off.  I don't find the obscurity of the controls a problem, cause who doesn't use a remote?! There is a pleasant chiming sound for power on and off. A nice user friendly perk on the menu is that when you highlight an item it tells you at the bottom of the screen what that function does.A problem solved for me:  when Time Warner Cable updated their software my old TV (Panasonic and a nice TV) would not keep the screen aspect consistently.  Every time I changed channels I would have to reset the aspect to fill the screen. But this Samsung LN40B630 is such an improvement - if you choose to set the screen size (eg. full screen) it maintains it even if you turn off the set and turn it back on. (That is the way it should be!) Now every channel fills up the screen. A nice bonus is the optional backlight in the remote. Even non-hd channels are much better than my other HD TV.  The pic is clear and bright. I use the Natural setting and tweaked it. For the lady with artifact problems - I had that too until I turned down the sharpness. Watching Nemo on the Dynamic setting was awesome...such beautiful colors. This set is hard to find sometimes.  I had a nightmare with BestBuy...they told me they had when they didn't and kept my money until it cleared days later.

Certainly enough time to discern if this is a good product or not.I chose the Samsung family because of the name and because I went to \"Best Buy\" and watched all of the t.v's right next to each other. It was the best picture.The B650 model was really the t.v. I wanted but I chose the LN40B630 model because it had a \"matte screen\" and I have issues with glare in my t.v. room.  I haven't regretted that decision.  There is still the slightest bit of glare but I am glad I didn't go with the \"clear screen\" .  I do kind of wish I had the internet t.v. capability of the B650 model but I do have a PS3 and that took care of that need because my PS3 is using my WIFI connection.The second reason I chose this model instead of the cheaper B530 and B550 models is because of the 120hz automotion feature.  I am very glad to have that feature.  It makes the hd movies fuller and helps with fast action movies and sports.The next reason I chose this t.v. instead of the cheaper models is that it had 4 hdmi and 2 usb ports.  I wanted to hook up my PS3, Wii, dvd recorder and VHS player directly to my t.v. and it works for me just fine.I love the rich colors, the size (40\" is just right for my 14-14 t.v room), the audio is sufficient.  I would like to setup surround sound at some point.The only complaint I have was the delivery.  The price was $999 from Amazon.  A real deal at that time and free shipping was included.  It took about 9-10 days to receive it, which wasn't that bad.  However, when the man brought it inside we both noticed that the set was damaged. Amazon responded pretty quickly and I received my next set in about 6-7 days.  So, I had to wait almost 3 weeks from the time I ordered it.  Not great but it was worth the wait.  These t.v's are delicate compared to the old tube types.I give this t.v. a 5 star.  By this time next year this t.v. will be \"old hat\" but that's the way technology goes.  You have to jump in at some point.Consider this medium level set if you are cost conscious.  It's worth the money and it beats a VIZIO every day of the week.", "Date": "September 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "LN40B630", "Author": "Arthur Vandalet", "ReviewID": "R2ODOJEH1XGRLA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will echo what the first reviewer, Rich Vergo said. Like he did, I initially purchased the Sony KDL-40V5100 (Sony's 2009 competition to the LNB630) and was fairly content. I originally thought about buying the Samsung LN40B650 but its higher price tag pushed me towards the Sony. I was pretty happy until I kept seeing the Samsung panel at a couple friends' houses. It didn't take too long to realized the difference between the two is so staggering I knew that I would not be able to live with the Sony set. Fortunately, I found the so similar B630 for the same price I paid for the V5100.I spent about three weeks experimenting and reading message boards to get a good configuration on the Sony. However, right out of the box the B630 image is breathtaking, to say the least. It's so crisp, the image appears three dimensional and the colors are so vivid.  Like Rich said, in comparison to the B630, the Sony LCD's look like old technology. Everything I've watched so far looks way better; Heck, even the Direct TV guide looks better on the Samsung.If you are in the market for a TV in this size and price range, I would highly recommend it. Even if you're considering saving $100 or so on a cheaper TV, I think the difference in quality is easily worth the difference in price. You might also want to look at the slightly more expensive B650 series. It's clear panel will provide a little better picture but will reflect more glare. I went for the B630 because it was $200 cheaper than the 650. The difference wasn't quite worth it.I've only found two negatives so far. First, the buttons on the panel are not buttons at all but rather some sort of touch sensitive mechanism and it's almost impossible to see them unless you have a spotlight and get up close. This renders them virtually useless. Second, the mounting holes are too close together and located too much towards the center of the TV. My current mount isn't the greatest and the way the holes are setup makes the TV unstable. I will probably need to buy a new mount.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Does it all and then some!", "Author": "P.

Actually it was this little old couple so I helped put it up on my table and they were very patient making sure that all parts worked, the stand was put together, and that we had a signal with no dead pixels so big thumbs up for CEVA from me at least.The TV does everything it claims. I agree with many of the other reviewers that Samsung could have done SOMETHING other than hiding the buttons behind the glass. Not a dealbreaker by any means but I have had to develop the ninja touch without looking or else find the remote. The various settings allowed me to get it just right in no time at all. Having moved up from a tube tv this is an AWESOME set for sports and movies. Football season just got a whole lot better. I can't tell if the 120hz makes a big difference or if it's just going from regular to HD on Sundays.Highly recommend for other buyers.

I waited until Black Friday to buy this TV, and certainly did not disappoint for only $800. I am a former employee for a large electronics retailer, and I can tell you that it is well known that Samsung is top-dog when it comes to LCD televisions. At this point I have owned the television for just over 9 weeks.This TV really fits all of the needs of anyone looking for a high quality TV that will do everything you could want a TV to do. The 120 Hz screen refresh rate is more than enough when it comes to LCD technology. The human eye cannot perceive a difference beyond this point, so if you are looking for a quality TV that you are not overpaying for, 120 Hz is the way to go. I've watched numerous sporting events on this TV over the past few months, and I have not been disappointed in the slightest about its performance.The 80,000:1 contrast ratio creates a vibrant and colorful environment on the screen. I watched Planet Earth in HD recently, and absolutely loved the level of detail this TV was able to bring to the screen. Its not a top-end HDTV, nor is it an LED TV, but it certainly does the job for me. I take the performance of my TV seriously, as I know what to look for having worked around them, and this TV has not disappointed me.The speakers are not the best on this TV, but flat screen televisions were designed to be compact, and speakers were the obvious choice to lower the quality/ability in order to achieve that goal. With that said, I would always recommend purchasing a surround sound system with the purchase of a flat screen TV. Having a great screen is only half of the battle. If the sound does not match up with the television, you won't find yourself in the story taking place on the screen. (This is why theaters have good sound systems & big screens.) Get yourself a quality sound system with an HDTV and you will find yourself immersed in the story.This product has plenty of inputs and outputs. Currently I have an Xbox (component HD), N64 (coax port), Srround Sound (audio out), Cable (HDMI), and computer input (HDMI). If you have a lap top with either TV shows, movies, or a DVD player, you can plug that computer into this TV and use the TV as a monitor or to view your media. I regularly watch TV shows from the internet player on my TV through my computer. The HMDI cable carries video and audio, so the entire system works with just one plug.All in all, I have found this to be a high-quality product. The TV also hooks up to the internet, though because this is a new technology, I expect that software updates will be in the future to upgrade this unit to stream Netflix movies and other online services. Its an inevitable next step in TV development. If you're looking for a cheaper, very high quality TV, look no further.

My son has an Xbox 360 and PS3 hooked up to this TV and they both look fantastic when playing on it and watching Blue-Ray DVDs.2) The infolink feature is not necessary, but a really convenient feature to have.  It displays the daily/weekly weather forecast in the corner of the screen for wherever you are with the touch of a button.  It also has stocks and news feeds if you like from USA Today.3) 4 HDMI Cables is a big deal.  Really, you don't realize how much it matters until you're hooking up Speakers, Xbox, PS3, Cable Box, etc etc.  I also bought a set of wireless headphones for this TV and it's nice that there's seperate audio output jacks just for this purpose.4) 2 USB ports!  This is extremly cool in my opinion.  The TV plays pictures, audio files, video files (was quite impressed by the variety of formats it plays -- mpg, mpeg, avi, and a few others), all from your USB Thumb drive or external hard drive!5) Sound is very good for built-in speakers.

Even if the panels in the sets are identical as my salesman claimed they were (so why not buy the cheaper one!), Samsung's image processor seems to have a lot more refinement than other less expensive brands, and I think that it really justifies the slightly additional cost of this TV.  There is more color and detail subtlety viewable in the image on this Samsung than in its competing TV's, and the color is better and more naturally represented, even in the (tacky and over-bright) Dynamic mode.The same retailer had a LN40C650, which has more features than the 630 model TV.  I have a PC hooked to this TV as well and so fancy internet features hold no interest for me, but moreover the 650 models have a glossier screen which I actually do NOT prefer over the semi-matte finish of the 630.  If I am trying to watch the TV in any type of light, the glossy screen increases reflections significantly, and I would rather take a minimal hit on the real-world-unattainable contrast ratio instead of hating my TV every sunny Saturday afternoon.If you are not going to calibrate the TV, I'd recommend setting it in Natural mode.  It was too dim viewing in the store, but most retailers have lights that are exactly one hojillion times brighter than in your home.  If you view especially in the evening or in dim rooms, the brightness level is set very good by default in this mode, and I (subjectively) feel that the color balance is the most realistic.  Rendered content doesn't 'pop' as much without the oversaturation, but isn't bleeding color problems the reason I got rid of my old CRT in the first place?With regard to Digital Noise Reduction, the 120Hz processing, and other features:  I do not see a huge difference, personally.  None of the content that I have viewed so far on my TV has shown me much different sitting 11 feet away.  My suggestion is to play with every setting, and find the viewing preferences that suit you.  Each persons preferred content will play a role in what settings are best, so I will not suggest any.  Just know that you can always say \"Reset Picture\" and start over if you muck them up too badly!Thanks for reading.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Purchase", "Author": "Daniel C.

Getting an hd one, in this day and age, is a given. After many hours of research, I went with this one, the Samsung LN40B630. My needs were pretty specific. I needed a tv that was at least 37\" to 46\", had multiple hdmi inputs, and was a bit under a grand. I was also planning on using this for my computer monitor. This Samsung, does all that and more. HD from Comcast looks great most of the time, but the non-hd stuff is only so-so. I had originally hooked it up with component for the cable and d-sub for the pc because I had ordered the hdmi cables the same time as the tv (I didn't expect the tv to get here in 4 days but nearly 2 weeks for the cables). Those both looked great. Once the hdi cables arrived, I hooked the stuff up proper. The cable tv looked about the same, but I had problems with the computer, lots of overscan. After going back to the d-sub, for about a week, I finally had time to mess around with the graphics card (a pny gtx 260, that was only about 1.5 weeks old) and tried every tweak imaginable. The problem was solved by uninstalling the drivers, but before reinstalling, hooking up the hdmi cables). It is now working great, with no overscan. I have yet to hook-up a blu-ray device, but have tried some 1080 content from elsewhere ;). It looks awesome. I like that I only need the optical cable from the tv to the receiver, as the rest is passed to the tv via hdmi. This tv also plays back [nearly] any format from the usb ports, and I mean tons (everything from divx/xvid through mpeg4 & h264 [mkvs!], though it doesn't list dts tracks as an option). I have only used a flash drive, but plan on an external hd in the future. I noticed that its internal decoder is better than playing stuff back on the computer, as least where scene-released tv shows are concerned. This fine set also includes a picture-in-picture feature, but the downside is that just takes whatever is going through the coax for the sub-pic. The sub-pic is resizeable and the position can be moved to any of the 4 corners. All and all, this tv is great for the person wanting to use it for both a tv and a computer monitor. I play WoW and Battlefield Bad Company 2, and they both look as good as can be. Lastly, the 120hz this is kind of a marketing gimmick. It can basically take your source material, none of which is available at 120hz to begin with, and it can place frames in for a smoother picture. I generally switch my setting between standard and smooth.

I did have to play around with the settings a bit to get the right colors, especially facial pigments. Also, the 120hz feature had to be dialed down a notch to avoid making filmed tv shows like sitcoms less jittery. Most shows I learned are at 60hz and so will appear jittery on here. Exception is live tv as far as I've noticed.  Basketball games for example were perfect.  I did see that turning the 120hz setting to its highest made the people on the tv seem almost 3-d.  But that jittery stuff was just too distracting.Sound is good for a tv speaker.  There's some pseudo surround sound you can turn on but in the end this not a home theater and we don't need that for the kids to watch.

This tv has the power button on the front bottom part of the tv, but it is not a button you push in; it is a button that is I think heat sensitive because you have to press power sign on the glass which is hard to see unless your looking straight at it. Think of the tv as a rectangle and on the bottom part of the rectangle smack dab in the middle is on button sensor. This is not in the manual which makes it even worse when trying to figure it out.

I didn't purchase on Amazon, so I can't speak to the shipping, but the quality of this TV is of the highest caliber. Initial setup took less than 30 minutes to fully assemble the stand, secure the screen, and start watching Blu Ray movies. The unit seamlessly links with my Samsung BDP1600 Blu Ray player through Samsungs BD Wise and the two way communication between player and television is a nice feature that allows the two to synchronize settings, etc.The screen is crisp and the outer frame looks excellent. The TV has more than enough inputs to accommodate a large number of accessories. You can easily hook up multiple HDMI devices, which could be a serious concern on TVs with fewer inputs.The 120htz  Motion Plus feature is amazing for Sports, but new buyers should be aware of this feature when first using the TV to watch movies. The feature in essence increases the frame rate by extrapolating new frames by average the existing ones. The end result when watching sports is outstanding, but the default settings when I initially installed my Blu Ray player was quite jarring while viewing Blu Rays and DVDs. However, it was quite easy to adjust this setting once I realized what the problem was. Lowering the Blur Reduction and Judder reduction to around \u00be each produced an excellent quality for viewing movies.Overall this TV is a 10.

So far the LCD is working great and has exceeded my expectations.  The picture actually looks better than when I saw this model in the showroom at BB.  It's probably due to the fact that I dimmed the lights in our living room.Absolutely great picture when viewing Bluray off my PS3. I also hooked it up to my 3 yr old OPPO upconverting DVD player. Although not as good as the bluray picture, it was much better than I had expected and a big leap over the way it looked on my old 720P LCD. I think the biggest improvement is the 120Hz anti-blur motion control.  I was considering a 1080P 60Hz without motion control.  I am 100% glad that I shelled out some extra money for the 120HZ with Motion Control.  From what I have read, 120HZ by itself does not make much of a difference, but 120HZ combined with the mfg's internal motion control software makes the 120HZ a worth while feature.  So this is something to think about when comparing one brand 120HZ LCD to another brand 120HZ LCD.  Not all 120HZ panels are equal.BTW, my old LCD was a samsung LN-R328W purchased as a christmas present back in Dec, 2005 (4 years ago). Althought there is some miinor burn-in on a small area on this old LCD, it is still working great after 4 years. But this LN40B630 is a giant leap ahead of that old samsung in terms of picture quality (contrast and anti-blur).In addition, my hats off to Amazon/Crutchfield for my order.  I ordered it on Friday AM (black Friday after Thanksgiving), it shipped out on Saturday AM, I recieved a phone call and e-mail from Crutchfield notifying me of the shippment.

However, CEVA does the s&h; and their \"handling\" part of the deal is HORRIBLE! I waited one week just to have the TV shipped from AMAZON and CEVA took another week to deliver. I even called off work so that I did not have to wait another weekend to get my TV since the delivery was on Friday. I did not mind the wait since the shipping was free...but when it takes two weeks to get to my house and it comes with a big hole in the center of the screen, that really upsets me!The refund is going to take four weeks since I am not going to wait another month for a replacement. I told amazon that I would leave the order open IF the gave me express shipping but the denied my request. So here I am with no TV, and a cost under my credit card that is going to accumulate monthly interest for a product that I do not even own (because amazon takes so long to give a refund)I should have listened to the reviews of other customers that CEVA shipped damaged products. I know what you readers are thinking..\"Oh but it won't happen to me!\" Guess what? Yes it will.

My 40 inch Samsung LCD lasted just a little over 2 years. According to multiple internet sitesSamsung built a bunch of LCD TV's with bad capacitors that fail after a year or more (right after warranty is over).You can do a simple Google search and find many people who have had the same problems. After a year or two, the TV'sno longer turn on. Samsung has been made aware of this issue, but refuses to correct the problem. There are multiplesites that even tell you exactly how the problem is corrected. I am sure the number of people with this problem willincrease as time goes by. Even with the extended warranty, it is not worth the hassle of buying a large TV from acompany that does not support its products. I did a lot of research before choosing a Samsung, but since it wasearly in the production cycle, the problem did not appear.

But I don't have it. I ordered this tv on Oct. 8, 2009 with estimated delivery Oct.15, 2009. It was coming by Pilot and tracking showed it to be in Indianapolis, IN on Oct.9 and in Groveport, OH on Oct 12. Having heard nothing from anyone on Oct. 15, I e-mailed Pilot and did get a quick response saying that my tv was now with their home delivery company and gave me a phone number. I called and was told that it would  not be delivered until Oct. 21 or 22, when they are in my area. Keep in mind that I am less than two hours away from Groveport and Grove City, Oh where this second company is located. There was nothing I could say that would get my tv delivered any sooner. So, it is sitting less than 2 hours from my home for 10 days waiting on some lazy delivery company to bring it to me. I just hope the tv is everything all the other reviewers say it is when I get it, if I ever do.

I believe that review here should include the experience with Amazon and the delivery too.First of all, Amazon failed on the delivery issue here big time. And it's NOT \"CEVA\" fault. It took Amazon a week to deliver the TV to \"CEVA\"! The customer service at Amazon was also rude. He claimed it's my fault that I have selected the free delivery! Well, why Amazon offers that service if it can't deliver in a reasonable time? Technically I got the TV in 13 days. First time I have problems with Amazon.The TV is made by (SAMEX) in Tijuana, Mexico. Does anyone believe that \"in-home\" assembly is the same as \"third-party\" assembly? I doubt it. Well it will take a while to see the defaults. Amazon didn't disclose that TV is made by a third party though. Anyone have experience with this issue before?The panel is most likely \"A\" panel (The serial number starts with AUYK). I couldn't figure out the type of panel this TV have for sure. Anyone knows how to find out about that?So far the TV looks good.
