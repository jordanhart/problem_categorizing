''''''' Amazing!", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R1994EOBMZ6EC7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv to bring with me to college, and I must say that I am extremely happy with this purchase!  The screen is pretty vibrant and beautiful.  The TV itself is aesthetically pleasing as well, being very stylish with the bottom speakers.  It's also so incredibly thin!The TV: 22in LED LCD HDTV, for $200 had me sold! There is great value with this television.  I use it as a second monitor via HDMI cables, play computer games with it, and have plugged console games into it as well, and  everything looks as crisp and nice as other TVs.The volume, channel, etc buttons are on the right side of the tv, and they work well and are unintrusive.However, I admit that the speakers are sub-par to other televisions.  Although you shouldn't expect bose quality sound performance, the quality of the speakers are comparable to decent laptop speakers, but louder of course.  However, this could easily be remedied by plugging in a cheap $20 pair of external speakers if sound quality is of any importance to you.I've also noticed is that when viewed from below, the screen becomes somewhat dark!  So customers who wish to mount this tv high should be warned! However, the view from above, and sides are somewhat fine.Aside from the sound quality and slight view darkening, there aren't many gripes that I have with this TV. The value is astonishing, and it just looks great in general.  The TV comes in a box with a handle, so it doubles as a carrying case.  Included is also a remote, which functions fine and looks pretty cool, as well as a microfiber[?] cloth to wipe your screen with.All in all, I am sincerely satisfied!", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth a serious look. 1080p, great detail and fair audio, but room for improvement.,", "Author": "videobruce", "ReviewID": "R1WUGM22BVYAYF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After talking to Vizio to try to get a handle on their multitude of model numbers (they seem to have more TV's than HP has printers), at least with the \"E\" and the \"M\" versions, they are the same set, just meant to be sold in different markets. The 220VA (both sets) will apply to this review.I had a chance to do a side by side with a Samsung 22\" 1080 set (B2230HD) and to my surprise, this Vizio surpassed the Sammy in the detail department. Very noticeable when looking close up at faces or any other fine detail.The Sammy looked 'rolled off', soft compared to this. This is with the detail turned off (down to zero) on this set due to the excessive edginess to the image.Pros;1 1080p panel (most small sets under 32\" are 720's). Advantage: computer monitor,2. Excellent fine detail compared to a equivalent Samsung model,2. Better audio than most (though that might not be saying much) as long as the SRS features are OFF. Due to the larger area below the panel, larger speakers (1\"x 3\" ovals) are apparently used (see below),3. Separate component and composite inputs. (many sets combine both, you can only use one or the other),4. Direct input entry for many (not all) inputs: TV, composite, component & HDMI. The 2nd HDMI input takes a second press of that button (The VGA & USB input are only through the 'Input' button),4. USB input for some media types,5. Very low power consumption. 13 to 24 watts depending on backlight setting,6. Headphone jack with adjustable bass & treble (some sets defeat the adjustments when using headphones). Can power up small bookshelve speakers, but with very low output. Running 4 ohm speakers might make enough difference,7. Decent image quality (with sharpness set to zero and 'idiot' gimmicks turned off),8, Ambient light sensor seems to work ok,9. VGA input works fine for a computer monitor (HDMI does not, see below),10. Ability to add channels they were not in the original scan but, only one memory; OTA or CATV not both (as with most sets),11. Ability to custom edit the input and station names (& call letters). Not just set choices, but almost anything you want,12 Base (not really a stand) can be left on if wall mounting since it isn't visible from the front and doesn't protrude out the back very far.Cons;1. The supplied 'base' (not really a 'stand') is a 'mother' to insert into the bottom of the panel. Extra force is needed to slide it into the mating 'tabs'. It's obvious this is a source of problems and many complaints here,2. There is no separate 'enter' button for channel entry. One has to just press the desired number and wait three seconds for the tuner to change channels. This is annoying!,3. If the channel was not in the 'master channel list', you can't access it by direct entry. There is a 'add channel' scan though,4. It takes FIVE button presses just to access the buried picture controls! Something that should not be more than one or two presses, takes five,5. HDMI is unsuitable for a PC input. Best one can do is using 1776x1000 to achieve 1:1 pixel mapping (just scan) with a 1\" border around the desktop. Using any of the 'zoom' modes to 'fill' the screen destroys the mapping. The VGA has no problem and produces excellent text.6. 'Custom' picture settings are global. Set them for one input and all others have the same settings,7. Anything other than the 'Custom' setting, all the other picture modes have no adjustments available. Contrast, brightness, color, tint etc. are only available under 'Custom'. Really limits you here since other inputs may need different 'tweaking',8. Set powers down after a very short period of time with no input signal present; two minutes. A huge problem for PC use. When the computer goes to sleep or standby, the set shuts off. When you wake the PC, the TV doesn't sense the signal. You have to reboot the PC for the set to recognize the signal,9. Audio is fair. Far better than many, but still not up to the PQ level. The 'gimmicks' are a problem. SRS causes audio issues depending on the material. Leave both off!10. Remote leaves alot to be desired,11. Rear/side mounted panel controls. Hard to find, read & operate.The biggest outstanding issues are that base for the panel, picture settings, set shutting off too quickly, channel access, side/rear mounted controls and improving the audio.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Brand new model 1080p 22 Inch HD TV and it looks sharp!", "Author": "Scott Felten", "ReviewID": "RVS60ULTGR3C7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just picked up one of these new VIZIO's and I really like it! The 1080p picture is crisp, and the sound is great. I tried another 32 Inch VIZIO and hated it, plus it threw out a ton of heat. This tiny VIZIO is razor thin, yet provides a full bright picture and does not get hot. It hits 125 degrees out here, and I just fried my old Dell. Just as well, it got red hot, wasn't 1080p, but swiveled and adjusted. I resent these newer cheaper TV's don't offer this feature. The optimum viewing angle for me is off a little, however the previous Phillips 22 Inch HDTV I just returned turned into a negative if you weren't sitting directly in front of it. 200 glowing reviews here so I bought it and thought it looked worse than a 70's TV. Thank you Amazon for your excellent free 30 day return policy too. Since this is a new unit not even available for sale at the VIZIO site yet (\"coming soon\"), it is hard to compare pricing or reviews. However you can't go wrong with this Model.

When our bedroom TV croaked, I went to Amazon first to check prices on several 22\" TVs. Then Costco. But, since we were heading to town I figured I'd check Walmart which was right on our route. We found this exact TV model for over $55 LESS than the Amazon affiliate vendor. I often get the best deal on Amazon, but not this time.This is a fine small TV for a kitchen or bedroom. Clear and crisp picture. Lots of input/output options. Sharp looking. Front facing speakers are pretty good for a small TV.... not great sound, but what do you expect from a small package. The volume is better than our previous TV which had to be turned up all the way when used off the satellite... this one 75% volume is adequate without distortion.Setup was quick except I was a bit klutzy snapping in the base. But, once installed, the TV is very stable. I like the fact that the stand doesn't have a tall neck like our old one, keeps the TV flat on the table. The channel scan and other setup features worked perfectly. The only thing I don't especially like is the glossy trim about 1 inch wide around the edges... it reflects light from the windows and room. The matte screen handles reflections well.So this time, I am thankful for the info and reviews on Amazon, but very glad I didn't click the \"add to cart\" button too quickly.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does the job", "Author": "JO PA appreciates amazon", "ReviewID": "R26NGVFW8IHLFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I desperately needed a second monitor for my work laptop, its pretty difficult only using one screen.

I downgraded it 1 star, however, because the stand is difficult to put on.To install the stand do the following:1. Lay the TV down on a table on a pillow or other soft surface.2. Scoot the top of the TV up against a wall so that it won't move when you push on the stand.3. Insert the two bottom clips of the stand into the matching holes on the TV and then swivel the stand up so it is flat against the bottom of the TV and lift slightly so that the rest of the clips go into the matching holes.4. Push the stand firmly against the TV, and strike the edge of the stand sharply with the palm of your hand or the soft part of your fist.

I love it!  Since there were only two reviews on this specific set when I bought it, I took a bit of a chance relying on the multitude of reviews of one of the earlier (sister) models...I think it was the M220.  The two big negatives for the small Razors were the darkening of the screen at viewing angles below straight on and the audio quality.Like the other similar models, this one does darken if you try to view it from below head on.  Maybe the back-lighting does not extend across the bottom of the screen...I wouldn't know.  For me it was not an issue, since I needed to rig a way to tilt the TV forward anyway so it could be comfortably watched from the bed.  I just added another 4 degrees of down angle to compensate for the backward tilt built in to the set when sitting on its base (oh, yes, the base is a bit difficult to get on, but follow the directions, be persistent, and it will snap into place snugly).  For those who want to use the TV in a location that places it higher than the viewer's eyes, consider spending $15 for a swivel wall mount.  This set is so light that any wall should support it easily.As for the audio, it was indeed pretty bad when I first turned the set on.  But a few minutes with the easy-to-use on-screen menus took care of that so well I changed my mind about getting some external speakers to go with it (and we like good sound with our movies).I love the features of this little set!  All the right connections, nicely organized.  Terrific picture, and an excellent owner's manual.  Read it!  You may be really surprised how quickly it answers all your questions and points out features you probably would never have dreamed this little TV could offer!  The remote is very nice, too!If I had not been prepared to deal with the viewing angle issue, I'm sure I would not have considered rating it higher than 4 stars.  Although we have not gotten a great deal of use out of this TV yet, we have been very pleased with it.  For what it's worth, it scans for channels fairly quickly (which is important when you're in a different broadcast area every couple of days), and we noticed that its tuner picked up probably two or three times more channels as our main TV using the same digital over-the-air antenna.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelent TV!

For under 200$ it was the best option, sorry they already made it more expensive!UPDATE: The sound is awful... I think it's broken or something because it sounds just like a cheap speaker when you turn the volume on.

The power light indicator would come on but there were no other signs of life in the television. I researched the internet and found that it is a common problem with these TV's. I applied the suggested power button reset procedure and it did work -- once. It worked fine for the first few days after the procedure, then the original problem of lifelessness returned (and stayed with me).I called the company about the issue and was assisted by a lovely and very professional representative. I was told, however, that the procedure I implemented was the only solution she would have recommended. Additionally, I was told that, since the warranty had expired, Vizio has a \"Tough Poopie\" policy because the TV's they make are very technically complex pieces of equipment and these things happen.In all fairness to the company, I do have the exact same television in another room and it works very well. I would have liked to have seen the company provide me with at least *something* other than \"you are on your own\" after having spent in excess of $200.00 of my money on a product that should have lasted 10 years but only gave me one year of service for my investment. I am unlikely to buy and certainly will not recommend Vizio to anyone. Our society seems to be plummeting into an abyssmal \"WalMart Economy\" where people are not important and making more money governs all.....but I digress....If Vizio wants to redeem themselves (a replacement TV would be acceptable) I would be happy to remove this review and the others I have posted throughout the internet.

The light was on but the tv had no picture or sound (the only two things I expect in a tv) I called to get it repaired or replaced and vizio would not.

RCA's 24\" LED24A45RQ, sold be Sears, is typical - great picture, but sounds like a tiny radio in a tin can, with treble on max.Vizio Razor's are the only TVs in this size range with speakers facing forward (they are beneath the screen).  It's not high fidelity, but there's plenty of volume, it's realistic sounding, and perfectly satisfactory.I ordered an EM220VA and a 3-year warranty from Walmart's web site and picked it up at the store 3 hours later.

The TV is stable when on the stand, but it leans back at a fixed 5 degree angle; i.e., it's not adjustable.

The headphone jack puts out a low level hiss that is much less noticable at higher volumes but at points of silence can be heard.  #2) Visio doesn't include much in the way of an owner's manual...  Not a big deal unless you're not a techy or need to troubleshoot a problem.  #3) The two HDMI inputs are located directly beneath the VESA mounting holes so depending on the mount you intend to use (such as a 75-100mm Universal) you may find one or both unusable.  In my case, my mount is a swiveling pole mount with a 75-100mm plate which mostly obstructs the top HDMI port and somewhat blocks the second.

I had purchased a Westinghouse a couple years back and had to stand right by it to hear anything. As the name says...We sting ho use...After that, I purchased a VIZIO (221model) 22\" Razor led lcd tv. I found out that you don't lay it down in the back seat of your car and drive down the road...I broke the lcd when it bounched on the seatbelt connection.

I purchased it \"used/like new\" here on Amazon from an amazing seller and wow, how I love this TV!!!I've been using it for over a week now. Sleek, stylish, lightweight and the picture quality is *fantastic*!!!! I was using the apt building's rooftop HD antenna and ugh how miserable that was. I refuse to pay some horrid cable company 22+ bucks just for reception. So I hooked a Philips antenna up to this tv instead of using the rooftop and am thrilled with the combination.This TV is so easy to set up that even an electronics manuals hater like me was able to do it in a few minutes. Some complain about the remote but I love this remote! The buttons make sense, are placed sensibly and after an hour I was able to do all I needed to do with the remote by touch only. Unlike my last old old old tv's remote that had a hundred buttons that I never did figure out or use.The screen menu to set up inputs, channel scans, color, tint, etc are wonderfully simple and elegant. Finally, something made well and that's simple to use.Absolutely fabulous! So glad I took my time looking around before purchasing. Appreciate all the reviews here which definitely did sway me.

I'm totally confused.I bought mine in December 2011 (from Walmart---I'm starting to think maybe all the defective units just happened to be shipped there because another reviewer had the same issue 8 months after purchasing this from there) and in late June of this year it stopped working. I tried to turn it on with the remote as well as the power button on the side but got no response. The situation is so bizarre.Also, the length of time that Vizio takes to resolve and repair the TV is unbelievably long. As at the time of writing this review, my TV is still in their repair depot despite them having received it since 7/2/2012 and all I keep hearing is conflicting messages from their customer service agents as to when it shall be repaired and shipped back. Had I known that other units were having this same issue I would have stayed away. After this experience, I highly doubt I'll ever buy a Vizio product again.**Update** 7/27/2012:After sending a couple of tweets to Vizio Support on 7/25/2012, whoever was tweeting from that account actually made the effort to contact the warehouse to get an update. My TV was finally shipped on 7/26/2012 and is scheduled to arrive on 2/8/2012. Bear in mind they've had it in their possession since 7/2/2012.Well, I'm finally getting my TV back so shouldn't I be happy? Not particularly, especially after I discovered that a few people had their repaired units break down a second time with the same issue. I'm completely dissatisfied with this product and I intend to get rid of the repaired unit as soon as possible.I would advise anyone considering buying this to stay away. Very. Far.

Where I ran into trouble is when I connected my dvd player to the Vizio with a video component  cable (red, blue green connectors) and found I could only display a black and white picture.  I contacted Vizio and after exploring all options I was told my unit was defected.  I returned it to Walmart for a refund and purchase the same model from Costco and installed it with the same result.  I again contacted Vizio and they wanted to replace or repair this unit.  I believe there is a design problem with this model.  I do get color if I use the connection on the side of this unit with a red, white and yellow RCA connection to the dvd player.

Connected to a roof-top over-the-air antenna, the picture quality on the VIZIO does not come close to the quality of my Panasonic plasma TV.  In fact, the VIZIO picture was far inferior to that provided by an eight-year-old Panasonic in my office connected to rabbit-ears, as well as an ancient 15\" Magnavox in the kitchen that this TV was purchased to replace.  After a couple of days of tweaking and adjusting, I finally threw in the towel.  Blacks and whites were rendered exceptionally, but I found it impossible to render the subtleties of faces and human skin realistically.  Also, I was unable to eliminate a pervasive graininess.  My suspicion is that the good reviews originate with owners who have cable, satellite, or fiber-optic sources, and that the VIZIO is unable to provide acceptable video using an over-the-air antenna.Based on my research, this Vizio and a discontinued Samsung were the only prospective candidates for a small (22\" or less) TV that provides both decent video and audio.

Upon opening I discovered there was only a \"quick start guide\" and no full user manual.  Not a big deal, right?I attempted to install the base so that it could rest on my dresser.  BIG MISTAKE!  The base is really difficult to install.  The quick start guide didn't help at all and neither did the instructions online.  During my attempt at installation I snapped two plastic tabs off of the base.  I called Vizio customer service and was put through to a real, breathing, English speaking human in a very short amount of time (BONUS!).  She proceeded to tell me that this is a known design issue on these TVs.  She checked to see if I could get a new base.  I certainly could however Vizio wouldn't cover under warranty.  REALLY?!!  That's a bunch of bull.  She said it was my fault and not a manufacturing flaw (even though she said it is a known issue).  Fortunately there are several more tabs that are bigger and play a role in supporting the TV.  I was able to install the base and all was well.The picture and sound quality are good, not great.
