{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just Released model, chose over Samsung", "Author": "Carol A. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1NFYGWSIDM72B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We had just enough room for this model to fit in home office in crowded area.Fits over the top of the Monitors.We selected this because one it was a new thin model, had a razor sharp display and tons of features. Many lower priced TV are older models with thick chunky look and less features The sellers just want to blow them out the door. Planned on buying a Samsung as picture is usually better on them than an old  Magnavox. But this one looks to be the beginning of better product line from them.  Got to say we were impressed. Granted it is the only TV we own that's not a plasma. Once we hooked it up and tuned it in, we were rewarded with a near perfect display.PROS: new thin style, SRS sound, HDMI ready, PC ready, lots of adjustments for picture,features and sound. I have HP laptop hooked to it an works works great as a monitor, Clean video, decent sound, head phone jacks/external speaker 3.5mm. PC mode has clean text near perfect ,monitor from 4/feet out.We also used for DVD and HDMI out from Asus Transformer Tablet. Plus all the HD and Blue Ray dics and clean picture quality from Direct TV set top box.I have not owned an LED before. You can see the blemishes on other actors faces, a little too well, yuk.Nice overall,monitor & TV.3 HDMI ports, USB, serial port as and RCA inputs. For $258 is is the latest model out for them and it shows'Cons:Smudges easily but that's not uncommon. We have it mounted on wall swing pivot swing bracket.Sound is average so added a little pair of Bose speakers for $69 from Sams and it's sounding really tight with sweet Bass.So far I would say we bought the best $250 LED out there.Signed happy watcher/user.I confess we bought at Sams Club' but they were $60 cheaper then Amazon and they we such a new model, there were no reviews as of yet.We used the $60 to buy the fancy wall bracket and money toward the speakers. Nice to use headphones is you don't wish to bother the other person the other person in the room.Cheers", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazon's misrepresentation of this product.", "Author": "John McGowen \"New Tech\"", "ReviewID": "R1GL5ZAHMDT0CE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have never felt that Amazon was misguiding it's customers until now.

After ordering another brand set, and returning it because of my hearing impairment which did not permit me to hear through the headphone jack...the sound was hardly audible to me, I ordered this Magnavox set. It is wonderful on ALL counts!  The picture is sharp; the color is vivd, and the sound, through the earphone jack, is just what I need. Even the picture on the regular tv choice, is very good, and the HDMI choice is outstanding.  I could not be happier with my purchase. I am grateful to Amazon for permitting me to return my first set, and changing it for this one.  It was a pleasure to work with them. It is too bad that more manufacturers don't include a headphone jack feature.

I was the first person to open the box. I mounted it on the wall and it has been used exactly 1.75 times. My stepdaughter watched a movie on it three weeks ago. Thursday, she watch 3/4s of a movie when the screen went black. Tried other outlets and it still will not work. I contacted Magnavox customer service and was told that, according to the serial number, the tv was out of warranty. SO, I have a product whose manufacturer does not honor its responsibility to stand behind defective products. Keep this in mind if you are thinking about buying from Magnavox. They told me that I would have to get it repaired. I am just going to throw this worthless product away and just purchase a new TV from a reputable manufacturer.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "tv plays great.....but i noticed the speakers vibrate when the bass it set on high", "Author": "Brian Gore", "ReviewID": "R3OCCBLQM0AM0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great picture came factory sealed brand new.... very happy wkith the tv i have it in my bedroom.... hook up was easy", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Grandson's Birthday present - Great buy", "Author": "KKrull", "ReviewID": "RBN65JILCW52E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is absolutely fantastic.
