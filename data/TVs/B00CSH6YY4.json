However, if you are like me (a few months ago) and are in need of a second TV for the bedroom or small apartment then this TV is more than adequate for your needs! However, do not buy this TV over $600 dollars, because it often goes on sale and can be had for less than $500. So keep an eye out.Picture QualityDecent at best, but again this is a high-end entry level TV! It is a 60hz TV, but its actually not too bad. It's not too bad for video games either as it provides a very clear, crisp picture.SoundAll LEDTVs have horrible speakers, so you'll probably want to invest in some stereo speakers to go with it.InputsI only use hdmi and vga/dvi, and this TV has it!Would I recommend this TV to a friend? Yes, if they were looking for an average TV.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great / awesome pic quality and super thin", "Author": "musicman27pa", "ReviewID": "R2LGYVV22G1SS9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very impressed with the picture quality and very nice on our bedroom wall.Really like the fact that it is under 2\" deepThe sounds is OK (typically flat screen sound) but overall very happy with the TV and makes a nice addition to our home.  power consumption is much better than LCDs/Plasma's and looks great even when the room is pretty bright.Also have had lots of reliability with Sharp LED's as we have had one in our gym and living room for the past few years without any issues.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't Even Think About Buying a Sharp TV!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R3M23X9HKOBO3H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First let me state that I made the mistake of buying this TV through Sears because of a sale.  I will never buy through Sears again and you'll see why after my story.I bought this TV in June 2013.  We unpacked it and plugged it in and started watching.  As we were watching the TV would turn off then come back on.  I tried adjusting all the \"power saving\" options to no avail.  The TV continued to turn off and on while watching.  I called Sears who immediately wanted to start the repair process.  I told them the TV basically never worked so I wanted a replacement TV.  The processed the request and I received a replacement TV within about 2 weeks.The second TV seemed to work OK for about 2 months then started randomly powering off.  We were away most of the summer so we didn't use the TV frequently.  It would have probably failed within the first week if we would have given it normal use. When the TV powered off, while watching it mind you, it was impossible to turn the TV back on.  Neither the remote control, the power button, nor unplugging and replugging it in would make it come back on.  You would have to let it set for an undetermined amount of time before it would power back on.  I called Sears who gave me the run-around for 10 minutes pretending they were going to help me then told me it was past 30 days so I would have to call Sharp customer support.Let me start by saying \"Sharp customer support\" is an oxymoron.  The support is not sharp, it's not support, it's not even remotely geared for the customer.  So at this point I've had a TV for about 5 weeks that I paid around $900 for and I haven't been able to use.  Was I frustrated?  Yes.  The Sharp customer support person immediately ignored everything to do with the history of my experience and had me do the \"is the TV turned on\" type of interrogation.  I understand this is necessary and went along with the process.  The tech support person then told me that it was my fault and I had the \"power saving\" options set so the TV would turn off.  I repeatedly asked him if there was such a power saving option that would turn the TV off WHILE you were watching the TV.  To this day I can't find any of those options on the TV.  I also confirmed that all \"power saving\" options were off BEFORE I called the Sharp customer support.  The tech support person then told me I was wrong and that if they sent out a technician I would be charged.  I told the tech support person I was done with them and wanted to speak to a supervisor.  I got a supervisor on the phone and explained the entire situation again.  The arranged for a service call from a \"Sharp authorized factory repair\" provider.  The repair company scheduled an appointment to come look at the TV which was about 2 weeks out.  So now I've been without the TV for about 3 months.I worked with the \"Sharp authorized factory repair\" provider through four attempts to fix the TV.  These four attempts to fix the TV took about 3 months.  The last attempt to fix the TV left the TV in the state of the very first TV we received.  The TV would randomly turn off then back on.  With each repair, the repair service company told me they were working with Sharp and doing everything that Sharp was telling them to do in order to repair the television.  Also, each time they had to order parts from Sharp, the process would take 3-4 weeks to get new parts.So after 5 months of this hell with the Sharp TV, I finally called Sharp and told them I wanted a new TV.  They told me because I bought it through Sears they could only give me a refurbished TV.  Sure enough, I checked the warranty and there is a statement in there that says they can do that at their discretion.  So I had gone 5 months without a TV that I bought for $900 and now they were going to give me a refurbished TV as a replacement that probably would have cost about $400.  I argued and argued with them and finally relented to taking they refurbished TV.The then informed me that they didn't have any of my model TVs in stock and would replace it with a last year's model LC52LE640U that was refurbished.  So now I was going to receive a year old model that was refurbished.  I asked them if I had any choice and they said basically \"take it or leave it\".  So I was forced to take this year old refurbished TV.They told me on 11/26/2013 that my TV would arrive via FedEx in 5-7 days.  I didn't receive a TV but instead received an email 12/12/2013 saying that I had received my TV and to use the attached label to ship the other back or they would charge my credit card full price for the TV.  I called Sharp and asked them what was going on saying I had NOT received a TV.  They said that email didn't mean they had shipped the TV and it was automatically generated from their system.  Here's the text from that email.\"By now you have received your Sharp replacement unit for an exchange, please print out the attached FedEx ground label to return your defective unit.\"Here's Sharp's followup email to my inquiry.\"Your replacement unit has not been shipped. The email you received is a general email that is sent after your order is processed, which it has been and your unit will ship once there is inventory. Your credit card is not being charged. Once you received your replacement, please use the label to send your original unit.\"On 12/19/2013 my son tripped on a large box on our front porch as he left the house.  The TV was left on our door step with no warning that it was even shipped from Sharp.I was also told I would be given a box to ship back the old TV.  The box the replacement TV was sent in had a bottom that was held on by packaging straps.  These straps had to be cut to remove the TV.  So the box was not usable to ship the TV back.  I called Sharp and a supervisor told me to take the bottom of the box.  I asked if I was going to be liable if the TV dropped out of the bottom of the box.  His reply was to contact FedEx and ask them about their packaging guidelines.  Are you kidding me?  After all the crap Sharp put me through and now I'm responsible for packaging up their crap?  Unbelievable.After the FedEx guy picked up the old non-functional TV that couldn't be repaired with the bottom of the box taped on, I thought the ordeal was hopefully over for a while.  I then kept getting messages from Sharp to call their customer service.  I did so and they said they had shipped a box for me to return the TV in.  I told them that their supervisor, and gave them his name, told me to tape the  bottom of the box up and that's what I had done.  I also told them that the old TV was in route via FedEx and I was tracking it.  The asked if I had the tracking number.  I asked, \"You mean the tracking number on the label that you sent me?\".  So they didn't even know the tracking number of the label that had sent me to use.After 5 1/2 months without a TV Sharp told me they would still only give me 6 1/2 months on the replacement previous year's model refurbished TV.Unless you like being tortured and abused by a company that doesn't comprehend customer service, DO NOT BUY A SHARP TV OR ANY SHARP PRODUCT.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Average", "Author": "justin c hinkley", "ReviewID": "R23QDZ42A9XSAZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I picked up this TV at our local electronics store over the weekend. It wasn't my first choice, I'd actually decided on their house brand TV [made by LG] but everytime I got one home it had issues (either busted screen or missing parts, etc). So the AV manager at this store \"upgraded\" me to this Sharp at a substantially reduced cost. For around 400 dollars I thought it was a pretty good value on a brand name I recognized. I wasn't able to see a display model function before bringing it home nor could I review what connectors it had, so this is with a grain of salt as they say...Unfortunately though, I have been less than impressed with it. I found the picture to be not very clear, movies display a little dark, and the pre-canned calibration options are horrible. No reviews of this model on CNET, and no user forums with any insight on calibration settings so I'm in uncharted waters here. The speakers are completely inadequate, par for the course with these slim TVs these days so no surprise there...but(!), this TV also lacks one output that is considered standard on most larger flat TVs; the Optical Audio output. It does have a RCA jack labelled \"Digital Audio Output\" which after researching is still an S/PDIF format (same as Optical), but utilizes the Sony/Phillips form factor connection instead of the standardized Toslink (Optical Audio) connector. Way to go Sharp! Why Sharp is using the Sony/Phillips connector in their brand TV is beyond rediculous to me. My Sony home theater receiver, PS3, and Panasonic DVD & VHS players all have Toslink Optical audio jacks on them...but not the Sharp TV. So at this point I'm looking at having to buy a $25 RCA to Toslink adapter, or a new home theater receiver, or return this TV despite the great deal I received.I would caution anyone looking at this generation of Sharp Aquos TVs to thoroughly review what it has to offer and compare it against what you actually have at home.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$849.99", "Features": "1080p LED display for breathtaking HD images\n50\", ultra slim, edge-lit design\nPowerful 20W audio for high fidelity with clear voice\nOptical Picture Control (OPC)\n60Hz refresh rate", "Name": "Sharp AQUOS LC-50LE442U 50\" Class 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tj5ANENML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CSH6YY4"}}
