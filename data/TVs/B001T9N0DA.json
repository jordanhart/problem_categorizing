I purchased this television from Best Buy, and was happy with it until I noticed the auto-dimming feature.  After reading about it online, I've noticed tons of people having the same issue.  Fortunately it can be fixed (relatively) easily.  All you need is a compatible flash drive (you can check the Sony Support website for a list of compatible flash drives - I used 4 GB Sony Micro Vault), and a PC.  From there you simply go to the Sony Support website and download the update/patch for the TV which completely eliminates the auto-dim feature.  I got the link by accessing the chat service on the Sony Support site.  The PC part is important; If you have an Apple computer, you won't be able to successfully install the update.  I implore anyone who has issues with the auto-dim feature to download the update - it gets rid of the problem.Pros:  Great value; contrast ratio; 1080p; 40 inch screen.Cons: Without the update/patch there is the auto-dim feature; only 60hzOverall:  I loved the TV at first, then hated it when I noticed the auto-dim, now love it again now that I downloaded the update.

Overall I am not disappointed.  Being a relatively newer model reviews were hard to come by and the one review I found was here on Amazon and it was a bad review.  It mentioned the Auto contrast feature included on the Bravia models and complained that during some movies it would darken too much and make the flick unwatchable.  I have watched quite a few movies at this point and have not noticed it to be a problem except for maybe during opening credits.I also Game alot on this tv,  My 360 and PS3 look amazing through the HDMI and even my Wii looks pretty good(as good as a Wii can look).  This is a great tv and the only thing I would change is the Auto Contrast.  It has an option to turn it off, but switching it to off doesnt turn it of..

This series of Sony HDTV is the \"S\" series which is Sony's lower end model (they have a \"V\" and \"W\" also).  For the price-point (under six fifty) the pic quality is not bad.  The sound using HDMI is also fine as far as volume goes.  Granted, the tone quality (richness) is not very good but none of the speakers on these HDTV's are.  Contrary to other reviews, I found the speakers to be above average.However, I really can't recommend this tv because the update (fix) did not fix anything for me.  The color shifting remains after the update and I have tried 2 of these tvs now.  Sony support has been fairly good but in the end they haven't fixed anything yet.  If you are considering this tv, please read online for complaints for the S and V series.  People mention the color shift and noise poping even after the updates so while the update may work for some people, clearly it is is not for others.  I really have spent much too much time on this.  I really wish I had just purchased a different TV even if it meant doing so at a higher cost.  If you do decide to get this tv, make sure you get a really good price on it!!Finally, the picture on this tv is pretty good and I don't doubt that the software fix work for some people.  If it had worked for me I would have given this tv 4 stars.  The fact that I've had this problem with 2 Sony's now just makes me question this model  (also, I didn't mention that I have tried different hdmi cable as well as swapped out my cable box thinking these might be the cause).All I am saying is do your research and \"buyer be informed.\"One last thing I will mention, because I haven't seen it mentioned in any of the other reviews is about the Sony recommended memory cards for the update.  Even if you don't have a card on their list try the one you have BUT MAKE SURE you format it first as suggested in their instructions (FAT32).  I only had a 128mb card (not on their list) and it didn't work.  I noticed the Fat32 instructions and tried that and the update ran perfectly.I hope this has been helpful.*********UPDATE**********I agreed to let Sony send me a 3rd tv.  I had doubts that a 3rd would be much diff. than the first 2 but I didn't have many options.  A new tv was sent to me by Sony in a decent time with all the return info I needed so I could send the bad unit back (at no charge to me).  Sony's return service and support has been good.  However, that is all I can say that is good.The 3rd unit has most of the same issues plus some sound issues.  I have spent so much time dealing with this Tv.  I really regret it.  FORTUNATELY, I bought it from a place with a 90-day return policy.  I took it back after just over 60 days.  Good rid-dens.  I STRONGLY recommend against this model in the \"S\" series (Sony's low end).", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "one of the best sony bravia tvs", "Author": "M.

It's a nice TV except it has this feature called auto-dimming.  During dark scenes, the TV dims the screen (presumably to preserve the longevity of the screen).  Unfortunately, this feature makes it impossible to see dark images.  The general consensus is that Sony treats this as a feature, not a flaw.  Nonetheless, they finally relented and offered a patch.  My girlfriend and I downloaded the patch, which made the dimming less drastic, but still present and noticeable.

Couldn't discern any difference in quality between this and other expensive (120Hz, higher dynamic contrast ratio) models in the store and at $600, didn't feel need to go for the generic brands.... The setup was breeze - the remote is intuitive to be used without refering to manual. I am still waiting to get my Sony Blu ray player from Amazon so have not tested that video functionality yet. Was really surprised by the picture quality from the standard def DVD from SD home theater (w/o upconvert feature) connected via S-video cable. The night/dark scenes were really dark and overall picture qaulity was excellent. Can't wait to see how better the blu ray picture would be. Another note on picture quality - the TV is in a room where there is sunlight. When the TV is on there is no reflection seen on the LCD itself while the bevel surface surface does show reflection. The TV display somehow gets rid of all the sunlight reflection - really impressed by this. Also, no issues with the auto dim feature - have not changed any default settings so may be it's true new models have the problem fixed.

I am by no means an expert when it comes to flat panel TV's.I did not buy from this site. One of the national clubs has a better return policy. I purchased this TV and a 42 inch JVC.  I am returning the JVC.  The Sony controls and remote (although not multifunction)are superior in most aspects. I purchased both the JVC and Sony at the same time.Most of what I have to say are based on using QAM on Comcast (no cable box).  With the switch to all digital I found that Comcast in my area (northern suburb of Chicago) has put the digital starter stations on QAM. This means if you have a QAM digital tuner on the TV you can get these stations. Almost all large screen TV's have QAM.The Sony found the stations (about 100 of them) and put them in a fairly logical order.  I had to go through each QAM station and label them through \"managing stations\". I will have to make a cheat sheet showing which station is which. I have not seen any reviews that address the time it takes to change stations.  The Sony changes stations much faster than the JVC.It appears to be viewable in a brightly lit room. At night it is very bright.  I have not modified any of the settings - yet.I have not yet noticed the problems with the dimmer function that a lot of people have complained about, perhaps I have the update.It does not in my opinion manage the switching between wide screen and 4:3 very well.  It seems like I am always changing the settings depending on what I am watching.  The JVC did a better job.The JVC had an Ipod dock.  My teenage sons really like this they were disappointed when I told them I was returning it.If I was only using the tv through a cable box I don't know that wouldn't be more favorable toward the JVC.

First of all, The HDMI inputs didn't work all the time. Periodically when turning the TV on, there is a picture but no sound, or sound and no picture. Reseating the HDMI cable fixes it temporarily. The TV also pops loudly and reboots itself 3 or 4 times a week. Sony farms out repair to a local company and the local guy said Sony has had problems with direcTV DVR's. He called Sony and they authorized replacing the main board and power supply. This did fix the HDMI problems but not the loud popping and reboooting. Another repair call required replacement of the LCD panel. After waiting another 2 weeks for this, the replacement panel wouldn't even turn on so he had to put the old panel back in. Sony then said they would replace the TV and I'd be called within 3 days. This is when the real trouble started. I got a garbled message requesting I fax my original purchase receipt to a toll number in Florida. I couldn't make out the number and the rep left no call back. The next day, I had another garbled message but managed to get the phone number and some of my \"reference number\" out of the message. The next day I got a third call saying the information was incomplete - now they want the retailer's name and address even though the first 2 messages didn't ask for that. Again, no call back number was given. Sony's website doesn't list any toll free numbers, either, so I had to pay to talk to them. That's when I found out the Florida number just bouces to a call center in the Phillipines. Eventually, they got the information (that they already had) and called a week later, leaving another toll number for me to call. This time, they offered to sell me the latest Sony TV at a cost of 300 dollars more OR a refurbished TV. Considering I bought a NEW TV and it didn't work from the beginning, I wasn't too happy. Sony only offers new replacement within the first 30 days, even though any intermittent problem will NEVER be resolved within that time, so everybody gets a used one for replacement. The rep also flat out refused to give me a supervisor, anyone at corporate office or anyone other than him when I asked. Long story short, the \"new\" used TV arrived and broke within 1 day.

The picture on that is the best I've ever seen.  Therefore, this purchase was a Sony and I'm amazed at the picture quality. I hooked it up myself initially and no problems at all with the operation. Simple to operate, no problems with any dimming.  I would highly recommend this TV. I only hope it lasts half as long as the old RCA but I doubt they make them like that anymore.

I've had some excellent TVs over the years from Sony, including a 42\" LCD that I purchased in 2008 with great results.  However, this set has had issues from the beginning that were not resolved by the patch and numerous calls to Sony's tech help service.  The problem with the auto dimming feature only bothers me some of the time but what is perhaps the most irritating is the terrible internal speakers with this unit.  It really gets mushy sound performace and I will eventually have to connect it to an outside receiver to get past this issue.  After the patch did nothing to correct the problems I had this in a Sony repair facility for two weeks to replace parts and make things right with the picture and the sound.  Upon return, it was simply more of the same.  I've noticed that Amazon is no longer selling this model.  Maybe they've recognized the issues.  For those that are getting good performance, you're the lucky ones.  This will be the last time that I buy a TV on reputation alone, sight unseen.

Each one had issues within 2-5 days. We took all four (4) back based upon the advice of Sony Technicians, and I tried to call Sony to seek help. I spent a total of 4 1/2 hours over 5 days on the phone, mostly on hold, waiting to talk to a person. I finally was told \"that is beyond our control, you need to talk to someone in Customer Relations.\"  FYI, if you try to call Customer Relations at 1-239-768-7547, which by the way is the number that is listed on Sony's web-site, the first thing you will notice is it is a \"long distance call.\"  The second thing you will notice is you will be on hold for a minimum of 30 minutes waiting to talk to someone.  The third thing you will find is that you aren't calling Sony Customer Relations at all.You are calling Product Support, who will ask you dozens of the same question, until you have wasted more of your day and money on the long distance call.  Only after you get so angry you are ready to spit nails do they say \"you need to talk to someone in Sony Customer Relations.\"  Then the fun really begins as Sony Customer Relations is only open on Monday through Friday.  On top of that they are never available, and you will be on hold for another 30 or more minutes.  Someone may finally get on the line, but each time in my case it was the person I just talked to and they suggested I call back the next day.  When I refused they said the Customer Relations Staff was very busy, and could not get to my call.  Geez, I wonder why?  Could it be because their products are junk?See the pattern here?  And, after your blood pressure is sky high, then you will have a person come on the phone and tell you that \"Sony does not compensation Customers for time and inconvenience.\"  Anyone else see the problem here?  The sad part is we were willing to try the new Sony KDL40 EX400, but we asked Sony to send us a $40.00 set of the Sony HDMI cables for our tv at no charge, as they are unavailable at the stores in our areas.  Sony was only willing to allow us to \"buy the cables from them.\"  Apparently they do not care about their Customers.  I told them that I no longer buy Sony, and I will make sure no one else makes the same mistake.  They kept apologizing, but not one person was willing to step up and do something to fix the problems \"they\" caused.This company isn't the Sony you and I grew up with.
