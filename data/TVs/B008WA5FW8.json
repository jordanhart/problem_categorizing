{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DONT buy a Westinghouse TV", "Author": "earth2earl", "ReviewID": "R1V03PD8QTF8DS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My first Westinghouse TVs power source went out at 11 months of the 1 year warenty.  They sent a replacement, the LD-4695 (46inch LED). Out of the box the screen had 3 areas of white fog on the edges.  Then after 3 months with this TV 2/3rds of the screens refresh rate went bad.  The problem also could be the panel.  Most of the screen became a digital soup of blur and dim colors.  This new TV has no waranty, which ended with the original 1 year warenty.I tried to call customer service 3 times and select the \"customer service\" menu option.  After being on hold waiting for 5 minutes I then get disconnected, each time.I thought I was getting a fair deal at $650 but that turned into 100% a waste of my money.Best Buy should stop selling these RIP OFF T.V.s", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bleeding Edge... In a Bad Way", "Author": "J. Abdul \"Gray Fox\"", "ReviewID": "R3THQF0KKSM4PJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from a Brandsmart in GA. The picture looked great in the showroom, and the price was great (about $449, which I then managed to talk the salesman down to $409). I was initially skeptical of the TV because I didn't know anyone who owned a Westinghouse TV, but since the salesman was very passionate about it, plus I have had positive experiences with a pair of 21\" monitors I bought, I thought, what the heck.  Well, as soon as I got it set up, along the top edge of the screen, I noticed 3 or 4 white glows, evenly spaced, like a closet door not quite shut all the way.  When the TV was displaying things bright and colorful, you couldn't see it, but I watched Lincoln on it, and while the picture quality was good, the pockets of white along the top were a distraction. It was like someone tried to pry the set open, and the LED lights that line the border were seeping out, and couldn't be sealed off. I packed it up, returned it, and got a JVC, which has been very good so far.  I cannot recommend this TV, even though mine may have been a bad apple. If you are starting off with low brand value, you have to exceed expectations when you get your shot, and Westinghouse failed to do that.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy

One day, it just didn't turn back on. I called customer service several times and got disconnected. When I finally spoke with someone they said they were sending an email to me with instructions on how to return the TV. I didn't receive the email and called back again to get disconnected, several times, after waiting, several minutes.  It took them a couple of days but they sent the email.  I had to purchase a box to send the unit to them which cost me over $40.  Shipping was $60.  Yesterday I received the replacement TV.  It is a different television set. I purchased an LD-4695 and this one was originally an LD-4680.  They gave it a refurbished item number but my search provided a link.  The screen has clouds and dark spots that come and go after a channel has been on for about 10 minutes.  It happens on every channel.I am so upset.  I sent an email to customer service last night with a couple of videos. I attached one of the videos here.  I want a full refund.  I don't want a broken TV.  It is not what I purchased and it is not my fault the first TV was garbage too.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Missing parts", "Author": "Akeem Mclennon", "ReviewID": "R3MTE1SSJBTD10", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this at Best Buy because it was on clearance for $399.

It took Westinghouse nearly 3 months to get the replacement to us. 3 bloody months! When the replacement finally arrived [this LD-4695], the bezel was broken out of the box AND the tv wouldn't stay on for more than a few minutes before turning off. The box was not damaged or deformed, so I can only assume that the television was broken when it was placed in the box to begin with.Support is nonexistent. Good luck if you can get a hold of them through any of their support numbers. When you do, you have to start from ground zerio all over again.Based on the other horrible reviews (which I should have checked before buying the original television at Sam's Club last year), it really looks like a case where we should file a class action lawsuit.
