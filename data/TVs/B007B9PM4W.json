It offers many of the options of the higher price sets (such as the high-end Samsung 8000 series), but lacks the pricier cutting edge technology (Such as the motion and voice control). Through-out the video portion of this review reference the LG LM6700, which is at a a similar price point.Notes-Picture Quality - It took some tweaking, but once I had it properly set-up the picture quality was very good. The picture is crisp (which you would expect from any 1080P set), but it also offers better brightness than our LG LM6700. The LG always seems a little dark, but the Samsung 6500 offers better overall brightness, and to me, it makes the picture *look* better. One other thing, until I got the picture adjusted properly, I did notice some color blooming which subtracted from the overall picture sharpness... never fear, this can be adjusted out. Some people may also be concerned with the 120Hz refresh.... I also own the Samsung 8000,and my version is 240Hz, and I don't notice any difference. I guess the only time it maybe noticeable is while watching a 3D Blu-ray.3D- The Samsung 6500 comes with 2 pairs of active (read *battery operated*) 3D glasses. Using the Samsung 6500 to convert 2D to 3D works, ok, but it will not take your breath away. I used it to watch a baseball game, and \"Men in Black\" and while I noticed the difference - it was not dramatic. The LG LM6700 uses passive glasses, and to me, seems to have better 2D to 3D capability.Sound - Again, it took some adjustments to get the integrated speakers to sound the way I wanted. It required me to turn the surround setting on, and play around with the set-up. One thing to note, is that out-of-the-box, the Samsung 6500 makes a clicking noise every time you raise or lower the volume. This is pretty annoying, but it can be disabled.Features - This is what separated the Samsung 6500 from some of the pricier models, but to me, it really doesn't matter. The Samsung comes with a nice programmable remote, plenty of applications (Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube, Pandora,...although Amazon is noticeably absent). However, as I mentioned it does not come with the voice and motion control of the Samsung 8000 series. The Samsung 6500 offer \"Family View\" and Fitness channels... but in all honesty, I really have not used them. In terms of features, the LG LM6700 has very similar features - but they are better organized and easier to use.Back Panel - I mention it in the video portion, but the Samsung 6500 offers 3 HDMI inputs (which is enough for a Game device, DVR, and Blu-Ray... or some other combination), 1 component input, 0 (zero) RCA and S-video inputs, and optical output, a LAN input, and multiple USB inputs. I question why modern TV manufacturers have completely dropped RCA inputs - they still come in handy.Wifi - The Samsung 6500 comes with built-in wifi.Final Verdict - The Samsung 6500 offers a great picture with plenty of apps you would expect. While the LG LM6700 does have it beat on ease of use (it requires a lot less tweaking), but ultimately it can not offer the ultra-bright picture of the Samsung 6500. Is the Samsung 6500 the greatest LED TV on the market... nope, but it may be the best one at this price point!4 1/2 Stars", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ultimate Configuration, Awesome 3D with Too many Software Issues", "Author": "Phanindra", "ReviewID": "R2L2EGB22MW5DT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let me start with PROSUltimate configuration with awesome 3D experience, super clarity and sound quality.

I have to power it off and when I power it on with wifi and/or wired connection I see multiple issues as below2) After the above step if i power on my TV it starts with a Green horizontal line on the top edge of the TV3) When ever this happens it loses all my Network settings and it doesn't connect the Smart HUB (Netflix/YouTube). It doesn't even detect my WIFI or a wired LAN connection.4) Whenever YouTube gets stuck/freezes TV doesn't respond to remote control and on restarting the TV wired or wifi connection gets disconnected and doesn't detect wifi or wired LAN connection.5) At times when I watch YouTube TV restarts all of a sudden.6) When ever I restart YouTube if I forward the earlier video I was watching the amount of forwarding/image doesn't match with the time it is buffered for. Ex: Fast forwarding the video for 30 mins approximately shows 1 hour 30 mins on the seek bar of YouTube.7) Netflix doesn't connect thru wifi initially so I have to connect through LAN cable8) 3d doesn't work with NetflixTV Model No: UN46ES6500FXZAVersion No: TS01Serial No: Z4XXXXXXXXX179MBelow are the Transaction numbers for the calls made to Samsung support to resolve. But nothing helps.1) Samsung Transaction No: 2xxxxxxx40 -- Was to reset to factory settings only to see the issues again.2) Samsung Transaction No: 2xxxxxxx603) Samsung Remote Diagnosis Chat Session ID: LTK56xxxxxxxx4X4) Samsung Transaction No: 2xxxxxxx07- Level-1/Tier-1 couldn't help this time. They escalated to Level-2/Tier2 Support & i was put on brief hold every time and I was finally heard from Samsung that the crash & restart are firmware issues are being fixed in an firmware update across E models which is being fixed. Do you want to wait for a fix and live with the issues till you get a firmware update? I wouldn't do that when I am spending so much on a TV.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Two star", "Author": "S. kalman \"mclare\"", "ReviewID": "RZIBITEDEDO53", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I decided to actually do a review of the smart TV features since that's what it's sold as, rather than just give it 5 stars and act like \"its so cool and good picture, I love my newt TV!!\"  I mean if you wanted good picture and nothing more you can get that for $500.  So here goes...My goal was use this TV's features to get all my content from the internet so I could cut the cable and save $900 a year, that's enough to buy a new TV every year.  I was going to use the web browser to visit various TV websites like NBC, PBS, etc. like I do on my computer and view shows that way, instead of cable. I was going to use netflix for other shows and movies, plus the on-demand apps for any movies/shows not on netflix... (and antennas work in my area). Total price for internet plus netflix/onlineTV would be $30/month.  This can supposedly be done with PS3 and xbox; but for those of us who don't play games we don't see a point in buying those devices for simple tasks.Assembly:  You know that problem with the screws not fitting in the stand that they've been having for almost a year now? Well it would have been excusable if this were a new item to hit market; but I bought this thing in August and apparently they're still having the problem.  I wasn't going to wait 2 weeks for them to ship new screws so I pushed hard and jammed them in,that seems to work.First turning it on:  The thing asks to Update; say \"YES!!!\".  I didn't at first which meant each time I tried a feature it had to update that individual feature.  The whole process of waiting for updates took about an hour.  I tried going to manual update but the whole screen went blank each time I tried that; I had no idea what was going on.  I decided to just leave it on for 30 min on the blank screen and see if would update; well apparently it did, then I had to turn it off and back on again to receive any acknowledgment from the TV.  All around the whole interface it extremely buggy at first, and gets a little less buggy with the update.  I tried the MSNBC App first, it worked Ok for a while then started having buffering problems then crashed.  Thats what it does. I don't know why these apps are so buggy its not rocket science to make an app. Netflix doesn't seem to have a way to browse by category like it has on the computer and iphone. You have to use the slow letter-by-letter search feature to find movies or just watch what it suggests to you from you're queue or whatever, not a huge problem, but slightly annoying and easily fixable by Netflix and Samsung if they choose. Netflix crashes a few times a day.Web browsing:  The web browser actually works better than other reviewers are giving it credit for.  I'm still pissed at it but Ill explain later.  You need a smart phone, ipad or keyboard for it to be practical.  You must download the remote app to your phone and then you can type into the browser, search and navigate fast using the iphone keyboard. After using it a while I got pretty good at it and learned some of the quick keys on the remote; keep playing with it if you're having problems.  It is a basic browser, it can watch some of the video on bing, I can watch all the videos on yahoo news.  I tried going to Pbs.org and it couldn't read any of the video.  This is a problem for me as I find no excuse for it.  My cheap little phone can watch all the video on pbs and just about any other site, but my TV, can't. What kind of a TV has trouble with video?  That's all it does... is play video, and yet it sucks when compared to a phone or my 5 year old laptop.  The remote app is basically the same as the regular TV remote (other than the browser keyboard).  The app comes with a laptop-like track pad that would be really nice for moving the cursor around the screen if it actually worked.I was looking for ways to visit the websites on my computer, hit full screen and stream to the TV. I had to buy a $100 Diamond USB transmitter that adds the TV as a second monitor; For example if I want to watch last nights TV episodes, I load website video on laptop browser, drag window to TV and hit full screen; It works;  but what sucks is I didn't have to buy a $1,100 TV if I was going to do that, any TV can do that.Sound is great.  This was important to me.  I'm a minimalist and didn't want to buy the whole home theater just to get decent sound, its not like my life revolves around TV.  Most if not all the 2012 TVs suck this year, and sound is one of their weakest points.  CR rated Samsung's sound really good and that factored into my decision.A lot of people who haven't done their research like to know about the picture. So I'll teach you how to shop for picture quality.  In the year 2012 you don't need to worry about picture quality.  The manufacturers have mostly mastered this.  TVs are basically divided into a few classes, low end LCD, high end LCD, and plasma.  So for picture all you have to ask is \"am I willing to settle for low end LCD, like Westinghouse and other cheap brands\", and \"do I like the plasma look or LCD look better?\"  and last do you want glossy screen or matte screen?  So if you're stressing over whether Lg, Panasonic, Sony or Samsung has a better picture you're wasting your time, they are all roughly the same, they are all excellent; in fact many of the displays are made under the same joint patents, in the same factory, on the same assembly line. So if you see a difference in the store models it is probably just the settings that make them look different.I give it 2 stars because I don't see much excuse for its pitfalls. It's pitfalls cause major inconveniences and yet are really easy for Samsung to fix. I don't think I'm asking a lot that my $1100 TV can play all the internet videos that my $150 phone can play.  I mean this TV costs as much as a computer, a fancy computer at that. TVs with apps have been out for years. The apps should work flawlessly at this point, and they should have extremely advanced features.  My parents bought a Samsung a few years ago and it does everything this one does except browse the web.  I also knock a lot of stars off for false marketing.  I hate it when companies lie, saying their product has all kinds of features that really are very buggy or done half-ass, poorly updated.  What do they think I'm going to do with a browser built into my TV?  Read?  No, the only purpose it serves is to watch videos on websites.  So don't say you have an internet browser when it only views everything but video.  If your goal is to just buy it plug it into a cable and BD you'll be fine, it's cheaper than Sony and at the time of writing this Samsung seems to have better Quality control than Lg so buggy smart features aside, it's OK.In my research I had narrowed it down to 2 TVs based on smart features, this one and the Panasonic. These are rated as having the best smart features of all the TVs out there. The Panasonic has slightly better 3d quality, but slightly worse sound quality, a glossy screen which I hate, and the browser was rated a wee bit better in Samsung; the Panasonic is also 100-200 cheaper than this one. I've found in my research I can't have my cake and eat it too, there is no TV 40-46\" that has it all.  You have to pick and choose and sacrifice one feature for another. Supposedly if you're willing to buy bigger TVs the features are all around better, it seems that's where companies are putting their best resources.  For me Samsung had the best sound hands down, and supposedly the best smart features so that's what I got.Update: It's over a year later.  Samsung has updated the software on the TV several times and added bugs each time.  I have to sign into Netflix every time I use it.  Unlike Vizio Samsung doesn't have a full keyboard on the remote and the phone app was never updated to get one. So.. this is very time consuming.  Lots of people having this issue and Samsung refuses to address it. I didn't realize before that in order to use any of the apps, netflix etc..  It has to connect to Samsung's servers; so when Samsung's servers are down, your TV is down.  This is so they can gather info about what you watch.  They've kept their marketing/personal-info-gathering features updated fine, but not any features that would apply to you. After buying many buggy Samsung products this year, none of which were new models, I'm disgusted with Samsung as a company and will try to avoid their products in the future.  They could fix most their issues with simple software updates, but for some reason they don't.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture after simple adjustment", "Author": "S. Edelstein", "ReviewID": "R1OEU0P046CIKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has an excellent picture, period. If your main criteria for a TV is the picture then I don't think you can go wrong with this TV.Now some background...Out of the box, news shows were unwatchable while movies and most other programming were great. Just about every news show was overly bright and faces so much so it was unwatchable as far as I was concerned. But two simple adjustments fixed it.Using the Natural setting I dialed back Brightness from 45 to 35 and Color from 52 to 40. Now there are a zillion other controls and the picture can be tweaked endlessly. But those two probably made 90% of the diference with 10% of the effort. You will want to adjust the settings to your preference but Color and Brightness is definitely the place to start.Pros:- Great picture- Great use of the overall dimension. The overall size is a bit smaller than our previos 40 inch Samsung. But the outer bezel is so narow that the it's mostly screen. So we have a 46 inch TV in a 40 inch space as far as I'm concerned.-Desent sound. The speakers are on the back and reflect against the rear wall giving a pretty full sound. But for full sound we use our external surround system.- Easy setup- Stylish look.Cons:- I would have liked RCA audio outputs. But there are none.- Universal remote operation with DIsh Network is lame.

Motion is smooth, picture is crisp and natural-looking, and I even managed to drastically reduce the bleeding (its still noticeable during scenes where the corners are really really dark, but you have to look for it to notice). I ordered a calibration blu-ray disc which will hopefully help a bit more with the picture fidelity.The apps aren't that useful and can't compete with the offerings of a gaming console (I have my PS3 and Xbox360 hooked up to it). I don't ever see myself using any of the onboard apps. (netflix was pretty solid and standard, but viewing it on the tv means you have to readjust the picture settingsGaming is really great, but once again you have to dive into the settings and fiddle around with them to get the right image.The 3-d viewing of 3d content was really impressive. 3d games on my playstation especially blew me away. 2d to 3d conversion is  much more hit or miss though. There are many moments where the added depth looks realistic (especially while gaming) but most of the time it isn't really that convincing and tends to result in a wicked headache after a while. Another gripe that I have is the positioning of the inputs. Two of the HMDI ports along with the component ports stick out of the back, rather than the side of the unit. It's not a problem for me because I haven't mounted it, but it's worth mentioning as a heads up to those who plan to.All in all though, once you rough it out, massage the settings, and give it some elbow grease, this is simply an awesome television. I'm very happy with my purchase.Now hopefully it doesnt break down (knocks on wood).", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Goofy Stand", "Author": "Carlos Aona \"KabarKing\"", "ReviewID": "R202GNMR1ERAP1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the 46\" 3D HD TV today.

I have two gripes: The literature does not say which Key Boards (Brand / model) work with the TV other than Samsung --that sells for around a hundred bucks. Issue Two: The attachment of the stand to the TV is 100% junk. I mean garbage, tin foil, refuse designed by a madman. To attach it one must lay the TV on its face and attach the stand with four screws. If the four TANGS do not all engage properly, the TV leans so badly it might fall over.

For the silver I was not willing to pay extra. My real need was the 2D to 3D conversion so I could watch all my 2D favorites in 3D. Word of caution here, 2D to 3D is not top of the line but it does do a fairly good job. I have even watched some of my favorite TV shows in 2D-3D mode and enjoy them.3D is awesome, If you saw Avatar 3D in the theater and remember how the Ava's flowers came floating towards you when it came around on Jack Sulley, yes its that good.The next big reason for getting Samsung is cause I have 3D DVD/Blue-ray player by Samsung and it makes it easy to integrate these units when you stay with the same brand. Yes you have to have a 3D Blue-ray or DVD player to watch the 3D movies. The 3D technology is reversible. That is you can convert  3D-2D if you end up having guests and don't have enough 3D glasses.Picture quality is great but the sound is from really small speakers so I have for now an external amp. You should know though that hooking up an external amp without the HDMI cable wont let you control the volume through TV remote. You will have to do that through the amp control or manually. I strongly recommend you use external speakers if you like higher volume or the bass will sound like someone knocking on the wall.If you want a good sound and want to control it with your TV remote then get Samsung Sound bar and some are really a good deal on Amazon. I like mine to be a surround sound system. So when I upgrade to 65 or 80 inch Samsung TV in a couple of years, I will get that system. In these sound systems look for one feature you must have and that is HDMI cable connection. The TV remote will integrate through  it.Another really good thing I like about Samsung is you can chat with their Techs on line 24/7. So when I had issues with the sound I chat-ed with them they walked me through without rushing me and that's when I discovered my amp should have HDMI out in order to have TV control the amp. Word of caution here: The tech at the other end is there to help you so don't take out your frustration on them. Be nice state your problem and answer their question without adding gory details. They are only trying to troubleshoot the issue. At the end if you fill out a two minute survey, they will even email you the Chat conversation.The auto back-light adjust that adjusts automatically to the room illumination is a joke. I left mine on manual.Apart from that I like to view my PowerPoints and home video from my computer on big screen. I am not very savvy on wireless connections so I ordered VGA to HDMI converter to match computer to TV. Besides I really don't want my TV to be connected to the internet. Computer getting viruses is enough for me :). Any ways my next computer will also have HDMI out on it :).See you are now in the digital technology so anything you have analog is not going to fit like a glove. Once you start going digital you will eventually need to upgrade your equipments to digital. Until then you will end up having to make-do.Most other points are covered by other writers so I will leave it at that and update if I find something new.Hope that helps.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tv", "Author": "Adam H Risser", "ReviewID": "R3SXRQ8B3OMWJ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Looks great, but the smart tv features are dog slow and really crappy.

I did not watch any standard TV, network HD TV or BluRay so I cannot comment on that. As this was purchased to play Xbox and watch sports, the issue came with playing Xbox. I found that there was significant lag even when in \"game mode\". It did not matter what cable you used (HDMI vs Component), there was lag. It became very apparent when playing Rock Band.

There are other excellent reviews that are very technical in nature, that I found helpful before ordering this TV.  What I can report is that my husband--who is oddly not that much into technology--LOVES this TV.  He's a sports fan and can't wait to watch his first football game on this set.  We got it hooked up last night to our HD provider, and we couldn't believe the 1080 pixel resolution.  We watched an episode on Yellowstone Nat'l Park on PBS's Nature and could not believe how absolutely stunning the picture was.  We felt like we were right there in the park.  I didn't buy the TV for the 3D, and didn't have high expectations, but I have to say that that too exceeded all expectations and my kids and I love the 3D.  My husband will probably be caught wearing 3D glasses to watch sports from now on.  We just bought 2 more pairs of 3D glasses.The TV arrived in its box in excellent condition, btw, as I was a little concerned about delivery during the holiday season and the TV getting tossed around.  I'm not sure what upgraded delivery means--it came standard UPS--but was fine.  The TV is also so light that my 10 year old and I could pick it up and put it on our entertainment center ourselves.  A pair of glasses was defective--the battery wouldn't go in right--but amazon was quick to replace them.  Thank you, amazon!Not sure how much we'll use the SmartHub features--the internet seemed a little slow on our wireless connection--but it's nice to have and now I can easily order PPV movies.  We are looking forward to discovering more features of this TV.  It's a great choice, as far as I'm concerned.  And the size of 46\" is perfect for our family room, not big--maybe 300 square feet?", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the money!", "Author": "John G. Skinner \"hhibrit\"", "ReviewID": "R3UIDV4XQL7957", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The main reason anyone buys a TV is to watch Satellite/Cable, DVD/Blu Ray or Netflix.Here is the crunch. The quality of the image on screen is really dependent on the quality of the input! If you are using a \"cheap\" dvd/bluray player don't expect stunning picture quality. Most reviewers don't mention anything about peripheral equipment so you really have to take any quality issues with a \"pinch of salt\".I have just demoted my 40\" Sony Backlit LED to the Master Bedroom. My Living room now has the Samsung TV coupled with a Yamaha YRS 700 home theatre system and  an Oppo BDP 93 Blu Ray Player (3D). Picture quality is stunning with 3D, DVD, Satellite and Netflix (that was a surprise!) and way better than the Sony!.I only have one criticism and that is, with 3D it is prone to ghosting. This is because the refresh rate is 120 Hz. With active 3D, your 3d glasses alternate between the 2 3D images so therefore your brain interprets this as a refresh rate of 60 Hz per image. Unfortunately a lot of people are able to detect this so you will see motion blur. Ideally anything over 75 Hz is undetectable, so TV's with a refresh rate of 160 and up look a lot smoother.Now  the big question....Smart TV/Internet surfing. I watch TV/Movies on the TV and use my Macbook Air or iPad for surfing. My Oppo Blu Ray player is fabulous for Netflix/Hulu etc.I have also tried the TV with a Sony BDP S90 ($160.00) and the picture quality was almost as good as the Oppo ($700.00+)The Oppo is way better with internet applications.For the Money this is an incredible TV, and it comes with 2 pairs of 3D glasses (extra glasses are under $18.00 on Amazon).Word of warning!  Blu Ray is not a standardized format. There are many proprietary formats out there. Make sure you do perform regular firmware updates otherwise some disks will not play properly, if they play at all.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am so happy I bought this TV", "Author": "TSForrest", "ReviewID": "R22E5K8GSYJZ6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent more than two weeks researching TV's from most of all the name brands. I kept coming back to Samsung when it came down to the features that were important to me. Here are some of the features that brought me to purchase this TV:- Quality picture - This is a show stopper. Any TV must have a great Full HD picture, true color representation, a suitable refresh rate of 120Hz or better- Good 3D - Important, but not as important as 2D picture quality. Let's face it... 3D is cool, but the vast majority of what I will watch will be 2D. However, when some really good 3D movie is available, I want to be able to have a top-notch 3D experience.- Smart TV features with built-in WiFi (Wireless-N required). I have an Xbox 360, which I use for Netflix, Xfinity TV, and other access to streaming media. In the near future, I may move my Xbox to another location, and I don't want to lose that functionality. Plus, I really like the ability to do other things, such as updating the firmware over the Internet. I also like the ability to do quick Internet surfing. Since buying this TV, I bought a small bluetooth keyboard/touch pad combo (several for under $25), which gives me a much nicer way to surf the Internet, which I cannot do from my Xbox (at this time, might come to Xbox later). I also have a Samsung blu-ray player, which integrates nicely with this TV. It does a lot of little things behind the scenes to make using the blu-ray player easier and nicer than on other TV's.Overall, I am very pleased with this TV. The only thing I ever wonder if I should have done differently was to go with a bigger screen size, but that is all I wonder about my decision to buy this TV.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - Internet browser is useless, no Amazon video access", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "RVIFGJXMBIP35", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This review is about the Samsung 46\" E series 6500, or \"Smart TV\".  I would rename it \"dumb TV\".  DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO USE THE INTERNET OR AMAZON VIDEOS. BAIT AND SWITCH!!!! Yes the video quality and sound quality and physical features are beautiful. It's a wonderful technologically advanced product for cable TV.  BUT.  We bought this solely because it was advertised as \"easy web browsing\" with \"full web browser\" and we wanted to specifically use it to watch Amazon Instant Video. My husband looked at multiple reviews and found a website which listed the product as offering Amazon Instant Video.  When it arrived, we found out that (1) The Amazon App is removed, actually gone since the fall of 2011, from all 2012 Smart TV models.  (2) You cannot access Amazon videos on the web browser because the Web browser (called \"Smarthub\") is horrible and crashes constantly.  Even Youtube hardly worked.  (3) YOu cannot navigate the web browser with the remote because the buttons on the remote simply don't function well enough (i.e. trying to sign into Amazon took over 30 minutes). (4) A Samsung wireless keyboard was available only briefly this spring but is now \"off the market\" and unavailable in the U.S.  ALL of these problems are widely reported on CNET and other tech websites but not mentioned on the Amazon reviews at all.  Someone developed an Iphone app to try to solve problem 3 and 4 in the fall of 2011 but it is now \"defective\" and will not work, even though you can download it.  This is a nightmare.  Why would we want a 1200 dollar internet TV that cannot get the internet and cannot get the one feature we bought it for.  What's very apparent is that they want to force you to use their proprietary \"apps\" which include Netflix and others, and \"family programs\" that reuquire you to pay and \"register\" (i.e. provide personal information).  But the one feature that they advertise as working great \"the full browser\" is absolutely useless.

Cocuzzo", "ReviewID": "RXRV8OUR5NNY1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this because CR rated it well, sound was supposed to be better than average for flatscreen TV.The viewing angle is not as wide as some of the more expensive LCD's or any plasma, but plasmas start at 50\" and we did not have space for that wide a TV.  We find that the viewing angle is fine for our situation and would only be an issue if you need to view from well off-center position.TV sets up easily, we have it connected directly to cable thru which it can tune some HD stations and to our Tivo HD via an HDMI cable.  We got a free Samsung Blue Ray player which is on another HDMI connection and we have a Wii downstream from a mechanical video switch (so that we can toggle to a VCR/DVD player also as needed).As you'd expect, the Blue Ray Player and TV remotes play well together, being from the same Manufacturer, but I was also pleased that the Tivo remote could be programmed to control TV volume and input source and that the TV remote could be programmed to control the Tivo when switched to \"STB\".  The TV is also smart about figuring out whether a device is on and feeding signal.  At first I had the TV on our wireless \"G\" network, but I switched it to a wired ethernet connection and I found that Netflix performance was much better on the wire.  Both methods could stream movies well, but the wired connection makes \"fast forward\" more like a DVD or Tivo.  On the wireless, you have to pick a scene and then wait for buffering, on wired you hardly wait for buffering.A minor plus with the Samsung is the \"Verizon FiOS\" application that allows you to view some premium stations via the network feed and do Pay-Per-View without a set top box.  Since we returned our big set top box and use the Tivo Cable Card to tune Fios, there is a remote possibility that when the two Cable Card tuners are busy, a desired third channel would be availble thru this option.  The most typical situtation, however, is that the Tivo is busy recording and a Red Sox game is on and the Samsung does not get that station thru its Verison Fios software.  If it tuned all the subscribed FioS stations it would be a great feature.We are reasonable content with the sound from this TV, but have decided to splurge on a 5.1 \"home theater in a box\" system from Yamaha (597).  This has not yet arrived from Amazon.PS - the 3D feature on the TV works well, but for us it is just a novelty so far.  We watched a few of the demos, but have no Blu-Ray 3D movies.  The active glasses synch easily, but they are a bit flimsy/small and open so a bit difficult to perch in front of glasses for watching.  It works okay, but the temple pieces are so lightweight that the glasses tend to skew and you end up fussing with them to keep them in front of eyeglasses.

Doesn't make sense to me at all.Besides those, pretty good picture, sound and web connectivity.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Never going to Order through Amazon again", "Author": "Suman Padullaparti", "ReviewID": "RYJF6ADYAKFDT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I took Amazon Prime membership and ordered this item expecting this to be delivered before Christmas. I has a nightmare because of Amazon and UPS. UPS tried to deliver this on Thursday and I was not available. Driver left a note on my door saying that he will deliver it on Friday. I took a paid time off to receive the package and driver never showed up. Then I scheduled pickup from UPS warehouse and waited at UPS warehouse for 3 hours on Christmas eve. Finally they told me they lost my package. Really, they lost a 46 Inch TV???I immediately cancelled the order.Amazon called me and said they don't want to lose my business so I ordered the same TV again and this time I got the TV in time but it is not working. Half of the screen turned white and was showing no image. Now I am here spending 1000$ and all my time on Christmas eve and New Years Eve without TV.Returning the broken TV is a hassle because there is no option to dropoff and I had to again wait for the UPS guys to come and pick it up.My friends ordered the same TV from other sites and they are happy. After been so log with Amazon, I expect more effort from them in customer satisfaction.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Junk!!!", "Author": "biged", "ReviewID": "RPAVLJQKC89Q0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just got around to reviewing this TV as I was waiting to see if would hold up. Well, it didn't! Had it 3 years and it crapped out. Called Samsung and they were sorry to hear about it and that my unit did not qualify for a issue that they are having with capacitors failing on certain units. Ordered a 120Hz unit and received a 60Hz. I personally believe a TV should last longer than 3 years!!! If plan on buying one, expect problems and purchase an extended warranty plan to cover the expense for repair.
