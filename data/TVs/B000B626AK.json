I call Polaroid Corp CS and it takes me to Canada TWW Warranty for Polaroid, WOW! So, they told me that the HDTV that I bought would have to have like 5-6 pixels burnt out in a 1\" inch square before they would issue a return or exchange! I am so totally surprised that Polaroid as big named as it is would let this kinda trash help them keep customers happy! I finally after googling for about 30 mins came up on the American CS for Polaroid, you have to talk to the 1 for films or you will not get an American CS and all others will not let you return or exchange it! I will not EVER buy another Polaroid PRODUCT of any kind after this, it still hasnt been fixed and I have called them 6 or more times and each time they tell me that they will call me back within 24 hours and NEVER HAVE HEARD anything. I guess they are waiting on the warrenty to run out on it. Never again!

It's in my home office, so I barely use it. Picture quality was not that good, even when playing HD channels through a Motorola hi-def box. In fact, I ended up taking the hi-def box out and just connecting the coax to the monitor, because the picture wasn't that good - especially compared to a similiar Samsung monitor I have in my kitchen. Anyway, just fired it up, and I am experiencing similiar problems as some of the other posts - vertical lines appearing on the picture, the entire picture starts to shift down the screen, and for the few secons the picture locks in, it's purple. I thought it might be the cable signal, but it's the same signal that is powering my Samsung DLP, which is not having any problems. Unfortunately, it has the same problem when I tried to play a DVD to it, so I think it is toast.

We put this in our bedroom so it has not been used much - maybe 12 hours in the past year.  The other day when we turnedit on the picture was there for about 2 seconds then slid down the screen untill it was gone and all you could see was vertical lines - if yo uchange the channell the picture would come back for 2 seconds and do the same thing.  I spent a lot of time holding for CS with polaroid and received nothing!  Unfortunately we were just outside of the 1 year warranty but I thought maybe they woul dmake an exception since it was so close and pretty obvious that it was a xmas present because of the time of year but NO Luck!  We are now going to take it to a local repair store and pay $45 to see if it can be fixed reasonbly.  I am very dissappointed.

The price there on it at that time was somewhere around $160, and for that price the set is well worth it. Mine came with no dead pixels on screen.Other people have said that the picture is real bad when using other hookups besides S-video(which is what I now use). I didn't find that to be true. When it was hooked up via composite cables, it had a better picture than my old cathode tube TV did with them. With S-video the picture is about on par with my LCD computer monitor.The only problem I have had with this TV set, is sometimes it doesn't recognize when you have a video cable plugged into it. I have to usually unplug the monitor, and then replug in the video cable to it after starting up. Doesn't have too often, but enough to take it down a star.Good TV overall if you can get for under $170.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "Robert R.
