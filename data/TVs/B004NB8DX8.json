{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Quality, Extremely Functional, and Amazing Stylish HDTV", "Author": "Kyler Christensen", "ReviewID": "R2ISR83CZQKUI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Whoah, I really did my research on this one (I always do when I make huge investments into things that I plan on owning for a long time) and I am not disappointed!!! For those that don't know, LED TVs are arguably considered the best class of HDTVs (including LCD and plasma along with all of their variants) and this particular model I feel is really the best in its class (considering all things: quality of picture, pricing, features, and, in my humble opinion, size - I really didn't need anything larger than about 40-something inches for my purposes).I'm going to go on a small side note: Some will argue that plasma has the best picture. However, LEDs have better picture at identical resolutions. I checked this model out on the floor at Best Buy along with two other (42\") TVs that I was comparing, an LG LCD and a Panasonic plasma. The sales associate swore by plasma and couldn't even tell the obvious difference in contrast between the 42\" and this model (the LED one was obviously better). I'm not going to patronize you on the pros and cons of each class of TV (although I could) but, all things considered, LED really is the best overall. Do your homework if you haven't.Anyways, I noticed that some people whined about: 1) the sound, 2) the remote, 3) screen glare, 4) light leakage, or 5) whatever dud/lemon of a TV they got. I'm going to address these points with rebuttals in the following bullet points:-1) In truth the sound is very decent (you're buying a stand-alone HDTV, what did you expect?) and most people may want to purchase a sound bar/system down the road. Plus there are multiple sound options that enhance and isolate individual parts of the sound that matter to you (\"Clear Voice\" is a good one sometimes).-2) Hey, it's a REMOTE! Come on, people! Seriously though, the remote is intuitive enough and has some cool features (the menus are very simple and a joy to navigate once you get the hang of everything), like button back-lighting that you can toggle on and off with one glow-in-the-dark button. Plus the buttons have a good feel and good travel to them.-3) Unless you keep the windows open and they're facing the TV, this is not really a huge issue at all - especially when the TV is actually ON!-4) Here's where I think that I will acknowledge some peoples' pouting and concern; on the upper and lower right and left corner portions of the screen, and even upper-center (where the light is sourced from), I did notice some faint circular light leakage/blooming spots when watching a movie at night. It is minor but they are there. However, this is only noticed when the following conditions are met: you're watching in a super widescreen letterbox-format picture, it's night-time or the house lights are off, and the movie scene is a really dark one. I'm not certain if this is normal of LEDs or not. Either way, it is very minor, can easily be ignored, and is definitely not worth taking my TV back for. I'm already too happy with it as you might guess.-5) Mine arrived in perfect condition. I recommend a free trial of Amazon Prime. You can get this TV with free standard shipping rates or $4 for overnight shipping in the continental US.-One last initial worry of mine that I wanted to insert into this review is concerning the bezel/frame style. the outer edge is surrounded with an additional clear edge that contains an even smaller and extremely subtle clear red edge. Aesthetics are an important thing for me so looking at this model in the store was a MUST. However, the red edge along with the clear edge was virtually unnoticeable in the store. When you do look closely and see it you will notice how stylish it all really is. The frame is ultra thin, black gloss, and sits on a mostly-glass base. the shaft of the base mount is clear glass so the TV kind of seems like it's floating. I think that that was what the designers were going for.Now on to some of the features that previous reviewers didn't touch on... This TV has really got you covered. There are a multitude of sound and video options in a very intuitive menu interface. I haven't utilized any of the Internet-accessing options yet. My main plan was to hook my laptop up to the HDMI port and do a lot with that. But here is where the TV really shines for me: the HDD USB port. If you have a USB flash drive/external hard drive then you can view photos, play music, and even watch movies straight off of it. Playing movies has no slow-down whatsoever. If you somehow acquire Blu-ray disc movie rips or whatever video file type/extension you have, chances are great that it will play them all with no problem. The TV has played almost every movie file type that I've thrown at it. I love the streamlined menu within the videos. You can't ask for anything better in this aspect. And HD videos all look glorious.Lastly, some people complain about the \"soap opera\" effect that HDTVs can suffer from. I believe other brands sometimes call this feature \"Trumotion\", but for this line of TVs Samsung refers to it as \"Auto Motion Plus\". Thankfully, you have the option to turn this feature off if you'd like or change it to one of five other settings.Well, I'm not sure what else to say.. I didn't need or want a 3D TV yet... But everyone that has come over to our place sees the screen resolution and picture quality and is always immediately impressed. I highly recommend this TV to anyone. At 40 inches, do yourself a favor and get it for the picture quality and unbeatable price for an LED class TV.EDIT: The one other draw for LED HDTVs is the extremely small off-chance for \"burn in\" if you view the same picture constantly without a change in picture. The manual warns something along the lines of being sure not to view the exact same picture for more than 5% of your total viewing time in any given week. Otherwise, it's a small chance (but possible) that you could get burn in on your TV.(Update as of 6/27/11): The picture quality has always been utterly exceptional and without comparison for this TV. However, I have a very keen eye and will still at times notice the light leaking issue during EXTRA widescreen videos where the light is on the top and bottom borders and is darkest. I think that I am going to continue hanging on to this TV, however, notwithstanding this one issue - although I am currently weighing the matter as it compares to the price and timing for this investment for me now. If I do contact Samsung, I would only want this same model again. Videophiles may just want to keep this light leakage issue in mind for their purchase.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Auto Motion Plus - the price disparity", "Author": "K. Singhasiri", "ReviewID": "RJRU8DOMG35GL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After owning this TV for exactly a month I've finally decided to write a review, you know, after the excitement wears off and what not. Actually I'm still pretty excited about it. My previous set was also a Samsung 26\" LCD and upgrading to this one was worthwhile.Since this is a television, I'll comment about the picture first. Out of the box it's very good, after adjusting the settings a bit - excellent. The colors are very vibrant and no problems with viewing angles. I actually like my images to have a bit of contrast to them; I prefer black to be black and not grey. At first I was having a hard time trying to get it right, since my initial reaction was to reduce backlight and gamma, but crank up contrast and brightness. After a while, I finally figured out 'brightness' had  the biggest effect. Around 30% was where it really kicks in, but it didn't occur to me to drop it that low. It's all about preference though, and this TV should have enough settings for anybody. Aside from contrast though, I don't see an insane amount of difference between this and a non-LED set... Something I must mention about the settings though, depending on which of the 4 picture presets you're on, certain selections like advanced video settings become unselectable for reasons unknown. Though I pretty much left that setting untouched. Despite that, I really like the fact that settings are saved independently across the 4 presets for EACH input source. So, for example, if you have 4 connections coming in, you can have a total of 16 presets - good stuff. I also tried the PC input through vga and found the picture to be very sharp. Colors are accurate though a bit strong and text is easily readable from a few feet out and this is coming from a practically blind gamer. The audio, I found to be pretty good. The bass isn't going to blow your neighbors away, and it's not going to replace any home theater system, but there is a very capable, customizable equalizer on board which should help a bit. Loudness for this set wasn't a problem for me.Now I must talk about the 120Hz Auto Motion Plus(AMP) dealy as it seems to be the main feature that drives up the cost from lower models. What AMP does for you is, well, readable in the product description, so I'll describe it. AMP made every thing move faster while maintaining picture detail. (more frames in the same amount of time = faster) So, to me, everything looked like either home movies or daytime soaps which, if you can picture them, tend to move faster than most television programs and movies. Despite the bit about daytime soaps, I generally watch movies and sports, and after a few dozen years of watching them in ~24 frames per second (a bit higher for sports), I found the added (double?) frames to seem unnatural. After a few days found myself turning the feature off completely even for sports. Though there's nothing wrong with the quality of the image presented per se, I'd just prefer to see a blue flash go by as opposed to Ironman's actual chest piece go by, for example. And it only really kicks in at what seems like certain intervals, so the inconsistency in framerate got to me as well. I did find a use for AMP while gaming. Everything moves at what seems like 60 fps even when the game is not natively known to. Though, again, it's not 100 percent consistent in high frames (more like 60-80) and certain, very fast moving, games, like racing, cause what seems like screen tearing at the edges. You probably won't notice it (AMP) on games that already run at 60fps, and also it won't work miracles for games with already poor and inconsistent framerates. Overall, it looks fantastic for games, as I didn't give it a second thought about leaving it on, but for everything else I finally decided not to.The main selling point for me was the Connectshare. I was thinking of purchasing a digital media player a while back, but here it's already built-in and it's a very capable one indeed. Though, there's too many to list here, the TV's e-manual actually lists suppurt for a dozen file types spanning several dozen video and audio codecs with bitrates as high as 30 Mbps for certain file types. It's played pretty much every thing I've thrown at it and handled any 'usb device' I've used so far, which includes NTFS formatted sata hard drives with external enclosure, no worries. Though once in a while the audio cuts in and out on my .vob straight rips, and I've yet to test files with very high bitrates since I feel the tradeoff for file size isn't worth it past 7-8 Mbps. Something I must mention about the media player is it does an admirable job of reducing video artifacting from down-conversion, however you're not able to zoom past the actual video while maintaining aspect ratio. In other words it won't crop the black horizontal bars for you on a 4:3 ratio video. You have to do it in the conversion. I found it strange since the option to zoom in is there for all the other video inputs.As for the Smart TV/Samsung App hub, I tried it briefly using the Youtube app under a wired connection(which stalled on the initial install). Videos streamed very quickly and it looked like the the app always plays the highest video quality. Most of the other apps never appealed to me so I found myself quickly deleting them off the TV but this was never a selling point for me anyways, just something to mess around with. As others have mentioned, navigating without a keyboard quickly became a chore. So, hopefully, somewhere along the line, Samsung will separately sell their qwerty remote that's included with their 7000 and up series of TVs otherwise this feature could fade fast.After all that though, I would definitely purchase this TV again if I had to (which I did - the 40\" UN40D6000 series) especially at the $700 price-tag offered at the time (thanks to the wacky commodities exchange-like fluctuating price system here). Even though the LED aspect seems to do more for your eco concerns than picture quality and I seldom use the 120Hz Auto motion, I'd rather have more functionality than less. Also, I can afford it. However, for the casual viewer,  those on a budget, or old-school movie-goer, 120Hz is overkill. I could go with the UN32D5500 32-Inch and still be happy.

The picture quality is super. It is almost too bright. I have adjusted the brightness and toned it down a bit. Colors are great also. Surprisingly, for a TV that is only 1.2 inches thick the sound quality is good. Might also be the positioning of mine, it is above the mantle so the speakers are projecting downward and bouncing off of it. Only thing I find a bit strange is the location of the input jacks. They are on the back right hand side of this set which is the opposite of how I had my wall plates set up. I have two setting suggestions. Turn off the Eco Sensor which adjusts the picture brightness to the ambient light in the room. For me it was dimming too much. For sports, leave the Auto Motion Plus on but for everything else turn it off. It gives a sort of 3D look to everything and is quite strange when watching movies. Other than that, you will be extremely happy with this set.

Especially since this is a new 2011 model and I am sure people are curious. This TV was replacing a 5 year old Philips Plasma. Picked up this TV a few weeks ago from Best Buy. Great picture. Good color and decent blacks for an edge lit LED. Great design also. The apps were cool, but my Blu-Ray player already has the same apps so that didn't interest me. I also have no interest in 3D, but most of the 2011 models all have it so it is what it is. The picture was crisp and as usual very bright with an edge lit LED and very easy to view in the daytime or in a brightly lit room. However, once the lights go out it's a different story. Let me preface the next few sentences by saying that I did my homework and knew that this could be a potential issue. I just wasn't expecting it to be this extreme. The lights emitted from all four corners and extended about 4 to 5 inches towards the middle of the screen. It was worse on the bottom than the top, but extremely noticeable in all corners. Watching a Blu-Ray with any type of black bars was almost impossible. It was also noticeable in any type of dark scene. Harry Potter and Sherlock Holmes were unwatchable. No matter how hard I tried, my eyes were drawn to the white torches in the corners. I tried adjusting the backlight down to zero which helped but it didn't get rid of it and created a very dark picture. Oh, and before someone tries to scold me for not knowing how to properly calibrate a TV, I didn't have it on the factory setting of Vivid or any other overly bright or unrealistic setting. Not to get off topic but I find it ridiculous that these places expect people to pay more money to have their $2000 plus TV professionally calibrated. For that kind of money, the service should come with it, but I guess that would be in a perfect world. Anyway, I was keeping the back light down along with the brightness because I didn't want an overly bright/washed out look. The backlight goes up to 20 and I had it at 10 before dropping it to zero. On a side note my wife didn't notice it at all until I pointed it out to her so maybe some people won't notice or they may not even care. If I am spending almost $2000 on a TV, I expect it to not have flaws like that. The viewing angle was pretty bad also, but I expected that from an edge lit LED so I don't count that against them. 5 inches of flash-lighting coming from the corners, that's a big strike. Called Samsung and they said to wait 3 or 4 weeks and the problem should \"correct itself\". Sure. Wait another few weeks until my return period runs out and I am stuck with it. I wasn't taking the chance on it going away because I've never heard of that going away and who knows if they would have even attempted to fix it. I am not trashing Samsung's customer service because I didn't have a chance to really work with them, but it seems to me that telling someone to wait 3 or 4 weeks to see if an issue goes away is not the best advice. I have read other reviews about this TV and other edge lit LED's so I know it can be a crap shoot. Some people get what I got, while others get a perfect panel and some other people get even worse ones. I didn't want to get into the hassle of returning sets until I got a good one so I will go with my original gut feeling and that was to get a Plasma. They both have their advantages, but as a current Plasma owner, I believe it is the superior technology. Just an opinion though. I just wanted to get this information about my experience with this TV out there since so many other people have been kind enough to put their reviews out there for me so I could make an educated decision over the last few years.

It's my 4th Samsung flat screen.  I upgraded from a Samsung LN46A550 to the 46\" version of this TV but had to return it because the picture was flickering really bad in 1080i, and to be quite honest the ultra thin frame around the screen makes the TV look smaller than my old TV.  So I decided to upgrade to the 55\".The picture quality pretty breath taking! I already notice a huge difference from going to 60hz refresh rate to 120hz.  When I watch Avitar it almost looks 3D (even though it's not the 3D version).  I haven't quite had time to fully calibrate the settins so the colors are still a little washed out but the clarity is excellent especially for a 55\".  I'll have to admit the the 46\" version of this tv's picture did look better but it was also 9\" smaller with the same resolution.The sound is a lot better than I expected.  Usually the sound on flat screen tv's are pretty poor but I'm actually pretty impressed, very clear and deep.I have noticed some \"flashlight\" effect on the corners of the TV screen.  And I've heard that this bothers a lot of people and can be a problem.  I only notice it on very dark scenes or when there are bars on the top and bottom and it's not too obvious.  I've heard that if you loosen the screws around the bezel in the back that it will help this problem. But it doesn't bother me too much yet.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase especially for the price.  It has to be one of the best 55\" LED tvs for under $1600.

Way Better than Expected!", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R2AI7GN0V0PTSS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been researching for TVs for about 2 years or so and I was deciding to buy a Plasma or LCD, after such consideration since my main purpose for the tv was for my pc and also to upgrade from a 23'' Samsung monitor i've had for about a year. I was really leaning in for a LCD since I was warned about Plasmas \"Image Burn\" since I am using it for a computer monitor, the desktop screen would be displayed quite frequently and it would have been risky. I saw a similar LCD model for around $800 bucks but just when i was about to check out, amazon recommended this TV instead and I took the plunge and never looked back.First of all, for the people who are interested in LED TVs, they are almost the same as LCDs except for a brighter picture and clear quality and about the backlight thing, not really a big difference. I lowered the setting from 2-10 depending the light in my room. The motion picture plus and the 120hz really make internet streaming videos, such as Youtube, Netflix, and Hulu, almost all HD quality (If available, ofcourse). Some of the videos look better from other sources such as my PC and some look better on the Smart TV feature. (For example, netflix is better off my xbox but Hulu Plus looks awesome straight from the Smart Tv App)Second, the Smart TV feature is a plus in so many ways! I also have to mention, I do not have a cable subscription (for good reason, too! $$$) with Hulu and Netflix apps at your finger tips, you will never have to pay more for cable or movie rentals again. I already had a Netflix account so I knew this TV was worth it but the other Apps they offer are useless, dont get me started on the Youtube app, the navigation is so dreadful.Third, I really like the easy access input plugs for your hdmi and other plugs. Also, by clicking the Info button on your remote, you can see how much power your tv is using. I was worried at first for having a big screen tv and sucking in so much power but sure enough my electric bill hasnt gone up and my tv never overheats after using it on a 6 -10 hour basis.The cons?The only main problem with this LED TV is the darn SETTINGS!Samsung's default settings are the worst and it for about a week or 2, I had to tweak the settings almost every time i was watching a youtube or hulu video (Actual Website, not the Smart TV apps). I do recommend looking up settings for the TV to save you time. I suggest looking for last years models and finding those settings since they are almost the same. Now that the settings are right, I havent touch menu button eversince.I do have to say that, the \"Soap Opera Effect\" is really nice and you can turn it off if you dont like it. I turn it on for movies and off for gamesI was told to wait till I've watched 100 hours worth of viewing time till I really notice the difference when I first turned it on.

Color is great, image is vibrant and clear. Seriously, well-done Samsung.The problem is that the local dimming is over-active. When you view an image that's MOSTLY black but with something small on the screen - let's say the bumps on Adult Swim, or the intro to a movie where it just shows the title on a black screen - the tv detects the dark image and reduces the back-lighting. The problem is that if there is still something relatively small on the screen, the lighting may get too dim and you can't see it. The biggest issue, of course, is that you simply CAN'T TURN IT OFF.I spent literally two days tinkering with every setting, searching for the right mode or combination of settings that would disable the local dimming, but it just isn't there. There is no option to disable the local dimming directly - it's factored in to the general picture settings like \"movie mode\", \"game mode\", etc. You can make adjustments that lessen the local dimming effect (it's called Shadow Detail, I think), but even while reduced the problem is still there: this tv does not properly recognize when the lighting should and should not be reduced.If not for this one flaw this tv would be absolutely perfect. Maybe some wouldn't care or notice, but it drove me seriously bonkers.I returned this TV and got a comparable LG model. The LG allows you to directly adjust the intensity of the local dimming feature and even turn it off completely - independent of all the other picture settings. But I found that it wasn't necessary to turn it off on the LG since it seems to perform much better. Plus, the LG was only $30 more and it has 3D (which this Samsung does not).", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Happy Ending", "Author": "MetsFan388", "ReviewID": "R80O3C6QWKY0M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off let me say that the picture on this TV is amazing and i really love the design. Super slim. I also really like the smart hub feature. The only problem i have with this TV is the clouding and flash-lighting. I don't know if others have experienced this but when watching a dark scene in a movie or any widescreen program you can see white light coming through on two of my corners. It sorta looks like two floodlights are being pointed at the center of the screen. On top of that, when the screen is completely dark i also have some clouding at the upper and lower part of the screen. Now I'm not picky by any means and i tried just living with it, but after a couple of days it started distracting me to a point where i can no longer just sit back and enjoy. I know that you may have some flash-lighting on most leds, but at this price point this is unacceptable. So I'm going to have to return it.UPDATEDecided to give this TV another try after reading on another site that if you update the software through the menue it could help with the clouding and flashlighting. Glad i did because after everything installed i watched a movie in a dark room and i have have zero clouding and very minor flashlighting on the bottom left coner. %100 inprovement over the last set i had. Maybe the update helped or maybe i just got a better set, i don't know. But my suggestion is if you are having the same issues i had to try updating the software.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Marvelous TV - great price - worth the wait.", "Author": "Ned", "ReviewID": "R3D175CNBOIHMI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've crept over the line into the 21st Century with my first-of-a-kind purchase of this television technology. I really shopped around on this purchase, read everything I could find, visited the Big Box store to take a peek at it and its competitors, asked my questions, and spent weeks weighing this and that. As a consequence, my expectation of what this TV would be is such that I'm grinning and suffering no buyer's remorse the day after I unboxed it and set it up in under 15 minutes. There may be \"better\" models out there, but not at this price. I'm not into shock-and-awe when it comes to the video experience. My wife and I didn't require a room-wide screen spanning floor to ceiling blasting in-theater sound to thoroughly enjoy our first evening with high definition, LED TV in our household. This TV at this price and with these specs ought to do it for any rational human being.February 2012 - It's been nearly a year. I remain in awe of this television's picture quality and out-of-the-box audio.

I am planning to get a separate sound system- Why in the world would Samsung not include 4 little screws that are required to wall mount the TV (especially with such wall mountable tv!).

Compared to the other TVs at the store, the Samsung's just stand out. And that's precisely why I got this TV. The sound quality is also pretty good on this set, even though I only tested it for a short period of time before connecting my surround sound system. The apps are great, but they could have included a keyboard. Searching for videos on the YouTube app takes forever because of the lousy remote and on-screen keyboard.The biggest issue with this TV is the bleeding that comes from the corners. It's not very noticeable until you turn off the lights and start watching a film that has black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. From each edge, light bleeds towards the middle of the screen. The light is roughly 3 inches in length from each corner. You might not notice this if you never watched movies. But let's be honest here: who buys a 55\" TV and doesn't want to watch a movie? Watching football games or regular 16:9 television programming comes in crystal clear. But once you try to watch something that isn't in a 16:9 format, prepare to have large strips of light bleeding in from the edges.I've spent hours changing the settings thinking that it was something that I could fix. But it's not. I'm very tech-savvy and this issue is not something that can be fixed with a few adjustments in the settings. I tried to convince myself over the past two weeks that I could live with it... but for $1500+, I've decided that I can't. I expected more from Samsung.

For the price this one cannot be passed up. I stood back and looked at what I wanted from a TV and this one fit the bill perfectly. I didn't need 3D or web browsing so I passed on the other models. I researched the whole flashlighting issue thoroughly before making the purchase, and yes, there is a little bit of flashlighting present, but it's barely noticeable on a fully black screen.....I'd never have let this minor issue sway me in my decision, just look around the web for proper settings and the flashlighting issue will be minimal. The sound is also very good for the design of this TV (super thin, rear-facing speakers) I was quite shocked. The picture quality as mentioned by many previous reviewers is absolutely stunning; Samsung LEDs are certainly market leaders in that accord, I was blown away by the clarity of the picture. I mainly bought this TV for gaming, and it gets the job done....It's almost hard to play the game simply because they're so much clearer now, I'm too busy taking in scenery to be bothered with all of the bullets whizzing by. Crystal clear and liquid movement...looks incredible.To sum up the review I'd like to mention that I'm no A/V connoisseur, and for your average person I am thoroughly impressed with this TV. I find it rather easy to overlook the edge light bleeding simply because it's BARELY noticeable.

Because it's no longer in production, the price was dropped to $1,099 and I jumped on it -- great deal, right? My friend has the UN46D6000 and I liked it, so why not invest.So here we go. Colors themselves are very nice. Vibrant and life-like, this is not a complaint whatsoever. The sound is just alright; enabling surround sound on the TV really gives it a nice and needed boost. Of course getting a soundbar or real surround sound will enhance your experience by a bunch. Internet apps, they're fine. A bit slow but I personally won't be using too many of them.The problem really lays here: Edge-lit LED's. I've read about it and understand it's a cost-saving technology, therefore problems are to be expected. The real problem is that for their retail price ($1800+), the backlight bleed is excessive even at low brightness, and the actual backlight is uneven everywhere. There are spots all over the place. After scouring forums on \"fixes\", I've tried using a microfiber cloth to \"tap\" or \"rub\" out some of the spots; for the most part, no luck. Others also report banding and a \"flashlight effect\" which personally doesn't bother me.Also, it appears that on the lower right side, the bezel is not flush with the panel, thus allowing me to actually see the LEDs shine through.For a technology that is clearly not perfected, I don't feel that Samsung should be releasing these displays. It screams \"cheap product.\" I'm sure there will be many others who disagree with me here, but I'm certainly not alone. Just Google the model number and you'll get similar results.After speaking with a Samsung tech via online chat, they offer a free tech repair service. If they're unable to fix it, they'll replace it with a new same or comparable model. I just hate the idea of a 1-day old TV already being taken apart. Nothing ever works the same once this is done.Overall the TV is actually great if you plan on watching mostly light-screen programming. I'm curious to hear if anyone else here has the same issue as me.

looking TV, the style is pretty slick. Light weight and easy to move.Unfortunately for me, that's where the positive ended.I plug in my Xbox to the TV, since I don't have cable, and immediately, in the middle of the screen in the white dialog box I notice this faint gray, thin oval. I, at first tried to ignore it, thinking my eyes were just seeing things, and continued to start my game. But unfortunately, the gray oval was obvious through the game start up and everything.I came on here to set up an exchange, which Amazon handled quickly and easily, so I appreciate that, and publicly thank them. Got the new TV today, unboxed it, and this time took just a digital photo of blank white so I could check to make sure this was a good TV and this screen didn't have the same problem. Connected my usb to the TV, brought up the picture, zoomed in so the white was the screen... and low and behold, not only was the gray, thin oval there smack dab in the middle, there was also a gray line in the middle towards the top of the screen that ran parallel to the edge along with a couple other spots.I wish that it was something I could ignore because the TV overall is nice, but unfortunately for the price, I can't. Anytime there would be a light/white scene I'd have that faint, gray line or oval staring at me which would drive me nuts.I don't know if Amazon just got a bad shipment or storage of the TVs went wrong at the warehouse, I'm not sure.

I ordered this TV on Sunday April 10th from Amazon and it was delivered to my house on Thursday April 14th. The TV was shipped via CEVA Logistics and the box looked flawless upon arrival. The TV was very well packaged and I was surprised that it was only a little over an inch wide.The TV was very easy to mount on my wall with a universal wall mount. All cables were easy to plug in and labeled very well. I highly recommend purchasing the Samsung LinkStick Wireless LAN Adapter Samsung WIS09ABGN LinkStick Wireless LAN Adapter. It was very easy to install and the TV walks you through the setup. The product description says it is for 2010 models, however, the TV's manual says to use this model. It is worth the extra money to have the TV hooked up to the internet-Which brings me to my next point: The Samsung Apps are amazing! You can easily browse Samsung's growing App store from entertainment, weather, social networking, games, etc. I was amazed at the amount of apps they already have. Many of them are free and the paid ones are not too expensive. I am a pretty tech-savy person, but, this TV is very simple to use. My wife has had no problems navigating the apps and switching to different inputs.Bottom line: This TV is simply amazing and worth the money.

Samsung is the hands down winner.  The picture approaches 3D in quality.  There are no bright spots at the corners that other people complained about.  It was extremely light and very simple to put on the wall.  The on screen tutorial made it ridiculously simple to set up.  I am just now going to set up the smart tv function, allowing me to tap into internet entertainment.  I had a little trouble setting up my online passwords, but that's my problem, not Samsungs.  My buddy has the same tv and the smart TV function is awesome.I absolutely love it.  I am kicking myself for not buying a Samsung originally when I purchased the Aquos.The only reason I haven't given it five stars is I've detected a slight blurring effect when images move quickly on the screen.  However, I haven't fully gone through the customization.  I just added a new Yamaha receiver and will reconfigure everything.  I am pretty sure it's a setting on my part and not a shortcoming of the TV.

About half way through the picture went bad, top 2/3rd of the screen is ghosting. I called Samsung, they confirmed its defective out of the box, but won't take it back. They said they can send someone out to repair it - a brand new out of the box defective TV, and it will now be a repaired TV.  Or they said I can return it to Amazon. Yeah thats convenient.  I think based on my experience and some of the other reviews, that they have a quality control problem. Its too much of a hassle to deal with defective product this large, when you buy it from Amazon. I would look at other TVs, stay away from this one, its not worth it.PART 2 -I returned the TV to Amazon, which was handled extremely quickly and efficiently, no questions asked, thank you Amazon.  I got the replacement TV yesterday, it is damaged. The bezel around the screen is broken, cracked at one corner and broken away from the TV all along the top edge. Also the TV black plastic itself at that corner is deformed, I think it came from the factory that way, and thats why the bezel is damaged. I called Samsung, even got escalated, but they will not do anything, they said I need to return it to the retailer.  I'm pretty frustrated at this point, since it is costing me $70 each time to ship one of these things back, I've now spent $140 on shipping for two bad TVs.  The price is no longer right on this TV. I reiterate that Samsung's quality control is bad, and while they are very nice on the phone, they would not help me in either case to have what I wanted done.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT LED TV!!!", "Author": "Lost in L.A.", "ReviewID": "R2G8VQRO4VKZ4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE (12/10/2011): I have just connected the Samsung wireless adapter that I purchased (from another vendor, alas) for a mere $50. It hooked-up instantly, no hassles! And, holy smokes, even with a so-so wireless connection (which is what we have in our living room where the TV is) the adapter immediately a) found the network, b) connected! and c) streams movies off of Netflix and any other online service like silk! This may permanently put Blockbuster out of business. If I could give this TV ten stars, I would!! Couldn't be any happier with it.2nd UPDATE (12/27/2011): In spite of the comments of some other reviewers, I have found the SOUND on this Samsung set to be absolutely 1st rate! I did hook it (for fun) to our stereo system, for additional speakers, but found it to be completely unnecessary. In fact, I now use our Samsung TV to play Pandora radio (which is avail. for FREE via internet) in our living room, and the sound is superb. (Albeit I'm not a fussy audiophile, just a guy who likes music.) Btw, this is truly a \"Smart\" TV: we have total internet connectivity; you can connect almost any device to it; I even hooked my older notebook PC (via SVA patch cable) to the TV, and it worked flawlessly! Using my notebook PC and the internet connection, we turned the TV into a giant 55\" karaoke machine! Good cheesy family fun! I have seen the future, and it is this TV. There's very little it can't do. You'll never leave your house...and that may not be a good thing. Enjoy!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'll second (or third) the five-star reviews here. We just purchased this set, our first foray into plasma/lcd/led land, and we're thrilled with it! Btw, for the uninitiated (as we were), both in terms of price and I'd say picture quality, it goes: plasma (great picture, much cheaper); lcd (a bit more expensive, also a great picture); led (a bit more expensive yet, phenomenal super-crisp picture). Some will say, plasma gives you a more \"authentic\" color-saturated picture -- but if you're putting it in a room with a lot of windows, it's a glass screen so reflections can become a problem. LCD/LEDs are a lot less reflective. We loved the picture quality (and frankly the energy-efficiency) of the LED. Btw, plasmas can get very hot, much like old-fashioned CRT TV's (with bulky picture tubes), maybe even hotter. Go to an electronics store and touch the screens: plasmas - hot, lcd/led - cool.But as far as picture quality on this Samsung: out of this world!! Truly like a home theater. And, yes, as one reviewer noted, shutting-off the Auto Motion feature (or whatever it is) noticeably softens the picture. If anything, the Samsung LED picture is perhaps too crisp for some viewers, but it can be easily adjusted. The remote is just fine, and the on-screen interfaces seem extremely easy and user-friendly. Even this big 55\" model I set-up on my own in about 30-40 minutes. I'll put it this way, if you can set up your home computer (like plug in the monitor & keyboard) you can do this; if you're technologically-challenged, or don't want to wrestle with a large (amazingly lightweight!) TV, then get help. But the assembly & installation is easy.I won't get into all the tech details, as I'm still learning about the set, but the back-panel has ample connectivity. I hooked-up a cheapie Blu-Ray DVD player (also a great Black Friday deal) via the HDMI connection and I was BLOWN-AWAY by the quality of the picture!!Bottom-line, almost any size Samsung LED (even LCD I suspect) is a great purchase. We looked at all the competitors in this price-range (the lower-end of the LED's) and settled, very happily (so far), on Samsung. Btw, don't know what you'll be using this TV for, but this \"base\" model seems to have more than enough bells & whistles for movies, cable, gaming, etc. You WILL have to by a wireless adapter (for about $50 - $75) if you want to use the networking/wireless capability. This set is wireless-capable, but the wireless adapter is NOT included.All around, a great purchase!

Overall this is a very good tv ONLY if you watch TV in a bright room. If you like to watch TV in a darker environment, like me, then this TV may not be right for you. The reason being that the TV suffers from clouding, like a lot of LED/LCD TVs, but it also has a flash light effect. The flash light effect is when there are lights that emit from the corners of the TV towards the center. It is not noticeable if you are watching TV with the lights on or if there is a good amount of light in the room, like from windows. As soon as you turn off the lights then it becomes noticeable. I have read that some TVs are worse then other but this seems to be a problem with these types of TVs. So plain and simple: if you watch TV mainly in a bright room or with lights on then this TV is great and you won't notice any of those defects I described. If you like to watch TV in the dark then most likely those defects will drive you crazy, well at least they did to me. If you like to watch in the dark or a darker environment then go with a plasma, which is what I did and I love it.

Really good picture with a good pop.But I have had the two following issues so far:1. While watching movies using the netflix app, the TV starts blinking. i.e the TV goes completely blank for less than a second or so. Happens about once every 5 minutes - sometimes more often. Surprisingly this seems to be a common issue with many Samsung LED TVs from 2010 and 2011. Just search for \"Samsung LED TV blinking issue\" and you will see plenty of people reporting this online. There has been no solution for this issue so far from Samsung. I am considering returning the TV. Will update review soon.2. The TV has a narrow field of view where the picture contrast remains good. i.e if I move about 30 degrees to the left or right from straight in front of the TV, the pictures looses its beautiful contrast and bright colors a little. This is not a big deal by itself and is just something I wanted to mention in this review. I had read about it in the Consumer Report review of a similar Samsung LED model and so I know that i am not the only one to see this issue. LG TVs (as per Consumer Reports) have a wider field.I am considering if I should return the TV or not as I have only 1 week before I can return it. I probably will if the blinking issue persists or happens outside of Netflix.UPDATE : 10/2/2011I decided to keep the TV as this issue happened only with Netflix and based on my research I concluded that its due to change in resolution that happens in the Netflix stream. i.e it drops to a low res format when there is not sufficient bandwidth and then goes back to hi-res when it can buffer enough. By the way, this is an issue with these TVs as I also heard this from my friend who had bought a similar Samsung model from CostcoUPDATE: 2/25/2012I almost never use the netflix streaming from the TV now as the netflix app on my bluray player is better.

Probably the biggest highlight is the image quality- sharpness & brightness. Ultra clear, ultra crisp and ultra bright. The images seem to coming alive! For the last year I have been considering an upgrade from the 32\" LCD flat panel I've had for the last 4 years. Vizio was the only option I was considering due their value and picture quality. I then saw the Samsung UN46D6050 and the simple yet elegant design of this LCD-LED made me think again. Even with the power turned off- it has a striking character about it.Once you hit the power button you won't want to turn it off. It simply looks brilliant. Everything makes sense in the remote control and it is nice that it has the added \"lighted\" feature in case the room is dark and you are trying to find a particular button. The apps are a nice to have, especially Netflix which streams in HD. A big leap from streaming it on my Wii with 4:3 aspect ratio.

Bless Amazon, they were patient with me and allowed me to try three of these and took each one back.All three sets had different manufacturing dates, separated enough that you could assume they might have parts from different lots.  All three were recent construction, since there were no firmware updates for any of them.The panels are poorly made.  There's no other possible explanation.  There was light bleeding across the screen from all four corners (\"flashlighting\"), and it's bad.  You could see it in the day as clearly as you'd see it at night, and it's there no matter what's on the screen: dark, medium or brightly lit scenes.One of the screens had random bright spots (\"clouding\").  All of them had clouding to the left and right sides, where the LED's are mounted, covering about half the screen.  Clouding tends to wash out the colors leaving you pale, ghostly-looking images on the screen.If the panel quality were not bad enough...they failed in the panel circuitry, too.  All three would (apparently) randomly go in the most intense over-sharpening I've ever seen.  Everything on the screen would go into intense focus, from the closest blade of grass to the leaves on trees in the far background.  That's at least one full step beyond a \"soap opera\" effect.  Images on one of the panels would stutter and judder so badly you'd have thought you were having a stroke, and all three had unacceptable juddering problems.(I was in a BB today to window-shop, and they had both the UN40- and UN32D6000 on display.  Both were juddering badly.  Curious, I drove across town to the other BB, where they only had the 40-inch on display and it was juddering obviously, too.  I should have gone down and looked at these before buying.)Wireless connectivity was odd, too.  I could not successfully connect to Netflix with any of them, but the speed-tests run by Vudu and Hulu when you first connect both had excellent signal strength.AND FINALLY: Although they were very pleasant and very nice people, what Samsung support told me to do was set the screen to it's Standard settings and let it run that way for a week to see if it helped.  That's not a lot of help, but again, they were extraordinarily nice to talk with.I'm going to end this by adding that I tried various components and sources.  It wasn't one blu-ray disc on one player; I tried several discs, both blu-ray and DVD, on two different players and a PS3 console.  It was no better with strong on-air digital signals or streaming through network connections, both wireless and hard-wired.  I didn't stop at one HDMI cable, I used three different, new and certified HDMI 1.4 cables.  I spent at least three hours each evening trying every possible combination of guided calibrations and DIY voo-doo to get something I could live with on all three of the sets.It's the product, not the person.I wish I had learned a great deal more about these before I bought one and used up a lot of Amazon's time and money shipping them back-and-forth.  But look around: if you want to have a 120hz refresh rate in a screen under 40-inches and have no use for 3D, there's basically two available this year, and I went with the Samsung.THIS IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW OF SET #1:Picture Quality: Of the 9 various LCD screens we have, including the PC's and spanning all cost/quality ranges, this is the worst of the batch.A. Flashlighting and edge banding: if my Dell 2209WA is a 10, this is barely a 1.  Bright spots at all 4 corners, brightest at the upper left.  Edge banding left and right, brighter on the left.I'm not that picky for televisions, but these are so bright that they're distracting.  Say you're watching a Blu-Ray at 16:9, not zooming, and you have those narrow black bands top-and-bottom (\"letter-boxing\")?  Your eyes are constantly jumping to that white spot up there.B.  Edge resolution: I mean only that the image gets fuzzy at the inch or inch-and-a-half edge of the screen, not that objects in the \"sweet\" spot are fuzzy.  This is worse in SD broadcasts, but is still there with HD broadcasts and with Blu-Ray.  Again, worse at the top and left.C.  Color gamut: drops off significantly when viewing from above or below the horizontal plane of the screen.  Not a good thing in a bedroom TV because, I don't know about you guys, but that's where I move around the most when watching TV.I have calibrated it as much as possible using Disney's WOW.  I haven't updated the firmware, yet, but that's going to have to have massive effect to make this screen approach acceptable.Interface: Clunky.Why certain screen adjustments are not available with certain devices connected or with some picture settings is a mystery.  Why wouldn't I want the image to auto-adjust size to the screen?  Our LG does this and it works extremely well for getting the best picture quality out of SD formats.  The owner's manual clearly warns to keep the image at full screen size to prevent burn-in (!) but I don't get a \"fill-the-screen\" option and instead have to badly distort the image with some pre-set zoom?Sound: Good.The only TV we have sound issues with is a 24\" Toshiba.  That's tinny.  I'm not sure what everyone is doing - how loud they've adjusted the sound - but these sound fine to me.  I'm not a high-volume kind of a guy, but at default settings, voice quality is excellent, and bass is more than acceptable.  Unless you owned one of those 70's and 80's cabinet TV's with stereo-sized speakers on each side, you won't get great sound out of any portable TV, be it skinny-screen or CRT, so I'm not sure what people are doing when they complain about sound quality.But... no auto sound leveling?  Again, our LG does this and it's great to have.  Satellite subscribers know that when the provider drops one of it's advertisements into a channel's signal, that ad is sent at a 30% or more increase in volume (you hear me DirecTv!?).  An asinine ommission on a roughly $800 set.Stand: Swivels.  I like the pedestal base; it's the beefiest and most stable of the stands so far.  Easy to assemble.Manuals and Instructions: What a joke!  The printed manual is extremely thin and everything else is in the electronic manual, but you have to have an internet connection to get to all of it.  Had to go otu and download the PDF version and print it myself, and even that just can't be complete.  I have questions but no answers.I could go on.  This is a horrible disappointment, not just for a bad screen.  I could replace the set with an identical model and still be very unhappy with the menus, settings, adjustments...  It's just not worth half the asking price, even if the screen were a 9 instead of a 1.We own a 22\" Samsung - the UN22D5003 edge-lit LED/LCD - and that's a great little set.  Because of how much we like it, we jumped into this Samsung UN32D6000.  Now we're going to have to go through the fuss and headache of dragging ourselves back out.Overall, ignoring the picture quality issues, it's like the engineers had a pile of neat technology that they didn't know quite what to do with, so they tossed it all in without worrying too much about it.  They're Samsung, afterall! people will buy it for the name.  But what other brands give us, they skipped past.I'm sorry to all you who swear by Samsung, but last year's LG does almost everything very well (but they havn't released feature-rich 32-inch sets) and this is a turd in a bucket.UPDATE:  As of today (7/17/2011) there are no firmware updates available.  This is also a strange tale: it's not connected wirelessly, so I went to Samsung, downloaded a firmware update that is supposed to be for this model to USB, and tried the USB/Manual update.  No file found.  So I wired it into the router and in fact, there is no update available.  So this is going back for an exchange.I'm getting less-and-less happy with Samsung...UPDATE: 7/20/2011 - Amazon was quick and courteous about sending a replacement, but it's just sitting here unopened.  Stopped in at a BB and a local (frou-frou) audio-video store and have been told by both that they are experiencing higher than expected customer dis-satisfaction with both the D5500 and D6000 series.  Their guess: Samsung is trying out a new \"ultra clear screen\" that has side effect of retaining/reflecting more internal light.These folks aren't techs and this is only their best guess, but the issues they're describing are pretty much exactly what I'm seeing, so the symptoms are the same, whatever the cause.Don't want to open the new box and leave Amazon with two that I've opened and rejected, so I might send them both back at the same time.

It has a fantastic picture with really bright, vivid colors.  Everyone who sees it comments on its classy look and super thin profile.  I'm not sure if the LED lighting produces a better or brighter picture than standard LCDs, but I believe it's worth it simply for the thin profile and lower energy use.  We used the built-in speakers for awhile until we got a sound system, and they worked plenty well and were loud enough.Some people complain about \"flash lighting\" or \"clouding\" with these edge-lit LED TVs.  I can say this hasn't been a problem for me.  With standard day-to-day full color scenes you won't see the lights at all.  You also won't see them on a nearly all black screen, for example movie credits or an app's splash screen, and actually get a very deep, OLED-like black, I'm guessing because the TV is detecting the dark scene and adjusting the LEDs dynamically.  You might only ever see it very faintly in the corners of a widescreen movie with letterbox or on other occasional dark backgrounds, but it's not very noticeable unless you're looking for it.  The backlight brightness doesn't need to be as high as it's set to out of the box and turning it down a bit definitely makes a difference.  All in all it's completely fine to me and I'm glad I didn't spend several hundred more on a unit with local dimming or a full LED array.The other important point is this TV's DLNA capabilities, as this was something that was important to me but was hard to find information about online.  I wanted to use this TV to play videos from my computer to avoiding building an HTPC or buying a dedicated media streamer for the purpose.  I can say that the TV does the job admirably and I have had no need to build or buy another device.  The TV supports high-bitrate MKVs with AC3 and DTS audio.  The only quirk is that it thinks it doesn't know the MKV container format, even though it really does.  The solution to this is simple.  You can either just rename MKVs to AVI, no transcoding necessary, or just enable transcoding in your DLNA server software.  I use Serviio, and I bet the \"transcoding\" it does is really just switching the container format silently for me.  I can't be certain of that, all I know is that MKVs work and the quality looks untouched on the TV.  If you don't use something that offers transcoding, the simple rename will do the trick.  The TV can also handle and output 5.1 audio formats just fine.  Once the video is playing, simply go to the sound settings menu and switch the SPDIF output from PCM to either DTS or Dolby Digital, then connect the TV's optical port to your receiver, and you're done.  Normal fast forward and rewind don't work over DLNA, but it's not a problem - you can pause and play, use the left and right arrows to skip forward or back a certain increment (maybe 30 seconds or something), or you can use the \"time search\" feature to skip around anywhere in the video.  In this respect, the TV's an even better MKV player than Windows Media Center would be, as it seems all that can do is skip in increments.Overall a handsome unit with a great picture, fine speakers if you use them, and solid DLNA capabilities that should replace the need for an HTPC or dedicated media streamer.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Light bleeding problems", "Author": "Stefan", "ReviewID": "R1PGCB428HPXS8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this LED at a local Fred Meyer after reading reviews here on Amazon and other websites. It's a beautiful looking TV, with a very stylish and slick design. It's ultra-thin and all around very nice to look at. Picture quality was actually very good. Although, when you turn on Auto-motion plus (which is designed to reduce blurring and jarring during panned shots) it felt as if you're watching something that was filmed with a cheap handheld camera. Sort of like a soap-opera. After complaining about this at the store, I was told to turn this feature off during movies, which helped. And apparently all LCD/LED TVs that have a similar built in system, have a similar effect when it's turned on.The first issue I had was that I had a lot of trouble getting the sound from my home-theater system to synch with the TV. After adjusting both the TV synching and the home theater synching to the max I got it to a point where it was 'okay' and not so noticeable any longer. Samsung's support was of excellent help with this.My main criticism concerns the light 'bleeding' from all four corners of the screen. My understanding is that many LED TVs have LED lights along their edges only (hence the nomenclature 'edge-lit LED') instead of behind the entire screen, which allows the TVs to become ultra thin. The light is then send from the edges to the center of the TV via some kind of mechanism to backlight the entire image. Well, with this Samsung TV you could clearly see all four corners being a lighter, grey-ish sort of color instead of the dark black that the rest of the image was. It was very distracting during any darker scenes in a movie. The light was literally seeping thru. After I read more reviews online, I realized that this wasn't just a fluke with my particular TV, but that it seemed to be an inherent flaw with the design of this model.I ended up returning the TV (huge struggle in and off itself since Fred Meyer doesn't do returns on open box electronics any longer) and bought an LG TV at Costco instead.

The 7000 does not have this minor ailment.  Audio is just OK, which is understandable when you have 2 small speakers facing out of the back of the set, however, boosting the midrange helps considerable.

I have a large movie collection in divx format stored on a Windows XP computer and the Allshare allows the TV to play them directly over my wired network.  It also plays .vob (DVD format) files.

Can play games while watching TV also.Cons:- I don't know if anyone else experienced this, but when I first powered on the TV for the first time and played a PS3 game on it, the game was lagging so much that I was seriously considering returning the TV. But after the second day the lagging seemed to stop. My guess is that it was a software glitch.- Smart Hub is pretty slow, also when browsing movies,music, or photos on USB devices.- Have to buy Samsung Dongle in order to connect wirelessly to internet.The biggest and most serious CON:Screen Uniformity aka flashlighting!!! (this is a known issue by Samsung 5,6,7,8 series and many other edge lit TVs)All four corners have bright noticeable lights when watching widescreen movies (movies with the black bars) especially in a dark room/at night.Only way to reduce the light is to turn down the dynamic contrast, this means sacrificing the sweet LED picture contrast (whats the point of having it in the first place, if you can't enjoy it to its full potential?).For me personally the cons outweighs the bad. I bought this TV almost %50 off from its original price so I'm not that upset about it. But if you are going to spend close to $2,000 for this model, I would advise you to not buy this TV.

First of all, I used to have a 55\" LCD 850 Series which was purchased back in 2009.  That TV also had the same issue as this TV.To start, I called Samsung to complain about a clouding effect which is the main reason for my 3 Star Review.  My definition of clouding is the white effect in a totally black screen when watching movies, viewing your laptop, etc.  I had light coming through all four corners of the screen, and also some white (appearing as clouds) throughout the middle of the screen.  I would have thought after two years when the 55\" 850 Series was purchased that this issue would have finally been corrected; Apparently not!When I called Samsung, they began trouble shooting the TV.  After the trouble shooting failed, they immediately scheduled an authorized Samsung dealer to contact me in regards to the issue, and have it serviced immediately.  A new panel was ordered (which happened to take over a week) and then installed.  Honestly, clouding seems to be worse compared to the original panel.  So as you can imagine, I am not at ALL happy about this.  And just for reference, the back-light is set to 13 and the contrast is set to 95, which is what the Authorized Dealer suggested.  Well guess what...I can still see the clouds.My other complaint on the TV is the remote.  IMHO, the center/enter button which is surrounded by the up/down left/right arrows (navigation buttons) should be raised.  At night, I don't want to look at my remote to make sure I'm pressing the center/enter button.  This is somewhat of a nuisance and think this button could have been engineered much better.Additionally, digital streaming of movies through Amazon Prime is not compatible.  So your Prime Membership will not work with this TV if you are looking to stream movies from Amazon.Apps are slow to load most of the time.  No way to download apps that I want, including Amazon Prime and Yahoo.Other than that, I will update this review as needed since I purchased the TV September 1st, and today is October 7th, 2011.*****************************************************************************************************************************December 8th, 2011 UPDATE:  Due to my ongoing problems with \"clouds\" after a Samsung Authorized Service Center replaced my LCD Panel (clouds were worse), Samsung's Executive Service Department contacted me and so far I have been pleased with the communications.  They offered to send me out a replacement TV and due to my inconvenience, they are upgrading my model to the 6300.  The only difference is that this TV will have a web browser where the 6000 does not.  I probably could have gotten a 3D TV had I asked, but wasn't interested in the technology at this time being that it is so new.  Not to mention, extended 3D viewing can't be real good for your eyes.  I will keep everyone updated once I receive my replacement TV.  One thing is certain -- Samsung does stand behind their product and goes the extra mile to make things right.*******************************************************************************************************************************December 19th, 2011 UPDATE:  Received new TV today.  However, it is the 6000 Series and not the 6300 as they promised and documented.  Made a call to Samsung and they were apologetic.  They are shipping out ANOTHER TV along with a $50 Best Buy Gift Card.  Hopefully, it's the right model this time and hopefully the card will have money on it.  ;o)  If not, maybe I'll just call again and push for a 55\" big screen.  AYE YAI YAI...*******************************************************************************************************************************December 20th, 2011 UPDATE:  I received a phone call from a different representative today, and she requested that I take a picture of the tag on the back of the TV that shows the Model # and Serial #, although I recited this information to a previous supervisor/manager yesterday.  She said they would not be sending out the replacement TV until this information was provided.  As you could imagine, I about went into orbit.  So, I demanded to speak with another manager in the Executive Relations Department.  After a long hold, the manager finally got on the phone.  She asked what she could do, and I told her \"Let's just forget about it.  Pick up your TV and refund my money.  I don't need to be inconvenienced any further and take offense to this ridiculous request, as though I'm being dishonest.  Further, I supplied the information from the back of the TV to another manager/supervisor and she confirmed that this was the TV that was sent to me, and that it is absolutely positively the 6000 model.  Let's just call it a day and I'll buy from a different manufacturer.\"At this point, I don't think she liked the thought of losing me as a customer.  So she extended this offer:  With her sincere apology and everything I have gone through, she will now move me into the 7000 Series, and she was even willing to give me a bigger screen size.  I told her that it wouldn't be necessary and I'll stick with the 40\".  For my inconvenience, she is sending me a 7000 Series with the $50 Best Buy Gift Card as was previously promised to me.  Although I didn't want a 3D model, I appreciated the gesture and accepted.  Now let's see if I get the right model this time!*********************************************************************************************************************************December 26th, 2011 UPDATE: Well, what a belated Merry Christmas to me. Today I received the Samsung 7000 Series TV, in a 46\". So far, the TV and remote are AWESOME! I am very happy. And finally, NO CLOUDS!!! There is some light coming in from the four corners and this I can live with. No more white light clouding effect in the middle or other parts of the screen!!!  The manager/supervisor called me today and we chatted. I informed her that I was just on my way back from Best Buy as I had to purchase a new Full-Motion Wall Mount, as my previous mount would not work for the 46\". She stated that they had no more 40\" / 7000 Series in the warehouse (I didn't think they even existed, but didn't argue) and that I was actually supposed to receive it on Wednesday. She was happy to hear that I received it so quickly and also advised me that my Best Buy Gift card would be increased to $100 and that should cover the majority of the 3D glasses. She stated if I have any further problems, that she will go ahead and put me in the 7900 Series if needed. I was very appreciative, so we'll see how everything goes from this point on. Because of this, I have upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars and Samsung has once again earned my business.

It does stream Netflix and Hulu Plus, along with other video sources, so one is left with the impression that there is no technical reason for this restriction.When I contacted Samsung and Amazon support, neither organization offered any hope in this matter. Samsung implied that the reason for the limitation was that only Series 7 and higher TVs can stream Amazon video, but according to the qualified TV list on Amazon's site, the following \"non-Series-7\" TVs all can stream their video: UN32C6500, UN40C6400, UN40C6500, UN46C6400, UN46C6500, UN55C6400, UN55C6500, UN60C6400, and UN65C6500.

The UN32D6000 delivers results that are perfectly respectable, and better than I expected. But still, not exceedingly so.**In this review, I won't be offering any insights or comments regarding the UN32D6000's performance as a television for cable, sports, & movies or Samsung's SmartHub features.**At first, I used a DVI-cable with a VGA-connector as my main input.  With a bit of adjustment, the TV did well enough when compared to a standard computer monitor - internet and document text came through clean with little to no initial blurring.  Pictures were vivid and colorful.  And, as this is a television, the viewing angles were far and beyond an improvement over monitors.**For you amateur and professional photographers, however: LCD TVs don't deliver the high quality color spectrum control or pixel density that LCD monitors provide.**Going back to PC gaming: I ran into awful latency issues while using a DVI cable.  The frame stuttering and lags made me cringe at the thought of having tanked $700. I scoured the internet for hours looking for answers, and came up with little or nothing.  A call to Samsung customer service didn't fix anything, either.The workaround proved to be an HDMI cable.  And that's all it took to solve my latency problem.  Note, your computer should include an HDMI-input and HDMI-compatible video adapter in order to make this workable.In brief:1.) the HDMI-cable was connected to the 'HDMI 1/DVI' port2.) the remote control was used to scan for a 'Source' - just press the 'Source' button3.) I selected the port in use - 'HDMI 1/DVI' and hit the remote's 'Tools' button4.) there's a feature to 'Edit Name'5.) once in the 'Edit Name' menu, I selected 'DVI PC' in the list6.) this adjustment can be made to set the viewing mode for different activities as well, e.g. there's 'Blu-Ray', 'Camcorder', 'HD DVD', et al.This turned out to be the best choice by far.  After playing countless hours of 'Batman: Arkham City', 'Battlefield 3', 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2', 'Skyrim', & 'The Witcher 2' - lagging turned into an absent memory.**For all you console gamers: this Samsung does provide a 'Game Mode' in the main menu - when in use with an HDMI cable - that will work hand-in-hand with your Xbox, PS, or Wii.  Again, this is meant for use with consoles.  Enabling 'Game Mode' on a PC did not deliver the results I wanted, and was largely disappointing.**In summary, I was looking for a large display, but didn't want to fork over $$$$ for a 30\" NEC or Dell monitor.  And, as an avid PC gamer - generally spending upwards of $2K whenever building a new computer - I was looking to spend money, but not extravagantly so.

The 6000 series will NOT do Amazon VOD (because it doesn't support the Yahoo! Widgets).  The literature will lead you to believe otherwise.  This has to be a marketing gimmick to drive you to a higher model like the 6300 or 6400.  I was hoping to sign up for Amazon Prime, but since I was fooled, I don't think I will.

I like using the ESPN app and leaving all the score updates on my screen while I watch other games.  Others say that Netflix works pretty well, too.CONS:  Some flashlighting.  Nothing that can be done about it.  You can minimize it so that it isn't too bad(again...research your proper settings), but some flashlighting will always be present on these TV's...that's what edge lit LED's are all about.  If you continue to stare at the flashlighting during black or dark scenes...it will bother you.  But I just ignore it and enjoy the excellent picture on the TV the other 99% of the time.  I have slight flashlighting in all 4 corners of my tv...and so do most other people who buy this TV.  It's not a big deal unless you are a huge TV snob.So, overall, I give this 4 out of 5 stars.  The flashlighting and slow apps keep it from getting 5 stars.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Trust me, I researched...", "Author": "bpsixstrng", "ReviewID": "RUXJOOKBIRTFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched for months for the exact TV I was going to get for my budget etc, and this is what it came to.Even if my budget were higher, I still would've picked this TV just in a bigger size.The picture is awesome (Samsung is the best out there in my opinion).There are plenty of inputs.The set up is easy.The angles are great.

The brightness and colour are almost obnoxiously awesome.I bought this TV also to replace my 26\" PC monitor. After updating my Nvidia's driver and adjusting the sharpness (+ other settings), I was able to get the picture nearly as good as the monitor's, but brighter and more colourful. Games and video are better looking than on the monitor, however webpages have a slightly less natural look. Overall, great.Note, despite what the reviewer below stated, the optical output does throw 5.1, not just stereo. I use a Harmon Kardon receiver for all sound so I have not heard the built-in speakersA huge plus about this unit is the option to adjust or even disable the Auto Motion Plus. This is a huge benefit if you don't like the soap opera look but prefer a more classic film speed.My only two complaints are that you can't name inputs and the TV gives off enough heat to cozy up a studio apartment.Overall, and again, you probably can't find a better gaming/movie/PC TV out there for the price.

You can control volume, inputs, and even turn it on/off with just connecting a HDMI cable.CONS:- As other reviewers have mentioned, you can see some light bleeding on the corners in dark scenes when you have a dark room.

In fact, most people will never notice it unless you mention it.- The \"Smart\" part of the TV (SmartHub) is not smart at all.

After several months of use, and tweaking the settings, I'm very happy with this TV.At first, the TV had one issue that bothered me quite a bit.  When watching normal TV, it seemed that the picture would judder...and this was not during fast action scenes or anything like that.  This was during sit-coms when a person was just moving around.  So I played around with the Motion settings and just couldn't seem to get rid of it.  It was getting to the point that I was about to return it.  Thankfully, since I bought it during a holiday season, the return policy was lengthened so I had an extra month to assess the TV and play around with it a bit more.After a bit of research, I found another setting on the TV that I had not changed during my trials.  It's the \"Game Mode\".  Basically when you turn Game Mode ON, all of the \"intelligence\" of the TV is turned OFF.  So the TV displays only the signal that's coming in without any intervention.  It doesn't do anything for motion blur, etc...Now with the Game Mode set to ON, I have no issues while watching any kind of programming.  So I'm glad I kept the TV.I got the 60\" which is quite large but fits nicely in my family room which is 16x20 (TV is on the long wall...)  I mounted it above my fireplace and it looks great.  It's very thin and the border is small and unobtrusive.  Also I like that all of the connections are on the same plane as the TV so you can get the TV pretty tight to the wall without smashing and bending the cables.Sound quality out of the speakers is quite good for normal programming.

It is 3D ready, but 3D is just a gimmick that is not going to catch any sort of mass use fire in my opinion, so this option was not important to me.I used to be an audio and videophile as a hobby until children came along.  We re-purposed my theatre room for a more family-friendly room where the kids can have their toys and play space as well.  This meant a new television since my previous one in that room was a big and boxy rear projection which took up too much space although for 8 years old was still on top of its game.Enter this Samsung TV!  I already own a Samsung 32\" LCD TV for another room in our house and love it, so going with Samsung again was a no-brainer for me.  I weighed the pros and cons of LCD vs. LED and figured that LED does have more benefits of LCD, but comes at a heftier price.  However this Samsung TV was on sale when I bought it. Not sure if this means Samsung has a model to replace it or not.The picture is fantastic!  I was able to spend some time fine dialing in the picture to THX specs.  (This is not something 95% of people do).  If this is something you will do, it will take considerably longer since one of the cons of this television is that you have to adjust the video and audio settings per each component port... not a blanketed setting for the entire TV no matter what component is selected.Another Con is that Samsung by default turns on this feature that has to do with Fast Motion called \"Auto Motion Plus\".  It seems like a great idea and it really wows you at first at how the screen blows any other TV out of the water because it is so darn crystal clear with movements and such.  However, this also causes \"jitteryness\" and \"choppyness\".  Its almost as if the built in technology can't keep up... sort of like a computer that's processing too much so your mouse is jittery on the screen.  Once I turned this off all was fine.  This should be turned off anyway since the video feeds should never be altered by a secondary source to try and enhance them.As far as the \"Smart TV\" technology goes... I like it, but its interface on the TV is not very easy to figure out.  Let's face it, we live in an iApple generation and we have gotten so used to the simple, easy to use and figure out interfaces of our devices.  The Samsung Smart TV interface falls a little short of that.  I connected it to my home network via ethernet cable since it has a built in ethernet port no problem and was online with it in seconds.  We have been enjoying the Netflix app on it, and it seems to come with a ton of other apps for music, social networking etc... all of which we will not use so I cannot speak to how well they work.  If you want to use the Smart TV feature with your wireless network, you will have to purchase the USB Samsung WiFi adapter separately.All in all, we love this Television!  It displays our Satellite service beautifully!  We still have an old school Progressive scan DVD player since the only DVD's we have and buy are for kids.  That DVD player is connected to the component port and displays just fine too.  The television is thin giving it a cool sleek look.  For an LED TV under $1000 you can't beat it unless you want to get the popular \"V\" TV that skimps on granularity of picture settings and is made with very cheap hardware.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this TV...

It is amazing how prices on these TVs go down.The 6000 series is the lowest you should go ( which really has more than what I really want as I don't care about 3D now). Why? Because it is lowest series which include Samsung Apps which is basically the Smart HUB.For those who don't know, Samsung Apps is just freaking awesome. It allows you to watch Youtube or use other video applications. It has social plugins and better than ever, it allows you to play Videos from your external Hard Disk Drive or AllShare computer on your network. It allows you to also use Samsung iPhone app to control the TV as long as they're both connected to the same Access Point ( or basically same network/router ).Again, the awesomeness comes if you have HiDef media on your HDD like MKV movies. It has crazy engine to play 1080p movies with no hassle.Cons:- The remote is not really that responsive. I set about 4 feet away and it does not respond quickly like my 2010 Samsung 55 inch LED HDTV does.- Smart HUB is always checking/installing updates almost every time I use it. It also takes some time to process the content of the HDD to show you what you have.- I have Amazon Prime and it disappoints me that this TV and its series are not Prime-friendly.

Don't go for higher series like D6300 because it adds nothing but a web browser.

Only tool needed to attach the supplied stand was a screwdriver. The supplied stand is well made, wide, and heavy. The screen doesn't wobble once affixed.After a few set-up menus (use settings, time/date, etc.) the TV is ready to go.

So, don't be surprised if the settings appropriate for you aren't as bright as you saw in a store.The colors, dynamic range, contrast, and 120Hz refresh rate is excellent for today's HD movies, sports, and fast-paced gaming. There is a visible difference between 720p and 1080p as well as the 60Hz and 120Hz. The higher resolution will give you sharper, more detailed images and the faster refresh rates reduce or eliminate ghosting. Of course, to take full advantage of all these features, you'll need your inputs to be HD and via an HDMI cable.The speakers provide good sound, but it is not rich-sounding due to the very small woofers. But you can't expect great sound from such small speakers.Thankfully, there are a ton of ports on this set to satisfy your entertainment needs.

And it is the best (and most expensive) least-informed purchase I've ever made.Right out of the box, the TV looks fantastic. The bezel is 1.25\" on the sides and 1.5\" on the top and bottom. The TV itself is very thin (just over 1\") and can be wall-mounted or put on a stand (included). The stand itself looks very sharp and does the TV justice.The picture quality is very good. Movies look fantastic; my Blu-rays can finally shine in all their 1080p glory. A note about movies: a lot of reviews comment on the \"smoothness\" or the \"soap opera look\" when watching movies. This effect can be mitigated by turning off Auto Motion Plus (it's turned on by default). However, even with Auto Motion Plus (which is Samsung's fancy name for frame interpolation) turned off, you can still see a bit of that smoothness, but it's not as pronounced. I highly recommend visiting a local TV store and seeing for yourself how movies look on 120Hz TVs (be sure to ask the sales rep to turn off frame interpolation).Gaming is fantastic on the TV. I'm using a PS3 connected via HDMI, and once you enable game mode, the input lag is nonexistent. This is a huge deal for me as my previous TV (a 5 year old Samsung DLP) had horrendous input lag even with game mode enabled.The sound, on the other hand, is not that great. It lacks bass (as expected) and sounds tinny. I ended up buying speakers for it, and if this is going to be your main TV, I suggest you do, too.I have not used any online apps so I can't comment on them. Note that you'll need to buy a separate wifi dongle if you don't fancy the idea of using an ethernet cable.What I love about the TV is that it can play videos that you store on an external hard drive (including mkv). This feature is what pushed the TV from 4 stars to 5.Overall, if you're looking to buy a solid HDTV without breaking the bank, this is a fantastic buy!", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the $", "Author": "Matthew N.

Nonetheless there are no shortage of HDMI ports so I hook up to the laptop to stream browser content since Samsng felt that an internet connected TV need not have a browser to actually consume internet content (they felt child's cartoon apps were more useful).The speakers are okay if sitting close and have a small room but fall short of true surround or good sound quality so I'm using a Yamaha home theater system to solve that.All in all I'm very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS TV!", "Author": "joe nonose \"mac dre\"", "ReviewID": "R2W482PYOF8C4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded from a vizio 720p lcd and this blows that out of the water obviously.

Colors are vibrant, blacks are solid, and shadow detail is great for a LED-backlit monitor, apart from a caveat...Once calibrated, color gamut and shadow detail are above average for a LED-backlit LCD monitor.  Indeed, the panel technology used (VA) allows for deeper blacks compared to IPS (which has better shadow detail and color gamut.)Light bleed is a minor issue.  This is normal for LCD panels, regardless of backlighting type.  This set performs better than competing models I've gawked at, but the manufacturing process, even at the best of times, can't catch every unit passing through their QC channel.Clouding (white splotches/circles) is also a minor issue.  Especially compared to the previous LED-backlit set I viewed, the one with the yellow subpixel...Blacks are very deep.Shadow detail looks very good, though some darker grays/near-blacks have a slightly blue tinge (but not bad), and there isn't much in the way of \"black crush\" - which is a problem common in all LCD monitors where darker grays and shadow detail are presented as being completely black.  Especially compared to other brands and models that are 40\", this Samsung does a VERY good job with shadow detail and color gamut.  I've seen better, but my review is an amalgamation of good and bad aspects and when all is said and done, I like this TV set a lot.And shadow detail does seem above average, as it's clear the set is using a VA panel rather than IPS... But I was hoping Samsung used its own S-PVA panel technology, but that is not to be.  While the set's quality is otherwise VERY high, the unit I purchased has a very poor viewing angle and colors get washed out from surprisingly slim angles.  Had Samsung used their own S-PVA panel technology in their own models, and S-PVA is far superior to the other VA panel types I've read about, I'd give this set 5 stars with absolute ease.  Unless Samsung is ashamed of using their own technology, of course...One workaround is to raise the brightness setting a couple notches above calibration, even if it does mean reducing black levels, but would be on par with my old Sony.  So, ultimately, it's give-or-take and, either way, it's passable.[...]One picture.  One thousand words.  But proof Samsung does make a competing panel technology and it is not being used in this model.  Hence my disappointment.  I just don't know why they wouldn't use their own technology in all of their own TV sets.My only other gripe is the lack of native composite and component inputs.  Two adapter cables (one for each type) are included, complete with disclaimer that actually reads this:CAUTIONINSERT SECURELYLEST SHOULD BEDETACHED IN SETNow, if you look at these adapter cables, they are solidly made - and given how the plug-ins on the set are devised, there is nothing that COULD get detached into the set. And if you don't plug them in securely, they'll fall out.  Not sure what they mean...  still, after a few centuries, it really is nice reading the word \"lest\" again...Having said all that, this is NOT a bad set.  It could just be better, especially for the retail price.  But, as far as LED-backlit sets go, this is above-average and the other brand I used, which sold for the same price, is a far poorer model despite the extra pixel gimmick.Best of all, in 5 years' time, what will replace the D6000 will probably be rock-solid in concept, design, and execution.Addendum:  10/07/2011:Overall, this is a great set, worthy of the 4-star rating, but it would be wrong not to mention this update.  I still recommend this set for HD material only.  But this set has problems displaying standard-def material.  \"The Simpsons\" and \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" both prominently show juddering and interlacing problems while panning.  At first I thought it was the DVD player.  Multiple players, including a Blu-Ray device, all had the same problem.  Even setting the player from \"auto\" to \"480i\" did not fully rectify this problem.  Indeed, the player should be capable of seeing the DVD as standard broadcast material (480i).  And, at 480i, what will 1080P source material look like...I used only HDMI connections.  I tried another HDMI cable.  It is not the cable...  Enabling every smoothness setting had no effect.  The problem IS the set's integrated upconverter.  Maybe buying a $500 DVD set can compensate.  Nor should anybody have to; my 32\" 720P TV set made in 2007 and costing as much as this 40\" set should NOT be showing a smoother, crisper display.  I know upconverting will reveal limitations of source material, but fluidity should not be juttered, or in any other way affected.

There is no built-in wireless card - but that is no big deal as you can always run a wire from your router to the TV and perhaps a wired connection is faster and sturdier than a wireless one; so I do not consider it a con at all.Cons:AllShare (proprietary software to connect various compliant devices with the TV and vice versa) documentation in the user manual is sketchy - you may have to go online to learn more.

The menu is better-organized, with more logically-grouped choices, and one can more-easily customize the picture to personal taste. When I set up my picture, I pick two stations to alternate back-and-forth: one sporting event, and [usually] an in-studio program, such as a news program, the one for outdoor skin tones, and grass/dirt tones, the other for indoor skin tones, and clothing. The sporting event is also good for adjusting sharpness, with the crowd shots--one can view just how sharp the picture needs to be by watching the crowd, while making the adjustments. Fast-motion adjustments can now be effected, as well, for those who are of a mind to do it. Adjustments can be made for clarity, when watching events that rush by quickly--say, for example auto races, ski-flying, or chase scenes.This model also now displays what type of signal is being received, so that when switching stations, and there is a lag time, you'll see, in the upper left-hand corner of the screen, a display advising that there is a change in the nature of the signal--thus creating the lag time.The Auto Motion Plus feature is an enhancement that hugely--though subtly--improves all motion--even in older movies--so that the motion appears much more lifelike and immediate than any television duplication I've seen previously. The blur around the edges of the moving characters is gone, and their motion is far more vivid. It has to be seen--it can't really be explained. I know of no other TV that accomplishes this.The first time I bought an HD LED TV, I went through the Consumer Reports studying and personal research for months, and settled firmly on Samsung as the brand of choice, and I have seen no reason to switch.

I went with this.The TV itself is beautiful.  Very slim and there's not too much extra.  Samsung knows how to design a TV.  The picture quality on this TV is outstanding.  I play PS3 on this almost as much as I watch TV and I notice absolutely no negative effects with this tv.  No ghosting or anything of the sort.  It's damn near perfect in every way.  Sound quality is outstanding as well.Other positives:  It's a Smart TV, so it has apps and connects to the internet.  For me the best ones are Netflix and Samsung's Allshare (DLNA Client).  Netflix goes without saying.  I download a lot of TV and Movies to my computer, and with Allshare, I can stream everything directly to my TV.  It's really a time saver and I can't imagine not having it.The cons that I would say are:1. Depending on your lighting situation, you can get some to a lot of glare.2. The flashlighting effect IS there.  BUT, I rarely notice it.  I usually notice it playing PS3 when an all black loading screen comes up, in the DARK.  Other than that, never.  If you turn your brightness up too much, it's more pronounced, but I would say that if that's the case, you haven't calibrated your set properly.3. Allshare doesn't support every codec.  I'm not sure if that's the TV's fault, or the protocol.  Either way, I just download everything as an .avi file and it works.  No biggie.  If I want better quality, I can use my PS3.4. Volume consistency.  I'd say this is more the fault of the inputs rather the TV, but I can be streaming something at volume 20, and then jump to my cable box and it's BLASTING, and I have to turn it down to 7.  I just wish the TV could normalize the volume.5. This is completely on Samsung, but they abandon their old TVs software wise.

Ruddygore \"Ruddy\"", "ReviewID": "R1ET4F3RNZUGG0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was in the market finally for a large flat screen TV after my 27 inch Sony VEGA's picture started to go after 10+ years. I took a stroll over to the local blue box store to check out selections in person to get an idea of what was out there as this is the first time I've been in the market.My eyes were immediately drawn to the 55 inch Samsung. I wasn't planning on making a purchase until I saw the price - it was only $999. After talking to one of the store reps he checked and found that the actual sales price was $1500, but said I could get it for $999. It was on back order, so I figured I had nothing to lose. I could do my research and cancel the order if necessary. I checked out a lot of the reviews here and was mainly concerned with the \"flash-lighting\" and \"clouding\" mentioned by some reviewers.After having this set for over 2 months, I'm very very happy with my purchase. The flash-lighting and clouding do exist, but you only notice this when sitting in a very dark room. Even then, these issues were hardly noticeable. I know some reviewers have stated that it was a deal breaker and they returned the set. Not sure if this was because the flaws were worse on their sets or if price came into play. I think if I paid $2000 - $2500, I might have been a bit more upset and may have considered returning it. However, I tend to doubt it. The TV isn't perfect, but it has an awesome picture for the most part. The flash-lighting and clouding do exist to a point, but not so much that the average user is going to notice in most cases. Overall I'm very happy with the product - especially with the price which was pure luck.Update 8/2012 - Still love the tv and have received a lot of comments on the picture quality. Even today, the price I got last year is still a deal. I still don't have it hooked to the internet as I only have DSL which is a bit too slow to take care of web content that you can access through Smart Hub. I have started playing around with playing movie content in HD mp4 off an external hard drive which I've plugged directly into the USB port. I especially like this feature because I can rip all the kids movies onto the hard drive and I don't have to worry about them breaking the DVD player or scratching up the disks. Picture is still awesome - and it's gotten better as I've become more familiar with settings over time. Sometimes with darker movies - such as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows - you need to tweak the setting to see clearly during the night time scenes. There is also a little bit of a lag when browsing folder content on the hard drive. It's not like a computer where you click and it pops up, it may take 10-20 seconds to load content as you drill into the sub folders on your drive. However you can play music, look at pictures and slide shows, and watch movies loaded to digital format. This was something I wasn't aware of when I bought the set and it was a nice surprise.Update 11/2012 - Still very pleased with the TV. However it turns out that the unit I received had a problem with the HDMI ports. I originally thought it was my Blue Ray player, but after purchasing another Samsung TV and doing some troubleshooting, I figured out it was the TV. Samsung has a 1 year warranty. I opened a ticket with their customer service dept via the internet, who sent out a tech to replace the HDMI ports on the TV. I was charged nothing and the problem was resolved.

I'm glad I did.  For starters, I ordered it on a Monday and received it that same Friday with free shipping!  Within an hour of using the TV it developed a bad red colored pixel at the top of the screen.  It wasn't noticeable except during dark scenes.  I followed the online return process and with in minutes I had a reply apologizing for the problem and telling me that another TV would be arriving the following Friday and that UPS would come by on Monday to pick up the bad TV.  The return worked with no problems and I didn't have to pay return shipping!  I love Amazon.The UN46D6000 has a great picture.  I find the factory presets work well but I plan on manually tweaking them when I get time.  The motion blur reduction works well for me when I have it set to \"Clear\".  For my Xbox I shut off the blur reduction entirely to eliminate lag.  The Smart Hub is okay.  That's not why I bought it, though.  Some of the apps are great.  I like the Google Calendar and Google Maps.  They work great.  I was able to show my son the Pyramids in Egypt and the Sphinx right from the app.  A lot of the other apps seem to be garbage.  I tried a solar system app and dinosaur app.  The descriptions were in broken English and made no sense.  The apps themselves looked great but were unusable because of the horrible translation.  I haven't tried Netflix or Blockbuster.  I don't use Facebook or Twitter so I can't speak to those either.  Several other apps I tried that would turn your TV into a picture frame displaying classic works of art were deceiving.  The app download was free but you had to pay to get the content.I watched a few minutes of Tangled on this and was blown away at how fantastic it looked.  The movement of her hair looked so natural I couldn't believe it.  I also watched a classic movie, Calamity Jane, on it.  I have never seen a classic movie look so good on a TV before.  I felt like I was watching them on stage.  I watched the AFC and NFC championship games on this as well and the colors really popped without being over saturated and the text on the uniforms was easily readable using the default Dynamic setting.  At certain times I have noticed the light bleeding in the corners that others have mentioned, but it really is not a bother even for most darker scenes.I suppose you could find another 46\" TV cheaper but the others I looked at just didn't have the same picture quality.

Whenever I launched the app, a dialogue box popped up, displaying 'Connecting...' and froze. I'd needed to power off the TV to get out of it.Before calling into tech support, I performed several resets of both the TV (essentially setting it to factory defaults) and Smart Hub. I also upgraded the firmware to the latest version (1025), which also took the Netflix app to the latest (3.1.3). Nothing helped.There was also an update notification for the 'Your Videos' app which kept popping up but no matter what I did, it looked as if the update couldn't be applied. I kept pointing out to the support people that the update problem was clearly related to the Netflix issue, but as others here have pointed out, they just kept blaming Netflix. Whenever they tried to close the call out, I reminded them of the update problem and pointed out that it was theirs to solve.Anyway, the support person gave me a code to punch into my remote (FF, 289, RW) which allowed me to change the 'Internet Service Region' on my TV. She had me switch over to Canada and back to the US. I was surprised that she didn't ask me to try and connect to Netflix while it was configured for Canada, but whatever. Shortly thereafter, she gave up and gave me yet another phone number for the 'Samsung Apps' people. This was tier 2 support, mind you.Before calling, I set the region to Canada again and clicked 'Your Videos' (which had previously always resulted in an update error). This time, it appeared to connect to the update server, it applied the update and, lo and behold, everything began to work, including Netflix. I changed the region back to the US and I'm up and running.My best guess is that although the Netflix app was up-to-date, it relied on a service or function of some other app which needed to the updated. And it seems that Samsung's update server, rather than Netflix, was screwing me over.Also, a warning for anyone who starts a support ticket via the support site's chat option. I did exactly that and spent 2 hrs with them, after which he gave me a 14-character (alphanumeric) 'Issue ID' and told me he was escalating the ticket to tier 2. Unfortunately, I had to hit the road and explicitly asked if I could start up another chat session later in the day and be immediately escalated to tier 2 with the issue ID. He assured me that was the case. When I tried, I was told I had to dial into the support system, as tier 2 didn't offer chat sessions. Frustrated, I called in and the automated system asked me for a 10-digit 'Transaction Number'. Since I had a 14-character ID, I was forced to request an agent. I gave her the issue id and she informed me the format was incorrect. I explained everything and she insisted I'd have to start over with her. She was rude and condescending throughout.She kept talking to me as if I were crazy for expecting to be able to escalate from the web site to the phone. I had to get just as gruff with her and I pointed out that if there wasn't a mechanism for that, Samsung shouldn't tell customers it's supported. Inversely, if it is supported, the process is obviously broken since she claimed to not recognize the format of the issue ID I was given by the web support people.Anyway, in the end I did indeed start over with her but insisted on giving her the 2-day synopsis of everything I'd done to that point before she began her troubleshooting. After relating all that, she immediately told me I needed to contact Netflix. \"If all the other apps work, then it's obviously a Netflix problem\". I was only able to get her to escalate by pointing out the update issue described above wasn't a Netflix responsibility and it was Samsung's to resolve. She escalated me with a terse \"ThanksforcallingSamunghaveaniceday<CLICK>\". in the end, the problem was resolved as described above.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "R2MO2X8X9G95YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the 60in TV during the Black Friday sale.

Image quality is superb and beats the Samsung 42\" LCD in the living room.  I purchased the Samsung wireless USB adapter, TV picked this up with no issues.

Then after TV restart another update is needed.  This to me means Samsung is trying update these applications to make them better.  All the applications work they could just all work better.  Or perhaps be more useful.One of the main reasons why I brought this TV was for the DLNA ability.  This works but could work better.  I have a D-LINK DNS-323 NAS server.  Some of the content (wma, mpg) files can be read off this server.  Other files with this same exact format can not be read.  I do not understand why, something with the codec or audio. I attempted to convert my .vob files into this format using different codec and could not find a match the TV could display.  Maybe it can not translate all these files on the fly. I do not know.  I do not know if you are going to find a 'Smart TV' able to read any file format off a network connected storage device.This was not unexpected.  I read reviews about this not working before I brought this TV. So I then installed this service called Serviio on my local Windows 7 machine.  This piece of software translates movies on the fly into a format the TV can read.  The software picks up the TV.  This piece of software needs to be installed on a windows based machine to it can translate the media.  I then mapped a network drive to the NAS server.  I then setup Serviio to read this mapped drive on my local machine.  The TV is then able to display basically any type of format I place on the NAS.  The TV streams these files without any issues.  I can only pause and play the movie, no fast forward or rewind.  I can however do this locally with a flash drive plugged into the TV.

After bringing it home, turning it on and seeing the difference in the picture, I was hooked on LED 1080p TVs.So now I had to replace the TV in the bedroom. Where I live I can park between 2 stores, the warehouse store that has to do with costs (would have bought here if they had this model, their customer service is awesome), and an electronic store that deals with buys (btw this store has the worst customer service, 1.5 hours in store and not asked if I needed help once). I spent several hours going back and forth comparing the TV's at both stores.What I realized was that my $350 budget needed to be increased to $900 if I wanted the TV I wanted. So I came home without a TV that day, yet determined to buy a 32\" 1080p LED LCD Smart TV that looked good, and the Samsung UN32D6000 was the preferred set. The Vizio was ugly, and the other brands I had never heard of.Finding the Amazon warehouse with open box buys was my ticket to the new TV I wanted.

My concern is that the light leakage (which IS a problem) may be worse or totally unacceptable with the new panel.  It now seems that my choice is between Samsung and LG because Sony is now Sammy and I want to stay with LCD/LED technology. This TV looks absolutely stunning when all factors are working but it's been a crappy road so far.

The multiple input options was another important selling point.The 120Hz did help alleviate some motion anomalies.However, there were some deficits to this model:Light bleed at each corner.  At each of the 4 corners, light shone out in an approximately 2\" triangle.  It was most noticeable when viewing 3:4 media.Audio was markedly less clear.  Compared to the Samsung 46\" LCD unit, the audio lacked clarity and required higher volume settings.I watch a variety of video in differing aspects - 16:9, 3:4, full screen, letterbox. On other Samsung models, changing the aspect was relatively straight-forward, a couple of keystrokes.  This model required more obscure finagling to change the view.Again, I use several different input sources.  The buttons on the remote control for changing source input are not logically placed.Maneuvering the digital manual was clumsy.

The picture quality is awesome, local and internet streaming work perfectly, and I was extremely satisfied with this unit, until...About a week after my 1 year warranty expired, I began to have problems with the ethernet adapter on the tv. I called Samsung to see what troubleshooting steps I could take to resolve my issue. The problem was that no matter what cable I used or what port on the router was used, the tv could not connect to my network. (Keep in mind that I am a network technician and understand how networks work, and knew exactly what the problem was.) After relaying that same information to multiple agents when calling Samsung, every time I called they wanted me to go through the same troubleshooting steps. I informed them that the problem was with the ethernet adapter on the television. When the tv was plugged in, the router light would never come on, and it would never get an IP address from my router. To test this, I plugged in a laptop using that same cable, and it immediately worked without any problems. So I knew that the ethernet port was the problem and not my router (which I have two routers, and tried both of them).So, after speaking with multiple reps at Samsung, I finally spoke to an agent who I believed was going to help me. Myself and the agent went through the same troubleshooting steps, but still unable to resolve the issue. So he asked if I had registered my product to be eligible to have my warranty extended for 3 months. I told him that I had registered, and he looked up that information successfully. I even received an email stating that my warranty had been extended for three months. The agent then proceeded to get a work order so that a technician would contact me to setup service. At this point, I am under the impression that I will be covered under the extended 3-months. (To make a long story short) I received a call from the Samsung technician in my area, and stated that Samsung did not inform him that my tv was under warranty and stated that Samsung would have to send documentation that it is still under warranty. So I contacted Samsung, once again, and I was told that since the unit was out of the first year warranty, I would not be able to have my tv repaired, and that I would be responsible for the service if I decided to have it serviced. I even forwarded the email that I received about my extended 3 months of warranty to the Samsung rep, and was told that they could not honor that warranty, and I would be responsible for the service.I am not here to bash Samsung for the way I was treated. I understand that I was out of my warranty at the time when I started having issues, and I understand that they technically do not have to provide me with anything. I am simply writing this to inform potential buyers of my issues with this television set and how my issues was 'resolved' by Samsung. This is more to inform you about the company, more than it is about this specific product, which if the one i purchased.I reiterate, this product looks fantastic. It has the ability to stream Netflix, Hulu, MLB.TV, Youtube, etc. I even have a few DLNA applications(such as PlayOn, Twonky, and a Windows Home Server with built in Media Server capabilities) and this television played all of my media (videos, music, and photos) that were located on my server and my main computer.But, please be informed that if you begin to have issues, even just a day out of your warranty, you are on your own.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Get ready to be blown away!", "Author": "J.

Sound quality could have been better (its good and clear but not like home theater).2. Playing YouTube etc. is cool but going through provided remote is a real pain (almost impossible) because you have to select letters one by one. There is a Samsung IPhone Remote app but that is also not great (there are some bugs like if you start the app before starting the TV it cannot find the TV until you restart the iPhone. Also YouTube app doesn't support the Samsung Remote App to type and search the video, so you have to use Samsung search feature (which is good)).3. TV supports WIFI but you have to buy Samsung Link Stick wireless LAN adapter (50-60$ more) to make it work over WIFI (it supports Ethernet port too but Netflix works over WiFi only).4. Samsung app store is not mature enough (will take some time I think).5. No web browser.So all in all its a very good, sleek, light weight, stylish TV with very good picture quality but I think 750$ (800$ with adapter) is still very high because you can get same picture quality LCD TVs in 400-500$. So if you care for sleek and light weight (you'll not lift it everyday :)) and name Smart TV buy it, otherwise any other TV should be able to suffice your requirements.Note: I have heard that bigger sizes Samsung smart TVs like 46 and 55 inch doesn't require wireless adapter and they have Qwetry Remote and also web browser.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Research comments", "Author": "R.

However I recently discovered an attribute that I thought others considering the purchase should be aware of. I was planning to use the tv digital optical output to couple the audio output to my home theater receiver and couple my components directly to the tv by HDMI cables without using the tv internal speakers. If you wish to try this approach I found a tech review on the Crutchfield web site that states the tv optical digital output only outputs two channel sound to the home theater receiver from HDMI components connected directly to the tv. The only exception appears to be for off the air tv having 5.1 channel sound. I do not know why the optical output capability would be limited by the manufacturer. This apparently means that you will have to do an optical (or other)output to your home theater receiver directly from the component for any HDMI component connected  directly to your tv if you want 5.1 sound through the receiver. If having to do more cabling is bothersome to you this might be of interest.

Everything worked as it should have, then one day vertical lines suddenly appeared on the screen.  At the time, I believed that it was a mainboard problem because the HDMI ports felt loose.  I should mention that I rarely, if ever, touched the cables.I called Samsung support, and they charged us $60 to send a technician to diagnose the problem.  He took a 30 second look at it and decided it must be the panel, even though I was insistent about the HDMI ports.  I figured that the technician probably knew more than I did so I ended up contacting the repair department to have a new panel installed.  They offered to replace the panel, specifically stating that we wouldn't have to pay anything, part or labor.In came the same technician, who just replaced the panel.  The problem persisted, and he finally came to the realization that the issue lies in the mainboard due to loose HDMI ports.  He then proceeded to charge us $160 for labor.  So now I'm out $220 and still have a broken TV with a mainboard that is NOT covered because Samsung misdiagnosed the problem.  On top of that, getting through to their repair service department on the phone has proven very difficult.You would think that an HDTV costing over $1,500 would last longer than 18 months of moderate use, that Samsung could send someone who could accurately diagnose the problem, and that they would fix it after charging you $220 for repairs.I used to be a fan of Samsung, having bought several product from them, but I can't recommend them anymore.

Unfortunately, the television had a defected computer and it did not have the ability to remember passwords or settings and you entered on the computer which meant we had to type in the passwords manually every time it connected to the internet, netflix, etc (I have other smart tvs and devices that do not have that problem). I called Samsung within a month of the purchase. The level 1 technicians at Samsung were not familiar with the product and they gave you instructions and mentioned applications that are not relevant to the product (they tell you to go to a certain screen or click on something that did not exist on this model). After you carefully explain to them that that option is not there, they are baffled. The level 2 technicians never return your call or pick up the phone (I called 10+ times). I eventually was able to elevate it and scheduled a local service center to stop by the house and view the product (from my phone conversation, he was confident he needed to replace most of the processor on the tv with with a newer product). This was 3 weeks+ later. Right before he placed his order, Samsung canceled the order (of course they did not notify me of the change). I called them up and after several attempts, I was able to get another service center scheduled to come by (they would not let me use the other center for some reason). Unfortunately, after we had it all scheduled out with the second service center (hours before they are suppose to arrive), Samsung decides to cancel the latest ticket. Of course, Samsung did not have the courteous to let you know (the local service center and I were puzzled but he said he couldn't come out since Samsung canceled the ticket). I called back for the 20th + time and then Samsung said they canceled it because they wanted to offer me a new tv instead (I simply wanted the tv to work but based on their track record, I realized Samsung was not able to service it and did not appear to be willing to service it - 3+ weeks and 30+ calls later). I decided to wait to hear what model they would offer. Two days later, they said they would offer the 46D7000 tv (a nice upgrade that is 6 inches larger, has a better contrast ratio and is a 3D tv). For once, I thought Samsung was looking out for their customer (especially, since I had 6 other HDTVs by Samsung). They said they would deliver it within 10 business days. 9 Business days later, I call Samsung for a status update since no on contacted me. They then mentioned the replacement was canceled since they ran out of the 46D7000 tv (of course Samsung did not offer the courteous of calling you to let you know). I asked them what the alternatives were. They then offered 2012 model that costs $500 less and had a fraction of the features (it was not a Smart TV so it could not connect to the internet/netflix and had less than half the inputs, etc). I was angry with this since the entire purpose was the smart tv functions. Finally, they offered a different model (they later reneged on the offer for some reason) which was a smart tv with a closer price range (still cost less) but it had 1/5 the contrast ratio and was missing several ports. Advice: never purchase a Samsung product as this will be my last Samsung purchase. In short their offer changed from the a near top of the line LED product (Samsung 46D7000) to the bottom of the line product in a matter of a week. Fortunately, Amazon offers good customer service and offered me a full return for the TV and the wireless card even after the 4 week return policy expired.TV:Beautiful picture overall. But it has some slight bleeding issues on the corners when the format is not 16:9 (full screen, extra wide screen, etc).  The sound was clear for tv speakers.  Overall, I was very satisfied with the TV itself. It had numerous inputs and outputs for expansion (4 hdmi, 3 USBs, etc).Smart Features:The Smart applications (after you manually typed in the passwords each time you connected) were severely lagged (took 2 minutes to load) and years behind the competitors. It took at least 30 secs to a minute to view the description for a netflix movie (in Roku or blu ray players it happens instantly). If you want a Smart TV (which I do), you definitely need to purchase another brand as Samsung does not offer a Smart TV in the 2011 or 2012 lineup. Alternatively, you can purchase a Roku device which works great with no lag and is the same price as one of Samsung's networking USD cards.It would be a better idea to pay less and get a higher quality product such as a Sony tv.

I've had it on the wall for about two weeks now and have been using it with several different kinds of sources. I have not adjusted anything in it so far, so my comments are based on what content looks like on this set right out of the box.The UN60 is fed from a Tivo HD for both live and recorded TV content. HD broadcast looks really great in both 1080i and 720: very good detail and contrast. Blacks look pretty darn black to me, so the argument about how plasmas do this better seems not to matter. I don't see any LED bleed anywhere. Standard 480 TV seems to vary a bit; sometimes it seems kind of dark, other times not so much. This occurs both with live broadcast and Tivo playback. I don't know what to make of this yet; maybe an adjustment on the set will affect this, but I have not tried yet, or maybe that is just how the broadcasts really look. DVDs and Blu Ray look spectacular on this set; in my opinion they look better than movies in a theater. I do not use the audio in the set, so I can't comment on that.All in all I'm very happy with the UN60D6000.It's last years model, and doesn't have 3D, but does have a great picture, especially in HD.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "buttons & bows", "ReviewID": "R3OFSSAESLGZR4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although a part was missing, Samsung customer service put a rush on the part & I received it in a week as opposed to the customary two weeks.

I own other 40\" samsung tvs and they all lasted over 2 years. They are build to last.  This is no different. I like the material , feel and the size. LED screen is so thin im really impressed.Inputs/Outputs: so many... you cant go wrong. hdmi avi optical. all workMovies: look awesome. 120hz 1080p are great specs. I use my ps3 to watch blue rays and you can see the difference in quality compared to my other older 40\" samsung tvs that also have 120hz.Computer monitor:  I mainly use this for my computer so I have more to say on this. After lots of research this was the best monitor / screen for my computer that was a 32\" . I personally think its the best size because 20\"s are to small and 40\"s are too big. Tried both and 32\" is definitely great screens for all computer uses especially gaming and movies. One thing you got to know about this screen is i went for this one instead of the mid range 32\" that samsung  has because this model has a 5million:1 contrast ratio while the lower models have a much lower contrast ratio.  I have gf460 graphics cards in sli and i ran a hdmi cable to the TV.  IMPORTANT: although the specs says it can run at 1920 resolution, you can run it only at 1650resolution. This happens only when you are in the main windows screen and using programs. if you put the resolution at 1920 its no clear for some reason. probably something they didn't say. BUTTTT in games you can run 1920 resolutions and looks impressive. Ive run battlefield 3 1920 resolutions, Mass Effect 3 1920 and league of legends @ 1650. So while in windows you will have to run at 1650 and in games you have the options to run to max resolution.Samsung Aps : Have not tried / probably wont ever touch. Sorry. If you need internet i see it easier to use your computer. Run a laptop to you tv for netflix. simple as that. Just my 2 cents.Overall I like my purchase and I can see using this for many years to come. it met my usage of computer, games and movies.Rate this A-  : + Great led tv that can be used as a computer monitor and you dont have to spend 1,000+ on a 32\" dell computer monitor  - the Resolution quirks brought it down a little .", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung TV UN46D6000", "Author": "Lee 1", "ReviewID": "R2JVDTM845KMKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality is vary good as well as the sound quality.

It's incredibly thin and amazingly light for the size.  The stand doesn't look like it should support it, but it does.

This particular model has a different panel that most HDTVs. It's basically clear glass rather than a mat finish. The advantage is that blacks are richer and colors pop out better. While there is some reflection it doesn't seem to have much impact on the viewing.  I compared this set to the Panasonic plasma and the LGs in the same size.  There was no comparison.  Plasma was always too dark while the LG sets appeared washed out.  I also wanted the 120hz refresh since we watch lots of football and basketball. There is virtually no motion blur.

Ruslander", "ReviewID": "R15M82KXU1NZ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I read reviews I often find very technical essays on the products that I am interested in. The same was true when I researched this television. Many factors went into my decision and sometimes similar model numbers were difficult to seperate in a particular review of this category of Samsung led tvs. All the reviews that I read for this tv (and going to the store and seeing a floor model in action) contributed to my decision to purchase this model. What I did find out, and this cost a review star, was that my model didn't have the wireless LAN adapter included. This additional item cost about $70. My friend got the Samsung tv that had \"wireless\" built in, cheaper than I got mine. Otherwise our sets were identical. Having said that, the tv is fantastic. The outside styling is contempory without potentially dating itself. The picture is absolutely clear and sharp. I was a bit disappointed in the sound quality, but when setting it on \"Movie\" mode the bass was better and the tinny \"trebley\" quality was corrected. I found that the picture setting \"Natural\" was most desireable as well. This television has all the bells and whistles that you could want for the price. Internet access is limited and using the remote is laborious and a bit confusing when typing in your account settings and password. Facebook is limited in displayed content, but YouTube can be breathtaking when watching HD videos. I hooked up everything to the stereo which was very easy. There is a comprehensive  E-Manual which will walk you through things that you need to know, so expect a bit of a learning curve. Out of the box, the default settings will not disappoint.Another issue that I had was not with the television, but was in fact with the purchase price. The store that shipped the set through Amazon was top rate, prompt and all was good, but they only had a few in stock. When they sold out in a matter of days, (after I received mine), Amazon had another dealer who offered the same set for about $100 cheaper. This wasn't a sale price. It would be nice if Amazon guaranteed a price, so that I would have paid the same price as someone else who bought the same tv through Amazon just a few days later.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still trying to figure out", "Author": "C.

I was surprised to see how nice this television and its stand looked. We do have it hidden away in a cabinet, but it looks so good that really isn't necessary.The setup was fairly easy and when it was done the picture quality looked okay, not spectacular, just okay.  What we did not realize when we bought the set, was that for us to receive HDTV,even on an HDTV set, that we would need a box from our cable company. We got the box and when it was hooked up this is when the picture really became great.  I feel sorry for those people that are on TV now, all of their flaws really stand out.  The picture quality is fantastic.  Unlike some other reviewers, so far we have not noticed any light bleeding from the black screen. We are very pleased with this television set.  So far we have not tried to connect to the net or download movies, so I cannot comment on that.

Don't complain about the quality of television speakers. If you're dropping this kind of cash on a television and don't have or plan to have external speakers also, you're silly. I didn't even bother to listen to the on-board speakers before plugging this into more serious equipment. I'm not even talking about a 5.1 system--2 speakers won't kill you.2. This television has a bonkers amount of ports, namely 4 HDMI and 3 USB.3. Clean the residue left behind on the edging from the clear plastic with the included polishing cloth and water, or dust will stick to it.4. The base lets the screen swivel about 10 to 20 degrees to each side, which is nice because the entire unit is mildly hefty.5. Does not come with a wireless receiver adapter--must be purchased separately! This is how you'll connect it to the Internet/network, unless you happen to have your router or an Ethernet wall socket nearby.6. Don't be afraid to toy with the settings (and boy are there a bunch). I increased the backlighting and sharpness a bit, but turned down the brightness. I'll probably mess with it more in the coming days. A neat feature is that it remembers your settings for each input separately, like if you're also using this as a second computer monitor sometimes.7. I'm loving the picture through HD signal so far. The good stuff comes through extremely crisp.8. Lastly, the 120Hz bit. It's important to note that there is a feature called Auto Motion Plus that can be altered, or even turned off, that can affect the smoothness of motion on screen. I don't know how separate it is from the refresh rate itself, but be aware of it. Motion does look different at first if you've been watching 60Hz all your life like I had, but I've grown to like it. It makes things more visually stimulating, but also smoother. Even HD home movies are cooler.Overall, I am really happy with this television so far.Update: Works great as a secondary display for your computer, although you probably won't be able to get the backlighting and/or colors to match exactly.

That being said, the picture is now stunning and meets my expectations.The only other issue I have is with backlight bleeding. If you're watching anything with a 16:9 ratio you won't notice it, but when you watch a movie with hard matting (black bars) it is very noticable in all four corners of the screen. Its not awful, and generally doesn't affect the picture quality, but its annoying.This is a great product and worth the money, but I would consider looking at other brands/models of LED to see if the bleeding problem is mitigated.Amazon's service was fairly good and the shipping was fast. I did speak to a customer service rep. about the bleeding and he immediately deferred my concern and gave me Samsung's service hotline.

Lockhart", "ReviewID": "R1ACPB4YM4F6CA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv to replace a 20 some year old 26inch tube tv in my mothers bedroom.  First, the picture quality is amazing. The color depth makes the images look amazing.  I just can not say enough about the picture quality. Setup was a snap, I also purchased the Samsung wireless adapter had it plugged in before I powered on the tv. When the setup started answered some questions, got to the network setup, picked my wireless network (it picked up a couple of my neighbors networks) and it joined in seconds. I was prompted to perform a firmware update, took a minute or two, tv rebooted and I was done. Switched source to HDMI 1 and first was like oh no. Awful picture, but remembered I didn't change anything on the ATT Uverse box. Once that was done, picture perfect. Now the one thing I do not like is the sound. I think they could have done a better job with that, so I will come up with a solution so it doesn't sound like a tin can.The smart hub is nice, a little cluttered.  This isn't a 3D tv and default icon it is on is a 3D icon. I am sure I can delete.  Navigating through is a little sluggish.  For the Netflix, the steaming is flawless. One thing I did not mention is my Wireless Router is on the other side of the house, so my speed on average is 6 to 9M a second. Not super fast, but the Netflix playback has been flawless. I also purchased a wireless extender, but haven't set it up and that might be going back.Now one feature I like and dislike.  I also purchased a Sony BDP-S780 BluRay to go with the tv. What is great, when you start the player, the tv automatically switches to the HDMI 2. That's perfect. But when you are done and power off the BluRay, it goes to the source TV instead of the HDMI 1 where the ATT source is. I haven't spent a lot of time playing with it and for me it's not a big deal, but to a 78 year old mom, it gets confusing on what button to press to watch TV again.  I'll dig some more to see what options there are, but that and the sound are my only complaints.Overall, this is a great TV and you will not go wrong with this purchase.

The room is about 18' by 12' and I had originally figured that a 32\" screen would be fine.I ordered the little brother to this Samsung, the UN32D6000, but found it too small. The picture was wonderful but I sent it back. Then I tried the LG37LE5300, as a step up in size. There are no Samsung 37\" screens and I thought they would be very similar between the brands. Boy, how wrong I was. The LG looked good, very slim and elegant. However, that was as good as it got. The screen displayed extreme clouding on black backgrounds and the sound was very weak. Also the navigation seemed complicated. I sent it back and ordered the Samsung UN40D6000.I should have done this first time round. My concern that it would be too big and be dominating in the room was unfounded; it fits in just fine. This tv has a remarkable picture and needed almost no adjustment out of the box.  Blu Ray is amazing and even regular dvd looks better than I have seen on any other tv. The sound quality is what you would expect from such a skinny set, so I added a ZVOX 550 soundbar.

I don't think LCD/LED technology is very reliable, the salesman told me 1 out of the 3 of his Samsung TV's developed a problem and my daughter has a Samsung that has a problem after 2 years.  I expect this brand is about as good as it gets which in my opinion isn't good enough for the prices. That being said I made sure to buy an extended warranty and purchased it from a local store to ensure easier service.EASE OF SETUP - SO/SOPutting this TV together is easier if you've put one together in the past as the instructions and illustrations were low quality.  One of those big instruction sheets that come with some computers and electronics would have been helpful.  The stand and TV went together without too much effort though.  For some reason the electrical plug didn't fit into my existing surge protector, I didn't explore it further but just plugged it into a different one which was fine and probably a better idea.  The connections on the back are very flat which made it hard to screw in my antenna connection.  Everything plugs in so that it is as flat as possible which I'm sure is nice if you're mounting it on the wall. Getting the TV settings the way you like is also easier if you've messed with these TV's before, I got through it with a little trial and error pushing buttons and going through menus.  The setup instructions are almost non existent and I didn't find the onscreen instruction manual answered any of the questions I had.  However all this was fairly simple and in little more than an hour I had it put together, figured out and pretty much set up the way I wanted except for the networked functions which I saved for another day.NETWORKED APPSThe network applications that I've used work great. I don't have a wireless network in my home and it was no problem to plug in an ethernet cable.  I bought a hub but couldn't get the TV connection going with it so instead I've been un-plugging my computer when I want to watch networked shows.  I expect I can fix this somehow in the future.  There seems to be quite a few applications to choose from in addition to Netflix, Hulu and Vudu. Setting up the apps is like loading apps on your phone. I've watched a few things off random free applications in addition to several Netflix movies.  This ability was why I chose this TV and I'm very happy with the ease of use and quality.  Your internet connection and the apps you choose to watch will affect quality of course.IN GENERALThe picture is crisp, better than my Visio was.  It does require some tweaking on settings which my Visio did not, as it was set up very well out of the box. I like the way the remote is laid out. I love the fact that you can get a list of what's playing on each channel, I wasn't expecting that. The picture is good, I'm happy with the settings.  I haven't quite figured out the motion blur control which is supposed to be an option and I've messed with it but still seem to get a slight motion blur occasionally.  I'm very happy with my purchase so far.

The picture is unbelievably clear. The actors seem to pop from the screen in HD as well as old B&W; streaming movies and DVDs.

The Sony didn't last as long as we hoped developing read and green horizontal lines. Terribly disappointed with Sony quality.The Samsung has one small disadvantage. Unlike the LCD, the clear screen and LED does produce glare from lighting. We got used to a \"non-glare\" picture and it's hard to go back to seeing people and lights in the picture.

After reading all the reviews and learning how \"easy\" it was going to be to install this TV, we started with confidence that this project wasn't going to take too long.  Well, today we began and from the time we opened the box to sitting down and watching a program it was at least 3 hours later. My husband lost a few hairs over setting this TV up plus we ended up needing to call our cable company to help us set up that end of it.  Once the cable company told us to remove a label over the HDMI input we inserted the HDMI cable and Voila! the whole landscape changed!  Before that discovery we were struggling with on-screen green people and a buzz that wouldn't go away.  We found the menu on the remote to not be too friendly PLUS in order to learn anything about the TV you had to go to the on-screen E-Manual by pushing the button on the remote!  I want that information in my hands not on the screen or at least have it on line where I can print it out later!  Anyway, we still have to install our Samsung Blu-ray player and hope that it will be a bit easier than the TV was.  Now that we have had our lunch we are now able to add a few positive comments:  beautiful picture, bright with natural skin colors, sound is fine (may add speakers or sound bar later), and picture big enough for viewing 9 feet away and not too big for viewing a bit closer.

I highly recommend it.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture, not so smart", "Author": "vertigo_2_20", "ReviewID": "RM80HG72FX4ZO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV has an excellent picture quality, with extremely deep blacks (a common weakness of LCD/LED TVs) and little to no issues with backlight bleed, at least not noticeable without looking very closely. As with most/all LCD/LED TVs, this one has the issue where motion looks odd, like a home video camera. Some people like this, I personally find it distracting. However, for the most part it's not a big issue, partly due to the fact this TV unlike many others allows for separate adjustment of judder and blur reduction. I also like the fact the TV has DLNA support and a built-in Netflix app, however, as you'll see below, these both have major flaws.Unfortunately, as nice as this TV looks, both physically and the picture, it has far too many big drawbacks for me to give it a good review. The first that came to my attention was that if you use the audio out jack (I'm using a set of Logitech 2.1 speakers with it for compactness, as I'm only at my current residence for a few months, so it's not worth setting up my HT), you can't control the volume through the TV. They could have easily made it linked to the TVs volume, but instead they decided to save $0.50 or whatever, and now I have to adjust it on the speakers themselves. The next issues that appeared were the TV/apps crashing when watching Hulu (and I think the TV itself crashed when on another source, but I don't remember now, though I do know the whole TV actually restarted at at least one point). Also, the TV is just extremely slow: It takes forever once powered on before it's usable, and browsing connected hard drives is borderline agonizing. As if this isn't bad enough, many times when you go to the Smart menu, you have to wait several minutes while it downloads/installs updates for the apps, without asking you, and even if you don't want most of the apps in the first place, which is another issue of its own. When I want to sit down and watch a Netflix movie, I want to do it when I turn the TV on, not 5-10 minutes later after it's done doing what it wants to do. Samsung should have made the option to do this at the user's time of choosing, possibly when the TV is turned off (could turn the screen off and leave the TV on long enough to do what it needs to do, then power off completely).Also, when watching Netflix, it will sometimes stutter excessively, loading every 1-2 seconds, and the other day it was even worse and when it happened my computer, which is connected, started to act like it was having an external display constantly connected and disconnected, which leads me to believe the TV randomly started cycling through inputs \"behind the scenes,\" messing with both the computer and the displaying of the stream. Yet other times when Hulu, being streamed from my computer via PlayOn, hits a commercial the stream will just stop. When these various issues have cropped up, I have started watching it with either my computer, using the TV as a monitor, or with my PS3, and both ways I've never had a problem. This indicates a major issue with their Netflix app and with their software DLNA server compatibility, as it obviously doesn't work terribly well with PlayOn, though probably 85-90% of the time it's fine.Yet another problem I've had with the TV is two or three times I've turned it off, watched the LED light on the TV go solid on, as it does when the TV is off, then watch as the TV turns itself back on, all on its own. That's just unacceptable. Finally, the limited PiP functionality is a real disappointment. I thought I would be able to do things like have it acting like a secondary monitor while watching a TV channel in the corner, or playing a PS3 game on the bottom and watching Hulu on the top. There's no reason these things shouldn't be possible, but they're not. About all you can do with PiP is watch two channels at once on TV.I'm still keeping it, because a lot of the issues didn't really become apparent until past 30 days, and I got an excellent deal on it, but it may be the last Samsung I buy. I have not had good luck with their products, as I have a Galaxy Tab 10.1 that has many software/firmware issues as well; they should stick to displays and not try to make \"computers\" and software. I'm being generous giving this TV 3 stars. At best, I'd say it's worthy of 2.5. Had I paid full price, I would rate it as 2, because I feel for the money it just would not be worth it and would be a huge slap in the face. However, considering the good deal I got on it, it gives me the main thing I want: 46\" of goodness in a small, light form factor. I just hope future offerings by Samsung or others actually take the time to smooth out the edges and realize it's the whole package that matters, and when the software sucks, it doesn't really matter how good the hardware is. Somehow, I don't think Samsung is going to learn that lesson anytime soon, though.Update: I've now owned this TV for 3.5 months, and still have all the same issues. It still occasionally reboots in the middle of what I'm doing and/or starts acting erratically, causing extremely excessive buffering of Hulu/Netflix. It seems to happen after the TV has been on for a while, so it may be an overheating issue. What's strange is that I just switch to using the PS3 and it works fine, so it's not an issue with displaying the picture, just an issue with the network adapter perhaps. My latest issue is that it just now took 4 attempts to launch the Netflix app; each time I tried it would just go to a black screen, and one time it even switched inputs (which it has also been known to do on its own).I realize a lot of these issues may just be my set being a lemon, but in case others are experiencing similar problems, I thought I'd mention them.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "stib", "ReviewID": "RIO6IQAW72ICD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent picture and sound quality on this model TV.

For the most, we liked the TV. Loading the Smart function is slow and the apps are not great, but given the Smart TVs are new, this did not bother us and was not unexpected. Until recently, we would of still given a 5 star rating to both TVs. However, we began having vertical lines on our smaller TV. When I called about getting it serviced (which must be done through Samsung), I was told that because it is a 32 inch TV, I have to mail it in. They will not send technicians to repair a TV under 40 inches, I was told. This is very disappointing. We had this wall mounted. Thus, I have to take it down, remove the mounting, mail the TV to Samsung, reattach the wall mounting when it returns, and hang the TV. It is generally recommended to have a second person to hang a 32-inch TV. I will have to find assistance, again, to hang the TV. Its a pretty good TV when working, but keep in mind that they do not offer good service options if you have a problem. It is important to be an informed consumer and take this into consideration when purchasing any Samsung TV under 40 inches. Personally, I would not consider a Samsung TV under 40 inches based upon the service options. Samsung could and should provide better service. It seems clear that they do not have as strong of a commitment to their TVs under 40 inches. Given this, I will think twice about any purchases from Samsung in the future.

I purchased an LN40C650 just over a year ago. The review is posted on that product on Amazon, and I wanted to share my experiences with Samsung for anyone and everyone to see.)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I want to start off by saying that the Samsung LN40C650 tv set is great. The picture quality is awesome, local and internet streaming work perfectly, and I was extremely satisfied with this unit, until...About a week after my 1 year warranty expired, I began to have problems with the ethernet adapter on the tv. I called Samsung to see what troubleshooting steps I could take to resolve my issue. The problem was that no matter what cable I used or what port on the router was used, the tv could not connect to my network. (Keep in mind that I am a network technician and understand how networks work, and knew exactly what the problem was.) After relaying that same information to multiple agents when calling Samsung, every time I called they wanted me to go through the same troubleshooting steps. I informed them that the problem was with the ethernet adapter on the television. When the tv was plugged in, the router light would never come on, and it would never get an IP address from my router. To test this, I plugged in a laptop using that same cable, and it immediately worked without any problems. So I knew that the ethernet port was the problem and not my router (which I have two routers, and tried both of them).So, after speaking with multiple reps at Samsung, I finally spoke to an agent who I believed was going to help me. Myself and the agent went through the same troubleshooting steps, but still unable to resolve the issue. So he asked if I had registered my product to be eligible to have my warranty extended for 3 months. I told him that I had registered, and he looked up that information successfully. I even received an email stating that my warranty had been extended for three months. The agent then proceeded to get a work order so that a technician would contact me to setup service. At this point, I am under the impression that I will be covered under the extended 3-months. (To make a long story short) I received a call from the Samsung technician in my area, and stated that Samsung did not inform him that my tv was under warranty and stated that Samsung would have to send documentation that it is still under warranty. So I contacted Samsung, once again, and I was told that since the unit was out of the first year warranty, I would not be able to have my tv repaired, and that I would be responsible for the service if I decided to have it serviced. I even forwarded the email that I received about my extended 3 months of warranty to the Samsung rep, and was told that they could not honor that warranty, and I would be responsible for the service.I am not here to bash Samsung for the way I was treated. I understand that I was out of my warranty at the time when I started having issues, and I understand that they technically do not have to provide me with anything. I am simply writing this to inform potential buyers of my issues with this television set and how my issues was 'resolved' by Samsung. This is more to inform you about the company, more than it is about this specific product, which if the one i purchased.I reiterate, this product looks fantastic. It has the ability to stream Netflix, Hulu, MLB.TV, Youtube, etc. I even have a few DLNA applications(such as PlayOn, Twonky, and a Windows Home Server with built in Media Server capabilities) and this television played all of my media (videos, music, and photos) that were located on my server and my main computer.But, please be informed that if you begin to have issues, even just a day out of your warranty, you are on your own.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW, great TV", "Author": "JoeDirt", "ReviewID": "R2F2HEVWAXWB7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took about 10 minutes to attach stand.

I then gave Samsung a call back and they informed me that the part was on back order for the next 1-6 weeks if I ordered the part this way.
