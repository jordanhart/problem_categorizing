{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great LCD TV choice!", "Author": "C. Roemer", "ReviewID": "R114WCJLD19X44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been doing research on a new TV for months.  Choosing the size was the easiest part based on the space I wanted to fill.  Room is very bright, so LCD was the likely choice; although I didn't rule out the new Panasonic plasmas with their anti glare, but they are lacking in picture adjustments.  The Samsungs are all generally too reflective.  I saw the new Sony W5100 and started watching that model.  I was waiting for some reviews to read some opinions, but it was too new.  I had decided to go with the W5100 based on the price, energy efficient, and the fact that I had read that there really wasn't a discernible difference between 120hz and 240hz.  Choosing the sony brand was based on the fact that netflix will be available this fall, and that I have a PS3.  I finally decided on the Z5100 because I saw it in the store and noticed the bezel was nice and thin, and that the tv speakers pointed forward.  Most flat panels' speakers point down, so I figured it would help when watching broadcast tv to have the speakers pointed forward. Not the most 'scientific' method of selection.I am very happy with this TV.  The picture is great, the sound is great, no issues with glare, the internet content works (although I am still waiting for netflix, I did get an Amazon credit for VOD to try out), and the PS3 looks amazing.My suggestion to anyone researching a new tv is to really nail down your requirements first, then choose some models that fit, and finally narrow it down from there based on features.  Then head to a store to really look them over.  I found myself almost getting too caught up in reading reviews.  I found many negative points that, in retrospect, were very nit picky, so don't get too caught up; if you notice, this model only has positives at this point.  I was also comparing energy usage figures on crutchfield.  Most energy tests are based on a minimum of 6-8 hours of usage per day, which I don't do.  If you avoid the Vivid mode and stick to standard or cinema, you will be fine with energy usage.Amazon's price was perfect; I had been watching a handful of tvs for a couple months and monitoring prices.  The delivery was ok.  The package was damaged on one corner, as if a fork lift had punctured it.  The tv has a tiny little nick that is only noticeable if you run your finger ever so slowly along the bezel.  So it wasn't big enough to send it back.If you decide on this tv, you are making a great choice. I haven't calibrated it yet, but may do so when cnet posts some numbers.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV, just like XBR9!", "Author": "N.

We bought this TV because it looked amazing in the stores. I even have a friend that works for Sony and he said that this model is almost an XBR as far as picture. I have seen them side by side and I can't tell the difference, minimal if anything. This Tv has amazing color and picture quality! I have it hooked up to a Sony HT-SS360 surround and a Playstation 3 Blu-ray. Let me tell you that when you are in standard mode, it looks like live action - Amazing! The upscaling of the DVD on the Blu-ray also makes the TV seem even more spectacular.

I could not have picked a better television.  I have a sony blu-ray and a sony surround sound system.  The three of them compliment each other better than I could have ever expected.  The tv in HD is absolutely beautiful.  I see other tvs that are supposed to be comparable, and that just is not the case.  This tv stands alone in this class of televisions.

It is still a very good looking set. When my grandparents wanted a 46 incher for their living room, I researched all the big brands and was leaning toward one of the Sony XBRs. I saw this model for about $200 less than the near equivalent XBR9. According to Sony's TV comparison too (Sony.com), the XBR-9 has Live Color Creation, WCG-CFL backlighting, and 2 additional speakers. From the front, the two sets look pretty much identical. I remembered that this set was for my grandparents, and saved them the $200.They couldn't be more happy with this set. It's big enough to be the center of focus in a 12x15 living room, but elegant enough to fit in with their furniture and decorative tastes. To me, it is amazing what Sony has done in two years. Half the price, thinner, cooler, lighter, better picture (10-bit vs 8-bit), better motion (for sports). etc.If I were shopping for a new primary TV today, I'd look at the 46 or 55 XBR8 because I'm snobby like that. But if you're looking for something that would put shame to the top of the line from just 2 years ago, or you're considering a Vizio from Costco, your money can't find a better value than the 46Z5100. At this price point, the difference between Vizio purchased from your local store and this Sony purchased from Amazon (or Amazon merchant) is like the difference between your old tube TV and that Vizio.

IF You Get The Right Manufacture Date", "Author": "Tiny Tim", "ReviewID": "R2AO5IYKJVQ5G4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Go for the Sony BRAVIA XBR Series KDL-46XBR9 46-Inch 1080p 240Hz LCD HDTV, Black - I wish I would have.  The price difference is negligible  now compared to when I purchased my 46Z.  With the XBR9 you get better built in sound,  better backlight technology, and the speakers are hidden - taking an inch of the height of the bezel/TV.  Not to mention you might be less likely to get the flashlight effect and uneven backlight that I did.Luckily in this case I didn't purchase from Amazon; (1) I had a special deal and (2)having to return 2 units to - you know who: 'blue' - was a hassle but getting three shipped from Amazon would have been more frustrating.So here is my review for the 46\" Z - the third one I tried.The Bravia LCD TV Z series are far superior to others in similar class and price range.  Sony has provided some fantastic features in this model; in fact, most of the specs are identical to the XBR9s!With the Bravia Engine 3 processor and Motionflow 240Hz refresh rate, fast panning and action scenes are rendered smooth and clean.  The exceptional contrast ratio and real time enhancer provide detail in the darkest shadows and deep blacks that rival plasma screens.  Coupled with the ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the contrast and brightness levels to deliver a great picture in any lighting.The award-winning XROSS media bar is the easiest, most user-friendly menu navigation available on any TV.  For a unit with so many features the XROSS is essential for finding content and configurations with ease.  If you have ever used a PS3, the Bravia menus will be very familiar to you, If not, you needn't worry about navigating the TVs functions as XROSS is very intuitive and easy to master.Sony's Bravia link makes one button viewing a reality (when using compatible Sony components); want to watch a DVD or Blu-Ray?  Just insert the disc in a Sony player and the TV as well as A/V receiver will power on, tune to the correct input,  and adjust the audio and screen settings for optimal movie viewing.The included remote will automatically and seamlessly control all of your Bravia Link devices (Blu-Ray, DVD, Home theater surround, PS3, HD radio, and A/V receiver)The Bravia's ethernet port is your doorway to unlimited entertainment and painless firmware updates.  Provided with the Sony W, Z and XBR series is access to free and subscription based streaming content not available on other TVs.-Free, [...] streaming radio without interruptions.-Exclusive free Sony content including trailers, videos and music - currently featuring a collection of full length, high quality, classic music videos by Michael Jackson.-Amazon video on demand service in HD.  IMO much better than pay-per-view.-Netflix streaming HD video- although doesn't currently support  search and is limited to your \"watch Instantly\" queue.-Youtube, eHow.com, epicurious.com, and several other built in widgets to access online content and rss feeds.I have always been a Sony devotee, so I am a bit biased and stuck with this model (2 exchanges to get a defect free screen) when most buyers would have changed brands.I must admit that I was rather particular in my expectations for the video quality.  Most people would not even notice what I called defects in this model - I am a photographer and graphic designer so I have a trained eye for visual appearance and very picky about how a display performs.  The actual problem that I encountered has been documented in several Sony and Samsung models but is common to all LCD screens as far as I can tell.I spent a lot of time and energy unpacking, mounting, configuring, tweaking, contacting Sony support and ultimately repackaging 2 units for return/exchange.  I guess the adage, third times' a charm applied in my case.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "What a beautiful, natural picture!", "Author": "Tom Terrific \"TCW\"", "ReviewID": "R1FE0Q3OFB3X5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many of you, I've pondered over the question of how much should I spend on an HDTV, what manufacturer, what options do I need. Well, let me tell you, this HDTV has the most beautiful, natural looking picture of any television I have viewed at asundry electronics stores. The matt screen does not reflect nearly as bad as the Samsung gloss screens (my neighbor has one and is envious). I got what I consider a great price and a great deal (a free Sony BDVE500W 5.1-Channel High-Definition Blu-ray Disc Player/DVD Disc Home theater System) from Amazon. This is my #1 store for Christmas and throughout the year. Also from my neighbor, \"your sound is so much clearer than on my Samsung - which are back-firing speakers. I'm a senior citizen and lifting the TV by myself is out of the question, so have someone big and husky around (the people that brought it set up the remote and everything for me). The TV is thinner than most HDTV's, with the exception of the new LED TV's.  It has a beautiful piano black bezel and heavy-duty (but non-rotating) base stand (okay, that's one thing my neighbor's Samsung has over the Sony)! If you don't like the factory picture you have plenty of things you can change regarding color, background, blacks, etc. Be sure to buy 3 HDMI cables if you plan to run your TV through a stereo amp (that is capable of HDMI), Cable box (the cable people only supply a component cable connection), and to the TV.

We did a lot of research before we bought this TV.  We paid a few hundred dollars more for 240 Hz even though most reviews say its not worth it.  Its worth it.  We have a 52\" Samsung 120 Hz and we have shadowing; not so with this Sony.  Two other things we like.  The user interface is surprisingly simple to use with a lot of connections and interfaces that are automatically done by the TV.  At first it seems complicated and overwhelming, but after you work with it you see how well designed it is.  The other thing we were surprised at was the quality of the sound from the TV speakers.

Jenkinson", "ReviewID": "R160NJZNEKU2JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received the TV a few days ago, mounted it, and WOW!  Shopping for an LCD in this price range was difficult because there seem to be so many good choices and everybody (like me) tends to leave 5-star reviews because without having these TVs side-by-side how am I supposed to judge?  The lighting and placement at Big Box stores doesn't help.  I am very glad I came across this Sony unit; I get the 240Hz, lots of great internet streaming options, a fabulous picture, and it's not super glossy like the Samsungs.Was worried at first because the Sony logo on the front of the unit lights up quite bright and stays lit while watching show/movies.  Found it quite annoying but then I played around in the options and figured out how to turn it off.  (Settings > Preferences > Front Panel Illumination)Speakers: As far as TV speakers go I thought they sounded good during my test before hooking up to my receiver.  While the unit has the speakers facing the front of the unit they seem to blend with the casing once I step a few feet back (and if you're sitting THAT close to actually notice the speakers then you have bigger problems).  Don't let this front speaker thing be a red herring in your purchase decision; such a non-issue!I selected the Standard shipping when checking out, and I made sure I was buying directly from Amazon.  However, I didn't get the \"white glove\" service other reviewers have commented about (was there something I missed?).  The delivery guy was reluctant to unpack and test the unit since it wasn't spelled out on his \"paperwork.\"  I simply told him flat out that I wasn't signing anything until I see that the unit was in perfect condition.  He rolled his eyes and helped me unpack the unit where we verified that the picture was flawless.

The unit comes packaged well from Sony and the pedestal is easily installed on the bottom of the unit.  This TV is much lighter than the XBR4 and I was able to tackle assembly by myself.  It was so easy to set this TV up and I hooked it up to an Onkyo Surround Sound system and Sony Blu-Ray BDP-N460 (this is the unit that lets you connect to the internet through your LAN) player.  Within minutes I was up and running with NetFlix watching a movie.  The color on this TV is fantastic.  I watched a few games to see the difference that 240Hz makes - and it makes a huge difference and you can also change the settings on the TV.  Everything is crystal clear and super sharp and there is no blurring that I could notice on fast moving images!  There are plenty of jacks on this unit including the nice feature of a LAN Ethernet connection.  This is nice if you don't have the capabilities of hooking up to the internet through a Blu-Ray player that has the network features.  As part of the setup on the TV you are asked if you want to connect to the home network.There is a firmware download available for this TV from the Sony website.  You can download the 30MB file to your computer and copy it on a USB flashdrive.  Although I didn't see any reason to do the firmware upgrade I decided to do it anyway.  I downloaded the file from the Sony support site on the Internet and then copied the file to a Sony MicroVault USB flash drive and then popped it in the back of the TV.  Almost immediately, the TV recognized the file and provided step by step instructions for the upgrade.  It took a total of about 3 minutes to load the file and the TV went on and off about three times with warning screens not to be concerned about the turning on and off.  After that, the TV stated the upgrade was done and I was back to watching a great picture.  I was told that Sony will also send you the firmware upgrade on a USB device if you don't have a USB drive.The remote was larger than I expected and has every button imaginable on it.  It has a lighted feature which I thought was great so you could see the buttons in dim light.  Because the TV is large, if you intend on using the pedestal with the TV, it is recommended that you secure the TV to the stand or wall.  I put straps around the base to secure it to the stand that supports the weight of the TV so that children don't accidentally tip the TV over.  I bought a set of straps (Velcro with Buckle) at Home Depot for about $5 which I used on another LCD TV with great results.  In fact, they worked great and better than some other products advertised over the Internet.  They secured the TV firmly in place to avoid any tip overs.The TV looks great in the gloss piano black and is slimmer than the older model Sony LCD TV's.  I hope to have the TV for a long time.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "After long search I settled for this. What a Great LCD", "Author": "J.

I only went with 4 stars b/c I've had Sony firmware revisions for TV that would randomly reboot the TV while in use.  This is really more a reflection on Sony as a whole an not this particular model.  I've hears/read of others doing the same.  Over all the picture quality is fantastic.  I have yet to see any blurring effects so far (owend for approx 5 months now) and this Z line is mainly the same guts as Sony's top of the line XBRs.

Rogers", "ReviewID": "R3IKA8SZYVJA9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had thought that TVs weren't much different from one to the next, primarily because of the reviews on Amazon.  Everybody seems to think just about every flat screen is awesome.  But this TV convinced me there are significant differences.I hear constant arguments about what makes a difference to the viewer.  You can read the forum debates until you are blue in the face.  But what it comes down to is how the product performs for you, and this product truly shocked me.The only thing I didn't appreciate is that ads imply it is wireless, and it is only wireless if you buy a wireless adapter.  Sony does this with some of their stereo setups as well, saying they are wireless, but after you buy them you find out you have to buy an expensive addition to make them wireless.Now, for the review, which is rather simplistic.  Honestly.  like most people, I bought a TV to watch, and I want to feel as though it is a great TV because I have to live with it for years to come.I bought a Sharp 46\" first after I read some great comments on it and there was a door buster deal at Walmart on the TV.  I got it for $698.  We used it for about two weeks, and I was constantly disappointed with it.  Certain aspects of the picture were distracting.  A graininess in the background, a blurriness when overlays occurred (like when they flash the station's logo on the screen), and an inability to deal with panning effectively, resulting in a jumpy image.I would have kept the Sharp, but I got a deal on this TV at Amazon that was quite good.  So I bought it, thinking if I didn't like it as much as the Sharp, I could find someone that wanted it.  I was blown away.  The design is way more beautiful than the Sharp and the picture is shockingly brilliant.  Side by side, there is just no comparison. The graininess is only present in large black areas, something inherent to LCD, but there is no blurriness, and panning is perfect.  Perhaps that is the quality of the display, perhaps the 240 Hz refresh rate or possibly Sony's algorithm to smooth the picture.  All I know is the effect is vastly more pleasant to watch.The remote is large and plays well with other Sony products.  If you have other Sony components, the TV recognizes them which is kind of cool.  It is internet capable, providing Netflix and other internet TV features that make it a cut above most other TVs.The menus are nicely designed and intuitive.  Setup is simple, except perhaps finding some well hidden connectors on the side of the TV. It also has an integrated TV Guide.  That is also way cool for TV viewing directly from an HDTV Antenna.My only complaint so far, and I am hoping I find a good solution, is that when it is hooked up to my computer, some stray colors appear. For example, black text can have red mixed in or sometimes blue.  This only seems to happen with blacks and was not noticeable at all on the Sharp.  I am hoping this is just a driver issue in Windows, because it is using the generic monitor driver.But honestly, I knew we were hooked on this TV when we realized we were just staring at the commercials rather than fast forwarding past them.  The picture is absolutely hypnotic.This is a brilliant TV and if it is in your price range, you will never regret buying it, at least based on what I have observed.

Very easy to use and setup.Features on this TV are extensive but not exhaustive. The Nextflix and Amazon steaming are great but you can't edit the que from the TV.  There are plenty of other added features that are nice as well.  However, loading times are long on this model (not a fault of internet speed, steaming is HQ and smooth). The type of files you can send to this TV from your computer or USB are limited.  Customer service said it would handle only MP3s and MPEGs. I tried experimenting with ACC, Flack, Vob, WMV, and Quicktime files with no luck.Sound is pretty decent for standard speakers. Midrange is well pronounced making voices easy to hear, but treble and bass are diminished. Off-axis listening is less then desirable making listening in he next room hard.Picture Quaility is very, very good. The best of witnessed under $2k right now.  The 10bit color adds and extra pop to all images. Obviously it really shows on blu-ray but I think it makes all shows a little better. Further on that matter, this TV handles SD broadcasts very well. The TVs lighting is well balanced but it definitely falls short on decent blacks when you're watching HD. When I say this I am compairing it to all TVs but for fluorescent LCDs it's pretty darn good. One thing in particular with this model I noticed is that the corners are sometimes washed out when high backlighting is used. I think this must be how the tubes are arranged.Glare is not as pronounced as i would have thought with the glossy screen. Off-angle viewing is excellent. I have a desk parked perpendicular to the screen and I can turn my head and see everything very clearly. I mean it's not as sharp but it's hard to notice a difference on TV broadcasts.  Nothing I would complain about.Overall, highly recomended. In my opinion, this is the best TV in this price range. A full array of LEDs is the only way this TV could be better.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Set !", "Author": "GLENN LEVY \"lover of fun\"", "ReviewID": "R2KYDVHKJZS2J4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been eyeing this set for about a year, now was the right time to pull the trigger. The price is about as low as its going to get before this set disappears. I decided to buy it locally after studying all the options, I wanted it delivered without hassle and in home 4 year extended warranty just in case. I got the lowest price online matched at a great store here in IL. Worth paying tax for the peace of mind. I also got a free Blu Ray player with it. I think if you have the option of buying a set locally you should with item like a large TV no offense to anyone who bought online. I almost did. I love Amazom.Now on to the TV itself, what a great set the picture quality is amazing, with so many options you can get dizzy playing with them all. I just can't say enough how good this set looks. This is my first LCD TV. I had a 34 inch XBR HDTV tube what a huge difference. This set has every option besides WiFi. The remote is easy to use and very responsive. It controls my DVR, AVR, Blu Ray player. It has codes for just about all the brands of equipment you might have in your home theater. It lights up a nice shade of blue if you are in the dark at a push of button. I found that it handles Standard def TV ok, not as bad as some have said, but certainly not wonderfully. I won't be watching too much standard def after viewing high def. It's just hard to go back, it was already that way the last few years on my 34 XBR as it is. I found the off angle viewing better than expected, but like any LCD once you hit the 45 degree or more angle the color starts to shift and fade. still not nearly as bad as it used to be. I found this set not as bad as the Sammies for off angle. I have a desk about 35 to 40 degrees off angle which I like to sit at and watch and it looks very good.I have the TV hooked up to a Comcast HD DVR, Sony Blu Ray player, and Yamaha home theater receiver. Plus I have xbox 360, PS3, and Wii all hooked up. This set is great for gaming. Each input on each unit is set up and the tv remembers all the settings for each item. I have not had any problems with slow down or artifacing once I tweaked each input for the specific system. This TV handles everything I can throw at it. Even the Wii looks good with ED def with component cables. I am very happy with this TV so far, I have owned it a few days granted, So I will revisit this review in a few months with an update.In closing I would say now is the time to buy this TV, great price at this point. I looked at many other TVs I did not like as much, Edgelit LED, not as uniform a picture with other problems. Plasma too heavy, not as long a life span, worries about burn in and image retention with so many video games that I own. I looked at other brands, Samsung so many complaints with reliablity, and poor customer service, inputs that just die after a few weeks. Sony just seemed to be the overall leader for less problems, reliability. LCD was the best choice for me. The whole clouding issue with LCD is not an issue for me, I just don't see it that much. If you have a chance to buy this set, at this price point IE sub $1500. Grab it up now, I would say bigger is better in this case, so if you have the extra money to go for the 52 version go for it. 46' is still a nice size for an avg room. I just was at my limit for spending. Great set!

The picture quality is great right out of the box and even better after some adjustments.  The low profile design, while not quite as slim as the newest offerings from Samsung, is still very slim without paying a huge premium.  This TV has a bigger screen than my previous 42\" Panasonic plasma but actually feels smaller in the room.  The TV works well with my other Bravia components.CONS: This TV didn't get 5 stars mainly for nitpicky reasons.  First, while the Amazon VOD feature is great, I don't really see the point of the sluggish widgets.  I'm not really sure that the online features are worth the price premium.  The TV's sound, while OK, is not great.  There is only one HDMI jack on the back, the rest are on the side.  While this is convenient, it can be ugly.  Finally, this TV will not allow the Sony Soundbars to mount on the stand.  Soundbars will mount to the W Series and XBR Series but not Z Series.Overall though, despite these minor flaws, I highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia 46\" TV", "Author": "M.

We went with Vann's. The TV arrived several days ahead of schedule (Vann's did their part) but we ended up having to wait an additional day for delivery because the Fed Ex driver obviously did not want to deliver this big, bulky box on a wet, extremely windy, stormy day. I waited home all day the day the TV was to be delivered because of the signature requirement for the delivery, only to find at the very end of the day that the driver had arrived at 8:30 that morning, had failed to ring the front door bell and had instead gone to a garage side door (with no bell) and left an attempted delivery notice which proceeded to blow off the door and fortunately land on the porch and stick in the wet snowy slush. If you could see our house you would understand that this choice was an obvious choice to avoid delivery (down a steep driveway and off to the side of the garage when the driver easily could have walked from his truck staight to the front door). I called to reschedule delivery for the next day but was unable to do so because the postage they use with the \"free shipping\" does not allow you to schedule a delivery time. The following day thinking that they would deliver around the same time of day I was prepared for them in the early AM with a note on the side entrance instucting them to use the front door and to please ring the bell. I again waited the entire day, the TV finally arrived at the very end of the day. Upon arrival, the box was in bad shape, very dirty, torn and water damaged. My heart sank but upon opening the box I discovered that there was a box within a box and the original packing box was in perfect condition! Yeah!I wasted two work days waiting for the \"free shipment\" so my advise would be to pay the shipping cost for an upgrade so that you can schedule your shipment delivery time unless you or someone else is home anyway.  My lost time was worth much more than the added cost of shipping. Another thing they don't tell you is that Fed Ex and UPS are not supposed to allow you to open a package until you have signed for it.  You are told to inspect the package BEFORE you sign, checking for obvious damage and to refuse the shipment if you feel that it is damaged. I got a good driver who bent the rules for me because the box was in such poor condition but you can't count on getting one of the \"nice\" guys. If I had refused delivery based on the exterior condition of the box, I would have sent back a perfectly good TV and I would have been without my new set for a much longer period of time.That all having been said, we LOVE the TV!  It was a great choice. We were planning to buy a sound system for it but feel that we do not need it. The sound is great. We've been watching the Winter Olympics this week and I have to say, this TV is the next best thing to being in Vancouver! And..we're much warmer!We were worried that the 46\" size would be too large for our very small cozy den but decided to go with it anyway because everyone told us \"bigger is better.\"  Absolutely correct!  Because it is so thin, it actually takes up much less space in the room than our older model Sony 27\" TV did.  The room looks larger and roomier! And we have our own personal movie theater. The colors are vibrant and great, the blacks are good and there is no blurring.We hooked it up ourselves (just us girls) using a Mediabridge Ultra Series HDMI cable that we also ordered from Amazon for $10.00. Much cheaper than the $100.00 Monster cable that we originally purchased and returned to Best Buy. The hookup was simple and the picture is great!We definitely recommend this TV!

It is nice for his big room, but I don't like the high gloss on the Samsung. Beautiful picture of course. He paid three thousand for it and I paid one thousand three hundred something for our Sony Bravia. Budget wise the Sony Bravia Z series is a perfect price. I will wait for the LED to go down.
