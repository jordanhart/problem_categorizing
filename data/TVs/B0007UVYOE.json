{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice LCD TV, but hurry because it is discontinued", "Author": "PGMS \"PGMS\"", "ReviewID": "RVPLH1QPOTI6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You can get these sets for well under $400 right now as stores work off their stock. The picture is very good and the sound is excellent for this kind of TV. Unlike the large screen LCD, plasma and rear projection DLP/LCOS/LCD world, waiting for the latest update is not going to buy you a whole lot. If you can get your hand on one of these before they are gone, go for it! If you wait, you are going to be spending around $500 for a good 15-inch Sharp LCD.", "Date": "June 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "kris \"kris\"", "ReviewID": "R31UM9SFP7LDVO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this tv for the past 3 months in my bedroom and it is great. It is a good looking tv and almost all of the wires connecting to cable, dvd player, etc are hidden. My only complaint is that the buttons on the remote are a tad small and not raised enough that is why i am rating it a 4.5. Other then that it is a great tv and i am considering purchasing another one for my study.", "Date": "March 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "So far - no problems", "Author": "C.
