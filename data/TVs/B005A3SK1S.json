I just got one of these after the shop rep (not Amazon) insisted it was a dynamic LED array system.  Not so.

And the Westinghouse web site freely admits that all its \"LED\" screens are of the more economical edge illuminated type.  I really wanted the most current technology, even if I had to pay more or buy a smaller screen, so its going back.

I didn't spend a ton of $$ for a smart TV with cutting edge technology and top of the line features.  I just wanted a beater TV that was still better than the one (older CRT) I had before, without breaking the bank.  It also didn't have sharp corners the way several other flat panels do have - important for handling/moving purposes and for having kids around.  This TV also did not have it's name light up on the frame that many other TV's have which distract from viewing whatever's on the screen.
