Who wants to spend $150 for a tuner with HDMI when this TV is $300? I liked the idea of the lighter weight and possible longer life of the LED backlight.

Boyer", "ReviewID": "R2IXF0TGYU21UX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For $300, this is a good tv. If you have to pay over $340 for it I would look elsewhere. I was nervous about my purchase because while waiting for it to arrive, numerous reviews had been added that were not very favorable. When I hooked up the television and turned it on for the first time, I was disappointed. The television is very blurry and subpar when not connected to an HD source. When I did connect it to my PS3(HDMI) and computer though, it was much better. It has a very crisp display, and with some adjusting to the picture settings (fyi, there are two different menus on the tv for adjusting these settings, one has a lot more options. Make sure you go to the right menu), it gets even better. I bought it planning to use it for a homemade racing simulator, in which the television would only be less than 3ft away from me. I can easily say that it still appears extremely crisp and clear. I'm confused about other reviews that claim they can see the pixels when viewing from a close distance, when I am viewing the tv from an extremely close distance and don't notice any. It does have a really clear picture in HD. I'd rate the picture - HD = 4.5 out of 5, SD = 2 out of 5.  Something I can easily agree with other reviewers on is how bad the sound is. If you check the LG website you can see the specs for the audio are terrible. The speakers are only 5 watts each, and they are on the back of the tv facing away from you... They can get loud though, that is not the issue. The issue is that they sound completely horrible. There is literally no bass in any way, and the midrange and treble sound distant, and they echo. It really is as bad as you can imagine. Only get this television if you are hooking up some sort of speaker system to it, or you don't care in any way about sound quality. I have a cheap 5.1 surround sound system hooked up to it and it works great. Something to note also, the tv does NOT have any typical RCA Audio outs (red & white) on the back, it only has a Digital Optical Out for audio. Just an FYI. I'd rate the sound quality a 1 out of 5.  Something that didn't matter to me, but is a nice touch, is that the tv is extremely light (14.4 lbs), and extremely thin. If those are features you are looking for, this television definitely has them.  I gave this tv a 4 out of 5, because it does everything I expected it to do. I had already planned on having it hooked up to an HD source at all times, and I had also planned on always having a surround sound system hooked up to it. This 32\" LG LED for $300 is a good deal, if you understand what you're buying it for, and how you will be using it. I hope this review helps your decision in some way.

After doing A LOT of research on several sites, we decided to go with this model.Once we set the TV up, we were appalled by the quality of the audio. As some others have said, our clock radios (both at least 10 yrs old and bought quite cheaply...$10-$15) honestly have better sound than this TV did. After watching for about 5 minutes, you got used to the sound, but after FF through some commercials and hearing it again after silence, it was awful. Knowing how much it would cost just to make this acceptable, we chose to return it.We were aware that these TVs are made with the expectation that the consumer will likely hook it up to some amazing surround sound speaker system and such, and maybe someday we will. But right now, the sound on a TV we spend any kind of money on needs to meet at least basic TV watching audio needs. We are pretty easy-going and are not \"audio-philes,\" as I've heard them called, but the audio on this model was simply unacceptable to us. And given our low expectations and needs, that's really pretty frightening.We ended up buying another LG, a different model, at a store where we could judge sound prior to purchase for ourselves.

(Me included!). I see lots of reviews saying people buy soundbars and then cant hook them up to their TV without buying new cables etc.... And one of the negatives on this TV is the sound quality, its not that it is \"bad\" sound, it is just a flat TV that doesn't have \"great\" sound. Sometimes I find i need to crank the sound waaaaay up and its still not that loud. I went to Best Buy as was told i needed a soundbar and that PC speakers would need an expensive adapter... . My room is small and soundbars are expensive, so i was just going to deal with the less than perfect sound. But i tried my PC speakers on a whim yesterday, and they worked fine! You will want to buy quality PC speakers, but that is way cheaper than a good soundbar. And the volume control on the TV worked on the speakers (if i turned them up on the speakers themselves, and went down to 0 (zero) on the TV the sound was still fairly loud out of the speakers, so it doesn't go to zero unless your speakers are way down (so it may not be PERFECT). But the fact that it does work in the optical out plug, and that the remote defaults to raising and lowering the sound is something i do not think all of these new TVs do?

I don't think so.", "Author": "Buffy", "ReviewID": "R3JI0GMF784Y4Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Like several others, I purchased this TV on the 2011 Black Friday weekend for $300. I looked all weekend, trying to find a nice TV for a decent price. I had decided between either an LG or a Samsung. Now I'm thinking maybe I should have went with a Samsung. At the time I bought this TV, it had all good reviews. Not one complaint. I checked the reviews for it on Best Buy's website, too, and again, they were all good. It looked to me like a good deal. I had checked out LGs before and have never seen one for this cheap! But ever since the TV was delivered, I've felt nothing but disappointment.First of all, I knew the TV wasn't going to be crystal clear in SD. It's an HDTV, after all. But when I turned the TV on, the picture was grainy and blurry, and the colors were dull and flat. It was hard to even read the writing on my DirecTV menu! My old Sanyo TV, which is a very old and much smaller flat screen, made back when they first started making them, looks better than this brand new LG I just pulled out of the box. Yes, I was completely let down. But I told myself, I'd mess with the settings and adjust the picture, and see if maybe that could fix it. It didn't. I've had the TV for three days now. I've adjusted it several times since then. It's a little more clear (if watching from a distance) but I can't get the colors to look bright or even normal, for that matter. The white on this TV set is an off white. And the yellow looks almost as if it has some green in it sometimes. No amount of adjusting is making a solid difference. What's also frustrating with this set is that if you want the picture to look at least somewhat decent, you have to watch it from a far. I have a computer chair, which is placed in the left corner, below where the TV is sitting, and when I try to watch the TV from this chair, the picture becomes dull and hazy. I know someone mentioned in another review that it can be viewed from any angle, but I don't believe that to be true. Not from my experience with the TV. I do, however, have the TV set up high. Even so, if it can be viewed from any angle, the height shouldn't matter, and it totally does.Now a lot of people have mentioned the speakers. This is one thing that I don't have a problem with. Maybe I'm just not picky with the sound or maybe my old TV didn't have quality speakers. Either way, the sound doesn't bother me. The TV can get pretty loud, in my opinion. It sounds fine to me. It might be a little off when it comes to the bass, but I don't have a problem with that. My main problem is the picture.After I figured out I couldn't adjust the picture to look as bright as it's advertised to be, I decided to hook my PS3 up to the set and see if that made a difference. It did. The picture isn't quite as nice as my big screen Plasma TV in the living room, but it does look much better in HD than it does SD. Granted, I only played my PS3 on it that once. And this doesn't change the angle problem. HD or SD it still looks hazy and dull when viewed from the bottom left corner. And the colors still aren't overly bright. But it is much more crisp in HD.A few more things I think I should mention. The TV is slow to turn on. It doesn't instantly come on. Takes about five seconds, maybe a little more. I'm also not able to program my DirecTV remote to it completely. Volume and input works, but for some reason, my remote won't turn the TV off. Because of this, I have a second remote I have to use. One nice thing about the TV, that I don't think anyone has mentioned, however, is that it has a very easy to move swivel. You can turn the TV to the left or the right, depending on how you want to view it, without a problem. It is also very thin, but that, I believe, has already been mentioned.After all of this, I decided to give the TV 3 stars. I think maybe if you planned to watch the TV completely in HD, that it probably wouldn't be that bad of a TV. There is the angle problem, and a lot of people aren't satisfied with the speakers, but it at least does look clear in HD. But for someone like me, that will be watching it in SD, too, this TV does not perform well. I'm not happy with how it was advertised to have bright, vibrant colors and instead the colors are dull and off. Again, I know this is an HDTV, but it shouldn't look THIS bad in SD. I watch SD on my Plasma television and the two pictures aren't even comparable. It blows this TV out of the water. Because of this, I'm probably going to be returning the TV and maybe looking into a Samsung this time.**- 8 months later...I'm coming back to say, I actually kept the TV. I planned to return it but I didn't get around to doing it in time. I decided to edit my review because I wanted to let people know, the picture did clear up. It was insanely grainy at first but after watching it for over a week, it started to clear. I don't know what the cause for this was but that did make me a little happier about my purchase. The rest of what I said still stands, though. There is the angle problem, and the picture isn't exactly vibrant, nor bright. Someone actually commented on the darkness of it once. But I recently upgraded to HD channels with DirecTV, and my watching experience has greatly improved.- Just came back again to say my DirecTV remote works with the TV now. I dunno if it's because of the new HD box we got or what. The only thing it doesn't control on the TV is the input. It turns it on/off and changes the volume without problems.

I got it for a great price during a Black Friday sale in 2011 and I was pumped because it was a much better brand than the others offered during those sales.  I should have returned it right when I got it because it had a bright spot in the upper right hand corner.  But since I had no other TV in the house to use, I ignored it since it wasn't noticeable once the screen was turned on.As stated, the sound is completely terrible.  Again, I put up with this since I'm in a small apartment and could deal with it, but I was not happy to need to turn it up to 100 to hear the quiet dialogue in a movie... then as soon as the music/sound effects kicked in, it would blow my eardrums out.The last straw was recently I have been getting a dim spot on the screen after the TV warms up.  It stretches almost all the way down the screen and really interferes with the picture.  I'm fairly certain neither LG or the company I bought it from will do anything for me since more than a year has passed (actually this started DAYS after the 1-year mark), so I have a feeling I need to junk it and start over.Do not recommend this product as it will not last.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELENTE", "Author": "Eduardo Paniagua", "ReviewID": "R3VPOMYDH9TZQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UNA MUY BUENA PANTALLA, LA DEFINICION ES MUY BUENA, LA RECEPCION A INTERNET TRABAJA MUY BIEN Y ES MUY FACIL DE MANIPULAR.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "5 stars", "Author": "alexander", "ReviewID": "RCASKLA03Z025", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent product and very useful .. 100% recommended for those looking for a good product and the best is the good price", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for a good price, but the older model was better", "Author": "Serdar Soysal", "ReviewID": "R2O00C01VIGADG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this one when I needed a second TV because I had purchased a 32\" LG LED TV before and I had loved it.

Connection over HDMI went without a hitch and everything was running perfectly in minutes.  The image is crisp and clear, and generally no complaints about the TV.The problem I have is that compared to the previous iteration, this one seems a little flimsy.  The base connection is smaller than the previous one and it's mostly plastic with no metal support which the previous one had.  With the relatively moderate size of this TV though I don't think it would be a problem.  It makes the whole unit much lighter which is a plus.The other complaint I have is the remote.  Again, compared to the previous version this one looks very cheap, reminiscent of the cheap remotes you'd get on $29.99 DVD players you get at wal-mart.  The previous one had a more stylish remote that was made of better plastics.Overall, it's a good TV for the price and functionally I recommend it.

The screen is only a little over an inch thick, making it ideal for wall mounting or positioning on a shelf using the included stand.  The picture is sharp and vibrant, even with 720p and 60 Hz, mostly because that the smaller screen (relatively speaking) doesn't need the kind of resolution that a larger one does.  As others have noted, the audio is lousy, but you can improve that by connecting a sound bar such as VIZIO VSB200 Universal HD Sound Bar or Mint SB10-SBA1 1.1-Inch Thick Wall Mountable Soundbar) -- but these obviously add to the base cost.The set has the usual basic functions, although most, including the sleep timer, require you to go through the menu to access.  It has two HDMI jacks, a digital optical output, AV/Composite, USB, RGB connection (for a PC), and an antenna/cable jack.  The remote is no-frills; it does not have a decimal point key for exact subchannels, although, once the TV is tuned automatically, it will display a menu of the subchannels from which you can choose. For instance, if you enter 109, it will display 109, 109.1, 109.2, etc. - whatever your cable or satellite offers.This set looks more expensive than it is with its slim profile and glossy black frame.  The included stand swivels, a nice touch for a budget set.  To me, this is the perfect secondary set for a bedroom, guest room, or game room. If you want to use this as your main set, I highly recommend hooking it up with better speakers, either through a sound bar or a receiver with satellite speakers.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for the price - I liked it", "Author": "Kumar", "ReviewID": "R2EEJM4EDS6PE4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i was looking for a good deal in 32\" category.. finally i ended up by taking this on amazon for good price.I am very happy with the performance.Pros: Good Picture clarity, SLIM design, Easy installation, Nice RemoteCons: The USB, AVI Ports slot is in odd position.. its downwards facing, so if the avi cable is loose, it will fall down u need to tighten the scres.Sound is not that much awesome, but ok for the price.Finally i recommend this product.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "great all around for LED", "Author": "JOJO", "ReviewID": "RO7O4C6X015GJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my wife's computer in the living room, so I can play x box and watch football while she gossip and watch her own show and play her games.

The speakers are tiny (maybe 3\"x1\") and honestly I swear I used to have a transistor radio which sounded better. There is no bass AT ALL, and although again there are several sound presets, I couldn't even tell the difference between them. As this TV was intended for a tidy installation on a small cabinet in a bedroom, there is no space for external speakers which are the only possible solution to this. My wife agreed instantly too. She said her iPad has better sound, and I had to agree!So... don't be wowed by the LED-for-$300 thing like I was, unless you have a separate sound system. I was so disappointed I printed a return label then and there, and then went right out to the local Best Buy and ate the sales tax on a Panasonic TC-L32C3 for the same basic price ($319, which the LG has gone back up to since I ordered it). The Panasonic may not be quite so thin and high-tech-looking, and maybe the screen doesn't have quite as good a viewing angle or black level, but in general the picture can be made to look nicer (it has full manual adjustments) and the sound is SO much better it's laughable.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "save your stars", "Author": "jermin8er", "ReviewID": "R3KFYZZI0801MN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "People really need to save their stars for after at least 2 months before rating this tv.

Made October 2011. FYI, LG has 70 diff models of 13 diff sizes(19in-65in) listed on their website... [...] . Before the USA switched to Digital TV, Summer 2009, I bought a Channel Master CM-7000 converter box for my analog TV. The program scheduler on this box spoiled me rotten. I could see TV programming for each channel for the next 12 hours with a lot of detail per show. Then I bought my first HDTV from Walmart on Black Friday 2009, an Emerson 42\" Plasma with integrated TV programming & scheduling... Sweet! Now, I get the latest LG 32\" and ABSOLUTELY NO TV PROGRAMMING! WHAT IDIOTS! I checked their most expensive TV and it too has NO DTV programming! WHAT ARE THESE KOREANS THINKING? NONE OF LG's TV's HAVE TV PROGRAMMING BUILT IN!!! This model is very dim compared to a plasma. There is motion blur on fast motion sports programs. I wouldn't use it for gaming. If you don't care about tv programming and plan to use the tv in low light areas and don't mind an average display, then this TV is for you. It's slow to turn on. On the plus side, you can use a USB stick to view JPG picture files BUT NOT VIDEO FILES the 2500 model does play video files (check out their PDF manual) OK, there is a silver lining here, lightest & thinnest TV EVER! ... as thin as a paper back book and lighter than 2 gallons of milk... better for hanging on a wall.
