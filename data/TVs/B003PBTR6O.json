{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect for our needs.", "Author": "John Q. Buyer", "ReviewID": "R2WVX2G480MZ1X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is being used in my sons room where it serves as both a television and a computer monitor.Pros:-Very affordable. (I picked it up for $160.00 including shipping) It was comparable in price to other LED CPU monitors by Veiwsonic, but this is the only one has a HDTV tuner built in.-It has a great picture. HDTV looks great, as does Blue Ray, and it can display up to 1920 x 1080 from my PC. Viewing angle is 170 degrees, as are most LED TVs-Easily wall mountable. This TV is very light and reasonably thin. The product description says that it is 4 inches thick, but that is for the removable base. The TV itself is only about 1.75 inches.-Digital audio output. It has both stereo RCA (read and white), and digital toslink (fiber optic) audio outputs with TruSurround HD. This a great feature if you are planning to use a stereo speaker system or surround sound, instead of the TV speakers. Which leads me to the cons...Cons:- The TV speakers sound awful. If you are looking for a TV that will not be part of a sound system, then this would not be a good choice.- There is an annoying delay when changing channels from HD to regular, but I guess that's typical. It makes \"surfing\" a chore.Other thoughts:I only removed one star for the poor sound quality because I never use the TV speakers on any of my TVs. To me TV speakers never sound great (though these may be the worst I've ever heard).Considering that this serves as both a high quality LED CPU monitor and a small, thin LED HDTV, I would say this is a great buy. Just be sure to have other options for sound. We are using a Logistics 2.1 speaker system that I picked up for around $25. If you are looking for a LED TV that has high quality speakers you will need to spend a lot more than $160.ps if you use a speaker system that uses the 1/8\" stereo plug, (aka headphone jack) you will need an adapter that converts to RCA. There's one for sale on Amazon for around $2", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Viewsonic VT1900LED 19\" LCD TV - No Headphone Jack!", "Author": "K. Nakamura \"NetAdmini\"", "ReviewID": "R3BQFWC9FPAN3Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The television is sleek and good-looking. However, it's all of this TV.The image quality is not so clear. Moreover, the brightness of the backlight cannot be adjusted enough.  The backlight can be adjusted only by three stages.  There are not so many changes even if it is adjusted.Setting screens are poorly designed and much unsophisticated. Moreover, the function of the clock display on the screen etc. is not provided either. The channel and time, etc. are only displayed for a few seconds though there is a button of \"Info\" in remote control.The sound is no good because the speakers are set downward.There is a USB connector, but it is for service only not for picture.The worst thing is no headphone Jack!  Therefore, the adaptor which converts from RCA audio Jack into Mini Phone Plug is necessary when connecting it to external speakers.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "ViewSonic 19\" LED HDTV", "Author": "Sonny", "ReviewID": "RBAXVGJT2Y15Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Programing software would not allow selection of my time zone, had to set time the old way!

The speakers are at the bottom of the TV facing down.  The sound comes out of the bottom of the unit and reflects off of the surface the TV is sitting on.I tried every audio adjustment possible on the TV and nothing will improve upon the cheap, tinny sound that sounds absolutely horrible.I am extremely disappointed with this television and am in the process of returning it.  I find it hard to understand how Viewsonic could design and manufacture such a poor product.  The picture is great, the fact that they are using the new LED backlight technology is great but it appears that no one a Viewsonic ever sat down to watch and LISTEN to this television.  If I worked in Viewsonic's design department this product would have never been approved for manufacturing with this extremely poor audio design flaw.My recommendation is DO NOT BUY - YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.And that is truly a shame.  I hope someone from Viewsonic takes noteof this problem and takes steps to improve their future televisions.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Integrated digital ATSC (HDTV) and NTSC TV Tuners\n19\" 1366x768 native resolution\nEdge lit LED backlight, SRS HD Audio with SPDIF output\nATSC/QAM TV tuner, 2 HDMI ports, VGA and component video\nClosed Caption Support and Parental Control with sleep timer", "Name": "ViewSonic VT1900LED 19-Inch 1366x768 LED LCD HDTV with Versatile Input Connectivity, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Fcct2miL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003PBTR6O"}}
