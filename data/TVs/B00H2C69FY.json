However, when I am shopping for items elsewhere the first thing I do is come to Amazon to see if there are any reviews so hopefully this will be helpful. I was amazed at how light the tv was coming out of the box. The stand seemed like flimsy plastic, but once mounted to the bottom of the tv the unit was actually quite solid.I have only used the tv a few times but the picture seems really sharp and clear. The tv has nice speakers as you can easily hear the programs at a low volume level. We're only a week into the tv so far, I will come back and update if anything changes.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "so far so good", "Author": "suavechulo", "ReviewID": "R2EU2VLC9XENZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very leery about this funai t.v.  But so far I am impressed with the quality.  The set up was easy that a cave man can do it, basically 'plug and play'. so far so good. no complaints.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good picture quality and performance for a modest price", "Author": "Spaceneedleboy", "ReviewID": "R10U3VP126LQU8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LF320FX4F provides good LED display characteristics and overall competence for a low price point. Color rendering is good.  As is common with low-cost HD flat-panel displays, fast-moving action scenes such as during football games do exhibit some blurring (good but not state-of-the-art refresh rate) but the video display quality is eminently satisfactory compared with other television sets in this price category.The integrated ATSC digital tuner for over-the-air antenna reception is pretty good.  However, two important features were stripped out in order to cut costs: there is no signal-strength meter, and no known means to delete or add digital channels,  though there is a means of adding/deleting analog channels.Setup of the LF320FX4F is fairly easy except for a somewhat tedious process of assembling the display to the base. The supplied mounting screws for the base are the incorrect size, you may have a \"wobbly\" connection to the base until you go to the hardware store and find a screw that fits the holes correctly.The various inputs and outputs are fairly easy to access, which is a joy because I've encountered some sets including from major-brand manufacturers where input and output connections are very hard to access.Sound quality of the integrated speakers is acceptable, voices and music are intelligible, most buyers will want to add a separate home-theatre sound system.If you can buy one at a very low price, this seems to be a delightful choice.  I don't know the long-term reliability.  A lot of these were sold by a major retailer last year as a one-hour \"Black Thursday\" doorbuster special.  In spite of that, I'm optimistic that this set will last more than a couple of years.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "TV Type: LED\nScreen Size Class: 32\"\nVertical Resolution: 720p\nMaximum Resolution: 1366 x 768\nScreen Refresh Rate: 60Hz", "Name": "Funai 32\" LED 720p 60Hz TV | LF320FX4F", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MTw3S87FL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00H2C69FY"}}
