Expect the quality of the Panasonic industrial models, but with all the goodies (components).  The speakers are great, too.  They detach if you don't need them-- but give them a try, you might be surprised.  The stand is included and it is attractive, well engineered, and heavy with a capital H.  I worried about the fact that 720p is not native res for this panel, but now that I've enjoyed watching it for about two months now, it's not even an issue-- the picture is alarmingly excellent.  Finally, if you're looking for understated quality and class, this is it.  It is all black, thinly framed, and includes a separate \"media center\" so you can cleanly set it up.  The led's glow blue.  Love it.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "parts only beware", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2HNQHN0LIY7TS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Some poor person purchased this not noticing it was not TV that was for sale, it was for parts.
