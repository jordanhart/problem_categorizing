The picture is great and speakers aren't half bad.  But the best part about this TV is that it is under $1,000!  Incredible value here.  Zenith is now a division of LG, so there is no need to discriminate based off brand name.  Zenith and LG tvs are essentially the same, just rebranded.  If you don't need all the extra crap (internet connection, 3D, etc.) and just want a good picture, definitely go with this winner!!Note: Out of the box, the intelligent sensor is on.  This makes the picture look very dark.  I would suggest turning it off or turning it to low.Pros: Picture.  Price.Cons: Menus.  Not enough picture manipulation.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great bang for the buck!", "Author": "David P. \"ROUSHAC\"", "ReviewID": "R391NIOR9U8A1F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it from B*** B** in late 2011 during a sale (with free home delivery) at a price that I have not seen there or anywhere else before or since - $799. Very Few bells and whistles, but I don't need them. I run online movies, sporting events, etc. from a laptop directly to the TV through the HDMI port. Reflections on the screen from windows during the daytime and from lamps are a bit of a PITA, but that's what they make curtains, drapes, and light switches for, right? I have gotten lots of compliments on the TV.Reflections on screen **Sound ***Ease of setup ***Pic ****Overall *** (at the price that I got it at ****)* Poor  ** OK  *** Good  **** ExcellentAt anything less than $1000, I would be pleased with this TV, but at $799, I am REALLY HAPPY with it. :-)", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful TV", "Author": "A.

The picture on this is amazing and you can be sitting at any angle to watch it and the pic is still clear.  On some tvs if you had to sit to the side it would be hard to see the picture.Sound is great.  NHas energy saving options.This plasma is way better than the LCD we bought.  Lcd lets to much light in.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best bang for the buck!", "Author": "KT", "ReviewID": "RDQFPVJMSGPOO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one gorgeous tv. Deep rich colors, great blacks and whites, no buzzing or humming, plenty of easy to use settings and adjustments, 3 hdmis, 2 components, optical audio out, and most importantly NO 3-D OR SLOW, USELESS SMART CRAP! I have a gaming pc and an Xbox 360 hooked up to it and even the best smart tech will never compare to either of those. The only remotely negative things I can say about it are the stand isn't as strong as it should be. I had to put a small shim in it to make it level. And as with all newer tv's the audio is barely passable, but I have a surround system any way, so no biggie. I got this tv for $698 shipped and it looks just as good as  my buddy's $1,800 tv. I replaced my old 65\" DLP tv with this and I can't believe the difference! I'll be using this one until 4K tv's come down in price and get full support (that will be a while).", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "John Jerkatis", "ReviewID": "RH9DACFT3WSPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OIn a scale of 1 - 10, 10 being the highest, I would rate our new Zenith plasma TV a 11!", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Full HD 1080p Resolution\n600Hz Max Sub Field Driving\n2M:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio\nInfinite Surround", "Name": "Zenith Z60PV220 60\" Plasma HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J0etE1MUL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0065KT9LK"}}
