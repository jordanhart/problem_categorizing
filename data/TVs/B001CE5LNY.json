I went into BB to try and take a look for myself, the Full Gloss screen threw reflections all over the place, and bothered me quite a bit.Now take the guts of the A650 and put it into the same package, with a semi-matte screen. Now you have a killer combination that looks amazing on the eyes.Don't take my word for it, More Reviews:-Consumer Reports loves Samsung LCD's, which are ranked #1-Go to [...] , check out the Forums->LCD, you can waste your life on this site, I'd say go for the Pro reviews of the A650, and you'll see why people love this TV-Check out the reviews for the A650's here on amazon, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413D94/-Cnet's review of the A650, you will notice the only drawbacks they listed were \"relatively expensive\" amazon helps here, and \"shiny screen reflects ambient room lighting\" and the A630's semi-matte screen works to solve that issue, [...]Recommendation:I'm very happy with the TV: the back light is even across the TV, the blacks are crisp, picture quality can't be beat, the 120hz+auto motion result in smooth images and the semi-matte screen doesn't act like a mirror for the room like the A650's do. Finally, the surrounding frame is leaner and not nearly as noticeable as the A650s.Highly recommended. 5 Stars.", "Date": "September 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "630 or 650 or 550?", "Author": "Comdet", "ReviewID": "R2PF4AH6CYHLQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading reviews in Cnet and Consumer Reports, and feedback from owners on the AVS board, I knew I wanted to get a Samsung LCD. But which one? The 550, 630 and 650 are all highly rated, and all fell within my price range.I first looked at the 550. Great TV and the lowest price. The picture quality was top-notch, but it did not have the 120hz technology and Samsung's smoothing system (called AMP) to reduce motion judder. In side-by-side viewing, I could see a difference in the picture with those features, and, since the price difference was not much, decided to move up to the 6-series.Keep in mind that 120hz and AMP are two different things. You can turn AMP off (or set it to low, medium or high); you can't turn off 120hz unless you are in game mode. I like AMP set at low -- to my eye, that improves the picture without making it too smooth and video-like.Both the 650 and 630 are fantastic TVs, and either one would be a great choice. The major difference between the two is the glassiness of the screen - the 650 has a high gloss screen; the 630 has a matte screen (basically the same as the 550, but with a tiny bit more gloss). I have a very bright living room with lots of windows. The 650 acted like a mirror, reflecting everything to the point of being seriously distracting -- you can see yourself in the screen in dark scenes. The 630 was the perfect compromise -- better quality picture than the 550, but far less gloss than the 650.The advantage of the glossy screen is that it give more \"pop\" and saturation to the picture. Colors are deeper, blacks are richer, and the overall picture quality is a bit better. If I was using the TV in a darker environment (such as a basement), I'd go for the 650. But given the brightness of the room, the 630 was (for me) the better choice.I've been told the sound quality in the 6-series is a bit better than the 5-series. That was not an issue for me since I turn off the TV speakers and run the sound through a receiver. If you plan on using the TV speakers you may want to listen to both sets to see if you hear a difference.Very pleased with the set so far. You need to do a bit of tweaking to get the picture perfect, but the menus make it easy to do so. You can find configuration setups on several boards that will help point you in the right direction.Other pluses of the 630 are the more muted Touch of Red in the bezel. I'm not a big fan of the red color, so having it less visible is a plus. Very nice remote with easy to find buttons.I'm using the set with a Denon 1909 receiver, an Oppo 983H DVD player, and KEF 3000 series speakers. Everything works great together and I'm continually wowed by how great it looks and sounds.", "Date": "October 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "This is the 46 inch you want, at the best price", "Author": "Scott Roberts", "ReviewID": "R3BWD7VTNAY8SK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been watching LCD prices for 2 years.  40 inch LCDs have been dropping $50 per month for the last 6 months and it seems to have reached a plateau and may drop only $25 a month for the next 6 months. 46 inch has been dropping $100 per month the past 6 months and will drop $50 to $70 per month for the next 6 months.  With the recession, they may still drop $100 per month.I just bought this one, but i recommend waiting 6 more months if 46 inch is \"your size\" because losing $50 to $70 per month is a lot just to have a bigger TV.  Samsung and Sony are the best LCDs and this is (was?) the best price on a 46 inch Samsung and is as good as any other 46 inch LCD Samsung makes, but $800 less.  The \"better\" 46 inch Samsungs are thinner, a little better contrast (\"brighter\"), about 8% less weight, and have something called \"infolink\" that brings in active content like sports scores and stock prices.  The 60% increase in price for the other 46 inch Samsungs is too much difference for too little improvement.  They will come down in price $100 per month until getting to this price. This 630 model is a smaller number than the 850 or 950, but the 630 is only 2 months old.This 630 model is a \"matte\" screen.  It's for our den where there is a lot of light everywhere, so i prefer the 630 matte. The 650 is a \"glossy\" screen which means it can be more of stunning contrast and sharpness, but with possibly more reflection off the screen.This at $1370 is the lowest price on the internet right now, 10/6/2008 with free shipping and no tax.  Circuit city is selling it for $1700 plus tax.  Some are saying that the economic downturn is causing prices to drop faster than expected.  I expect this model to be $1000 in less than 6 months.  February might be the time to get a 46 inch LCD if that's the size and type of TV you've been waiting for.I have turned off the Auto-Motion Plus 120 Hz feature because it makes it look like I'm watching a 50 Hz BBC program.  I have \"fast\" eyes and i can see the flicker when there is movement due to the greater sharpness that Auto-Motion Plus gives.  There's something fishy about the \"120 Hz\" spec because the flicker feels about like 70 to 80 Hz on an old computer CRT.  I suspect that with AMP \"on\" it's not really 120 Hz in order to give it better sharpness.  So with 120 Hz turned off, there is just a little more blur on movement, but at least it doesn't feel like I'm watching an old episode of Dr Who.  In hindsight, i would have bought one of the older models that doesn't have the Auto-Motion Plus 120 Hz just to save a few bucks even if there was less contrast.  Samsung is really pushing this new feature, but I prefer it off. Others prefer it set to \"low\".The blur during movement on these new Samsungs (with or without the Auto-Motion Plus 120 Hz) is much better than the old LCDs, but it still is not as good as a CRT, plasma, or rear-projection.The contrast (\"birghtness\") on this is way way more than we need.  The brightness needs increasing during daytime because we have a lot of sunlight coming in, and then decreased again at night.A 46 inch LCD uses 250 Watt verses 500 W for a plasma.  This is the reason I choose LCD over plasma.  A 500 watt plasma \"heater\" in the room is good for winter, but not cool for summer.  500 W costs 5 cents per hour for electricity.Now that we're not even using it on a wall, I wonder if i should have got a rear-projection.I recently saw a $1400 LCD 46 inch Sony at a target (new edit 10/12/2008).  I was surprised to see Sony at a competitive price.  These prices are still dropping fast.=== UPDATE ===I am a little less happy with LCD technology. In comparing the LCD to my CRT and home theatre, the LCD easily wins on sharpness and contrast (at least over the projector).  But still there is something \"sharper\" about CRT and projection over LCD, and I prefer them over this LCD. What I have found out is this: the pixels in an LCD may be flashing at least as fast, but they do not have a \"dark period\" between frames so that our eyes see more blur even though in reality the screen is not blurring more.  Apparently, our eyes really need the dark time between frames to eliminate the perception of a blur.  Phillips ClearLCD fixes this and samsung and others are working on it.

Set-up was a breeze.  I am not an audio/videophile and just wanted a good tv.  I considered the 550, the 630 and the 650 series.  I went with the 630 largely based on looks.  I have several windows to the left of my tv and have had no glare problems whatsoever.  Also, the frame has a much smaller profile and you get the added benefit of the 120hz. The Touch of Color seems much more muted compared to the 650 and I like that. I don't have bluray hooked up to it yet so I can't comment on how that looks.Save yourself the hassle of having to buy HDMI cables by ordering them when you buy the tv.  I bought a mid-priced cable set and have been pleased with the picture.  I refuse to cough up $120 for a Monster HDMI cable.I sit about 10' from the tv and the picture size is just right.  However, I would recommend stepping up to the 52\" if you were any farther than this.The tv has varied by $20 on Amazon since I bought it. Since it is a new model you probably won't see any major price decreases for some time.

But then after 2 days it turned itself off and went into an infinite loop of turning itself off and on again. I have a service request in to Samsung and will update this post when the issue is resolved. It seemed important to point out potential manufacturing problems with these very popular units.Update:I put in a repair request using Samsung's online system. Got a call back the next day and scheduled visit from a Samsung repairman (actual Samsung van showed up, so not a third party company). He opened it up and found which board was at fault. He had guessed the power supply board and had a replacement, but it was something else. So he had to leave, get the new part shipped over, and rescheduled 4 days later. He just finished the repair, and the TV seems to be working fine.If I can find how to upgrade my rating, I will, because the TV itself is great. Works smoothly with my Tivo (via HDMI) and blu-ray DVD (via HDMI; both tivo and blu-ray send sound over to my stereo by optical digital audio).The matte finish on the screen really does help against reflection: I no longer see a reflection of the lamps in my living room as I used to on my old TV. So if you are making the plasma (or any reflective coating) versus LCD decision, this particular unit does have a nice diffusive coating.The \"touch of red\" on the plastic border around the LCD panel is very subtle, and I don't think my family even noticed---they never said anything.

Gross", "ReviewID": "R3IJS6G56B356Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Chose this TV over the samsung LN46A650 because of the semi-matte finish and because it has less red around edge.  The semi-matte is great, only see any reflection in extremely direct light.  The red \"Touch of Color\" is almost non-existant on this model, you really have to get close to see that there's any red at all.  Picture is amazing with HD, bluray, PS3, and even SD channels are better than I expected.  Swiveling pedestal also a nice touch, makes it easy for me to get behind it and swap out connectors (HDMI, component, etc all work great).  If I had one negative about the TV it would be that I have yet to find programming (HD or otherwise) that really benefits from the Auto Motion Plus 120hz feature.  After a few minutes I turned it off, tried using it (low, medium, high, auto) again randomly with bluray, videogames and sports, but always end up turning it off again.  It just can't seem to interpolate the frames to maintain consistent onscreen motion and is EXTREMELY annoying.  It DOES do better with Bluray, but I still don't see any way that I would keep it turned on.Still, this TV is incredible and deserves five stars (I didn't buy it because of the 120hz feature).  Also, I recommend you buy cheap HDMI cable.  I bought a couple $5 HDMI's online and there's no discernible difference between them and more expensive ones.", "Date": "October 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good TV, but some issues, unfortunately...", "Author": "Klisk", "ReviewID": "R26TM0BMZS3HRS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this TV, actually. But I'm sending it back. It's not for me.The allure of this TV was the fact that it's a matte-version of the 650... However, I recently found out, it isn't. This is a 120mhz version of the 550. This uses an older processor than the 650. I'm a bit disappointed by that, and the lack of an extra HDMI port. The PQ isn't as stunning as the 650, predominately because of the older processor, not because of the semi-matte finish.However. Glossy does give you better blacks. This TV has pretty grey-colored blacks, which annoys me. It also suffers from clouding/flashlighting, unlike the 650 I've used.I did buy this version because I wanted to avoid reflections... I also bought the 650 for my Mom. Her TV is just plain out nicer. The reflections? Not a big difference. You see the reflections on both TV's. This one just diffuses them with the semi-matte. But you can still see yourself during dark scenes! It's just not as clear.Compared to the 650, the difference between glare is minimal. It's there, but minimal. You see yourself either way, might as well get the better picture!My opinion? If you REALLY hate glare, then the 630 is for you. However, if you're just WORRIED about glare... Go with the 650. You will be much happier in the long run.This TV, the 630, is a great TV. I just feel like, for the money, you're not getting the 'newest' tech. Samsung treats their matte-users like second-rate customers, and for good reason: People prefer glossy. Might as well go glossy, and have the best technology, rather than having something older with matte. I do believe matte can give an outstanding picture... Samsung just doesn't think it's worth their time.Honestly: If this TV is for a living room with a large window, then godspeed. It's for you. If this TV is for any other situation, then the 650 is probably your choice.", "Date": "November 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Choosing between the LN46A550, LN46A650 and LN46A630?", "Author": "Matthew J", "ReviewID": "R3SHWDQRDPQW27", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When researching LCD TVs, I narrowed my search to the Samsung 5- and 6-series, based on reviews of quality and overall value. I went to our local Best Buy several times to also let my eyes judge in person what I had been reading.First, I'd like to say that all three of these TVs are quality units, but each has a different feature set and if you are in the same situation I was, hopefully this review will help you make an informed decision.LN46A550 (Released March 2008): Great TV for those on a tight budget who still want one of best pictures available on any 46\" LCD TV. Initially, this was my choice based on strong reviews and the savings it offered. The 550 has a matte screen, which reduces the reflection of ambient light and glare. I decided to narrow my search to the 6-series based on 120Hz processing (not available on the 550), which is a feature I wanted after seeing it in person, especially for Blu-ray movies and watching sports.LN46A650 (Released March 2008): Offering Auto Motion Plus 120hz and 50,000:1 contrast ratio, I initially thought this was an excellent choice. However, the 650 suffers from the same problem as plasma TVs, in that they reflect ambient light and significantly increase glare. Samsung chose to use a super glossy surface for their higher end LCD TVs, which increases contrast ratio at the cost of heavy reflection. Personally, one of the main reasons I was buying an LCD over a plasma was to eliminate glare. Samsung offers the PN50A650 for nearly the same price as the LN46A650, and you get a larger screen with 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.LN46A630 (Released August 2008): The first thing you might notice is that Samsung released the 630 five months after the 550 and 650. The reason for this was consumers wanted a 120Hz Samsung LCD in a matte-finish screen. Also, people were quite mixed in their opinion of the red Touch of Color (ToC) frame and thick bezel. The 630 provides a thinner bezel and mutes the ToC. I much prefer this look, both when the TV is on and off, so I'm very happy with the adjustments. As mentioned, this LCD uses the matte-finish, which eliminates the reflection of ambient light and glare. It was interesting when I was in Best Buy, because they had a 650 and a 630 side-by-side. Both picture quality was very sharp (40,000:1 vs 50,000:1), although the 650 reflected light from several sources. I actually stood right in between the two screens and moved to the left and right. When I was in front of the 630, I could not see any reflections and the picture was extremely clear. As I slowly moved to the left in front of the 650, my face and body reflected off the screen like a mirror, as well as other light sources. During bright scenes this was not noticeable and the picture was very good, but during dark scenes the reflection was very distracting. The 630 had none of these issues, with the same advantages of excellent picture quality and 120 Hz processing.I think this LCD is the best combination of quality and value available right now. Amazon.com has really separated themselves from all other retailers with no tax, free shipment and free white glove delivery. Speaking of which, delivery was excellent. Even without all of these features, Amazon.com is still cheaper than all stores by hundreds of dollars.The sound of the 630 is average out of the box, so I have a home theater in a box (HTIB) hooked up to it. This is pretty common for most LCDs, except the very high end models.Overall, I think the LN46A630 is the best choice among Samsung LCDs, in terms of price, picture quality and features. If you are trying to decide between the 550, 650 and 630, I highly recommend the LN46A630.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "One of the best LCD Displays available", "Author": "T.

There was no dust, no sticker residue, there is nothing that can be seen to be wrong with the unit. The only blemish on the unit is some very faint scratches on the console but you have to get right on top of it with a very bright light to make them out. The screen it self is perfect with no dead pixels. I was able to register the unit on the Samsung site and got an additional three months of warranty.My initial choices came down between the 46\" and 52\" Samsung models of 650 and 850. Because I got defrauded om the auction site for $[...] I had that much less to work with so I decided on the 46\". Between the three different models I ruled out the 850 since it was a bit pricey. I was going to get the 650 but after reading the glare issues and checking it out myself at a local retailer I ultimately decided on the 630. One of the uses of the unit is for PS3 gaming and if any you have the Eye of Judgement you know that room has to be pretty bright.The picture of the 630 is outstanding. PS3 games look amazing. Blue-ray content is breathtaking. Standard DVDs are wonderful as well with upscaling. I use standard DirecTV over a component connection and while it is no where as good as even an upscale standard DVD it is suffice for viewing. I would upgrade to the DirecTV HD service but I do not like the idea of having to pay $[...] up front for a receiver PLUS a monthly lease fee on top of the HD service fee.The unit has a crap load of features and more than enough connections. I currently run the DTV over component into my home theater, PS3 over HDMI 1, my PC over HDMI 2 and my home theater system over HDMI 3. Changing inputs is a breeze and adjusting the picture is just as easy.The colors and picture quality is great. There are pre-set modes for your picture and sound but you can fully adjust both if you wish. The Standard and Movie modes are suffice for normal viewing but if you really have the need to burn out your eyes just turn on the dynamic mode. The only issue I have with any of these HD screens is the brightness of the whites. I have same issue with my LG computer monitor. The dynamic modes are great for gaming and 720/1080 movies but not so good for say web surfing or anything that has a white background or allot of white in general.The black levels seem to be one of the biggest issues with any LCD display. While the 630 does not present the deep black levels of a high quality plasma the levels it does produce are more than suffice and of great quality. You are able to adjust your black level and really should have no issues unless you turn on the dynamic mode but even with it on the black levels are still very deep. Out of the many LCD models I looked into I have to say the 630 has some best black levels available for an LCD screen.The audio quality of the 630 leaves a bit to be desired. It seems that Samsung can make great displays but are completely lost when it comes to audio; this can be seen (actually heard) in nearly all their TVs and audio systems. The audio from 630 should suffice for the majority of users but even a low priced non-Samsung audio system will make a huge difference. Because audio was not a factor in any of my display choices it will not be factored in my rating of this unit.If you decide to hook your PC up to this display do not use the VGA connection. Go with a DVI to HDMI connector or a DVI to HDMI cable. The only reason to use the VGA connection is if your video card only supports VGA, and in that case it is definitely time to upgrade your video card. I am big RTS gamer and currently use two LG 22\" in dual screen mode for most gaming. I have 4 DVI connections (2 video cards) so I decided to hook up the 630 more for a laugh than anything and I'll tell you that there is no way I am going to unhook it!! It is outstanding on games, streaming video and DVD/BD video since I have BD player in the PC as well as the PS3. If your a Supreme Commander player and get this display you will be in heaven. World in Conflict and PS3 End War look even better.The 120hz is iffy for me. I am not big sports guy so I can't really comment on any motion blur as I have not seen any with or without the 120hz on. I have not noticed any motion blur in any fast paced FPS gaming either. I decided to keep the 120hz at the medium setting and there has been no issues. The 4ms of the unit only shows up when I get nuke happy in SupCom, WoC or go RPG crazy in GTA IV but it is minor.In the end after taking everything into account I would highly recommend the Samsung series 6 to anyone who wants a great HD display. If more connections are needed and glare is not a factor go with the 650 but if glare is a factor than the 630 is the best choice. I will also mention that the ToC on the 650 is far more visible than on the 630. If you have the extra cash than the 850 is an even better choice over the 650. The one for sure is that Samsung makes a great display and because they mass produce them they can often be found for a much lower price than their competitors.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beautiful HDTV, great Tuner, Failed within 24 Hours", "Author": "JP", "ReviewID": "R35DF6S05PIRUA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Samsung have great looking HDTV's. For its size this TV is relatively light in weight.Setup is really very easy with a prompted preset for Home Setup or Store setup. This avoids bringing the TV home and not getting what you saw at the store (Under store lights the color and contrast are very different).Over the air HD programs in 1080i are really stunning, text is so sharp and well defined with no ghosting (better than one will get through cable, and it's free!). The detail that can be seen on weather radar images at 1080i is phenomenal, it's like reading a topo map, its so detailed and clear!! Will have to get a blu-ray player to get the best video quality as well, I have only seen true 1080p in the store on this set with blu-ray and it looked really good. On a test pattern I saw white lines between black gradients, the sharpening and black enhancement features seem to cause this, don't over do these settings. If you goof it up beyond recall, there is a factory reset, so don't be scared to experiment.The angle of viewing is very critical with this TV. If one doesn't position oneself just right the colors fade and blacks turn grey. At the optimal angle the colors and blacks are wonderful.The Digital tuner is very sensitive and brings in channels other Digital tuners in my home cannot, and brings in all stronger channels at 100%. The program guide is a little disappointing, Samsung did a much nicer job on their set top HD converter box with this feature.(Tip for those considering Over-the-air digital TV, get a decent antenna, and dedicate one antenna for each TV, digital tuners don't like splitters and boosters). Amazon sell great antennas for less than $40 (Search for DB2, DB4 or DB8). One annoying feature of the auto tune is that it grabs both Analog and Digital versions of the same channel, requiring one to delete the analog channel to make channel surfing more pleasant. I didn't see a way to avoid this. After February 2009 this will be a moot point.The PIP feature is a disappointment. The second picture must come from a different source than the main picture, and also must be analog. PIP is not available if you activate V-Chip either. If you want PIP, this NOT the right TV.Like the review that William T. Reach wrote here at Amazon, the unit failed very soon after being purchased (the very next day) and went into a cycle of turning itself on and off continuously. It failed watching a TV show, blanked out and never came on again. Because this TV failed so quickly (and others have had the exact same issue) I can only give 3 stars. The local retailer was happy to swap out once they saw what it was doing (they seemed very familiar with the diagnostic light patterns). Fingers crossed this time. If it fails again then it will be refund time. I'll post an update if it does fail again.The remote is easy to use, however there is no way to operate the TV without the remote (typical with DTV's these days). Being a new TV, only high end universal remotes like the Harmony will work with this TV, so don't lose the remote or tear it up.One frustration is that it is not possible to adjust the TV's settings or modes while viewing still pictures on a USB drive, for some reason this is disabled. This sucked for me because I wanted to use a monitor calibration image I use on computers to accurately set black/white points and gamma. So had to eyeball the setup in the room while wathcing a show. The TV has different settings such as Cinema and sports, they really should let you change this setting when looking at stills, they are different to regular TV signals.If Samsung can improve their build quality, they have a winner here.", "Date": "December 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Don L.

I wasn't aware the 650 was \"glossy\" vs. matte, but we do have a bright room and there is not an issue, so I'm glad we chose the 630.

When I finally purchased it I felt content with the knowledge that I would be getting a high quality set from a good manufacturer. Overall this is the case except for on major issue!If you will be connecting this TV to a computer like I do you must be aware there is an issue with the Auto Motion Plus(AMP) setting. It is always enabled when the TV is started no matter what is set in the menu. The only way to disable it is to go through the menu and enable then disable the setting. This is what I have to do each time the TV is turned on. I find this unacceptable. The 650 series had a similar issue that has been fixed with a firmware update but us 630 owners are ignored. There is a PC mode that can be used if you connect the computer through HDMI2. It is supposed to help with lag by disabling many of the extra processing including AMP but even in this setting the problem persists!To those wondering what AMP is it is the the de-judder processor used to smooth out video. It interpolates frames to smooth scenes with fast motion of long pans. Many people dislike it because it makes everything look too smooth; this is referred to as the \"soap opera effect\". I have contacted Samsung about this issue and will update my review with the outcome. If it is not fixed shortly Amazon or Samsung will be picking up this set and I will be spending my money elsewhere. I hate to feel this way because other then this one issue the TV is great.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: I would like to thank Amazon for being so good about the return. They picked up my TV and I then ordered the LN46A650. The only issue is that I am still waiting for the refund. I contacted their TV returns department and was told it normally takes around 3 weeks for the refund. It is not a big issue but I want people to be aware.Having now spent some time with both TV's I feel that I am in a good positing for some important comparisons.First I have been surprised by how much better the 650 looks in comparison to the 630. The 630 had some ghosting issues that are not apparent at all with the 650. My girlfriend even noticed which says a lot!Second, the gloss of the 650 is not as bad as I expected. It does not detract from my viewing and I can see how it increases contrast and \"pop\" with the image. Having said that, I would still like a slightly more matte finish.Third, the issues with the AMP bug I had with the 630 are not present with the 650. I was a bit worried but am pleased to say that when I turn AMP off on the 650 it stays that way.The remote on the 650 has a Ipod like wheel that can be used to navigate the menus which I don't like. It can still be clicked in the 4 major positions like a normal menu button but I still found the 630 remote to be better. The menu navigation on the 650 is also a bit slower from some reason. There is a much more noticeable lag with the interface.Overall unless you have an extremely bright area I would recommend the 650 series hands down over the 630. That is not to say the 630 is a bad set but the 650 is simply better. The major reason for my upgrade were the issues with AMP and HTPC's, but the overall increase in image quality was a very pleasant benefit. I hope that my bad fortune will help others in a similar situation and might also help those who are on the fence between this set and the 650 make a educated decision.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great screen", "Author": "W.

Later models have more inputs and some additional features, but they also go for the glossy screen.  While this bumps up the contrast ratio, it reportedly increases the effects of glare.

Combined with an upscaling Oppo 971H DVD player, I don't see a need for Blu-Ray at all, actually. 120Hz plus anti-judder/smooth motion is great for sports.  The nice thing is that the TV remembers the settings based on the input that you are using.  For example, my DVD HDMI input has Smooth Motion turned off, and my TV Coax input has it turned on.I was concerned about the Touch of Color being distracting, but honestly, I can't even tell that it's there.After about a month of use, I can say that I don't have a single complaint.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Experience & Great TV", "Author": "bmorton \"bmorton\"", "ReviewID": "R2N41UDP4HNJQ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I was doing everything in my power NOT to buy a TV from Amazon.  Not because I don't like Amazon but because to me... you just buy a $1350 TV from Sears or Bestbuy.  You know, a store you can take it back to and complain if the thing is a dud.  Well, I tried and tried to give Sears or Bestbuy my money for this TV and for several other models (Sony Z series and the LG 70 series).  I started looking for a TV so I could watch the Super Bowl in HD.  Started the search after getting back from the AFC Championship game in Pittsburgh and I was on a mission!  So, several trips to Sears (two seperate locations) and multiple trips to Bestbuy (again, more than one location)... and I had nothing!  The people at Sears basically told me there was no way they could get me a TV for the Super Bowl (it was still almost two weeks away at this point!!!) and Bestbuy was doing everything in thier power to sell me a TV that was $700 more than I wanted to spend.  By 1/22/09, I was really beginning to wonder if I'd have a TV for the game. Destiny intervened at that point.  I got an e-mail from Amazon that guarenteed TV's ordered on the 22nd would be there in time for the game. My sister had ordered the same model from Amazon and had great success so I decided to go for it.  Well, the TV came with two days to spare, the shipping was free and the service was great.  The TV is great.  Great picture, great connectivity, and great for a room with a lot of ambient light.  This model has a matte finish screen which is different than most Samsungs. That matte screen makes all the difference in a room with a lot of light.  There are too many settings to figure out on your own so I went online and found out how many other owners had callibrated this model (Bestbuy was really excited about selling me the same service for $250).  Callibrating the set made a big difference and only took about 20 minutes. I recommend reading some of the posts of other owners as there's a wealth of information about how to callibrate this model for different needs/likes/applications. At this point, I've had the tv for less than a week but it has been great thus far.  It was amazing to watch the Steelers win the Super Bowl in HD.  At one point during the game, I believe I hugged the TV. It's an intuitive design so I was able to get most things going right out of the box.  I did hook up a sound bar (Yamaha YAS-71) and was please with the combination.To me, the point here is two-fold.  One, it's OK to buy a TV online (saves money and the hassle of dealing with so-called \"experts\" at the local retailer).  Second, the Samsung 630 is a tremendous value and its a great overall TV.

It's amazing to me that a technology of this quality is affordable to your typical consumer.  I've now owned this TV for about a month and it's still capable of producing that jaw dropping effect.  The only real downside to this TV is I find myself not wanting to do anything but watch it.  I've been running a PS3, a DirectTV HD receiver, and my computer into the TV (via an Onkyo 606) and they all look amazing on this TV.  The ability to use the TV as a monitor is a huge plus in my opinion.I've been watching the reviews and the prices on this TV, and other comparable models, since making this purchase and, honestly, I think for this level of quality there isn't a better deal out there.  The LN46A650 is the more popular TV.  I went for the 630 because I didn't think the extra $100 (at the time I made the purchase) was worth slightly better colors and an ethernet and HDMI port, especially if it meant having to deal with reflections.  The colors on this TV are phenomenal, so I'm pretty sure went the right route.At the time I bought this TV, it was less expensive than purchasing at Best Buy and Circuit City by $150 (and included free shipping).  It took less than a week to be delivered (ordered on Monday arrived on Friday).  Incredible when you consider that it was ordered right less than 2 weeks before X-mas.

The remote is huge and not programmable so can't control my dish Network receiver like Sony's can.

Supposedly, Samsung has been shipping some of its 2008 TV models with panels (screens) from three different manufacturers.  You can tell which one you have by the sticker on the side of the set that says \"Version ____.\"  The first letter = the panel type (\"S\", \"A\", or \"C\").  (Example: \"Version AA02\" means you have an \"A\" panel.  You can also tell on the back of the set: look at the model number, then there is a space, then the letter A,C, or S.)  Apparently, \"S\" panels are manufactured by Samsung (in Korea?) and use Samsung's SPVA technology, while \"A\" and \"C\" are outsourced (to Taiwan?) and don't even use the same pixel structure (if you take a close-up picture of the screens, the pixels look completely different).  Apparently, all 650s are \"S\" panels, and all 52-inch 630s are \"S\" panels.  But with the 46-inch 630s it seems that early on in the production run they were \"S\" panels (so that is what the pro reviewers and magazines likely based their reviews on and that is what seems to be on all showroom floors), in the fall it was somewhat of a lottery, now they seem to all be \"A\" panels.  (I purchased one very recently from Amazon, and it's an \"A\" panel.)The issue with the \"A\" panels is that the color does not look as good off axis.  On mine, once my viewing angle is greater than 20-30 degrees horizontal or 15-20 degrees vertical, there is a noticeable change in color (it looks slightly washed out, or pastel-like, or like there is a really thin white haze or something, hard to explain).  It does not look BAD, and it may be better than many other sets out there, certainly better than most LCD sets have been in recent years.  However... I looked at a 650 in person and the colors did not really change at all off angle.  I also looked at a 630 in person that was an \"S\" panel and the colors did fade off angle, but not as much as my \"A\" panel 630 seems to.Again, it's not a BIG problem.  I think the 630 is a fantastic set and a great value.  And this info from the Internet forums about the different panel versions may not be accurate (maybe it's just set-to-set variations, or subjectivity, who knows).  I'm just passing on what I learned in another forum.  And my own viewing test could be flawed.  But, that is my personal experience so thought people should know.  If viewing angle is one of the most important things to you and you're discriminating, then this may be relevant to you.  On the upside, I have not seen flashlighting or clouding or the other issues people commonly complain about with LCDs.  The 630, even my \"A\" panel, is a great TV, really great value.  But I wish the picture did not change (even a little bit) when vieiwing off angle.  If it didn't have that issue (which for me is pretty important, maybe not for you), it'd be 5 stars.I actually think I should give it 3.5 or 4 stars, because other than this issue, it's awesome.  but amazon doesn't let you change the rating.UPDATE (Feb 6 09):As I mentioned in the original part of this post (above), I am not too thrilled about the viewing angle of my \"A\" panel LN46A630. Am considering returning and getting a 650 instead. I went into BB today and took a long look at the 650 and how it looks off angle. It was an \"S\" panel, version SQ01. I must have walked back and forth a hundred times. They had a segment of Conan O'Brien that was like 5 minutes, and his face was on the screen the whole time, so it was a good test for how flesh tones change off axis. I observed that this 650 changed very significantly by 45 degrees. His face was orange dead center, and white at 45 degrees. It was a pretty linear loss of color as the viewing angle increased.I tried to do this same observation at CC last week, and thought then that the 650 looked really good off axis (better than a 630 \"S\" that was on display near it, and both seemed to be better than my 630 \"A\"). But there were a billion people there in the way and the video loop had very few faces, so it was hard to get a really good look. Today at BB I got a REALLY good look. I did it about 20 times (there were other segments with faces, not just Conan) to convince myself. I am convinced, the 650 \"S\" looked radically different (color-wise) at 45 degrees than straight on.They had a 530 (I think that's what it was, had a matte screen) \"A\" panel on display. It definitely changed off axis. Pretty much like my \"A\" 630 does.My 630 doesn't change in such a linear fashion as the 650 does, it seems to hold until about 20 degrees, then fades from about 20-30 degrees, then holds.I think the gloss on the 650 gives an appearance of the colors just exploding out of the screen, and that masks actual color changes somewhat, because the shine holds throughout.I am still on the fence. Maybe my 630 \"A\" panel is different, not necessarily worse than a 650 \"S\" (i.e., the 630 is a little worse off angle, but doesn't have the glare of the 650). Though now I'm starting to notice mild flashlights. Uggh.BTW, one thing I've noticed (not sure if it's been mentioned): in any model the off-axis color seems to be worse on the bigger screens than the smaller ones.

Every time I think I have turned a corner that will bring me to the end, a fixed television it is not so.I should have never purchased a Samsung product. Plain and simple. I know this now. I purchased an LCD television and to make matters worse I purchased it from Sears. This was on 12/19/2009. I was happy. The TV worked and it looked good. Until it didn't. In late July of 2009 the TV would not power on correctly.- I called Samsung support because Sear's sales person told me it only had a manufacturer warranty unless I upgraded to theirs. We did some troubleshooting and the technician determined the problem. He said the parts will be shipped to me and I will call a technician who will visit and fix the TV.- A week passes and I do not see any parts. I call the repair company Samsung has contracted and they say the parts are back ordered. Okay I wait.- I wait a month and I see nothing. I check the status of my ticket online and it says the ticket is canceled. I call the repair company again. They say the parts are still on back order and suggest calling Samsung.- I call Samsung and the woman tells me the parts are back ordered. I ask here for an ETA. She says there is none. I ask her what good is my warranty if there are no parts to fix the TV. At this point it seems there is no intention of fixing my TV. The apathy pours out of my earphone. I finally tell her that I just wish to sell the useless TV back to them. She offers to arrange for Executive Customer Service to exchange the TV. Since it will never be fixed I settle for that.- After a week someone finally calls me. This is in early September. We exchange information. He says that he will prepare the exchange which will take a week (really?? a week) and then it will be sent to Sears to exchange the TV since I purchased it there. I ask how long all of this should take to get the TV. He says two weeks.- The next week I get a call from the same representative (I guess it does take a week) and he says the information has been sent to Sears and I should hear from them shortly, riiiiiiiiight.- I do not hear from them. I call Samsung for a status. They say they know nothing. This I do believe. I ask them to check with Sears on the status, maybe give a nudge.- Two weeks later there is no contact. I call Samsung and ask if I can have the contact information for the person at Sears receiving the exchange request and an RMA number. The woman gives me the RMA number but will not release the contact info. I ask her if she can contact them for a status. She says she can re-submit the request.- Still nothing. I try calling some Sears numbers and no one knows what an RMA number is. I am not joking. Everyone said they didn't even know what an RMA was.- A couple days later I get a call from I'm not sure if it was Sears, Samsung or an intermediary. She said she was from some company other than Sears or Samsung. They say they will contact someone at my local Sears store and make sure something happens.- Nothing happens. I decide to visit the store (09/04/09). I am told that nothing can be done until the department manager is back and he will be in on Saturday. I come in on Sautrday. He is not there. I come in on Monday. He is not in. I am told he will be in on Thursday. I come in on Thursday. He is in. I give him the RMA number from Samsung. He checks it and calls HQ. He says it is not a Sears RMA number and is probably a Samsung reference number. He asks me to call Samsung and see if they can e-mail the exchange information to him and he will try and take care of it. He gives me his card. I call Samsung and give them the info. They need a fax number. I get the fax number and call back the rep updates the ticket and I ask him if someone will e-mail/fax the info. He's says that he is sure someone is working on the ticket and it will be done.- (10/09/09) I am sure no one is working on it. No one ever has. Why would they now. I call Samsung. The women confirms that no one sent any information to the department manager at Sears. She says she will check with her manager to see if she can re-submit the request to Sears HQ (which has been done twice supposedly) and \"maybe\" in addition send it to the department manager. No promises, no hope, end of call.I have no idea what is going on. When I get on Samsung's site both tickets, the repair and exchange ticket are canceled (but I'm sure some one is working on it).

CNET and other various sources pointed towards Sony and Samsung as the clear cut best in field TVs, giving Samsung a slight edge.  CNET gave the 650 version of this TV their Editors' Choice award.  They said that the only thing that was different about the 650 model and this 630 model was that the 650 had too much of a glossy screen and reflected too much ambient light.  Well the 630 solves that problem perfectly.  Sure the 650 has an additional HDMI port but really, who is using a TV of this caliber without some decent HDMI capable receiver anyway?  You should be at least.  Whatever the case may be, the 630 has plenty of inputs for all your needs and even if I didn't have my Onkyo TX-SR606 (which is great in its own) I could still hook up my PS3, HD cable and Blu-Ray player all at the same time without any problems.The 120Hz refresh rate settings are fully adjustable and make a huge difference when watching sports in HD.  The realism is truly incredible.  You probably don't need it though when just watching regular HD TV or movies since the nature of all 120Hz TVs makes the picture look more like video rather than film.  It's hard to explain but even my friends who have absolutely no tech knowledge who came over to watch an episode of House in HD noticed that people walked around a little too realistically.  But the 630 has the option of turning the 120Hz refresh rate down when watching stuff like that.When I bought this I actually went on the Amazon Warehouse Deals section and bought an open box model.  It was listed as open box without any damage and it was almost $200 cheaper than the regular, new, full priced TV.

They came at 1pm and brought it up to my 3rd story apartment, unpacked everything and made sure it worked.  I say this because they don't have their \"White Glove\" option with the Warehouse Deals, but I can't imagine what else they could do with it.  The service was great and the TV turned out to be exactly what they listed it as.  No missing parts, everything worked exactly as it should, not even a single scratch on the TV.

I'd viewed in-store the more expensive Samsung model, the LN46A650. I preferred to buy this one since it had almost all of the features of the LN46A650 (was missing one extra HDMI port relative to the LN46A650 and some other minor features) and also had the matte screen, which was a huge plus for me since we had large windows in the room. This model is at a sweet spot for features/price. You get much more than the Samsung 5 Series for a very good price. The picture quality is outstanding and I haven't done any tweaks to any of the settings yet. As far as the matte screen goes, I see no reflections on the screen. This is supposed to have a slightly lower contrast ratio than the glossy screen but I couldn't tell the difference and am far happier with no reflections.

But other than that- the A630 is a far superior model in my opinion. Here were the two big issues for me-1.  it has a matte finish and not a super-glare intensive, glossy monstrosity that most people complain about. 2. the Price. Online I got the A630 for about $1300 and the A650 was about $1600 at the time. People say that this TV has some sound issues, but if you are using HDMI cables- you should have no problem.

I got this t.v. after I had my LN40A550 stolen from my home.  Thankfully insurance covered the cost, so I shelled out a few hundred more for this set, and I AM SO GLAD I DID!  Being a guy I subscribe to the whole 'size doesn't matter', but the jump from 40\" to 46\" is amazing.  Just that alone makes the t.v. a plus, but when you add in the 40,000:1 v. 20,000:1, and the AMP feature, this t.v. blows the 550 out of the water!I don't review stuff, I don't recommend stuff, but I've been so blown away with this set I had to at least throw in my 2 cents.  I've never had a problem with Amazon, and their delivery, and once again I wasn't disappointed.  They gave me a 12 day estimate for delivery, but it arrived cross country only 3 days later! The delivery guy brought the set in, set it up, inspected it, and was nothing but professional.  Again, this is why I'm writing this...it's so easy to post a complaint, but far too many people fail to write about the positives.Back to the set...one thing I have no clue about is the 'touch of color' that they are talking about.  My place is full of windows, thus the matte screen, and I can't see any red.  In fact, the only way that I saw any red on the set was when I busted out the flashlight and ran the beam around the edges.  Then I could see it, but if you are expecting anything 'noticeable' then you will be disappointed...If you care less about the 'touch of red', like me, you will be glad to see that it's not even noticeable!All in all, this t.v. is ridiculous!  Watching it right now, and still blown away.  You can wait for the price to drop even further, but I don't know how far it can drop.  The price fluctuates on Amazon through out the day from $1500's to mid-$1400's (from Amazon, not other dealers).

I was surprised when the package tracking provided by Amazon (link to CEVA site) showed an estimated delivery date of 30th Jan, even while the Amazon site continued to show a 3rd Feb delivery date.The logistics company called on the 28th to schedule an appointment. The delivery process was completely flawless and the CEVA staff were very courteous and careful in their handling of the TV. As indicated, it was truly \"white glove\" delivery as they unpacked the TV and placed it in our family room in the basement.We mistakenly asked for the packaging to be removed and then remembered the UPC required for the $200 NFL store coupon and called CEVA to request for the return of the TV packaging. CEVA was really nice and they called their delivery truck to return the packaging materials.The TV itself is outstanding and all the good reviews were validated. I am really glad I went for the matte screen instead of the LN46a650 as I think it really makes a huge difference even without a direct lighting source behind. As we like to leave the room light on when watching TV, I think the glossy screen would have been distracting.The TV has an amazing array of features and the remote is quite easy to use. The LN650 has a wheel remote that had bad reviews and I am quite happy with the 630 remote that has all conventional buttons. I also found that the the TV automatically switched between the 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios when changing between analog and digital channels on the STB. My earlier Toshiba needed a manual change in the this which was quite bothersome.Picture clarity and contrast levels are outstanding and I was blown away by the details visible on a 1080i broadcast with this TV.

I've always owned Sony TVs and was sure I was going to purchase a SONY LCD TV when the time came to upgrade. After doing a lot of research (here, at AVS Forums, CNET, etc..) it appeared that Samsung LCDs in the price range I was looking (under $2000) offered the best picture quality. While reading about them on the internet is nice, you really have to go to actually see them before pulling the trigger. Maybe, just maybe I'd like the Sony better after seeing it in person.I went to Sam's first. They actually don't carry (at least not in the store) the LN46A630, but they did have the 650. I noticed how brilliant the picture looked...I liked it better than the Sony next to it (sorry, don't remember which model is was). Once thing I noticed that the screen was very glossy. Our living room has two huge windows and I was concerned about glare (something that we hate about our Sony CRT). After doing a little more research, I read about the 630 and thought it was perfect.BestBuy carries the 630, so I went there to see it in action. I wasn't disappointed. It had a beautiful picture and a nice list of features. This was the one and Amazon offered it for the best price (I checked Circuit City's going out of business sale, but they had the highest price of them all).I currently have it connected via component cable to my HD cable box (my HDMI cables haven't been delivered yet). Picture quality is outstanding on HD channels, though some have a better signal/content than others.  SD channels PQ ranges from excellent to decent, but that's more due to the source and channel. Having such a big screen definitely shows the flaws in some SD channels.I don't have a Blu-ray player yet. That's my next purchase (Samsung BDP-2500), so for now I just have my old progressive scan DVD player. The PQ is good, about what I expected. I'll update this review once I get it.I have it connected to a HT receiver, so I can't comment about the sound.Bottom line is you can't go wrong with this LCD TV. I think you'll be very happy with it, especially considering you can get it for under $1500.UPDATE: I finally got a blu-ray player (BPD-2500) and watched a few movies.

The set-up was easy enough with HDMI cables for all of my electronic units.  It took me only a few minutes to actually turn it on and see the picture with a blu ray disc, and it looked amazing with \"Black Hawk Down\" without any initial picture set-up.I bought an Onkyo receiver and an Onkyo 6.1 speaker set.  I already had a PS3 and XBox360 set-up and had my cable box switched over to a HD box with DVR.  I bought allot of blu ray movies during the big Thanksgiving sale and actually ended up getting a samsung blu ray player for under $100.  I watch my movies on the blu ray player and save my PS3 for gaming.  All these units look amazing on the samsung 630 and they were all an easy hook-up with HDMI cables, (oh, by the way, don't pay more than $5 for HDMI cables as you can find them on Amazon for that price and they work just the same and I havent had any issues.)I did set-up my picture on the tv by going through the AVS forums and taking somme advice from some of the postings on there, and it makes a difference.  I wasnt going to pay $300 for someone to come and set it up for me.  I did it free through the AVS forums as there were plenty of help there and my tv looks amazing now.  This is from a guy who previously had a 27\" tv I bought 5 years ago.  I updated my whole entertainment center at once and I can only say I'm in love with it all.As far as the tv goes, it is easy to set-up, there is hardly any glare, and it is the best picture I have seen for the price of under $1500.

The picture is stunning when pared with a high quality signal. For those who have yet to take the plunge on HDTV let me share that all channels are not the same with regards to HDTV quality. I know. I was surprised to see that too. But it is not the fault of this set. We selected this model, and not the 650, because of the sunlight in our family room. The matte finish on the screen is perfect. It reduces screen reflection tremendously in a bright room and we do not notice the reduction in contrast ratio compared to the 650.I do have a couple of outstanding issues: the setup menu could be easier to use and could list picture temperature as opposed to only having presets only. It would help in calibrating the set. The other is that I have what seems to be slight uneven brightness that I need to call service about. It is not, from what I read, a weakness of this set or Samsungs in particular. It is a weakness of LCD sets. It is slight and I am the only one who has viewed the set who noticed it. But then I am a perfectionist.You really can't go wrong with this TV. The picture is stunningly, almost distractingly, clear. The black levels are extraordinary. And the sound is very nice.

The matte finish is perfect for well lit rooms.  The picture is incredible.Several reviewers have complained about the sound and I have played with it enough to see how this could be an issue for some.

On the other hand, we also didn't want to sacrifice picture quality.  After watching movies, sports events and regular programming on this TV we can confidently report there is no sacrifice of picture quality with this model.

Williams", "ReviewID": "R1PLXIVYAPEJGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research I chose the LN46A630, which has the same specs as the 650 but has a matte screen instead of a glossy glass screen. It was supposed to be delivered by Dec 23rd but arrived on Dec 17th!! The delivery guy brought it into our home, unpacked it and placed it on our TV stand, then stood by as I plugged it in and turned it on. He didn't provide me with a checklist as the White Glove Service said he was supposed to (I realized this later) but everything is working fine and the picture is wonderful. I was uncertain about the sound capabilities, but was extremely pleased with the quality of the 630's downward firing speakers. They are quite acceptable for in-TV speakers and have a good spectrum of bass, midrange and treble. We'll be hooking up some external speakers in a few weeks to get even better sound, but I can easily live with the internals with no problems. They're not tinny-sounding whatsoever.Note: Make sure your TV is hooked directly to your incoming cable (if you use cable). I initially had the cable going through an old Samsung VHS recorder, and its internal tuner produced substandard quality video on the new TV. Once I realized I should plug the cable directly into the TV, the images onscreen improved dramatically, and that was even with standard definition channels.Our local Brighthouse cable provider will be hooking us up with high-def reception in the coming week, so I'm jazzed about what we'll be seeing in the near future. Add to that the switchover from analog to digital broadcasting on February 17, 2009 and the results should be astounding on both high-def and standard images. I'm hoping that the new digital broadcasts will take advantage of the entire screen. Current standard def has black bars at the left and right sides of the screen when set to 4x3 size (to get the whole image). I keep it at 4x3 for most channels, and detest the stretched look of 16x9.Our new 46\" Samsung 630 replaces an ancient 27\" Samsung tube TV that we've had for over 10 years. The 630 gives you the high-quality picture and sound you're looking for, but without the awful glare of the 650. I highly recommend this product.UPDATE 23 MAY 2009: We've been living with the 630 for 6 months now, and it continues to be a terrific purchase. It's been trouble-free and the picture and sound continue to astound. I continue to highly recommend the 630 over the 650. You will be impressed with its color and have none of the reflections of the 650's glossy screen. Superb product from Samsung.UPDATE 4 JANUARY, 2010: The 630 continues to be a wonderful and trouble-free LCD TV. We haven't had any trouble with it for over a year, and the image quality and sound are terrific. The High Definition channels we watch are absolutely stunning. I'm very pleased with Samsung's quality.UPDATE 30 APRIL, 2011: The 630 just doesn't quit! We've had nearly 3 years of completely trouble-free viewing, and I'm blown away with the quality and longevity of this product. Hey Samsung: Need another spokesperson?

Some reviews are written by folks, who have moved from analog TV to digital TV. Any digital TV will look amazing by comparison. Short of opening the box and looking on the back of the TV to the right of the model number there is no way to tell if you are getting a godd LCD made by Samsung or C or A screens. Channel displays vary from excellent to impossibgle to watch. DVDs are washed out and fuzzy. That is fuzzy in comparison to Netflix internet streamed movies, if you need a comparison. The old Magnavox played the same movies with perfect color and crisp sharpness, by comparison. THE set is going back. I'll try a SHarp and see if I have any better luck. I revise my rating to one star for the excellent remote, tuner and on screen displays. None of those matter when the picture is so bad that it is unwathcable.**********************This is a review based on a couple of hours of experience after delivery. This unit replaces my Magnavox (Philips) digital LCD model 37MF321D. It worked perfectly, if you could get it to go on. The latter is the reason that I replaced the unit. I recycled the Magnavox, giving it to a neighbor, who had no TV. If you leave it on all the time, it works perfectly. I would have gotten a Philips TV (best rated picture display in Europe) except that I was put off with many complaints about sound problems.Basics: I live in Houston, Texas. I use $10 Radio Shack rabbit ears. My viewing habits are primarily movies from Redbox and Netflix. My DVD player is a basic Sony, model DVP-NS57P. I don't believe it upscales to 1080P or 1080i. I sit about ten feet from the screen.After tuning via auto, I removed religious, Hispanic, and duplicate channels. What remains are channels 2.1, 2.2, 8 (8.1 is out of range), 11.1, 11.3, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 20.1, 26.1, 39.1, 51.1, and 55.1. I can afford either Cable or Uverse, but chose not to spend $600 minimum to watch the couple of channels that interest me, like the SCI-FI channel and the History channel. Direct broadcast channels received on cheap rabbit ears are much sharper than either Uverse or Cable feeds.The picture on the 1080i Magnavox was significantly superior (clarity and color stability) on average, particularly on weaker channels like 2.2. That is probably not an issue with commercially provided cable or Uverse, because the picture quality is not as good to start with. The Samsung tuner is much more sensitive than that on the Magnavox. With the Magnavox I had to reposition the rabbit ears to receive some channels. Samsung's tuner receives all digital channels without having to move the rabbit ears.So far I have noticed no improvement in quality because of the 120HZ  refresh rate versus the 60HZ that I had. Paying significantly more for 120 HZ is not worth it for the average viewer. The reason that I went with the 120HZ 630 versus the 60HZ 530 was two fold. One: the higher refresh rate unit was only $50 more - 1350 versus 1300. Two: there were negative comments about 530 and 550 model screens made in nonSamsung plants on the. Although the situation may be the same with the 650 and 630 TVs, I did not see any reviews bringing up that issue.The ten-inch long remote has button lighting, which is a great feature. The TV comes with the swivel stand attached. The sound quality and volume are both better than I expected. As is the case with most of these devices the sound volume varies, depending on the input source, channel, and TV mode (analog/digital.) I am not a fan of the high gloss framing around the screen. I would have hated a high gloss screen surface of the LN46A650. I have not read the instruction book, so I can't comment on features that I probably will never use.The display options are vastly superior to those offered on the Magnavox. When you push the CHLIST button all saved channels pop up as an overlay to the currently watched channel. The channel list includes the station name and title of the active show. Deleting channels is easy. Push CHLIST, scroll to the channel that you want to remove, push Tools, and select delete.DVDs are displayed well with colors comparable to the Magnavox. Due to the larger screen size (46 Inch versus 37 inch) detail is compromised somewhat.Delivery: The set sat in Dallas four days and in Houston one day. It was delivered on time, notwithstanding my feeling that it could have been delivered five days earlier. The crew unboxed and made sure the TV worked properly before leaving. I retained the box incaser the TV dies within a week.
