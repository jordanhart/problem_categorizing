{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WOW! THIS TV IS FANTASTIC!", "Author": "VAL", "ReviewID": "R2R4HP59R2NFGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE PICTURE QUALITY OF THIS TV IS SPACTACULAR. PREVIOUSLY HAVING A 55\" LCD TV (LG55LH40), THIS TV APPEARS SO MUCH LARGER AND THE PICTURE REALLY FILLS THE ROOM. THE COLORS ARE MUCH MORE VIBRANT AND THE PICTURE IS MUCH LIGHTER, BUT WITH FULL COLOR. WITH ALL LIGHTS TURNED OFF IN THE ROOM, THE TV FILLS THE ROOM WITH ADEQUATE LIGHTING AT NIGHT, WITH THE PICTURE STILL EXPLODING WITH COLOR, STILL PROVIDING DEEP DARK HUES AND BLACKS. I LOVE THIS TV. IT IS BY FAR THE BEST TV THAT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great HD Picture", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R1OOY0ICN9CCRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great HD picture.  Moderate SD picture (but mostly due to TV being so large).  One dead pixel on arrival.  Concerned that the LG WI FI dongle has poor reviews and hoping LG invests in a new WI FI dongle compatible with this TV.
