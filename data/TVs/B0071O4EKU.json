If you change `Eco Solution' setting' to' Off', it dramatically changed the picture.  When you first turn the setting to `Off', the picture turns exceptionally bright.  However, it is not as bad as you think.  While having the `Eco Solution' setting set to `Off', I made the following changes to my settings and I'm updating my review to allow for a choice between the two options.  No matter which setting changes you choose, your picture will be greatly improved.  It's just a matter of taste.Again, my goal all along was to get the clearest, most stunning picture that the set had to offer without comprising the beautiful blacks, nor the brilliant colors, nor the outstanding 3D like effects you can sometimes perceive, all while never having to change the settings between channels or sources, no matter what the lighting of the room may be. I believe that I succeeded in this endeavor.If you choose to set the `Eco Solutions' setting found under the `Plug & Play Tab' to `Off', then try these settings.  I recommend that you do a `Picture Reset' first.  This is found under the `Picture' settings.Under The `TV Picture' settings, I have the `Picture Mode' set to `Standard', the `Backlight' set to `10', `Contrast' set to `80', Brightness set to `45', `Sharpness' set to `50', color set to `50', and tint (G/R) set to `50/50.  Under the `Advance Tab' settings, I set the `Color Space' to `Native', the `Dynamic Contrast' to `Low', the `Black Tone' to 'Dark', (and here is a big change), the `Flesh Tone' to -3, and the `Motion Lighting' to `Off'.

However, I love Amazon and I love this TV!PROS:This TV is aesthetically gorgeous and made a solid hand shake with my receiver.  It has surprisingly smooth sounding speakers that I can finally hear over my loud AC.  The colors are vibrant, vivid, actual, and true.  The picture can, at times, appear to look like a 3D TV when viewing certain movie sources.  It quickly powers on and off and plays a sweet sound.  It comes with a perfectly sized backlit remote that has a sleep button on it.  It does not use Edge lit or ARC channel technology.  Yea!CONS:I had a dickens of a time tweaking this set.  Initially, it gave off a bright, 'reality' type look. My circle of people thought that this was a cool thing. However, I hated it with a passion and spent the last two weeks trying to get rid of it.These changes made all the difference in the world and now there is uniformity between all of the source material.  Movies, be it cable broadcast movies or Blu Ray movies , as well as primetime cable shows including cable news, all look the way they were intended.SUMMATION:In my quest to find the best TV for the money, I've discovered that most of today's LED TV's are challenged with the aforementioned \"soap opera' effect.  In a way, it's understandable.  Networks broadcast their shows using a multitude of lighting choices.  That alone can be problematic.  Add to that the commercials that are broadcast in a non-HD format and then throw in the desire for TV makers to make TV panels super thin and you get too many options for your backlight to choose from.  All I know for sure is that I love the fact that, with this TV, Samsung chose to put the backlights across the whole of the back of the TV and not around the edges.  Also, please know that, in my opinion, this TV is easily thin enough, takes up surprisingly little space and has the audacity to look beautiful.I actually HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TV and think that it is a fantastic TV and it is being offered at a fantastic price. YOU JUST GOT TO TWEAK IT. I'm also writing it so that the next person doesn't become discouraged and want to immediately send it back. They would be making a HUGE mistake. I was about to return it myself because of that crazy REALITY look that it had on certain stations and formats. To my mind, my initial tweaking should have done the trick and solved the lighting problem. It is, after all, my fourth owned HDTV, one being a Sony XBR full array set, so I'm no stranger to tweaking.MORE THOUGHTS:The changes I eventually made was just counter-intuitive as first choice changes, hence, it took me two weeks to get it right. I don't have a college degree, but it seems to me that, if it took me two weeks to tweak the TV, Samsung could have, and should have; done it themselves before they put it out on the shelves. They know, or at least they should know, about the various swings regarding lighting amongst the various media sources. It just shouldn't be rocket science.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R3OIBYFNH2MMLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first state that while I didn't buy this product from Amazon, I felt it was worth leaving a review for this TV since buying a new set can be a complicated process, and I hope this review will make your buying process easier. Also, I happen to be primarily a gamer, so if you enjoy video games as well, this review might help you. To start, I'll give some general information, then dive into a more detailed discussion of the various settings and how I calibrated my TV.I'll get the obvious out of the way first: this TV is BEAUTIFUL. The first words that literally came out of my mouth when I turned on my Xbox 360 (even before I calibrated the video) were \"Oh my God.\" Granted, I'm upgrading from a 4-year-old 720p 32\" 60hz Sanyo, but even so -- the picture quality was notably impressive. Even a non-videophile (like myself) can appreciate this set. Blacks were black, whites were white. (Although looking back, I can see that my non-calibrated set looked non-ideal -- more on this later.) The audio, as to be expected with this sort of set, was somewhat disappointing -- the speakers are on the underside of the set, and I could tell right away that the sound was off. Calibrations to come!The set itself is easy to set up. Four screws put the base together, and another four connect it to the TV. I will say, though, that the set is VERY wobbly. A slight bump can make your set rock back and forth, so make sure to be VERY careful around it. As another downside, there are only two HDMI ports and one (!) slot for component/AV cables. What this means is, you can have component OR AV cables attached, but not both. The ports are surprisingly limited, so it's worth taking into account. If this isn't a problem, though, the TV definitely impresses. It's very lightweight, so you probably won't need to buy a new stand.So, on to the technical stuff. Again, if you're a gamer, these settings should help you get a spectacular picture; keep in mind, though, that everyone's different, and my preferences may not be the same as yours. Either way, these should be a good starting point.The TV has three main video settings: Dynamic, Standard, and Movie. The TV starts out at Standard, and you can change it to the other two. Dynamic greatly brightens the screen, and at first I thought I'd found my ideal setting. Upon closer inspection, however, one can see slight problems with colors -- some greens seemed too blue, even on the \"Standard\" color setting (not the same Standard as I listed above). Which brings me to my next issue -- Dynamic offers no option to manually tweak red, green, and blue levels, making it difficult to adjust. It's almost a case of \"what you see is what you get.\"The audio also has several \"preset\" options: Music, Movie, Clear Voice, and Amplify. Clear Voice and Amplify seemed too muted, so I never even bothered with them. Music and Movie, on the other hand, increased sound quality (and volume) but, like with video, do not allow you to manually adjust the equalizer.Finally, we have the Samsung Auto Motion Plus. This setting controls the quality of the image during fast motion, and like everything else, it requires some tweaking to get just right. For example: say you're playing a first-person shooter. When moving the screen from left to right (or vice versa), this setting controls how smooth the motion is. On one setting, you have nice, smooth motion, but the top of the screen \"tears,\" creating very noticeable graphical glitches. On the other end of the spectrum, the graphical glitches are removed, but the motion is back to blurry -- almost as if the TV doesn't have 120hz.Now then, I think it's worth noting the few problems I've noticed with the set in the months I've owned it:1. Vertical desync. This is the biggest thing, and I'm actually noticing it right now as I play Fallout 3. When moving through certain parts of the world, the screen will \"jitter\" and parts of the picture will become uneven. I'm not totally sure how to put it into words...there's no discoloration, there's just horizontal lines that move up and down across the image, making it look uneven. It only happens in certain situations, and only in certain games; I've never noticed it in Battlefield 3 multiplayer (I do see it sometimes in campaign, but only when scanning my screen across images that are large and close-up -- like buildings -- which is curious in and of itself), and I've never seen it in Halo 4, Enslaved, Mass Effect 3, or most other games either. It may be an issue with the AutoMotion Plus, but I'm not sure if it is, and it doesn't bother me enough to worry about too much.*UPDATE* The vertical desync stems from frame rate drops while playing certain games; if the Xbox or PS3 is unable to handle all the action on the screen, the frame rate will dip below 30 and the TV will be unable to consistently create a smooth image. Lowering or turning off Auto Motion Plus reduces the effect to a degree.2. Black levels. Black levels are difficult to get just right; sometimes you think you've got the right level of black, and then you notice certain scenes are too black, or too grey. I've noticed this quite a bit when calibrating the set for my Xbox 360 and PS3. In Fallout 3, I do get full, rich blacks when it seems like you should be getting them, but other times blacks seem too grey for my liking. If I increase the grey level or decrease brightness, however, the rest of the image can suffer. The PS3 calibrations were similar; in Uncharted, dark scenes (such as inside caves or tunnels) were extremely black at first, and I had to do quite a bit of adjustment to get them where I want.Something to keep in mind -- the Xbox 360 and PS3 have their own color calibration settings in the Display area. These settings (Reference Levels on 360, RGB Full Range on PS3) GREATLY impact the appearance of blacks on your image. Set Reference Levels to expanded or RGB Full Range to Full, and blacks are crushed. I have these settings on standard and limited, respectively, and have calibrated the set around those settings. The calibrations listed in my review are applied to both inputs for both consoles, and work fine.TL;DR of the last paragraph; the calibrations on my set are where they need to be. If they seem off, it's worth looking into the color settings on one's console and adjusting them if necessary.3. AutoMotion isn't everything I hoped. I touched on this a bit in my review; on the Smooth setting, the screen motion is very clear, but the \"tearing\" or \"jittering\" is even more prevalent. My Custom setting works fine for the most part, though; although motion isn't perfectly smooth, I barely notice it in most situations. And honestly, try looking left to right around your room. Objects blur a bit in real life, don't they? Anyway, I'm not sure is a Plasma is better for this (as I've never owned one), but this is still a nice feature and makes things look better than my old set.So where does all this leave us? These are the settings I'm using right now, and the TV looks and sounds as good as I think I can get it. This is the result of about four hours of tweaking. Also, note that I'm using HDMI to connect my consoles to the TV.EDIT 12/28/12:I've updated the video settings for the television; slight changes include lowering brightness, increasing gamma, resetting RGB sliders to default, and a few others. The changes create a vivid, bright image, but not one with too much brightness (my previous settings had the brightness levels a bit high, making blacks look gray in some areas).1. PICTUREMode: StandardBacklight: 20Contrast: 90Brightness: 44Sharpness: 35Color: 50Tint: G50/R50  1A. ADVANCED SETTINGS  Color Space: Auto  Gamma: +3  Dynamic Contrast: Off  Black Tone: Off  Flesh Tone: +4  Motion Lighting: Off  1B. WHITE BALANCE  R-Offset: 25  G-Offset: 25  B-Offset: 25  R-Gain: 25  G-Gain: 25  B-Gain: 25  1C. PICTURE OPTIONS  Color Tone: Cool  Size: Screen Fit  Digital Noise Filter: Off  HDMI Black Level: Either (This setting will depend on what sort of input you are using. Some inputs may default at Normal and not allow you to change it; others will let you set one or the other. Normal is a much brighter setting than Low, so you have to try both and see which works best for you. For example, I have my game systems on a setting that darkens the picture but expands the available range of color, so therefore I use the Normal (brighter) setting.  Film Mode: Off  LED Motion Plus: Off  1D. AUTO MOTION PLUS  Auto Motion Plus: Custom  Blur Reduction: 7  Judder Reduction: 5  NOTE CONCERNING AUTO MOTION PLUS: The higher this setting, the more vertical desync (which I mentioned earlier in the reciew) you will receive with certain games. For example, when playing Far Cry 3 on the Xbox 360, any scene which resulted in a frame rate drop would produce the vertical tearing. Lowering the Auto Motion Plus (or even turning it off) had an positive impact on the tearing, reducing it (but not eliminating it all together). For normal television viewing, the tearing won't be an issue, but if you notice it while playing a game, set the Auto Motion to Clear or Off.2. SOUNDMode: StandardSRS TruSurround HD: OffAuto Volume: Off  2A. EQUALIZER  100Hz: Two notches down from highest \"+\" setting.  300Hz: All the way to \"+\" setting.  1KHz: Two notches down from highest \"+\" setting.  3KHz: All the way to \"+\" setting.  10KHz: All the way to \"+\" setting.3. GAME MODE: OffAnd that's pretty much it. Blacks are black, white is white, and every color in-between seems as close to \"normal\" as I can get them. Again, these settings may require your own fiddling to get \"just right,\" but this seems like a good starting point.Anyway, bottom line: the picture quality is superb. The negative I listed above aren't enough to warrant a detraction in stars when so many times I've been amazed by the quality of the picture being put before me.

Morehouse", "ReviewID": "R1MDR4XAUT5TFR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is telling when you have to describe televisions as \"basic\" or \"smart\" - just like cellular devices.The EH6000 is a \"basic\" television that, simply, fits a need. It is a television that doesn't pretend to be anything else. I don't really need it to be anything else, either. It certainly is my television, but I mostly use it as a monitor for my PC and consoles. It does a wonderful job for what I need it for, and that's the key. My consoles and PC do everything I'd want a \"smart\" television for anyway. I also have no need or desire for 3D. At this point in time, there are few panels that give the true theater experience, and they are all well outside of my price range.The picture is nice and sharp. Out of the box, it was set to \"dynamic\" color mode which I found so bright it washed out the picture. I set it to \"standard\" color mode, and it fits my environment just fine. If I upgrade from my yellow light bulbs to white, I may change my color settings. I haven't tried the \"game\" color mode yet; though, \"standard\" seems to work fine for the range of games I've tried on Steam, Origin, and my consoles.It took some trial and error to find the right fit for my PC's graphics settings, but I expected as much. However, I was pleased once everything was set up and running. I was immediately impressed with the LED back-lighting. It is, by far, superior to standard LCD panels. I never realized just how dim my previous television, also a Samsung, was until I turned down the brightness settings in ALL my games. The environments really pop, and they don't feel over-saturated with \"forced\" brightness.I didn't see it in the description at the time, but I was pleasantly pleased to see the audio outputs on the back. Yes, I used plural. It has optical, which I was expecting, and analog three-conductor phone (aka: headphone, stereo eighth-inch). I wish it was analog stereo phono (aka: RCA) instead, but I can live with it.With all this praise, one might think there were no drawbacks to reduce the overall star rating. Sadly, Samsung left one, glaring omission. It's not enough to return the television and shell out extra cash for a higher-end Samsung, but it is something to complain about. It only has 2 HDMI ports. Yes, it is in the description. I realized what I was buying when I purchased the television, but I really wish Samsung had included more HDMI ports. All of their 3D televisions that I looked at had 4 HDMI ports. Why? Why? Why?! Most consumers have more than two HDMI devices, and switches can cause a degradation in signal quality.Oh also, the product description states the EH6000 has one component and one composite input. The statement is a bit misleading. There is one component/composite input. That's right. You can use it as EITHER component or composite. It doesn't bother me, but other buyers may wish to be made aware.As a note, I have no way of testing the tuner. I live outside of off-the-air broadcast range, so there is no way, at this time, to properly test this function. In the past however, Samsung has built in excellent over-the-air tuners.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost great.", "Author": "nickexperience", "ReviewID": "R1CVSJ0Q7QW00I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just got this TV (46\") set up yesterday and have been pretty pleased with it. I was excited to find a TV that presented a value proposition like this. The sacrifices I didn't mind making to save some $$$:I don't need tons of inputs.I don't need \"Smart TV\" functionality as I've always found standalone units (like my PS3) to be far more usable and far less frustrating then those embedded in the TV.I don't care how deep the TV is. It's not going on my wall and I've got plenty of front to back room for the TV. The thin bezel looks great.At first I was pretty much blown away by the picture quality, which shouldn't be surprising since I was upgrading from a 7 year old 32\" 720p Olevia. But I did start to notice something that might ruin this TV for me. In very dark scenes (i.e. when Hulu Plus is loading), I've noticed the dreaded \"banding\" issue that plagued some of last year's Samsungs. Again, it's only in moments of pervasive darkness, but it is quite noticeable. Now I just have to decide if it's bad enough that it warrants dealing with the hassle of replacing the unit.Update (06/01/12): I put in a warranty repair request with Samsung to see if the panel can be replaced. Basically, the local repair agency is ordering a replacement panel and will come out to inspect next week. At that point, I'll find out if I have impossible standards for an $850 TV or if the panel is legitimately defective. Either way, I'll update here after.Update (06/04/12): I activated Comcast HD this weekend and made sure to watch some football replays on B1G Network. Unfortunately, it looked awful. Extremely cool picture quality to the point where whites were essentially just blue. I also noticed more motion issues (judder) regardless of the settings I used. These issues are noted in this review on televisioninfo dot com where the reviewer claims that the EH5000 actually performs significantly better when it comes to motion.I have delayed the service appointment because I now have the LG 47LM6700 showing up tomorrow. The price came down again and now it's only $100 more. I've read great technical reviews on the picture quality so I'm going to compare the two. If the LG wins, which I'm fully expecting, I'll be taking back the Samsung.Update (06/06/12): Well, the LG came yesterday and I set it up after work. I was immediately taken with the quality of the picture. In general, compared to the Samsung, the colors looked more accurate to me. As I watched during the evening in almost total darkness, I was really impressed by the utter lack of significant backlight bleeding or flashlighting of any sort. I'm no expert, but the picture looks great to me, and noticeably better than the Samsung. Of course, these TV's seem to be pretty different from set to set, but in this case, the choice is clear: the Samsung is going back today.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent television, you will not be disappointed", "Author": "JK Cal", "ReviewID": "R1145X7I8MOZEF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was originally looking for the D6000, but I wait too long and it went end of life.

Unlike plasma sets, LCD/LED sets can be laid down flat. The pedastal has a little wiggle to it but I don't expect it to give me any trouble - it keeps the set perfectly level and straight. I found it necessary to unplug and then replug and power on my Comcast cable box to get a signal to HDMI port #1 and have had no trouble since the initial setup. HDMI port #2 correctly picked up my Bluray player. YOU MUST FIRST power on the Bluray player BEFORE attempting to switch the TV to port HDMI #2. If there is no live feed to the port, the TV simply refuses to switch to it.I decided to go straight to the THX Optimizer test patterns to do a consumer-level calibration. Most Disney movies with the THX logo on it will have the THX Optimizer (calibration test patterns) in the \"Setup\" menu of the movie disc. It doesn't have to be a Bluray title either, DVD movies will work just fine for a rudimentary calibration. Once I was happy with calibration, I made some further minor adjustments while watching a good channel. I can't stress enough that you must have a good channel! Don't expect commercials or standard TV channels to provide you with a picture worthy of adjusting settings to. Even a lot of so-called \"HD\" content on cable can be less than stellar. I suggest HDNET or your local live news for the best content. Also, understand that there are two HDMI ports so, if you calibrate for content from a DVD/Bluray player on one port, those settings won't be applied to HDMI port #2.I'm just in my first few days of ownership and am still making minor adjustments. I've found, for example, that I actually LOVE the \"soap opera effect\" these LED/LCD sets have on movie content! Viewing Netflix streaming and my DVDs and Blurays is like peeling the \"film\" off the screen so you can see \"into\" the reality of the movie as if you're right there! Some people don't like this effect - and Samsung gives you 3 main settings to choose from to help AND provides you with custom, granular controls so you can make it a personalized viewing experience no one else has. I'm using the \"custom\" settings with \"8\" for motion and \"6\" for judder. I find this combination gives me fairly stutter-free, blur-free motion, and just enough of the soap opera effect to make movies pop without over doing it. Just like color was an improvement over black and white (and you wouldn't set your color saturation to 100%), I feel these motion adjustments are an improvement - you just need to fine tune it to your liking.I'm VERY pleased with this TV!

I do think the current hype from TV manufacturers about 120/240Hz and motion compensation is just that, and more often than not does more harm than good. Without it, watching sports etc. on the TV is no problem whatsoever.A big plus in my opinion is the thin bezel that makes the TV look very professional and much more expensive than what I got it for, especially when wall-mounted.

Everyone looks like plastic dolls in a bad daytime drama.  It was obvious even to someone who is not typically discerning of such things.  The motion enhancement features do exactly what they say they do (noticeably), but that's not a good thing.

When viewed from an angle or front (the way you're actually going to) the bezel is very slim and the set looks great.It is a good thing that this set lacks apps etc.  Just get an AppleTV, Roku, etc.; you'll be better off and save money.The backlight uniformity is very good, much better than I've seen in any edge-lit set ever.The black levels and \"naturalness\" of the colors is not as good a a mid-range plasma and probably never will be on an LCD.  This is just a fact.  I wanted to get a mid-range Panasonic plasma originally, but my wallet ultimately decided differently.Though this is often the case on HDTV's I felt like this set is particularly sensitive to the quality of the input signal.  A very well encoded video looks great, but lesser bitrates really start to look fuzzy and full of artifacts more-so than I've noticed on other displays.  Perhaps this is actually a testament to the quality of this set, idk.Should anyone be wondering (as I was before purchasing) the analog audio output is pre-gain, meaning you need another way to control the volume of the audio that comes out of it (like a receiver).  I know this is not a normal thing to care about, but I am using self-powered studio monitors as my LR mains and if it were post-gain, I could have simplified the signal chain significantly.  There does not appear to be a menu setting anywhere to change this behavior.  Also, I'm not at all impressed with the quality of the DAC, so it's probably best that I get a receiver anyway.Overall, for what I paid during the Black Friday sale ($650) I think this TV is a good deal and meets my desire for a very barebones set with decent picture quality.  At $800 or whatever the set goes for normally, it might be worth shopping around more.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is a pretty good TV", "Author": "P.

Overall, the number of inputs/outputs were sufficient for us because we've got an A/V receiver that connects everything. I think the value for the money (screen size, 1080p, etc.) is really good.BUT....Our experience is that the factory settings for the picture are terrible and required considerable adjustment for us to be satisfied. We've got it everything adjusted now, which is why we're willing to give it 4 stars and not lower.Three things that were discovered while tinkering with all the picture settings seemed to make a significant difference:1. The factory settings really made everything look like a daytime soap opera in that the colors were washed out. What seemed to help was to set the whole picture to the \"Warm1\" in the \"picture options\" submenu. It also helped in the \"Advanced\" menu to turn the \"black tone\" to \"darker.\"2. The picture also seemed almost jumpy (like it was skipping almost) with the factory settings. At first, I thought it was the streaming video (i.e., a problem w/ our high speed internet) but DVDs had the same issue. What seemed to fix that was in the \"picture options\" menu, under \"auto motion plus\" was to switch that to \"Custom\" with Blur Reduction = 10 and Judder Reduction = 0.3. The adjustments made to the picture are specific to the particular input (e.g., you'll have to adjust for the TV, then the DVD, then other devices, etc.), so be sure to keep track of what you're doing that looks good. Maybe this is obvious to everyone else, but it took us a while to realize it.Hopefully this will save you a bit of time if you buy this product & don't like how the factory settings look on the picture.

Petersen", "ReviewID": "R27692APZ1KNHW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'll make this short as there's nothing much more to be said about this Samsung UN46EH6000 that hasn't already been stated.  It's a 'no frills' HDTV with an absolutely outstanding picture and its just what we wanted as we're not into all of the gadgetry of wireless, 3D etc.  I have only one problem with the set and I'm hoping that Samsung tech. support can resolve it, and that is: I've attached a ZVOX 555 sound bar (highly recommended) to this TV.  But, when I went into the Samsung's setup and disabled it's internal speakers (in order to make best use of the sound bar) an annoying thing is now happening, which is, each time I use my  'Dish' universal remote to adjust the sound or mute the ZVOX, the Samsung receives the signal as well and, instead of ignoring it (because I've turned it's speakers off) it throws up a large box on it's screen warning me that it's speakers are turned off!  To make it worse, the box stays on the screen for several seconds.  And, for as much as I manipulate the sound, this has turned into a real issue.  I'll keep my fingers crossed that Samsung's tech. support can remedy this.  If any of you have experienced and resolved this, please tell me!  Otherwise, buy this set if you don't need bells, whistles and any more than 2 HDMI ports.Udate - May 25, 2013:  Again, this TV has a great picture but, I'm now forced to downgrade my rating from 5 to 1 star due to the following:  The issue that I described above (warning box on screen when adjusting the sound) has been completely ignored by Samsung's technical support group.  I've sent more than a dozen emails to them describing the problem over the last month.  From those, I received only one response and then..., nothing.  All of my subsequent emails were been ignored.  I'm concerned that Samsung does not understand that 'service after sale' is the cornerstone of any manufacturing corporations business plan.  I have no idea why they won't help me but, it is what it is.  I wrote a letter to the CEO of Samsung describing my problem and the lack of response from his company.  To date, I've received no response from that letter.  So, for now, I guess I have to put up with the problem.  My next TV?  Well, it won't be a Samsung.Update - June 1, 2013:  A week ago, I logged into the Samsung Web site and left a review of this TV.  The review mirrored my comments above.  Today, I got the following back from Samsung:\"Thanks for leaving a review. Unfortunately, your review did not meet our posting guidelines.  This may be because it contained references to other products; or to pricing, ordering, delivery or other customer service issues.\"So, it seems that Samsung can't allow objective and constructive criticisms of their products on their corporate Web site.  That's unfortunate.  But, it is in keeping with their culture of 'no service after sale' so, at least they're consistent.Update - June 14, 2013:  As I stated above in my May 25 update, I'd written a letter to the CEO of Samsung as I could not get any assistance through traditional methods.  Today, I received a call from \"Grace\" from \"Samsung Corporate\" who said she was in possession of my letter and wanted to know what she could do to help.  (Interesting what a letter to a CEO will accomplish.)  Interestingly, she also stated that she had copies of all of the emails I'd sent to Samsung via their customer help site.  She apologized for the fact that I'd not received replies (she actually suggested that they went into my email 'junk' folder) and asked if she could have technical support call me within the hour.  I agreed.Shortly, I received a call from (not one, but two) techs. who were interested in discussing my issue.  They agreed with my observations that, when this set (they said \"all their sets\") have their internal speakers shut off, any subsequent signal sent to the TV via a remote control to adjust volume or mute causes the TV to display a large \"NOT AVAILABLE\" pop-up banner on the screen.  The said they've had to do this because customers will turn off the speakers (forget that they've done so) and call Samsung to complain.  I said that I understood the issue however, I couldn't understand why they would inconvenience the majority of their customers because of a few with 'user' issues.  I said if they couldn't release on this \"NOT AVAILABLE\" pop-up banner, couldn't the same message be conveyed (to the user error group) via a very small and transparent message at the bottom of the screen as to why there was no sound?  They said they understood but, that change was out of their area of responsibility.Their suggestion to resolve my issue was to reprogram my 'Dish' remote so that the 'Aux' button would control only the sound bar volume and not the TV.  I told them that I'd thought of this alternative myself and, even though it was doable it's not as seamless as it could be and, to me, too fussy.So, I give them credit for calling me to discuss this design flaw but, I'm wondering why it took a letter to their CEO to make it happen.

Blu Rays on this TV are just astounding quality! With the whole setup, it is quite the experience. Netflix HD is a must have to enjoy this TV daily unless you want to pay quite a bit for Comcast HD. I find that standard def comcast does of course look rather bad on it, but it will look bad on any HD because it is Standard Definition Signal.The inputs are lacking, this is very true. That is why I went ahead and bought a receiver so that it could handle all of my inputs and adjust them as needed instead of relying on the limits of the TVs settings. When paired with a receiver, this TV as a display is just about perfect to my eyes. It came with no visual defects nor scuffs. It now rests firmly on my wall where it has been mounted for almost a year.

We have Roku (had to buy a new HD one) and all we ever use is Netflix, so why do we need Smart?  We don't.As to the limited inputs, again, we only need cable and Roku.  If we needed more (I might buy an Apple TV box later), they make switches for that.Set up was easy and quick.  I had been warned that I'd have to make major settings adjustments because (as people explained) \"they come from the factory set up for bright showrooms\".  Well, the first question the setup asked was \"Showroom or Home\" so that was a complete non-issue.  The most difficult part of this was getting it out of the box.  You need a screwdriver to put the base on and that's it.What really made me happy was the controls.  The basic functions for picture and sound settings are quickly available through a Tools button.

Seems these 6000 units are becoming scarce. I got to run through the settings of the 5000's to match the color and brightness of the 6000 (center display) and so real quick here's how these should essentially be set up:Mode: Movie*Backlight 10 for my 5000's and 16 for my 6000Contrast 100Brightness 50Sharpness 20Color 40Tint G50/R50Advanced:Color Space: AutoWhite Balance: 20,20,25,25,20,25 for the 5000's and 25,35,35,25,35,35 for the 6000.Gamma: 0Dynamic Contrast: OffBlack Tone: OffFlesh Tone: 0Motion Lighting: OffPicture Options:Color Tone: Warm2Size: Screen FitDigital Noise Filter: OffHDMI Black Level**: LowFilm Mode: OffAuto Motion Plus: OffLED Motion Plus: Off* Movie Mode, I don't know why anyone in their right mind would use any of the other modes, unless you want that ugly bluish tint associated with LCD displays. Movie Mode applies warmer, smoother and more natural looking contrast and tones, giving you a proper image.** HDMI Black Level should be set to Low. This drops the black to practically zero, so that black backgrounds on the screen won't be glowing blackish-grey. I assume the LEDs turn off to achieve this. I had an issue where the 6000 unit was greying out the option for me, so that it's blacks were not as black as the 5000's and the image didn't feel as deep as the other screens, not to mention when setting all three to a black background, the 6000 was a noticeable few shades lighter. I solved this by going into my graphics card pixel format (ATI Catalyst Control Center > My Digital Flat-Panels > Pixel Format) and choosing RGB 4:4:4 Full RGB. This made the black level option in the TV available and now all three displays match up perfectly.The auto-motion feature sounds like a nice must-have on paper, but I never use it. I could see the interpolation being nice for watching sports, but it makes everything else (TV shows, movies) look unnaturally smooth-- what they refer to in layman's terms as the 'soap opera effect'.I'm fairly confident in Samsung displays, seeing as how the 40\" LCD TV I bought my parents is doing just fine, after some 5 years of regular use.

The order was successfully completed by Amazon, but the TV we received had a visual defect in it. The screen was damaged during delivery. Amazon immediately exchanged the TV promptly and curtiously. Amazon assisted us beyond our expectations. The second TV we received (of equal or closest to the original value) worked great for about 3 months, just beyond the Amazon warranty. Two pixel dots appeared in the center of the screen, and a gray spot appeared near the top right of the screen. After speaking with a representative at the local electronic retail store, with his 8 years of experience selling TV's, we were informed that electronics sold during Black Friday sales are manufactured with lesser care. The representative said many TV's are returned during these periods with defects, more than any other time of year.Beware of buying Black Friday electronics online.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the family room", "Author": "John M.

Have all three consumer technologies they've used in the past decade: DLP, LCD & LED ....  and all three continue to provide great pictures ... in the case of the DLP, for over 10 years with zero problems.The latest is the 46\" LED I just installed. First, the packaging was great and it arrived at our front door in pristine condition in perfect shape.... no dings, scratches, etc. Perfect.Lightweight and soooooo easy to get going. The picture was great out of the box so I did no tweaking. I'm a \"tweaker\" so this is unusual .... oh, maybe I changed the mode on a couple of screens, but nothing major or unusual.I bought this particular Samsung model because of the sound quality over other models and manufacturers. This model is used in our bedroom and I didn't want to have to use a receiver and speaker set up because of both appearance and space considerations. The sound is excellent for what we need which is mostly news, sports and talk shows. Not what you'd likely want for 5.1 quality for movies , etc., but very good.The speakers fire back into the rear wall and give a nice quality when they bounce audio back into the room.We have Direct TV, so getting the \"Smart\" model of this was not needed. We can connect the DVR to our home wi-fi network and get all the content we want.So, if you want high quality, nice sound, light weight and a great picture, go with Samsung for sure and take a peek at this model.

Manufacturers use them to charge more as the basic technology is getting cheaper to produce, but they don't add nearly enough value to justify the cost: I don't like 3D at all, I get Smart features in other devices, I'm not wall-mounting, and it's the screen I'm staring at -- not the frame.Sidebar: LED was very important to me.

In short, this is a perfect TV for those who already have a SMART device (PS3, Wii, Apple TV, Roku, etc.).  There really is no reason to spend more money for a SMART TV if you have one of the above.The picture is absolutely amazing.  I upgraded from a 37 inch LG LCD to a 46 inch LED model and it is beautiful.  I didn't think I'd see as big a difference moving from LCD to LED and from 60hZ to 120hZ but I did.  Blu rays are stunning and vibrant.  TV shows are wonderful too.The set comes with tons of features for total user customization.  I went off of the settings of the helpful reviews and tweaked to my preference.  I'm overall very happy.  I have my sound system plugged into it (a newer Yamaha model) and I've had no issues with it.We've all heard of the 'soap opera' affect as a result of the fluid motion and after making the adjustments from the helpful reviews above I feel I have a perfect balance.  When the camera moves a lot it can feel a tad jerky at times but I think it is more of our eyes getting used to a more accurate viewing experience.  Also the screen is matte finish, but it had more of a sheen than my previous LG model.  Minor issues for me though.In terms of complaints, the only one I can think of is I wish the base allowed for a small swivel.  I've heard complaints about the # of HDMI ports (2) but for me with having a sound system control my AV it is a non issue and I went into the purchase knowing that.If you're in the market for a new TV and don't need the SMART apps and want Samsung quality, I will say the 46 inch version is wonderful.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best.", "Author": "np", "ReviewID": "R3QEK4656EU95T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture on this tv is as sharp as can be.

Same day visit to Best Buy and no one would help me. So I thought I would just read reviews and try Amazon.The unit arrived the next day as I used one day shipping. It was WELL packed for shipping as it was packed in another box with plenty of packaging around it. Very impressed and no damage.The picture is good. I wish it had more HDMI ports, but one for the cable box and one for the Apple TV. I guess if I needed another port, I would just get an HDMI switch.Audio is very good.

Payne", "ReviewID": "R2C2HRPPM7EBKF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ripped myself out of the 90s and upgraded from a CRT TV to this. I'm glad I did.One of the first things I noticed is blacks are truly black. The appearance of movies is much more dramatic, more like directors imagined, I imagine.The other thing I noticed is the higher definition results in a loss of some movie mystery; Motion Pictures become actors on a set with special effects. It's quite unsettling, but after a couple of weeks this effect wore off. When I go back to viewing the same media in standard def on the old CRT TV that now annoys me. There has been some chatter in reviews and bulletin boards about \"soap opera effect\" that I think refers to this. I haven't played with settings enough to know if this is alleviated through some other processing mode. But my brain has adjusted fine, so why bother?I did find that I had to upgrade other components besides my brain:My 4 year old \"upconverting 1080p standard def DVD player\" played standard def DVDs horribly. It wound up with the old TV in spare bedroom. A new Samsung blu-ray player made my old DVDs look much better and the blu-ray discs are not bad either :) Samsung BD-E5300 Blu-ray Disc Player (Black).My 1st generation Roku box would not process Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 signals from Netflix, so this had to go to the room of shame with the old TV, and this one took its place: Roku 2 XS 1080p Streaming PlayerBut then my older Sony receiver could not process anything but original Dolby Digital so it got banished to the shelf of shame in the basement along with the Sony VCR that went years ago. It got replaced with this: Onkyo HT-RC430 5.1-Channel Home Theater Receiver (Black).So the moral is, if you upgrade your TV chances are you'll follow it soon with other components. Beware.I also splurged and parked a Windows 8 PC next to the TV for those times when you really want to surf the web but don't want to sit in front of a computer monitor. It plays well with the TV too; the Samsung has settings to be computer compatible. (just don't try to make it a blu-ray media PC; that's not worth the effort, sigh).Oh and the TV's speakers do a fine job, plenty of volume, but a lot of bass overwhelms the cabinet's ability not to buzz; an external sound system / speakers are going to be needed except for \"casual\" viewing.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Non-Smart TV", "Author": "J-Bar", "ReviewID": "R29KSSMS3W1UKQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great HDTV if your looking for one without internet or fancy features.

You would be hard pressed to find ANY other set with a better picture quality.  This is the full monty, 1080 HD on an LED screen with 120hz refresh.  Very up to date technology and specifications, and it shows.  Sure, you can get a 240hz refresh now if  you're willing to pay more for it, but I'm not sure the difference between 120 and 240 can easily be seen on an everyday basis.  Now, could you spend 5 times more than this to buy a 60\" designer TV that'll put this one to shame on every level, including picture?  Yeah, I guess you could.  But in the normal world of $1,000 to $2,500 sets which most of us inhabit, this model, which is not even a full $K, holds its own against any competitive product.I use the Samsung in my basement, for xBox and some other stuff.  I have absolutely no need for the extra software and capabilities that bulk up its Samsung (and other brands) siblings to $1300 or more - smart TV, wifi TV, 3D TV.  I don't want a 3D TV set (not yet, anyway) and all the \"smart TV\" stuff seems extraneous.  Nearly everyone's got something hooked up to their computer that'll provide all the wifi/web/social networking functions, so what is the point of having them in the TV?  Personally, I'd rather have a clean TV without all that cr*p -- save the money, and keep the internal guts free of bloatware.And thus, we get to the crux of the matter.  If you, as I, see the TV as basically a monitor into which you'll plug some different content sources such as cable, xBox, disc players, etc., well, there is probably no equal to the Samsung for quality and price point.  If you want all the extra stuff -- smart TV stuff or 3D -- then this isn't the box for you.  Keep in mind those extras are not a \"few\" bucks - they add hundreds and hundreds of dollars to the purchase.My one complaint is that it really could've used another hdmi port or 2.  2 hdmi ports is disappointing.  I won't dock them a star for it, but I think it would've been better and made more sense to give us another couple of ports.The sound is surprisingly decent.  I am very picky about sound, and will soon supplement it with a full home theater audio system, but if I had to live with the stock internal sound system, I could do so.  It's really not bad, and someone without budget for a nice sound bar or other system could easily make do with the included audio components.  That said, of COURSE adding a nice sound bar will significantly improve the audio.The 46\" is a nice size.  We looked at the 55\" and decided we just didn't need it.  Maybe it'd have been different if this was the set in our main living room area.  The 46\" is not huge, but not small either.  Going with the 46\" saves a lot of money, and some space too, and is easy to move around and light-weighted.  There's no way I could've been happy with a 40\" or 42\" set.  The 46\" is a good mid-sized product.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very high quality", "Author": "tonopah1234", "ReviewID": "RA5LR2KJ46P1F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very high quality picture, and sound.

So, trying to swap my 2008 46\" Samsung (which has the faulty capacitors) with this model won't work, since I need 4 ports, not 2.The power cord's too short. There's no screen (that I've found, at least) which tells the current firmware revision. You have to download the latest off the Internet, load it into onto a USB drive, plug it in, then wait for the TV to tell you that your firmware is already up to date--all this to find out if your f/w is up to date.Once again, the antenna signal strength meter is buried I can't remember how many menus in the last place you'd look. And when you change channels, the meter goes away, and you have to push-push-push to get to it again. I'm supposed to use this?FYI...I just hooked up a Panasonic DMP-BDT20P blu-ray player, and it the screen gets shrunk width-wise to 4:9 no matter what I do on the blu-ray player.

The picture quality is very good AFTER some tweaking (note: you must, I repeat, MUST calibrate the picture on this TV or you will not be happy with it).  It's got all the basic features I could want without unnecessary stuff like 3D and smart features.  3D TV might be awesome in the future but right now the content just isn't there.  I looked at some \"smart\" TVs and their apps stink--much, much worse than what you can get with a Roku or Apple TV.I really liked the design of this TV as well. The slim bezel is great--very sleek and modern looking.  It is deeper than the super-slim models that are becoming all the rage. This is not an issue for me as I have in on the stand, but if you are looking to wall-mount your TV you may want to consider whether a slimmer TV is better for you.120 HZ is great. This TV handles motion pretty well, at least for my purposes (I am not a gamer, so I can't comment on that).  It's got a bunch of motion-smoothing features, but I ended up turning most of them off as they can make the picture look really weird.Sound is very good for an LED TV.  I'm planning on adding a soundbar at some point, but you can definitely get by with the TV speakers.The only downside to this TV is that I initially noticed some dark shadows around the corners during some scenes (especially when the screen was all one color).  I think this is called vignetting or shadowing, and from what I can gather it is prevalent on backlit TVs that aren't full array (full array TVs are much more expensive).  Edge-lit TVs don't usually have this issue but they can have a bunch of other issues instead. At any rate, either the shadowing/vignetting problem improved or I just got used to it, because I hardly notice it at all anymore.There are a few other models out there that you should consider if you're looking at this TV right now.  The ES6003 model seems to have similar technical specifications, but it is super-thin and edge-lit. It would probably look much better wall-mounted than the EH6000, but I didn't want an edge-lit TV (they seem to have more uniformity issues than backlit TVs).  The EH6030 model is supposed to be exactly the same as the EH6000, but with 3D. I almost went with the 6030 since the price was similar, but bottom-line I am just not interested in 3D and wanted to make sure I wasn't getting some gimicky lower-quality TV. I have no solid reason for thinking it's lower quality though, so I'd recommend considering the EH6030 as well as this TV.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV purchased for Black Friday!", "Author": "Gregory Haney", "ReviewID": "R3CROM5PQ3ICR8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a 42\" LG, and this TV is great out of the box, and fantastic after time spent adjusting the advanced picture settings!

I've only had it for a month or so, so I cannot speak to its longevity.  However, since it's a Samsung I'm told that likely will not be much of an issue.Here's what I can say:It was very simple to set up.  I did it on my own in my living room in about 20 minutes (although I didn't wall mount it or anything fancy like that).  It arrived intact, no damage or defects that I could detect.The picture is absolutely gorgeous.  I had an Insignia 32\" 1080p LCD TV prior to this one and there is just no comparison.  TV was meant to be watched on a screen like this.  The LED backlight probably helps a ton, but the colors are vibrant and the contrast is superb.  One thing I will mention is that the 120Hz refresh rate definitely takes some getting used to.  At first everything looks like you're watching a soap opera, which can be a little unsettling.  It mostly just makes it look like what you're watching is actually in the room with you, like if you were watching real life through a window.  I'm already getting used to it and think I will eventually like it a lot, but I can understand that many people might be put off by it.  If you think you might be one of those people, then be careful, because as far as I can tell there is no way to adjust to a lower rate, like 60Hz.  I thought it would be permitted, but there's no mention of it in the manual and nothing in the menus.One complaint I do have is that it only has 2 HDMI ports.  This isn't a problem if all you have is a TV box and Blu Ray player, but if you want to connect things like a PC or console device in as well, you're going to have to play musical ports, which I've been doing with a laptop from time to time.  Not sure why they were skimpy on that.Overall I think it's an excellent TV.

But the one thing that you need to know about this TV, and about all Samsung TVs, is that they have an insane, inexplicable design flaw: you can't manually add channels or navigate to a channel unless the autoprogram decides it's there. In my case that means that even though a TV located 50' away receives channels 29-1, 26-1 etc, because the Samsung's \"Auto Program\" didn't pick them up, I can't input them into the remote or navigate them to them with the Channel keys. (\"Add Channel\" works off the autoprogram, so you can't add channels onscreen, either.)If you had told me, before I purchased this Samsung, that a TV manufacturer would purposely design a TV with no way to manually select a channel, I wouldn't have believed it.If you're one of the 75% that has cable or dish, this will be, I think, no problem for you (though there may be other  ridiculous Samsung design flaws that I haven't discovered). But if you're an over-the-air guy like me, you're out of luck if you purchase this item.And, yes, I called Samsung, and also did the online chat. \"Patrick\" at Samsung confirmed that you don't program a Samsung TV, a Samsung TV programs what you watch. And I found via Google hundreds of people online posting about this problem...unfortunately, too late to get another brand.My strong advice: look at another brand.

This tv stays nice and lukewarm plus it's energy star certified so it uses minimal energy.  The only reason I am giving this tv 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the lack of inputs.  Im ok with the 2 hdmi inputs, but my older Samsung had 2 component and 2 composite and this one only has 1 component/composite input, so I had to buy an additional splitter plus cables to hook up some other a/v items where my older TV had inputs to spare.

They are difficult to read and don't contain exactly the same information as the PDFs, which are more complete and helpful.Next, the remote has the same layout as the D6000 but it's at least a third smaller, and the original wasn't large by any means.Next, there's no power light on the front bezel. Now a lot of people will say why do I need a power light on a device that's always on anyway. Well, on the D6000 it would blink when powered up to full operational mode (out of standby) and that was useful because you would know that the remote's signal hit its target. On this TV the power light is on the underside of the front bezel. You can only see its reflection, and that's only if it's mounted on a shiny surface in a dark room.Next, the stand is short and squat. You won't notice unless your previous stand positioned the TV in a certain space relative to that space's top-bottom and side-to-side boundaries like mine did.Other people have mentioned that the stand seems to tilt the TV ever so slightly forward. At first I didn't notice but then I put a carpenter's level on it. Yup, about five degrees, and it's not because I mis-assembled the base. You won't notice unless you look at it edgewise, but still, this is a high-end piece of electronic equipment. Is there some reason for this?The HDMI ports (all 2 of them) and the USB port are located on the right side, behind the bezel in a little recess. This might be handy for non-wall mounts. Why? If you don't have an AV receiver or a HDMI switch and you have more than 2 HDMI devices, you can make substitutions somewhat easier from the side than the back. For the same reason, if you have content on USB flash drives.Now it gets serious. My D6000 stand was rock solid. It was big, heavy and stable. The TV sat on it rock steady. If you nudged the TV's bezel forward or back, no movement at all. If you needed to rotate the TV on its base, you had to do it with purpose. This TV, the base is significantly less substantial. Worse, the TV rocks noticeably if disturbed, like a 50-pound child jumping from a chair to the floor. Worst of all, the base does not rotate -- meaning if you want to swing the TV in an arc to provide better viewing from a different angle, you've got to move the entire assembly -- base and TV.The TV is thicker front to back. My opening can accomodate it; yours might not.I paid a little less for this TV but I assumed that to be due to the vagaries of the market. I did not expect to get less. I would have gladly paid the same as a year ago had I been assured of the same quality. Then again, the half-gallon container of ice cream no longer exists; it's some few ounces short but the price is the same. The same is true for a lot of products -- they mess with the value equation, hoping we won't notice. I hate that.Not Amazon though. I freakin' LOVE Amazon. I haven't even called them yet to return this TV but I know when I do I won't get any gruff about the return or the re-order. I'm a Prime member, an Audible member, and if I buy online, I look at Amazon first. It it's cheaper somewhere else then it's got to be substanstially so to offset the peace of mind in dealing with Amazon.

I cannot speak for everyone, but my Samsung has been anything but reliable.  It seems to have many of the same problem other buyers of Samsung TVs have experienced as I read other reviewers of Samsung TVs.  My problems are as follows:  1.  Turns off and on by itself.  2.  Completely switches off and will not come back on.  When this happens I have to disconnect power  from the TV between 5 to 30 minutes to get it to work again.  3.  Aspect ratio randomly changes.  4.  Input selection randomly changes.While reviewing possible replacements, I decided to read the reviews of current Samsung TVs and I learned that some of my problems with my current two year old set still has not been resolved by Samsung.  This is obviously unacceptable and I will purchase another brand.This is too bad since Samsung makes a wonderful TV when it works.  If you are considering purchasing a Samsung, I encourage you to read the reviews of others who have reported similar reliability problems that I have experienced.  What I find most telling is that after two years, Samsung has not resolved these basic reliability issues.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD BUT......", "Author": "DENVER BILL", "ReviewID": "R2TMMRDXW8G26", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THE PICTURE IS VERY CRISP WITHOUT DISTORTION.
