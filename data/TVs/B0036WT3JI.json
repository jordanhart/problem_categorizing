So when it was time to get a flat screen for my bedroom (the old CRT just had to go), I went right to Samsung. My needs were 32 inches, 2 or more HDMI inputs, at least one analog composite input, at least one analog component input and a QAM tuner. I looked at a few models from other vendors (the usual suspects, Sony, Toshiba, Hitachi, etc., excluding Visio, not a chance that junk enters my home) and for the most part they were very similar in the features they offered. This model was a little better than some of the others in the same price/size range and it had some extra cool features (ability to display images from camera) and given my past experience with Samsung, I purchased this model.I mounted the TV to the wall (using a Cheetah) and cannot be more pleased. The QAM tuner found all of the cable channels that were available (although it would have been nice to just have it hunt for digital channels, I had to go back after the hunt and manually remove the analog junk). The other inputs worked as expected. The remote control is not bad but it lacks a button to turn Closed Captions on/off (you need to navigate the menus to turn on/off, what a hassle). Picture quality is great, and the sound is what you expect for built in speakers (not great, but sufficient)All of that said, I give this baby two thumbs up...", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Picture Quality; Very Good Value", "Author": "Jack Gadzala \"Jack\"", "ReviewID": "R3KOFLLUA2WPSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One month of viewing has reinforced my initial experience that this Samsung LN32C530 32-Inch 1080p is an outstanding LCD HDTV.  After researching Consumer Reports and several online ratings sites, the choice came down to the LG 32LH30 32-Inch 1080p and a comparable Vizio (also 32\" 1080p).  Both the other two were less expensive, but the research suggested that the Samsung quality and features would be worth it.  It was correct.  The picture quality is outstanding, viewing the TV off-angle only results in a minimal brightness reduction (less than I've typically noticed in other LCDs).  Sound is fine (I use the TV speakers - not a home theater system for this TV).

Quinsland", "ReviewID": "RJLKYRWY7OJSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV a little over a month ago, and have not once regretted the purchase. Before this TV I had a 32 inch Sony KDL-V32XBR1 for over 5 years, and finally decided now was going to be the time to get my own as I am moving out of my house. I did some research and found that Samsung was definitely in the lead in terms of quality and price, and finally settled on this model. I got it for 499 on sale at Best Buy, and the difference was incredible! This monitor is BEAUTIFUL, especially for 500 bucks! You might want to do a little tweaking with the color settings, but it usually does a very good job looking great without any help from you. I have HD Cable, a Xbox 360 hooked up via Component, and a PS3 hooked up with HDMI. The TV automatically senses which ports are active and only switches between the ones that have an incoming signal going to them, which is really convenient. It also has a power setting which defaults to on which will detect the ambient light and lower the back-lighting on the monitor to save power. I personally found that it lowered the light too much, as I like my movies bright and colorful, so I ended up turning it off, which I would recommend to anyone who doesn't mind spending a little extra power on their picture.IMPORTANT NOTE: I originally had a hard time with ghosting showing up on bluray like another reviewer, but it just didn't make sense and unlike the other reviewer, after a little research I found that Digital Noise Reduction filters cause all the ghosting with HDTV's these days, so once I turned that off in the TV's menu, everything was back to being incredibly sharp and quick! Just make sure to turn that off when gaming or watching High Def movies, and you will NEVER look back on getting this TV. It has an incredible amount of BANG for the buck.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nothing but problems with this one...", "Author": "A. Garcia", "ReviewID": "R3N18S51P43YFF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was very excited about this purchase, the price point is great and it is a Samsung. The first shipment got here quickly and I was happy to set it up. As soon as I turned on my PS3 I noticed the left speaker (they are hidden by the way, which looks great!) would go in and out. I tried many different input devices and the sound problem continued so I knew it was the TV.I sent it back (Amazon was great by the way) and got a replacement... no sound issues. I thought it was a simple mistake and I was unfortunate and happily set up the new one. Later that night I was watching a BD and noticed the screen would darken and lighten about every ten seconds, over and over again. It continued to do this even as I turned the movie off and switched over to the X360. Called Samsung customer support and they basically told me I needed service, the nice lady then recommended (since it was only a day old and all) I simply return it to the place of purchase for a new one. Well after two tries and both being lemons right out of the box, I can't justify trying again. It's a shame because the picture quality is great, exactly what you would expect from a Samsung and it was really hard for me to have to move on for another brand. I still plan on purchasing a Samsung, but I won't lie and say this experience has made me very hesitant.Keep in mind, this is a very new model. I cannot recommend purchase of this set right now, but I'm sure in the future it will get a lot stronger. Furthermore, I could simply be extremely unlucky to get two lemons in a row.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Samsung LN32C530 TV has an important advantage", "Author": "William E.

We installed it in the bedroom, and it has a feature that is a big advantage for us: the \"timer on\" to wake us in the morning.  We use it as our alarm clock to awaken us.  Almost all TVs have a \"timer off\" feature or a \"sleep timer\", but Samsung is one of the few TV manufacturers who offer the \"timer on\" advantage.Also, I become amused by a review that complains that he had to put 4 screws into 4 screw holes to install the base.  Is he joking?  We installed the base and had it operational in about 10 minutes with no problems, and I am a senior citizen.This is my 2nd Samsung TV purchase this year, and they offer a superior picture at minimal price.Samsung LN32C530 32-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LCD HDTV (Black)", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased with the Samsung 530", "Author": "Malinda R", "ReviewID": "R5N6YPLCP6UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Third time's the charm. And am I glad I found this Samsung! I must admit purchasing at a local store but would have happily bought it from Amazon and saved money.Here's the deal; I wanted a 32\" HDTV for a spare bedroom in the 500 dollar range. First went with the Sony 32EX400. Now this may sound like a crazy reason for going with the Sony but I chose it because I discovered with my Dish Network remote control if you find the correct TV code, then the (*) asterisk button on lower left of the Dish's remote will activate the Sony's Sleep Timer. Hooked up the Sony to the HDMI from the Dish Receiver and there was a glitch where it says it cannot locate any HDMI device. Screen is black unless I unplug the HDMI then put back in. More issues with that Sony but long story short I took it back. The local store had received a new shipment of that Sony (and with different serial number series) so I risked trying the same model. Hooked the second one up and still had the HDMI issue. I wanted to make sure it wasn't on my end so I hooked up an HDTV from another bedroom: no problem, so I knew the Sony was going back and I'd go with a different brand. Did my online homework and this Samsung 530 seemed to fit the bill. Wow! What a difference between the Sony and this Samsung! I haven't even touched the Samsung to adjust contrast or color. The Sony was dim right out of the box on both sets I tried.Love the remote control on this Samsung. Nice big buttons and color coding is a plus for a bedroom TV. And it has a dedicated \"SLEEP\" timer button on the remote. No hunting through a menu. I've included a pic in the photo area.Tip for Dish Network users: If you program the Dish's remote control \"TV\" mode button to code 858, it will work like the Sony, allowing the (*) asterisk button to activate the \"Sleep Timer\". No more switching remotes to set the timer.I would recommend this set to anyone looking in this price range.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Problem right from startup", "Author": "Daniel Burgio", "ReviewID": "R2M1AVCB497SGD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It took a butt load of time and finagling to get the screws for the stand in.  Then, when I started the tv, I heard the sound flutter in the start-up jingle it plays.  I thought \"great, a problem from the get-go.  Maybe it will go away...\"  Well, it didn't.  The sound kept fluttering right until my last day with it, which would be the second.  I had to ship it back to Samsung to get it repaired (instead of having someone come out...)  Now I'm waiting for it to come back, which could be a month.  I already had to wait a week to get it, and then quite a while during the setup because of the screw problem, and now I have to wait for it to come back.  I paid quite a bit, albeit it with an amazon store card, to have it close to immediately.  Instead I had to go through the trouble of shipping the stupid thing away and now am waiting for who knows how long...  I realize that these things happen with electronics, but I have to give this current review based on what I got and will be updating it based on whatever I get back.*Update*I sent the tv in, waited a loooong time for them to repair it (they said they were waiting for a part to come in), and now that I have it back, I'm angrier than before.  The problem was kind-of-repaired.  The sound only flutters some of the time instead of always.  I wasn't entirely convinced that I was truly hearing it until a few minutes ago when the problem reared its ugly head briefly.  Now I'm not so sure I'm going to keep this piece of garbage.*Update...again*I sent the tv in a second time and got it back with the same problem.  I was told that there wasn't an issue with the tv either time I sent it for repairs (even though I was told the first time that the technicians were waiting for a part).  Now they want it back a third time so they can find what's wrong with it...  While I'm completely and utterly sure they will find what's wrong with it the third time, I'll be sending it back.  I'll probably be investing in a Sony or Panasonic in the future.*Final Update (I promise.)*I had to return it yesterday but before that, I took it to a friends house to see if it was just getting interference from the outlets in my apartment.  Unfortunately, the sound still acted up, albeit rarely.  It's a shame because I really did like this tv and didn't want to return it, but I just couldn't trust that the Samsung techs would fix it...  I want to get another Samsung, but I know that if it acts up, I'll have to put up with a lot of crap from customer service.  On a final note, I'm calling them tonight to cancel the repair request I made and they are going to feel my wrath... or at least hear it.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "A GREAT TV FOR THE PRICE", "Author": "Mark G.

Read time of HDD - There is a 10-20 second delay for the USB slot to detect the external hard drive. (This is also annoying)3. Darkening of screen - There are random flashes when the screen darkens for no reason whatsoever; I'm not sure if there is the TV's fault or the poor signal from the cable company.4. 60HZ refresh rate - I was hoping that this TV would have a 120 HZ refresh rate but there is a big jump of 100/200 dollars extra to get it included.Conclusion:The Pros outweigh the Cons so I would recommend this purchase if you have a strict budget of 500 dollars and want a 1080 p HDTV display.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Working great and I like it", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "RI58GNOZIAJC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased the LN32C530 for the living room a couple days ago and am loving it.Have not had any problems / noticed anything I don't like.Hooked up an Mac Mini to the HDMI port.

This is my second Samsung LCD (purchased a 40\" three years ago) and overall, I'm very satisfied with Samsung's quality, features and workmanship. For a second TV to have in the bedroom, I am very satisfied with the picture and sound quality, espacially after being connected to a HD cable box--you can't get any clearer of a picture than a Samsung! If there were one thing (and the only one I can think of) to criticize on this product it would be the ability to get the same viewing quality from side angles like my 40\" set offers (and I'm not sure if that diminishes as the TV gets smaller). If you are sitting in front of the TV your picture quality is 120%++ but when you try and view the TV from more than a 45 degree angle the picture quality is not as good as it is when viewing directly in front of the set. The one good thing is that the TV easily swivels to various angles with ease and this isn't a problem as long as you don't have the TV mounted flat against the wall.  Shipping was faster than expected and the only problem was that FEDEX left the TV leaning against the front door (since it's value was under $500) which is VERY scarey and if it was earlier in the day I might not have been so lucky!!!", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung 32\"  LN32C530", "Author": "B.

Over the past few months the situation has worsened and last night it turned itself off and on a total of 12 times in just under 6 minutes.  In researching this problem, I found that back in 2010 Samsung had a class action suit brought against them because of this issue.  It has something to do with blown capacitors in the power supply.  If your TV was manufactured from 2006- 2008, you were eligible to get the TV fixed for free. After 2008, you were out of luck.  My TV was manufactured in 2010.  Samsung customer service is awful.

After all, it still worked.  Then this last week it kept turning off and on again about 5 to 10 times a night and then last weekend, it wouldn't turn on at all.  It kept trying and played half the chime that it plays when it turns on normally and just kept cycling.  Some internet research revealed that this is a known problem with Samsung TVs.  Some guy filed a class action lawsuit back in 2010 and Samsung was made to replace the defective capacitors in the power supply.  However, they continued to produce the defective TVs which ARE NOT covered by this lawsuit.  Samsung even has a website dedicated to the settlement to let you know you are SOL.  [...] So, we would be out of luck except we used a Visa card which doubles the one year warranty.  It lasted about 20 months total.

At the time, I was very concerned with how it would fit in the location I needed.  I didn't have much space and was really worried about how the speakers would add to the size.  Many sets had side-mounted speakers and I got one with under-mounted speakers.  There was a big difference in quality as well.I look around now, and all the sets have tiny bezels with basically invisible speakers and the overall quality is much better.  What's left to pick?In my case, I still have a lot of non-HDMI equipment.  At the lower end, sets have more and more HDMI and less other connections.  Many sets only have one composite and one component input.This Samsung was pretty well rated, and it had 2 component and 2 composite inputs (but see below for more on that).  I think that I paid about $50 or $75 more than another model that should have been as good, but I save the hassle of needing to change plugs or buying extra equipment.  Good deal for me.The image is sharp and clear.  The ATSC tuner is able to bring in more channels than my 6-year-old viewsonic could.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have any type of \"channel add\" capability.  So when you rescan you potentially lose marginal stations.  Too bad, but that's apparently the norm at this end of the pricing.  Built-in audio is entirely adequate for my ears.Oddities:  While the specs on this unit are 2 composite and 2 component inputs, it's not obvious that you can't hook them all up at the same time.  One set of plugs on the unit is shared for both a composite and component input.  So you can either have 2 composite/1 component or 1 composite/2 component simultaneously, not all four.  I didn't expect that.Bezel is glossy black and the unit comes with a cleaning cloth for it.  It really picks up dust quickly.

Even the websites that list response time put \"N/A\" in that section. Do yourself a favor and make sure you know the response time of your TV before you buy it. If it doesn't list a response time, you're probably in for trouble.I also purchased the new 26\" UN26C4000 and that screen also had the same horrible ghosting... again, no response time listed anywhere that I could find.In conclusion, I was not happy with the performance of this TV. If you want to go ahead and order it anyway, that's your call, but I'm just putting the warning out that if you don't like ghosting or overdrive, do not buy this. You'll be disappointed. Note: I also saw a lot of ghosting in movies too.By the way, I know how to use the display settings on my PS3, so don't tell me that I have an issue with the PS3. I also have a 40\" Samsung that is 1080p and I have no issues with ghosting or anything.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is great!", "Author": "M.

It was easy to combine all components together and to set up TVs.If you consider LCD TVs having brand power, performance, and reliability, I can say that buy this product. Fantastic!The product shows all of cutting-edge-technologies which LCD TV can show us. The design and curvature are so great and nothing could be drawful. The weight is only 2/3 of other TVs.

The package was tight n nice. It's easy to assemble by myself. The TV was even bigger/nicer than I imagined.However, the power supply wire couldn't fit the TV set correctly, really bad connection. we had to touch it every 2 days to fix the power. So I wrote to Amazon asking for an exchange of the wire. I didn't want to replace the whole TV set, too much trouble to ship the TV back. They said the best way is to contact Samsung to solve the problem. I did so, multiple times. But Samsung service had never replied to me. I then wrote to Amazon and told them maybe the service people @ Samsung were all dead... It was a Friday and I didn't check my email over the weekend.On Monday my bf texted me at work asking why another TV arrived to the house. Amazon got me an replacement for my TV within no time. All I wanted was the wire. I then exchanged the wire and sent the new TV( with amazon return label) to UPS.Now problems solved. I'm not sure how much the TV costs on black Friday sale though.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung ln32c530 review", "Author": "Sandman", "ReviewID": "R1VZHG6B4H2SLN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very satisfied with Sansung HD LCD TV.
