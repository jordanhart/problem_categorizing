{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent TV - Amazing changes from 2010 line up", "Author": "Sony Reviewer", "ReviewID": "RL694WTTC59QC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all this TV has fantastic features. Until now most of the Sony TVs are matte finish screens which are non-reflective. Although Sony TVs are the best but when compared to Samsung, Sony has been lacking a little crispiness and black levels in the picture. Now Sony with this OptiContrast panel has overcome the shadow of Samsung in picture crispiness and black levels.The picture processing is amazing with brighter picture and excellent black levels. The black color is real black not blue black like before.I have connected regular DVD player and Blu-ray player to this TV. I have compared 1080/24P (Blu-ray) picture vs 1080/60P (DVD). I have done this test with the movies Inception, The Dark Night and Shrek.  The DVD picture quality almost matched with Blu-ray picture quality. Black levels, picture consistency and amazing crispness have been achieved through the OptiContrast panel and X-Reality Engine. Blu-ray movies are awesome with this TV but DVD movies are no less. You can rent DVDs from Redbox and enjoy the Blu-ray picture quality.When I connected the TV to regular DVD player in Standard Definition mode, the TV has automatically upgraded the picture. I had some doubts over the SD contents before buying, but this TV came up with better SD content and picture processing than previous TVs from Sony. When I have compared this with my other Samsung LED 46D8000 TV, I could see that Sony has bettered the SD picture processing. The TV upgrades the SD content to HD content level. This is the best part of this TV.Sony and Samsung have kept certain benchmarks (standards) for the TVs in their own path. Sony until 2010 did not venture into reflective screens where Samsung was outclassing the Sony's matte finish. With this NX720, HX820 and HX929 models Sony stepped into the reflective screens and achieved amazing black levels and brighter picture.Another advantage for this TV is Corning Gorilla Glass. At first when I knocked the NX720 screen hard with my side first, the picture bloomed and came back to normal. When I knocked on Samsung screen lightly with middle finger, the picture shook very wildly and it looked like it might break easily. Sony scores marks over the other TVs with the Corning Gorilla Glass. I have seen ads from Sony and Corning about the strength of the Gorilla Glass but still need to see the durability although the glass on the TV appears stronger. Someone really needs to try breaking this TV and see how much strong this screen is. :)I have tested the sound and the quality is good. One great thing about Sony is, it delivers 5.1 Channel Audio output. I have Comcast HD DVR cable connection. High Definition movies come up with 5.1 channel audio and this TV delivers exact replication. I have tested this with/without Home Theater connection. Still the sound is very good without the Home theater speakers. Another place where Sony scores marks over the rivals is it delivers 5.1 channel output through Optical Audio output. Other TVs deliver only 2 channel Audio through the Optical Audio output.If you are too much into technical specs, NX720 TV panel is 120Hz panel by default. HX820 and HX929 panels are much more better with 240Hz refresh rate. Do not be confused with the panel refresh rate with motion blur processing. Both are separate. As per my knowledge all the TV panels are 60Hz panels and 240Hz motion blur or flow processing is added to the TVs. Sony is coming with better panel refresh rates 120HZ and 240Hz. Added to it 240Hz or higher motion flow processing betters your TV. I am impressed with the NX720 motion blur processing. The motion blur is getting better and better. There are no artifacts noticed so far surrounding the images.The 3D picture conversion from 2D is very good. Still testing the feature with Blu-ray DVD but so far the conversion is at its best.The original 3D movies are the best to watch. Looks like Sony dealt with off-angle view issues. The 3D effect in the off-angle view is better than the previous TV line up. But if you sit in extreme angles like corner angles then the 3D view looked bit uncomfortable. For any 3D TV the off-angle view is a problem and this TV scores marks in this too.I tested the internet features. The internet content is good but there are lesser applications available for Sony when compared to Samsung. The Netflix and Youtube videos are very good to watch. We don't get the QWERTY remote like Samsung but you can handle this with media remote application from IPhone and Android phones.Not to mention the best gaming experience with PS3! Fantastic 3D gaming experience on this TV.This is definitely one of the best TVs with amazing crispy picture and better 3D processing.NX720 is a thin TV but still the bezel is bit bulky but I don't mind it because this is an amazing TV for my living room. I like the Samsung D8000 TV because it has very thin bezel. Hope Sony concentrates on this in future.Do not forget to update the firmware for NX720 model from Sony support or you can update it from the TV itself after you connect the TV to internet through WIFI. I did not test the Skype feature. It is cool to have it but I still use my computer or laptop for Skype. In future TVs should come up with Web Camera in built.I will update my review if I find anything significant good or bad about this TV other than I mentioned in this review. Bottom line is you won't be disappointed with this TV.I like both Sony and Samsung TVs. Both are the best in their own ways. I wish to share main differences after seeing both TVs closely. Picture, black levels and Edge LED local dimming are almost the same with minor differences.Only very few things separate them.1. Bezel - Sony has bit bulky bezel whereas Samsung has very thin Bezel. Thickness wise both are the same.2. Optical Audio output - Sony produces 5.1 channel. Samsung produces 2 channel.3. Corning Gorilla Glass - If it confirmed that Gorilla glass is really tough to break then your TV is much safer with Sony than Samsung.4. QWERTY keyboard remote for internet - Sony does not have one but you can manage with media remote application. Samsung delivers QWERTY keyboard remote which is bit difficult to pair up with the TV but works better after that.5. Internet Applications - Samsung has more applications than Sony at present. You can buy Sony Google Blu-ray player to have Android applications but it is still expensive.6. 3D Glasses - Samsung is venturing with Bluetooth capable which is better technology. Pairing might be somewhat difficult sometimes but once you establish it then it is the best.I might have missed somethings but these are noticeable differences between Sony and Samsung TV line up for 2011.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV with just a few flaws", "Author": "Chris Blount", "ReviewID": "RB3Q299LIHIYW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is replacing my 2 1/2 year old Samsung 61\" DLP. I wanted to get something thinner with no rear projection system and full HD 3D.Right out of the box, the picture is quite stunning. The colors are accurate and the contrast ratio is very good. As usual though with any \"default\" setting, the sharpness is up too high revealing digital artifacts with too much edge enhancement. A quick calibration with any calibration DVD or Blu-Ray takes care of these problems. I will say that I did not need to adjust the color and tint settings. They were spot on.When you first turn on the TV, you are presented with a series of screens to setup language, screen settings, network and other various options. It goes pretty quick. Nothing too difficult. If you use MAC security on your router, you will need to skip the network setup part and do it later since you will need to retrieve the MAC code from the network setup menus. Also, the internal WiFi adapter is 2.4 GHz only. It does not run at 5 GHz. You will need a separate adapter to do 5 GHz.Once I had everything setup, I did various tests from different sources. Satellite TV, Blu-Ray and online streaming from Netflix and YouTube. All looked excellent. As much as I'm not a big fan of \"Motionflow\" technology, this TV does it quite well so I might leave it turned on. Fast actions scenes with Motionflow look quite amazing.The anti-glare glass screen is the biggest surprise. Reflections are very subdued so if you have lots of light in the room, you won't have any problems seeing the picture.3D from true 3D sources work as expected. Things pop right out of the screen. The simulated 3D works just OK. Depth is not all that great. It's more of a novelty than anything else.The setup menus are very PS3'ish. Sort of the same design. If you have a PS3, you will be right at home when navigating the menus.Now a few of the flaws.1. When placing the TV on the included stand, its quite unstable. It seems that Sony was sort of lackluster when designing the stand. I guess they figure most people will mount the TV on the wall. In the documentation, it does mention a few ways to stabilize the TV but overall, it's probably not a good idea to use the stand especially if you have kids.2. The viewing angle quality could be a bit better. If you are right in front of the TV, the contrast and colors look wonderful. As soon as you stray a bit to the left, right, up or down, you begin to see some contrast issues especially in a dark room. Honestly, it's not a big deal but depending on the content you are watching, it could be a big problem for those sitting at an angle. I did notice that the TV automatically adjusts the picture depending on the light in the room to minimize the problem. Every LCD TV I own has this problem so it's really nothing new but Sony has done a pretty good job trying to keep it from being a huge issue.3. Since the screen is so flat, the hookups on the back have very thin clearance. If you have a HDMI cable with a thick outer shell on the connector, you might have a problem hooking it up. It took me a few minutes getting the HDMI cable just at the right angle so it would slip into the connector on the TV.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. Sony has basically done it again. The picture quality is very good. With all of the great features and built in internet access, you would be hard pressed to find anything better at this price point.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressive TV", "Author": "Mark Rush", "ReviewID": "R32HCGQK5HT3JY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, my son loaned me his 40 inch TV to take the place of my 5 year old 30 inch TV. I loved the bigger TV because it was so much easier on my aging eyes. I loved that bigger TV...for a solid 8 days, until it broke. I couldn't simply go back to my 30 incher, so I finally bit the bullet and purchased this TV. After watching it for a week or so, I am very glad I did so.The setup was reasonably easy and quick. The TV found my network and connected with no problems. The Internet setup of this TV is somewhat different than that of the Sony Blu-ray I purchased to accompany the TV. The Blu-ray allows me to easily access Amazon's free-to-Prime customers downloads of movies and TV shows. I haven't been able to figure out how to make the TV access as easy. Of course, I don't \"need\" the TV access because I have access via the Blu-ray player, but in some sense it would still be nice if I could use the TV itself for access. I don't (yet) subscribe to Netflex or similar services, so unfortunately I have no comment on their ease of use. Edited to add: After the TV updated itself (very easy!) it no longer was able to connect to the Internet. My computer-expert son had to manually connect it. If I was able to subtract a halof-star so that the rating was 4.5 stars, I would do so.The instruction book is on the skimpy side. Thankfully there is an \"i-manual\" on the TV itself, which is handy. Still, I guess I'd have liked more detail in the print manual, especially about issues such as setting up Internet access. On the plus side, the TV just finished up-dating its software with no glitches, so I know that my Internet access is at least semi OK.The picture on the TV seems significantly brighter than that on the old TVs. I like this feature. A feature that takes a bit more to get used to is how the TV handles scenes with rapid (or, even in some cases, not so rapid) motion. Often the people or objects seem to \"glide\" across the scene. It's hard to describe but I think that once you see it, you'll understand. Presently this effect is somewhat jarring, but as I've watched more on the TV, this effect has become somewhat less disconcerting. Perhaps ultimately I'll grow accustomed to it.The TV definitely runs much cooler than did my 5-year old 30 inch TV or, especially, the 4-year old 40 inch TV. I expect that this difference is due to the use of LCDs as the light source. Given that I live in Florida, this heat saving is hugely appreciated.One drawback is that the package did not include any 3-D glasses. Because I doubt I'll ever watch much (or any) 3-D at home, this point does not bother me.Amazon's delivery was first class. The TV even came a day earlier than initially promised. Of course, unless you live next door to me and get the same delivery person, your mileage may vary.Another huge advantage has been Amazon's low-price guarantee. Merely by checking on Amazon's web page, I have (so far) saved slightly more than $250 by submitting multiple \"found a lower price\" link to Amazon. Perhaps if I was more ambitious and looked at still more websites, I could save even more, but checking Amazon's alone is just so easy....EDIT: As I have gained experience with the TV, I'd subtract another half star (and be down to 4 stars) due to frustrating Internet access and even more annoying Sony help. At 12:00 noon today, the Internet access was fine. We watched a free-to-Amazon Prime customer TV show. But at 6:30, with absolutely no changes, it failed. After 30 minutes of repeatedly successfully connecting to my network and the Internet(at least according to the TV) and still being unable to access Amazon I decided to use the apparently helpful Sony help screen built into the TV. There was a nice 800 number, which I dialed...only to discover that 7:10PM Eastern time is \"after hours\" for Sony help and if I wanted to talk to someone, I had to call some other long-distance number. I decided I'd call tomorrow. I have my fingers crossed...", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony 55\"", "Author": "Paul T", "ReviewID": "RAT4BEUB7JY3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with my new television.  It has an excellent picture and the remote is easy to operate.  I have other Sony televisions and have never had a problem with any of them.  I am also pleased with purchasing the TV from Amazon.  I had previously purchased TV's for two or three online stores in the New York Area.  These companies immediately called and tried to sell me additional products and extended warranties.  I did not like their hard sell approach.  Buying from Amazon was much different.  Once I made the purchase there were no followup phone calls.  They kept me well informed till the product arrived.  I will continue to support Amazon with other purchases.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture but features are very disappointing", "Author": "K. R. Weiss", "ReviewID": "R29YZT8WH37CBE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research, I thought, before purchasing this unit. I had size limitations to fit into an existing cabinet so the newer slim bezel smart tvs in the 46 inch size were the largest I could go with.  Note to anyone who purchases a tv online - OPEN THE BOX WHEN THEY DELIVER!  The first unit that I received showed no signs on damage on the box.  I excitedly moved my old set, and unpacked the new one only to find that the screen was badly cracked.  Amazon was good about sending a replacement, but dropped the ball on arranging for the shipper to pick up the damaged unit when they delivered the replacement as the promised on the phone.  This resulted in me having to take more time to be at home to allow pick up of the damaged unit.  Somewhat disappointed with that - I expected the CS to be better on follow through.I was mainly comparing this and the upper level Samsungs.  3D is not overly important to me but I was intrigued and interested in the smart tv features - streaming netflix, streaming Amazon On Demand, Pandora, etc.  This was the main reason I choose to go with the higher end model that had wireless and these features.  Based on the idea of the unit becoming an efficient hub for those features.  Unfortunately this area is where this tv looses stars for my rating.  I am not a huge technophile or video junkie, but I know enough to be dangerous and wanted good quality and features.  The possibility exists that I am missing something in application or set up in the features that I cannot get to work - I actually hope so, but have no idea how to find out.First the Pros:- the unit is clean looking, light and was very easy to assemble and put in place.- hook up to Fios and my 5 year old Samsung DVD/receiver was easy- the unit recognized those components and through the HDMI control command provides control of the Samsung DVD player through the remote with no setup on my part.- The picture is great.  I have played around with the settings some and have been okay with some of the preset features on picture.- Price seemed very competitive to the upper level Samsung units when comparing features.- TV speakers are not bad.  More than adequate for average viewing.Now the Cons:After getting things set up I tried Pandora out.  Excited at the idea of having this play through my receiver and speakers.  Again based on my idea that this tv would work as a hub for all these cool new features.) Pandora works fine, but oddly the sound switches back to the TV speakers.  I play around and switch it to the external speakers.  The signal from the Fios box starts playing.  I turn off the Fios.  Now nothing comes out of the speakers.  After spending a while playing with settings and becoming frustrated, I called Sony support.  Only to be told that due to the fact that the set only has one output - the optical output - and something about the format of that output, none of the internet based content will be able to be played through the external speakers.  That OLDER models had an analog output that would let you do this, but NONE of the newer set have this.  That if I want to have those apps  play sound through my external speakers I will have to buy a receiver that will access the apps itself.I also tried hooking up an ipod through a cradle that I bought with a USB connection.  The TV recognizes that the ipod is there, but does not see any files.  I assume this is a file format problem.  But again it is a big disappointment.To me this is a HUGE HUGE disappointment.  This basically renders my choice to buy the higher level set BECAUSE of the these features as complete wrong.  As I stated, I am not a huge video or audio perfectionist.  But if I am listening to music - I want it to play through the stereo speakers - not the puny TV speakers.  If I am watching a movie, I want it to at least have the option of playing through the speakers.  I don't know if perhaps this is a software type thing that they can change in a firmware update, but it has me considering returning the set.  With this being the case, I might as well save money on the tv as it is STILL only an output display - despite all the misleading advertising to the contrary - and use the money I save to buy a dvd/bd/receiver unit that will connect to all of the internet applications.  I suspect that the picture quality would be the same or close to it.I am curious as to whether this problem is a Sony thing or if it is true of all brands selling \"smart TVs.\"  Not knowing that answer combined with the hassle of returning will probably keep me from returning the unit.  I will just suck it up and buy a receiver/dvd that does the internet stuff.  But overall this has really ruined my satisfaction with my purchase and I would not really recommend buying this level of TV, as there just doesn't seem to be much point.  Save the money and put it in the accessories that you will need to have all these features actually work the way anyone would expect them to work.11/1/11 Update:I believe that my problems with the sound may have been a bad cable.  However, I still have extreme disappointment in Sony tech support that they were completely inept and apparently gave me completely inaccurate information when I called.  In the end I ended up purchasing an Sony surround sound system/blue ray with the HDMI ARC capability.  Together the two systems seem to work fairly well, although there are some glitches that are a bit frustrating.  Not a big deal to me, but I dread calls from my wife if they were to happen while I was away.  The interface is not as seamless as it should be between the two Sony systems.I still stand by my earlier opinion that you would be better off to save money on the TV and plan to buy a sound/BR system with it.  The SMART tv features are somewhat disappointing on the TV.  The surround system I got has an Ipod dock and it works nicely.  I can play the internet streaming things through the tv on the Sony surround system without a problem.  But in hindsight, I truly believe I could have been just as happy with a tv a few levels lower (from a picture quality standpoint) and used that money on the surround system and saved $400.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Tv for the Price", "Author": "Wolfy", "ReviewID": "RH5UNV1M99TE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FYI, I purchased the 60\" from Amazon, not 46\" like it states above.  Also, still loving this tv, and use it mostly to watch tv/movies from my computer.After spending almost a year trying to rid myself of my monstrous 32\" CRT and researching new sets, I settled on this one.  My budget wasn't too rigid, so I considered most of the top of the line LED models from Samsung, Sony, & Panasonic.  Already having just upgraded my bedroom tv with a Panasonic LED, I knew a little about what I was looking for and what I really wanted to avoid this go around.  My requirements were few.  I wanted a 55\" LED tv with a terrific 2D picture, and with as little apparent QA or LED defects as possible (flashlighting, clouding, light bleed).The forerunners were Samsung's D8000 and pretty much all the Sony's, including the EX720, which has a semi-matte display.  I was a bit worried about reflections, so I thought the EX720 would be a better fit, and I really couldn't tell the difference between the EX and NX in the store.  After a whole lot of research and looking at tvs, I excluded Samsung for quite a few personal reasons.  I found the Samsung displays glossier and more reflective than Sony's, the colors seemed unnaturally saturated and excessively bright (at least in Vivid), & a sweeping number of QA & inconsistent production complaints, made me more than a bit apprehensive.  No one wants to be on the losing end of a display lottery.And even though I really couldn't tell the difference between the NX & EX in the store, I went with what countless experts and owners have consistently recommended (CNET's 2011 Editor's Choice award winner) .  I also considered the fully backlit HX929, but with its inflated price tag, and a number of complaints regarding panel defects, I ruled that one out as well.  I just didn't want to take the chance, and a 55\" tv really shouldn't cost that much, unless it's serving me dinner. Spending a number of weeks trying to get the best price in store or online, I was finally able to get a pretty decent price match  from Amazon.  And because after a year of looking at 55\" tv, the size started looking smaller and smaller, I decided to go with a 60\".  So I went from a 9yr old 32\" CRT to a 60\" LED.White glove delivery was okay, but it could have definitely gone a lot smoother.  Apparently, the delivery company only delivers to my town twice a week.  They of course balked when I mentioned the time/day I scheduled on Amazon's site, which obviously means nothing to some.  When they informed me of this, stated they wouldn't give me a scheduled time (they expected me to sit at home and wait all day), and suggested that I just come and get it myself, I was clearly baffled that Amazon would contract such a company, especially since they made it clear they don't usually deliver to my area.  And since I didn't have a car big enough or the man power to pick up that size tv, I had to find a way to talk the delivery company, into delivering the tv they were contracted to deliver.  Anyways, long story short, I had to talk to a few people to make it happen, and over a week after my scheduled date of delivery, I had my tv.My first impression of this tv, is its size.  The thing is huge.  Even bigger up close than in the store.  There was a bit of trouble assembling the stand, because the delivery guy first claimed to have done it countless times, only to find out that he had never put this particular tv stand together.  So after I took over the task of set up, everything seemed fine.  I was worried I would get a faulty stand, like others received, but mine turned out straight and solid, if not a bit weak for a tv of this size.  Pro/Con style for the remaining list of my impressions for this set:[...]Pro:No apparent issues, such as clouding, flashlighting, or light bleed, and my letter boxes are inky black.  One of the main reasons for going with this tv is its reliability and a consistent track record.  I didn't inadvertently enter a panel lottery and just get lucky.  I spent 2K and expect a certain level of QA, even with the inherent issues that come with buying an edge-lit LED.60\" Size (It's big, and maybe a little too big, I thought at first.  About double in size from my last set)Price (More bang for the buck, when compared to Samsung and Sony's HX models.  Especially when considering overall customer satisfaction and included features/PQ).Deep Inky Blacks (when calibrated, this set can rival some plasmas in that category.)BD/HD PQ (Incredible High Def picture), and the colors are extremely natural.Wireless Integration (Cool feature, if a bit  weak, and really not something I will ever use.  I'm glad I have it, but frankly if I started needing to connect, I would use a hard-line for faster speed.)Apps (lots of Apps to choose from, but again not something I need or want.  I already have plenty of other devices with all the same Apps.)The base is clean and sleek looking, if a bit dated.  The bezel is almost invisible when off, due to a single sheet of monolith glass covering both the bezel and display.Monolith Display (sexy as hell, and something I didn't think I cared about, but I love it and the reflections are really not that bad.  I have a 9 foot wide sliding balcony door that's adjacent, and I rarely notice reflections during the day.  My semi-matte had just as bad reflections, but they dispersed differently and more annoying I might add.)The Tuner isn't at all  bad (I get about the same or a little more channels, with the same over-the-air set-up I had before)._____________________________________________Con:Slow Menus (It's mostly an issue at start-up.  The menus are slow and clunky for the first couple of minutes, so impatient people may get annoyed)Less than stellar SD/DVD PQ (Not horrible, and I'm sure it has something to do with getting a 60\", instead of something smaller.  So those who go big, be forewarned.)The base I received wasn't defective, but it does seem a bit weak, for a tv of this size.  There is no tilt or right-left movement with the base that comes with the 60\".  I would understand the reasons for ommiting tilt, but being able to shift the tv right and left would have been benificial.Viewing Angle (A little washed out if viewed from the extreme side, but that's not an issue for me.)Sound (Obviously, this is a weakness that almost every super thin tv will suffer from.  It's simple physics, you can't get great sound with little room to move air.  I have a sound system, so it could come without sound and I wouldn't have cared.)HDMI issues with connecting my PC via a HDMI-DVI cable.  My tv kept dropping ARC and not detecting my AVR, every time I connected the cable.  It took me days of figuring this out and right before sending my AVR to the service center. I tried all the HDMI plugs on my tv and AVR with the same results.  When I disconnect, my ARC comes back.  I have no clue why this is or if it's  a compatibility issue.  Update below, problem fixed with new CPU.3D is definitely not this tv's strong point, however it was never a deciding factor for me.  More below.3D observations3D isn't awesome, but it isn't bad either.  I didn't buy this tv for its 3D and I knew its weaknesses going in, so I wasn't disappointed with this less than stellar feature.  I wasn't going to even try it, but I got curious a week into owning the tv, so I purchased a pair of PS3 3D glasses and a  copy of Journey to the Center of the Earth.  I didn't see much crosstalk, blurriness, or double images with this movie, and I didn't have trouble with the 3D disappearing, which is actually a product of the glasses you are using.  The picture looked in fact 3D, but I also did get a little motion sick, which  didn't occur while watching Avatar 3D in theaters.  No doubt, the 3D is much better on a 240hz tv, so go in that direction, if you are planning on taking advantage of this particular feature._______________In summary, I am very glad I ultimately decided on this tv and the 60\" size, which I'm quickly acclimating to.  The PQ and Black levels are incredible, given the right content, and acceptable when viewing SD/DVDs.  Overall, this has got to be one of the best bangs for your buck in LED for 2011.Update: It's been a couple of weeks and I'm still loving this tv.  Awesome 2D/HD and the colors are beautiful.  Regarding my issue with my tv dropping out of ARC, every time I connected to my CPU via HDMI-DVI cable, it turns out it was my CPU.  I finished building my first PC, and I didn't have the same issue when connecting to the new computer with the same cable and tv.My Settings:Setting Memory: [any]Picture Mode: Customize AnyBacklight: 4 (TV) 3 (Movies)Picture: 95Brightness: 50 (TV) 49 (Movies)Color: 50Hue: 0Color Temperature: Warm 2Sharpness: 20 (BD)/ 25-30 (TV/DVD) / 40-50 (PC)Noise Reduction: OffMPEG Noise Reduction: OffDot noise reduction: OffMotionflow: Off  (Note Below)CineMotion: Off-Advanced Settings submenu-Black Corrector: OffAdv.

Fritz", "ReviewID": "R10BOGCTYW2B4E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used this set for more than three months now. The picture is outstanding. Black level is outstanding. The TV can be set up for a very bright picture or a normal picture. The backlight settings are from minimum (0)through maximum (10). I use it at 7, the factory seting. Interestingly, at this setting, the tv uses between 35 and 52 Watts, depending on the scene on the TV. This is far less than the 182 Watts listed in the specifications. With the WiFi on, the power consumption increases by about 5 Watts. This is an incredibly energy efficient TV.Off axis viewing leaves a bit to be desired. Much beyond 45 degrees or so left or right (90 degrees total viewing angle), the picture begins to turn milky. Beyond 60 degrees in either direction (120 degree total viewing angle), it is bad. However, in my environment, that makes no difference with two chairs in front and a couch off to the side, the picture is excellent.There are a number of picture settings. I like it with most of the enhancements turned off. I recommend you experiment with one on at a time. Some are down right annoying with people seeming to be out of the scene. This not a negative comment. Set it up as you prefer.3D is OK. Yogi Bear was great. The main problem I see is where there is a bright image over a dark background. I can see two images faintly. Apparently, the 3D glasses still let through some of the previous frame's image. However, on normal scenes with the background and characters with nearly the same brightness, this is not apparent. This would not discourage me from making the purchase again. 3D is nice, but not perfect. I have seen no TVs that are any better; and this is one of the best for 3D.Regarding sound... It is acceptable. Volume is adequate. That is about all one could expect from speakers that do not face the viewer. Most TVs are coming that way now. For good sound, a home theater set up is a must. My preference is for shows with rockets and ray-guns. For normal TV shows, the Sony sound system is fine.I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again. It is the best TV I've seen in my investigations.The above is my review after owning it. Below was my first take on the TV while I was doing research.Since there are no reviews yet on the Internet for this new set, I visited our local TV store; and reviewed the 55\" version from top to bottom. I'm assuming the 60\" version is similar. I liked it so much, I ordered the 60\" one. I will do an update after mine arrives.Compared to the other sets in the showroom, from several manufacturers, including previous Sony models, the picture was the best by far. There was plenty of detail in the darker scenes, as well as in the brighter scenes. The picture clarity was outstanding with exceptional color accuracy. I saw no pixelization in rapidly changing scenes. The picture reminded me of a plasma display, which produces a much better picture than most LCD displays. I could not view the 3D feature (no glasses available and they are not included with the set), but it was very good in previous models. I expect it to be as good or better in this model. I could not review the sound as it was turned down on all sets. It does not matter to me as I will use my THX surround system for the sound.I noticed two things that could be improved: Although, background reflections from lights in the store were suppressed somewhat, it was not as good as other sets nearby. The off-axis light and color faded significantly when viewing from a slight angle from perpendicular. There is no way a reasonable picture can be viewed through the gorilla glass with a total viewing angle much more than 30 degrees off-axis (60 degrees total). The spec. is nearly 180 degrees. In reality, that is just not the case unless a dim, grayish image is OK at a steep angle. Since I will be viewing the image nearly direct on, it will not bother me.Power usage is significantly less than my rear projection 60\" HD set the new one will be replacing. The new set will not steal power when it is turned off.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hard to Beat", "Author": "Informed Shopper \"hal2007\"", "ReviewID": "R14FMIEAFSMZGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have only had the Sony KDL60NX720 about a week but we are pleased.  The picture is essentially perfect in both HD and in 3D.  So far we have only played one BluRay 3d Ultimate Wave Tahiti but it was excellent using both the Sony BR50 glasses and the Sony BR250.  We had a problem with a pair of 3D glasses from NGX that were supposed to work on Sony but did not and those are going back.  They were less money but absolutely just didn't work.  When the Sony glasses are turned on then WOW the picture in 3D is just excellent.  The Sony glasses are worth the extra money and the smaller Sony glasses can be worn by adults.  At this point our take on 3D in general is that it is way past the gimmick stage but it isn't something you want to watch for more than the length of a movie.  Your eyes tend to be scanning faster trying to pick out all the effects and everyone has remarked that their eyes feel tired.This is our first smart TV and there is a learning curve.  The TV is a bit more capable than we had realized and so getting through the I-Manual or owners manual which is stored on the TV is more of a challenge than just setting up a regular TV.  We have ours hard wired to the ethernet so we didn't use the wireless feature.  An example of the very sophisticated features on this TV that we had not realized are that if a child gets within 3' of the TV it turns off.  That feature can be turned off if you want.  Also the TV has a type of built in camera that records where you are sitting and makes adjustments to the picture to accomodate you.  We had not realized that and going through the set up we suddenly realized that in the lower right corner of the TV there we were.  Couldn't believe it so we both started waving to make sure that was us.  Yep.  So the technology built into this TV far exceeded our expectations.  We have made no adjustments to the factory settings for picture and simply use the Vivid setting which seems a bit brighter than our previous Sony.  We feed the TV a steady diet of DishNet HD and the picture tends to be perfect.  We were showing our Grandkids Gnomio and Juliet and the colors and detail were fascinating. DishNet sends a 1080i signal and the typical BluRay is 1080P.  Can't see much difference.Our TV sits in a very bright room during the daytime and while the picture is excellent there is a bit more glare off the screen than our older Sony which was about two years old and a EX5500 with a more matt finished screen. The gorilla glass is beautiful and shiny and I'm not about to test it for scratch resistance but it is very polished and with a window with sun coming through you will see more reflection.  At night that problem goes away.  Even in the daytime the picture itself is so stunning that you simply ignore any glare which in fairness is relatively small but reading the ads for gorilla glass I had expected no glare.The internet applications at this point seem more hype than reality.  The few times we have tried to get into it have failed and you miss a keyboard.  Our new Samsung BluRay player also has apps on it and that has been easier to use.  I am sure over time if it became something we wanted to explore more the internet application is something that we could get more used to. Pandora works very well and that would lead me to believe that the other apps would also.One more positive note.  The sound from the TV is much better than our older Sony.  Also we have run the fiber optical digital sound cable from the TV to our stereo receiver since it is an older Yamaha without the HDMI connections.  No echo and the sound is just excellent.  For normal viewing the TV sound alone is fine and then for a good movie we use the Yamaha receiver.  To get DTS sound when available we also have a optical line going from the BluRay player to the Yamaha receiver and then we turn the TV sound down.  At some point the Yamaha will die and we will replace it with another Yahaha with HDMI connections.  We also tried the headphone audio outlet on the TV and that is fine although the headphone outlet on the Yahaha is easier to use.Amazon did a fine job of getting this TV to us fast.  I notice that other sellers are available but we used Amazone which we tend to do whenever possible.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, but flawed for the unlucky", "Author": "Walter", "ReviewID": "R3EGMFQKUY3F00", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the 55-inch NX720 at noon on January 20th. Contrast, colors, brightness and blacks were phenomenal. Then the day grew dim, and soon I began to notice the light seeping through its pores. Faint, random patches of white all over the screen, and two 'flashlights' in each bottom corner, when showing a black image with small amounts of white. \"Unacceptable!\" I cried, thinking of the laughter such flaws would provoke when my plasma-owning friends came over, and promptly arranged for a return.The next day, I began to play around with the settings. I discovered that the flashlighting was most pronounced in Game mode, which I had set the TV to, as I primarily use it to view content on a PC or game console. Other modes, like Cinema, managed to subdue the effect almost entirely, leaving only slight traces of the corner flashlights when viewed in a darkened room. This was less unacceptable, but not by enough, since I demand a lag-free input experience.So I experimented with settings in Game mode some more, and managed to subdue most of the flashlighting by setting \"LED Dynamic Control\" to \"Standard\", and by re-enabling the Light Sensor, which adjusts the brightness based on ambient light. This makes the image rather dimmer, though not unacceptably so.After all this, I found myself hemming and hawing over whether to return the NX720 for, say, a plasma. But I chanced upon a forum post where someone claimed to have gone through three NX720s before finally receiving one without flashlighting. Aside from minor flaws like an unlit remote and wonky menus, this TV would be nearly perfect if it could sustain consistent blacks for a dark image, in Game mode, with the Light Sensor disabled.So now I await a second NX720, and hope the second, rather than the third or fourth time, will be the charm.Oh, and in case you're worried about potential glare from the glass screen, you probably needn't be, unless you set the TV flat on the floor with a skylight overhead, yourself suspended in midair with the noon sun at your back. With the sun shining through my window and a dark image on display, I could see the reflection of my legs if I looked for it. Apple could learn a thing or two from Sony about reducing the glare in its glass screens. Not even the CRTs of yore would have fared as well.UPDATE 01/27/12I've received a replacement NX720, which has less pronounced flashlighting/bleeding, but is still distracting. If you aren't planning on using this TV primarily in Game mode, then I wouldn't hesitate to get it, since these issues are absent for non-Game modes. For my purposes, however, I'll be trying out a Samsung PND7000 next. (Coincidentally, the PND7000 and NX720 were CNET's top plasma and LED of 2011. Their TV editor, David Katzmaier, prefers the PND7000 and plasmas generally, but recommends the NX720 for those who prefer LED.)", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Performance, Great Price", "Author": "jrmb", "ReviewID": "R2TZXBUF4RE931", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased four new tv's for my house, two Sony's and two Samsungs, so I can compare these TV's literally side by side.  The TV's I purchased are:1.  Sony Bravia XBR55HX929 LED LCD TV2.  Sony Bravia KDL46NX720 LED LCD TV3.  Samsung PN59D8000 Plasma TV4.  Samsung UN46D7000 LED LCD TVOut of all four, I would recommend the Sony KDL from a performance and price perspective.  The KDL was $1,200 as compared to the XBR at $2,699, and honestly most people won't be able to tell the difference between the two.  Save the money here.  But I love both of them.  I would recommend the Sony HTCT550W Sound Bar though, it makes a great step up in sound if you don't want to go the whole home theater route with speakers all over a room.I am less enthusiastic about the Samsungs.  The Samsung PN59D8000 went in my home theater room, and it does have a great picture and I love watching basketball games on it, but it does emit an audible buzzing noise, and it is really noticeable when you sit directly in front of the TV about ten feet out.  When the Home Theater guys got me set up, they said that was normal for a plasma to emit a low buzzing noise like that, and that it wasn't a defective tv.  I wasn't aware of that when I bought a plasma, so heads up.The worst tv on my list is the Samsung UN46D7000.  I wanted to like this tv, I really did, as it is a great looking tv with the clear bezel and sharp looking silver stand, but the performance is so far below the other tv's on this list it isn't funny.  Quite simply, it can't handle sports and fast motion without going blocky and an extreme amount of blurring.  And, the tv was $300 more than the Sony KDL46NX720.  Save $300 and go with the Sony, you'll be better off.  And yes, I spent one whole evening trying different calibrations from other user reviews to attempt to give my  tv different settings to help with the issue, but no luck.  I would not recommend this tv.Overall, since plasmas apparently emit a low buzzing noise, and the UN46D7000 has some severe performance issues, I would go with the Sonys.

I spent months researching TVs and I learned a lot by doing it. I was tossed between the Samsung and the Sony. What did it for me was my son-in-law bought us a Sony DVD Surround Sound System and due to compatibility I decided on the Sony and I'm glad I did.  I'm in awe of this TV. Everytime I watch a Hi-Def TV channel I just can't believe the picture quality!!  It is nothing less than STUNNING!!  Having a Sony DVD and TV allows us to use either remote to work the volume control.  If you have a different brand of sound system I don't know if that's possible.We are both over 65. I'm computer literate whereas my husband can barely figure out how to program our clock radio!!  I wanted a Tv that wouldn't be complicated for him and this Sony TV fits the bill.  It's very user friendly. There are still some things he can't do, but mainly due to his stubborness to learn new things!!We have a router two rooms away from the TV and yet we get a strong wireless signal using a cheap-O router.  We are so enjoying streaming video from Amazon. As a Prime Member we get a lot of video for free.  We just watched 3 seasons of Sons of Anarchy on Amazon and we only paid for Season 3.  One and Two were free.  We saw great moves for free too.  There are Widgets built into the TV for Netflix, HuluPlus, YouTube, etc.  But we're happy just using Amazon. (As an aside, I wish Amazon would offer a monthly subscription for their pay videos (like Netflix) insteading of paying for each separately, but there are enough \"free\" videos to keep you happy for a long time without paying a dime as long as you have a Prime membership.We are so happy with this TV.  We've had it for almost a month now.  We haven't used the 3D yet but sure we will sometime in the future.

I have explored the settings and other functions of the tv which is accessed via pushing the \"Home\" button on the (non-backlit remote), I have read other reviews that state the navigation of the tv's settings menu is cumbersome, however I found it quite easy and rather liked the look and feel of it. One thing I do like about the remote is that it has a concave sort of shape to the side with all the function buttons, but on the other side it is an almost carbon fiber look with just the sony logo and a round on/off button and four tiny 'feet' in the corners to help keep it up off the function buttons on the other side when sitting down on a table surface, this is cool because I have my tv hooked to a satellite receiver so most of time so the tv remote could be sitting upside down on the table and it only shows the nice looking carbon fiber design and the on/off button instead of all those different color buttons. small thing but neat.As far as how the tv's picture actually looks, I've heard that some people have said that the display contrast fades fast when looking at it from any angle off center, not me but I do have mine in the corner of the room and from any angle I can view this tv from it looks great. I also do not see any light bleed at all even when watching a movie that has the top and bottom black bars. Overall I am quite impressed with this tv, once I get into tuning the display it might even get better. There are some folks out there that have posted setting for getting the most out of the tv, which I will probably give them a try. As far as the 3D I haven't tried it yet as I haven't bought the 3D glasses yet as they do not come with the tv unless you get a bundle package. The sound has two settings if you are using the tv's internal speakers, one is if stand mount table top and the other is wall mount. Mine is on the stand and have been quite happy with the dynamic span of the sound, things like voices seems to come from the center of the tv (of course it doesn't but the illusion of it is quite good) where the subject is, other sounds like thunder and off scene sounds really sound like they are coming from another part of the room. Two things I have heard from other reviewers is that the sound isn't very loud and that the bass isn't very good. Both I sort of agree with however it seems like for the volume it depends on the channel or movie/show you are watching, they was a couple of shows that the volume needed to be turned up a little bit more but most of the time I have the volume under 50% or lower so no real complaints there, now for the lack of bass, it is a little lacking but again no complaints especially for a tv this thin, I think the sound overall is quite good for a tv this thin (which it is extremely thin!).The tv does seem a little wobbly on the stand but it is very secure and not going anywhere, the base and pedestal of the stand components are quite heavy and substantial. and the fact that the stand not only swivels but it tilts back a few degrees, this is great to help reduce glare which the tv has a little bit more than some other LCDs because of the glass, the fluid filled gorilla glass does do a pretty good job with glare reduction but it is glass, and that is were the tilt features comes in nicely, you can tilt the display back a 1/2 degree or so and for me all the glare disappears off the top of the display, the slight angle back is not noticeable at all when watching the tv.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia KDL55NX720", "Author": "TWM \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R2QMTK84DPX3RE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony BRAVIA KDL55NX720 55-inch 1080p 3D LED HDTV with Built-in WiFi, BlackWe had been holding off on the big TV - first, because we had a 10 year old Sony Wega that weighed close to 300 lbs to move out which would have been a royal pain due to a difficult and narrow door that almost made it impossible to bring in originally. Last year we renovated with a full 36\" door, so removed that hurdle. But then my wife got transferred to Norway for the better part of the year, so household upgrades were put on hold. In Norway, we had a 46\" LG in our apartment and decided it was time to get a new HD TV when we returned. My sister has an older Samsung and I was always impressed with it, and several other friends and relatives we know have Samsung or Sharp and they all seemed pretty nice. The LG we had was ok - but not overly impressive. So, upon our return, we did quite a bit of looking at TVs although the choices of places in our area are pretty limited - Sams Club, Sears and Best Buy are about it. The wait was worth it because LED types pricing dropped right into our budget range - at least if we stayed away from the very top of the line. Originally we planned for a 46\" but considering the size of our room and the fact that we gained about 18\" of depth compared to the old beast plus another foot moving the couch all the way back, we had a 14 ft viewing distance so the 55\" made a lot more sense. We were pretty well set on the Samsung until we saw the Sony at Best Buy and it just seemed to have a much more even image - no glaring spots stood out as too overly contrasty or what I felt looked like hot spots on bright white areas of the Samsung - it seems the edge light with local dimming made a bigger difference than we thought. Again. at Sams Club, the same held true - the Sony was a 2010 model but still the image just seemed more even overall - not overly contrasty anywhere - obviously we knew these TVs could have been setup differently but the richness and clarity of the images without excessively glaring whites on the Sony was the biggest thing that swung us from the Samsung. Price was also very attractive - Sams dropped the price to under $1600 probably because they were trying to clear out the last of the 201o's. Doing my due diligence price checking on-line, I found this 2011 model here on AMazon for just under $1650. The few extra enhancements seemed worth the small additional cost - actually less cost since I saved the gas of another trip and the sales tax. Well, we are completely thrilled. The old TV was donated to a family that lost all their electronics due to a lightning strike - easily moved out through the new door. The Amazon contract delivery was right on time - calling at least twice to arrange the delivery time and again an hour before arrival. My only complaint is they left the TV leaning up against the cabinet and would not wait the 10 minutes for me to assemble the base and assist me in lifting it onto the base. They said they were not allowed - just had to power it up to see it work. However, I did make them wait until I connected the cable and used the remote to make sure the image was normal and all things were working. So after cleaning up the mess they left of the packing materials, I got the TV fully set up and it was fantastic from the get go. Going for the 55\" was the best choice for us too - we have the perfect space for it. The only complaint I have is the speakers are not very good - some say due to the thinner depth of the LED TVs - but then Bose seems to do pretty good getting rich sound from small enclosures. No matter - I have an old 5.1 Yamaha and some decent speakers so the sound is great. Minor complaint is putting the connectors on the back off to one side rather than near the middle and having some connectors on the side that would be better on the back. The ambient sensor I had to disable since my center speaker temporarily sits in front of the TV and the base is not high enough to clear it - will be a non-issue once TV is wall mounted. The Internet wifi connected right off and has been no problem - I even setup the iphone remote app but generally just use the unified cable box remote. I'm still playing around with the scene/image settings so can't advise on the best - most things look fine using the default. For the motion settings, I find the default works perfectly fine, choosing the extra-smooth seems to dim the image too much. The default setting seems to be fine for baseball and football so far - we'll see about hockey soon. Overall we are thrilled and feel we made the best choice - I would recommend this model for anyone, especially at the price we got it - have not checked into the 3D yet - not a big attraction for us - we don't watch movies much - more into sports - of course your mileage may vary. But5 without going to a top of the line model for a lot more $$$ I find it hard to see any better.

Unlike others, I had no issues whatsoever connecting to Wifi, and all of the streaming services worked very well out of the box.  I am replacing a plasma with this set, so in terms of picture quality, I can rate it as good, but I continue to believe that if you want the best picture quality, plasma will be better than LCD/LED.  However, I really liked the features on this set, which were unavailable on any of the plasmas I was looking at, and there are other drawbacks to plasma including weight (at 60 inches, several competing units were more than 150 lbs - that's a lot to hang on a wall), burn in, dead pixels and fading blacks over a few years.  In the end, it's a trade off.  The picture quality of this TV is certainly impressive and bright, and to 99% of the people it will find it to be great, but for me, I can certainly notice some of the artifacts and pixelation that are common with LCD screens.  But as others have pointed out, it's probably one of the highest quality pictures of any LED on the market.The manual is lean and like many manuals, pretty much useless.  There is an on screen manual which is just ok, but it doesn't go deep enough into technical issues/questions that you are likely to have.  On the other hand, if you are prepared to set up a complex TV like this, you probably already know quite a bit about what you need to do, and the rest is fairly intuitive.  Basically, on one level, a single HDMI cable can get this TV up and running in a matter of minutes.  Hanging it and managing all of the sources through a centralized home theater receiver can take longer, and in my case, simply took a lot of fooling around.  I now have Netflix, Amazon Prime, cableTV, AppleTV and BluRay, all up and running.  The toughest part about setting up this TV was managing source confusion issues when using an HDMI switch (I am using my receiver as a switch).  If the TV does not sense a source, it quickly goes to blank and has a tough time recovering.  After a significant amount of trial and error, I was finally able to get the TV to seamlessly switch from one source to another.  Once that was taken care of, the TV is really fun.The remote control is very good.  I know others have complained about the lack of a backlight, but other than that, it is very intuitive and allows for simple navigation.  This TV is cable of doing a lot, and you can manage a lot of fine adjustments to sound and picture.  The TV would probably benefit from calibration.  I've made some adjustments but I have not used a DVD or BluRay disc for calibration yet.The connected TV features are excellent.  There are shortcuts for the mainstream services like Amazon Prime, Netflix and Pandora, but there is also a Yahoo widget app that allows for downloading of even more apps; and a Sony Internet area that allows access to more than a dozen additional video and music sources.  I wouldn't recommend using the TV for typical web surfing, Twitter or Facebook, but many of the content consumption applications are really good and the diversity of content is impressive.  Given that Sony does not just manufacture TVs but also owns a production studio (Sony Entertainment (formerly Columbia Pictures), I would expect more content updates over time.  HD sources on Netflix and Amazon look excellent.  I think they look better than Cablevision's signal.  That's crazy, but that's how bad Cablevision's signal is, and how good the stream is from Netflix and others.  Surround sound is possible for network videos but only if you connect an analog cable back to your receiver and convert the signal to Dolby Pro Logic (remember that?).  Believe it or not, it sounds great.  The speakers on the TV are ok, but if you are buying a 60 inch TV, it is being put in a room that will be too big for the TV's tiny speakers.I had an issue with the first unit that was shipped to me.  After set up, it went into a continuous reboot mode where I could not get the TV to turn back on.  We called Sony and they could not diagnose it and said it was a bad unit.  Luckily, I bought this at Amazon, and they replaced it no questions asked and I have a second unit up and running no problems.  I\"m really glad that I purchased from Amazon.  On reflection, I think Sony was wrong in their conclusion that the first set was a bad unit because I think the HDMI switching was causing the TV to reboot.  But I'm not sure, and the second tv is working fine.I have never been a fan of Sony.  I always thought Sony was low end, priced for high end.  I was very reluctant to buy this set.  But after using it for a few days and seeing all it is capable of, I'm very happy and impressed.  I hope that it lasts.  One final point is that all of these SmartTVs are really complex.  They are 60 inch computers.  As a result, setting them up to make use of all of these features can be daunting and even frustrating.  They don't use Windows or Mac OSX so the operating systems are proprietary and can feel unfamiliar.  If you don't want all of the SmartTV features I would suggest you buy a simpler panel.  But if you do want them, they are great, just be prepared to spend a little bit of time integrating them into your home set up.  Most people who are complaining about this set faced the same frustrations setting it up as I did.  It's the same as when you set up a new router or computer -- it can just be maddening.

I've had a month with this set and have to say this was a very,very good deal and I am happy with this investment. The picture is outstanding, the color and sharpness are amazing with excellent black levels. The gorilla glass looks amazing and covers the entire front way better than the matted screens and plastic trim on other TV's, very heavy because of the glass but that is a good thing but the stand I think is a little on the weak side but no problems with it yet and it does swivel for view adjustment and no backlight on the remote ( come on Sony you could of added that). This TV is also crazy thin I hope to put this up on a wall in the future, it has to be one of the thinnest TV's on the market today. It is a huge step up in technology from my Sharp LCD that is 5 years old. It connects to my receiver through ARC hdmi and I am now able to control sound through my receiver on or off with my cable box remote. The built in wireless lets me connect to the net included access to Netflix, Pandora and the cool 3D media ( the new Spiderman movie trailer in 3D is awesome) and other widgets that I haven't played with yet, it also lets me do system updates. It also includes sensors that warn you if the kids are too close by making a loud beep and a video camera for its built in motion sensors and a skype accessory (not included) for video chat that i don't really need. The 3D depends on the Blu-ray movie quality, Narnia had a lot of ghosting/crosstalk  which worried me about my purchase but after buying a few 3D movies and some IMAX blu-ray's (Deep Sea 3D, Hubble 3D and Tron 3D) I was in awe of the quality of the 3D only a very few times did I notice ghosting/crosstalk not like Narnia which was also a boring movie. It depends on the movie when it comes to 3D quality in my opinion. Deep Sea is a must have to see the potential of this TV. I will be hooking up my Xbox to play the new Batman game 3D this weekend and write a update on 3D gaming but Super Stardust HD on PS3 looks really good in 3D.

I went ahead and purchased the Sony. ( I almost switched to the Samsung when I went to pick it up) Once I got the TV hooked up and seen the picture quality, I thought I made a big mistake. I started playing with the picture adjustments (there are a bunch by the way) and could not get the picture anywhere close to the quality of my old Samsung.

I found lots of different opinions on what others did to help the picture quality but they didn't work for me. I then remembered reading previously online about a problem someone was having with there new TV and they ended up turning off the light sensor that adjusts the picture darkness to the room lighting. I went ahead and turned off the light sensor and WOW, what a difference. The picture now had the \"POP\" that I was looking for. I like a brighter picture and even in a brightly lit room, the sensor kept the screen too dark. Now if I watch this Sony for a while and then go look at my Samsung (Hooked up in mancave), there is no comparison. The Sony wins hands down.

The brief summary is, despite doing a lot of research it exceeds my expectations.To me it was a value vs performance decision. Yes there are better TVs, like the Sony HX929, but at that time the largest model of those was the 55 inch one and more expensive. And of course then there are the just newly released Sharp ELITE TVs, probably the best TVs money can buy, but also at least twice as expensive. Either way I opted for the NX720, because I think all this technology will be outdated in 3 years anyway and it is not worth spending the extra money. Save those extra few thousand dollars for the next TV in 3 years.So what did I get? Well this TV replaces a 3 year old 40\" Sony LCD flatpanel, so to me the 60 inches are plenty.Next the black levels. The HX929 differently than the NX720 has full array backlighting with local dimming LEDs, so of course the NX720 is not going to beat that. Still it is a huge step up from my previous TV and so good that I am very impressed. The NX720 uses local edge dimming and according to CNET reviews it is still among the best of the local edge dimming TVs. To also quote a salesperson from a local Sony store: He said he compared the NX720 and HX929 by standing them right next to each other, \"pixel by pixel\" and he just absolutely could not see a difference in picture quality. In summary, I am glad I did not spend the extra money for an HX929, just to get a smaller TV. The black levels are very good.The picture quality is great and with the 240 Hz refresh rate and the Motion Flow engine picture artifacts are a thing of the past, even fast animations are smooth. I say if you have 2500 to 3000 dollars to spend, depending on retailer I recommend taking a very close look at the NX720.Only possible catch is the 3D capability of the set. I personally do not care much about 3D and did not even buy the glasses, but heard this TV is not that strong when it comes to 3D. Might be true, might not. If you want good 3D capabilities, just do some more research, try it out in the local Sony store.About aesthetics, in my opinion this TV is the best looking one money can buy. It has a very elegant design and will add to your living room appearance. It looks great when running, just as it does when in standby.One more note, which should not influence you on your buying decision, but did surprise me. The 60 inch model might bevery slim and sleek, but it is very heavy.

Manufacture's warranty is gone, of course, and it is a pain to deal with Best Buy Geek Squad (whose warranty I purchased). I will update my review after Geeks will check my TV and tell me what the problem is, but for now, if the problem is mechanical, rating is 3 stars.Honestly, I would prefer a bit worse quality of picture if only this TV never broke...UPDATE:Geek squad confirmed my worst fears, it was the failure of the panel. I exchanged Sony for Samsung TV with similar features, and was shocked to see the difference. Everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING, starting from speed and 3D quality, is better in Samsung. I allow it could be that Samsung is a year older model, but at this point I will definitely choose Samsung brand in future (provided, of course that this one will not break down really soon).", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "so Pretty....", "Author": "mitzi421", "ReviewID": "R25OC0GF9DROHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Years later and I still love this TV....I am so glad I purchased it.

For real slow moving shows like documentaries, it is great. But anything that involves action, especially with the background panning, things start to get really blurry, really fast.

Once again, Sony has taken it to the next level.The Sony supplied remote control (RM-YD059) is not programmable.  For this kind of money, Sony should include a fully programmable learning remote to facilitate a home theater environment, but no.  There is a sizable remote after-market conspiracy.Price I paid in early April 2012 was $1,499 USD plus tax and free shipping. I purchased it from TigerDirect.com via Amazon.  Two days after my purchase,  I watched the price at Amazon-TigerDirect jump to $1,818 USD. For 30 plus years, Mitsubishi dominated the consumer Big-Screen market with its rear projection technology, but today it is Sony's market. The build quality and dynamic engineering is why you expect to pay a little more for a Sony.  In my opinion, if you bought a different brand, you missed it. I am a retired \"certified electronics technician\" who spent over 30 years in the A/V industry.  I am a very hard to please consumer when it comes to Audio Video.  This is the best television picture I have ever laid eyes upon. In many of the Blu-Ray signal fed scenes, you get the sensation you are actually standing there... it is that real. The combined technologies of local dimming, X-Reality Picture Engine and the Motionflow XR 240 gives a 1080p picture that will leave you breathless. This LED LCD-based Sony flat panel with local dimming was engineered  with the new Corning \"Gorilla Glass\", which reduces reflective glare. \"Gorilla Glass\" allows manufacturers to create slim LCD TVs with seamless, edge-to-edge fronts that make an elegant addition to any home d\u00e9cor. This unit also has a built-in camera located to the left of the SONY logo at the bottom edge center of the set.  The cam is not for usage with Skype or any other user applications.  It is featured in all the new Bravia units and is called \"Intelligent Presence Sensor\".  When activated it detects the viewer's face and respond in a variety of ways.  Additionally it alerts when someone, such a child, is too close to the set.  To me, the whole concept of what Sony calls... \"TV that watches out for you\", is big-brother creepy.  Here is more info about this from Sony and their engineers,[...]The in-out config/connects are more than ample for almost any equipment hookup preference. The hard-copy \"Setup Guide\" is sad, being skimpy and flimsy. In Sony's defense there is an on-board \"i-Manual\" as well as the downloadable (.pdf) guides from Sony.com.  The GUI (graphic utility interface) is very well laid out and provides intuitive ease. I will never utilize the 3-D imaging capability of this set so I will not comment on its performance.  I am not going to wear the goofy (powered) glasses which sell for a whopping $70 each.  I suspect that the current (state-of-the-art) 3-D technology is causing eye damage that won't be discovered for many years.  Sony does provide a warning for small children usage. I encountered no trouble installing the unit or performing an initial setup. I did purchase about 5 AmazonBasics HDMI v1.4 cables which helped with the hookup big-time.  The built-in \"ready to use\" WiFi is also very user friendly.  Neflix, Youtube, Hulu, Facebook, Amazon, Rovi, Crackle Skype, Pandora, Slacker and more, are only a click away.  The on-screen keyboard interface is kind of hokey and slow, but this proved to be only a minor inconvenience. I did about two weeks of research before placing my order.  I spent hours reading various owner manual details at Sony.com ensuring which model number had the performance and features I wanted.

The picture, its colors, and depth are incredible! I'd give it 6 stars if I could. The newer generation models from SONY look nowhere near as good as this particular 55\" LED. It looks super modern and squared. The front gorilla glass just adds a kick to make it look even better. If you're into iPads and other Apple products, shape-wise, this TV fits right in. THIS IS THE BEST LOOKING LED TV EVER PRODUCED, PERIOD. It's more than just a TV, it's a marvelous piece of furniture.In the last few years, I owned several Samsung LCD's and more recently a 7 series 55\" Samsung LED. None of these, not even the LED, can compare, let alone rival the SONY in overall picture quality and smoothness.So, take the few negative reviews here with a grain of salt. As with any TV, there are small imperfections with the early models. However, manufacturers always make revisions and improve on a given TV, which is why some folks experience issues that others - mostly in the later stage of production - do not. Case in point, I see none - and I emphasize NONE - of the bleeding or ghosting problems some people reported. Also, this TV works beautifully with my PS3. Both games and DVD/Blu-ray look breathtaking! I never once experienced a hiccup or flickering like I have with the Samsungs.True, it lacks some features and some of the apps look half ass. But it's not like the Samsung ones are any better!! People who complain about features, or lack thereof, should only comment if they owned a Samsung. Personally, I think too many folks are jumping on the wagon with new generation TV's with the expectation that it's going to magically replace their PC. It won't.

Luckily I had squaretrade and received a check for the amount I paid for it. I was curious about 3d technology but, at the same time hesitant.

A few months ago I picked up the playstation 3d monitor and after watching a few 3d blu rays and games I decided to give in and buy one for my living room. I must say this is by far the best tv I've ever owned or seen. The picture quality is amazing! After watching a 3d blu ray on this set I was convinced I made the right purchase. It was like nothing I've experienced before. 3d was alright on the 24\" but absolutely amazing on this one.

I'm upgrading from a Westinghouse LVM-37W3 which was one of the first flat screen televisions to actually have 1080p!  A couple of years ago a house cleaner wiped down the LCD screen with some solution and left a horrible streak on the screen.  I've been looking for a brilliant yet affordable HDTV ever since.  It took literally years of thinking I've found a good candidate before checking and seeing that the unit often had issues 6 months in or had a price not quite low enough for my tastes.I had my eye on this TV for a while, and I went to a brick-and-mortar store to check out the unit in-person next to HDTVs priced 2x-3x as much.  Although they all probably weren't calibrated correctly, the Sony really did shine there in the store next to the Samsungs and LGs.  With that in mind I just waited for the price to drop low enough from Amazon direct.  I highly recommend buying directly from Amazon if you can - it will save you so many headaches if anything goes wrong with the TV or you need to return the unit.It should be noted that the stand for this unit is a fairly simple mechanism, but does require assembly with an allen wrench and phillips-head screwdriver.  I hadn't expected this, but it really only delayed the full unboxing by about 10 minutes.  Once that was completed it took another 15 minutes of setting up wi-fi (very tedious due to a lack of qwerty remote), downloading a software update and then registering with sony and hulu to take advantage of a few of the key apps on the unit.  After the administrative setup was completed I was simply blown away.The black levels on this HDTV are insane.  You can't tell where the bezel ends and the screen begins in very dark scenes. I thought my Westinghouse HDTV stood the test of time fairly well, but the Sony really just is on a whole different playing field.  The pictures are crisp, and I mean CRISP.  I could see the pores on Larry David's face on HBO and it felt like Jon Stewart was in my room when I loaded up a Daily Show episode via Hulu Plus.  Seriously, this TV has chops.  The unit itself is beautiful in it's minimalistic design.  No gawdy silver or red, just simple black with the bare minimum of framing beyond the screen itself.  I can't wait to mount this thing.  The sound is fine, but seriously if you're spending this much on a TV and aren't buying at least a soundbar for added fidelity then that's your own fault.The only thing I can complain about was the delivery.  Scheduling the delivery was a breeze through the Amazon web interface.  The guy even showed up relatively on time!  The only thing that bugged me was that he immediately tried to get me to sign the form indicating the TV was 100% OK before it was even in the door.  I questioned him, saying \"Don't I need to make sure this thing works before I sign this?\", to which he replied that \"Well, I guess if you NEED to.\"  Dang straight I need to!  Luckily the TV was in seemingly great condition and booted up in short order.OVERALL:- Silky smooth picture with amazing black levels- Easy to access web apps that stream shows quickly and without loss of quality- OK sound (but you should be buying a soundbar to go with it)- Amazing price on Amazon (seems to be pretty volatile lately, so wait for a price drop from Amazon direct)", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "almost perfect", "Author": "Jim Feren", "ReviewID": "R1HHJUSZ7K7UHM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great TV and easy to set up.

I finally purchased the Sony 55NX72 from my local Sears at a great price.  I'm very pleased.  The viewing experience is different from a Samsung or LG which tends to be brighter, but Sony makes up with a picture that actually makes people look better.  I'm impressed with the warm colors and crisp definition.  One thing I am particularly ecstatic with is how Sony addresses letterbox bars.  They've produced an LED that does not have edge bleeding.  The blacks are really black. Set up was a breeze. Navigation for features is excellent.  The \"General\" setting is generally perfect for all video types.  Lastly, the bezel is stunning.

I think ALL the EX models chime when you turn them on.  Very easy to set up wirelessly.  I had no problems - I use Airport Extreme.  I selected \"scan\" and it scanned for my wireless network and it was REALLY easy to type in the WPA Key.  Just a super TV.  The picture is perfect.  Even when you look at it from the side.  The colors are nice and vivid and the picture is smooth.  Plus, the Sony brand really is the most energy efficient TV out there when you check Consumer Reports.  I didn't even need to use the user's manual to set up the channels and wireless, and I never had a wireless TV before.  But then I always use Sony for TV's and it's what I'm used to.  It's got the video adapter and I can plug in my DVR.  One person was missing his that came with his TV of the same model.  It's a BEAUTIFULLY designed TV, it doesn't have that ugly grey bottom like the EX models do.  It's nice and smooth and black all over.  I didn't get it for the 3D and couldn't care less about it.

I have also had a good experience with Sony products so was focused on getting a Sony TV. I have not been disappointed with this TV since I bought it about a month ago. I love the picture quality, although I will say I had to change some picture settings in order to get the picture that I was happy with compared to the out of the box settings. Sporting events look amazing as well as other HD television programs. I was concerned about it only being a 120 hz processor, but I don't think most people notice the difference between the 240hz and 120hz. The motion flow addition probably helps a little with this also.  Also, the screen size was more important to me and all the Sony TV's bigger than 55 inches and with 240 Hz processor or greater is like double the price of this TV. Although I have not checked out the 3D, I heard it might make a difference if you are concerned about high quality 3D output. I was not and just wanted to have the ability to watch 3D as more sporting events will have this option. I spent some time looking at Samsung TVs which are comparable to Sony,  but they were a lot more expensive as well as this TV seems to have less of the so called fake \"soap opera effect\" of the Samsung's I watched. Maybe they were on the wrong settings? Amazon's website had the best price.

However, when I finally got to researching the issue of OTA TV tuner use details such as channel additions (especially of interest to people using antennas with rotors and trying to access channels from several different compass points), I found that some manufacturers (from the brands that I was researching: Samsung and Panasonic) provide no means at all to add new channels to the existing list of channels (so for example, each time you turn your antenna and do a scan, channels previously stored in your list may be deleted if they are not strong enough to be picked up in the new antenna direction).So here are some specific notes on what you cannot do, and how to you would use the Sony NX-720 (and other models with the same menuing system with the \"Add Digital Channels\" option) for OTA reception:1) What You CANNOT DO On The SONY:  The ideal/best method for adding a new channel into your channel list would be to be able to enter in the channels RF channel number and have it found by the tuner if it were available [note that this requires that you know the actual \"RF\" channel number (not the \"Virtual channel\" number - e.g.: in my area, the local channel 11.x operates on RF channel 48.x).  I have a small screen portable Toshiba set (Model 15LV505-T) that allows you to do this, and it will then remember that channel in its channel list (I do not know if Toshiba's larger sets allow this).Another exact method of finding and adding a NEW channel to your existing channel list is to have a menu system that allows you to enter or search an \"RF\" channel for signals.  Many DTV convertor boxes have that feature.  In researching this feature (in the fall of 2011, by actually using the menu in a Best Buy store:), I saw that LGs HDTV sets have this menu feature built in (I later read in a forum that LG manufactured the \"Insignia\" DTV Convertor boxes, and can confirm that the menus are almost identical as I still have one of the Insignia convertor boxes).However, THE SONY TVs DO NOT HAVE OR SUPPORT EITHER OF THESE OPTIONS ABOVE.  If you try entering an RF frequency of a channel that is not currently in your channel list (with such a signal present), the set will display \"Cannot Decode Signal.\"  Oddly, it IS detecting the signal (if there is not a signal present, it simply displays no signal), but it is not able to display it without performing the ADC scan first, as below.2) HOW YOU DO ADD NEW CHANNELS TO THE EXISTING CHANNEL LIST.  The only way to do this is using the \"Add Digital Channels\" (ADC) (its a Scan) from the \"Channels & Inputs\" menu item.  Though the menu choice does not state it, this is a NON-DESRUCTIVE Scan that will only ADD any NEW channels found to the current total list of channels (NEW meaning that it will not re-add any channels previously stored in your channel list).(Usage note: before starting this ADC Scan, the info screen warns you that \"It may take 30+ minutes to add digital channels\"!  However, in my experience (only using an antenna connection) this scan has ALWAYS completed in less than 2 minutes (usually between 100 - 110 seconds).In Summary, while the Sony's method is not the easiest or most direct way to enter new channels, and it does take longer than entering a channel number directly, it is still a useable system for adding new channels or channels from various compass directions when using an antenna and rotor system.  After you have built your complete channel list, there's no reason to have to have to rescan unless you become aware of or want to check for new channels.  Without the ability to do this, someone using a set that only does a \"destructive\" scan (rebuilds the complete list all over again) would have to do such a scan every time you tried to access a channel from a different compass direction (and you can find user posts all over the various hdtv forums complaining about that problem).OTHER OTA TV RELATED NOTES:3) TUNER PERFORMANCE: While not related directly to the ADC issue, I have noted the built in Digital tuner pulls in signals as well as any of the better DTV Tuners (Converter boxes) that I have used.  It is difficult to compare directly since there is no Signal Level meter supplied on the Sony.  There is also an Analog tuner built into this model, so it is necessary to type in the \".1, .2\" etc. channel numbers (on most DTV converters you can press just \"2\" to get channel 2.1, etc. since they only tune the Digital channels).4) NO SIGNAL LEVEL / STRENGTH INDICATOR!", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV but...", "Author": "Tr3", "ReviewID": "R1JA1E0HQNTUUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was a good purchase. The TV was easy to set up and the HD picture is superb. Faces are great and details are crisp and clear. The only problems (why it isn't 5 stars) are for a TV at this price, you would expect better audio. But perhaps it is just too thin for good speakers. Also, as a 3D TV, they ought to include glasses as part of the package. But other than that, the delivery was actually early and watching sports and movies is more of a pleasure than ever. I happened to go to a friend's house who had just bought a Samsung 55 inch TV (240 hz refresh rate) at a slightly higher price. The Sony picture is definitely superior.

The TV is sleek, the gorilla glass is great and the picture is great once you get all the adjustments for HD and widescreen set correctly.  However, need to change that setting alot on the sony remote for old movies and shows that are not HD. Most new LCD's are similar in picture quality, especially if you adjust to vivid or photo settings for best backlighting and clarity.  Through a inexpensive audio cable converter, I did connect sound to my component stereo system, however, only 2 out of 4 speakers play and output shows it is MONO. First disapointment.  The internet features are weak... Sites that are free, are limited,  ex: to play music from one site, clic on one song at a time and not a big selection to choose from.  You have to register EACH internet feature online with all your personal info and password, then get a code from the tv and enter into the online site on your computer. (computer is upstairs, Tv is downstairs so up and down multiple times).  Most every feature will not activate unless you sign up for the monthly fee... even Hulu does not stream to TV for free.  Pandora won't set up, says the feature not available to register through TV and have to email Pandora for info, haven't received reply yet.  Paid big price for this model for all the internet features(plus had to buy a new N class router) and haven't been able to use anything but UTube to find a video, which is a slow process to key in the titles on the tv screen key pad, if you are not connected to an ipad or iphone. The other HUGE let down is viewing photos from flash drive or from computer(which does connect with router).  Any photo that has been edited on a computer will NOT OPEN. Contacted Sony, no insight, only \"can't play edited photos\".  This was one of the major features I wanted as a photographer and most photographers do edit to some extent if not all the time from RAW files.  Slideshow will not play without it stopping for any edited pic with black screen saying \"can't open this file\", and stops play altogether.  Also, won't open panoramas, sorts the photos to all horizontals and all verticals, and will not play in order of the original folder.  TV not great on the fast motion which I thought it would be with a 240 hrz, settings for each scene type(ie: movie,sports) doesn't do much.  Basically, all the features I wanted, do not work or not as simple as they advertise on TV info/specs.  Not worth the price for all the \"features\".

I thougt maybe I did not put it together correctly, but really it is only mounted to the base by three screws so I removed the screws and mounted it again, but it still was not completly straight.

In fact, if you are just talking picture quality in a bright scene looking straight on at the tv it looks very similar to the plasma picture.  the inky blacks and ncie color saturation and uniformity as well considering it's an edge lit LED.So bottom line:  If flashlighting bothers you a lot, get something else.

After going to big box stores to check out some offerings in person, I decided to order online as this will usually get you the best price for almost any purchase.  I experienced the plasma vs LED-LCD TV dilemma and ended up going with this LED TV.The black levels on this TV are absolutely great and nearly the darkest possible on an LED TV, which is something that plasma TVs are regarded as having an advantage of over brighter LED LCD panels.  Dark scene black levels are just about as dark as the black bezel on this TV and really make for great detail and contrast.  Out of the box the picture quality was good but I'd recommend playing with the settings to get a better picture quality as it can really make a difference.  I used some settings found on the AVS Forum NX720 owners thread and adjusted the ones that looked best to me slightly to my liking.  The results are blu ray and high def content streaming (like HD Netflix content) that looks amazing.  I have cable and the HD quality isn't amazing...but that is due to cable TV quality issues, not the TV's otherwise blu ray and high definition content from other sources wouldn't look so amazing.  I may switch providers eventually because of this.The extra content features like widgets and apps, I don't see myself using much at all aside from Netflix but they are there nonetheless and work okay.

Also used the Amazon price protection policy after about 1 week just by checking on changes from different amazon sellers. Delivery was 1 day later than scheduled- Amazon sends to a local freight shipper who delivers. I blame Amazon not the local shipper for the lateness because my unit left Amazon's facilities only the night before my scheduled delivery date. The local shipper (in san fran) was good with rescheduling as soon as they received my unit. Shipper took my unit up 3 floors and set it up and made sure it turned on.As far as the TV goes. A lot has been said on CNET and other similar reviews. This is top-class LED-LCD. Its not sony's top model but probably is it's best value from its 2011 line. Black levels are superb. Color required a little bit of tweaking but once I did that color was awesome. I've heard about some TVs needing a few days before you get just the right picture- not sure how true that it but I think that happened with my unit. Probably would recommend some kind of calibration tool or look up calibration tips online. My only picture complaint is that picture quality declines at off-angles (maybe at about 45 degrees off to the sides). Depending on your room shape and size this may make a difference or not.I bought this unit almost entirely for picture quality and not so much for features as I already have internet features from other devices (TiVo TCD746320 Premiere DVR, Black, xbox, sony BD player) Internet features are all right. Netflix and hulu plus are nice features. However, xbox interface for netflix is far superior (although sony has a better interface than tivo for netflix). Hulu Plus has the same interface as my Sony BD player (prefer the Tivo interface). Amazon Instant Video, Pandora round out the higher profile services and both work ok. Many other services included but haven't tried them all because honestly they seem like \"throw away\" features. A nice menu of 3D featurettes is included - nature clips, movie trailers and sports clips but nothing really substantial.Other complaint is that built-in sound is fairly \"canny.\" Not much of an issue for me as I routinely use my home theater system sound. Some nice automatic controls link the TV to audio receivers connected by HDMI. I thought this might be a Sony-only feature but this TV linked up with my Denon receiver nicely.3d features- Take a hard look if there's content you really want out there. You may decide 3D is not worth it.  Looking forward to Avatar being available by retail... Tried this unit out with the Sony 3DBNDL/HPOTER The Harry Potter 3D Starter Kit. Its nice to have but 3D really isn't all that compelling a feature. Also tried 3D gaming with Batman: Arkham City. I feel like the 3D effects aren't smooth enough for fast gaming yet. One note- I placed my xbox kinect right in front of my TV. Take a note that this blocks the IR 3D transmitter that you need for 3D.I very much like the styling of this unit.

The picture is bright with crisp blacks, and the menu / wi-fi functionality of the TV is first rate.  I have very little to add to most of the reviews on the TV so I will not repeat things for repetition's sake.  I do want to note in my review that I have concerns about the TV stand.  We do not have our TV mounted on the wall, so we elected to use the stand that came with the product.  It was easy to assemble and looks great when mounted and placed on a media console.  However, the entire length of the TV is supported only by a few screws on a central, 4 inch long steel pivot point, causing the TV to not feel stable at all.  Once mounted, I could touch the TV with one finger and make it bounce around like a teeter-totter.  All the screws are tight and there isn't a current risk that it will fall over, but it does not feel stable at all and it makes me want to keep an eye on the TV to make sure people don't bump into it.

It seemed to have the best value and to this very day although the Sharp is no longer a part of my apartment, I would still recommend them. The picture on the Sharp was excellent and sound was decent. However I was not happy with the unit due to some clouding in the upper left quadrant of the screen. Sharp being the reputable and honorable company that they are, asked what I would like to do about it putting the ball in my court. Being that i really liked the tv I asked for an exchange. The clouding was about the same as the first set they sent me, if not worse. I called back and again was offered a choice on what i wanted to do. By this time my patience was out. Returned the set for a full refund, and Sharp asked NO questions. What a great company!But, the review is about the Sony, so i thought the preliminary events leading up to its purchase were important. The 60 inch NX720 was heavily researched before I pulled the trigger. It seemed to have the least clouding issues in customer reviews that I read and this surely made me very excited. I really didn't like the clouding on the Sharp but I suppose it does not bother some folks. Not me, I couldn't live with it.The picture is like no other TV I have seen except top quality plasma screens that eat up much more juice and allegedly have much shorter life. Lucky for me I got a better job after I returned the Sharp so I was able to go up in cost. Let me tell you, couldn't be happier I did. The TV was around $1000 more than the Sharp which was quite a bit and I was a little on the fence at first but this proved to be the right decision in the purchase of a new TV. I haven't experimented with all of the features on the set yet, I am too busy enjoying the fabulous picture on movies and video games. Pay no mind to the 1 star votes who claim there is no AV connection. They are correct, but an adapter is included with the TV and should be inventoried upon delivery anyways. Clouding? Fear not, as this TV has a bare minimum of it. Not nearly as much as the Sharp and nearly flawless. My particular set seems to have a slightly brighter left side in some shots possibly having to do with the lights near the edge angled slightly off. Does this bother me? No, due to the drastic improvement I got from switching from the Sharp. It is as close to perfect as technology will allow at this point in time, and it is a breathtaking unit.Some rave about Samsung, and no wonder why because they too produce a beautiful picture. Many bad reviews on them as well due to screen uniformity issues especially on higher end models although a neighbor of mine has one that looks near perfect. But my final decision was on this Gem, and I do not regret that move.Bottom line here is if you have around $2500 to spend on a TV and you mean business, take a hard look at the NX720. I honestly don't think there is a better 60 inch LED screen for the money out there right now. Another thing. I found that the local stores charge over $3000 for this model plus you must pay sales tax. This makes me laugh. Amazon is quick and painless, hassle free in that I had to return my first NX720 upon delivery for screen damage. No problem, immediate refund and ordered a new 1. Excellent job with this unit, Sony.

The middle and lower area look OK in 3D with minimal crosstalk, but in the upper side of the screen there is absolute crosstalk, no 3D effect at all. This is more evident when looking at objects with good contrast that are meant to be distant or pop out of the screen. Pay attention to this if you own one of this TVs. Whether it be 3D games, bluray 3D, 3D internet/USB videos or 3D TV signal it's always the same. It's not an HDMI cable issue. It is useless to tweak the picture settings. The dejudder setting makes it even worst. Some other people reports the same issue but at the lower side of the screen. Stay away from this if you are looking for a 3D TV including the series EX72x which have the same problem but less pronounced. The picture quality is good, hence the single star.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Few good features and few not so good ones", "Author": "Ashwin Subrahmanya", "ReviewID": "R288VIOGB50OK6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the TV for about 1000$, but not through Amazon. Let me first start with things I like1) It has very good contrast. The black regions are very dark and this feature matters to how good a picture looks.2) It has tons of features, including motion detection, a webcam etc.3) It also has some 3D related features which I dont use (atleast right now)4) The TV looks good and is pretty thin. The audio is also not bad for a thin TV like this one.I have one big complaint . I am not sure if this is something specific to the TV or the source of the image. In some images, you see bands or shadow around images (images with bright colors). I have see this on my PC screen also, it could be possible that its a problem with synthesized images only. I also think that I see this mostly when I am viewing off-angle.Minor complaintsI dont think you can turn on subtitles on the Netflix App that comes with the TV.I dont know how the set of apps update itself or if there is a way to add new apps.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture Quality...Not the smartest", "Author": "javier inductivo", "ReviewID": "R3I4SMSXVUI9NC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As far as picture quality, I am very pleased with the set.
