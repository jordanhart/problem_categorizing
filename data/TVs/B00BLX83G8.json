{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Value and Great Performance with Configuration", "Author": "JES", "ReviewID": "R1RJRE8Y749TI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Haier 50 inch LED television is a bargain. It's performance should not be compared to another TV that has higher specifications, such as 120Hz refresh rate. I compared this unit to a LG 50 inch Plasma side-by-side in a store and I was surprised that I felt the Haier looked better because Plasma TVs have a reputation for rich picture. As far as picture quality is concerned, I did not find the out-of-the-box settings for my specific unit to be optimal. After about a day of tweaking the picture settings slightly as different face tones, etc. were displayed, I was able to establish an excellent picture--at least as good as a LG or Samsung LED TVs. My experience has been that the sound is not very good. However, turning off the Surround Sound setting improved it, as did increasing the bass level. When sound is important, I use my home theater surround sound. If you are concerned about the quality of the unit, get a service plan and you will still spend less than market leading brands and you'll have the security of repair/replacement in the event of a significant problem. I would rate this product a 5 if the sound were better.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing price and quick shipping.", "Author": "James Williams", "ReviewID": "R32JJJF9T2I830", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product arrived the date as stated on the estimated shipping.I quickly set up the TV and was unable to power the TV on with the remote. The remote was not working at all regardless to changing out the  batteries or doing the troubleshooting. Amazon, did offer to refund, or replace the item, which of both I declined. The quality so far is good, and the sound as well. I am a happy customer to be able to get a 50' for a cheap price, I had a TV that i was renting and paid, way over 600, and had to return it.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid TV. You get what you pay for", "Author": "CT", "ReviewID": "ROK12ZOTL6RO0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good TV for watching TV, but not good for video games. Sound is also not great. If you're just gonna be watching football it's a great tv, but if you'll be hooking up a ps3 or Xbox 360, pay a little more for a TV with a higher refresh rate.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good deal for the price", "Author": "ND Mike \"rabid1\"", "ReviewID": "R3OSUR8WC7EB1K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You will never get $2000 quality out of a $500 TV. if you can't figure that out before hand, don't buy.First once again QVC shipping was great. I got the TV 5 days before expected delivery.Out of the box. TV is light and only took about 10 minutes to set up. The picture is very good for the price. Compared to my Sony plasma  it's close. Not so good as my JVC DLP. The sound default is adequate but a little hollow.Like a lot of inexpensive electronics it takes some tweaking on your part. In video and audio, none of the presets are all that great. using the personal settings on video I was able to get really nice color. On sound I turned on surround and adjusted bass and treble manually. and it sounds pretty good now. Make sure if your dish or cable box uses auto leveling on the volume you keep it off on the TV.For $500 this is a great TV. For the price you'd be hard pressed to find much better.\"", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$829.99", "Features": "Integrated ATSC /NTSC /QAM tuners\nEnergy Star 5.3; RoHS compliant\nMultiple A/V inputs, including 2 HDMI and 1 USB port\nMusic and photo file playback via USB port\nHeadphone jack and coaxial output", "Name": "Haier 50-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV (LE50F2280)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51n%2BrGZ9C4L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BLX83G8"}}
