No response. Then tried calling support - had to leave a message.Days later after no response I called and transferred to sales - helpful guy and wanted all the details but again he could not help and would have tech support call me back - NO LUCK with call back3 weeks go by and now I am getting rather ticked at the no response. So rewrote email again - no response.Called tech support and left my number - no response.Again called sales and got another person.Got a live body - Yaaahoo! - could not help but forwarded me to customer service (to give me the service at home number). Customer service could not help and said Tech support were the ones to talk to. After an hour plus on hold I get to talk to a tech. 1/2 hour later he came to the conclusion that I needed service.The support issue is really bad. My recomendation is call them yourself before you buy the TV.Oh, and Good Luck!!!!", "Date": "January 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent LCD TV", "Author": "John F.

Not the best price I could find, but the store's only a mile from my house. This is a very good item. Probably the best deal for a TV/Monitor in this size. The picture quality is very good. I'm using it both as a TV and PC monitor. As a TV it's great. As a monitor it's good, at max resolution the picture is far from ideal, but it'll do. A small warning, while they do include a 6' VGA cable, they neglect to include an audio cable. You'll need to get a 3.5mm mini stereo type audio cable if you want to get sound from your PC. Other than that I'm satisfied with it so far.", "Date": "November 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Awsome TV, better than its predecessor", "Author": "roboman \"roboman\"", "ReviewID": "RNPK9IJ60RSS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quite an improvement in the picture quality compared to its older version LT20HVK model.

The \"ant\" input is horrible and will show every flaw in your cable connection. I did not see anything wrong with my tube TV until I replaced it with this one, then I immediately saw ghosts and noise. I ended up replacing my cable run to the bedroom with quad-shielded cable and upgraded my splitters from standard cable to the digital bandwidth variety which provided the increased bandwith that is necessary to provide the best possible digital cable reception (there's also splitters designed for HD as well). I cannot overstress the importance of making sure that your \"splitter\" matches your type of cable service (e.g., standard, digital or HD) to receive the best possible picture from your new set.  In addition, the viewing angles are extremely limited. You must be \"dead-on-center\" to get a good picture. Even the slightest deviation (from center) will \"wash-out\" the picture. In my case, that's not a problem because my TV is viewed from a fixed location in the bedroom and never have a need to look at it from an angle. And finally, this TV must be viewed from a reasonable distance to get a flaw-free picture (even with a pristine cable connection). From what I've read, LCD TVs are not as good at processing quick scene changes and sometimes the lag is noticable; however, at the proper viewing distance, those lags become tolerable. In my case, I had to push the new LCD TV back an additional 2 feet (from where I had my 19 inch tube set) to get those lags to a tolerable level. This TV has a 12ms response time and the better LCDs have an 8ms response time. I don't know if that makes a difference for TV reception but I do know that it will make a big difference if you attempt to use this as a PC monitor and one of your kids trys to play a top-end game. Also, I have heard that Olevia support is basically non-existant or difficult to reach so consider a supplemental warranty if available for a reasonable price. And finally, one of the most important pieces of information you'll need. To turn the TV \"on or off\" from your universal cable remote control, you can use the code for an LG brand TV which is \"0056.\"In summary, I can't make any final recommendations because I have no basis for comparison as this is my first-ever LCD TV. However, I can tell you that my wife \"loves it\" so I guess all the extra work \"paid-off\" in the end.", "Date": "September 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very good, not great", "Author": "M. L.

After a year of very light use, the unit lost 1200 pixels - \"stuck\" on purple all the time. Manufacturing problems can occur to an otherwise good product, but the true test of a company, in my opinion, is it willingness to stand behind their product and resolve their customer's issue.  This is especially true with a new brand which has not yet established a track record.  To date they have been unwilling to work with me, but I am hopeful we can work it out - I'll undate my review then.Techically, the contrast range of this LCD is not capable of showing both deep blacks and highlight detail at the same time.  This makes movie watching a poor experience, but I've found it suitable for general viewing, children's cartoons, etc.Of course, once you loose 1200 pixels, the picture quality doesn't matter that much and you can only hope the company will support you!", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "BEWARE!
