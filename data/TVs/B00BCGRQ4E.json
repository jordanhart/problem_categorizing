It has a unique and stylish look and the picture is great. This is my third Samsung TV. Typically I turn off the \"Auto Motion Plus\" setting because while Samsung claims this makes action less blurry I find it makes movies look more like they were shot on videotape rather than film.JB's review says he/she saw \"judder\" and in my experience the Auto Motion Plus causes this which is another reason I turn it off. Otherwise the factory settings out of the box looked pretty good to me - perhaps the contrast is a bit high (default setting is 100%) but that is easy to fix. Overall I highly recommend this TV. (BTW, I have not tested the 3D feature at all.)", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A smart TV that really is smart", "Author": "D.Frost \"movie maven\"", "ReviewID": "R2KR543Z4A25YM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I also own a 2012 Viera Smart TV and was never able to get any of the media player or network link functions to work properly.The Samsung also supports an external keyboard and a mouse unlike the Viera.With the Samsung it was a breeze to link to my PC hard drive where I store home videos and my photos.Samsung knows how to make software work and that makes this TV useful as a media player.The picture and sound are great right out f the box, however I do plan to add a sound bar to get decent bass.The energy usage is rated at 54 watts so that means this unit is very power efficient.Sometimes high tech design is not user friendly or ergonomic design. I find the touchpad remote control OK but irritating for channel changes. I do not want to draw numbers on a touchpad to change channels.  However my cable box has a regular numeric control that lets me change channels the old fashioned way.Overall this is a beautiful TV with a powerful media player capability.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN46F6800 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D Slim Smart LED HDTV", "Author": "Mr. Frank", "ReviewID": "R3LPWVH0UYS9RM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent TV, has great sharpness and colors are fantastic.

Could have been perfect.", "Author": "Tong", "ReviewID": "R13GREDIHPEOA5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is big but the stand is not as secure as it could have. I feel so uncomfortable having it stand on those tiny legs. The SmartTV works well as with any Samsung SmartTV. I like the looks of Plasma TVs better than LED; the faster refresh rate shows when playing games. But, I have no problems with this TV so I recommend it.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing! this TV rocks!", "Author": "Adol_Emmons", "ReviewID": "R2QBKXH0BGEI12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A smart TV that is really smart. I ouwned a Sony 40', but this is better. bigger, more brilliant, more sensitive, with the cam (not included) I can make video phone call through Skype, while I'm on my sofa and see my mom in the giant TV. Ammazing!! I saw a couple of movies on 3D with the lens!! a little unconmfortable but the viewing is great!!!, the sound is pretty good, but with addicional speakers is WOOOW!!...I did'n try it with 3d games yet, my son says that this is possible....The camera allow you tu use your hand like a pointer and closing it (making a fist) works like a click... so yo can navigate into this features...the remote does not have any 0-9 numbers, but it has a mouse-pad-like where yo can draw the channel number... (takes a little time to have practice)...also, you can tell the channels to the remote to control the TV...I feel glad with this TV.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picture is not great", "Author": "JB \"JB\"", "ReviewID": "R2HMJEIOFEC0B7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a un55es6500 which was a great TV.  No picture issues or motion blur. The tv was repaired 4 times. The tech could not fix the issue. Samsung swapped the TV with a new one from the 2013 lineup. The replacement closest to what I had was the un55f6400. Went to the store to look at it and it had a nice picture. When I called Samsung to get the replacement. They said they could upgrade me to the 6800 and it was a better tv. The specs are slightly better.  So I  agreed to get the 6800.  So far the screen has judder, blur, and I noticed motion blur in one scene while watching mission impossible ghost protocol. Switching tv to game mode resolves that but reduces image quality.Not happy with this tv.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1080p HDTV with Micro Dimming: Best picture quality\n120Hz Refresh Rate: Better for general viewing and good for video games, action movies, and sports\nSmart TV with Voice Control: Interact with streaming content and the web\nTV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 45.9 X 26.2 X 1.9 Inches, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 45.9 X 28.5 X 10.5 Inches", "Name": "Samsung UN50F6800 50-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D Slim Smart LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31PsvWKAS6L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BCGRQ4E"}}
