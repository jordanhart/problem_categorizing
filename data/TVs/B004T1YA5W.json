Better than my lg my Sony has it beat in that department. I bought one of these my mother has one and my best friend has one. I have had mine for over a year no problems and as far as I know nobody else has either. My only complaint....  not a complaint really, its the amount of hdmi hook ups this tv has only two. I would like three but again that's just nit picking! For half the price and equal quality you can't beat Vizio! I also think anyone who gave a bad review is nuts, I have friends like that if it's cheaper they look for anything they can find wrong, but try as they might Vizio makes a solid product!", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, but Back Panel Changed", "Author": "Michael Spiro", "ReviewID": "R3V2CVOJY3NQZC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this brand new Vizio E371VL 37\" HDTV at a local big-box store for $398. I did a lot of research before choosing this particular brand and model, and I think this was a great deal.  37\" is just the right size for our rather small family room where we do most of our watching (it's replacing a 20-year old 27\" Toshiba Tube TV!) I absolutely love the picture quality on the Vizio, and have done quite a bit of \"tweaking\" in the advanced settings to make it more to my own personal liking. Our Time-Warner Cable box puts out several dozen 1080i HD channels, and connected to the Vizio with an HDMI cable they all look simply stunning on this set.Now for the negatives:  The inputs and outputs on the back of my set are very different from the ones seen here on the Amazon photos, and seen on the display model in the store, and also different from the diagrams shown in the PDF manual for this model that I printed online (see the 2 images I uploaded above, and read the notes):1) There are no RCA analog left and right audio outputs to feed my stereo amp.  (Instead there is a single \"mini-plug\" output.)2) There are no separate \"AV\" analog inputs.  There is only one set of component analog inputs.3) One of the two HDMI inputs is now on the side of the TV instead of right below the one already on the back.All 3 of these things are pictured differently on page 14 of the manual, and were also on the display model in the store -- part of why I chose this model (yes, I stuck my head behind the set in the store to check out the back panel!)  Since I've always run my TV sound through my 30-year-old Marantz analog home stereo system, having variable analog outputs was a must-have item for me.  That \"mini-plug\" output does actually still work through my stereo with a mini-to-RCA Y-adapter ... but the tiny mini-plug is fragile and awkward.  I contacted Vizio technical support, and even sent them photos of my TV for proof.  What I was told is that Vizio released a different generation of this set, changing the inputs and outputs on the back without changing the actual model number!  To me that sounds like a real \"bait and switch\" situation!  I will probably keep the TV, since I've found work-arounds for these problems ... but I didn't like being surprised by this.  I almost chose a 40\" Sony Bravia for the same price, but eliminated it from consideration after a user review revealed that the analog audio outputs on that Bravia only put out a \"fixed\" signal, and could not be switched to \"variable\" so it could be controlled by the remote. That may seem like a trivial thing to some people, but things like that matter a great deal to me!The bottom line is that I still would recommend this Vizio E371VL ... but buyer beware of the changed inputs and outputs described here.  I would imagine all current models now have this newer configuration.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only lasts a little more than a year", "Author": "Drip56", "ReviewID": "R2THZFMJLZ3EEV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this set and it worked for about 15 months perfectly, then started have a few \"issues\" sound going off, etc but would reset.

I called Costco Concierge service, they tried one thing to trouble shoot which did not work. Then they patched me into Vizio and they just said we will schedule a repair. I spoke with a live person for only 2 minutes and the rest of the time, 45 minutes I was on hold. Come to find out many other Vizio TV's of this model have the same problem. Costco and Vizio should be ashamed for selling a defective product and so much for their so called \"2 year extended\" warranty. Costco/Vizio should admit this is a defective product and give the customer the option to get their money back or at the very least replace NOT repair this TV.

It was priced like the competitor tv's but I had heard good things about Vizio so we got it. I will never buy another Vizio product and here is why.The sound does not regulate no matter the settings. I have to change the audio settings to change between inputs for Blue ray, x box, DVD, cable, etc. to get the volume to be in a normal range and each channel has a different base volume to be able to hear.Picture quality is ok but the 1080 is not even a big deal below 42\".The customer service for Vizio when contacted about the problems is marginal at best and even when you do call during normal business hours many times you will just be disconnected before speaking with a representative.The TV also shuts off after so long but you never know when. The only good indicator is when the volume starts to go \"funny\" because I have had the volume go way up or off before this happens.Overall this poorly made tv is also not the most eye appealing. The Vizio that lights up draws attention away from the screen and the response time is rather slow.

After jumping through all their hoops (which we had already done because they are common sense) was told that electronics sometimes just die for no reason.  WHAT??????!?!?!?  After two years of light use?So I am guessing this is what they tell everyone who has this problem which seems to happen a good amount of the time (maybe not with the parental control beforehand, but a LOT of the tv not staying on) that sh*t just happens and you will have to just suck it up.

We went with Vizio because they make affordable, but still quality, HDTV's. This is our first HDTV and we love it. The picture is fantastic and we really don't notice the 60Hz refresh rate unless we are gawking at a new game we bought. Both Blu-Rays and games look amazing running in full 1080p resolution. A plus is that our LG Blu-Ray player's TV controls on the remote works with the TV, so we only have to use one remote while watching movies. The speakers sound great to have come with the TV out of the box. Most HDTV speakers are fairly weak. I would still suggest getting a sound bar for better, and louder, gaming and movie watching experiences.We bought it roughly 4 weeks ago for $358.00 from our local Walmart. This is significantly cheaper than what other retailers are selling it for. Neither me nor my wife notice the LED \"VIZIO\" logo that a lot of reviewers complain about. Its small and not very bright, so unless you're really picky it won't matter. One of the only serious complaints we have is that there are only 2 HDMI inputs on it, one on the back and one on the side. For this size there should be at least three, but its a minor complaint that can be solved with an adapter. One other major complaint is that the border around the screen is a high gloss finish, so unless you have a microfiber cloth it will get scratched while dusting it with anything else. Some may not think this is a major issue, but I'm O.C.D. about things being clean, neat, and organized and it scratched when we wiped it with both a rag and a paper towel.

Have people buy the TV for cheap and then it stops working 95 to 100 days later so their \"warranty\" is expired then you can pay them to have them fix it again.The worse part is Vizio can't fix it or replace it either because they don't recognize FiFe Store as a distributor.Very dissapointed and most Amazon Sellers are amazing!", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Something of a nuisance", "Author": "beverly fisher", "ReviewID": "R3N88BDXZ92JBR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it's not the television's fault but in my case, it's frustrating to muck about with new channel numbers to reach HD - which, in fact, does not appear all that unlike the analog picture.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "This tv is great ~ WHEN it works.", "Author": "Tiya Franklin", "ReviewID": "R1YOOXEBHN6X8Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had this tv for three months, then it refused to show anything but the vizio logo and wouldn't turn off until I unplugged it.

My only complaint is the screen catches a lot of glare, making it almost impossible to watch a show with a lamp behind the viewer. I've heard some TVs carry a special coating on the screen to prevent this, but this is not one of them. I've also noticed the one HDMI port is finnicky, as in every once in a while it won't transfer the sound from my laptop to the tv.

Then, we could have made an informed decision on our purchase.In our case, I had driven over 200 miles to help her get the t.v., and left my computer at home.  So, she ended up living with an aspect ratio that made everyone look fat for a few weeks.  Although I had set it to a different aspect ratio initially, she accidently changed it and didn't know how to change it back.  Didn't tell me this had happened.  Then she wanted to get rid of the whole thing.  I had to drive back with the manual, re-set the t.v., and go over the features with her---all of which I could have done intially had they included a manual.
