It actually takes a little bit of getting used to, since it is so much clearer and more 3D-ish than previous plasma screens.  But we really like the effect.We did have a minor issue when watching some broadcast movie channels that the picture seemed just a little bit \"jerky\", but we found a forum that talked about how some movies have a different transmission or screen refresh rate that result sin the timing being a little off, and suggested changing one picture setting on the TV.  we haven't had the problem since.I saw one review that said that the edges were darker than the middle on LED TVs of this size, but I haven't seen anything like that on ours.UPDATE 9/6: Yes, this TV is still incredible 2 months after purchase.  A user asked me what setting we were referring to that we changed in the above review: it was the auto motion plus in the \"picture\" menu.  Haven't had any problems or any jerky screens since.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great 60\" LED", "Author": "Manjinder Singh", "ReviewID": "RPQ3RB8N02Z3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great TV and got a great deal from Amazon. Now for the review only one problem I found with this TV so far is the light bleeding during a very dark scene or complete black screen this is an issue with a lot of edge lit led sets but i think a little more pronounced on this set. I did manage to set the TV so that this light bleeding is minimal please see my settings below.

Looks incredible on the wall. Minus one star for backlight issues.Check avsforum: many users, including myself, are a bit unhappy about what may be called flashlighting, or clouding. What may be an inherent problem with thin, edge-lit LCD's in general (worse as they get larger), the backlight is not of consistent brightness across the entire display. When the screen goes completely black, there is a sort of X pattern on the screen, which is slightly lighter than the rest, across the entire panel. It's only noticeable when fully black, or on credits, as far as I can tell right now. Overall it may be a reasonable tradeoff to have a thin screen, but one any buyer should be aware of up front, especially when they are not inexpensive.I also don't think the ambient light controls for backlighting work well enough. I have a lot of light in my room during the daytime, and I have to manually adjust the backlight up during the day, and back down at night.

I was really loving the sharp quattron in the store as this model wasnt available to see but the sharp was always a bit more on here. I know sharp tvs have had issues before and wasnt sold on the whole 4th color thing  so the timing was perfect when this samsung dropped drastically in price. I received this tv in 2 days of ordering and  one word HUGE.  this tv is huge and super thin. The sound is great and the picture quality through an hdmi  is top notch. I do agree with other reviewer  who needs the 3d hype  when you have picture quality this great.  no it doesnt have internet  but who goes online through their tv  thats what a computer is for.  bluerays on this tv  look superb  and you can really appreciate the quality.  Even regular tv looks great on this model.  the bezel is thin, the touch of color is just right  and for the money this in my opinion is the best 60 inch model out there right now.

Glad I bought the 60 inch, it looks and shows really great in our bedroom.. You must turn OFF the Auto-motion feature so that some movies won't appear a bit jerky... Overall VERY happy with our purchase and AMAZON had the best price plus free shipping... LOVIN it!!!!10/17/10 ~ ***UPDATE concerning \"Auto-Motion\" feature!***When I first saw a show with the \"Auto-Motion Plus\" turned ON and set at STANDARD ( default ), I was like, wait a minute, this looks kinda weird.. I was not use to seeing a picture with this much clarity, realism, and an almost 3-D look to it... So,, I turned the \"Auto-Motion Plus\" feature OFF.. Then later, I turned it back ON and also changed the the P (icture) MODE setting on the remote to DYMANIC, and watched Smallville. WOW!!!.. It really gave that show an incredibly LIVE appearance instead of a plain-ole' ONE dimensional movie appearance... Needless to say, I'm hooked on the \"Auto-Motion Plus\" feature.What some people are referring to as a \"Soap-Opera look\" is actually an almost Live 3-D appearance with extreme clarity when the \"Auto-Motion Plus\" feature is turned ON. This feature gives the highest picture, again, almost like 3-D!Occasionally, depending on how a show was recorded, it will have a slight JERKY-ness or \"skipping frames\" with the \"Auto-Motion Plus\" set on STANDARD.. So, tuning OFF this feature for that particular show will solve the problem of slight Jerky-ness.To change the setting or turn off the \"Auto-Motion Plus\" feature, simply go to MENU>MODE> scroll down to PICTURES OPTIONS>AUTO MOTION PLUS.I even watched an old Spider-Man 2 dvd with this feature turned on and set to STANDARD and Picture Mode set on DYNAMIC.. WOW!!,, It was like watching Spider-Man 2 for the first time all over again... The \"Auto-Motion Plus\" feature definitely gives NEW life and a NEW viewing experience to all of your non-Blue-ray DVD's... I highly recommend this TV for it's outstanding picture quality, it's many features and it's many adjustments to help you get just the right picture to suit your own taste!", "Date": "October 15,

has a 58 in plasma samsung, my parents have a 55in rca proscan 240 hz, have seen a few more lcd tvs in the last year, my mother in law has a 52 in sanyo, i thought my 52 in phillips was great, and it is a good tv, i paid a grand for it, good deal,now to this 60 in samsung led tv, i find it hard to believe there is a better tv out there then this, the picture is so surreal and crisp and clear, the colors are over the top, we compared it in the store before i bought on amazon and saved 600 bucks, we compared it with a 55 in sony led, we thought the samsung looked better, we have had the tv for around two weeks, and after playing with the settings i got the tv so my wife and i love it, unlike alot of sonys you have to set this tv for your taste, and its worth it, what sold me was the two year financing and the fact we keep our living room tv for at least ten years so i can't afford to make a mistake, and im am so happy with this tv, as far as the clouding issue one reviewer put down, that is the led lights and you can set the tv so there is no clouding, there is 4 modes, dynamic has no clouding, standard has some, natural is my setting and has very little, and movie mode which darkens the screen, its almost like watching a white movie screen, but its a black tv screen, all four modes have their own settings, so you can set each mode for the way you like to watch the picture, the picture is different then a lcd tv and that is a plus for the colors are so vivid its unreal, yet you feel as if you are watching the show or movie the way it actually is, very clear tv with many features, it handles low light movies so well, you can see the different shades of black, colorful movies like planet 51 look like 3d, everything just looks real, low light movies that go to high light are no problem for this tv, my settings i like the best are in natural, backlight 14, contrast 80, brightness 60, sharpness 60, color 70, in the picture options menu, my settings are, color tone, cool, hdmi black level is normal, film mode is auto 1, might give you a start then you can adjust for your own taste, i love the way peoples faces look, natural, i honestly have not seen every tv made, but out of the ones i have seen, this one is the best, my living room is pretty big, and this tv fits well, i would have gotten a 65 inch but they only have lcds in that size, watched some football and that is great also, no problems with the backlights being brighter in any areas, or no x on the black screen, my only cons is there seems to be no controls on the tv itself to turn it on and off, strange for if the remote goes ill have to unplug it until i get a new one, if there is one on the tv me or my wife can't find it, the other con is it ruins you when you see another tv, my 52 in phillips in the other room just pales in comparison, and when i go over to visit family all their tvs dont look nowhere near as good as they used to, my wife told me not to be a tv snob, and this tv wants to make you one, this is my first samsung tv and really didn't buy the fact so many people are saying they are the best, i'm not enough of an expert to say either way, but i can tell you this is the most amazing tv i've ever had or saw, led rules, thanks amazon for the 4 day delivery and to the other reviewer who helped me make a great decision to buy this tv, will be enjoying myself for a long time, it was well worth the extra money, i was waiting for the sharp 60in quad 240hz tv to come out, but seeing sharp in the store i noticed some grain in the gray colors, settings on the tv might have fixed that, i don't know, but after seeing this tv i had to have it and hope it lasts for years to come, some tips,the manual says you should try to fill the screen as much as possible to avoid ghosting, the good news is that when you fill the screen even with standard programs this tv does not have that mirrored effect on the edges i saw in other lcd tvs that i hate, widescreen movies look fantastic, the guide says watching 16/9 modes is the standard mode to watch, it says to avoid watching 4/3 mode too much which i don't use at all anyway, i have dvd recorders and some old movies and filling the screen with a movie that was not filmed in widescreen still looks great, good luck and hope i covered with enough information for you to make a decision...if i get any more tips or info i will update later, take care....update, as the other reviewer mentioned, the auto motion seems so far to have no use, since i have had no motion blur, i leave the setting off, also there is a 65 in samsung and i think it is an led, but at 4000 plus i'm glad i bought the 60 in and saved the money.....update, thanks to the last reviewer, and the instruction book, there are tv controls on the tv, bottom right on the front in light grey, can barely see them but they are there", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "UN60C6300", "Author": "B McStarr \"True Blue\"", "ReviewID":

big time compared to plasma, if you have any side viewing greater than 60 degrees the picture washes out, screen looks white with the colors fading out. I missed this at the store, also Tools say broadcast at 60Hrz for cable TV, so I'am not so sure about 120hrz improveing picture for cable TV, my computer also shows 60Hrz. DVD's are really eye poping good. I don't see any edge fade or lighting issues. The picture just takes a little time to get used to compared to plasma.

I did a side by side comparison with the Sharp Aquos, LG, and the Sony Bravia of the same size, and at all three stores, the picture on the Samsung superceded the competition in clarity, definition, & color. The only thing that I can't comment on is the expected longevity for this TV. I would speculate however, that the overall reliability of this TV would be comparable to all other Samsung products. The picture quality is so vivid, that even recorded shows from our satellite receiver, look like live broadcasts. I read a review that said the screen showed an X from the LED edgelighting.

It lasted for about 2 hours when an orange bar appeared on the left side and never went away. Defective. SO I returned it and ordered a 65\" Mitsubishi DLP hoping I would get a better picture than the previous Mitsubishi. Here's where I got disappointed. I got a slightly better picture but the blacks still had aftifacting and I noticed slight banding that I had with the previous Mits but figured it's 6 years later, there has to be something out there with nice smooth, dark blacks and a better picture. So I ordered the 60\" Samsung LED. I wanted the high end 3D ready but at almost $4,000 - $5,000, it was out of the question. Even paying $2500 for a 60\" non 3D LED was kinda pushing it. No 3D - at least this year. When the set arrived, I was astonished how thin it was - 1\" thin!! And it was an amazing picture right out of the box. TRULY AMAZING! I've heard others reviewers say almost \"3D like\" quality. (Yeah. Right.) But they were absolutely right. It's almost like you could reach into the TV and be part of the experience. Now, here's where it gets even more confusing. I watched a standard DVD from my PS3. It was so realistic it looked like it was shot on videotape. It was so clear and \"3D\" like, it was really hard to get use to. I can only compare it to like watching a daytime soap opera. I thought at first it was the DVD \"Life As We Know It\" maybe shot on videotape? So I put in another older standard DVD and the SAME THING! WAY TOO CLEAR!! Razor sharp, smooth quality. After a few hours, I finally accepted that \"THIS IS GOOD!\" As for Blu Rays - simply astonishing. This all may have something to do with the high speed HDMI cable I use from the receiver to the TV which converts it to 1080P. Watching regular TV is very very good but Time Warner does not broadcast in 1080P only 1080i. But the HD channels are still amazing. Since I'm 6 years behind technology it's my fault for not keeping up with what's out there. I'm looking forward to seeing what TVs will offer 6 years from now.

The picture quality on this thing is crazy.  I love it that we got this for the football season because the games are so fun to watch on this thing.  We have a bose system running for the surround sound as like most of these TV's the sound quality is not the greatest - but who cares the picture is perfect!!

The DVD picture is better than my previous Sony KDLXBR9's blu ray picture. I kid you not. I don't know where Samsung gets off saying that it has glare reduction, I don't really think it does but the screen is easy to clean where as my last one always seemed to leave streaks. Connectivity with my Sony amp and blu ray player isn't seemless but I wouldnt say its a problem either. Sometimes both volumes are on at the same time so I just turn down the tv's Also, when I adjust the volume through the amp both the tv and the amp fight for the graphic on the tv screen but once I adjust the volume to the level I want it I don't see it flashing from the samsung display back to the sony display, back to the samsung, ect. I called Samsung to turn off their graphic but they told me to call sony to turn off theirs (even though thats the audio I'm using, thanks a lot). Also, the remote is not a learning remote for the cable box but there I use the cable companies which is a learning remote. So if your wondering why I didn't give it 4 stars the picture is that good. Although I don't know where samsung is coming from in regards to connectivity for heavens sake.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture in HD, just alright in standard.", "Author": "ys", "ReviewID": "R1WVXVD45R2RLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my TV. Great picture in HD. I love the picture on the HD channels and blu-ray, but it is only so, so on the standard channels. It was easy enough to set up. I think because it's a large screen you notice the difference between the HD and the standard channels. I can still watch my small regular TV upstairs, but if I'm watching the 60\" I need to watch in HD. I did a lot of research and was having trouble deciding between this and the 60\" Sony. I have friends that have the Sony and the picture is also very good. I think the Sony may be better than the Samsung on the standard channels.

From beginning to end the representative (Michael in my case)was exceptional. Delivery was free and prompt. The tv is beautiful and best of all I got it for an incredible price. They beat out best buy by almost $500. I can't imagine looking anywhere else for any electonic product. After placing my order on line, I got a call from the representative who reviewed everything on my list. He made suggestions and saved me even more money when items which I had as individual came bundled. I was so pleased that I still call Michael when I have a question. The entire experience was 5+stars..You will not do any better anywhere.
