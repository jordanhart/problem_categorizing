{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing TV!!", "Author": "jjperron75", "ReviewID": "R114RLWNIEZIGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did a lot of research before buying this TV. I have always owned  LED/LCD TVs in the past and to be perfectly honest I was a Plasma hater and never thought I would own one. I originally was going to get theSamsung UN60ES8000 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D Slim LED HDTV (Silver). I along with a lot of others thought plasma was a step down. Boy was I wrong! This TV has the most amazing picture I have seen, and that right out of the box. I haven't even adjusted any settings yet. Some key things I was worried about when buying a plasma was that they always seemed so much darker than the LEDs, I believe it might be the was the stores display them because the TV in the store display was playing the Dark Night and it seemed very hard to see. However once I had them put in a different DVD the TV seemed extremely bright. I owned a 55 inch SAmsung LED prior and now seeing them side by side I can tell what I have been missing. First the colors are extremely clear and accurate, I noticed how washed out an LED TV picture is now. Also the motion blur I got from any fast moving things is not a factor on this plasma as it was on my last TV. If your a fan of 3D the 3D on this TV is great. No crosstalk like early 3D models.  I was also concerned about the glare, I have a sliding glass door in the room I have the TV as well as a bay window directly behind. Sure there is a little glare from the window but no more than I had with my LED, its just something that you have to deal with on any TV. This TV also has no issues viewing in the day time with the entire room lit up.Now for the Cons... the Smart TV features aren't quite as smart as they think they are. The voice control works surprisingly well unless you have the TV up loud then it has a difficult time hearing your voice. You can press a button on the remote and talk into the remote(there is a microphone on it)  which will work but if you have the remote in your hand already why not just push the button. I guess this is good for web browsing and being able to speak any text. The motion control on the other hand doesn't work so hot, I actually haven't even got it to understand I am waving at it and trying to use it. It seems to only attempt to work when the room is very bright. Voice good. Motion not so good.The only other Con which I guess is pretty common with a Plasma but new to me as this is my first is the buzzing the TV makes. I am sure I will get used to it and I don't hear it when the TV volume is up, but if there is a show on and there is a quiet part of the show I can hear the buzz. Not so loud that I can't ignore and live with it though.So my overall opinion of this TV is I love the thing. You drop this kind of money on a TV it has a lot to live up to and its very easy to get buyers remorse. I am so happy I made the choice to buy this set.I have only had the TV for a day so If I think of anything more I update my review. Ask any questions and ill do my best to answer.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sub-screen spider craking , hundreds complaints on same issue but Samsung Poor quality and support", "Author": "Raj", "ReviewID": "R353L2Z5K1GZFM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "TV developed sub-screen spider cracks and suddenly died , Samsung's own tech noted ,\"No External damage to screen\" .

Prohaszka \"Thrack\"", "ReviewID": "R1BZ7AISDCQHWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is a little background.  My old Toshiba 55\" rear projection did not work so well after I upgraded to HiDef on my Dish subscription, so I started to investigate new TV options.  I have 3 picture windows in the room with the TV, so I sit with my back to the windows, and the TV is directly oposite, so I tend to see the windows reflected in the Toshiba.  The windows show the setting sun so my room gets hot and bright during the evening sun set.I looked into LED and Plasma TV's.  I went to the 2012 HDTV Shootout and watched all the videos, went to CNET for reviews, etc.  I decided I would consider the following: Panasonic 65\" VT50 (plasma), Samsung UN60ES8000 (LED), and Samsung PN64E8000(Plasma).  I went to BestBuy and looking at the wall of TV's, the plasmas looked dull and the LEDs bright and clear.  I ended up at Pauls TV, and they had better lighting to actually compare the TV's.  In the darker lighting, the plasmas looked better.  I ended up getting the ES8000 LED at the last minute since it just seemed to POP and there was a bundle deal going on (Bray and 3d glasses). Pauls TV indicated I could exchange the TV (a 1 time deal) if I didn't like it.  More on this stores policy shortly.I was worried about the thin metal border around the ES8000, but when I got it home, you can't even see it.  The design is very cool, I like the U shap stand.  I had the TV for about 2 weeks.  Here are the testing and observations:Day Time/Birght Viewing:- Picture bright- Wide angle was pretty good, about 55-60 degrees from center on either side( total 120degree viewing)- A lot of glare from the LED screen from the windows...alot- HiDef from DISH great- XBOX games, great, appeared to have some lag- Dark areas harder to see- 3D was great in bright light- Animation looked great (how to train dragon, etc), movies ok.Night Time/Dark Viewing- Picture Too Bright.  I futzed with the settings constantly.- Viewing angle over 45 degrees, washout duller picture occured- Consistency of colors and bright/dark scenes not good. I was always futzing with the modes to try to see the picture better.- 3D was great due to the brightness.- I did calibrate based on CNET settings for movie mode, but I just coudn't get good contrast with some movies (MI4, Darknight, etc)- Horrible Flashlighting on all 4 corners, and a half circle near bottom center of screen.  Any dark scene showed this. I futzed with the backlight and it helped, but then the contrast and picture quality suffered.So, I sent that back, and since I had a 1 time exchange I planned on getting the Panasonic VT50 since it had the best rating, and seemed to be bright in the store.  I would have had to return my samsung bundle, and pay an additional $500 to get the VT50, and it didn't come with 3d glasses and some of the other features that Samsung had, so I got the PN64E8000 since it was a $0 cost to me.  Playing with the settings in the store, I could get the picture closer to the VT50.  Also, the E8000 was 3rd or second if you look at the HDTV Shoot out ratings.I set the TV up, and had it in my bright room, and was expecting a dim picture...BUT IT WASN\"T!  It was about 10:00 in the morining, so the ambient light wasn't too bad.  The reflection seemed to be less on this tv also.Here are my observations: (No buzzing heard, which I read could have been an issue)Day Viewing- Picture quality was amazing, bright accurate colors.  It felt real, not fake like LED- Great contrast and blacks- Seemed to be better than the LED in terms of motion- Pure whites not as bright as LED, the only all white scene of a movie I recall is Harry Potters dream sequence that was all white, other than that, the whites are pure when mixed with other movie details. (even in Inception during the snow scene).- Viewing Angle, easily 180 degrees, no picture degredation like the LED had.  This is sooo anoying on the LED.Evening- More dim viewing started to occur, but I pulled the blinds and that fixed it.  I had to do this with the LED due to LED glare, so not a big deal.Night- Fantastic quality and more than bright enough.- I watched Mars Needs Moms and that movie just pops with color and I couldn't believe how great it looked, very vibrant.Other concerns I had were image retention and burn in.  Again, I looked all over for these issues and the samsung actually seemed to protect better than the VT50.  These seem to be URBAN LEGENEDS giving plasma a bad rap.  I am trying to be careful the first 100hrs, mixing content and making sure logos don't stay on for too long.  Apparently, the plasma should be evenly used to assist with reducing image retention issues.  It does put out more heat and use more energy compared to LED.Other features are ok, such as the netflix streaming, etc. The motion and voice control are not the best, on either the LED or Plasma samsung.Regarding Pauls TV, I was not getting consistent answers on the return policy, they failed to deliver all of my order, and I'm still waiting.  They did deliver next day which was amazing, give them credit here.  I know people buy from Amazon and seem to have luck, but Best Buy was willing to work with me. Unfortunately, Pauls TV was charging a %15 restock fee. Best Buy didn't do that for me. Need I say more...UPDATE JAN 4, 2013I have to say, that at least once a week I make the comment \"I LOVE THIS TV\".  The picture seems to be getting more brilliant and vibrant.  Playing more xbox games, like halo4 and skyrim.  AWESOME quality, no burn in issues with about 3-4 hr sessions.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best TV I have ever seen", "Author": "Knoxman", "ReviewID": "RINRB57YT77MC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me say that last year I bought the Samsung D8000 and Panasonic VT30 and returned them because I was not completely satisfied. The D8000 had an extremely loud, constant buzz that was too loud to be able to be ignored. It also had significant problems with \"brightness pops\". Otherwise, it had incredible color and picture. After I returned the Samsung, I went with all the recommendations and went with the Panasonic VT30. I was supremely disappointed with the Panasonic. I never felt that it had an amazing or even impressive picture. It was completely lack luster to me. The color on the Panasonic was also below average (significantly worse than my three year old Samsung $600 720p plasma). The E8000 is the most amazing TV I have ever seen. The color and definition on the E8000 are amazing. The features are awesome. It appears that the 3D is better than the D8000 as well (much less ghosting). It does still have a small buzz to it but it is no where near as loud as the D8000 and is not annoyingly noticeable. I have not seen any problems with brightness pops yet/either. In summary, I highly recommend this TV!", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very loud HUM!", "Author": "Stephanie Lester", "ReviewID": "R20EM5OHP9K94C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ignored the other reviews claiming that this TV had a loud hum, thinking that they were overly picky or had extremely amazing hearing, but I should have listened.  This TV has the loudest and most obnoxious hum/buzz I have ever heard (like hundreds of wasps swarming in front of you) - no matter how far away you are (I stood back 30 ft and still heard the sound).  And, the problem is exactly as another reviewer described: if you are standing directly in front of this TV, the sound is unbearable. If you are to the left or right of it, you won't hear a thing.  Incredibly bizarre and awful.  Had to send it back.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Brian Spence \"bspence11\"", "ReviewID": "R1PSRRYOYVY03Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My dad has the same model but from two years ago, and this is such a great tv. I see now why Apple uses Samsung for their retina displays - it's a just a great picture. The 3D is the best I've ever seen. The app store is turning into more fun that I thought it would be (I thought it'd be gimmicky). Google Maps, Netflix, Twitter, etc are all what you'd want and expect. The Twitter app can even provide an overlay on screen, or switch the picture into a smaller window so nothing is obstructed. The part of the TV that is gimmicky is the voice/video/touch screen/motion controls. Sorry, but a remote will always be better than the slowness of saying several commands in succession, moving my hand long enough for the camera to recognize it, or whatever. The microphone has also turned on several times because of what someone on TV has said (I use external speakers, and I hear that it's not a problem if you're only using the internal ones). I agree with the above reviewer, the camera should let you know when it comes on. The stand was missing four screws when I opened the box. Really bummed about that, but they're pretty standard screws that I was able to pick up at the hardware store. The touch-based remote doesn't appear to work with my STB, although it's supposed to. I hope someone at Samsung can figure that out because I hate having multiple remotes.Sounds like I'm making a long list of problems with this TV, but honestly, I've never seen a better picture on a TV anywhere. I more than adequately performs how I want a TV to perform. I've never played a video game that looked like what I see on  my TV. Movies look amazing and the 3D is bright and sharp. The app store has lots of potential. The other little features (voice control, camera, gestures, etc) are just gimmicks that didn't sell me on the TV anyway. Very happy with this purchase.(BTW, unlike other commenter, I have the 64\" version)", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loud Hum and poor Support - I would not recommend.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3UGT3JVMMQZY8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The picture is great - I will give Samsung that.  The black is really black.  The internet browser / wifi and many other features work well and are easy to setup.The problem with my unit is that it hums.... so loud you can hear it from 35 feet away.  Every time I change channels, switch inputs, the audible hum is a huge distraction.Then I tried to get it repaired.... and got the run around.  After the repair guy got there and said - \"yes it hums\" I tried to get parts.  Samsung told me they could see the parts (plasma and power supply) in the warehouse but they couldn't figure out how to ship them.  I am not kidding.  Apparently they have a new shipping / logistics system but could not figure out how to ship the parts to the repair guys....and get this so they canceled the repair order without telling me.  So I restarted the process....  I've spent the last 3 weeks on the phone trying to return it.  Finally recevied authorization thsi morning.  We'll see if they follow through.Thank god this happened before it was out of warranty.  The other good news is the new Panasonic's are now out!I tried a similar post on their website but it did not get posted.... I can't imagine why.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Corner Cutting, Not Cutting Edge, Poor Workmanship", "Author": "Cos", "ReviewID": "R3URA46YHOA4E1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Updated 1/15/2013: I wish I could lower my review.  Set still not fixed.  I am on my third main board, samsung refuses to replace set, and gives me the run around. I have lost time out of work, samsung puts you on hold and acts like they have no idea there is even a problem.  Last tech wrote up the set was still not fixed, and samsung refuses to replace set.  Some one did call back once, left a number, refuses to return any of my numerous calls.  Samsung is terrible, the worst, do not buy anything from them, ever.It is VERY difficult to hook an HDMI cable into the Samsung connector strip.  I tried 3 different cables, different vintage cables including newest, and all three HDMI connectors on TV.  I tried this while TV was laying flat face down and again after it was up.  You really have to push hard to get a connection, and the connector plate on TV moves when you push on it!  Wow!  What a piece of ####.  I later went to a local store and noticed the HDMI connector plates also move on a UN65ES6500, and again on the UN65ES8000, thus I suspect this is a 2012 design flaw, that is not a problem if everything is lined up perfectly, but if the pannel on your set is somewhat off, like on mine, then it is a serious problem, and I suspect that sooner or later it will be a problem on many sets.  Without HDMI connection the only thing I have is the smart internet features, which so far are mostly worthless.  They work, but even with the dual processor, it takes forever to get to anything, it is really just not worth having that stuff, and most of it costs extra (except U-Tube, way to go U-Tube!)  Get a set with U-Tube, its free and has a lot of stuff, a lot of less than great stuff, but also a lot of great stuff.Check out the connector panel on a set at a store and see for yourself.  If you push it it will move.  Think about what that might do after a bunch of connections are main and un made.So far Samsung is not able to fix.  They offered to send a tech, but Samsung claims the techs are not allowed to move the TV at all.  Thus I would need to have a couple people to be able to move the TV, lay it flat for the tech, then try to get the tech to wait while it is put back up to confirm the fix works.  Samsung said this is their policy, so if you are a little older (like me) and lucky enough to have enough to afford a top of the line Plasma TV, Samsung cares not for your needs and inabilities, thus be smart and buy another brand.  Basically I have to hire two men and pay them several hundred dollars to move the TV around for Samsung's Tech.  They claim this is an insurance issue and I understand why.  This set is very very very fragile.  (Mine was defective out of the box).  Taking it of a rack is not that hard, but laying it flat is very difficult.  The 64\" has no lateral strengh, it is very very frail, you can hear it and perhaps feel it fail in your hands as you try to gently lower it down.  Its a piece of XXXXX.  If you are not able to handle 70~80 lbs of extreemly fragile TV, yes this baby is ready to break for the slightlest bit of stress, you may wish to consider a different brand.  Samsung PN64e8000 is #####.  On the plus side, the picture qulity is slightly better(very slightly) than my twelve year old top of the line plasma (not made by Samsung), which buy the way has good quality connectors which do not move when you touch them.It is really a shame Samsung cut corners on a ~$3,000 TV.  Then they load you up with a lot of features which really do not work.  The voice and motion control is crap, the apps are mostly useless taking forever to find and get to, then they end up being some short thing loaded with commercials, and the TV is slow slow slow slow.  The dual processor is junk, I guess two incredibly slow processors are not worth one good one.  Not it is slow before you make it to the download stage, so it has nothing to do with your internet connection, it is just slow.  The virtual keyboard is hard to use and the extra touch pad remote appears to be completely worthless.  Yes completely worthless, it either wont move the aroow or the arrow jumps past what you are aiming for, and once you are at where you wont to be, there appears to be no way to select it without touching the touch pad, which moves you off where you need to be,If Samsung agrees to fix TV (Broken RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!), I will edit review so those reading will know what happens, but so far all I get is a polight time sucking run around, run around.  Don't bother entering any data into their phone system, when you finally reach a person, they will not have anything you entered.UPDATE:  Samsung deleted my help request ticket without fixing set.  I am on my third help ticket number, and yes this does suck up hours of time and gets you knowhwere.UPDATE:  Samsung will still not agree to fix set, but they did state that the main electronics board needs to be replaced.  I take it this means the HDMI connectors are part of the most expensive part in the TV.  What sheer crap.  Instead of a 50 cent connector, when your connector goes bad (and it will, it already moves right out of the box, so if yours is working now, one day it wont) you have to buy a board that costs hundreds of dollars, perhaps over a $1,000 for the entire bill.  Most people will just live with one less connector, but only one of the connectors is ARC, so if you need that and its the one SOL.  Smart people will just buy another brand of TV.In summary it would be best if consumers boycott Samsung products, maybe then they will change their agressive hostile customer service policies.  It may also be helpful if american citizens vote against right wing republican's who feel that consumer protection is not the role of Government.  If not Government, then who, it is obvisously not going to be Samsung.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "I FIXED THE BUZZING SOUND- otherwise, great TV", "Author": "Chris D. Leister", "ReviewID": "R1D4KDWKC1KPDX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is for all the other reviewers out there having a problem with the buzzing sound.  As noted, a slight buzz is part of the plasma technology. When the TV volume is down or off, you can hear a slight hum.  It's really minor, and once your volume is over 10-15, you can't hear it at all.  HOWEVER- I think some reviewers are really hearing a LOUD BUZZING SOUND.  In fact I heard this on my TV after about a week or two.  This buzz was REALLY loud and annoying, and occurred whenever deep bass played (such as during an explosion, or music, etc).  It was so annoying and distracting, normally during a very tense scene.So I kept turning the volume up and down, replaying that scene, and stood next to the TV to listen to the buzz.  What I figured out was, there is a panel on the back of the TV that is just loose.  If you are looking at this TV from the front as if you were watching it-- this panel is on the bottom left of the TV- on the backside.  You see on the front bottom left of your TV when you hit your remote- a red light flashes?  The loose panel is on the back of the TV right behind that (I assume this panel then stores the sensor etc).Basically I was listening for buzzing in the speakers and moving my hand all over the TV- and when I put my hand over that panel, it stopped buzzing!  Basically that panel is just loose, so when the bass drops, it vibrates and makes the buzzing sound.  Unfortunately there is no screw or allen screw in the panel- I don't think you are supposed to access it- so, you can't tighten it.  I just put some Duct tape on the panel and now the buzzing is completely gone!!!  Imagine my relief! And since it's on the back of the TV- nobody sees the duct tape- so really, who cares.Anyways put some duct tape on this back panel and I bet your buzzing will stop!Otherwise, everything else about this TV is great! I will do a more in depth review later after I've had the TV longer, but for now I wanted to mention how I fixed the buzzing in case it helps anyone else!", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "PN64E8000GF Your Plasma TV Is Buzzing Loudly", "Author": "Sam Beckett \"Quantum Leap\"", "ReviewID": "RU0LZAQBA4IZF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "No where on the packaging of this TV was I told that it would buzz.  It buzzes loudly.  I live in a low altitude.  Samsung says:PN64E8000GF Your Plasma TV Is Buzzing LoudlyPlasma TVs typically make a soft buzzing sound. This is normal. It's caused by the electrical charges that are used to create the images on the screen. The buzzing, however, should not be so loud that you can hear it when the volume on the TV is set at normal levels.If the buzzing sound is loud, you may have set the brightness on the TV too high. To decrease or eliminate the buzzing, try setting the brightness and contrast lower. You can also have loud buzzing if the back of your Plasma TV is too close to a wall or other hard surface. To decrease the buzzing, try moving your TV away from the wall.If neither of these suggestions work, you need to get your TV serviced. To begin the service process and arrange a service appointment, click the Create Online Service Request button at the bottom of this page.Important: Plasma TVs do not operate properly above 6500 feet (approximately 1950 meters). If you attempt to operate a Plasma TV above this height, it will buzz very loudly. Unfortunately, there is no way to stop the buzzing at that altitude.

This was the first thing that surprised me about the unit.  Originally was looking at Samsung's LED models but you'll see below why I went this the Plasma. I also picked it because since I watch a lot of sports I never have to worry about the blurring refresh rate effect seen in most LCD/LED panels.Color: Very noticeable blacks are darker colors just pop out very vivid. Just watch a movie on this panel and you'll know what I'm talking about (literally go to Bestbuy and see).Features: Pretty much has everything in the market today (SmartTV, 3D, hand/voice recognition, integrated camera and game mode with enough ports for anyone.My only con is the slight \"humming\" but that is to be expected with plasma panels.

The fit, finish and quality of the PN60E8000 is excellent. The functionality of the basic features is superb but there are plenty of opportunities for improvement.First and most important, picture quality is outstanding; great colors, no jitter or other distractions. Also, no humming noises - just nothing to complain about. Netflix streaming and digital audio out via optical cable back into the Audio Video Receiver in our home theater system is outstanding. Using the optical cable allows you to feed the audio received directly from the internet into your tv back into your home theater system speakers instead of using the tv's speakers. By the way, this tv's speakers are excellent and loud. I don't use them in our setup but tested them and they work very well. Also, a keyboard and mouse may be useful for use with this tv's web and apps interface; I generally stream Netflix into our home theater system via the Blu-Ray player because it has an easier interface to work with so the sound is piped through the AVR right into the tv along with the video.Overall, setup was straight forward. But, like most computing systems, setup is where things always seem to get a bit challenging. It's a new unit to us and there are so many features. Samsung made an effort to simplify things through their automated setup process and most of it is clear.  And, I called Samsung support toll free when I did have an issue and they provided the answer within 5 minutes.I agree with a previous reviewer that voice recognition and motion control are not seemless. There's more development work that needs to be done to optimize these features. The digital remote control is interesting but Samsung would be doing great if they could buy Logitec and their Harmony remote controls to more fully integrate remote control features into a home theater system. If you're just controlling the tv with the Samsung remote, it works perfectly.Shipping and recieving via Pilot was excellent. They delivered on time, handled the boxed unit carefully, unboxed and tested the tv and remote control, were polite and even removed their shoes without being asked.Will post additional updates.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Picture incredible, other features iffy.", "Author": "RK", "ReviewID": "R1U3L4AKW7R6AH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Smart Remote jumps around when using the trackpad.

Lancaster", "ReviewID": "R2ADTY2VBCA70J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't bore you with a long review here. I read the reviews about cracked screens, loud buzzing, image retention, and the various other reported problems with this set. I am glad I decided to go to CNET and watch their video review in which the reviewer states this is the best picture he has ever seen on a Samsung tv. I am also very happy I read reviews on other tech sites and forums where it was stated this set had the best 3d they had ever seen. I pulled the trigger and have had the set for a little over a week now and I have been breaking it in strictly on HD programming. The set now has 100 hours of use on it. As far as the \"breaking in\" period goes Samsung says there is no need to break the new plasma sets in. There is much contention about this on various tech forums and I just decided to play it safe and get at least one hundred hours on it before I played any video games or watched standard definition stuff.Needless to say there is NO LOUD BUZZING. Sorry about the caps but I wanted to stress this fact. I don't know about anyone who reported this but my personal experience has been no detectable noise at all comes from this set. This also includes the people who claim to hear the plastic expanding and contracting from the heat of having the set on for long periods of time. NONE HERE!There is no image retention at all on this set. I did use some quick calibration settings from a certain tech site before I started using the set because I wanted to make sure this did not happen. Some folks recommend you set the tv at it brightest level while breaking it in. I chose not to do this because of image retention or burn in. Instead I dimmed  the bright level and just broke it in on hd programming only using the calibration settings I found.The picture on this television is as beautiful as you would expect from a plasma set. This is my first one after having DLP and LED sets. This is actually replacing a Samsung 61 inch LED set I have had for around four years. The picture on that set was excellent or so I thought. I now understand when someone says LED looks washed out compared to Plasma. The colors are so much richer and vibrant on the Plasma set. Blacks are inky and deep just like they should be. You won't get this on an LED set.Yes, the screen is glossy. My living room window is to the right of where I have the set placed. I have regular curtains on it and they do an adequate job of blocking the light when I use them. Most of the time I just leave them as they are which is cracked open a bit and there is no problem. I like the glossy screen and watch most of my tv at night anyway so this is not an issue. Don't worry about the glossy screen.I love 3d movies and have been a 3d nut since childhood. I have seen many of the classics and most of the 80's stuff at the theater. I own anaglyphic copies of every 3d movie ever made it seems like...lol I wondered why everything wasn't in 3d when I was a youngster..lol So it is with great pleasure I say that the 3d on this set is everything I had hoped for and more. So far I have watched Dial M For Murder, My Bloody Valentine, Piranha, Resident Evil:Afterlife, and Creature From the Black Lagoon. The 3d was excellent in all of them especially the ones that were shot in 3d and not converted. All of the above except Piranha were shot in 3d. When you are watching something in 3d on this set it looks as though you are staring through a window into another world. The depth is there and some items do appear as if they are off the screen and in your lap. Perfect. This tv will also convert 2d into 3d. Not expecting any miracles I tried this a few times on baseball and a few films. It definitely adds depth and works to a certain extent. I would say better than expected but would you want to use this all of the time? I doubt it. Nice to have though. The glasses that are included are fine and work very well but you may want to seek out another pair if you feel these let in to much light. I watch in a dark room so they don't bother me. Those that say 3d is just a gimmick either don't know what they are talking about or have no respect for it at all. 3d truly does make a film more immersive experience and adds a certain level of fun and audience participation to films. If Martin Scorcese backs it people should listen and he is pushing to have ALL of the classic 3d films released to blu ray. House of Wax with Vincent Price will be released on 10.1/2013. I can't wait for this one!My opinion is you can't go wrong with this set. I had to order it twice though. The first time the delivery company CEVA called me and said the box was so damaged they were not even going to bother bringing it. They sent it back. I had to re-order the set but this time instead of using free super saver shipping I paid the shipping fee and it was delivered by Pilot this time around with no issues. The good news is the price had dropped around 200.00 when I ordered it the second time. I would also recommend paying the shipping fee and skipping the free shipping even though as much as you pay for these TV's I know it is tempting to do.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the top two 60\" Plasma TV's on the market period...", "Author": "Jeff Gaipo \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R3KCWP644L3O14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had many plasma TV's over the years. Plasma TV's have come a long way in terms of reliability and maintenance IMHO. I have owned and still do own two 50\" Panasonic Plasmas and a 58\" Samsung Plasma. Now with the addition of this 60\" for my \"man room\" I am very happy.Out of the box the picture is good. I currently have it in MOVIE mode and I am quite happy with the results. You can have this TV or any TV professionally calibrated. Be aware with any Plasma TV you have to wait a minimum of 150-200 hours (recommended by industry) to have it calibrated. I have yet to self calibrate it myself and I have yet to play any of PS3 on it. I currently have (TV is on now as I write this) about 40 hours on this set. There are a bunch of web site that can give you calibrated settings for this TV, but be aware that everyone's room conditions (ambient light for instance) is very different. Just be aware that settings online may not fit your situation.I posted a few pictures of my room setup. This TV does and will reflect light from windows or even a table lamp while you are viewing. The only plasma sets I have ever seen that really combats the reflectivity was the Pioneer Elite and  the \"V\" Series Panasonic's. Having said that I am very happy with this TV in regards to the light reflectivity that this screen has.As far as color is concerned, this TV reproduced black levels extremely well. Again outside of a \"V\" series Panasonic that I also was able to view, I am very happy with it. Skin tones, white and grey reproduction is on point for me. I am watching the World Baseball Classic on MLBHD and the picture pops out. If I may suggest before purchasing any TV you purchase, is to see it in person first (if possible of course). Go to the big blue and yellow store as I did first to compare the two TV's I had in mind, then look for the best price. Here on Amazon this TV was $500 cheaper than there advertised price.Now lets get down to the SMART features of this TV. The gesture control is at best fair. It does take some practice to get used to, but in reality I don't use it. This TV is part of a home theater set up and I use a receiver for video and sound anyway. Voice navigation is again at best fair. If the room is at all noisy the TV will not recognize your voice. There is an additional remote that comes with this TV and it has a built in speaker that you can talk into and it does a fair job. Again I use the remote more to do anything over the voice navigation. I cannot speak of how the video camera works (I don't use any social networking site or apps either) so I can't elaborate on those features.3D is awesome IMHO! I do not see any cross talk as others have stated with this set. I have watched Wreck It Ralph and Finding Nemo in 3D and it is mind blowing. Colors and picture depth are on point and then some! The glasses that are included are comfortable to wear through an entire movie. They are powered by one CR2025 battery. Pairing them to the TV was painless and easy. The only downfall to these glasses are that they are open on the sides. If you have any light source to the sides of the open areas of your glasses, I can see it being as distracting. Until I find another set, these will do just fine and are really priced right.Overall this TV was a killer buy! It has plenty of options to tweak the picture to your liking. It has a very attractive frame and it small so your eyes focus on the picture rather than the frame of the TV itself. Oh there is no \"buzzing\" effect as some have stated on this set that is audible. Unless you are specifically looking for it, this should not be a concern. I don't know if I have left anything out, but if you have any questions, please fell free to ask and I will do my best to address them.

I bought this because I had an older tube television.  My old TV still works great (now in the guestroom), but I just thought it was time to move up.  My son and I love TV, and I was really attracted to the 3D capability.  I purchased the TV about three months ago after doing some research.  I was a bit put off by some of the negative reviews here, but I decided to take a chance.  Almost three months later I am very happy I did.  Right from the box I noticed this was like no TV I had ever seen before.  I put on one of my son's Disney movies (Cars) on BlueRay, and I was just blown away by the definition and the vibrant colors.  I didn't notice any buzzing or humming, and I still haven't.  No burn in either.  My son and I also love the 3D feature which I feel surpasses anything I have seen in a movie theater.  3D greatly enhances the entertainment experience.  Friends and relatives who have watched the TV all agree with this.  Many comment that the picture is the finest they have ever seen.  This is certainly true for me.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  It is an excellent value.  This TV is amazing, and we have spent many hours enjoying this fine product.  One aspect I can't comment on is face or voice recognition.  I haven't set either of them up.  Perhaps I am one of the lucky ones, but I give this product my highest rating.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality", "Author": "JohnC", "ReviewID": "R4VR8H551KTV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV a week ago and I am very impressed with the picture quality - it is outstanding.  My criteria for picking a new TV was picture quality and an attractive design, and this TV has both.  I owned the D8000 plasma for 6 weeks.  The picture quality was also good, but I had a problem with the Bezel developing sparkling specs in it that looked bad, so it was replaced with the E8000.  I had thought that the picture quality of the E8000 would be similar to the D8000, however I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is significantly better.  The colors seem a little richer and more vibrant, and the blacks are considerably better being darker and more inky.  This all adds up to a great picture that is very real and almost takes on a three dimensional feel with a regular 2D source.  The only slight issue I see is that the dark scenes in some movies seem a bit too dark with some loss of detail.  However, this is a minor issue when weighed against the overall PQ.  Also, I have not calibrated the set yet - I am using the out of the box Movie settings, and it is possible that I may be able to lighten the shadows a bit, although this may be a limitation that cannot be adjusted away.I have only briefly looked at the Smart TV features because they don't interest me and I think Samsung's smart TV stuff is a bit of a joke.  I have an Apple TV, and it has a much better interface for things like Netflix etc.  I have tried the voice commands for fun, but they don't work reliably - a complete waste of time.  From my perspective, I would have preferred if all this stuff wasn't in the TV because I am only interested in the TV for its picture.The picture controls are excellent, and I have also noticed the the sync of sound to video seems better that the D8000.  My set up uses a modern A/V (NAD) receiver hooked up via HDMI, but in some situations it seemed that the sound and the video were not quite in sync with the D8000, but I have not noticed the same issues with the E8000.  (I realize that sound/video sync problems can also come from the source, so it can be difficult to know what is causing the problem)Overall, excellent so far.One bad thing related to Samsung, not the TV.  Samsung support is about as bad as it gets.  The first line people know nothing, the wait times to escalate have been 30 mins, and a lot of the second level support people also know nothing.

Nothing short of Spectacular.  I was looking at a couple tv's before i decided to purchase this Tv. The models were. 55vt50 from panasonic, as well as the 55XBR950 from Sony. Everyone knows the VT has been the #1 rated tv last 8 years according to Consumer Reports. Then the Sony XBR is always the Highest Rated LED TV year in and year out as well.It wasn't until I saw all 3 tv's basically side by side in a Magnolia Home Theatre Store that I really took notice to this Unit and how great it actually is.Compared to the VT50 from Panasonic the colors were actually much brighter and a little bit more vivid as well. (Avatar was playing on both) Both fantastic Units. The Panasonic had a little bit better black tones, but not by much. The 8000 kinda crushed the blacks a little more than the VT and saw a tiny bit less detail that the VT as well. but at the time I could not Justify the 800$ price difference for the 2. 8000 Samsung Plasma beat out the VT for me based solely on Value because pixel for pixel, both the Tv's were essentially Identical in terms of Picture Quality.Compared to the XBR from sony though its a different story. Of course with the 8000 being plasma, motion was infiitesimally MUCH MUCH better than on the XBR. looked much more fluid, looked real in a sense where the XBR with its MotionFlow looks a little animated in terms of fast motion going across it. XBR was considerably brighter than any of the plasmas i looked at, but you definitaly could tell the difference in terms of Color Richness. 8000 hands down better than the XBR with that because with the XBR being LED it kinda washed out the colors a little bit. plus with the XBR a little north of 3k the e8000 was a much better overrall price, and better picture quality as well. (For those of you who dont know, PLASMA not LED, gives you the BEST PICTURE QUALITY)Hands Down, the e8000 Series Samsung Plasma is one if not THE BEST TV out on the market right now.

Panaonic's equivalent model costed more during my purchase (now about $50 less). However Samsung has an inbuilt camera. Big plus for me. Panasonic does not come with a camera.2. Delivery. White glove delivery. Nice touch from Amazon.3. Features - Works well. Updates happened without me having to do anything besides restarting the TV (reboot? really? for a TV?). So far no issues. I haven't even read the manual, BIG PLUS! (who reads manuals?)4. I was worried that the screen will be too shiny. With a huge window right behind me, it's still not enough to bother. Possibly due to the angling down of the TV.Negatives:1. Not really a Samsung issue, but I couldn't access some features directly from my universal remote. The Samsung remote had shortcut keys, but I really like my existing universal remote. All features are accessible though my original universal remote, multiple button pushes.2. Gestures - nice initiative, but not very friendly. When I get animated while sitting in front of the TV, it thinks that I'm gesturing. Yet to figure out how to turn it off. My son likes it though and plays with it. (That cannot be good)3. The TV desparately needs a wireless keyboard/mouse. Doesn't come with the TV. Bought one that was plug and play. Works fine. Trying to type on the virtual keyboard is frustrating at best.4. Picture quality - I configured per Cnet settings.Still, the picture is not sharp. There's this ghost in every image. Very noticable on letters. Maybe this can be cleaned up, will have to try things with the setup.1/24/13 - The \"ghosting\" issue was because I was connected to the cable box via a coaxial cable.

I always thought 3D was a gimmick but after seeing it on this TV, its something I can get into.2. I have not used voice or gesture control. This is just a gimmick to me - just use the remote3.

It's got a lot of kitchy features, which work but they are a little glitchy so you have to learn how to use them. The 3D is very good, and I was surprised to learn that the 3D worked for Call of Duty on my Playstation 3. The conversion is pretty good too. I usually watch spots in 3D if they aren't on ESPN3D. Most other TV I watch in 2D. If you are going to use the smart capabilities you are definitely going to need some kind of keyboard. I got the Samsung model. It was expensive, but it works pretty well. It's bluetooth so you can use it for other devices that use bluetooth such as many tablets including iPads, and it's customized for the TV so you can use it like a remote (which isn't really practical unless you're already using the keyboard).My one real complaint is that the picture in picture only seems to work for different sources, so you can't have a cable channel in the main screen and a different channel in the picture in picture box - it has to be a different source I think. That makes the picture in picture pretty much worthless to me. Also, the \"special\" remote that pairs with the IR blaster is worthless, along with the IR blaster. I wasn't really expecting them to be cool so that's why I am not really holding it against the TV.The TV you buy is going to depend on what features are important to you and your budget.

Fantastic 3D and HD quality, love the feautures, awesome SmartHub.With regards to a few common things people tend to complain about. Speed of SmartHub, of course it isn't going to be blazing fast. It's not a full computer, so expecting it to be as fast as the computer you're likely use to isn't exactly fair. It's fairly quick.Also, for sound quality - correct, it's not a strong point. But that's what buying speakers are for. You buy flat panel TV's like this knowing the sound won't be very good. Buy a decent 5.1 sound system for $250-$350 and you'll have pretty decent sound for cheap without breaking the bank. :)The biggest gripe? Standard definition quality. Not great. But 3D and HD - which is mostly what you'll probably watch on this - is absolutely incredible!UPDATE AFTER A FEW MONTHS:I can't saw my opinion has changed much. The TV has still proven absolutely phenomenal with an outstanding, clear, crisp color. Following break-in suggestions, we have had no issues with burn-in. The TV is awesome for HD Bluray movies and HD games on the PS3, and the 3D is nice - on movies where it's made for 3D, images REALLY pop. On games, movies, and shows where it's not originally 3D, using the 2D-to-3D conversion has a range of results from slightly noticeable difference to \"WOW! This has to be meant for 3D!\" quality depending on what you're watching or playing.In the end, I couldn't be happier! I plan on getting the Samsung Evolution Kit to upgrade the Smart Hub, processing power, etc for a better Smart Hub experience. I love the Evolution Kit setup as you're able to upgrade every year to the latest without having to buy a whole new TV. Obviously, the only thing the Evolution Kit doesn't effect directly is the image quality (screen doesn't change...

I find myself wanting to watch movies on this plasma more than my ES8000 LED. I finally was able to tweak it to where the colors \"pop\". The viewing angle is so much better than the LED and the blacks are black.(Things I love more about this Plasma than my ES8000 sets)1) The black levels are way better than my ES8000 LED's. Actually, blacker than all my LED's2) The viewing angle is close to perfect where I can sit all the way to the side and still see a clear colorful picture.3) No motion blur or Stutter. Everything is smooth without the S.O.E (Soap opera effect) ( for people who don't like this)4) natural bright colors that pop.5) The brightness is great and the whites are whiter than I thought they would be for a plasma.(Things I don't like)1) I had some image retention only once, but it went away fast. I haven't seen it since though.2) uses more electricity than my LED's. This isn't really a big concern to me though since its not on all day.I will note though that it took a couple of weeks to really notice how amazing this plasma is compared to my ES LED's. I also think that this plasma is a little better than my D8000 plasma from last year which is now in a guest room.  If I needed another TV though, I probably would get another one of these instead of the LED. I now regret buying the 65\" ES8000 LED and not this Plasma 64\" for my Man cave in the basement. I've had the LED for a while now so that's how I know which one I like the most.(Original review)Bought this set after having a good experience with last years D8000 plasma. I also own a few of the ES8000 LED's and last years D8000's LED and plasma. I think this TV is amazing though, but I don't think it stay this amazing for long. The other night, I watched a movie on Netflix that had letterbox. The movie was about an hour long. After the movie, I powered it down and the next night when I turned it on, their was image retention. It did go away after a couple days, but since I broke it in for 200 hours before I watched a movie on it, and did all the necessary things to break a plasma in, I'm surprised that one hour would do this.My D8000 plasma never did this, which really makes me wonder if Samsung cut some more corners for this years models. Their quality control seems to be getting worse year after year. One of my D8000 LED's failed right when the warranty ended, but luckily I registered the TV on Samsung's site and got the extra 3 months added on to the year. I've had a lot of issues this year with Samsung. In the end, they came through, but it was a lot of work. It shouldn't be like that. When I have an issue with any of my Apple products, it gets taken care of right away. They go above and beyond to make me happy. Even though they are as big as they are now, they still have the \"Best\" customer service.  As far as this TV goes, I can't recommend it only because of all the Qualty control issues. If your looking for an amazing picture for just 2 years and don't mind buying another set in 2 years, then I would say get this TV. But if your looking for a TV to last you atleast 7 years, I would then buy a Panasonic, or a LED.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "TV went dark, light blinked red, then exploded inside!", "Author": "TSB", "ReviewID": "R39GIBMP3GPLY5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've owned my Samsung PN60E8000 for exactly 1 year now (fortunately, I'm 20 days inside my warranty, otherwise I would be out of pocked on repair issues). I was the first to buy one when it arrived at Best Buy a year ago.Now, one year later, 2 weeks ago from today to be exact, the TV suddenly went dark in the middle of watching a program, and the little red light in the bottom left of the TV that usually indicated that it's on, but this time was blinking red. The TV wouldn't turn on, so we called Samsung support. We scheduled a Samsung repair service to come out and fix the TV for the following week after unplugging it and re-plugging it didn't work. A few days later, we tried unplugging the TV, then plugging it back in again to see if it worked, and it did this time, so we held off on having the repair company come out to fix it.Then, a week later (today at 3:20pm PST), the TV suddenly went dark again in the middle of watching a program, and seconds later, we heard 3 LOUD POPS (the sound level of gun shots), and seconds later the room was filled with the smell of burning plastic or rubber. It was scary to say the least, and I'm glad no one was hurt. I called Samsun customer support again, and they're going to reschedule a repair service to come out.For a nearly $4,000.00 TV to go bad, then EXPLODE only 1 year after purchase, this is inexcusable. Prior, I owned a Pioneer plasma for nearly 6 years, and it was the most amazing TV I've ever owned. And prior to that, a Sony which was great too.

We have had it 3 months now.  It included some sort of enhanced delivery/setup but all the delivery guy did was uncrate the TV and plug it in to make sure the thing powered up.  Of course the stand has to be assembled and attached to the TV.  Ports on the back are clearly marked.  Your devices should be attached and powered up for the TV to recognize them but that is pretty much all you have to do for the initial setup.It has a smart touch remote that we haven't used much but can be used to control basic functions for the TV, a blu-ray player and set top box.  The operating system is a bit complicated but no more so than most electronic gadgets.  The voice and motion sensor capabilities are a novelty but not a replacement for the TV remote.3D is great but the supplied glasses do have some shortcomings as you can see from the other reviews.  We needed 3 sets so we bought one pair of the more expensive glasses to try out.  They are definitely worth the investment.  We also bought a Samsung blu-ray player which matched up easily with the TV.We have used it with Skype, Netflix, Plex and Vudu in addition to cable.

Hawkins", "ReviewID": "R217WT6OVCQVON", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I ordered a TV off of Amazon Warehouse, they messed my order up.  Instead of shipping me the 55\" LG Cinema-3D edge-lit LED tv that I'd pair for, they shipped me a lower-model 51\" Samsung Plasma with no 3D but full 1080p.  I set it up and turned it on without realizing and when I saw the picture, I was BLOWN AWAY.  The colors are SO powerful and VIVID, compared to the older 42\" Vizio LCD that I had prior (which was still a great tv).Fast forward almost 2 weeks and what I own is this tv.  I am 100% in love with this tv but to keep it simple, I'll break it down.*THE GOOD*-The color.  The color is fantastic and RICH, it's actually got to be dialed down a little from the factory \"Dynamic\" setting.  Once you adjust the cell lighting, the color, and the dynamic contrast options, you can get quite a good picture out of it with very deep blacks and bright, vivid colors.-Bells and whistles.  There are a LOT of them.  The voice and gesture recognition is reasonably accurate....enough to be called 'pretty good'.  There are a few problems which are covered in 'The Bad'.-Brightness, fit and finish.  All are very good.  I have heard that it's not quite as bright as the Samsung, but seeing as the maximum cell lighting is 20 and I never take it over 15, I think that's plenty bright.-The Bluetooth.  It's built into the tv and it's actually pretty clever.  Already I've played videos off of YouTube on my phone on the television.  And if you link them, all you have to do is press Play on the video on your phone.  As long as the tv is turned on, it will change inputs and play in sync with your phone.-The menu layout, functionality, and responsiveness.  You can tell that it's got a decent little processor inside of this thing.  It's usually pretty quick with shuffling through menu's and if it does trip over itself, it does so only slightly when leaping quickly through menu's.  The Smart Center functions are also well-laid-out, the layout can be customized to a point, and it works pretty well.  Use the standard remote whenever you can for navigation, trust me.  The second 'Smart' remote is a neat gimmick for 20 minutes but I guarantee you'll feel more depressed than impressed by its use.  Save the batteries.*THE BAD*-The gloss screen.  Why...WHY would you go with a gloss finish on a high-end Plasma.  Obviously I bought a high-end Plasma to WATCH IT.  So why would you put a reflective coating on the screen....yes, it gives the colors added pop.  And it looks great as a piece of \"furniture\" when it's turned off.  But the downsides FAR outweigh the pro's.  You HAVE to keep blinds closed to see the screen well in the day time, because the gloss reflects SO much light back to you.  So you wind up looking like a junkie on a bender with all the blinds drawn and verticals closed in your living room at 1:30pm on a Sunday.-The touch remote.  Great idea, poor execution.  Thing is, do you like the touchpad on your laptop?  You'd be surprised how many people don't like theirs.  How do you think it's going to work on a remote?  The answer is not good.  Sometimes it's a little clunky and slow to respond, other times it's overly sensitive.  Aside from the quite good \"Smart Center\", the menu layout is good and simple with the standard remote but when trying to input data with the touchscreen keyboard, it just doesn't work.  To enter a web address into the built-in browser for example, you have to input it LETTER BY LETTER using...guess what?  The remote's \"mousepad\" to move a little on-screen mouse over each letter, and then you have to click it down but the clicker doesn't work quite right, so you have to try the tap function, which also doesn't work quite right.  Yes, they sell a bluetooth keyboard for the tv, but it's a tad expensive and honestly....don't you already have a computer?  And a smart phone?  Use those.-The speakers.  Maybe this is only an issue with mine, but when the volume is over about 35 or so, the speakers have a nasty \"buzz\" on loud bass notes and deep sounds.  It really kills it because otherwise, the sound is actually pretty good for an Ultra-Slim.  But if you're anything close to an audiophile, you're going to want a soundbar at least.-The included 3D glasses.  They come in a bag, not a box.  They come in 3 pieces and click together like little LEGO pieces.  The arms don't fold, they're pre-bent into a sort of spring that only makes contact with your head for a small area thinner than a pencil and about an inch long, and the bridge of your nose.  Therefore with any human-like movement, they tend to rotate lopsided, or slide their way down your nose.  The viewing area behind the glasses is actually much smaller than you would think and the button.  You literally need a fingernail to turn them on.  The button is SO flush with the surface with no distinct ridge, dimple or dot, or anything at all to tell your finger where to press.  You need to TAKE THEM OFF of your face, look at them, and try to find enough fingernail to press it.  Buy new glasses...there's a website out there that has great looking universals with BlueTooth AND IR compatibility and they're priced pretty well.For all the quirks and little details, it really is a damn good television. I think the better bet may be to go one step down on the totem pole though, the E7000....it's got all of the picture but none of the knick-knacks like gesture/voice recognition, etc.  If you're not experienced to higher-end TV's or own an older model LCD from 08-ish and you're stepping up....you will be COMPLETELY, STUPIDLY IMPRESSED.  The *only* reasons this TV gets a 4 and not a 5 is the touch remote and its functionality, the included 3d glasses, and the gloss screen finish,", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "AVOID SAMSUNG PLASMA - BURN-IN AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF USE", "Author": "BadApple", "ReviewID": "R18ZRAB0K643HJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The good: very good image quality, better than their LED TVs.The bad: After using it for 4 months the screen is already burned, in the areas where the TV displays subtitles.While I understand burn-in or retention from watching CNN tickers, games, fixed logos, etc., this was caused by the TV's own firmware flaw. When watching content from the USB stick or through the network, using srt or similar subtitles, the TV firmware puts them in BRIGHT WHITE at the same location every time. There is no option to make them another color or less bright, to alleviate the problem.The current implementation of subtitles in the 'Not So Smart TVs' could be called 'Plasma Suicide'.Samsung says 'not covered, tough luck'.The pixel scroll is useless (only 4 pixels is not enough, it just blurs the burned area a bit).The scrolling pattern that should make it better is like refinishing your floors - it will wear out every pixel a bit in hope of making them more similar in intensity (all lower).

A Two week old TV $1800  , 100 hours of breaking  in , are you kidding me.

Picture is just stunning compared with the LCD TV it replaced.  My son's XBox graphics with motion are simply amazing.  We love the impressive 3D performance, and just wish Amazon had 3D content available to rent since 3D blueray disks are still in the $30 range.  I get 45 channels of over the air TV and it is all amazingly clear and crisp.  A great way to watch football, basketball, or baseball in all its full 1080P glory.This TV has 3 HDMI ports and not four like our old one.  However Amazon sells an auto-sensing 3 or 5 port HDMI switch that I use to share the HDMI3 port on the TV.  As long as only one device is powered up at a time (the XBox or a computer) it auto-magically selects the correct one.  Problem solved.My home theater sound system is a gorgeous old analog system, and the TV has no analog sound output.  However Amazon sells a little converter box that does a great job of converting the digital audio from the TV to the full Dolby audio to drive the system.  So I can keep my surround sound.So if you have older generation equipment you want to integrate with this TV, just plan on spending an extra $50 or so for the little glue boxes you will need.  BTW:  If you have an old Wii to hook in, make the investment to buy a component cable for it (again Amazon sells them).  The old Wii supports 480P with the component cable, which is noticeably crisper than then A/V cable input on a TV this big.The only fly in the ointment I have found is that when using Netflix or Hulu from SmartHub, the digital sound output is disabled and one cannot use the surround sound, only the TV speakers.  I get around this by using the XBox or Blueray player to access Netflix or Hulu.  Sooner or later I think Samsung will figure out that they are losing movie rental sales through their SmartHub, and do a software update to fix it.  But until then, it sort of limits the usefulness of the SmartHub functionality.I do hear the soft buzz from the Plasma high voltage supply when the sound is off, but I really don't notice it when watching at normal volume.  Unless one is a person that used to hear the 15 KHz. scan on the old CRT TV's, I would not let buzz fear keep you from this great performing TV.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing, way better then LED!!!", "Author": "kyeoh1", "ReviewID": "R32UN23K2LF5H7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "And for $1170, you can go wrong with this.... the color are so beautiful and this screen refresh so fast compare to LED, you really need to see it to believe the quality of plasma!", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV I've ever owned Picture is perfect, 3D is perfect, and the high tech features will blow you away.", "Author": "richard b. stewart", "ReviewID": "R27U0ELU68LV2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT!

The movies are spectacular and you'll never see that better than on this Plasma 3D HDTV from Samsung.

Me, I'm happy enjoying the movies that were meant to be...spectacular color reproduction, smooth and deep blacks and oh did I mention none of that motion blur in action scenes.

weeks ago there was a firmware update available under the settings menu. Ran the firmware update and was working fine for a few days. Then the wifi part of the TV stopped working. Tried factory reset, tried SmartTV reset (while the factory reset will reset the TV to factory conditions it does not reset the network settings. You have to reset the SmartTV in order to reset the network settings), tried power cycle, changed my router (Asus N66U) and the wifi still did not work.Basically, when I tried to connect to a wifi network, it will sometimes scan for wifi networks, but then the entire setup screen will just disappear. Sometimes it won't even scan. The TV worked fine over LAN, but I didn't want a LAN cable running through my living room to my home office.I called Samsung tech support and they were quick to set up an appointment and come take a look. Few days later a Samsung Field Engineer came with a box. He turned the TV on to try connecting to a wifi network, didn't work so he immediately unscrews the back of the TV and replaces the motherboard with a new one in a box. Screws the backplate on, does a factory reset (this time he did some weird thing with the remote and went into some really heavy duty settings menu) and the wifi still doesn't work. He opens the back again, takes a look at the wifi card (it's right behind the plastic part of the TV's back - when your looking at the back it's the bottom right) and says he thinks somethings wrong with the wifi card. I told him that I updated the firmware a few days ago and it's been giving me issues since then, he states, and I quote, \"We only tell customers to update the firmware if they're TV is having problems, we recommend not to update the firmware unless you are having issues.\" That's complete BS because if you've been looking at Samsung's firmware releases on their support/download website, they release firmwares with additional features and fixes (i.e., they just release a new firmware update (1031.0) that will: 1) Supports Angry Birds App, 2) Supports Samsung Wireless Audio Dock and Wireless Keyboard VG-KBD1500, etc - [...]). Anyway, he says he doesn't have the part so he leaves and he says his manager will call me back that day. The manager calls me back a few hours later saying they will come Friday (the technician was there Thursday), I said okay and I take the day off. YOU GUESSED RIGHT!!! No one calls or comes Friday. I call and leave a voicemail to tell them please call me Monday. YOU GUESSED RIGHT AGAIN! No one calls or comes Monday. I gave up and called Amazon. They were kind enough to take the TV back. Even though it passed 30 day return period.I WILL NEVER BUY A SAMSUNG TV AGAIN. Their phones are good though.Will probably buy the Panasonic VT50.DON'T BUY THIS TV.______________________________________________________________________Just received the TV from Amazon - March 28thI ordered the 51 inch plasma.So far:1) looks amazing - super thin and bezel is very black2) no dead pixels3) comes with 2 remotes (1 is touch base)4) comes with an IR blaster - to control your blu-ray players, etc.5) comes with 2 3D glasses - the 3D glasses require battery which is supplied6) has bluetooth built-in - for keyboards, etcsome notes:1) does not come with any type of display cables. only cable it comes with is the power cable2) very short manual3) automatically checked for software update and it did not have anything to update4) easily connected to my N (5 Ghz) wifi network5) four stars - so far so good.currently i'm letting the set break in for 150 hrs. will report back with a lot more later!edited: 03/29 - removed 1 star for shipping issueswanted to note that amazon used \"Pilot\" (pilotair dot com) shipping company to have the tv delivered from JFK airport to my apartment which is 20 minutes away. First of all, Pilot is A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SHIPPING COMPANY. They wrote on the tracking status that they had called me 2x, but I never received a call from them. I called Pilot and they basically said the TV hasn't arrived yet from JFK so they cannot deliver as scheduled. I didn't ask them why the tracking information said that they had called me 2x and said recipient is unavailable. I called Amazon large product shipping department. Amazon called Pilot and Pilot told amazon that the recipient was contacted 2x but did not pick up. Total B.S. I confirmed with Amazon the contact phone number they had on the shipping label which was correct. I ended up driving 30 minutes in traffic to pick up the tv from them. A note about their warehouse: 1) dirty, 2) disgusting, 3) bunch of people throwing boxes around - literally. Was in and out in 10 minutes. That was the only nice thing. Basically, Pilot lied to me and Amazon and didn't want to have it delivered according to scheduled delivery time. AVOID Pilot like the plague. This reflects poorly on Amazon for their selection of shipping company. In the end Amazon gave me $30 promo code, but me taking a day off from work is not worth $30 + time to drive and pick up TV + carrying 80 pound box 3 flights of stairs.additional update: 03/31/2012response to cabby on the comments:tv is quiet amazing. black are truly very black... tv on time is super quick. amazing set. colors are super vivid and so is brightness. the smart tv features are great. there's netflix vudu youtube pandora Skype (camera is also pretty damn good quality). one negative is no support for amazon prime streaming. sad because that's the only service i have. speakers are also pretty good, but out of the world, but great for such a slim tv. love the very black bezel. no issues so far in terms of picture quality/audio quality.unfortunately, i have to return the first one i received because i found a scratch one inch long on the top right side of the bezel. the black paint is removed and it's a 1 inch white scratch. found it 2 days of 24 hr break-in period (color and gray scale slides @ 1080p). amazon was nice enough to ship me a new one which will arrive on monday or tuesday. Amazon offered me 10% off if i keep the scratched tv... i said h*ll no. they're sending it by a different shipping service, not pilot but CEVA. hopefully they will be better than pilot and i can increase the rating. lol - everyone is complaining about the rating but i don't care. i consider my overall shopping experience when i review.going back to the tv. i have tried the 3D feature many times and loveee it. the glasses are very comfortable. i don't notice any crosstalk. the video is a lot dimmer through the 3D glasses, but what can u do. the tech isn't there yet.another great feature is that the tv supports VERY VERY GOOD VIDEO STREAMING out of the box. my home is on N-5Ghz network and blu-ray 720p & 1080p streaming out of the box has been very good. streamed 1080p wall-e (mkv), 720p batman beyond (mkv), 1080p the matrix (mkv). ALL flawless. My set up is ReadyNAS Duo v2 with 1 TB RAID-X, Netgear WNDR3700v2, gigabit switch. All on Cat5e ethernet with gigabit switch. Streaming is excellent.The only thing that's connected to it right now is my Xbox 360 and been playing a lot of halo reach. really good. no lag. 600 refresh rate is really great. just worried a little about the HUD giving image retention, but oh well... i love my games. just purchased ps3 for more blu-ray/3D action, but didn't take it out of the box yet to set up. also grabbed a copy of disney's WOW blu-ray calibration disk. might use that along with my Spyder4Pro calibrator after break in period of 150 hrs is over.i was seriously debating over panasonic 2012 VT50 models, but couldn't wait for a new tv until may/june (their estimated release date) because i just moved into a new apartment and needed a tv real bad.anyway the tv is a beauty. love the X stand unlike the huge big flat tv stand with the pannys.ask me any other questions.additional update: 04/01/2012- you never know if the built-in camera is on. bad decision on samsung's part. they should have some sort of indicator that the camera is on (i.e., macbook pro FaceTime cameras with the green light on the side)... i can see some sort of privacy issues coming up with that. also the camera is very poor in low light as expected for a small camera+ voice commands on the touch remote work very well... some what usefuladditional update: 04/02/2012RECEIVED MY FIRST REPLACEMENT:major issue: VERTICAL BANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DISPLAY.you can clearly see a vertical banding issue when there's a gray/white photo on the display. I thought I was crazy, but I brought a friend over to confirm. She also sees a vertical band in the middle of the screen. Contacted Amazon for a 2nd replacement. So sad. This TV is taking up way too much of my time.additional update: 04/30/2012RECEIVED MY 2ND REPLACEMENTno more vertical banding. this is a great tv. updated to the latest firmware. there was a cosmetic issue with the tv which was a small dent on the clear plastic bezel of the tv, but you can only tell if you get up close.another small issue is image retention. it's very apparent if you watch channels like TNT with their bright white logo on the bottom left or right... the TNT logo is still there even when you turn the tv on and off but goes away after a while. annoying but it's the same with most plasmas.i used CNET's calibration numbers:[...]", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it.

They have their choice of preloaded apps smack in the middle of the screen and you can't delete them.

If you are in the market for a \"regular TV\" you would be crazy to pay the extra money for a smart TV like this one. It is a plasma, the picture quality is OK, the sound, like any flat screen is poor. On that subject I bought a Samsung sound bar to go with the tv and you can't control it with the TV remote. It will not turn on AND off with the TV. Another example of poor engineering. While it is true that other brands need to connect to external servers for some functionality the others that I have don't become completely disabled when they can't connect.If you are in the market for a network enabled smart TV look elsewhere. If your priority is good picture quality, sound etc save your money and skip the bells and whistles or get a high end TV and a network enabled, smart blu-ray player.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Display needs replacing after less than 3 years of light use", "Author": "chris", "ReviewID": "R3M55P1WDDVCB1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My high end Samsung 52\" 3D TV has developed a horizontal black line across the entire upper portion of the screen.

The TV was actually hailed as the TV of the year in some circles. I've been in the TV/Film industry for 20 years and knew enough to avoid plasma TV's due to a myriad of issues. However, after reading all of the reviews, and going to the store to check out the picture quality, I was frankly very impressed. The reviews seemed to say that burn-in was no longer an issue and that the black levels and picture quality were unsurpassed. The 3D aspect of the TV was a bonus.Cutting to the heart of the reason for this review, I'll just say that I have SEVERE burn-in after only one month of use. Turns out that the stations that I watch have \"bugs\" and ID \"banners\" up for every show and they are now ghosted into my screen. I called Samsung for some support, and guess what? Burn-in is NOT covered under their warranty. Even if it happens that quickly. I was at a loss. I explained to them that this was not acceptable, but they held fast. I told them that by omitting burn-in from their warranty, they were in fact ADMITTING that it was a problem that they expected to happen. Otherwise, they would stand behind their product. They then suggested that to avoid burn-in, I should watch different channels throughout the day. Seriously, this was their solution. My solution after spending $1800 on a TV that is now defective is to first NEVER buy another plasma TV, and second, NEVER buy another Samsung product as they refuse to stand behind their products.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Smart Interaction\nSignature Services\nBuilt-in Camera\nEco Sensor and Real Black Pro Panel\nTV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 58.5-Inch x 38.8-Inch x 13.8-Inch, TV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 58.5-Inch x 34.8-Inch x 1.9-Inch", "Name": "Samsung PN64E8000 64-Inch 1080p 600Hz Ultra Slim Plasma 3D HDTV (Black) (2012 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ua-cvptmL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0077SY860"}}
