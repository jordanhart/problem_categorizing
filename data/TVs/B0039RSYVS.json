It appeared it had been a return, as the inside styrofoam was somewhat broken up...but this review is about the TV, not the delivery service. Picture Quality was not good, and I realized I had a received non-IPS panel (check the AVS forum on it or google \"le5300 panel lottery\")...it turns out that LG uses both IPS and non-IPS panels in their models below 42\". Now I've seen people on here get the IPS panel in this 37LE5300...but I wasn't so lucky. The large, white sticker on the box read 37LE5300-ASUDxxx...which means the unit was a non-IPS model. Had the sticker read ASUWxxx...it would have been an IPS panel...which is a top of the line screen. I returned the TV (amazon customer service was top-notch) and they overnighted me a replacement unit.Turns out the replacement unit was another AUSDxxx model and we refused the delivery...I don't want a crappy version of an amazing TV, that's not what I paid my money for. I'm very pleased with Amazon's amazing customer service though, but I'm extremely disappointed with LG and the way they conduct business. It's a crapshoot if you order online, I realize that now, but you couldn't beat the price at $699.00 with free two day shipping. Now the TV is at $[...] but it doesn't make sense for me to buy it, knowing I've already lost the panel lottery TWICE. I'm really disappointed with my experience, but I know Amazon is not to blame here, just the TV and their company. I'm happy for those customers who received the IPS panel, because they actually got what they were supposed to be paying for.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased!", "Author": "R. Knowlton", "ReviewID": "R1ZHMV41PUPAMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first flatscreen TV.  I bought the TV based on 4 specific features:  120Hz refresh rate, the LED backlight (and resulting power savings), the ability to play video files from USB, and 24P Real Cinema feature.  I'm glad I made the purchase.  Setup was easy, with only 8 screws to attach the stand to the TV.  The unit is stable.  I'm impressed by how thin the TV is.  All the front lights can be turned off.  The screen is a matte finish (no reflective cover).  The TV doesn't have networking capability, but I wanted to buy the best TV I could afford and then use a Blu-ray player to provide the network interface.I didn't know much about HDTVs a week ago and what I learned after about 8 hours of research and reviews is that the picture I actually see on the screen is heavily dependent on the source signal and the many different conversions the signal may go through (frame rate, aspect ratio change, deinterlacing, etc.) before it actually gets to the screen (the result of not feeding it a pure 1080p HDTV signal over an HDMI cable).  I was really frustrated over looking at TVs in retail stores because doing comparisons side-by-side, I figured, was useless unless I knew what the original source video was and whether or not all the settings in the TV were set right.  I ended up buying this TV because I figured it would give a great picture so long as I fed it with good source video.  So far, that's true.Right now, I only have a DVD player and a USB hard drive connected to it.  My cheap little $20 DVD player outputs in 480i or 480p.  The 480i signal has less jaggies on this TV than 480p.  My guess is that the deinterlacer in the DVD player is low quality, so the 480p signal fed to the TV is not so good.  I'm confident a 480p signal will look better once it's coming from a decent upconverting DVD player or Blu-ray player.  All my anamorphic widescreen (1.78, 1.85, and 2.35) DVDs display great with the TV set to 16x9.  4:3 TV stuff (like old X-Files videos) display properly too.  DVDs are clear, crisp and smooth.I'm really impressed by the ability to play videos from a USB drive.  So far I've played .avi, .mkv, .vob and .divx files up to 720p quality and file sizes between 500 MB and 2.1 GB.  (When I hit the Info button on the remote, it looks like most of my .avi and .mkv files are encoded as MP4 and H.264, if that helps.)  Windows .wmv files do not play.  Quality is beautiful!  No stuttering or pixilation.  One problem I've faced, however, is the audio and video getting out of sync on some videos after about 20 minutes of play (the video starts to lag behind).  I've been able to re-sync it by pressing stop and play.  (Maybe it'll get fixed with a firmware update?  Or maybe it's a problem with my files?)  By the way, USB videos can be resumed from where you left off if you press stop or if the video stops.  Once in awhile, videos will just stop on their own, but I'm able to start them again and they'll pick up and play just fine where they left off.  I don't know if that's an issue with the file, the USB drive, or the TV.  Aspect ratio modes are limited in USB mode:  I only get the option of \"Original size\" or \"Full\" (which expands the video to the entire TV).  I haven't had any problem yet with the \"Full\" setting because all my video files appear to be encoded in widescreen formats.The LED backlighting is adjustable, either by changing the AV mode (standard, cinema, sports, etc) or by setting the power saving feature to \"Auto\".  At full strength, I see some LED light vignetting at the corners of the screen when there's just a black image being displayed.  (I see the same thing on my LED PC monitors).  By comparison, the shade of black present in the vignetted areas is still blacker than the blacks produced in the video.I don't have much to compare it to, but the remote works just fine for me.  It took a little bit to figure out how to get to all the features (especially the 24P Cinema Mode, which is a couple menus deep).Sound is just fine for my tastes.  The volume runs from 0 to 100 and gets plenty loud enough to be too loud when sitting about 7 feet away.  Sound quality is fine and actually has a pretty good frequency response range...it's not tinny or muffled.  ClearVoice does add some crispness to voices.TruMotion is kinda neat.  It \"interpolates\" and inserts additional frames which really smooths out motion on any video I've fed it so far.  Sometimes the results are desirable...sometimes not.  On a \"I am Legend\" DVD, for example, setting the TruMotion to \"Low\" smooths out the video and adds to the quality in my opinion.  It does add a little bit of the \"Soap Opera Effect\"--unnaturally clear and smooth video when compared to traditional 24-frame per second movies, so I just turn TruMotion off if I don't like the result.  On some of my HD video from the USB drive, TruMotion makes motion more blurry, so I just turn it off.  Again, the benefit seems to be dependent on the frame rate and quality of the original video signal.The 120Hz refresh rate and the 24P Real Cinema mode are all about displaying film and video at their native frame rates without the need to do \"pull down\" frame rate conversions to the video signal which can cause judder (stuttering).  I'm still learning about \"judder\" and \"pull down\" so I really don't have anything to compare good vs. bad video quality.  I can say that I don't experience any stuttering no matter what DVDs I play.I love the quality I'm getting out of this TV right now and it's only going to get better when I can actually feed it full 1080p signals.  I will definitely look at LG LED-LCD TVs when it comes time to buy a bigger TV for the living room.I learned a lot about this TV's features by reading the online manual at LG before I bought.  I now have the CD manual which is 178 pages and goes into a lot more detail about what the TV can do.  If you want a copy, send me an email at rgknowlton at hotmail dot com.********************3 month update.  I now have an LG BD570 hooked up to the TV and I think the TV is amazing.  When fed a full 1080p signal, the picture is absolutely stunning (Planet Earth, Life, Avatar, etc.)  I've fed it everything from 380MB TV rip files to full quality MKVs.  I am very pleased with the quality:  Even the quality of the smaller video files is more than I expected from normal viewing distances.  DVD upconverting through the player also displays beautifully on the screen.  Once in awhile when I try to play VOB files from a hard drive, the TV won't expand the image to full screen, and once in awhile I get a video that the TV won't play (e.g. no CODEC for it).  It certainly isn't enough to bother me.  Whatever the TV won't play I can usually play through the BD570.  Between the two, 9 out of 10 files play correctly.  I like the TV so much I'm seriously considering one of its big brothers for our main living room TV.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect for Blu-ray and Gaming", "Author": "Matthew Gilmore", "ReviewID": "R2WNWSRQTCQQUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this HDTV off Amazon about two weeks ago, and I am beyond pleased with it. I replaced a 26\" Vizio 720p LCD with this. The features that really drove me to this TV is the LED backlighting and the 120Hz processing. This TV has a stunning picture quality with some of the deepest blacks and great color. The 120Hz TruMotion has really gotten me though. It makes everything much more realistic, almost to a point to being scary sometimes. Watching Blu-rays with the TruMotion on the highest setting almost takes you out of the movie. It's beyond cinematic, and it seems like I'm just looking out a window watching the actors in real life. It's not bad by any means, and in fact, I can't go back to not having it, but it may be too much for some people. You do have the option to adjust it, and you can even turn it off altogether.I use this TV currently for the following devices: an Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, Gateway PC, and Comcast Digital HD package. Gaming is great. I've noticed everything I've played so far has been super smooth and the response time is phenomenal. I've tried the following 360 games on it with great results: Halo 3, Need for Speed; Shift, Alan Wake, Modern Warfare 2, and Split/Second. The Wii looks a bit worse on this TV than on the small Vizio, but I imagine it's the increased screen size. I have the Wii hooked up with component cables and set to 480p widescreen, but playing Super Mario Galaxy 2, The Conduit, No More Heroes 2 looked kind of bad. I know the Wii is not an HD console, but it's a bit disheartening to see some of the better Wii's graphics downgraded. Now, with the PS3, I don't game to much, and I've yet to play a game on it with this TV, but as far as the Blu-ray goes, it's been outstanding. This TV is enough to make me just skip the theater and wait for movies to release on BD. Blu-ray movies have such amazing clarity on this set, and the 3-dimensional feel is incredible. I played The Dark Knight, and the movie is so deep. With this kind of picture, I think I can wait a decade for 3D HDTVs to prove themselves more worth it to me. My Comcast HD looks nice, too. I know it's not 1080p, but there's no complaint. The TruMotion is great in the case of sports, and watching Braves baseball is more enjoyable due to it.I'm loving my TV, and I'd say traditional LCDs should be no more. LED is so much better, and the LGs are priced very reasonably. I can't believe I got this for $850.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good choice--", "Author": "Clever Name Goes Here", "ReviewID": "R25V2V2HXUWU22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the other reviews have stated, this is a very good display; I won't go into the picture quality much since that is well covered. I bought this recently based on the positive reviews here on Amazon, and I am completely satisfied. I got this to upgrade from a 720p Toshiba from 2007. Prices of HDTV's have gone down so much, I decided it was as good of a time as any to make the move. I had never purchased anything from the Korean based LG prior to this, but based on their overall good reception over the years I decided to go for it.So, as I mentioned, the picture is well documented as being excellent on this set, and indeed it is. I was a little curious as to what an LED screen would be like, as I have only had devices with regular LCD screens in the past. The viewing angle is still very good; perfectly fine for any viewing position that people will consider 'normal'. The main advantages of the LED screen are that, for one, it uses very little power, and two, it allows the display chassis to be incredibly thin- despite being a 37\" screen, this set is only around  1.3\" thick, which is not only neat looking, but also makes it less bulky and relatively light for it's size. I was able to set this up by myself with little trouble, and that is something I appreciate. The box is thin even, and although a little cumbersome to move alone, it is not at all impossible.Upon opening the package, my first impression was dealing with the stand... and honestly it was not the best first impression. I already knew the picture quality of the set was great (I checked it out at a local store ahead of time)- but assembling the stand was more work than I was expecting. The Toshiba stand (from my former set) was very easy to assemble and disassemble. It had high quality, precision machined screws that mated flawlessly with their respected openings. The LG set was not as painless... the screws are of good enough quality, but use standard a '+' screwdriver to install, unlike the Toshiba, which had hex screws which are (from an engineering standpoint) more durable and easier to manipulate. Not a huge deal... but getting the screws to line up took the most time. I was very careful because I did not want to risk letting the screws strip their engagements in the base, and getting the 4 base screws all aligned was tricky. I was able to get them all to engage without excessive force, but it took several tries. Bottom line, once the stand is put together, it is fine, but I will not be taking it apart when I move the set in the future, because I do have concerns that it could be damaged from repeated assemblies/dissembles.In the box there are the other normal things you would expect; remote, batteries ('Rocket' brand?), manual, and other standard things. What caught my eye where the 2 unusual mini-plug adapters included. This leads to the strangest thing about this set--The inputs on the back can be seen in the features, and I have no complaints about them- 3 HDMI, 1 component; the regular gamut you would expect. This set does not have a baseline analog audio out however, so note that if you want to route audio out, it's only going to be through the optical-digital output. So, anyway, the mini-plug adapters... so, this set has 'side' mounted inputs, as is common on most TV's these days. For some reason though, LG's designers decided to have the side component video input, as well as the side composite video input, both be in the form of mini jacks that require these adapter leads to use. This is pretty inconvenient, the only reason I can think that they did this was to save a couple bucks on manufacturing costs, but I really don't know... maybe some cameras use these mini outputs directly?There is also a side mounted HDMI, making the HDMI input total 4. Additionally, there is a headphone out, which is a nice perk that you don't see on every set out there. One more thing to note about the side inputs; they are so far behind the set that any cables you have plugged in won't protrude out into sight, so you can just as well leave things plugged in without it looking tacky. I would really call them 'side facing rear inputs'.Lastly- everything else is great. The set has an excellent GUI (Graphic User Interface) menu that is very intuitive and simple to understand, yet it isn't watered down in what it lets you do. Also, all the adjustments you can make have visible numerical values, which is superior to the useless generic 'bars' that some sets have. The remote is bare bones, but well laid out for the most part, and aside from the somewhat odd 'clicky' middle arrows, works great for getting around the menus.My test subject was an xbox 360 connected through HDMI, running at 1080p. Everything was sharp and clear, and (with a few adjustments) the colors where rich and pleasing, but not overly 'sweet' or overblown.Overall, I am completely pleased with this purchase. The stand could be a little friendlier, but the actual set is stellar, so I am not going to knock points for something that ultimately has no effect on your viewing experience.*Update-Now that I have had a chance to use this set more extensively, I thought I would add a couple more insights, as I know I personally find these user reviews really helpful in making a choice, so I want to try and pass that along- but anyway-The USB port on this is actually pretty neat. I didn't think I would really use it, but I have actually found it handy for watching video files off of my flash drives. The display's browser works well, and lets you navigate folder trees, make playlists, and pretty much offers all the functionality you need for media use. I also found that you can connect a card reader, in my case an SD USB card reader, and this lets you view images directly from your camera's memory card. Although you need a reader, this is a good option over sets that have specific card slots, since USB will adapt to work with everything.I have also used it more extensively as a computer display. If you are fortunate enough to have your PC near your TV, you can enjoy the benefits of running this as a second monitor. I have a 5 year old video card (NVIDIA), and it has no trouble running this at 1080x1920 in addition to my monitor. Note that you can simply use a DVI to HDMI cable if your video card doesn't have a an HDMI output.Having a 37\" monitor is pretty nice, though note that the resolution, by computer standards, is only average. That said, this is actually pretty usable. On my 720x1366 32\" Toshiba, computer images where too cramped to be that great, but 1080x1920 gives enough breathing room that you feel like you are using a proper display, not just awkwardly using a TV as a computer monitor. Obviously, this is not going to replace a 'real' monitor; the dot pitch on HDTV's is not as good as even inexpensive dedicated PC displays, and eye fatigue will strike faster here... but, once you adjust things (turn the brightness down...) the image quality is surprisingly good; I was amazed at how accurate colors were compared to my PC monitor (which I often use to check colors for printing).Ultimately, as a monitor, it is a bit of a novelty, but for entertainment purposes (you will not want to read much text on it...), it is a pretty neat set up to try out. Plus, it really reveals how slick the picture quality is in this set!One last note- As has been pointed out, this set does not have analog audio outputs, but the nature of how the headphone jack is positioned (on the side/rear, recessed fairly far in), you can just connect a mini adapter to route analog audio out if you really need to.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overall performance of LG LCD 37LE5300", "Author": "DMORG \"DWM\"", "ReviewID": "R3OFXTHUJ4IWRA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This LG HD LCD 27LE5300 this is an overall exceptional HD Television. The Qualify, Reliability, Performance and ease of use is the best TV performance I have experienced. I have a Samsung 52 inch HD TV and an Westinghouse 32 inch HD TV. Neither matches this LG HD TV model. The only drawback that it has is that LG does not include a paper User Manual. They provide a CD disc with the the User Manual. Since my LG is not even on the same floor as my TV, when I needed a particular answer for setup, I had to run downstairs and look it up and then run upstairs to try to apply what I looked up.  This sometime didn't work and it was back to the computer. I ended up printing numerous pages to setup the TV correctly.

I'm huge on customer reviews and read everything I could get my hands on about different brands and kept coming back to LG. I've only had this set for a little over a week and so far so good. The picture is great, it was extremely easy to set up (it took me longer to attach the stand (it was an issue of trying to use the wrong size screws) than it did to set up the TV) and I couldn't be happier. The only real problem I had was with the HDMI connection. I thought I also needed an HDMI cable so purchased one only to find out that the converter box I had from my cable provider didn't have an HDMI port. I called the cable provider and found out I needed an HD converter box which was going to cost me an additional $10 a month to my already staggering monthly TV bill.  I gave in when they tempted me with a free DVR. Anyway, when the technician came to hook everything up, he asked me a very simple question. What did I use my TV for? He said that one of the biggest traps that people fall into (especially when they don't know much about this sort of thing) when they buy an HD LCD TV, is that 9 times out of 10 they don't need an HD connection at all.  He said if I were a big sports enthusiast, watched a lot of live TV or hooked my computer up to play games then I should by all means get the HD connection, but for regular TV viewing I didn't need it. He thought the picture was great on the LG and so do I. Since I'm not much for sports or those other things, I cancelled hooking up HD for the time being.  At some point, I'll succumb and do the HD thing, but for now I'm happy with a great TV and look forward to watching more amazing television on it. You will have to decide for yourself if you want HD or not, for me and my budget, saving $10 a month on something I don't really need is huge to me.The only complaint I have and I understand this is going to change because of Federal regulation is that I have to adjust the sound from time to time. This has nothing to do with the TV.And, actually setting up or programming the TV was very easy. I was worried about whether or not I'd be able to do it without LG tech support on the phone, but it really couldn't have been easier.I recommend this TV and the size is pretty great. I thought about buying a 42\" set but am happy with this \"smaller\" size, any bigger and I would have had to set up my favorite TV viewing chair outside in order to watch it without being distracted by seeing pixils rather than picture. Take that into consideration when you buy a TV, if you have a really large room then a really large TV is fine, otherwise all you see are pixils (the little dots that make up the picture) rather than just a TV picture.Hope this helps with your selection.

Two trouble spot appeared for us... one was with initial set up. It did not go through what was described in the instruction pamphlet, and I truly thought it was not working at all and would have to be sent back. Somehow, it started to work fine after a long delay. That was frustrating, but it worked.The second trouble spot continues intermittently and infrequently: the sound volume starts to climb all on it's own, and cannot be lowered, and once this starts, all controls on the TV and the remote stop responding.  The first time this happened, I was very startled and thought the TV was having a meltdown. It took a few minutes to realize none of the controls would work at all and I finally just pulled the plug. That solved the problem... the only way to stop the blasting sound (that jumped all the way to max) is to unplug the set for several seconds and plug it back in. This returned it to normal function. This has happened 3 or 4 times in the last couple of months. Not fun, but not terminal. Of course, this could be a problem limited to just a few of these units.Aside from these issues, the picture quality (resolution, contrast and color) and sound are fine, and we are satisfied with our purchase.We are also pleased with the size we chose... the 37\" in. screen fits nicely into our TV cabinet and is large enough.

When the price droppped for this one, I just couldn't resist to pull the trigger. TV just arrived yesterday and the first thing I checked for was the 7 digit code on the box: AUSWLUR. Then I said to myself, \"Great! Awesome! It's a W not a D\". What this indicates is this panel is an IPS panel, not the inferior VA panel.Setup:This setup was easy. It took me less than five minutes to install the swivel stand and connect my Verizon FIOS STB to the HDMI input.Physical Appeal:The black glossy frame and stand look terrific in our bedroom. It's thin and only weighs 40 lbs. Something that your wife will be more concern of than the picture quality. Also, the matte screen is what I personally prefer because we have two windows facing the TV.Picture:Picture looked mediocre in the beginning until I used the LG calibration function in the menu. HD channels look fantastic as espected, but what really disappoints me is the quality of SD. Obviously, the unit doesn't have a good enough filter, or may not even have one at all to filter out the noisy picture. Doing some custom tuning will improve SD to somewhat acceptable, but it'll still be far inferior to any Panasonic TV out there as Panasonic outputs SD content so well that it can fool people thinking they're watching HD. I recommend anyone who purchases this LG TV should do their own tuning rather than using the preset picture modes. Watching static picture like David Letterman on 1080i looks even better. No ghosting spotted when watching football thanks to its low response time. However, one huge letdown that buyer needs to be aware of is backlight bleeding. I start noticing backlight bleeding from all four corners after a week of watching. The top left corner is getting so bright that it's even affecting non-black color around that corner. So having an IPS panel doesn't guarantee you have a good TV.Audio:Don't expect any high quality trusurround sound coming out from these tiny speakers on this paper thin panel. The sound quality is just okay. At least I'm not hearing any fuzzy noise so far. If you're serious about sound, you always have the option to hook up to your external speakers.Gaming:I have yet to test out my PS3 and Blu-ray movies, but seeing how well it displays HD content for my FIOS TV with no lags in sport, I shouldn't expect anything less.PC:It connects to my HP laptop just fine via HDMI, but about 0.5\" is cutoff on all four sides no matter what resolution I set to, but I can tolerate that.Conclusion:-1 for SD Quality, and -2 for Backlight CloudingIt's sad that this TV has to go. I would have kept this TV if it wasn't for the backlight issue, which is the only problem that I can't tolerate. Knowing that I get less than 50% chance to get another IPS panel for this LG, I'm going to have to try out another brand. Keep buying and returning until I get another IPS panel with NO backlight issue is not fun, and it's definitely bad for Amazon's business.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV for viewing a Flip video camera", "Author": "D.

Originally I had been focusing on a Panasonic set, but they discontinued that model and the replacement exceeded the 36 inch cabinet I have to work with.  Thanks LG the set fit like a glove!  Out of the box set-up was simple, just 8 screws to set the base to the LED/LCD set... this set-up is not as simple or versitile as experienced with my Samsung models but is still easy for anyone to do.  One other area where LG can improve is  Samsungs always come with an easy idiot-proof set-up sheet, while the enclosed 30 page manual you have to leaf through to ensure proper set-up... hope LG is listening. LG does provide a DVD with more instructions, the paper manual ends with putting the unit together and hooking it up. The LG is a very generic looking set, another area where Samsung appears to have an upper hand with their touch of color etc... but for the $599 price tag I have little to complain about. The set comes with 3 HDMI connections which is really great and purhaps a bit of an over-kill, Once assembled hook-up was a simple task.  I didn't bother reviewing the DVD and the initial set-up of the TV was intuitive thus a relative breeze.  After the initial set-up I went into each Menu item and adjusted each category to my liking.  This is an area I give a thumbs up to LG over Samsung, I feel it offers more choices.  I would agree with other reviewers, the basic sound from the system is very average, I find myself constantly raising the volume on shows I'm watching to relatively high levels.  The 6 year old Samsung this set replaced rocked in this area.  The other feature I prefer on the Samsung over the LG is when I'm switching video sources.  The Samsung you just hit the source button and it cycled through the availiable options automatically.  The LG you have to choose the source (menu comes up)you want to see and hit enter...it's not a deal breaker but the Samsung is just simplier.  Having this TV just one day I find the picture to be great, although it's hard to see much the difference between the canned choices... one thing for me to follow is whether this set maintains the settings you put in the system.  I did go back in a few times and found the setting I had established mysteriously changed.  On one occassion I though t this might be due to the change in input source from my cable box to the Blue Ray player, if this is the issue that may not be so bad thing. Overall I htink I'm going to be real happy with this set, Samsung Sony Sharp and Philips offer few 37 inch sets today focusing on slightly larger so I guess they will lose a few customers like myself who want the largest possible screen in a relatively tight configuration", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, Solid Construction, Think about your viewing angles prior to purchase!", "Author": "pedrochin", "ReviewID": "R3OMKDZJN2GBVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great LED LCD TV for under six hundred.

There is a somewhat noticeable blooming effect coming from the corners when the display is dark, but not enough to be particularly distracting.  I would have loved an IPS display, but the VA really isn't bad.  Certainly not enough of a difference to warrant packing it up to send it back and waiting another week to *maybe* get the other.  Clarity is fantastic, the sound is good, and PS3 games + blu-ray looks AMAZING at 120hz.EDIT 2/18/11:  After much use, it seems the blooming is getting considerably worse.  Before where it was a slightly noticeable smudge in the corners, now is flooded with giant grey splotches.  I am going to contact LG directly about receiving a proper replacement, as I know retailers like Amazon and Newegg have no control over which ones they receive and get sent out, and I don't want to play the lottery over and over again.  Will report back, but in the meantime, my 4-star review is dropping to two.EDIT 12/2/11:  It's been almost ten months since purchasing this TV, and although I was pretty upset at LG for refusing to replace the TV since there technically wasn't anything \"wrong\" with it, things have gotten surprisingly better.  The blooming in the corners has gone completely away, and the viewing angle is very wide especially for a VA display, as we've now mounted it fairly high on the wall and colors stay true at nearly any angle.  It looks like the TVs without IPS require some burn-in time in order to display properly.  The blooming went away after about six months of use, which of course is still ridiculous but offers a bit of hope for those who lost (and keep on losing) the panel lottery.  2-star review going up to 3-stars.  I won't bring it back up to my initial 4-star rating due to LG's poor customer service and shady manufacturing practices.  No one should have to wait six months to get the product they actually paid for.EDIT 8/6/12:  A year and a half later, the TV is performing well.  No more blooming, the colors are true, and the sound is pretty good despite being mounted to the wall.  Image is clear and I love 120Hz for sports and gaming.

It started right after Thanksgiving, when I decided to chuck the old SONY 27\" CRT. I asked my knowledgable technocrat at the IT department at the college where I teach digital imaging. Distilled down, he said \"get an LED LCD, make sure it's an IPS screen\" After a search, the LG 37 seemed to fit the bill. Hey it's 10\"s bigger than the old CRT, and Hi def too! Ordered one up and unpacked and set it up with no problem, though I did want to run the sound through my old Sansui stereo system. I chose a GefenTV GTV-DD-2-AA Digital to Analog Decoder GTV-DD-2-AA to convert the Optical audio out of the TV to L/R RCA stereo signals. The resulting audio is hot but totally manageable and quite good. Now the bad part. The TV worked great with bright scenes, though the optimal angle of view was narrow. When the scenes went into night or overall dark, light bluish splotches were evident in the corners and the middle. I lived with it for a week, and finally decided that I didn't want to live with this flaw. Amazon readily agreed to send me another at no charge for delivery or return. At first, the replacement was scheduled for Jan 5th, but the next set came in about a week. Amazon was offering great but slightly confusing customer service. The set was unpacked and setup, and the first TV sent back. Then I noticed that there was a lottery going on. I read reviews about the set here on Amazon, and then I checked the code on my replacement set. Sad to say It was a D set. Not IPS. Oh well, if it didn't have the splotchy dark screen display, I would keep it.... but upon setup, this one displayed the problem too. Not as bad, but easy to see, and distracting when viewing content with dark scenes. So, back it went too. I requested an IPS screen, and Customer service (second tier) said that they couldn't guarantee a W set (IPS) but felt that because the replacement set was coming from a new source it likely was to have an IPS screen. While waiting, Amazon sent an eMail saying that due to the magnitude of the problems with this set, they could only offer a refund and that I should return the set. The next day I got confirmation that the replacement was on its way! So I guess this set made it under the wire for the panel lottery described in earlier posts. Well, two days before Christmas, the set came, and It's a beaut! I am very pleased with this IPS set. Great color, and even black screen in the dark scenes. I bet when Amazon sorts out the distribution, it will be a best seller. While the process of getting an IPS set was harder than it should have been, I am happy with the results. As usual, Amazon took care of my purchase, and I finally got a great TV. One tip for making the set look great is to turn down the backlight to something like 35.

It looked great out of the box, slim and elegant. However, as soon as I turned it on I knew I had a problem. On a black screen I could clearly see a huge (about 6' across) white cloud right in the middle of the screen. When I add in the poor sound, the poor viewing from any angle other than dead ahead (yep, I got the VA panel) and noticeably worse picture clarity, compared to Samsung UN series, I knew I had made a mistake.I called the retailer, 6ave, and spoke to a rep about the issues. He was knowledgeable about the problems, was sympathetic and issued me a return label. I packed it off and replaced it with a Samsung UN40D6000, which is amazing. No problems with the retailer at all.Poor show by LG to keep shipping a product that they know has variable quality and a poor specification. This is not how you gain respect in the marketplace, a competitive marketplace at that.My advice; stay away as there are so many better options out there.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic picture, rather poor sound", "Author": "Gray Beard \"G WIZZZ\"", "ReviewID": "R1TLMK38L3SI8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "But poor sound is something this set seems to have in common with so many flat screen sets.

I decided to have LG repair the picture rather than sending it back. The LG 3rd party \"All Brand\" in Pittsburgh responded fairly quickly and ordered another replacement screen. Unfortunately, the replacement screen had a crack, so I was back to square 1. I decided to order another one from Amazon but Amazon was out of this particular model. So I ended up purchasing it from BestBuy for $699 who had one at the store which was still a good deal, since I wanted it as soon as possible before Christmas. I would not hesitate to order a TV from Amazon; it arrived 2 days later and Amazon refunded my money. UPS came to the house to pick it up. It was not their fault that it was defective. My only complaint was that during the process of ordering it, a sales person stated that a special UPS person would install the TV to ensure that it works correctly. This is false on smaller LED-LCD's. I was told that this is correct on larger TV's.

So, here goes:1. Reading/following the written instructions for stand assembly and attachment will seriously slow-down most folks --  the actual process is quite simple: There are 3 parts to the stand, and 2 bags containing 4 screws each (long set & short set). Attach the aluminum plate to the base using the 4 long screws, then slide the plastic cover over the aluminum plate before attaching the assembled base to the back of the TV with the 4 remaining short screws. If any of the screws seem difficult to tighten, then STOP & reposition the associated parts until all the screws turn smoothly in their intended sockets. At each assembly step, leave the screws slightly loose until all 4 screws are installed; this will permit repositioning if needed, to get all the screws properly threaded into place. Then, tighten the screws fully so that there's no detectable looseness or wobble in the stand. Now, you're ready to place the TV upright. As a final check on your assembly, make sure that the TV rotates smoothly on its base.One of the small details that made a BIG difference for me in choosing this unit, is the matte screen. I'll be using this TV in an area that's generally well-lit and I can already see that the screen is free of annoying reflections.(I shall return)OK, back after less-than 1 week, to report that my TV is being returned to Amazon due to a screen defect (getting increasingly washed-out~too bright in 2 corners).

Everything was fine until I started seeing some issues with how NetFlix worked with the HD quality movies. Fearing it to be my Cable connection, I switched to Qwest. No luck. So I started reading reviews and noticed the complain about the clouding issue and it was exactly my problem. So then I started reading more and found that AUS\"D\" that I had was a VA panel and might be the reason for this. I called LG and they confirmed that I have a VA panel eventhough they claim in their Knowledgebase that anything above 32\" uses IPS panel. So sent it back and got the new one exchanged hoping I get lucky this time. Turned out to be a VA panel too. Thought I would keep it , but then I started noticing quite distinctly the black becoming grey when I move from the edge of the sofa to the center. Looking at some reviewers here, I noticed that COSTCO had some IPS panel and went there to check. No luck. All the pieces they had were VA panels too. (from the serial #). But they had 42 inches on IPS panel. So I asked the guy at COSTCO to put the 37\" VA and 42\" IPS side by side. He did so after I explained my findings so far. I could quite distinctly see the difference. IPS had no shading even at very obtuse angle. That was it. Amazon all along was very good with my exchanges, but this one was going to go back for a refund. COSTCO with its extra year of warranty meant that my 42\" was coming in. Bought the 42\" and compared the 37\" at home  side by side in exactly same settings and sure enough, IPS was the WAY to go. VA was significantly lower quality. The blu ray I had purchased was for Netflix and internet and that had to go back too. The Sony BDP-S370 did not allow playlist view like PS3 did. So it was not the greatest piece either.

As such I try to give each TV time prior to judging. I have been a fan of LG (LCD)in the past (see other TV reviews). This is my first LG LED TV. And while the picture quality is good, its not sharp. I expect sharper more vibrant images in LED tv's and by far this TV seems to be more LCD than LED. The panel is ultra-thin in keeping up with Samsung... but by far the picture quality and brightness weren't to be found. So reasons to buy an LED TV - Reduced Energy Consumption, Sharper images, and brightness... Unfortunately, this TV scored on one - in terms of energy efficiency. But in terms of picture sharpness and image brightness - this TV just did not deliver. Blacks are a more like dark gray and the colors not so vibrant when comparing to a Samsung. As for price, this TV right now is $599 which is about $150 less than a 40\" Samsung. But I must say that I would strongly recommend that you spend the extra $150 and pick up the Samsung UN40C6300. Its as comparable (spec wise) as this unit but 3\" larger. As far as \"halo-ing\" I was unable to see any from a direct view perspective (straight on). I was however, able to see color uniformity issues (especially with blacks) when I was of angle. So is this TV impressive? By no means is it. What is it good for? Well for thise on a tight budget and want the latest LED technology, this will fit the need. But if picture quality is something you crave go Samsung. If you are avoiding Samsung just get an LG LCD. Their LCD's are superb and I'm sure you can get better picture from their LCD's - but you sill sacrifice unit-depth as LG LCD's are thicker than their LED'sYou certainly get what you pay for in this unit. 3 Stars out of 5 for its bargain basement price.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome LED TV...best bang for the buck", "Author": "D. \"Doc\"", "ReviewID": "R4H4IJDKLG8A8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ThisLG 37LE5300 37-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED LCD HDTV is a great LCD/Led TV for under $600, I mean you just can't beat the picture quality, features and value.

The remote itself feels good in my hand *not too heavy, not too light* and the buttons are a decent size and easy to navigate through. As far as the sound is concerned... I have the volume up to about 14 and it is quite robust. However, if a person has a large room or den, I imagine that a nice surround sound system would further enhance the quality even further.

Though I have speakers hooked up - the system spkrs are of better quality - there's a feature which brings voice to the fore and makes them much clearer to hear. The picture is brilliant - I have not seen a better picture elsewhere. It may exist but I haven't seen it. Also, I won the panel lottery :) got IPS panel technology - needless to say, I am happy.

The picture is amazing and flows smoothly. The color is very cool. Installation was as easy as ABC. The sound is good at its best.  My negative impression: - The TV plays some music in my external hard drive but not all. The TV says some of the music files are `empty' while it plays other files.  I tried to figure out what's wrong but I couldn't. The manual says nothing about type of music files it play. So I am disappointed of that. All these problems are non existent when I play it on PC or laptop.  If you are planning to use the USB portal of your TV as often as I am, look somewhere else.

After seeing only the \"D\" in stock for the 37 inch at Best Buy I purchased via Amazon the 42 inch of the 5400 series, hoping less Panel Lottery in the 5400 series, but I declined to accept the \"D\" that was sent to me. Google LG and Panel Lottery for more about the Panel Lottery. Better to purchase in Best Buy or another store, seeing for yourself on the box whether it is the superior IPS Panel.All the display models for 5300 & 5400 at Best Buy and at Sears looked great, and Internet research indicates most people love these TVs, if they get the right panel. So, I've given it 4 stars, not to reduce the overall rating of the product if it has the IPS panel. I did see only \"W\" in stock for the 32 inch in both 5300 & 5400 at Best Buy so at leasst in that size, there are IPS panels available, but I'd like a bigger size.Edit: IPS (In Plane Switching) panels are better, for viewing angle, and other reasons. Panasonic 37 inch ads & sets proclaim that it has a IPS panel, but it has a glossy screen. I want the matter screen that LG provides due to the light in my place. Unfortunately, the Best Buys that I've seen or telephoned only have the \"VA\" (Vertical Array, marked on LG boxes as \"D\")for the 37 inch in 5300 series. I telephoned a Best Buy today about the 42 inch 5400 series, and after checking the boxes, the staffer told me they have only the \"D\" Nothing on the Internet indicates to me that the 42 inch of the 5500 series has anything other than the IPS panel, so I ordered that today from Amazon and hope it will work out. Professional reviewers don't think the \"local dimming\" on the 5500 series improves anything, but it can be turned off. The 5500 series cost more at $1100 (today's approximate discount price) but all the individual people who comment on sites like Amazon seem to love it.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor choice", "Author": "R", "ReviewID": "RAXXBXVPP2LZF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The features associated with this LG 37LE5300 37-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED LCD HDTV were very poorly described in the Amazon and LG web sites. The TV comes with paperwork directing the owner to a web site where the manual can be downloaded. The menus are awkward to use and there is no program guide feature native to the TV set. The picture settings are fixed and I've not been able to have the sound come on at a reasonable level; apparently the sound automatically resets to LOUD every time the TV is turned off. If there is a way to change the auto on volume I refer to my earlier comment about the poor documentation. The time settings on the TV do not appear to have the ability to sync with real time and I find the TV time drifts about 5-minutes each week. Had I not thrown away the packaging when the TV arrived I would have attempted to returned the set after one day of use!

Before this is done they all have to pass the same inspection or they will not be used.The manufacturers are telling us that there is no difference.
