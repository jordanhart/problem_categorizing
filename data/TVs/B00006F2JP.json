{"Reviews": [{"Title": "JUNK JUNK JUNK!!", "Author": "Joseph M. Rounceville \"Joe\"", "ReviewID": "ROSB86Z27E0WG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok folks, this thing is pure junk.  I bought this thing in September of 2002 for over $700.  It was manufactured in July of 2002.  In September 2004, it went dead, and started hissing whenever it was plugged in.  An authorized RCA technician came to our house and looked it over.  He determined that the flyback transformer was bad, and it had shorted out a transistor as well.  The estimate to replace the flyback and the transister came to $300, and the technician couldn't guarantee that something else wasn't damaged--only that those two components definitely _were_ damaged.  Of course, RCA only provides a 1 year warranty, so it's not covered, and here I am, 23 months from the date of purchase, and I have to go buy a new TV.  The technician said that RCA seems to be having troubles with flyback transformers right now as well, so it's not like I was an isolated example.Stay away from this loser.", "Date": "September 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "ITS GREAT", "Author": "M.
