Setup the unit, everything seemed fine after a DVD test drive.  I got the cable run and the TV quality was poor, but it was expected for this no frills system.  Connected a set of headphones into the headphone jack and that was the end of it.  No sound at all (either headphone or built-in speakers).  The remote is also terrible...no range and you must be directly in front of the unit for it to respond.  Audiovox support is of no help.", "Date": "January 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "Jeffrey A. Sanders", "ReviewID": "R3A6OGU1KX6BIL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great price but the changing channels on the remote control seems slow.  Also the remote control strength seems to be very weak even after I changed the batteries.  Also the uasability of changing channels is not great.  I am using this in the kitchen and it does the job it is also nice to have the built in DVD player so I get to have a DVD player in my kitchen with out taking up more counter space.  Also sometime the TV does not work and needs to be \"rebooted\" unplugged from the outlet.Bottom line is it is a good choice if you don't mind the inconviences and don't want to spend alot of money otherwise I would not recommend it.", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fine product", "Author": "Adrian Ascanio \"Adascanio\"", "ReviewID": "RRH7I77DAQRQG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 6 months of using this product I still enjoy the look of it and the quality of image, as well as the possibility of watching dvd, vcd, cable and antenna tv, and even listening to cds on it. It's true that the sound quality and volume are not great, but for a bedroom or kitchen tv the product does just fine. The remote isn't bad at all, lots of functions, settings angles, zoom, etc, all is there, in a card like format, light and it even comes with colors to help identify functions. I have played many dvd formats, including computer burnt stuff, most of them work here, which is a plus for this unit.  Overall I'm happy with the product.", "Date": "April 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "wonderful", "Author": "Stacey M.

The only thing I wonder about is how difficult it's going to be to disconnect the cable. The TV connector turned when I tightened the cable connection and I didn't tighten it any tighter than I've ever tightened any other cable connection.

There turned out to be many problems with this television.  First of all, I could not find an antenna that would allow a clear picture on the 5 stations that the television identified.  So on the night of the Academy Awards we set-up the television in the living room and decided to \"screen\" a DVD on the TV.  About an hour into the movie, the DVD player locked up and all we could do was eject the DVD and move into another room to finish watching the movie and subsequently the awarda ceremony.  The volume only goes up to 30 which nade the DVD difficult to watch for persons with hearing impediments. I am returning the television, and am going to buy a convertor box.", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "HD-ready 15-inch flat panel LCD TV; measures 18.5 x 12.7 x 7 inches (WxHxD)\nIntegrated slot-loading DVD player; 1024 by 768-pixel resolution; 500-1 contrast ratio\nCompatible with 1080p/720p/480p/480i HD formats\nInputs: 1 composite, 1 S-Video, 1 component, 1 RF, 1 VGA, 1 DVI\nBuilt-in stereo speakers with SRS virtual surround sound capability", "Name": "Audiovox FPE1505DV 15-Inch LCD TV with Built-in Progressive Scan DVD Player", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PB3Q1S52L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00081K4CU"}}
