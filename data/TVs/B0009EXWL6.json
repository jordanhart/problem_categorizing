It was definitely the way to go -- great value for the money and it is cool that we are ready whenever the cable/braodcast world goes HD.  The color is brilliant, features are extensive (a little confusing at first) -- sound is good even when not using our 5.1 DTS.  There is a very explicit warning about \"burn-in\" from channel logos, tickers, freeze-frame images, etc. but I think (hope) this is easily managed by avoiding such images and adjusting picture size.  Also be aware that the picture-in -picture (PIP) is limited in the sense that the TV itself has only one tuner -- but a second source and tuner (like a VCR) should work.  We have enjoyed many favorite movies and some new ones too since getting this TV three weeks ago.  You will see detail you didn't know existed and discover that those beautiful movie stars actually have complexion problems like the rest of us.  We used \"The Wizard of Oz\" as the benchmark to evaluate this TV, because is is so familiar -- and the richness of this 66-year old classic is nothing short of astounding.  Also -- unlike another reviewer reported, our picture needed no adjustment, and the settings you can adjust we did not find difficult to use.  A negative: when the delivery folks arrived they did not set up the TV, as promised in the Amazon description.  This was the most unnerving aspect of the whole transaction but everything turned out fine.  If you love movies this is a terrific TV.", "Date": "January 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a Great Price", "Author": "M. Douglas", "ReviewID": "R8TMJ48UNRQ2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I were looking for a large TV to occupy some serious wall space and were directed by friends to look at DLP for the \"long term\" benefit.  After being warned by several about the dangers of plasma burn-in, and the gaudiness of the old-school rear projection TV, we did some independent research and a lot of store viewings.1.  DLP is crummy from any angle other than directly in front.  The bulbs range in time from several hundred hours to a couple thousand - which means that during that crucial playoff game, you're back to your old school 25inch CRT, relegated to the guest bedroom tv.  That's the real reason you kept her around.2.  Rear Projection is pretty much the same, albeit cheaper for the same quality, and should come with a pre-installed Magnum PI and Knight Rider video show because this is the TV of the 80s.3.  This newest generation of plasma TVs is less likely to burn-in than my old CRT, and  have the means to correct the burn-in if images start to appear at any time. Which means permanent plasma burn-in is BS unless you are an airport, school, or other public information conveyor that never checks their equipment.  I checked and we apparently aren't, so we looked closer at the plasma option.  Bottom line:  Plasma looks brighter, better for longer than any other TV out there.  When I'm standing 70 degrees to the side, I can still see the whole picture - when I push the on button, I don't have to wait and pray that the lamps will heat up without popping.  And in spite of my love for old school tv shows that will probably never make it to HD, the plasma looks great for anything on it's gloriously sleek screen - standard or hi-def.Samsung has a winner here - the TV was cheaper than I could buy on a military base without tax, and it was delivered quickly and took almost no time to set up.  There are plenty of connection options, and the menu options for setup are so simple, I can actually understand them.  The TV was 90 lbs - so it isn't flimsy in any way - and the design is pleasant, not overstated, and nowhere near as instrusive as a rear projection box.  We've already put about 150 hours on the tv, and no problems (other than the addictive quality of playoff games in HD - you can see the texture of the grass, the game ball, and the announcer's toupee - it really is amazing).A word of caution:  In spite of the low price, this is definetly an enviable Keeping up with the Jones item. Be prepared to sever friendships and test loyalties after purchasing this tv - it makes you look rich without having sold children or body parts to get one.

The picture is incredible, it has all the imputs you'll ever need on the back, and it has great menu and settings adjustments.  DVDs look great (using component video cable) and HD broadcasts are jaw-dropping (bringing in FREE over-the-air HD with a regular UHF antenna).  This TV is just awesome.  The built in speakers are great for regular TV, but for movies or some of the better HD shows you'll definitely want to run the sound through a nice stereo.  What finally made me decide on the Samsung over the other plasmas out there was the design - its just a thing of beauty, and for me (an architect) design is very important.  My only complaint is the remote - it's functional and certainly does the job, but such a beautiful TV deserves an equally beautiful remote... Oh well.

When it finally arrived the new screen now has THREE bad lines on it, now in the middle of the screen.  I just got off the phone to Samsung.  They had lost the latest order from the service centre, from last month.  When I asked how long it will take to replace it from now the operator said \"No Idea\".

I hooked up an old antenna, the kind you just slide on the cable input---and wow, had it auto select the OTA channels, and was truly amazed. My local network stations come in crystal clear--over the air with an antenna! Very simple. So I am anxious to get the cable HD as well. But even if i did not get cable, the channels I do get are worth the upgrade to this TV. The HD quality is stunning, and I still can't believe I get this quality with an antenna I used about 10 years ago! So far only drawbacks; its heavy and it does not have front inputs, althogh I have not really needed them yet.  This HDTV was a good buy and I am extremely satisfied with the results.

Adams", "ReviewID": "R31ZWN2T99OGKS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung HPR4252 after allot of online research and reviewing.  I also currently own a Panasonic '42 plasma.  The first Samsung ordered and received was defective out of the box and since I ordered it through Amazon they were un-willing to replace it or provide a refund do to their policy (make sure you read the return policy).  The second one I ordered was from another supplier who gave a 30 day unconditional replacement if the unit proved to be defective.  For anything over 27 inches I recommend you purchase the product from a supplier with this type of 30 day replacement. While the Samsung is stylish the picture issues with \"ghosting\" and pixel distortion is far more prevalent than the Panasonic.  At times the picture is fine at others it is clearly distorted.  The exception is when viewing HD.  In this case the picture is great.  I have had the cable company out to check signal quality, called the manufacturer, talked with the vendor and get various answers as to why since this poor quality is also with DVD players and any type of cabling connection I use.  The bottom line is that side by side the picture quality is far superior on the Panasonic and I don't have the same pixel or ghosting issues as with the Samsung.  The Samsung is more stylish but its features end there.  Price wise, Panasonic and Samsung are very comparable.  The one feature they both don't have is an easy to use sleep bottom on the remote.  Bummer.  If I were to do it again I would stick with Panasonic and purchase the product from a vender with good customer support and return policies.

In 2006 we purchased a Samsung HTR4252 for around $2200 from Amazon on-line.

Bleeding colors, multiple images and washouts have made viewing impossible.
