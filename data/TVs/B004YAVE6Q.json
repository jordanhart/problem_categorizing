I was going to buy it from Walmart but saw that Amazon offered it at a lower price and with free delivery. I was a little worried buying such a big ticket item online and was not sure if it would be delivered to my house in one piece. I was plesantly surprised to have no problems with this item. It is working wonderfully and couldn't be happier with the quality and the price!!", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Meets above what I thought I was getting", "Author": "Marc", "ReviewID": "R3LKRPB1TNFW2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv provides quality that even some high brands dont provide. This was unexspected but a relief. Picture is bright clear and crisp. The only down fall is how bland the speakers are. Very little bass but i have surround sound when i watch a movie. The biggest surprise is that i thought i was getting a 60hrz however i ended up with a 120hrz. I am very happy.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV, Great price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1CXJB7P9TPMVH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV now for about 6 months.  So far, I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I had a 27\" Sony Bravia prior to this as my main tv, so for me 47\" is a HUGE upgrade.  The picture is just as good as the Sony, and the sound is pretty good as well.  To be fair, I have it hooked up to a home theater system, so I can't really judge the tv only sound fairly.  This is not a top of the line tv.  It's not 3D, it's not the biggest screen on the market, and it doesn't have all the internet gadgets.  But I have an external streaming media device already, so I didn't want to pay the extra $$$ for that feature.  Even if I didn't already have one, you can buy one new for less than $100 making that an opportunity to save $$$ instead of paying the premium for the internal internet controls on some tv models.  3D is fairly new, and I'm not sure yet it's here to stay, or if it's a fad.  If it is here to stay, it will get better in coming years so I don't personally think it's worth buying now unless you have money to burn.  But, one thing I am fairly certain of, if it is here to stay, the pricepoint of this feature is sure to come down in coming years, making it more affordable in a few years or so.  For me, the higher end tv's were not worth the at least twice as much, and in a lot of cases three times what I paid for this perfectly competent and good tv.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Flat screen tv", "Author": "K.

The deal was the problem.  It came in a box that had been repacked, the warranty card had been filled out almost a year ago and the power cord would work somewhere other than in the United states.  I salvaged a cord from a printer and hooked it up.  I will probably not make large purchases from Amazon in the future.  Their third party suppliers are typical internet businesses who link to reputable web sites and deliver rebuilt and represent the stuff as new and have almost no way of communicating any issues.  I should get an adjustment for not sending the set back.

Ive had it running as a primary Tv for my family for over 2 years now and couldn't be happier. The blacks could be darker but overall the picture is great.

Amazon picked it up within 24 hours with no hassles to us (except repacking it). We spent a few extra $$ over our budgeted amount for a TV but it was well worth it. The picture is fantastic and clear from over 15' away. It was easy to set up in our home and connect to our satellite, DVD, and Wii. However, we've not used the Wii yet with this set. I would definitely purchase again/recommend to a friend.5/09/13: The \"mother board\" went out two weeks ago and we have not been able to get the one person in a 20-mile radius to get out to the house to repair it. He estimates it will be around $200 to fix. I will not buy Toshiba again. This TV is on less than two hours a day, more on the weekends and holidays. Who knows how long it would have lasted if we used it more.
