We don't watch broadcast television, we got it just for DVDs. If you are a sports fan, or plan to be the first on your block with Blu-Ray, you might want to consider going for a higher end model with 1080p, but this TV is terrific for movies. The aspect ratio and size is a welcome step up from our old 35\", and the features and connectivity are understandable and convenient. We've had the TV for a month, and our unit has performed flawlessly. One of our concerns was possible fan or color wheel noise, but only if your ear is close to the TV (and everything else is off) is the fan detectable. The brightness and contrast are excellent, and the color rendition was natural right out of the box. The sound is unexpectedly good, we haven't bothered to hook it up to an amp.

I know alot of people on here have given Eagle a bad wrap, but I must say that my experience has been nothing but positive. I ordered my tv on saturday, it shipped on monday, and I received it on friday. I must admit, though, I was initially worried because Amazon said that the shipment was going to take almost 4 weeks...thankfully, it didn't even take a week.When we got it set up, the only thing that I could think was \"WOW!!!\" This tv is freakin' HUGE. I paired it with a Philips DVP5960 upconverting DVD player. The picture is amazing with DVD or HD CableTV. I'm using HDMI cables with both (don't spend over $100 for those...the $17 cables from newegg work just as well).For people considering LCD/Plasma, consider this - I did:1. Plasma or LCD are going to cost you a minimum of $2000 more for an equivalent sized unit.2. Plasma/LCD have a display life of ~5 years with a steady degradation in image quality until failure.3. There is no means of re-charging the plasma or refreshing the LCD - currently. So, after it's image is gone, it's gone and you've sunk several thousand into it.4. The DLP/Rear-projection set has a constant image quality until the lamp goes out.5. I can change a bulb in 2-3 years and be good for 2-3 more for ~$250. At that point, I would have only invested ~$1750.*******************************UPDATE (08/25/2010)********************************Four years into ownership and this TV still rocks. I finally had to replace the lamp for $120 and about 10min of my time. I still think this was a great purchase!!!", "Date": "September 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Trust your judgement", "Author": "P.

I read every opinion, shopped lots of locations, both on and off the internet and ultimately decided upon the 56\" Samsung. I must admit that I was quite skeptical at first of making such a large purchase on-line and having to deal with whatever nightmare might arise from it. I can honestly say that after just three short days, my breathing has become as steady and clear as the picture on this incredible television. This is quite a unit. Very simple instructions walk you through the installation. It virtually took just minutes to complete. I do plan, as I'm sure most of the PROS will tell you, on \"tweaking\" with the many adjustments that are offered on this set. But right out of the box, it looks watchable to me. If you're worried about the perfect green and/or the absolute flawless of contrast, you have it all at your fingertips of a rather functional remote control. I plugged in three different colored component video lines, poked the cord into the wall and VOILA . . . high definition television. Bay Area delivery was handled by Eagle Logistics. I simply recorded the tracking number which Amazon provided and kept in close phone contact with the shipper. Once the shipment hit ground at SFO, I called and asked for dispatch, booked a convenient three hour window and happily received a dent free box of television.

The picture on most programming is really nice but on some shows it has lines and/or pixels; not sure if it is my signal or the TV, I have comcast HD; which the HD channels are great. I have in the past had a 50\" plasma (which I returned due to a humming noise that couldn't be fixed) and a 50\" Sony LCD projection (which I lost due to a flood; it worked excellent for the two years I had it). The plasma definetly had a better pictures for contrast and brightness; if you can live with a humming and the fact that they typically break more.I had considered the 1080p version however since there are almost no signals out there that are that high of resolution; whats the point.I also have a 32\" LCD tv and in my opinion it has the best picture compared to plasma; DLP and LCD projection. In hindsight I might buy a 40\" LCD and live with a smaller picture.this TV is easy to operate and has ample inputs.The problem I have had with the Smasung was the remote only worked from 3-4 feet from the TV; not very convient if you sit 12 feet from it. Samsung sent out a repair man and aparently it was just a little peice of plastic that was not removed during manufacturing was blocking the signal.I buy a lot from Amazon however I bought this from Butterfly Photo with a three year warranty and bulb replacement plan for $2080 including tax, and shipping.

Remember that the prices will continue to fall.  This model delivers excellent high definition.  I watched the Texas game last night on ABC and noticed metal flake in the helmets, condensation on the water bottles and a grasshopper on the bench.  My standard DVD's look better too.

The TV looks great and Halo 2 rocks on the big screen - just make sure to change it to game mode.  I saved so much money buying this TV from Amazon over an electronic store.  Here is the price break out:AmazonSamsung 56\" DLP  $1499Samsung TV Stand  $1834-yr Warranty  $1195 DayShipping  $50Total  $1851Electronic StoreSamsung 56\" DLP  $1999Samsung TV Stand  $2504-yr Warranty  $3995 DayShipping  $0TOTAL  $2648That is a difference of $797.  That is HUGE.The TV itself is great, but you really need to get the HD service to make it spectacular.  I bought a HD antenna, but didn't get any reception with it.  I can only assume it's because I'm too far from the broadcast station.The TV stand (TR50X3BX) looks very sleak with the TV.  It was easy to put together and is very sturdy.The warranty can be purchased through Amazon, but it is actually distibuted by another company.  When you search for TV warranties on Amazon, you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same, but are different prices.  I called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was.  They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.  So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.  The one diffence between the Amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the Amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the TV; but I figure if I need to replace the bulb within those four years I will still be saving $100 because I can get a new bulb for around $200.The shipping was great too.  I paid about $50 to get the 5 day shipping.  It was delivered to my door within 5 days; the delivery guy unboxed it and carried it in the house for me.  This is great for those who don't have a truck of their own.I am very happy with this purchase and look forward to many more nights of watching football and playing Halo.", "Date": "September 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!!!", "Author": "Brian Aday", "ReviewID": "R3EVY9TLTQHUXH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been waiting and waiting to purchase a big screen and finally chose this one.

I saved over $700 buying it from Amazon instead of at Best Buy or another store.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "BIG Screen HDTV At An Affordable Price!", "Author": "Michael J. Gratis, Sr.", "ReviewID": "R26F8K0KLM0UNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With the price of large, widescreen HDTV sets dropping, and after thinking about it for the last 2-4 years, we decided that this would be the year we upgraded our 20-or-so year old 27 inch Zenith CRT TV for a larger, widescreen TV that would truly allow us to enjoy our DVD collection, as well as Dish Network broadcasts. Initially, I was looking at a low priced 50 inch CRT rear projection model that was on sale.After doing extensive research on-line, as well as going into numerous stores and comparing countless sets and various technologies, including DILA, LCD & Plasma, we decided that DLP technology would give us the most bang for our buck with the most pleasing picture and settled on the Samsung HL-S5686W as being the best investment within our price range. I would recommend that you decided on a price range that is comfortable for your budget and then narrow down your choices from the available sets within that price range, trying to center on which features are most important to you.  Otherwise, you will continually find yourself trying to justify spending \"just a bit more\" and then actually spending substantially more in the end.  The 56 inch screen is bigger than the 46-52 inch screens we had been looking at, though the price difference wasn't that much, and it shows bright & colorful realistic images. It is slightly matted, so there is no glare from the windows or lights in our living room. There is no Screen Door Effect that we noticed with every LCD TV we looked at. With DLP technology, there are also no concerns about burn-in or the degrading of colors over time. The projection bulb, which will eventually need replacing some years from now, with the length of time depending on how many hours a day you use your TV, can be removed and installed by you, so there will not be a potentially expensive service call needed. This also ensures that the colors are just as vibrant 5-10 years from now as they were when the set was brand new. There is a very thin border around the screen, so the case doesnt detract in any way from viewing, and it is also both shallow and lightweight. If you do not have a home theater audio system, which I highly recommended, there are stereo speakers built-in that will give decent, acceptable sound. There are a wide variety of connection options to the rear, including HDMI and component video. There are also audio & video connections on the right side for attaching equipment, with digital & video cameras as well as all of the various gaming consoles immediately coming to mind. Speaking of gaming consoles, there is a Game Mode setting that is supposed to provide optimized settings.  In addition, there is a USB port, called WiseLink, which can be used to attach flash drives, MP3 players, digital cameras and such for viewing or listening. The menus are easy to navigate and are pleasing to look at, and they can be adjusted for transparency to your personal tastes. The remote control is easy to use, once you get accustomed to it, and it is programmable for other audio & video equipment.As for the picture.... With my Apex DVD player hooked in via component connectors, I viewed Finding Nemo and found the picture quality to be truly breathtaking. I was immersed in bright, vivid colors and crystal clear video. Everything was so sharp, with lightning fast action and no lag time noted. At some point you felt like you could swim right into the picture! Sitting from 10 feet away, I felt like I was in my own private movie theater, which is exactly what I had hoped for. I used the THX calibration available on the disc to fine tune the display and found the picture even better!  I'd say that at least basic calibration of any HDTV is a must, as the settings from the factory are usually overly bright and saturated.  From what I have read on-line, a newer DVD player with progressive scanning and an HDMI connection should even be better, which is not only hard to imagine, but something that I will definitely look into after the Holdiays. That being said, be aware that the digital picture quality is SO good that it will also show *any* flaws in the source material or any problems with the broadcast signal. The larger your screen size, the more this will become glaringly apparent. This is true of ANY of the modern HDTVs using digital technology. Keep in mind when viewing TVs at the stores that they are trying to give you the best signal they can to sell you on High Definition TVs. Also keep in mind that some TVs may be properly calibrated, while others are not so side by side comparisons are not always so cut and dried. The picture will look utterly fantastic with DVD & true HD materials and broadcasts, but Standard Definition material, including broadcasts from my present Dish Network Model 4900 receiver, will show numerous imperfections, and possibly even a blockiness and pixelization. I especially noticed this on certain Dish broadcasts, probably due to both poor source material and the MPEG-2 compression methods used in the satellite transmission. Once again, please note that this is NOT a fault of the HDTV! After the Holidays, I may look into upgrading my Dish receiver to an HD model or setting up an antenna to see if I can get Over The Air signals in HD. I have found that keeping a distance of 10-13 feet from the screen greatly enhances the viewing of SD material, as the closer you get the more you will notice the degraded picture quality. Additionally, if a specific broadcast is more annoying than others, I found that using the Movie Mode helped.  Be aware that once you view HD anything in SD is always going to pale in comparison.All of that being said, I cannot recommend this set enough! If you want the absolute latest technology with 1080p resolution, be prepared to spend more, MUCH more if you start looking at more connection options and LED projection lamps, but for most normal folks, this set with 720p-1080i, with 720p actually looking better, will do it all and do it very well at a very reasonable price.", "Date": "December 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "the best tv set i ever owned..b8r than most lcd", "Author": "Susan M.

It is light-weight and easy to move around.  The stand is actually heavier and you have to put it together, however the quality is good and the stand is good looking.The TV picture is excellent, with four modes to choose from (I use the 'standard' mode mostly, 'dynamic' is very bright).  You can view the picture quite well from angles, though straight-on is obviously the best. Sound on the TV is excellent as well (for a TV).  Menu controls are easy to access and intuitive (no brain surgery here).I also chose this TV because it has PC connectors for video and sound, right from the PC.  I connect my PC because I have many movies on it.  You could use the TV as a huge monitor if you want to browse the Internet.NOTE: My research showed you cannot connect a 'normal' DVD player and expect a HQ picture.

I bought a wireless keyboard - with mouse built in- from Fry's, and now I really enjoy surfing the internet from my couch.I bought this TV in February '07, when amazon had it on sale for $1,250 with free shipping.  What an awesome deal.  Since we got this TV (which dwarfs the 30\" CRT that used to be our living room TV, but now lives in the bedroom), we've been watching everything from standard def to HD to tons of DVD's -- upscaled by our Sony upscaling player (also great, it remembers the position of the last 6 DVD's and movied played on it through HDMI look wonderful).  The difference from before we got the TV to now is so amazing it's hard to describe.

We now host a weekly LOST viewing every wednesday, and are looking for a new show to watch with our friends every week now that LOST is in reruns.  My money is on Entourage.My DVD collection has grown by leaps and bounds since I got this TV, largely thanks to blockbuster's awesome and frequent used DVD deals.  But, I digress, back to he TV.  I love this TV so much I feel like I ripped Amazon off.

YMMV on that.Pros: Great picture (after you mess with the menus a bit)  Can't beat the price for this screen size with any other technology.  Great Build Quality (after 4 months of ownership)Cons: It'll need an expensive new bulb sometime next year at the rate we're  putting hours on it.

Here it is December 2011 and I still have the same ( original) bulb. The set has often run for over 48 hours straight ! I worked shift work, would come home, fire it up and proceed to fall asleep on the couch. Wake up and watch a football game, etc. where the TV played on until the following evening. I will agree with some of the reviews that the sound could be better, but I would have to say that is the only shortcoming I have had with this set. I also like its ability to use the picture zoom feature. This is handy when a camera view of,for instance, a football game, is backed off too far to see the action best.  I realize the set is now over 5 years old, and a dinosaur by todays standards. However, I plan to run this baby into the ground. When the bulb does finally expire, I will most likely buy and replace it myself. I am still hesitant to drop $2K + on another TV.

Not actually a pixel of course because DLP is based on tiny mirrors and the image is projected onto the screen from about 12-inches behind the screen. The dot eventually turned black. No big deal, as it was the size of a pinhead admidst a 56-inch screen.However, over the course of the next two weeks more dots appeared, as if the TV contracted chickenpox. There are now over 100 of these dots, some white and flashing and some dead and black, and they are continuing to develop, virtually rendering the television unusable at this point.Of course, after the 1 year expiration there is no warranty back-up from Samsung.I called them and they said a technition would call me to set up an inspection, but this was over a week ago now and I have not received a call. Also, I know it would cost $50-100 just for an inspection, and then to repair the TV I assume will cost me hundreds of dollars. Not worth it.Sad that a $1200 TV has only a 3-yr lifespan.No more DLP for me, and will probably now be conned into purchasing extended warrenties on future TVs.Although disappointed I will make the most out of my new TV-shaped gigantic paperweight.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "memo79", "ReviewID": "R1JWSDQQG7YP3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great television, awesome picture.

I called Samsung, because there was a 1-year warranty on this thing, and 3 days later a tv repairman was there to replace the bulb.  Excellent service, no problems at all.  Now here we are 4 years later, and the bulb is barely hanging on.  I think this is awesome for a DLP tv.  Yes, the first bulb went out after 5 months, but the mfr promptly replaced it for no charge, and best of all I didn't have to use my extended warranty from BB (they only cover 1 bulb replacement during the warranty term).  Luckily (or sadly, if you're the glass-is-half-empty type)it has lasted me 3 and a half years.  So now I'm off to replace the bulb on my own, and maybe the color wheel while I'm at it, cause I've read that that's the cause of the buzzing noise upon turning it on/off. Bulb can be found here on Amazon for about $100, and the color wheel for a few bucks more at $120.

Video games using the component cables look really nice too btw...could only imagine how nice a 360 or PS3 would look.I think that if you're really picky about video quality you'd be better off paying more for the 5687 in order to get the 1080 and the better contrast ratio but if you're like me, a tightwad, then for the most part you can't go wrong choosing this one.Also, please make sure you need a tv this big.  If you are closer than about 12 feet to the tv the picture will look suboptimal and you'd be better off getting the 50\" version. If I had to sit closer to this tv I would really be disappointed.Oh, Samsung gives you a one year warranty and if you buy it on a major credit card your card company may (mine did) offer to double the warranty for free.

There are 2 RF inputs, so this TV works great with a cable input with NO cable box (I really don't like cable boxes.) and a second input from an antenna to receive over the air (OTA) high def programming. I was pleasantly surprised by this and am glad I didn't need to get a cable box to view high definition channels.This TV has a great picture and color. My one complaint is that it doesn't seem to scale standard definition (4:3) pictures to wide screen as well as my Toshiba 32\" LCD which performs most of the stretching on the edges of the picture. This TV seems to uniformly stretch the picture, but it's so big that viewing the images at 4:3 is not a big deal.", "Date": "January 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV Outstanding price", "Author": "Waffle of Justice \"WoJ\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z9I3ES86BZ3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You cant say enough about this TV, and the price is unbeatable.

With the arrival of the TV came HDTV service from my cable provider. Great sound, picture quality is good, (the screen is a tad grainy-please don't confuse this with snowy, I'm talking about how the picture is reflected onto the screen),the HDTV broadcast shows significantly more clarity. Please don't opt for the free freight, my estimated delivery time was 10 days, it arrived at about the 3 week mark. The setup was a breeze and fine tuning was also easy.The great downfall of this TV is the pixelation caused by too much action or very bright objects being displayed. It was annoying to watch The Fantastic Four and lose clarity when Mr. Flame says Flame On! Sporting events also seemed to cause this.Overall for the price I'm very happy with the product.

Warner \"Maximus\"", "ReviewID": "R150XY0PJXRPIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After exhaustive research concerning brand, technology (DLP vs. LCD and 1080p vs. 720p) and size, I settled on this unit and couldn't be happier.The television is aesthetically invisible (notice the lack of big speakers hanging off the sides or a thick frame around the edge). Furthermore it is slim and fairly light. It has good number of inputs, but it is not comprehensive as some. It is quiet (I read complaints of the spinning color wheel), but I've never heard it. And no one has noticed the rumored \"rainbow effect\".Frankly, after ALOT of reading it seemed to come down to personal preference concerning DLP or LCD. I choose DLP due to its edge in clarity with images in movement since sports, action-type movies and games would be on the majority of the time.Lastly, the 720p resolution became the obvious choice. Simple economics is one reason, but overiding that was the complete lack of 1080p media available now or in the near future. Television programming may arguably never be able to obtain this resolution. Although next generation gaming consules support this resolution, a majority of games out now or in production aren't choosing this option for memory reasons. And finally until the Blu-Ray vs. HD-DVD battle is decided do you really want to invest in the possible next Beta or Laser Disc? Heck, even sales people at stores I spoke to agreed with this line of reasoning.I would add that Amazon had the best price for this unit I could find on-line after considerable searching, save one \"shady\" on-line source.", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Worst TV ever!!", "Author": "Adipolle", "ReviewID": "R3QOWWN816SC8Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Our 56 inch Samsung DLP TV worked fine for a year and then just become completely unreliable and shuts off every day.
