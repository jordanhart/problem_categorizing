at Walmart for 248. However the one I purchased in May gets infrequent use and I'm now starting to have concerns after reading literally hundreds of reports of people having problems with the Vizio brand and in particular this model. I can only rate this based on my experience, which so far has been good. But there is no denying that this model has a very high problem rate. Just Google it and you'll see what I mean. So if you do buy this, proceed with caution and it might be prudent to get an extended service plan as backup insurance. I will update my review if any problem develops with either of the two E321VL HDTV's that I've bought. Again, so far so good, i'm very happy with them and at 248, it's a deal that's hard to pass up. I just hope the TV continues to function without the problems that many people are reporting.----------I was in the market for an under $300, 720p HDTV and the only other requirements were that it have a couple HDMI inputs as well as an audio out in case I ever wanted to add a better speaker. My search began and my first TV purchased was a refurbished Philips HDTV, Philips 32PFL3506/F7 32-inch 720p LCD HDTV, Black. My brief experience with the Philips was not very good so I returned it and purchased this Vizio E321VL.For the $60 difference in price between the refurbished Philips and this brand new Vizio, the Vizio was heads and shoulders above the Philips in every aspect of performance, operation and aesthetics.Once you open the box you only have a few things to do before connecting the HDTV to your cable or antenna. You need to attach the base to the stand neck  with a thumbscrew. You then attach the HDTV to the base with 4-screws. Vizio even includes a decent quality philips head screwdriver for this task. The base does not swivel or tilt. You need to insert the provided batteries into the remote unit and you attach the AC power cable to the back of the HDTV. The last thing you need to do is to hook up your antenna/cable connection and you're ready to turn the HDTV on and begin the setup process.The setup takes just a few minutes and you are walked through the steps. Essentially you simply need to select your timezone, whether you want daylight savings time on or off and finally you are walked through the channel scan.The HDTV has a good variety of inputs and outputs, particularly for the price point. You have 2-HDMI inputs, a composite video input, PC input if you wish to use the HDTV as a PC Monitor, stereo RCA input for hooking up an external audio device, stereo RCA audio out, optical/SPDIF audio out, and a  USB port to enable USB stick photo slideshows. That's a pretty decent set of inputs and outputs.Compared to the Philips HDTV that I returned, the sound from the Vizio's built-in speakers was surprisingly good. Much better than the Panasonic TC-L32X1 32\" HDTV that I currently own,  and better than the Samsung LN22A450C1D that I have in my bedroom. All of those TV's I mention have bottom/rear firing speakers that just don't get the sound out to the viewer very well. The Vizio has front facing speakers that not only sound good but project the sound so much better. It's almost like having a soundbar under the HDTV. The sound does lack bass but that's pretty much the way it goes with these built-in speakers. But still, the sound is quite good and I'm pretty picky about sound. You can easily hook up an external speaker if you wish using either the stereo RCA audio out or the optical/SPDIF output.The brightness of the screen is fine and the viewing angle is quite good. Some TV's really suffer in this area. As soon as you move off axis just a little bit the screen brightness and sharpness just drops off dramatically... not so with the Vizio.The remote control is not too bad although the buttons are a bit on the small size.It is quite amazing to me how much quality you can not get in a 32\" HDTV for under $300. I am very pleased with my purchase and will update my review if necessary to reflect any issues or problems that may develop.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "A First Rate Value", "Author": "Sammy Clemens", "ReviewID": "R2URE5Z86E7W1V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought one of these at a popular deal-a-day site. Including five bucks to ship, it was under a deuce. Yes, under a deuce.It's worth MUCH more than that - a very pleasant surprise. For most people's purposes, the resolution, refresh rate, etc. are more than adequate. At proper viewing distances, you will not discern a difference between this and a much more expensive TV.Set up is easy; the tuner is really, really good, and pulls broadcast channels like a champ. A bit of googling will uncover lots of proposed settings to tweak the picture. The set has some fairly useful ones built in (\"golf,\" \"movie,\" \"standard,\" \"football,\" etc.) but tweaking can make a difference.The sound was even a pleasant surprise. Not great, of course - this is not a 'home-theatre-in-a-box', after all. But the front-firing speakers are much better than I'd have expected and beats any of the smaller LCD TV's I've heard.We've enjoyed sports, streamed movies via a laptop, DVDs played via laptop and via DVD player ... all excellent. You can even use it as a monitor for your laptop, though I think it's going to take some serious tweaking to make that worth doing - text is not good ... some sort of resolution issue.Never thought a low-end 32\" LCD could be as rewarding as this has already been.UPDATE - Nov.2: The set's still great, but we've added a heavily discounted Pyle amplifier (thanks, Amazon!) and a pair of Pioneer BS41 speakers purchased through a \"deal-a-day\" site. Once you find the proper settings in the audio menu on the Vizio, this set-up absolutely rocks. It's still only stereo, not surround, but it sounds really good. All in, we're talking about $400, and we couldn't be happier. For any relatively small space, this setup is ideal. It's got us seriously looking at Vizio products for our larger viewing area as well.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "good buy", "Author": "rahul", "ReviewID": "RGR1135XW8BVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first LCD TV.

I should call again and I repair order would be issued. Vizio has a policy that while the purchase is still under warranty a replacement will be given only if repair fails. It did happen again, I called and the repair was ordered. Tech didn't show at appointed time. I wasn't willing to waste more time making yet more phone calls and requested a replacement. After 2 hrs on the phone talking to several different Vizio customer service reps I regret that I ever bought this TV since it seems that Vizio punishes the customer for Vizio's faulty products.I cannot recommend buying this product as -judging from reviews - lemons aren't uncommon and as a customer you can't expect any reasonable treatment from this company!", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast shipping, great product", "Author": "S.

Wortham", "ReviewID": "R14GRVCMBZ401V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent Out Of Box Experience (OOBE).The stand was very easy to install and the box included a cheapy phillips screwdriver! Thank you Vizio for recognizing and addressing a very annoying issue. Little things like that make for a very happy customer.Batteries for the remote, two AA, were included also.The TV will need to be laid face down on a clear clean spot. Take a minute to make sure there is nothing, like the included screwdriver, in the way that might scratch your new screen. Last year, I scratched my new computer monitor like that on a power supply that was covered by a thin blanket on the bed.Setup was easy as pie. Just plug in the coaxial cable and set the channel input. We don't have an HDMI cable yet.Picture quality is excellent.On screen menus are intuitive for the most part. Lots of adjustments can be made - you can tweak broad parameters or nitty gritty.Here is a tip for you if you have DishTV. The picture was too big for the screen. I looked at a lot of settings but couldn't find the one that was causing this problem. Finally, with a lot of Googling, it turned out to be the *Format button on the Dish remote. Set the HD to 'Normal' and SD to 'Normal'. The TV remote is set to 'Wide'. That gives me a letter box picture that fills the screen correctly. We don't have an HDMI cable yet but I will update this review once we get one and switch over.Another bit of information that I gleaned - traditional coaxial cables are only capable of 480i resolution. You need at least RGB for higher resolution and HDMI is, of course, optimum. HDMI cables have version numbers. Unless you research it for your specific TV you'll want the highest version number you can afford. So watch out for clearance bin cables. It does make a difference. There are two broad categories of HDMI cables. High Speed and Standard. Standard HDMI data are rated at 76 MHz which is 1080i. High Speed HDMI are rated at 340 MHz which is full 1080p. Standard HDMI cables are fine for TV classes below 32 inch. Those TVs do not benefit from the higher bandwidth of the more expensive High Speed version.There are some conclusions to draw from the HDMI information I found. You can buy the less expensive Standard cable and rest easy in your purchase. Or you can buy the more expensive High Speed and future proof your purchase. The evolution of cable standards, reflected in cable version numbers, means that getting the High Speed now may be self-defeating since better cable specifications in a year or two will kill any advantage to buying the more expensive one now if you get no immediate benefit from it. The current highest version number is 1.3 as of July 7th 2012. Version 1.4 is on the horizon.This is a 6 foot one:BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet 6.6 Feet (2m) - Supports 3D and Audio Return [Latest Version]... in particular, even if you go with the shorter version, read the review by A. Dent about this cable. From what I've read, TVs 32 inch and up will benefit from the High Speed version....and this is a 3 foot one:BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet (3 Feet) - Supports 3D and Audio Return [Latest Version]Back to the TV itself:Really an excellent value for the dollar. If you aren't familiar with the Vizio brand, they are the largest LCD manufacturer in the world. They make LCD screens for other TV companies and computer companies.[UPDATE October 15th 2012]Wow! What a difference a cable can make! I recently got - AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard] - to use with the satellite box and this TV. The difference in picture quality is truly amazing. So, this 720p 32\" HDTV does benefit from an upgrade of the coaxial to HDMI. I have the HDMI version 1.4 which is the latest standard but I think any HDMI version with 720p or greater capability will give you the best picture you can have on the TV. Shop around. That one I linked is an Amazon Basics item and it is a great value.[/UPDATE]", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great but the Sound could be Better", "Author": "Cindy Windham, ME", "ReviewID": "R2AN3AUDO3ER7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture quality is terrific my only complaint is that the sound could be better.

It would turn on, the Vizio logo would light up, the Vizio name would appear on screen, and that's all it would do. I spent two hours on the phone with Vizio Customer Service, who assured me numerous times that they were, \"dotting all their i's and crossing all their t's,\" to help me fix the problem. The customer service rep asked me if it was plugged in. Yes. Were there batteries in the remote? Yes. Could I unplug the tv and hold the power button for 30 seconds? Yes. And? Well, after that little experiment my tv stopped working altogether.To make a long story short, Vizio told me that they would have a technician coming to my house to fix it and I could expect their call in two to three days. This is day five, and still no call from a technician. I called Vizio again today to make sure I understood right, that they would call me and I wasn't supposed to call them. Vizio confirmed that a technician would be calling me. I told them it has been five days. A very optimistic customer service rep told me, \"They might just call you today yet.\" Well, they didn't. And now it's the weekend, so I doubt I'll be getting any calls.The same customer service rep then asked me if I would like to purchase an extended warranty on my tv. I asked what it consisted of. \"It will run you about 70 dollars.\" She said. I informed her kindly that I've wasted enough money with Vizio and would not be interested in repeating this process again in the future.Needless to say, this is my last Vizio tv. It was great for the three months it worked. Even after it's 'fixed,' if the technician ever decides to call, I doubt I'll ever fully trust turning it on or off.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC entry-level HDTV!", "Author": "Waylon Piercy \"Vaya con monstros!\"", "ReviewID": "R2WV0D2SUEHBGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I raised the money to finally upgrade to an HDTV, I did quite a bit of research to decide which TV was the right one for me. A 32\" set was the largest I could acommodate, and all of my research indicated that the Vizio E321VL was among the very best in its class. This TV meets all of my expectations, and then some. Setup is a breeze, and the picture is amazing. It lacks some of the features present on higher-priced models, such as internet connectivity, but things like that are a non-issue for me(I can easily stream movies and TV shows via my Xbox 360 instead). The sound is  better than I expected based on some reviews, but I keep the set muted and use my 5.1 setup anyway, instead of the TV's speakers. The built-in digital tuner detected a good many channels that the decoder box Comcast sent me last year for my old TV did not, although some are duplicates. There are several picture mode pre-sets, and plenty of options for creating custom modes.

I was upset to hear that Samsung had issues with their capacitors and although they are fixing that, my screen still looks the same.  I went to Wal-Mart and found this TV for only $228! (Samsung was $399 in 2008) so prices have nearly been slashed 50% since then.  Sadly the cost to repair this Samsung is just under the cost of a new TV, not worth it!I brought it home and was very easy to set up, I already had an existing TV stand that mounts the TV to a frame that rises above the stand itself, so it was a swap in and out process.The features aren't impressive, \"only\" 720p, has only 2 HDMI ports, 60 Hz, but this is going in my bedroom where it's only used for the occasional movie in bed or waking up to watch the news.  I wasn't disappointed at all since I have a home theatre setup in the living room with a big screen and surround.Regardless, the image quality on these newer Vizios are finally on par with the bigger name brands (LG, Sony, Samsung, etc) and no longer suffer from a fuzzy image or bad contrast.  For $228 you really can't ask for more, I was actually impressed with the built-in speakers compared to my older Samsung.This makes for a great \"replacement\" TV or maybe if you are finally getting an HDTV for the first time.It measures 31.5\" diagonally just like other so-called 32\" TVs and you aren't paying for the marketing.There was a Westinghouse 32\" for $199.99 at Best Buy, but I didn't quite like the contrast/colour compared to this one.Overall, this is a great value.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Black screen of death", "Author": "Courtney", "ReviewID": "R14Y6F0O0Y1YKV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a student, the price of this television really appealed to me. :) I purchased one about six months ago, and it served me well.

Speakers: I love the sound bar across the front bottom which puts out a very nice stereo sound.  Unless you're a meticulous person who needs a big movie theater sound, you don't need to go out an buy a sound bar.  The stereo sound output is so good until you don't have to raise the volume level to maximum to hear the sound.  Screen quality: The HD screen picture is as clear as a bell.  After initial set up, the was no need to adjust the color because it was already calibrated just right.  I've had the 40 inch Vizio HD TV in my living room for 4 1/2 years now, and have never had a single problem with it.  And that's why I went and bought this Vizio 32 inch for my bedroom.

Wow!  It did!  Happy camper once again.  Until today.  Went through the whole routine, unplugged power cable, etc etc and soforth .... still no TV.This thing is solid state, no tubes to burn out, no resisters to get fat and bloated, no 'gun' to get out of sync.  It should last longer than two years!  It hasn't been moved between locations, certainly hasn't be dropped or beaten upon.  Just because the warranty is only one year should not mean the TV is unreliable after 12 months or even 24.  My old tube thing lasted more than ten years!I'll call the repair place tomorrow.  Hopefully they won't expect more than a new TV would cost.  But if they do, I don't think I'll get a Vizio.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Yay!", "Author": "mamapat50 \"Pat\"", "ReviewID": "R1FKDPR8DPKNPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I checked out this particular model in the stores in  our area.
