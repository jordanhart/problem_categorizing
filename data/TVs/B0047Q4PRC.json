{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "davidh1321", "ReviewID": "R26489PP571RFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw this on the Sam's Club website with the price of $628 and my jaw dropped. This being a practically brand new TV to the market has very few reviews, but I bought the TV anyway based on what limited information I could gather. Most reviews you'll find related to this product are about the older model so I will give you my 2 cents about this 42\" Sharp Aquos Edge Lit LED LCD 1080p 120Hz HDTV (Model: LC-42LE620UT).Is it worth it? If you are looking for a good quality TV at an affordable price, then this is it. If you're looking for a top notch quality TV then look elsewhere.My 1-10 rating for price/quality = 10Video performance: The 1080p HD viewing is extraordinary. This TV displays seemingly blur free motion with the 120Hz.My 1-10 rating for video = 9REVISED 12/9/10: How does it sound? Specs include (2) 10 watt speakers. The sound quality is below average of what I would expect. You can play around with the settings by adjusting bass and treble. The higher the volume the more faded the sound (probably because the speakers face the backside of the tv) which might be okay for a small room. Pretty much with this TV, your sacrificing quality speakers so you can have a slim video screen. If you want satisfactory sound with this TV, be sure to hook up a stereo or surround sound system with it.My 1-10 rating for audio = 5Additional comments:Edge lit LED: In my opinion, I don't really notice a better image quality with this being an edge lit LED TV, but it probably cuts down on the power usage. Go green right?Friendly user settings: This is a smart TV. It can automatically detect whether to use full screen or a boxed screen setting (for non-HD viewing so the screen doesn't look overstretched). There are several video settings to choose from which gives your viewing experience some flexibility (i.e. custom, bright, movie, & power saver settings)Plenty of hookups. 4 HDMI inputs. 2 component with audio inputs. 1 PC and 1 PC audio input. 1 ANT/Cable input. 1 standard video and audio input. 1 USB port. 1 headphone jack. And lastly 1 analog audio and digital audio outputs.In closing, I could have easily given this a 5 star rating, but because I know there are better TVs out there so I gave it 4 stars. I would like to add that I am very pleased with this TV and that I am happy that I bought it. I would do it again if I had to. It would be really hard to find a better quality TV within the same price range.Side note: Don't be mislead that this has the Quattron technology. I read a few reviews that claimed this TV has yellow added to its RGB color subpixels. It does not. Nevertheless, it does have great HD picture quality.UPDATE 12/9/10: To get the full benefit of true HD from this TV, be sure to invest in HDMI cable(s). Plenty of great quality cables at low low prices here on Amazon. Also if you're a movie lover like me, get a blu-ray player. The sound quality from the TV does not decline and the picture quality is unmatchable with a blu-ray movie. Even regular DVDs look amazingly better on a blu-ray player with an HDMI connection.UPDATE 10/19/11: I would recommend getting a video calibration disk to get the best picture quality possible (because the factory settings are very dark). Of course, you will need a blu-ray player to use it. I recommend Spears & Munsil High-Definition Benchmark Blu-ray Disc Edition [Blu-ray] I'm changing my original 4 stars to 5 simply because this TV has proven to be of great quality.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Magnificent TV", "Author": "P. Smith", "ReviewID": "RO3F0POJA3Q9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Firstly, I didn't buy the TV from amazon.com, I got it from dell.com where it was $649 with free shipping. So I won't say much about my experience with Dell's service except that it was fantastic. Honestly I have to say that ultimately it was the price that led me to buy this TV, but based on my knowledge and research, I knew that I would not be compromising quality by choosing a Sharp.The first thing I did after I took the TV out of the box was attach the stand. I had trouble getting the last of the four screws to go all the way in the bottom of the stand, but this was only a minor inconvenience as it does not cause the stand to be loose at all. Then I connected my mini cable box and started watching. The picture quality is in my opinion comparable to that of a Samsung or Sony of the same caliber. I spent hours researching different brands/models and comparing them side by side at Sears, Best Buy, Walmart, hhgregg, etc. Furthermore, I used to refurbish returned TVs at Amazon as an employee so I've dealt with pretty much every kind of TV (and its problems) that you can think of. The video quality is really superb in every detail and I haven't so far been able to find any problem or concern. The advanced settings all seem to work great for standard, HDTV and bluray, but I'm yet to play any video games on the TV since I don't play them.The audio is really good for a medium-sized living room which is what I have. I don't use a surround sound system currently, but I might eventually get one to go with this TV. That's not to say that there's anything wrong with the sound, it's just not exactly outstanding. I've never been too picky about the sound quality for watching TV and movies, but it might be a little disappointing to those of you who are harder to please. The set also has a PC audio input which is nice because a lot of other models require you to use an AV cable adapter to hook up your computer and get sound from it. Another nice thing is that the TV has side inputs for USB, composite, HDMI, and headphones but they're sort of hidden out of view so that when you hook them up, the wires don't stick out in front which would be tacky.There are only a couple little things to complain about and I've read about them in reviews on other websites too. The buttons on the remote don't illuminate and are instead gray in color which makes it damn hard to see in the dark, but I only really use my cable box remote anyway. The stand does not swivel, although I personally don't think I would ever need it to do that. Another thing is that I haven't found a way to rename the inputs on the menu, so when you go to switch the input from one thing to another, you'll be choosing from a list that says INPUT1, INPUT2, etc. But as you go down the menu it tells you which one you've currently selected.I think it's an incredible TV and not just for the price I paid. I would give it about 4.7 stars out of 5. Yeah, you can find a better 42-inch LED 1080p if you try hard enough, but I seriously doubt you'll find one with more stunning picture quality, which I'm sure is of the utmost importance to the majority of buyers.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Picture, Fantastic Price", "Author": "SkipMD", "ReviewID": "R25RFPRP6OITUL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I, like most people who have written reviews on this TV, purchased it from Dell for $650. I do know it was also on sale at Sam's Club for $630 for a while as well but I did not have one in my area. Onto the review:I was in the market for a 40+ inch 120hz LCD tv when I stumbled upon this. I had originally been looking in the $500 range for my said TV but I saw that this was listed for price mentioned above. Knowing that other 42\" LED-LCDs retail for about $200 more (on average), I decided to purchase it. Let me just say that I could not be happier with the value or the picture quality.Picture: The picture is crisp and clear. I have it hooked up to my Blu-Ray player and a surround sound system. The Blu-Ray images are smooth and very sharp. There is also the noticeable \"120 Hz effect\" as I like to call it, for commercials and some movies with the fast refresh rate where everything looks fake. That's pretty standard in what I've seen from a lot of other TVs. I have no complaints about the picture quality. I watch sports on this and every play is crisp. I never noticed any blur with my old TV and I certainly don't with this. However, I mostly watch football and basketball. If you watch something like NASCAR or golf I'm not sure how the movement of the cars and golfballs would look to you.Gaming: I play a lot of XBox 360 on this TV. I play games online without any issue. It comes with a \"Gaming Mode\" setting which apparently turns off the 120hz induced lag. I actually don't use it and I have not noticed any lag anyway. It's wonderful and the 1080p looks great, even through my component cables (I know, I should really use an HDMI cable with a TV like this...)LED-Edgelit LCD: I'm by no means a TV expert but I did my research into LED-LCDs. For those who don't know, the LEDs, whether edgelit or backlit, have problems where there can be extra light around the source of the LED bulbs. In backlit cases, it's behind the image and in edgelit cases, it's around the edge. So, for this model if you have the TV on but no image coming through you can see some \"ghosting\" and \"bleeding\" on the edge of the TV screen. However, when there is a movie playing there is no problem with that at all. Keep in mind that this light effect is only noticeable for a black background with no image coming through. The TV comes default with a blue background so you won't even notice it out of the box. Again, I've watched many movies with dark scenes and there is no problem with bleeding from the edges at all.Sound: not great, but when I watch TV it's fine. When I watch BR movies I use the surround sound so it's not a big deal for me. The TV does have a \"surround\" option where it synthetically generates a surround sound perception with its basic speakers. It works pretty well actually and for those with concerns, give it a try; there's a minimal but noticeable boost in quality.Stand: Not a swivel stand. I have a need for swiveling TVs but I imagine that a lot of people don't. If this is a concern for you, consider it but otherwise it's a nit-picky point.Remote: An average remote. I have my cable box remote programmed to control the TV. Some people might need a better remote like the Logitech Harmony. As for me, I'm ok with using it to turn on and off. Again the remote can switch to the surround sound effect on the TV as well as switching between picture settings too.Value: Excellent, especially in the $600-700 range. I'm sure the Sharp 810 and 920 models have the new Quattron technology (which this does not have) and a swivel stand plus some LED backlighting. However, this tv is thin, the picture is great and the value is tremendous. If you want a good picture quality with some of the latest technology without breaking the bank then this is the model to get. If you are looking for 3D, unfortunately this tv does not support it. However, if Sharp is willing to produce a TV of this quality and sell it for that cheap, then I believe at some point in the future they may make a very reasonably priced 3D TV as well.Anything else I'm forgetting? I'll occasionally check into this review if people have questions. Again, I'm not an expert but I am a very satisfied customer who would encourage people to buy this for the right price.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Throughly pleased", "Author": "Rashaun", "ReviewID": "R1X5KXXMDUL8VZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned the Sharp AQUOS LC42LE620UT for about a week now and I must say that I am quite happy I made the decision to by this TV. Delivery was pretty smooth...FYI I purchased this TV from Dell who uses Pilot Freight, I'm not sure what amazon might use but if it is Pilot as well be sure to call and check on your order once it is updated to \"Recovered at Destination\" otherwise there is a very good chance that your TV will sit there for more than a few days.The TV itself comes in a nice thin box which made it easy for me to maneuver it to its final destination, packing is quite simple, remove two pieces of foam and pull the TV out which is amazingly easy to do because for a 42\" its only about 30lbs. If you live in cold weather let the TV warm up for an hour or so before you turn it on LCD screens don't like being cold and you may damage the hardware. Set up is easy takes about 5-10 minutes, I did not use the stand I mounted onto my Wall which is fairly easy. As with most TVs no hardware is included for mounting.The first thing I noticed when watching TV is the difference between 60HZ Frame Rate Conversion vs. 120HZ is the movement is so crisp and clean it took me some time for my eyes to adjust to the beauty of how TVs were meant to be displayed. The Detail is phenomenal Sharp claims to have a 1,000,000:1 Contrast ratio and I have to say Compared to my old LCD Darks are much much darker and whites are so bright and clean no bleeding of colors its fantastic!1080p is great, when watching Blu Ray movies it looks as if the people are in the same room as you and PS3 games are sent to a whole new level of clarity.The sound is what you expect to get with 10watt speakers, kinda crappy but picking around with the in house equalizer and bass will bring some life into the speakers, but in my opinion just get a home theater set and forget about the TV speakers.Pros:-A ridiculous amount of HD connectors most are on the back of the TV so no wires will be poking out from the side-4 HDMI Ports, I Highly recommend that you use invest in some cables if you want to experience all the TV can do.-1,000,000:1 Contrast, amazing color depth.-120hz Frame Rate conversion realistic clarity and movement.-30lbs even my grandmother could pick this TV up.-Auto Dimming features based on time of day.Cons:- There maybe some light bleed out in the corners because of LED edge lights.- Keep all sharp objects away from this beauty high glossy frame susceptible to scratches.- Remote is cheap single purpose, better have a universal remote handy.Overall this is a great purchase for someone who wants to upgrade from the plain Jane LCD but does not want to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a True LED or the weight of a Plasma.

When the T.V. first arrived, I was a bit worried about the image quality.  Of course, I did have it hooked up with composite video cables and was not getting the 1080p quality image.  I was worried because I have a relative whose LCD TV is connected with a coax cable and his picture looks pretty good.  Anyway, after getting the right equipment connected (HD satellite receiver and HDMI cable) the picture was astonishing.  My wife paused a movie we were watching and commented that the picture looked so good you could tell the movie action was fake.  It's kind of hard to explain, but the picture is awesome on this T.V.  Here are the pros and cons as I see them:Pros:Stunning picture quality (what matters most right?)Lots of inputsFantastic price for size/type of TVCons:Sound is bad... sounds like the TV is in a barrel.  I purchased a Sharp soundbar to remedy this and now the sound is great.Cheap remote... purchased one of those fancy Logitech universal remotes and it is much better.I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone looking to get a modestly sized TV with a great picture and at a great price.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very nice TV for its price, you wont be disappointed", "Author": "H.

I have had problems with turning on the unit and when I call the help line, I always get another \"expert\" who doesn't have a clue. I ended up having to unplug the unit, let it set several minutes and replug it in to get it to come on.First they walked me through a 'factory reset'.  Next time, they were going to have a tech look at it but they never gave me the call back ( 24 hours they said) to know when he would come.  When I called back, they said I had to take it to a authorized center that was over 100 miles away.  I told them that was unacceptable so they offered to ship it to their depot for repair.  They told me I would get a shipping box via UPS within 2 days.After waiting 5 days, I called back and they said they were not going to ship it to the depot and that they had sent me an email. (not true, I scour my email account and nothing from them unless their name is Sandy and are selling time shares).  They wanted to walk me through another procedure turning off some kind of updates.  I played their game and now I have to leave it unplugged for 30 minutes or so before I can plug it in and get it to power up.Now they say they are sending me a data stick to update my version.  Evidently they sold me a tv with a substandard programing.  They assure me thay are aware of the problem and that this will fix it.  I am still waiting for the data stick with the programming upgrade.I have had nothing but problems with this product since I purchased it 4 months ago.  The last teck did tell me that I probably shouldn't have bought this one but didn't offer any further information as to why.I finally went to to the local Wal-Mart and bought a bigger TV for 1/2 the price (Sanyo) and it works every time.The kicker is that I bought this SHARP brand Tv because I needed reliability.  I am a 100% disabled veteran with chronic pain and I have difficulty sleeping at night.  I bought the Sharp so when I can not sleep, I could have something to occupy my mind until the pain meds started to work.  The one thing I DON'T need and can not physically do is try to get this POS working in the middle of the night.Incidently, the help line closes at 9PM central time and the techs leave at 6 PM central so they are not there when I really need them.I hate this TV and am disappointed in SHARPS commitment to service.  They do not call you back as promised and do not notify you when they change their mind about what they are going to do.  It is up to you do figure it out.My average phone time with them every time I call is between 20 and 35 minutes and I have had to call them 17 times in 4 months.  I am sure there are professionals there, I just have not had the opportunity to have them help me.Don't buy it.  Go for a company that truly cares about building a quality product and will fix it when it is obviously defective right out of the box.  Shame on SHARP, they know this unit was defective and they keep BSing me.  I am physically ill and just too tired to fight with them.

A good plus feature is the USB port which plays almost all AVI content off of a portable hard disk.The only 1 CON to report so far, is the way the video files on the USB drive are listed without a SORT order and randomly.

To be honest, if it hadn't been ordered from some obscure e-store on the other side of the country, I would probably be returning it.I'll start by saying the picture is great. For the price, I can't complain about the picture. The TV is light and sleek and looks good in the living room.Here are the down-sides:1. Limited output capabilities. This is the most frustrating thing about this TV. There is no HDMI out. There is no digital Toslink out. There is a digital phono output BUT, it will not output digital audio from an HDMI input. So, there is no problem getting digital audio into the TV, but if you want to get digital audio (5.1), out of the TV, you're out of luck. Your only option is stereo RCA output. This is very limiting on a modern TV for anybody who cares about audio.2. There is a noticeable white light blur that comes from each corner of the screen. It is most noticeable when the screen is black, but can also be seen in darker video scenes. It's annoying.3. There is a neon blue Visio \"V\" near the bottom of the screen. In itself, it wouldn't be much a bother, but the thing flashes EVERY time you hit a button on the remote. So if you are turning up the volume or changing channels, it's like a disco.4. You cant rename the inputs. I knew this before I bought it, but it is more annoying than I imagined. The last TV I had, at least the active inputs showed up at the top of the list for easy switching. Inputs are always listed based on the number, not indicating what type of input it is until you have stopped on the input. And the way the inputs are numbered is totally illogical.If I had it to do again, I would not buy this TV. On the last TV I had (a Samsung), I plugged everything in and it just worked. Everything was very logical and user friendly. I have spent HOURS configuring this thing, and I am still just not totally satisfied.I'm just going cut my losses and call it good enough.
