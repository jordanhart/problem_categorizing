The sound quality was not good and it required external speakers.  This one has a much nicer look, sharper picture and the sound quality is great.  The only issue i've had with it so far is the remote sensor is on the very right side of the TV so have to make sure i point the remote a little better.

So, I took weeks to find the TV and a few weeks to play with it.Tonight's the night where I can finally feel free to write this review.First off, if you're like me, using this for a PC display is going to be slightly problematic. But that was with the HDMI cable. Not to get to technical but the signal sent from the HDMI cable conflicted with the TV display. This led to off colors and cloudy videos. It stilled displayed in HD but it all felt like it was at a lower quality than my old broken down TV.After playing with the settings for weeks, I finally figured out that you need a VGA or DVI cable to connect. The second I did that, it was night and day. The display couldn't be better.This isn't saying that the HDMI ports are useless. They work just fine with my PS3 playing blu-ray movies crystal clear.All in all, I really couldn't have asked for a better TV for the price.My only complaint is the PC settings. But that was more of a shortcoming on my side than the manufacturer.Though I'm going to hold off on the last star until I get a chance to really play with it in the new settings.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "great TV for the price.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1VCXX3LN9X6HW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a great TVNice picture, good soundGreat price.I will buy one again when I need it.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy with this so far!", "Author": "kidglov3s", "ReviewID": "R1AAIR082VL26C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace an ancient 1080i Olevia 32\", and so far I'm very happy with it.

Hart", "ReviewID": "RK9X4AYQJJJFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have been using a 46\" \"smart\" Sony LED TV we purchased from Amazon for the past two years.  We wanted to get a larger TV.  We considered a \"dumb\" 55\" and a \"smart\" 60\" for $150 and $250 more than we paid for this 58\" model.  We decided that all we really cared about the the picture quality and a VGA input (we still have computers lacking HDMI outputs).  We already have a Sony \"smart\" BD player for Netflix etc.We set the TCL up next to the Sony to evaluated picture quality.  I used a WOW BD calibration disc from Disney (also purchased through Amazon) to fine tune each display.Sharpness:At first I was concerned because I could see a lot of \"noise\" (heavy speckling on both sides of the yard lines) on the TCL vs the Sony watching a football game from an OTA source.  What I discovered is that the TCL \"sharpness\" processing is not nearly as good as the Sony \"sharpness\" processing.  When I set \"sharpness\" to zero on both sets they looked the same.  So if you like to use the \"sharpness\" effect I would not recommend the TCL set.  Of course \"sharpness\" is a artificial effect that is not needed with good source material.  It looks good on the Sony when used.  Not so on the TCL.BlueRay:The Sony and TCL set both looked very good with Blue-Ray source material.  I would judge the TCL as capable of a brighter display, important if you do a lot of watching during the daytime in a room without strong light control.OTA Source:We use a DVR to time shift (and commercial skip) almost all of our OTA viewing.  Our DVR converts the recorded 1080I/720P programs to 1080P so the TV does not have to deal with 720P/1080I. OTA programs look very good with our setup. I read a TCL TV review that was not impressed with the de-interlacing abilities.  This poor performance may be related to the poor performance of the sharpness control mentioned above.More Testing:I plan to do more testing and I will provide updates.Amazon:I have nothing but good results from the Amazon purchase of two TVs so far.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the money", "Author": "Azher Ahmed", "ReviewID": "R25ACWDOU6WY9K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Plugged it in...programmed to my DirecTV universal remote and enjoyed the show.Picture quality is pretty good (black levels, color, etc.) but I'm not videophile.

I'd never heard of TCL before and was leery. In fact, I almost purchased a Samsung model that was about $200 more.  In retrospect, I should have.  This TCL product has been completely frustrating and, in my opinion, it is a piece of junk.  First, the light bleed is terrible on dark scenes and nearly washes them out.  I can't seem to get the picture tweaked to reduce it.  It makes watching movies with alot of dark moments nearly impossible.  Now I'm having problems with the TV randomly shutting off, usually about 10 minutes after turning it on.  Once it clicks off it takes 30 minutes or so unplugged before it will turn back on.  I've sent service requests to TCL twice in the last week, no response.  I'm resigned to just take it back to Sams Club and pay the difference for a better TV.

Pretty lame. In terms of people complaining its not 120hz, it's honestly hard for me to say. Most 120hz+ tv's have software enhancements that give it the 'soap opera' effect and thus make it seem incredibly smooth, however this is not due to a 120hz+ panel. This TV does not seem to ghost at all, so while the panel itself could be 120hz all the time, there really is no way to verify it. I am coming from a 2008 Samsung LCD-TV and this TV does do the action/movement shots like sports a lot better.Pros - 500 bucks / extremely light / thin bezel / very good contrast / no ghosting so farCons - Dead pixel / backlight bleed / colors are very hard to adjust (especially for skin tones) / lack of control over specific settingsFinal verdict - I would totally save up a few hundred more bucks and go back with a name brand TV. While you may save with a brand like TCL you lose out in a lot of features.

Depending on the program I'm watching I will see horizontal ribbons or bars going across the TV.  Also, depending on what I'm watching, 2-3 particular pixels will go white so I see a blank dot in the middle of what I'm watching for the duration of the show.  And finally, depending on the show, some scenes will be crystal clear while others will look terrible... like you're watching it on a fuzzy antenna TV from the 90s.Something also worth mentioning is I have yet to see a program run at 120hz as advertised.  They all operate at 60hz, which is extremely disappointing on such a large TV.It's hard to pinpoint why I'm having these issues.  At first I thought I was just nuts but then as time went on I really felt like I got ripped off.  I called Amazon a little after the 30 day return window (I have only been using it for 2 weeks due to my busy travel schedule) and they stonewalled me.  They offered to take it back as an exception, but I would only get back $235 of the $600 I paid.I called TCL to see what they could do for me and they insisted it was the programs I'm watching and not the TV.  I know this isn't the case because I moved another TV next to this one and watched the same programs... no dead pixels, no ribbons, no fuzz.  So, either this TV is defective (which TCL swears it isn't) or the quality of this model is subpar and will always operate this way.We don't have cable so everything we watch is via Netflix, Hulu, etc., and our internet connection is GREAT with a hardwired connection to a PS3, not wireless.  Our internet speed is 60MB/S and the PS3 we're using gets 35 MB/S via the speed test.  The programs are HD, our internet connection is outstanding, yet the picture quality lacks... tough to say it is on my end and not the TV.Sad part is I want to return it and Amazon won't do anything to help me.  I'm pretty disappointed with this purchase, even at the $600 I paid for it.

Templar \"rexGun\"", "ReviewID": "R2297YQCHCL796", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little nervous about trying a TCL.  I know that Westinghouse helped the Chinese develop and build their HDTV production model and facilities.  To prove it out, Westinghouse has long been a provider of Very Good HDTVs that are excellent values.I have stood in stores with, so called, experts and done a set to set comparison with all of the top brands and Westinghouse only to have the whole group recognize that, when comparing apples to apples,the Westinghouse set actually looks more like real life than the Super TVs.To that end, I have owned three Westinghouse HDTVs over the years, 32, 42, 46.  None has ever died or degraded in quality.  I just keep giving them away, eventually, to my kids, to justify the next size up for our house.The next size up this time is this lovely TCL.  TCL televisions are made in the same factories as the Westinghouse sets.  Some even consider TCL to be an alternate brand name for Westinghouse in the HDTV market.  I had high hopes.I am very  pleased to report that this TCL HDTV is very nice.  It looks great, with a very thin bezel and clean look overall.  It's not super thin, but that is because it uses a full LED back panel instead of just side mounted lights firing across the whole LCD screen.  The upside to this is that if a \"pixel\" ever burns out, on this set you loose a dot on the screen while on a side lit set you loose a line all the way across the screen.  I prefer this technology.  They are a bit thicker, but they are also lighter.The picture on this HDTV is, once set up to my liking, very good.  It's not quite as good as a true Westinghouse, but most people would not see the differences. Good color, good clarity... James Bond's whiskers look very sharp and clear, as do his eyebrows, I'm too polite to look for nose hairs.  Overall the image is quite good, this set handles water, rain, fire, dust and smoke quite well.  Those are the tough ones.The speakers on this HDTV are much better than you usually get on a \"bargain\" model.  They are not as good as my Boston Acoustic Home Theater System, but nothing else is either.Overall, I can recommend this HDTV.  It is a good buy and a great value.  I will say this, if Westinghouse makes the exact set that you want then buy the Westinghouse over the TCL.  If TCL makes the set you are looking for then don't worry about it and go ahead and buy the TCL.  All things being equal I still prefer Westinghouse over TCL, but sometimes all things are not equal and you want a specific technology, like this one.  When that happens TCL is quite good for the money.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not the Product", "Author": "Robert Jeffs", "ReviewID": "R3OFSRN3CVZ1FM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The T.V.  they sent me wasn't the same as the picture on Amazon.

Detail is nonexistent especially in faces and blades of grass, and while black levels ARE impressive, the gamma curve is fixed so that bright colors in every image wash out all clarity.  However, worst of all is the weird hue of too much red and too much yellow which are unable to be fixed with the super-limited color settings on this unit.  Out of the box, the tint setting was disabled, and a firmware update is required to activate it, but even that couldn't get this TV to display a usable image.The only hope to get an image which doesn't hurt your eyes after 4 minutes is to turn down the sharpness, contrast, and saturation to almost nothing.  At that point you have a 58\" blurry weirdly-tinted image that reminds you of the big-old rear projection non-HD TVs they sold before DLPs became popular.Perhaps the smaller versions of this TV don't suffer as bad, but I can't stress to you enough my warning to stay away from the 58\".", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving this tv", "Author": "Patrick Keitt", "ReviewID": "R1BBT1CLHC14FU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So just got tv today I have to say the picture is awesome.

Since master bedroom TV might get watched only 1 or 2 hours a day, there was no need to buy more expensive set.

The picture quality is adequate for my needs; if you are a videophile, you will not like it. It has a hard time displaying black, and for some reason, no matter how much I try to tweak the picture (even using THX Optimizer), it just looks a bit too....fake?

It's not noticeable unless the program we're watching has a light / bright part of the show. I have a feeling the tv got pushed up against something and it harmed that part of the screen...it's too late for us to return it for another one but overall, that's my only complaint.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little Tv/PC Monitor", "Author": "Robot Brothers LLC", "ReviewID": "R220FU0DOWJB0G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After you fix the out of whack colors, it works very well for a pc monitor for gaming and media. the ports on the back are a little loose, but its also a 299 tv so that is acceptable.

The sound is surprisingly very good  and for general TV viewing does not need a sound bar. The sound is better than TV's twice its price. The picture however was very disappointing. I struggled for 4 days trying to get this TV is look good. I found that it was inconsistent. 720p cable TV looked washed out but 720p movies that I had ripped looked okay. Blacks were okay, but bright colors generally looked posterized and the \"blocks\" during up conversion were pretty obvious. Funnily enough the 120hz was great watching a BPL football game. My conclusion after fighting settings was that the TV would be great for sports games and watching my own movies (I can control frame rate etc), but for cable TV not so good.

Absolutely amazing is all I can say. We were replacing our boat anchor of a TV (old CRT) in our workout room with this one and by far the best choice we've ever made. Almost broke my back taking the old one off the wall. TV has outstanding picture, sound and the ease of setup was great as well. So far have not found any cons with the TV other than the fact that there is no audio output for like a stereo or anything but I have circumvented that by plugging into the headphone jack and tapping that into my stereo so I guess we're good.
