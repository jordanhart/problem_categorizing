{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A few thoughts", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "RFEG9VUMUI2C8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just had a couple of observations about both the tv itself, as well as the process of buying it. First, I want to mention that I ordered this tv on an evening where the price was 1368...or close to it. Sometime during the night, amazon lowered the price to 1299 and this was the price I ended up being charged. To my mind, that's just doing the right thing. Many companies would have just charged the higher price and waited to see if I caught it and called. So, credit to Amazon, well done.Delivery and packaging was excellent. The shipping company wanted to deliver several days after my expected delivery date. But, upon learning that this was the date given to me by amazon, they quickly amended the ship date. The tv arrived in perfect condition and the crew was pleasant.I really thought I was going to return this when I first powered it up. The picture was pretty bad and even though the settings are quite far off out of the box, it was more than that. But (and I'm not clear on why), after it hit the two hour mark or so, it really came to life. It focused, and most of the issues were corrected by this brief warm up period. It only happened the first time, and now it's ready to go as soon as you power it on.The tv itself is pretty solid as a budget led would go. Once dialed in, colors are good, picture overall is quite pleasing. This is a direct lit display coming in somewhere between edge lit and full array. as a result, it has good uniformity throughout and no light bleed on any edges. And, it does have a pretty thin bezel. The downside to the direct lit is the thickness. this tv is thick by todays standards.I just want to be clear, it's not a high end set. It doesn't have the black levels or motion handling of a plasma but, it does have the advantages of being an led lit LCD panel. You can play games, hook up your computer, forget to turn it off, or pretty much view whatever you want without fear of burn in or image retention. Do plasmas still have burn and ir in 2013? You bet they do, even with pixel orbiters and screen wash. But, it's a use case. I have a Mac mini and an Xbox on it, I needed the led. If it were movies only...it would have been a Panasonic plasma. All that said, for the money, it's a pretty darn good tv.A few small things worth mentioning. The remote is pretty particular about being pointed right at the lower left hand corner of the set to work. The set can be slow moving through menus. I have not tried the sound as its being fed from a pioneer receiver. Wireless worked great and connected to an apple AirPort Extreme without a hitch. I can't really speak to the apps. I have them on a roku 3, Apple TV 3, oppo 103 blue ray player, and of course the Xbox. So, really...how many times do you even bother setting it up. For what it's worth, the roku 3 is the way to go IMHO.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "I use this as a computer monitor", "Author": "Review", "ReviewID": "R20BN2KPMI0HMU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to use as a large computer monitor to use from my couch. Therefore, I have not connected it to the internet nor do I use any of the apps or \"smart TV\" features. To make one reviewer happy, I'm reviewing the 65\" version.I just received this and finished setting it up. A few helpful notes:1. One reviewer states that the remote is very sensitive to being pointed at a certain corner. This was not my experience. I can point the remote at the ceiling, floor, left, right and it still works (both the number pad and qwerty keyboard on the bottom). My TV is on a stand and not in a closet, which maybe the cause of that reviewer's problem.2. I managed to attach the stand and lift it onto the table by myself but it was a struggle and would have been much easier with someone else.3. Pilot Freight, the company which delivered the TV was an hour early, arriving at noon when my scheduled delivery was 1-3 PM. Thankfully the TV arrived undamaged. I did not mind but it was unexpected.4. I was initially shocked at the terrible input lag. I don't game with this monitor but there was a solid 500 ms lag out of the box. It was frustrating even for basic web browsing/moving a cursor around. I turned on \"Game Mode\" which drastically reduced the lag. There is still some lag but it's acceptable for basic use. I'm not picky about input lag and I came from a monitor which is known to have some lag but this thing is significantly worse, and even I notice it. I wouldn't do any heavy computer gaming on it. I don't know about console gaming.5. The settings out of the box weren't too bad. I ended up going with this:Picture Mode: Any setting you want but keep in mind you can't change the backlight until you disable the light sensor setting in advanced picture options.Backlight: 40 (I sit relatively close so you may prefer higher, I'm writing this review 2 feet from it but I normally sit about 75-85 inches from it).Brightness: 51Contrast: 60Color: 60Tint: -2Sharpness: 6Color Temperature: CustomRed Gain: 48Green Gain: 48Blue Gain: 46Red Offset: 50Green Offset: 50Blue Offset: 50Under advanced picture I turned everything off since I rely on my computer for most of those settings.6. The speakers almost completely lack bass and are basically unsable unless you don't care at all about sound. Even my crappy 4.1 computer speakers with a little 6\" subwoofer from over a decade ago are miles ahead. Just don't buy this TV expecting it to replace any kind of dedicated speakers. This is par for the course for TVs so I don't really count it against this TV. I wanted to address this because some reviewers were complaining about the speakers and you really shouldn't expect much.7. Some people complain about the stand but unless you try to knock it over or your kids hit it, it wont fall over on its own even if you nudge it. The stand is fine.8. For the price and size, this TV is great.9 You can get Dobly Digital from the optical output by going into the advanced audio settings and changing \"Digital Audio Out\" from \"PCM\" to \"Dobly Digital\".10. The remote is nice and basic. It's sturdy, looks good, and takes two AAA batteries. I don't use the qwerty keyboard but I don't find myself in danger of pressing them while using the top side of the remote and even if I did, they don't do anything unless you're in the right menu.11. The finish on the screen is anti-reflective but I would call it semigloss. Mine sits next to two windows and I notice some diffused glare on the black screen but none if there is a picture or anything other than black.I gave this 4 stars because:1. I wanted to turn the sharpness off but for some reason 0 was completely blurry and 6 seemed the most natural. This is annoying as I just want it to output the pure signal from my video card.2. Input lag3. I would have loved a lower price without the \"smart\" features. \"Smart\" features seem to be unavoidable these days. My computer is \"smarter\" than this TV will ever be.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tv at a great price", "Author": "Anne \"Anne\"", "ReviewID": "R1GGWCN09HJE4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was debating this TV with the Panasonic TC-P65S60 65-Inch 1080p which is currently exactly the same price (~$1300).  In my case it came down to the bright room, and the annoying reflections I had with my previous plasma (55 inch Samsung).  This TV definitely has less glare, which is great for my environment.  if you room is dark, the Panasonic probably is as good or better.Everything works fine.  The shipping by Pilot was flawless, and they set up the TV and took away the box etc.  no problems. I took the advice of others and turned off all the video features, especially the  light sensor which makes the screen too dim.  When all is off, the colors are great.  I see no problems with the blacks, but I am no expert.  It is similar to my previous plasma though.The best app is YouTube, which is not available on Roku  3(very important to point out!).  O/w I agree that \"SMART\" TVs aren't really worth it.  A basic TV with a great picture beats that any day.I have tried most features, and they work fine.  Streaming is excellent (wired/wireless similar).  Set up is quite simple.  4 hdmi ports is very useful to maximally use features.  Agree the sound isn't the best, but that is the same for all TVs.  adequate for me.The remote is kind of cute with a keyboard on one side, and standard buttons on the other.  it can be useful for some of the onscreen menus.  I do find it is hard to turn on/off the TV.  you do have to point the remote a little more than others to get it to work.  However, not a deal breaker.  Wish the remote was backlit though.  a pain when it is dark.It is definitely a big tv, much larger than my prior.  But perfect for my location.

Our last big screen TV purchase was a mid-high level Sony - over $2200 and it lasted 4 years!  This Vizio is a smart TV (Sony was not) and a few inches bigger screen, and was nearly 1/3 the price of the Sony which lasted all of 4 years.  Why spend all the money on a Sony that isn't going to last?  The Sony remote batteries outlasted the TV!  I understand I'm comparing a 4 year old LCD Sony with a new LED Vizio, but the Vizio picture blows away the Sony.  I also understand prices have come down in 4 years, but I see no point paying for a more expensive TV when something like this Vizio does the job.  The sound on the Sony was better, but it had built in sound bar-type front speakers.Delivered was as promised - was a great way to buy a TV.  Had never bought one online before, and Amazon made it a smooth process.  If any TV stops working, etc., Best Buy or other stores don't do anything about it, you have to call for service so it's no different buying from Amazon.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing picture. Get what you pay for.", "Author": "Chad D. Hummel", "ReviewID": "R11R8KHBFFYYOW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bottom of consumer reports larger than 60\" category.  Also wrong sticker for the energy guide. It reads $9/yr in the amazon picture and $9 on the tv when you get it but its actually $43/yr.Disappointed in the picture quality. Maybe some setting changes could help. Its calbrated using WOW.  There is some noticeable fuzziness with any movement on screen. When there is not much movement its a decent picture. When focused on the main object or person its clear but the background is very grainy . I don't have those problems on my 5 yr old lcd samsung..  Comparing the two the Vizio is not very good. Perhaps if it was my first HDTV I may not notice these issues. Maybe the fact the Samsung is 52\" and this is 65\" plays a part in the pic quality. I think the 120hz isn't as good as the samsungs 120hz.Pros:  Price, decent but not perfect picture quality 8/10Cons:  Picture quality 8/10 (yes- also a con since I feel as if I'm downgrading)  Remote  has to be directed towards the tv more than most remotes to recognize button presses  The stand, doesn't seem sturdy as most , that being said it wont tip on its own  Sound quality is poor, but many use external speakers anyway  The smart tv part of this is awful - apps are very very slow to load.  40 sec to start netflix rather than 5 sec on Roku. I wouldnt pay extra for a SmartTv. Leave that to dedicated devices unless its a  high end higher priced tv that can process faster.  The TV takes about 20 seconds to boot up after the power button is pressed.  Lines , streaks, and fuzzyness around moving objects  Always a grainy background even with an almost perfect foreground image.  Glare- Its terrible. Which I can't figure out. The samsung has a glossy surface and has a lot less glare and reflections than this  tv which has only a semi glossy screen. The Samsung must use some kind of filter to reduce this effect.  The edge , even though narrow, is very glossy and not even , like its warped, so it has an awkward glare as wellTip: 1st thing, turn off the ambient light setting. Vastly improves out of the box picture. but unfortunately not enough.Note:  The free shipping takes 13 days. I thought that was long considering the facility it was sent from was 5 hours from my home. Once it reached the local facility they called and said it would be 4 days before they could deliver so I went to pick it up there (2 hours round trip) to cut 4 days off the delivery time. 1) I wanted it right away 2) I didn't want it setting in a cold warehouse for 4 days.I hope its not a hassle sending this tv back. I don't feel right spending over 1K and not being completely satisfiedEdit: 12/20/13  I see this 65\" vizio is the worst rated tv in the over 60 inch category by consumer reports.

Chernicoff", "ReviewID": "R10LHVG4PDY3X2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With some tweaking to the picture settings this TV delivers amazing image quality. The backlight is almost perfectly uniform. On a completely black frame in a dark room you can just make out some columns of slightly brighter areas, but that is when looking very hard. In practical use, even in dark scenes in movies, that very subtle difference is unnoticeable. I would call this as good as it gets in an LED backlit TV. The compromise to achieve this is the increased thickness compared to edge-lit LED TVs. In my opinion, the trade off in thickness is worth it. Color accuracy is very good with a tendency to over-saturate reds a little. Detail is great and I am referring to true detail...the out of the box sharpening was turned up way to high.I haven't tried the built-in streaming capabilities yet.I am extremely happy with my purchase.My only real criticism was the delivery process.

Amazon customer care could not have been more helpful. They apologized, and immediately put through another order. My first tv was delivered broken on a Tuesday, and the new one was delivered that same Friday, even though it was projected as Tuesday/Wednesday of the next week.I have not been able to tweak everything to my liking just yet, but so far i am thoroughly happy with the image quality. I play a lot of xbox and stream tons of content through hulu, amazon prime, and netflix, so I am happy with what I have seen so far.I was disappointed the remote doesn't come with the qwerty back, like some of the other televisions, since using the built in apps requires a lot of typing to search and input account names. Backlighting would also be nice. I searched for a Vizio iPhone app, but didn't find anything that didn't require a dongle for my iPhone.Is this the greatest tv on the market, no, but it is an amazing value and it has met all my expectations for a television of this size and price. Although I was very sad to have my first one arrive broken, Amazon has proven, with their amazing customer support, why I keep going back to them instead of the big box stores.Edit: May 2014. This Tv has been incredible for the price. I work from home 2-3 days/ week and constantly play xbox one, watch live streaming, or use the USB to play files and I could not be happier for the price I have paid. This is an amazing TV.

The other reviews for product are fairly spot on.I wanted to get a large set (55+) but did not want to sacrifice quality.  When browsing by price I noticed this TV based on its low price for such a large screen (coupled with a good number of HDMI in's, Smart TV capability, etc).  I was not interested in 3D so it sounded like a good match for me.  It is definitely a great value for the price.  The picture quality is great.  I would give it a 9/10.  Some of the picture settings do need adjustment.  I did read another persons review stating the tv took a very long time to turn on\u2026it probably takes about 10-15 seconds.  Its not a big deal at all, you get used to it.  Not even noticeable anymore for me.My only complaints:1. Stand does not swivel left/right (it is also a little flimsy but it does the job).2. There is something up with the WiFi on mine.  It will not connect to my router.  I assume whatever wireless security I'm using is not supported by the WiFI card in the TV.  Not a big deal for me because I use an Apple TV rather than the apps that are preloaded.3. I've noticed while watching hockey there is sometimes a bit of a lag with the puck.  Its not always noticeable, but I assume that is due to the TV being 120hz vs 240hz.Overall I definitely recommend this set for the money.

(E601 and E701)  I'm very much a name brand person.  Anyway, I bit the bullet and bought the model from this year, hoping they fixed the problems from last year....only time will tell with that.  My first impressions out of the box were not that great.  All of the colors seemed washed out compared to my LG.  I adjusted my settings to match my LG, knowing that settings do not work the same for all tvs, but I just wanted a starting point.  After about an hour watching different sources, I got the settings dialed in to my liking.  I must say that this tv has a great picture.  I've been watching it for about 4 days now, and I'm almost completely happy.  The blacks are a lot darker than my LG, but that may be due to it being direct lit instead of edge lit.  I only have 2 problems with this set.  One, is the start-up time.  Seeing as this is a smart tv, I'm assuming that apps slow it down a bit.  The second is the Smooth Motion and Real Cinema.  These options are supposed to make the picture less juddery, but I've found on some shows and movies that the picture is more juddery.  It's not enough to be bothersome and I probably wouldn't have noticed it, except that I was looking for problems because it was new.  Anyway, after disabling those features it was no longer a problem.  I only briefly played with the apps and they seemed to work well.  One other thing that I found was that I could not find a media server that worked with the Vizio's DLNA.  Every one that I tried said that the codecs were incompatible, and I tried 5 different servers.

Since outside temperature is much lower these days, so the delivery guy suggested me to wait a while in room temperature before turning it on. Ok.He also suggested me to keep the box in case that I need to return it. Ok.Turn it on:Before tried to turn it on, I connected the HDMI cables. By doing that, the TV turned on by itself. Not sure it is by design or a problem.The remote control is not responsive. I had a very hard time to cursor through the initialization. Turn out that remote control has problem.The display is very dark. I saw other reviewer talking about turning off light sensor. After did that, display became better.I had FIOS setup box. It was used earlier with an Sony 55 inch, 1080p setting. By connecting to this TV, the setup box setting was changed to 720p. Later, spent some time to figure out and changed it back to 1080p.Also, I could not change the FIOS setup box channel. I think the new TV's remote control kept on sending out bad signal and jammed the FIOS's setup box. Removed the batteries from new TV's remote, FIOS setup box became functional again.I headed out to buy a $10 replacement remote, worked.TV took 20 seconds to turn on. Changing input (from TV to DVD) took 15 seconds.Tuning the picture:After turning off the light sensor, with the \"standard\" display setting, it is still dark. Turned the setting to \"vivid\", the display's brightness became similar to my 6 years-old 55 inch Sony default display. That is what I am using now. Not sure if it is a defect.The sound:Sounds is good for a LED-LCD TV.The build and stand:It has thin trim which is good, but the TV itself is bulky. The TV wobbles a bit if I push it on the side or connect cable. But it is fine standing by itself.Smart TV:With the bad remote, didn't use it much. I tried Netflix, took forever to bring it up.Overall:I didn't feel it is a good TV at all. It seems to be a stretched TV in size from my 6 years old 55 inch TV, and darker, not so vivid display. Also not very responsive to input, even with a \"good\" remote.Will I return it, NO.Will I recommend it to friends, NO.Am I happy with it, NO.Worth $1200 in price?

They rescheduled for the following day, same time.I received the TV within the shipping window. No obvious damage to the box, some light scratches. The screen was cracked/shattered completely across the top. There was also a strangle bubble at the top about the size and shape of an ostrich egg.Didn't even try to mess with it, called Amazon and they offered to either pick it up and refund or come to my house and trade another out. I'll update when the next one comes in.On another note, this is my first and only negative feedback on Amazon. This is also the most expensive purchase I've made through them. Not sure if there is a connection there, but I didn't have a problem with buying a TV online until now.Happy shopping!", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.99", "Features": "VIZIO Internet Apps - TV, Movies, Music, Apps\nRazor LED for richer colors and more vivid details in an ultra thin design\nBuilt-In Wi-Fi for easy internet access\n120Hz Refresh Rate with Smooth Motion for stunning detail and clarity in every image\n1080p Full HD for a crystal-clear picture", "Name": "VIZIO E551i-A2 55.0-Inch 1080p 120Hz Smart LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515kxwr6PcL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BF9MZ7Q"}}
