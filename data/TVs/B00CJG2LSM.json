I finally got around to contacting the company, only to find out that the tv had been recalled.I contacted customer service three times over a two month time period and my television, a recalled Model #ELDFT406, was still not fixed.The first time I called, the customer service representative (CSR) told me that I would be mailed the parts within days and a technician will contact me with two weeks. Neither of those things happened.The second time I called, the CSR told me that my parts were originally on back order, and that the first CSR was wrong to tell me that my parts were being mailed out when we spoke. He assured me that the parts were now in and that they would be shipped out immediately and I should receive them within days and a technician will contact me with two weeks. Neither of those things happened.I finally called for the third time. The CSR told me that the parts were still on back order and she would send an inquiry to the manufacturer who makes the parts and when they come in someone will call me. I told her about my conversation with the second CSR and how the parts were already supposed to be shipped. She said that information was incorrect.I obviously got the run around from these people. The television had been recalled and I had been in contact with them for 2 months already. I finally did receive the parts in the mail about 3 weeks after the 3rd call and after filing a complaint with the BBB.  The technician came to my house and changed them.  And guess what?  Yeah, it still doesn't work.And now they want me to pay to ship them my broken tv so they can send me a refurbished one.  I'm sorry, but I bought a NEW tv...if they are going to replace it, it should be new.  And I shouldn't have to pick up the dime when the tv has been recalled!$300 for a tv that collects dust.Go to Element Electronics facebook page...it's all there to see...all the people that have tried to get their tv's fixed.  Check out this company's BBB rating.  They make an inferior quality products and then don't stand by to fix products that, admittedly, don't work.  Don't waste your time or money.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!If I could, I would give them ZERO stars...but Amazon won't allow it.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Element 40\"", "Author": "Clint", "ReviewID": "REIFW7NDZMU8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv at Wally World for $287. It had mixed reviews on line so I bought the 3 year warranty for about $20. Been working great for about a year. Sound is pretty crappy but its hooked to my surround system. Only con with that is the tv volume doesn't control the output so I leave the tv on 0 and control the surround separately. I'd recommend buying it from a place you can add the warranty andakes it well worth the risk. At the time it was half price of anything comparable in the store. Def worth $300!", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Element Reviews on Facebook", "Author": "Pete Rager", "ReviewID": "RTP1JMYFFIOKK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "WARNING : Before any of you even think about buying Element Electronics TVs go to their FB page and look at the mounting customer complaints!!!!!", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Buy for Under $300.00!", "Author": "Gary Allen", "ReviewID": "R8CK0CW61N8A1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased this item at Target for $269.95 with HDMI cables and two year extended warranty for a grand total of $343 and change.The picture is excellent and like all new sets today the sound is awful.Will upgrade the audio but other then that we are pleased with this purchase.A 40 inch TV for under $300.00 this has to be one of the best buys out there.Only three stars due to the weak audio.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "the tv is ok", "Author": "George Brow", "ReviewID": "R3TC9CA7TPFKXM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "average TV do not put the tv in power save mode/home mode when selecting set up wizard. it will mess it up who would want to watch tv for 30 minutes and have it shut off. read the manual . Go to menu then the display mode and change it to standard . or when first operating choose standard tv mode also the tv comes in wide screen choose cinema on menu . This is the reason why thiers a so called recall just on the operating sytstem element made to save power they need to get rid off it so people dont bother with the option.

It is not worth the risk of maaaybe getting a good TV, when element out right admits that the TV's are defective.
