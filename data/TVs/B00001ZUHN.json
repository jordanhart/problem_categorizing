This Television is a beauty...make no mistake!!  The picture is clear, crisp and concise.  Set up was not as I read in previous reviews as being easy, it was anything but easy.  But then we(my husband and I) are not techo buffs.  My son has since played with it and is finally set up perfectly.  we love it and that says alot because i am definately not a couch potatoe...but not I cant wait to get home to veg out on the couch with my remote in hand....Incidently we also purchased the sony 5 disc progressive scanner dvd/cd player and love it too", "Date": "January 31, 2003"}, {"Title": "It's about time but what were they thinking on that price?", "Author": "C.

But with a huge price tag more then double their competitors of the same size hdtv set who are they kidding.  And of course this model is not available anywhere.  You can not even find it on sony's web site.  So amazon knows about it but that just means they plan to sell it in the us.  Who knows when, and at $...I don't see them selling to many.  Don't get me wrong I love sony products everything I own is sony, if this product was priced comparably with it's competition I'd be at the store right now picking it up.  Looks like the competition is still got the upper hand on HDTV.  I hope sony corrects this soon as it's almost football season.", "Date": "June 5, 2001"}, {"Title": "The best TV Ever", "Author": "\"donsaxena\"", "ReviewID": "RUQ8ZSXNMZCL4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is excellent.  I watch HDTV movie channels through Dish Network and the picture is incredible. Compared to the huge projection TV's this TV's picture is unbeatable. It compacts 1080 lines into a space of 34 inches as opposed to 64 or another big screen size.  This tv makes going to the movies obsolete.", "Date": "September 29, 2001"}, {"Title": "It's about time but what were they thinking on that price?", "Author": "C.
