The PN597000 is a slight step-down from Samsung's flagship 8000 model, but it's also plagued with the same issues, most notably a \"peeling\" issue.Samsung devised a solution to eliminate most of the glare from the 7000/8000 series sets, calling it the Real Black Filter. The RBF is a sheet of thin plastic laminated on the inside of the front set glass to mitigate glare caused by direct incoming light for those rooms with a lot of ambient light present. Kind of like a tint for a car window. Is it effective? Yes.Does it at a huge price? Absolutely.You see, what Samsung failed to predict and discover - and, more disturbingly, what they refuse to acknowledge even at this stage - is that this plastic sheet can PEEL on its own from the inside, possibly due to the considerable heat generated from the plasma set, creating air bubbles within the screen itself that will only EXPAND during the course of time, distorting or otherwise ruining the television.I've learned about the peeling issue before getting the television set, since it seemed not everyone was having this issue (although a great number were). I thoroughly inspected my television around the edge using a flashlight and found no signs of peeling. It wasn't until after 100 hours of breaking in the plasma did I notice a slight distortion on the top right corner of my set, and it was as I feared: my set was peeling.I'm still one week into the purchase of this television, and I will undoubtedly return it toward the tail end of my 30-day exchange window as my television's newfound problem will only accelerate over the course of time. Every report I've heard from other owners with this issue seem to indicate that matters will only get worse from here.I urge both current and potential buyers to research this matter before it's too late. I will exchange my set for a newer model, but I have very little hope that the new machine will not suffer from the same issue as my current one as the problem is inherit in the design of the set and not a mere random defection.UPDATE: 07/09/2011 - A second peeling (air bubble) has appeared, this time on the top left corner of the screen.UPDATE 2: 07/27/2011 - Just received my replacement TV from Amazon (Love you, Amazon!), and am currently in the process of breaking it in. By this time, Samsung has discovered the underlying cause of the peeling issue. Apparently, the television's bezel is pressed too closely against the black filter, and needs to be separated slightly more. A solution has been devised and, from my understanding, Samsung will fix or replace any TV suffering from peeling issues with an updated panel provided that it's still under warranty. Unfortunately, they won't replace existing stock of their TVs with revised models, so new customers might still face this issueUPDATE 3 (11/24/11): Second TV has not shown any initial signs of peeling or bubbling. I attribute this more to luck than anything else as the TV was built around the same time as the original defective one, and Samsung didn't address the issue at the point of the purchase. I've read that, in some cases, signs of peeling might won't surface until months later, and some owners are SOL as a result since the peeling occurred after the expiration of the warranty. I'll post another update in 3 months (or sooner if any unfortunate developments occur). If it can last a year without any problems, I'll upgrade my rating.Update 4 (6/3/13): I've now owned the replaced set for two years and no problems whatsoever, so as promised i have upgraded my rating to 5 stars after originally giving it 1 due to the screen bubbles. This will be my final update of this product.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Plasma", "Author": "Daveao \"Dave1000\"", "ReviewID": "R2IQKWTPRL1RUR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got the TV and have had it 2 days.  My other TV's are a 42in Samsung LCD and a 50in sony rear proj. LCD.I read about plasma vs. LED and went for the plasma.  It is in the livingroom which has full height glass windows on one side.  We get direct morning sun as windows face S/E.I bought the set over internet shipped free.  Need 2 people to move very large box into home.  Need 2 people to hang the set. I unboxed and mounted hanger by myself.If considering plasma, here are my comments:1. 3D is excellent.  Get the largest set you can afford/ fit in home.2. Picture on this set is very very good.  Very vivid, yet realistic color and contrast.3. Remote is good, but not a high end look.  Possibly because many use other combo remotes.4. Glare is not an issue.  The sony used to be in livingroom and glare was more of an issue.5. Off axis viewing is outstanding.  2D excellent.  3D excellent from any angle.6. I bought the light rechargeable 3D glasses.  Easy setup.  Comfortable.  OK over your perscrip. glasses, but not great.7. TV looks great. Thin, high quality.8. I mounted this set on new Walker Edison 60-Inch Cayenne TV Stand (black laquer and black glass).  They are made for each other!!  Looks great and size of stand fits perfect (width) with TV.  TV \"floats\" above table- mounted on the stand's rear pedestal.9. Network/ wifi works good.  Allshare works but sometimes buggy, as playing videos can abruptly stop (sometimes).  I am still figuring the wifi and remote out.  Plaing music through the wifi or network to livingroom is so cool.10.  I do not hear buzzing unless audio is off and my ear is very close.  And I only heard once when setting up system. Buzzing to me is not an issue.  I don't hear/ notice buzzing.11. Fast motion picture is excellent.  No artifacts, no ghosting that I have noticed.  2D and 3D.Update - 6/26/11.  Still love this set.  No screen peeling issue.Update - 10.6.11.  No screen peeling.  Love the set.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV (updated)", "Author": "T. Black", "ReviewID": "R2G5MKU1SD9G5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background:I come from the land of LCD, and I have had this TV for about a month.  This replaced a several year old Sharp Aquos 37\" LCD.  As is typical with electronics, this 51\" brand new 2011 plasma costs significantly less than my 37\" 2 year old (at the time) refurbished model.I have limited space, and my choices to fill it included the LG 47\" LED TV's, Samsung 46\"LED TV's, and the Samsung 51\" Plasmas.  (Just for the record, an LED TV is just an LCD with LED lights behind it instead of flourescent bulbs.  I use the term LED TV only because it's easier to type and read than LED-backlit LCD TV.)  While I would have preferred an LED TV for my situation (which is a very bright room), The LG's were not impressive.  Though the Samsung LED's were (to my eyes) the best looking TV's on display at my local BB, 51\" is a lot larger than 46 and the seating is about 17' away from the TV.  The new 2011 \"Plus 1\" models add an inch of screen, but are actually smaller overall.  In other words, last year's 50\" would not fit but the 51\" would (barely!).  Panasonic 50\" would not fit either due to a larger bezel.Buying on Amazon:If you are a Prime member, keep in mind that this will not reach your house in 2 days.  It will ship by freight, not UPS or Fedex.  Mine arrived in less than a week on a mostly empty truck and the driver helped me bring it into my house.  It was obviously well packaged and arrived in perfect condition.  Well of course the price immediately went down after I bought it, so I took advantage of the price matching policy.  Amazon has a list of retailers that it will match and you have 14 days to do it.  Once again Amazon impresses in their customer service.  Many other retailers do include other goodies like glasses or a Blu-ray player as a bundle though.Setup:After you turn it on, you go through a step-by-step setup process.  The first question is whether you are a consumer or a big box store.  It then adjusts the picture settings for home viewing as opposed to trying to look like the brightest one in the store.  Nice!  I went through the network setup (wireless works fine), and it learned my channels with no problem.  It actually picked up many digital (cable) channels that I wasn't getting before through the old TV, so that is great.  Haven't tried OTA channels at this point.-Screen burn in/break in: Since I am new to plasma, I am a bit paranoid about screen burn in and image retention (IR).  During the initial setup, ghost images of some of the menu screens remained for a few minutes.  I burned a break-in DVD that cycles through full-screen solid color for 24 hours and ran it whenever I wasn't watching TV for the first 3-4 days.  I won't make any comments on burn in yet, but I have played some Xbox/Wii and haven't had any issues yet.  There is a feature in one of the menus that will display scrolling vertical bars that transition from white to black.  No evidence yet of any permanent burn in or IR yet.-Heat:  Plasmas have come a long way since I was shopping for my old LCD.  Used to be they would dim the lights and heat the whole house when you turned them on, but new models are much more efficient.  This one gets pretty warm in the cabinet but not hot enough to be a concern.The Good:-The sound from the internal speakers is actually quite good, surprisingly.  I wouldn't want to do any serious movie watching without 5.1 surround, but for TV shows it is adequate.-The picture:  Brightness is much better than my old LCD, but significantly less than today's LED TV's.  That being said, I have a wall of south facing windows behind the couch which is opposite the TV.  The picture is bright enough during the day to watch, but still looks much better at night when the room lighting is dimmed.-Picture settings:  I put in my old Avia HT setup dvd and went to the picture settings.  The TV seemed to match pretty well right out of the box.  There are boatloads of picture options though, more than enough to baffle the average user (myself included).  This thing is ready to be professionally calibrated, if that's your thing.-I hear lots of complaints about TV's not displaying standard definition material well.  Okay, you have to understand what you're watching.  If you crank up your old VCR, it is still going to look like an old VHS tape.  This TV does an excellent job of upscaling poor quality content on the large screen.-I have done some gaming, and have not noticed any lag.-3D.  I have done some research but have not tried out any 3D content yet.  The glasses have gone as low as thirty-six dollars lately!  The glasses for 2011 samsungs are bluetooth instead of IR.  The TV has 2D>3D conversion capability with a dedicated button on the remote.  I've got 2 pairs of glasses on order, and will update after I get to check out the 3D features.-Lots of online content.  Checked out the YouTube app last night,  pretty slick.  It's not the equivalent of having a full browser interface, but I was able to find what I want and watch several relevant clips.  Hulu demo clips looked excellent, but frequently buffered on my wireless connection.-Cable channels display quickly, and you can quickly switch through channels without waiting for them to display.  You can delete channels you don't want, though they make this a bit of a tedious process.  You can mark favorites, so a star will show up up by the channel number when you are surfing.  One thing I haven't figured out is how to quickly surf just your favorites--but you can get to them deep in the channel menu.The Bad:  (mostly minor gripes except the first 3)-There are no analog audio outputs from this TV!  Unless I'm missing something, you can't pipe analog sound from this TV to your receiver.  It does have an optical port for outputting digital sound, but I never found a channel that I could listen to on the home theater.  If someone knows otherwise, please let me know with a comment--Thanks!-The glossy finish:  The glass front does reflect a good bit of light from the windows behind the couch.  I got the 7000 model for the \"Real Black Filter\" (listed above as \"Rel black filter\"), which is a polarized screen filter.  I would definitely prefer the matte finish of my old Sharp Aquos, but nearly every current model has a glossy finish.-The front panel buttons:  The power, source, menu, channel and volume buttons are printed in grey-black ink on a glass background, and are touch sensitive.  If it is dark behind your TV then good luck seeing which is which, even within a few inches of them.  I use the power button, since it is the furthest to the left and I can slide my finger along the bottom until I get it, but the other buttons are useless since you can't distinguish them from the rest of the glass panel.  Also, when I'm working on anything behind the TV my arm always hits the very sensitive power button repeatedly and causes additional frustration.  At least the remote is decent, but my fancy learning remote refused to learn several of the commands.-Hulu \"plus\" - Just for the record, this is hulu, \"plus\" a bill for $8/month (but you do get access to older episodes).  I'll stick to plugging in my laptop and watching it for free, thanks.-To search in youtube, you type in text using the 1-9 keys like a phone.  This would be easier if they found a way to put the letters onto the remote's 1-9 keys.  It is displayed on the screen but not on the remote.  This is a minor gripe though, since it does a good job of figuring out what you are typing and giving suggestions.-Volume is a bit slow to change.  If you switch from a quiet channel (or youtube video) with the volume on 50 to a loud one, it can take several seconds to get the volume down to a 20-25 using the remote.  Volume levels vary widely on youtube, not so bad on cable.The bottom line:If you go to a big box store to compare, the Samsung TV's definitely stand out amongst the competition, the LED's in particular.  I am very happy with my plasma, but if I had unlimited space I would have loved a 55\" LED.  If you have a very bright room, go for either a LED TV or the 7000 series Plasma with the real black filter.I will have to do a bit more playing around to learn all of the features and perfect my picture settings, and I will update the review as I learn more.  Please feel free to comment if you want me to check something...I'll try to help if I can.**UPDATE**Still nothing but pleased with this TV, but after changing the viewing mode to Dynamic (*not* energy star), the TV gets quite warm with extended use.  I am getting a small USB fan to help cool it, and considering switching back to standard mode to reduce energy use/heat.  The good thing is that the metallic bezel seems to absorb much of the heat.  This helps disperse some of the heat out of the front in addition to venting the back.**UPDATE**I found a happy medium between Dynamic (energy hog) and Standard (energy star) picture modes and applied it to all of my inputs.  Basically, I start with Dynamic but reduce the cell light down to 16 and neutralize the color temperature.  The energy star setting is much dimmer (12?), the dynamic setting is 20 (the max).  16 is still plenty bright but the panel doesn't get quite as hot.  I would also mention that movie mode results in a very soft (less defined) and warm (more red) image.  It enhances skin color I guess, but I prefer a more natural color and definitely like to see all of the detail in HD sources.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "UPDATE 25-05-2012: 3 Dead Pixels....Goodbye Samsung", "Author": "SuPeRz", "ReviewID": "RUWPM2EDL7N1T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for about a week now. I am a techie (computer engineer/analyst/programmer...geek) so I thoroughly researched this TV and reviews like this before making this purchase (my first plasma, and step into HD and step into 3D, lol).CNET rated the D8000 as the second (close second to the Panasonic) best 2011 TV overall. With a little bit of research,I found that the D7000 is actually the same panel as D8000. It lacks the internet browser, skype, local contrast enhancer (???) and qwerty remote. None of these (to me) justifies paying more. So I would say that the D7000 is just as good more or less, and since I wanted to get the very latest and greatest, why  not? It's cheaper!Other reviews already did a good job at covering the features, so I'll round up my findings quickly and skew my review to cater for the gamers, PS3 in particular like myself.Picture quality from SD sources: 7/10...the TV is just too big to stretch those images without blurring etcPicture from HD sources: 10/10Original Blu Ray 3D content (native): 10/10...not just a fad...it is brilliant!3D content downloaded (Side by Side): 10/10...it plays just as well surprisingly, watched Avatar this way and it was IMAX..without the sound of course!2D to 3D conversion: 8/10...it's just not as good as 'made for 3D' stuff but the feature will be utilized!Internet options: 9/10...download the Viaway app, it has enless content, no cable or antennae? no problem! A browser would have made it a 10Buzzing: what buzz???...I put my ear on the back of the thing and well, you knew it was on, lol...nothing to report here!Image Retention/Burn-in: 8/10...nothing bad, it goes away quickly and you have to be looking for it to notice it. Use any of the Burn-in Prevention options provided.Build: 10/10, slim, solid build, gorgeous!PS3 Owners:I upgraded to a HDTV and made sure it was 3D for one game...Uncharted 3Gaming on this size screen is not what I would consider ideal, I would pretty much say that a 40\" should suffice. Most games are 720 and therefore it's a hugh stretch for this screen so sharpness is definitely not a strong point. 1080p games show alot better and upscalling using the PS3 would make it look a little crisper, except now the there are more jaggies and screen tearing. (no fault of the TV and is generally not recommended). There is no lag with the 600Hz subfield drive, fast action is brilliant, colours are brilliant and you will enjoy playing on this TV. But if you are really into crisp graphics I would say hook your PC up with the latest video card and be blown away OR try the LED series(costs alot more though), I believe the crispness will be there but it may be unrealistically so...it is a game however, so unreal may be what you're going for.3D Gaming is good from native 3D games, it does change the experience a bit so it's worth a try, but until Uncharted 3, I will reserve comment on whether it is 'the next level' of gaming. Played Black Ops in 3D, and it was surprisingly good. Again 2D to 3D conversion with games is nice, FIFA did make me feel like I can reach out and touch players when they were close to the sideline.Overall:I could not have asked for a better budget entry into HD and 3D. This TV has it all, built in Wi-Fi, apps, 2D-3D, Picture in Picture...the works! and all at a low price! I got the bundle deal with the free Blu-Ray player and Starter Kit. All 5 movie disks were in it, no need to redeem any coupons! I am selling the player as I have a PS3 and all the additional features are available directly from the TV...easy money back!UPDATE 14-09-11After less than 30 days, came home one night, turned on my TV and started watching a Blu-Ray movie streaming off my PC when I noticed a single pixel thick line going vertically from the top to the bottom of the TV. (Noooooo!...I almost cried!) Apparently dead or stuck pixels...common problem among Plasmas and LCDs. Now it's back at the Retailer being \"repaired\" under warranty. No word as to whether a repair is possible or if they will get me a brand new set...impatiently waiting....sigh!UPDATE 13-12-11Finally got my TV back, the line is gone, they changed the entire panel, BUT NOW I HAVE A SINGLE DEAD PIXEL. I know that will qualify as a good set through quality control so I can live with it, just wish it wasnt so close to the center. Anyways, I have Uncharted 3 and Batman Arkham City so I will check them out and complete my 3D review for the gamers once I'm finished. This experience has been very very bad, so I cannot rate this TV any higher, as it still came back with a defect (dead pixel) after months of repairs. Only time will tell how well it works, I pray that it doesn't give any more trouble for a few years at least.UPDATE 02-03-12OK, this update is only for the gamers looking for 3D review. After completing Uncharted 3, playing Batman: Arkham City, Killzone 3 and other 3D game content I must say that 3D gaming is still in its infancy. While Killzone did have a few standout moments and the snowy environment helped to immerse you in the world as snowflakes seem to fall all around you, generally, 3D gaming lowers the resolution so low that all you see is a Lo-Def version of the game and not enough 3D-ness to warrant it.UPDATE 25-05-12Now the set has 3 Dead pixels. This TV which was once beautiful and considered the best TV I've purchased has turned out to be the worst investment of my life. I wish it worked properly...but 9 months later, it doesn't look like it will make a year!

POLLARD", "ReviewID": "R1FDZSIR97ITZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the D7000 a week ago and thus far I have been blown away.Aesthetic Appeal: I love the look of the TV. It is razor thin compared to plasma models in the past and the small, charcoal colored bezel gives it a classy look. I previously had a Samsung 50 inch plasma and I was quite surprised that the D7000 at 51\" is about 5 inches smaller (in width) than my previous TV (yet the screen size is actually bigger). They really have slimmed the bezel down in the last 3 years, which I think is pretty slick looking.Picture Quality: Superb. Awesome. Incredible. I cannot say it any clearer. Crisp, clean, vibrant images that leave my mouth dropping. Blu-ray is incredible. My daughter has some Tinkerbell movie on Blu-Ray and the picture quality is INCREDIBLE. I actually don't mind watching Tinkerbell anymore... I only have the TV on moderate brightness...I hear than giving the unit some \"break-in\" time is important. Still, the picture quality is great.DirectTV HD is also flawless. ESPNHD, FoxNews and even the Disney channel look amazing. 600 Hz for Sports is the way to go- none of this 240 Hz LED crap... Plasma is DEFINITELY the way to go for sports folks! 3D content is pretty sweet too (see update below).I did notice that the \"Eco\" setting does result in some random dimming of the image as previously stated by other reviews. I turned that fetcher off and everything is perfect.I actually went with the D7000 because of the \"Real Black Filter\" feature. I don't know if it makes a huge difference, but I do notice less glare than the previous model I had in a well lit room, and the blacks do look deeper and richer. Of course, this is a subjective thing...but I do consider myself a pretty tough critic.3D Quality: I watched Shrek in 3D right after hooking it up. I hate that damn movie, but it was pretty impressive in 3D. I have DirectTV and am still trying to figure out how to pipe the 3D channels to my TV...stay tuned. The 2D-to-3D feature is pretty cool too. It is not as good, dare I say, as Shrek on Blu-ray...but it is pretty cool and does a fair job.Sound: Quality is fine. It does seem to require a higher setting than my previous TV, which just means that you have more control over the intensity of sound.Features: There are 4 HDMI inputs in the rear of the TV. I have a blu-ray, DirectTV receiver and a computer hooked up to this puppy. The remote is the same remote that has come with the past few blu-ray models. Doesn't matter to me, as I use the DirectTV remote for everything. There are also a VGA input, Ethernet input, and component inputs. The SmartTV thing is interesting...still don't really care much about it. There are features to stream video content from your PC. The TV recognizes my PC, but I haven't had time to play with this.Overall, I'd give this thing 5 stars and would recommend to anyone. Amazon was great to deal with and it is by far the best price around. I got a 3D blu-ray, 3D starter kit and the TV for less than Best Buy was asking for just the TV.I'll keep this updated as time goes on...UPDATE #1: 3D and SportsAfter fiddling around, I figured out how the 3D works for DirectTV. DirectTV pipes it in in two feeds that can be viewed side-by-side when you turn to a 3D channel (e.g. ESPN 3D). On your samsung remote, push the 3D button and switch to overlay. It then takes the two feeds and overlays them, making it compatible with your Samsung TV 3D glasses.I have to say the 3D is pretty spectacular. I just watched the NBA finals in 3D and it was a blast. It does take some getting used to, and I bet would only be better as you have a bigger TV. It seriously looks like your looking out your window on center court. Very cool! I can't wait to see some college football with this thing!UPDATE #2: Buzzing sound & College FootballWe've had this puppy for five months or so and I haven't noticed any buzzing sound that last models reported. So FYI, looks like that problem is in the past. College football on ESPN is sweeeeeeet.

Back when I was shopping for an HD option, this was the best bargain to be found. I had to add an HDMI card and a splitter to make it work...but the quality was amazing.I was not particularly looking for a 3D television, but had been shopping these for quite some time when CDnet rated the Samsung its best of 2011.When I clicked through Amazons pricing, it sealed the deal. This was an incredible price for a t.v. of this quality. The comparable Panasonic I had been stalking was almost twice what I ended up paying for this one.First of all, the 4 HDMI inputs allowed me to eliminate a literal bag full of wiring to my home theater system. I simply eliminated the HDMI splitter, wired everything into the T.V. (Direct T.V. DVR, 3d blueray player, home computer etc...) and then ran the optical audio back to the the theater system...done.The HD picture quality on this set is incredible out of the box, and with some minor tweaking it is unbelievable....but the real story is the 3d.I had ordered a video called \"The Seven Wonders of the Solar System\" when I ordered the set, and it arrived the same day. By the time I had the system set up, it was dark, so I turned off all the lights, set up the glasses and put in the video.In the dark, the 3d quality creates the effect of a moving, 3 dimensional hologram floating in the room. That is the only way I can describe it...  absolutely stunning. As others have pointed out, the effect is reminiscent of the first time you saw HDTV....only more.The next day, I figured out how to make the Direct TV 3d channels work (picture settings, 3d, combined image). To my luck, ESPN 3d was re-running one of the college championship games from last year. Absolutely jaw dropping. This should be the best football season of my lifetime!....but the real surprise to me came when I tested out the 2d-3d up conversion.One of the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies was playing on TNT HD, so I switched to the 2d-3d format, expecting a less than mind blowing effect. When I changed the depth setting that becomes available with the up conversion, it actually worked! The New Zealand landscapes were just ...real looking! The color was as vivid and intense as being there.To those reading that have owned past versions of 3d sets, I apologize for the superlatives....but I truthfully did not know that the technology had advanced this far.To those waiting for the advancements to make it worthwhile to jump in...now is the time.

CNET named it best TV of 2011 (in terms of picture quality and value, as of august 2011).I wanted to comment on game performance on this set, since that info was somewhat fuzzy/lacking:Gaming is BEAUTIFUL on this set.  Perceivable lag is minimal-to-none for me, even in movie mode.  I had done tons of research to determine what the lag was on this set, and saw tests of 16-32 ms (1-2 frames on a 60FPS game).  I am an avid gamer and I perceive NO lag in movie mode.  I would feel comfortable saying that there should be no perceivable lag for 98% of gamers in 'game mode' on this set.  I was prepared to run the set in game mode for gaming, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that movie mode was plenty responsive for me.There are some issues with image retention.  These are not permanent.  I played a game with a static, non-transparent HUD for 90 minutes straight, and could *very slightly* see the HUD against the set's built in \"burn-in test pattern\" gradient when finished.  I can confidently say that I would probably not notice this if I was not specifically looking for it.  This retention decreased significantly after 30 minutes of a different game, and was gone in about 2 hours.  I don't anticipate having any problems with permanent image burn-in, but I am prepared to have some periodic retention issues down the line.  The set does have a 'cleanse' pattern, and I will probably do a '5 minute cleanse' when taking breaks about once an hour during longer gaming sessions.There are reports of the screen 'peeling' on the 7000 plasma series.  Here is what I found about that:a) If your set is susceptible, it will happen within 6-12 weeks of running the set.  Essentially, the heat of the display triggers the peeling.  You have a year of Samsung warranty on this set, and Samsung will send a repairman out to fix this issue during that time period.b) Samsung has identified and fixed the issue for new TVs (estimated manufacture date is the September 2011 timeframe)c) I've seen it mentioned that the 51\" model of the 7000 is not even susceptible to the peeling (however, I never saw this confirmed on multiple sources)I would say that a consumer should not let the screen peeling issue detract from purchasing this TV.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "the very best bang for the buck", "Author": "satisfied", "ReviewID": "R1L45LFAX7XN9U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm giving this five stars because of  the quality of  this Samsung  3d tv and  the integrity of  Amazon.  First it's a stretch to fork over $1500 on  television,  you  had not  actually saw  but I had done my homework. I read the reviews on Samsung, Panasonic, and others.  I knew I didn't want one that was too glossy, and  could fit my budget of 1500. Samsung's  C8000 was second only to panys  flagship yet it cost five or six l hundred dollars less than  Panasonic's. I didn't  need the best , but I did want very good.  Unlike most people I wanted 3d, and when cnet  noted  that Samsung  was reducing the cost to 49 dollars for a pair, it was a no brainer. Before I talk picture  quality  lets talk  amazon  I bought this tv  and price dropped by By  almost  200 by one of amazon's direct  competitors. Amazon matched that price I had interest free financing for 24 months and  Samsung had the glasses for 49 bucks.  Do the math, that's a savings of  about  200 dollars  on each  ((price, financing , and 2 pair of glasses),  add free shipping , and  Amazon's 30 day  return guarantee  why I'm also giving amazon 5 stars. Now  back to the television. First samung seem to have taken a step backwards  the way  digital cds  did in relation to analog.  I mean the picture is sharp,  and vivid but its a television  not window into how things  look on stage.  In color or black and white, the objects are smooth  and clear but not stark  no soap opera effect here on anything.  Does this tv have the deepest blacks  the  most vivid  colors, or sharpest picture of  any  tv? No; but  the blacks are deep, the colors are vivid and  the picture is  sharp.  And  3d  only compounds this. There's no moving  black dots  when you increased the brightness like they were saying about the pany in this price range. Yes the picture Does  jump out of screen  in 3d.  Hubble is great movie to take it throught its paces,  the stars and  galaxys Have a lot to say about  color and  deptness. Finally I have direct tv and there is 2 dedicated 24/7  free  3d channels and one pay per view(so much for content)  not including  espn 3d on major  sporting  events. Anyway Im giving Samsung 5 stars for a very good  tv with excellent 3d and value and amazon for Making it happen with  financing , an even better value and its integrity. I said finally however; I thought I had a problem with this tv (it constantly dim and brighten on any channel) I called amazon and they told me they would send me another one. I followed up on this by calling samsung so see if this was trend and told it was an eco sensor, but it was amazon that was standing behind their guarantee that truly amazed me.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stunning, both On and Off", "Author": "J.

I took that back and bought the much anticipated 55 inch Vt30 which had the best blacks out of the four and the colors were better than 55 inch gt30 but wanted something a little cheaper, and figure I would try the lg led and was a big mistake, maybe I had a bad unit but was horrible, then went back to the 50 gt30 for a 1200 price, because the samsung was not in stock at the time, when it became available I bought it for around 1250 for a 51 inch and figure it would save me about 1200 compared to the vt30 with just 4 inches smaller.I have to say the black are JUST about as deep as the vt30, the color is noticably better, very impressed with overall picture quality. I just wished I would have gotten the 59 inch version although that is a little large for my living room, my one complaint is if you don't hang it on a wall the stand is a little flemsy. The panasonic series has way better stablity as far as having it on a stand, doesn't move at all,(doesn't swivel though past 50 inches) But after having the three the samsung is the much better value for about half the price of the vt30, if the vt30 was cheaper it would be a tough choice, but I think I would still take the samsung because the overall picture quality is better, as far as the bright colors,even though the vt30 did have better deep blacks than the pnd7000(but not by much).The samsung does have a nicer design, but it did have a worse glare off of my living room windows than the vt30, but its not bad by any means. I like how the vt30 looked on my TV stand as you couldn't see the wires behind the TV, to where the samsung you can because it sits up due to the swivel function. The sound is pretty decent and the controller layout is easy to navigate, have not tried 3d out but don't care much about that.If you really want to test a TV's performance, record Las Vegas on TNTHD as it shows just about everything you would want to see for picture quality  bright colors, deep blacks,skin tones)and u will be able to see the outstanding picture quality.

TV arrived in perfect condition.I use this TV as our main TV for all types of viewing, it is in a pretty bright room, though there are no windows behind it. The screen is a little reflective, I think the \"real black filter\" is pretty effective. During the day when the sun shines on the white wall behind the TV darker scenes are a little tough to see. This hardly bothers me at all as minimal as it is.The picture quality on the TV out of the box is amazing, I didn't mess with any settings for a few weeks and was more than satisfied with the picture. The blacks are very deep, color is super rich/sharp, and the picture is unbelievably clear. CNET recently reviewed this TV calling it one of the best TVs they've ever reviewed, I'm now using the settings from their calibration and the TV looks even better.The remote is fine, it isn't the qwerty model like the D8000, it is just a regular clicker. Entering search text in the TV apps is a little difficult. I have the Android phone remote app, I use it when I want to do YouTube searches, Netflix searches, etc. The remote app only works if the TV is already on, meaning you can't power up the TV with the remote app. Otherwise the remote app is pretty cool, has different interfaces for different modes, TV or smart hub.I've used a few of the apps in the Smart Hub, my favorite so far being AllShare (DLNA) which plays files from the computer on the TV over the network. The network connection to the TV has to be wired for this application to work, it won't stream files if the TV is hooked wireless. I spent about half a day fooling around with some PC software provided by Samsung to make sharing for AllShare work, I later realized that this was unnecessary, all I ended up doing was enabling sharing in Windows Media Player and the files were available. I have about 50 video files in the Windows Media Library, AllShare takes around 1 minute to load the file list the first time I access it after the TV has been off. Most every video file type I've tried have played without problem, the exception being Matroska (.mkv) container files. Not having to hook the computer to the TV to play files is really nice. I have not tried to play any music.*** UPDATE ***MKV files will play on this TV, you have to rename them to .avi first.The sound on the TV is better than I expected. Since the TV is so thin I thought the built in sound might be poor, this is not the case. I have surround sound, but I usually use the TVs sound for non-movie watching and it is totally fine.I have not used the 3D capabilities of this TV.All and all I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely make it again and recommend others to buy this beast.

Better than any other i have seen. great color, deep blacks and handles fast motion with ease. I inspected the TV when I first recieved it and there was no peeling. After a few hours of watching I inspected it again and that's when I saw it. A little bubble about 9 inches from the top left of the screen. Thought it was a finger smudge at first so I wiped it with the blue cloth that comes with the TV. It disappeared for a few seconds and then slowly started coming back. I was very disappointed. I called Samsung to see what they would do, but the woman in customer service pretty much acted like she didn't believe me. I tried to point her to the various web sites that are deicated to addressing this peeling issue and she wasn't having it. After 10 minutes of back and forth I just hung up and called Amamzon to schedule the return. Amazon was awesome as always and understood completely. The peeling has not gotten any worse over the last few days, but i haven't been watching the TV so it hasn't had a chance to really heat up. Maybe it will never get any worse, but for a $2,000+ TV, I expect pretty much no flaws and espcially not design flaws. I will probably be getting a D6500 as they do not have the RBF so the peeling won't be an issue. My room is not brightly lit and only has 1 window off to the side so glare won't be an issue.

Oh did I mention that was for the TV with a 3D package including 2 pairs of 3D glasses, a 3D blueray player and the megamind 3D starter kit that had several 3D movies included?  Pretty awesome right?  Too bad Paul's TV would not honor that same package for their Amazon.com customers.  I see their name all over the listing and during my purchase.  They received my money.  Apparently that does not make me 'their customer' and I don't deserve the same level of service.  Amazon.com customer service offered me a small gift card as amends for Pauls TV but it is not enough to buy even one pair of the 3D glasses so it doesn't really help. Just a little warning.  The TV itself is great though.Update after a year and a half.  The TV has thin black vertical bars on one side.  I can't see them at all times but on certain colors, aka red, they suck.  Also, the SmartTV apps generally suck for this TV.  They don't tell you when you buy it, but they treat it as a subpar TV and it takes a long time for you to get apps that others get.  It took me like 8 months to get HBOGo which was available for pretty much every other TV made in this line.  I am still waiting on Amazon Prime.  Hear that Amazon?", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung PN51D7000 3D Plasma Review by 3D TV Buying Guide", "Author": "LCDTVBuyingGuide", "ReviewID": "R2NGDLSQZE4BLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picture Quality Rating (HD): 9/10We thoroughly enjoyed reviewing the C7000 plasma series last year and we know that these TVs can deliver a great picture quality. The D7000 series also renders a superb picture, but slightly different than what we saw last year. First, let's start with the Picture Mode options which are fairly limited compared to many TVs we review. Preset Modes are Dynamic, Standard, Movie, and Relax. The Relax and Movie modes are pretty solid right out the box. We ISF calibrated the picture from the Movie Mode to D6500K and post those picture settings on the next page. We then measured peak brightness and peak black to determine a range of contrast and this is where we were first surprised. Contrast measures about half on the D7000 series than it did last year. We found the reason for the decrease to be less light output (brightness) rather than black performance. We attribute this decrease to one or both of the following explanations: 1) Plasma panel Image retention (not burn in) issues could have influenced Samsung to decrease light output and/or 2) Samsung had to reduce light output to meet internal or external energy consumption reduction requirements. Indeed as it relates to the second possible reason, there is a yellow sticker affixed to the TV that states an average annual $28 in power costs. OK, I can see a small reduction in light output to accommodate the first of these, but power costs? I think I prefer to pay an extra $1 per month or even $2 more per month to get a better contrast ratio. Haven't we gone overboard enough with this energy efficiency when it comes to TVs? We here at 3D-TVBuyingGuide.com are proponents of the best picture quality possible and not at the expense of the lowering the power bill by a buck a month to meet an external non-profit agencies requirements.OK, that said, how is the picture quality? Excellent, just like last year. Colors are realistic and explosive, black levels are inky deep, dark shadow detail is excellent even with dark and light colors in the scene. The latter of these attributes is one of the traits that sets these plasma TVs apart from LED and LCD technologies. That and off center side angle viewing which is perfect on this plasma as it is with most. There is no false countouring or mapping of color information. The only weaknesses with the picture is judder jerkiness during slow panning side to side and peak light output. The first of these weaknesses is present in almost all TVs, the second causes us to recommend this TV for light controlled rooms.3D TV Viewing: 3D viewing is much improved from last year. The PN51D7000 is full HD active shutter 3D and comes with Samsung's 3D starter kit which includes 2 pairs of active shutter 3D glasses model SSD-3100GB and a Shrek 3D movie. The TV recognizes when the 3D glasses are synced and an alert pops up on the screen stating, \"3D Glasses are now connected.\" Many of the issues we noted last year are gone. There was no blurring in the bottom left and right corners of the screen. There was no crosstalk and flashing from the glasses from ambient room light. Images looked great and the depth is excellent depending on the 3D movie. The PND7000 3D plasma technology does justice to 3D technology. It certainly involves you in the picture. We did note some eye fatigue after viewing for a while but not as much as last year.Picture Quality Rating (Non-HD): 9/10Up conversion of lower end signals is very impressive on the PN51D7000. This is important due to the way we increasingly watch TV these days - through Internet TV programming like Netflix, Hulu and Vudu. These services do not always transmit their signals in HD and even when it is, it's usually a ramped down 720p HD rather than 1080p. Many times you are watching something akin to 480i or 480p resolution. So a good quality up conversion in a TV is essential and to get this you will likely need to go to a more high end solution like the D7000. Color information was very good despite the fact that you cannot adjust picture settings from the Smart Hub Internet options. The tools key will get you into the Sound Mode options but that's it. Nevertheless, in the end we were happy with the color, black levels, and especially the dark shadow detail on this TV.Features Rating: 9.5Internet Connectivity Smart Hub: Samsung's Smart Hub has probably the best selection of Internet TV Apps and Options on the market. There are the usual must haves like Netflix, Vudu, Hulu Plus, ESPN, USA Today, AP, Accuweather. Some of the Apps are more worthy than others. The MLB.tv App shows todays game times and scores, and standings but no video clips or reruns. If you want to access the games, you'll have to subscribe to the premium service. Many small Apps like Pac man or various workout video apps cost between .99 and 2.99 each. One drawback of Samsung's Smart Hub is that you cannot access the picture menu to calibrate the picture. You must just watch it as it comes in - not that performance is poor, it isnt at all, but it's always nice to be able to calibrate the settings.Design and Appearance: The Samsung PN51D7000 looks much the same as the PND8000 series from last year except with a thinner framing bezel. It's a great looking set. The thin 1\" brushed charcoal metallic finish lends a very expensive look and the depth of the TV is the same at just 1.4\". There is a thick glass edging all the way around the TV. The screen when off is a deep rich charcoal color. The TV comes with a solidly built heavy table top which swivels 21 degrees side to side. Lastly, the neck is a clear acrylic piece that makes the TV look as if it's floating in air.Audio Output Quality: Audio output was impressive from the 10W X 10W speakers. Compared to most super thin TVs these days, sound from the PND7000's speakers is much fuller with more base and better quality. There was plenty of volume to fill a large room at the 50% level. There are impressively 5 Sound Mode options whereas most TVs only have two. We have preferred the Clear Voice option in the past so give that one a try. The Standard mode is also good. Music was not great but we felt the sound quality was well balanced.Value Rating: 9.5/10The PN51D7000 is an extremely attractive TV that has a classy and expensive looking casing to go with a superb picture quality and features. With excellent 3D performance and great black levels this TV is tough to compete with at a price $1647 from authorized online dealers. A Samsung 3D starter kit with 2 pairs of 3D shutter glasses and a free 3D movie or two will cost an extra $398 - though some retailers may charge a higher price for the TV but include the starter kit.See the full review along with our video review at 3D TV Buying Guide", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent plasma with a few minor issues", "Author": "Johnnie B", "ReviewID": "R5GFWPO3VB32Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Earlier in 2011, I purchased the LG 60PZ550 to replace my Samsung PN50B550. At that point, I was satisfied with the LG. The picture was ok and it's packed with features for a very low price (similarly priced to PN59D550) so it represented an excellent value.  Still, I was left feeling somewhat lacking and deliberated on returning it but decided to keep it... until when the PN59D7000 was released. My return period on the LG was just about to expire so I returned it and purchased the Sammy. I admittedly, have become a video snob. Paid $400 more for 1\" less screen. The awesome Panny VT30's were out also but man, they're expensive! A grand more for 5\" less? Just couldn't do it and the PN59D7000 is right up there with it. The D8000 was $200 more than the 7000 but all you get is the qwerty remote, web browser, Skype capability and ARC. Picture is identical even though the D8000 has the LCE (Local Contrast Enhancer). Also the four spoke base is odd looking to me.I now had this TV for 3 months. This is Samsung's best ever.The pros:-Color presentation is the best, perhaps ever across all brands and types. It is regarded as reference grade. This is the one aspect of the D7000/8000 that makes it stand out from the rest of the pack.-Excellent blacks and shadow detail, though not the best of the top tier plasmas but close. Samsung has really improved on this but still a half step behind Panasonic.-Motion smoothness, pan smoothness, 24p mode and other video processing features are great.-This is the first plasma to impress me with handling ambiant light and reflections. Effective anti-glare coating. What a world of a difference this is to the mirror like LG.-Loaded with features, online content. Haven't used it much since they're a duplication to my blu-ray HTIB online stuff. Works well when I tried them.-Looks good. This is low on my priority list but is important to some. Thin bezel, thin profile, nice \"titanium(?)\" color. The normal rectangular stand, no spokes.-3D picture is very good with minimal ghosting and crosstalk.  TV review sites note the Samsung plasmas to deliver excellent 3D.  The active glasses makes the picture a bit dim though.As far as picture quality, looks and features go, it's one of the best at hundreds less than the competition.Cons:-No ARC, audio return channel. This is a bummer for those who have a surround sound system with HDMI but there are work-arounds (ARC available on D8000).-Reliability concerns. Previous reviewers noted that the anti-glare coat peel. I've heard many of these reports. I've logged nearly 600 hours (50 hrs/wk, 12 weeks) on this TV and no peel so far. I also heard that Samsung is aware and will honor repairs. See Samsung's statement below:\"Samsung has become aware that the mylar screen filter on a small number of its 2011 Plasma TVs are starting to peel. The mylar filter is a protective coating on the screen and does not affect the performance of the TV. Customers that are experiencing this issue should call 1-800-SAMSUNG. We would be happy to repair the TV at no cost to the customer. Samsung is committed to delivering quality products; we will investigate all consumer inquiries and resolve the matter to our customers' satisfaction.\"I have to give this TV 5 stars until the reliability concerns become actual issues.  If it does become an issue, hopefully Samsung won't give me too much grief.Issues:Buzzing - no excessive buzzing on my unit. There are some complaints out there but I think altitude is the major factor.  I believe this is inherent problem for all plasmas.  No problems here in GA but I probably wouldn't buy one if I lived in Denver.Black level rise - at 600 hrs, haven't noticed a difference since the day I got it, though 600 hrs isn't a long time. Still has that deep, inky blacks.Brightness pops - yes, there's some brightness pops but I don't think it's that distracting.  It's infrequent and so quick, most will miss its occurance.  Panasonics had the same problem last year and fixed with firmware.  Hopefully Samsung gets one out here shortly.Other notes:Most \"expert\" calibrators state that MOVIE picture mode is the best and most accurate.  The settings I found on the web were consensus MOVIE mode, Warm 2,with some variability in BRIGHTNESS, COLOR, TINT, SHARPNESS, etc settings.  While these suggested settings was an improvement over default settings, I found that RELAX mode was the best.  This is just a personal preference.DYNAMIC mode is overblown with great loss of shadow detail.  The colors really pop but makes everything cartoony.STANDARD is too dim and probably only there to qualify the TV for Energy Star compliance.MOVIE is good and most experts like this mode but I feel there's too much of a green push.RELAX seemed to provide the best shadow detail in dark scenes and colors pop more so than MOVIE.  It's also brighter than MOVIE mode without sacrificing black level giving it better contrast.  No green push which, to me, displays purer whites.  Not sure if the color accuracy is better or worse.  Judging by the experts, it may be worse but I still prefer this setting.My settings:RELAX modeBRIGHTNESS - 54COLOR - 53TINT - 50/50SHARPNESS - 5WARM 1 (WARM 2 seem too hot)Again, just a personal preference.  See for yourself.  Put the suggested MOVIE settings (can be found via web search) and the RELAX setting and flip between the two on a dark scene and a colorful scene.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Picture Quality, Great Value, But a Little Buggy", "Author": "mirak \"mirak\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZEQKZ5BRNBKC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been running a Samsung pn64d7000 for several weeks now.  The picture did not look that good right out of the box, but it really shines with a little calibration.  I upgraded from the highly praised Panasonic 50v10, and the Samsung PQ is every bit as good.  Nice deep blacks, nice bright whites, good color - just an overall vivid, contrasty picture.  What little 3D I've seen looks good.I've got this TV hanging in my living room, with a wall full of north-facing windows that allow plenty of ambient light, but washout is minimal.  The filters on this TV do a great job of reducing reflections.  Also, I hear no \"buzz\" unless I turn off the audio and place my ear within about 2 feet of the screen.Cosmetically, the TV is incredibly thin and has a beautiful design with a super-thin bezel.  Remote control is decent.  It gets the job done if you're not using a nicer universal remote.I only have two complaints that cause me to remove a star.  First, you can't fully customize your video inputs.  I would like to be able to \"turn off\" or set to \"skip\" all the inputs I don't use so that way I can easily scroll between just the 3 HDMI inputs I do use, but you can't do that on this TV.Second, my TV freaked out when I was first setting it up because a \"Network Remote Control\" setting was toggled on.  This setting allows you to use your iPhone or other wireless devices as a remote control.  However, my TV was picking up some sort of wireless interference that it was interpreting as remote control signals.  I had to unplug the TV to get it to stop.  When I powered it back on, I quickly toggled off this option and haven't experienced the problem since.Finally, as I mentioned, the PQ is not all that great right out of the box, which could be a drawback for those who don't want to tweak picture settings.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wow...", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "RLXC9KA010VSG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We went down to that yellow tag box store and purchased a Panasonic Viera TC-P50ST30 and I was all excited.  That night while watching it however I noticed that movement blurred.  Hockey pucks, race cars, action scenes...and god help you in a panoramic zoomed out movie shot.  Needless to say I was gutted, especially since my days or research had indicated that the Panasonic was amazing.  So, another day of research later and I was looking at the Samsung PN51D7000 being reviewed here.  Every review, both professional and consumer, loved it.  TV of the year etc.  Problem was I couldn't find one local to look at.  Bes....er, I mean that yellow tag store said they could order them in but no stores stocked them.  Amazon was something like $500 cheaper...and I've ordered a LOT from amazon, seldom disappointed.  So I took a chance and ordered the 51.The tag store has a 30 day return policy so I hung onto the panasonic until this one arrived 7 days after I ordered it.  A side by side test was in order.  Standing in the store under their special lighting watching TV's programed and tweaked by the factory guys, it's often difficult for me to see much of a difference.  Standing in my living room...it wasn't even close.  This Samsung PN51D7000 was so far and away better than the Panasonic that I thought the Panasonic must be defective.  I returned it the next day.  By the way, you know that 30 day trouble free return policy they love to brag about?  Pfft..not even close.  They made me stand around the store for 30 minutes while they put the TV through a battery of tests.  Then told me it wasn't defective..why was I returning it?  Told them I didn't like the blurring action scenes.  Sir, all TV's do that.  I told them I didn't like the color of the plastic around the screen and the remote was cold to the touch.  If they didn't refund my card that night, I wouldn't lose any sleep because American Express would pull it from their account tomorrow.  I got a lot of dirty looks, but they returned it.  Very odd experience.Back to the Samsung.  Have I mentioned we love it?  My wife's words: \"The picture is so sharp it almost looks 3D\".  It will do 3d as well...but we haven't gone there yet.

I based my selection on several reviews I had read -- both users and experts -- and have not been disappointed.  Good overall picture quality, love the slim cabinet (1.25 inches thick)and how it looks on the stand and because this model is a Smart TV with built in wi-fi, I have been watching a lot of Netflix movies (30 day free trial).  I was pleasantly surprised that using Netflix and other apps from Samsung, that movies and other content stream flawlessly from my router (which is located upstairs) to my TV (which is in our family room downstairs).  The only problem so far is when trying to access the 3D app supplied by Samsung to view their 3D content, the picture is constantly stopping every 10 seconds or so in order to buffer about 4 seconds of content -- this is extremely annoying and after trying several times to view the 3D content, I just gave up.  3D movies, however, play flawlessly thru the included 3D blu-ray player (at least so far) but as far as I can tell there is little 3D content out there other than a few animated movies like Shrek.Hooking the TV up via HDMI cables obviously a plus and very easy (PS for those shopping for HDMI cables, buy the cheapest ones you can find because all HDMI's are digital, they either work or they don't, and premium cables don't work any better than less expensive ones.  I paid less than $4.00 each for mine and they work fine).Have not been able to figure out how to view Netflix movies and get surround sound thru my surround speakers.  I have an older Sony surround sound receiver that I connect via RCA's.  Going from the TV to inputs on the receiver does not work.  If any one has a suggestion, please let me know.And, as has always been my experience, Amazon provided a good price for the TV and it came with a free 3D blu-ray player, 2 pairs of 3D glasses and a couple movies -- total cost $1,399, no sales tax and shipping was free.  Plus the freight company that Amazon contracted to deliver the TV, brought it into the house, unpacked the TV, put it on the stand, connected the TV to my coax cable and made sure everything was working properly before they left.

The calibration controls are top notch with a CMS that works and 10pt Gamma/Grayscale. This is my 4th plasma and it's the best so far. Surprisingly, and this is my first Samsung, its very quiet. I have always been able to hear buzz, but not with the set unless Im real close. The filter that comes on this set and the 8000 is very good at handling reflection, also best Ive seen yet. Samsung video processing is of course great and the design of the set (especially a 64\" that actually swivels) is pretty impressive.With such a little difference, Id recommend this over the 8000, and it's a huge deal when considering what a 65\" VT30 is going to cost. Yes the VT30 will have ISF day and night, as well as (most likely) a lower black level, but we are talking $1500-$1700 here. IMO, the D7000 is the best bang for the buck this year if you are getting it calibrated.7 month update: Still loving the display, best plasma I've owned yet. My March build did not suffer the peeling filter (at 1300+ hours now) but I do experience floating blacks from time to time. Not a deal breaker, because 95% of the time I have no complaints at all.

I have had some image retention but going into the menu's and running the burn in conditioner (scrolling bars for 10 mins gets rid of that no problem.Side note: Lag is not an issue on this TV - benifit over LCD plus fast moving games look great and not a blur fest-Heat: There is a good amount of heat that comes off the display if you are running the pixels near their max brightness-Sound: The sound from the internal speakers is actually pretty good. Its no 7.1 surround sound (however it does have a virtual surround sound that does an okay job).

WOW is all I can say. I could of prob got to that setting by playing around with the settings a bunch but it was easier to have him do it. I will tell you though that he set the pixel brightness to 16 ;)I also tried out 3D last night with Megamind. I was actually pretty impressed. It looked a lot better than the 3D I have seen in movie theaters prob due to the fact that it wasn't so dark (downside of polarized 3D) You can adjust how much the picture jumps out at you.

I was initially worried about watching content with static bars or games with constant HUD elements, but we've been using this Television aggressively and have not been able to conjure up its flaws. Obviously far less of a problem with newer PDP technology, but still worth bringing to consumer attention.Once calibrated, this TV is gorgeous. It also looks equally as gorgeous when it's displaying no picture. Makes a wonderful center piece for my family's home theater and entertainment center.The bezel looks very good and Samsung's design is slim enough to allow me to use a stand with integrated mount meant for a 60' television and still provide enough room around the outside for proper air flow.Ultimately, we are very satisfied with our purchase. My only gripe is the buzzing, but I'm only reminded of that when the A/V Receiver is switching inputs. Once any level of volume is applied, the buzzing problem goes out the window. I have heard of users who have had their buzzing diminish substantially or even completely after the TV's phosphors had aged past the 200 hour vibrant mark, but I'm not holding on to hope for that. Not a huge problem in the first place.It is hard to give it an accurate review after having only owned it for a week and a half. But if and when anything disappointing/displeasing should occur, i will swiftly update this review for those who may also be on the wall with their expensive purchase. I am pleased enough at this point to positively review it.*Update 1/18/13*5 star review has now become a 1 star based upon the company which produces this television. The internal panel is cracked with no physical damage to the exterior. Samsung will not honor the warranty even knowing this is a problem on their end. I'm leaving the rest of the review as my impression of the television set itself remains the same, but I cannot recommend a television of this caliber and price that will last less than a year. They are quite obviously out of production now that it is 2013, but from what I have read, this still remains a problem with their plasma panels. Please take note when you are deciding where to invest your $2000-3000. I was thrilled with this set and had hoped it would last my family and I for years to come, but only one year later I am having to spend the same amount of money on a new set. I will not be purchasing a Samsung product again.

After three weeks of enjoying this TV's superb picture quality I decided to return it for three reasons.  Mainly - it does buzz constantly!!!  Samsung on their support site will explain this as normal plasma sound.  However, after reading reviews of other plasma TV brands, I didn't find as many complaints, almost no reviews about this issue.  Maybe it's my sensitive hearing, but even at low volumes my wife and I could hear buzzing noise emitting from the center of the screen.  Second reason - the screen's real black filter was useless in my case.  If you will have a window with see through shades in front of it, you will have to live with window reflections even during cloudy days.  At night the quality is excellent!

Nearly six months later, I can safely say that this is an INCREDIBLE set.  The picture is fantastic, with nearly the brightness of an LED without the uniformity and clouding issues.  Of course I was nervous about the (now-fixed) peeling issue, but I was lucky and my set has had no peeling issues, no buzzing, and no brightness pops.  I cannot recommend this TV highly enough, and this was after doing months of research on the Sony HX929, Panny VT30 and owning two sets of the UND8000.  The calibration controls are amazing, including DAY and NIGHT CAL in the service menu, and it's extremely easy to use.  I didn't think I'd care for the 3D, but it's really something else.  I enjoy 3D Blu Rays on this TV more than I do in the theater; it's a totally different experience!  The PND7000 is the best value of 2011 hands down.

We watched a lot of HD television on our older 42\" Samsung plasma and always thought it looked good, but with this new TV the HD content looks even more amazing. The picture is sharp, but not unnaturally so, like with the a lot of the LCD LED screens we looked at. The 3D works great as well, we watched a couple movies and not once did my eyes feel strained.I also love the connectivity of the TV, I hooked it up to our network (through ethernet but it has wireless as well) and it reads movies off our Synology NAS with no problems, and it plays almost all of the movie formats I've tried. It wont read ISOs but thats no fault of Samsung or its software. The EHub system can seem a little sluggish at but works well, and looks nice as well. We watch a lot of netflix streamed movies, so not having to turn on the xbox to use it is a nice plus. I'm looking forward to any additional features they add with firmware updates. Its older brother, the 8000 series, connects to the world wide web, but I have a laptop, smart phone and ipad, I have no need for a browser on the television.Pros:- Great picture, 2D and 3D. Sharp with out being over done and the brightness and colors look great (once calibrated). Had no eyestrain watching movies made for 3D.- The sound seemed much better in comparison to the old flatscreen I had, but I have been using my home theater system after its initial set up.- Internet connectivity. It connects to Netflix, Hulu Plus, Vudu (you get 1 free rental), YouTube, Pandora and a bunch of other apps. Downloading the applications is fairly simple. Use an ethernet connection for the best experience.- I play a lot of games, and haven't had any issues with burn-in.Cons:- Minor gripe for me. There is only an optical audio line for outgoing audio, which is fine for me since I happened to have an extra cord and input available but it should have been at the bottom and they also should offered some analog options as well.- Slightly sluggish interface in the EhubOverall:A great TV, especially for the price. It did need a bit of calibration before the picture quality was at one I liked, but all TVs should be calibrated anyways. The only other TV I would consider was a Panasonic plasma, which looked as nice if not a little bit nicer, but was more expensive and didn't have the connectivity I wanted. The PN51D7000 set just looked nicer over all too.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Initial Impressions from a TV Fanatic", "Author": "New to Plasma", "ReviewID": "R24UA5VVZEIPBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Anyone who knows me understands that I am not an impulse buyer, especially when it comes to video-audio equipment; between online research (CNET, AVSforum) and several trips to brick and mortars over the past year, I finally decided on the Samsung PN59D7000.  Just for perspective, my choices were between the Samsung PN59D7000, Panasonic VT30 (55\") and Sony HX929 (55\"); I am a happy owner of a Sony XBR4 (46\") for nearly 5 years (not a single problem) and was hesistant to transition to a plasma.  Between reports of screen peeling, rising black levels, buzzing, brightness \"pops\", green \"blobs\", and cross-talk, I figured patience would pay off in the long run until manufacturers \"perfected\" plasma; on the other hand, I figured defaulting to another LCD (this time LED LCD) would be the safer bet, as I enjoy a combination of HD DirecTV, XBOX 360, PS3, and Blu-Ray.  I was able to finally \"take the plunge\" after seeing all three sets in person and taking into account the competetive price points associated with Amazon.com; I purchased the Samsung through Paul's TV (fulfilled by Amazon) last week and it arrived yesterday through CEVA shipping services.  I have divided my review into several categories because each has its own impressions.Shipping and UnpackingThis was the most disappointing experience with the whole on-line shopping experience, thus far.  First of all, the delivery service noted \"White Glove Delivery\" (?), but what actually happened did not really satisfy that description.  The delivery representative, only one mind you, parked the truck outside my house, but refused to pull in my driveway for liability reasons (?).  Next, I assisted the represenative with unloading the box as it was too heavy for one person to move; also, it was clearly marked on the box \"Two people minimum to carry\".  Next, the representative remained on-site long enough to allow me to visually inspect the exterior of the box, unpack the television, and visually inspect the screen; what does that mean: I did not receive any help with constructing the tv stand, placing the tv on the stand, or inspecting the functionality by plugging it in first (thanks goes to my friends for that!).  The delivery service remained at my house for less than 5 minutes; overall, I am not sure how other delivery services operate, but this was unsatisfactory according to any standards of practice.ExteriorFirst things first, this television could double for a piece of fine furniture when turned off; the brushed metal bezel edged with a thin clear frame sets this television apart from its competitors.  Initially, I thought I preferred the \"frameless one sheet of glass\" construction of the Panasonic and Sony, but after looking at the Samsung over the past day, I can certainly say that Samsung went the extra mile to make the television as aesthetcally appealing as it is functional.  The stand construction feels appropriately weighted and balanced to hold this hulking television; please keep in mind that the Owner's Manual advises that you lay the television on its face to install the stand (????), but I preferred to have two people elevate the television enough to screw in the base.  Also, I like that the stand has a swivel function to fine tune for optimal viewing pleasure (no tilt function, however).  The overall thin presenation of the television will please wall-mount enthusiasts, however I perferred to admire this television on the matching brushed metal base stand.  The screen demonstrates minimal glare or reflection under flourescent lighting, but I cannot report on natural light sources and respective glare as the television remains in a dark room.Start-Up/User FriendlinessAs with most televisions these days, a brief and easily instructed intialization setup prompts you upon start-up;  Samsung keeps it relatively easy at the starting gates, by allowing you to select time zone, store/home mode, and network setup.  I did not have any problems linking the television to my Linksys Wireless-N Router and was quickly introduced to the setup menus upon start up (more on that later).  The included remote gets the job done without any compliants; I do appreciate the backlight function when trying to adjust settings in a dark room.Picture Quality** My Samsung PN59D7000 is a November 2011 build.As I said before, my lack of experience with plasma televisions and over-abundance of research has left me feeling very nervous (borderline paranoid) about image retention and burn-in.  First off, I have this television in a completely dark room, no windows, so I adjusted the contrast and brightness to 45% on start-up, as well as lowered the cell light to 5.  I will most likely \"break-in\" the television over the next 100 hours with these settings, before programming in custom calibration settings.  Even with the Eco Solution settings engaged (power saver: high), I could easily disntinguish the picture clarity, color accuracy, and screen uniformity over my Sony.  To say that I am picky about picture quality would be an understatement, but you have to see it to really believe it; and I don't mean look at \"torch mode\" in a brick and mortar, though.  With the vast array of picture calibration settings available on this Samsung, I am certain that any videophile will be able to adjust this set to cater to their personal viewing area and tastes.  As far as content, I viewed a combination of SD and HD programming on DirecTV, PS3 Blu-Ray, XBOX 360, and 3D Blu-Ray, all using Monster M1000 Series HDMI cables.  Overall, the picture is astounding on this television, including judder-free motion, deep inky blacks, and accurate color spectrum; also, I did not notice any brightness \"pops\" unless I engaged the auto brightness control for lighting conditions under the Eco Solutions panel.  Even then, I only noticed the television adjust one time each when I turned the lights on or off.  Further, I noticed a very slight \"buzz\" sound from the front bezel upon start-up, but it lowers to a soft humming sound similar to the cooling fan on a XBOX 360 Slim as the set remains on.** Samsung has included several tools to reduce the risk of image retention, including pixel shift, scrolling screen savers, and auto-off mode; all of these tools are easily located and accessed through the settings menu.  Personally, I am going to use a series of graded color panel images loaded on a USB drive to \"break-in\" the phosphors over the next 100 hours.Sound QualityEven though I prefer to use my Denon 1712/Infinity 7.1 surround sound system for movies and gaming, I will not be embarassed to have company hear the stock speakers under regular listening conditions.  The standard listening mode is somewhat underwhelming (hollow), but the SRS Surround provides a deeper, more fulfilling sound that can fill the room even at volume setting 10; the dialog boost function is minimal, but I suppose useful in some applications.  I have cycled through the various listening modes offered in the options menu, and each provides respective accents to voice, background sound, and music tracks as applicable.3D FunctionI applaud Samsung for lowering the price on the battery-operated 3100 series 3d glasses to a reasonable level, as I have had to purchase a total of 5 for my family; I will probably need to purchase more for visiting family members and friends, but at least I will not feel like am breaking the bank, or raising my anxiety, when my children or relatives are handling them.  Overall, the glasses feel lightweight and comfortable on the bridge of your nose; my children did not complain at all, and I am the only person that wears glasses in the family.  The 3d glasses sync quickly with the television (yeah Bluetooth vs. IR) and only shows minimal signs of cross-talk when you adjust the 3D level (field of depth) to +4/+5 in the options menu.  I also found it interesting that the 3D picture does not distort when you turn your head sideways, as if you were laying down or in a reclined position; take note, try this on a Sony and you will see terrible flicker and lose the 3d image altogether.  I watched Avatar and Tron: Legacy in 3D and was amazed by the smooth motion and natural sense of perspective offerred by the Samsung.  For those of you prone to motion sickness, I would be careful with some of the \"flying\" sequences in today's films as they are quite believable in 3D.  The 3D glasses do dim the picture somewhat, but my contrast/brightness settings probably contribute to that effect as well.Internet Function/Smart HubI will probably not use many of internet applications offerred by this television, as I already use Netflix through my XBOX 360; however, there are definitely some applications that I will tinker with over the next month, and update my review accordingly.SummaryOverall, the Samsung PN59D7000 has exceeded my initial expectations as a plasma owner; I have only had the television for 24 hours, and will update my review with any relevant information as it becomes avaiable.  If you are still on the fence about purchasing a plasma television, or entering the realm of 3d, I strongly recommend Samsung as a choice to consider this holiday season.

Others may have better luck - the picture that the set produces is really nice and the calibration controls provided by Samsung are competent - so it may be worth trying out - Amazon's return policy certainly makes this an easy, if not somewhat time consuming, proposition.  There are plenty of people that are happy with this unit and I have no doubt that the extent to which this issue bothers users is dependent on not only the installation and room characteristics, but also the hearing acuity of viewers.

But finally, with that TV dying after 7 years, and the Samsung under $2000.00, it was time.I was very hesitant to order based on the screen brightness pops and damaged during delivery, but already had other Samsung LCD TV's installed in my house, this would be my first plasma.I scheduled delivery on a Tuesday. The delivery company, Pilot called me the Thursday before and said if I wanted, I could get it delivered the next day on Friday. So I opted for this option and took off work. On Friday, they called saying that they could not deliver it and would have to reschedule for Tuesday again. I contacted Amazon and they graciously offered a $50.00 discount off the delivery issue.TV was delivered and unboxed by the delivery guys. I asked if they could put on the base and they did.I did not notice the screen brightness pops until 3 days after using it. It was not significant but maybe a few times over the course of a few hours and only at night. I calibrated it based on CNET, turned off the ECO setting, downloaded and installed a firmware update and after 2 weeks use, the screen brightness issues no longer appear.Overall, the image is unbelievable and 3D is superb. Watching Avatar in 3D is IMO better than in the theater. (I do prefer the SSG-3100 #D glasses over the new SSG-3050. As of 1/1/2012, the SSG-3100's are discontinued, so I recommend you order additional pairs now before they're all gone)I have no buzzing issue and as far as heat goes, I noticed it slightly if I walk by it within a foot, but who cares.Wireless works fine, but it does not have Amazon streaming video's. Good thing I bought a Panasonic BD-210 Bluray to do that. They work great together.I have watched both the comparable Panasonic Plasma and think both sets are equal in terms of performance.

We already have 2 Samsung LCD HDTV's but this is my first plasma and I found it very noticeable that there are differences in an LCD image versus plasma.  My initial impressions were not immediately positive but a lot of that has to do with being accustomed to an LCD image.  I have spent quite a bit of time tweaking my settings and now prefer the look of the plasma as compared to our LCD sets, although they are very good too.  The brightness of the LCD is nice but this plasma seems to display a more natural, realistic image and the brightness level can easily be adjusted.  I was concerned about how this TV would perform in a room that is very bright during the day time but it does very well.  Positives include very good off angle viewing, deep, rich, lifelike colors, screen uniformity, great setting options, decent sound and very deep blacks.  A few minor issues include the fact that, when there is a bright white background, the color can be dull and almost gray compared to an LCD that can produce a bright white background.  This isn't a big issue for me because it's most noticeable in TV commercials that use an all white background.  The PN51D7000 produces great whites when it's not the dominant color on the screen.  I wish there was an analog audio output but I overcame this issue with the FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter found on Amazon.  Netflix can be sluggish when accessing it and waiting for it to respond but once the movie gets started, everything is fine.  Fast motion such as sports is generally very good but some minor smearing is noticeable at times.  Not sure if this is the HDTV or limitations of the image that is being broadcast.  The E Manual owner's manual is poor at best.  As noted in reviews I have read, shadow detail could be better.

My previous TV was a 40\" samsung lcd, and I really enjoyed it. Like many people I decided to upgrade, and so far it has been a great decision. I was a little nervous about plasma due to IR (image retention) problems which I know are not as much of a problem as they used to be, due to different types of phosphers they use now. Also I work in a restaurant that has a 60\" samsung plasma, and we have been using it for 16 hours every day for the last four years and it does not have any image retention. I recommend if you are looking to buy a new tv, use the AVS Forum website then type in the tv that you interested in buying. I found a wealth of information in the AVS forum for the pn51d7000 there is a a whole section dedicated to the Plasma d7000 and d8000 series. They talk about calibrating, problems with the models, what works great what doesn't. Sometimes it can get a little to techy for me, but thats why we have google to help us understand what these people are talking about.Overall the TV is great! Picture quality is awesome and I haven't had any problems at all with the set. 3d is really cool especially while playing Black Ops and watching 3d blu rays. Blu Ray movies are so clear especially with the cinema smooth feature enabled. I enjoy being able to calibrate and tweak all the differant settings to find that perfect picture.I was originally looking at the 55st30 or 50gt30 but the price of the 3d glasses and the lack of the calibration options was a deal breaker for me. Also I just wanted to stay with samsung since my lcd still works great after 5 years.Good luck everyone, just remember people can tell you which TV is best and greatest, but it all just comes down to your own eyes and what looks good to you.Update**Tv is still working great. I have no image retention no screen peeling. The picture is still great on the tv it still surprises me.There is some brightness fluctuation in some of the video games I play, but not enough to warrant a lower rating on the tv. Honestly I don't use the 3d feature that much the glasses that came with my shrek, megamind 3d starter kit are kinda uncomfortable. I would recommend buying the higher end glasses.Well my tv now has some spider like cracks on the inside of the glass. I woke up to it this morning. You can definitely see it when the tv is off or in very dark scenes of movies.  It seems like a problem with the d7000 and 8000. I Google it this morning and seems to be an issue with quite a few others as well. These cracks magically appearing only after a year warrant a new rating of three stars.

With school out, the TV is on nearly 8 hrs a day.  I had previously read about a buzzing noise emitting from the speakers and it is noticeable in low volumes.  The quality of the sound emitting from the Samsung is not very good.  I disengaged the TV's speakers and route all audio thru my home theater system and I do not hear the buzz.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.

This was not done.We unpacked the tv and inspected it to make sure there was no damage and it was indeed like new.  We also plugged it in and there was a picture.  We paid $250.00 to have this tv mounted and installed.  After 2 days, we are now unable to get the tv to power on.  After going to the Samsung website and reviewing what it said about the problem we're having, the tv had an \"internal\" problem and was defective.I contacted Amazon to see what needed to be done for warranty thru Samsung.  They contacted Samsung, while I held, who stated that since it was \"open box\", there was NO WARRANTY at all on the tv.  We had purchased a Square Trade Warranty which was supposed to kick in after the Samsung warranty expired.  There was absolutely nothing in the description of the warehouse deal that said that I would have no warranty whatsoever from the manufacturer.  They did say that the Square Trade warranty would cover the tv, but with it being a new tv, we decided to return the tv to Amazon under their 30 day return policy and purchase a new one.

At the time, we were upgrading from a 2006 model TX-50PX77U 50\" Panasonic 720p TV (which was a warranty replacement from the previous year's 50\" model that had the notorious Panasonic \"purple snakes\" problem with high contrast areas). We used a plasma break-in DVD on it for 100 hours, then set up the colors according to some experts on AVSForum's website. The picture looked AMAZING ... for 4 days, after which point the TV refused to turn on. I would have been pretty annoyed at Samsung, but having just gone through the rigamarole with Panasonic (and multiple service tech attempts to fix that set before finally just swapping it), I consoled myself with the fact that sometimes these things just happen. But when they do, you sure hope you have good customer support to fall back on. Thankfully, Amazon has an amazing TV return policy, so we got our request in for a swap. It took over a month to get the new set here, but it was completely hassle-free.I ran the plasma break-in DVD on the new set for 100 hours in August 2011, and it's been going strong ever since. We've easily played over 500 hours of video games in that time between our whole family, and we've never encountered any lasting ghosting or burn-in issues. The colors are great, the 3D works very well (we actually prefer the 2D-to-3D conversion on some video games versus their own built-in 3D modes, as you can control the strength of the effect), and the set is very sleek and attractive looking. I can't comment too much on the built-in speakers since we use a surround sound setup and only tested them briefly, but I do have to say that I think the decision to make them rear-facing is somewhat ridiculous. I'm sure it was done in the interest of \"form over function\" to make the set look as slim and trim from the front as possible. It at least gives customers an option for built-in sound versus nothing at all, but if you don't have a separate speaker system, the audio is definitely going to be lacking. Your best bet in that case is to have the TV positioned close to a wall so the sound can bounce back towards you. If you're going to invest in a TV this nice, though, you'd be wise to at least buy a decent-quality sound bar (Amazon sells several) so you can truly enjoy the picture by having quality audio to go with it.My only other gripe with this TV is the anti-glare coating. My old Panasonic set diffused light sources nicely, so that while they might slightly brighten up one area of the screen, they didn't really distract you. Samsung's anti-glare, on the other hand, doesn't seem to do anything to really mitigate lights or windows in our room. I can clearly see light bulbs reflecting in the screen with crisp detail, whereas with my Panasonic they would just be a fuzzy area of brightness.I'm rating this TV 4 out of 5 stars, deducting a star for the speaker placement and the anti-glare. However, if I was rating it on picture quality alone, I'd give it a solid 5 out of 5 stars.

It isn't a light TV, but for a plasma of that size I thought it would be much heavier.

This time they replaced the TV.The new TV is just as loud when measured with a SPL meter but it has a slightly lower pitch.  To give you a basis of comparison, the buzz off my Panasonic Pro 50inch from 2004 measures at 60-65dB.  If you have good hearing and have spent a lot of money on your audio set up I would avoid this TV.From and aesthetic point of view it is hard to find a TV designed as well.

I can't confirm if the competitor's TV's are quieter.  The difference between the noise level with my old 50 inch TV may be due to the additional screen size.In summary, if you are rich and picky with good hearing and an expensive audio setup, get the Pioneer Elite LCD.

A wide range of apps for video (hulu, netflix, vudu, etc.) - we do not have any cable connection. We only use the buit-in apps for all our TV time.6. DLNA - works very well for streaming videos and songs from laptops and cell phones.Cons:1. Can be slow - specially when TV turns on and you have to go to SMART TV (all apps, etc.). Also, browsing through the apps is pretty slow.2. Apps - not all apps are ideal. Netflix takes time to start and stop, and the TV menu gets limited when you are using these apps. For some, you do not have access to any of the TV settings. They have a mind of their own.3. App Store - This TV does not support Amazon VOD. also, browsing through the app store is a pain. It is slow and the sorting is not ideal. The user experience can be more intuitive.4. No ARC (audio return channel) HDMI connectivity: which is now a standard on almost all home theater systems.5. Audio output slots - ONLY one !! It has only a digital audio output slot.6. No web browser. We did not think we would need a web browser, and hence, got the 7000 instead of the 8000.

After worrying it would be too big (we sit about 13 feet away), we quickly realized there is truth to those that say you never regret going with a bigger screen, especially when when watching 3D.The Netflix and rest of the apps from the Smart HUB was responsive and seemed to work rather well. The wife especially Oooo and Ahhh'd at the Social TV allowing her to Facebook while watching Soap Operas.There was no audible buzzing and the vivid colors really popped. Unfortunately that is not all that \"popped\". In scenes where there was panning that transitioned from the majority of the screen being dark to light both my wife and I started seeing a strobe-light effect across the entire display, as if the color was jumping in brightness scales. This quickly became annoying when viewing some material.With the brightness pops I cannot help but feel like I've purchased a defective product. Until such time as it's fixed by a firmware update my review stands at 1 star.

Ultimately decided on this because it was rated one of the top TV's of 2011 by cnet reviews. 4 stars instead of 5 because of noticeable brightness fluctuations. Other than that, this TV produces an astonishing picture!Pro's- OUTSTANDING picture, I can't rave enough on how excellent the picture is on this set. One of the best I've seen. Incredible black levels, contrast, and picture sharpness. It will blow you away.- Black levels. This TV has incredible deep, dark black levels, producing an amazingly crisp picture. Simply phenomenal.- For a plasma, this screen produces very little glare compared to most. I have eastern facing windows which flood my living room with light (directly on the TV at times) but the TV is still very watchable during peak sun (noonish). Especially compared to other plasma's.- Samsung has resolved pealing issues! Only if you receive an old set might you come across this issue, if you do have this issue, to my knowledge, Samsung will correct the problem.Con's- Buzzing can be noticeable when TV is on mute; however the buzzing is only noticeable in one particular spot, literally only noticeable when you sit in one seat in my living room. After a few weeks of watching the TV, I tuned it out and didn't notice it any more. I believe if I mounted this TV the buzzing would not have been noticeable; in the one seat that I could hear it, if I moved my head 2 feet above, below, or to the side, I couldn't hear the buzzing any more... the frequencies must have been just perfect due to the geometries of my room and the TV that they converged exactly in that area to produce a noticeable buzz (I confirmed this with about 3 different people).- Brightness fluctuations (for lack of a better word). This seemed to happen less after a few weeks of use, but happened most frequently when streaming Netflix (and almost not at all during 3D content). My roommate noticed these fluctuations less than I did, but I noticed almost every fluctuation which is best described as the entire screen brightening slightly, or dimming slightly. THAT SAID, I have since exchanged this TV for an LG PZ550 which does a very similar brightness change, but gradually.. whereas the Samsung which changes in a split second. Both the LG and Samsung brightness changes are very noticeable. (Currently researching to see if LG's brightness fluctuations can be prevented by changing the settings... the Samsung fluctuations can not be stopped by altering TV settings)All that said, I never noticed a brightness fluctuation in game mode... weird.3D - I'm no expert, true 3D content was great. 2D to 3D conversion adds depth to the picture, but you won't see stuff coming out of the screen like some true 3D content. After weeks of use, I found myself rarely using the option.Summary- If you can deal with occasional picture brightness fluctuations, and want to run the risk of hearing a buzz, you will be rewarded with one of the best pictures a plasma TV can offer.Since I have exchanged this TV for the LG PZ550 I can definitely tell difference in picture qualities, with the Samsung being superior. BUT with an extra $500 in my pocket, I'll settle with the LG's glare, and slightly inferior picture.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good So Far, But With a Few Irks", "Author": "Mishima Triad", "ReviewID": "R18CCM6GM01ZXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, so my old Samsung FPT5084 50\" plasma that I got back in 2007 finally crapped out...well the panel went bad, which after talking to the repair company, they told me that they see a lot of plasma panels go bad after 3-4 years especially on Samsung and Panasonic models. Fortunately, the company that I purchased an extended warranty for the tv with off of Amazon was very cool and ended up refunding me for the tv because I guess a new panel was just as or more expensive (I wish that company still sold extended warranties on Amazon). So I did my research and apparently the top model plasmas still are generally agreed to have the best overall picture quality and they are a lot less expensive than LED's that have close to comparable picture quality. This model tv was consistently in the top 5 overall HDTV's on many professional review sites that I read through, so I had narrowed my choice down to either this or the Panasonic GT30 50\" model, but Amazon had a great deal on this one so I got it and after having it set up for a little over 2 weeks now have not been disappointed for the most part.I decided to go with Samsung again not only for the price but also because I absolutely loved the picture quality on my previous Samsung before the panel went bad. After I calibrated it based on several professional calibrations that I found, I'd say that it's picture quality rivaled any current HDTV including this one. So I got this one and first of all upon taking it out of the box was absolutely amazed at how much skinnier and lighter they've been able to make plasma tv's since I got my last one - this one was less than half the weight of my old one (51 lbs vs. 135 lbs). So once I got this one mounted to my entertainment center and started hooking up everything that I had hooked up to my old tv, here's where my major irk comes in and really the whole reason that I gave this tv 4 stars instead of 5. This may not matter to some people; but to me it does because I used all these inputs and my previous Samsung had all of them. First of all, the input specs that Amazon gives for this product are ABSOLUTELY WRONG in one regard - they say that it has 2 component inputs and it only has 1, which if I had checked Samsung's website for the tv information I would have known so I consider this a lack of proper research on my part; but usually Amazon is correct so I didn't bother. However, what really irks me is that even if you check the specs on the Samsung website, the only way you would ever know this is if you went as far as to look at the online instruction manual because even Samsung lies to you about this \"set\" of inputs. If you just look at the specs Samsung lists, it says that it has 1 component input AND 1 composite input; and yes, I still use composite inputs for some of my old gaming devices. So when I first look at the back of the tv I'm like wtf because I didn't see a component or a composite input although I saw little symbols for component inputs over this funny looking little female connector port. So I look in the instruction manual and apparently it came with this little dongle that you plug into that port (don't ask me why the heck they did that instead of just putting the proper ports on the back of the tv because it makes no sense to me). So the dongle has the 3 component video input jacks and stereo audio input jacks...so I'm still like where the heck is the composite input at because I didn't see any s-video or RCA audio/video input jacks. So I look back at the instruction book, read some more and see that the little dongle can be used as a component OR a composite input but not both and am like WTF?! I was really upset at first because on my old receiver composite inputs could not be output through component and I'd never tried on my current receiver since I didn't need to with my old tv. However, fortunately my current receiver can up-convert composite input signals to component output so ultimately I was able to run everything that I needed for both component and composite inputs into my receiver and output through the component from my receiver to the tv. But this still just really irked me that Samsung would basically just straight up lie on the specs on their website. Also, I feel that the inputs are very inconveniently placed compared to my previous Samsung because they are all stuffed into one corner of the tv and some are relatively high up so if you're mounting your tv, then you're going to need some fairly long cables to reach from your devices to your tv. Luckily I was able to rearrange some cables to get everything to reach; but it was a real pain in the butt.So on to the picture quality - after I tried several different professional calibration settings from various websites and found the one I liked the best for my room, distance from tv, general lighting, etc., I have found the picture to be quite good so far...I'd say nearly, if not as good as my previous tv. Contrary to a lot of what I read, I think the picture on my old tv got better after I had \"broken it in\" good and am hoping for the same with this one. Though I saw nothing in the instruction manual about giving this tv a \"break in\" period and in the manual for my previous Samsung plasma, it actually said that you \"don't need to give it a break in period\", I would still suggest doing so for any plasma tv. As with my previous plasma for the first several months, I have gotten image retention from certain things (mostly letterbox bars from watching blu-rays and ESPN score bars); but the built in screen protection tool has gotten rid of it. However, I wouldn't suggest having anything on screen with constant static images for too long until you've put about 150-200 hours into the tv; after that, with my old one at least, it was perfect - never had any burn in or even any image retention after the first 200 hours or so. So anyway, watching blu-rays and HD sports (which is mostly what I watch on tv) has looked great so far. I read some reviews on various sites where some users complained about \"brightness pops\" on this model and so far I have yet to see this occur. I am also aware of the screen peeling issue with a number of these model tv's and will revise my review if this happens to occur to mine since I've only had it running for 2 weeks now. As far as the apps go (which is new to me since not many, if any tv's had apps back when I got my last one), this tv seems to have a fairly good set of apps; however the only one I really plan on using is Netflix. That's kind of nice since I used to do Netflix streaming on my PS3 and now I don't have to wait for it to load up and sign in to PSN to do that. As I read in many reviews, the Smart Hub is a little cluttered; but since all I really plan on using it for is Netflix, that doesn't really bother me. As far as the tv's audio goes, I can't really comment and honestly haven't cared about tv audio since I start using receivers and surround sound back in 1999. I am a little disappointed however because the tv does have an optical digital output that can send 5.1 audio from strictly tv sources. However, the tv is not capable of decoding 5.1 or higher audio from external digital/HD inputs (i.e. HDMI inputs) so you're not going to be able to get 5.1 or better sound from your external digital/HD devices unless you run either your HDMI cable or a separate digital audio output from your external devices. The reason this somewhat irks me with this tv is because now if I plan on watching Netflix on the tv instead of my PS3, I want to run the audio out from the tv to my receiver so I can hear it through my system; but now I need another digital audio cable for my cable box whereas I was hoping I could just run the sound through the HDMI to the tv and it would decode any 5.1 audio and send it through its digital audio output; but unfortunately that's not the case.Sorry for the long review; but I just wanted to be thorough and give as much information to potential buyers as possible. Overall I think this is a good tv so far and as I mentioned before, the only thing that has irked me so far is the inputs as well as it not being able to decode digital audio slightly irking me. I will update my review if anything changes as I continue using it (like screen peeling as I mentioned before).QUICK UPDATE 12/31/11 - I just thought that I'd add another somewhat negative that I've found upon using the tv more that doesn't really change my overall rating; but is annoying nonetheless. Previously, I had not actually viewed anything on Netflix but just logged into my account to make sure it worked on the tv. However, upon actually using it, I have found the interface to be very buggy and laggy - Samsung really needs to put out a patch for this. The Netflix app will crash if you hit certain buttons on the remote that don't function (such as since I have the internal speakers turned off, if I accidentally hit the volume button, it crashes). Also, it's almost pointless trying to fast forward or rewind to where you want because the input command is just horribly laggy. Also, and I assume this is the case with other apps, I don't see any way to change the picture settings in Netflix - it appears to use the default picture settings regardless of what you have the specific input that the tv is currently on set to and won't allow you access the tv's menu at all. This is rather annoying because the default picture settings are so dark; however, I will say that the quality, aside from the darkness, actually looks a lot better for Netflix when watching through the tv as opposed to my PS3. I will update further with anything else I find out.UPDATE 02/01/12 - Well, I decided to update my rating of this tv to 5 stars. Though most of the complaints I originally had still irk me, there are 2 things that have convinced me that it is worthy of 5 stars. First of all, the picture is just absolutely gorgeous. Like I said, I had a hard time believing that this tv would have as good a picture as my previous Samsung plasma, if that good and now it's just wow, it far outshines my last one, which I just really didn't think was possible. I've seen some people complain about brightness pops and even have the gall to say that it's present on ALL Samsung plasmas - well, I can promise you that's not true because I am quite a videophile and I've definitely had my eye out for them since I did read some complaints about this before I purchased the tv and I know for a fact that there have been NONE on my tv and there were NONE on my previous Samsung plasma either. Also, I was pleased to see that the tv got past the image retention stage much more quickly than my previous plasma, which I guess should be expected given that it's 4 years newer; but still pleasing nonetheless. The other thing is that thanks to a very helpful Amazon member, I now finally know how to adjust the picture settings in Netflix, which quite frankly makes no sense and is nowhere to be found in Samsung's documentation or faqs; but nonetheless I finally can use Netflix with an acceptable picture.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV", "Author": "Hammonddave \"Hammonddave\"", "ReviewID": "RU4OFY1DV1FTY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must preface this review by telling you that I am a professional lighting and video content designer, so my light and color sensitivity is pretty accute. I am very picky when it comes to white balance, contrast, and color accuracy. I purchased this television to review high definition video and lighting design, so the video rendition must be extremely accurate. I received my PN64D7000 yesterday and watched it most of the day and evening.  It is by far the best television I have ever owned. Deep rich blacks and a very smooth, natural color balance. The contrast is just amazing!  I have a Sony LCD upstairs in my bedroom and there is absolutely no comparison between the plasma and the LCD.The two guys from the local delivery company carried the huge box into my living room and unwrapped it. They plugged it in to make sure it worked.  I asked them if they could assist me in lifting it up and placing it on its base, but they said that they were forbidden to assist in that way. Being an older gentleman there is absolutely no way I could have done this myself. After a little bit of negotiating they were willing to help out.  It took only about 5 minutes to set it up, but this is definitely a two person job.There is absolutely no buzz, or any sound at all emitting from the Samsung, and no sign of peeling either.  I will closely monitor this as time goes on, but I am hoping that they have solved this issue.The picture looked very good without any tweaking, but I went ahead and dialed in the CNET calibration levels anyway. I must say that the CNET calibration leaves the TV with a slightly green hue, and a warm white balance. I actually prefer the factory, daylight  settings.The only negative comment I could make at this time has to do with the dynamic level control which adjusts the television to the ambient light. It seems to over- adjust, making the screen a little too dim in a dark room. I wish there was a sensitivity control for this,  as the plasma is extremely bright at night. What I did last night was raise the power saving control to medium to darken the screen. There must be an easier way to do this that I have not yet discovered.Speaking of screen brightness, the TV is located in a very bright room with windows on the side and in the rear. The screen is bright enough to compensate for this, plus the real black filter helps keep reflections to a minimum,  I was concerned about this as I heard that plasmas were darker than LCDs. But this set is certainly bright enough to compensate.I briefly tried out the 3d (bought glasses at BrandsMart for $29) and was left unimpressed. But none of the 3d sets really impressed me. More of a gimmick, if you ask me. Call me when the image is a hologram interacting with me in my living room. Funny thing was when my wife came home and asked me if the 3D was on... The picture was so clear that it already looked 3D to her! When something impresses my wife, well, you know that the quality is high.I highly recommend this television.

Things not prominently mentioned in other reviews:- It was hard to distinguish from online pictures what color the brushed metal actually is.  Samsung identifies both this unit and the PN59D8000 with the same words, but pictures clearly show the PN59D8000 to be a light-colored metal. I have had silver TVs before and strongly dislike them; it is distracting to have a light-colored bezel.  Happily, the PN59D7000 is a dark-colored metal.  Looks much classier than the shiny black that is so popular.- I have not found any way to be able to label either the different inputs or the channels.  While they have some pre-defined labels such as using 4 call letters of the station, I have other TVs that let me define that as ABC, CBS, etc.  It is also not all that easy for everyone to remember whether it is HDMI1 or HDMI2 or what other input connection for the blu-ray vs. the DVR vs. the other auxiliary sources.  Small thing, but it keeps it from feeling high-end.- Critics rave about the black blacks of a plasma.  Not sure why that is universally accepted as a good thing.  Sometimes it's like looking at bad wedding pictures -- the groom's head is on the top of a black blob, not able to distinguish details of his suit.  I used a calibration disk, and it improved a little bit, but still darker than I would like.- The buzzing that others mention.  Yes, it's there.  We have a divided household on whether it matters.  It's prominent with no sound, but when the sound is on, the buzzing is overridden or at least diminishes.  Depends how close you sit to the set and how good your hearing is in that frequency range.  We did briefly contemplate returning the set because of it, but decided it's easier just to crank up the sound system!- We didn't think we cared about 3D.  Decided to get glasses and try it anyway.  Wouldn't want to watch much in 3D, but for a change of pace and more intense experience, it is a nice feature.  Strongly depends on 3D content -- some is mildly 3D and some is truly intense -- popping things to the middle of the room.So there are things that keep this from being the perfect set.  Overall, though, I'm happy with the purchase and really can't beat the price.

So far I'm super impressed with everything and have had no problems, this is my second Hi-Def TV & it is HIGH END, not some weak picture overpriced & overhyped LCD LED.  Why are Plasma's better - well the blacks are blacker, the picture is clearer & more accurate, sports & games don't suffer from the motion blur & when your viewing the TV from the side at an angle the picture is way better than LCD - which you have to view head on. This TV comes with a 1 year in home factory warranty - so that's also reassureing.  This TV is ULTRATHIN, 2x thinner than the Panny.  Has 3d which I've only seen some at Best Buy & wasn't impressed.  I'm getting 2 free 3d glasses & have to get a 3d blu-ray - but think 3d is still a minor use thing - that gives some people headaches.I like the square stand the 7 Series 7000s have VS the \"spider\" stand the 8000 Sammys have & this tv has the same display the 8 series has & only one minor difference that make the 8000 not worth any more to me.The pn64d7000 is $1000 more for only 5 more inches; I couldn't see spending $3k for it, $2k was enough.

Based on the source, holy cow! Immersive, great color and accuracy, no halos, no blurring, awesome. Viewing distance of 3d from 12 feet to 20 feet and images still look good.Samsung 2d to 3d conversion actually helps old dvds look richer along with player upconversion.  Blu rays show greater depth but of course don't pop off screen. Effective 600 Mhz speed of plasma really just awesome when watching sports and action, again, no blurring.

For those thinking of purchasing the 64' model, I strongly recommend it.  It is very large but the thin bezel makes the TV look smaller than it really is.  It's also remarkably thin, mounted it sits maybe three inches off of the wall. I almost purchased the 60' but I'm very happy I went with the 64'.In regards to plasma's struggling with brightly lit rooms, it is a problem for many sets, but not this one.

When I got it home, I immediately noticed the problems with the brightness and fast moving images but assumed that was acceptable for this level of TV (which I have found out is not a correct assumption).I would have remained somewhat satisfied, except when watching the Olympics in July 2012, I noticed a single line of pixels was no longer working across the entire picture. It appeared as a black line horizontally across the entire screen. Apparently this has been a very common problem with the small plasmas and you can google and find many reports of it.I immediately called Samsung (glad that I was still under warranty by two weeks), and was told that I would getting a \"replacement\" panel. If you are not familiar with a panel replacement, it is 80% of the electronics of your Samsung plasma to include your screen and all of the main hardware of your TV. The only things that get re-used are peripherary hardware such as power supply, WIFI module, bluetooth module, outside plastic bezel, back cover, stand, etc.So you can imagine my dismay when:a) I had to wait two weeks for a replacement panel to show up, and they could only replace it on a Saturday or I had to wait several more daysb) it was a refurbished panel -- not a new onec) the repair technician had only six months of experience working on TVsd) the repair technician showed up outside of the promised repair windowe) after the replacement panel was powered up -- THE REPLACEMENT WAS DEFECTIVE AS WELL!! This time it was a white vertical line down the screen.So I called Samsung the next day (Sunday) and they said they could not do anything that day. I called back the next day (Monday) and made it clear that going through the whole exercise again was not an acceptable solution for reasons a through e above and asked them to come up with a different solution. They refused (this was even elevated to \"Executive\" service). I asked to speak with a supervisor, and they said the best they could do is have a manager call me back within 24-48 hours. UNACCEPTABLE!!!I just wanted to post this message to give potential samsung customers the other side of the story from an experienced customer. Hopefully it is helpful to you before your purchase.Samsung, if you want to contact me and provide REAL service to resolve this issue, look up ticket #: 510 394 4444UPDATE 08/19/2012:  At this point I have been \"submitted for exchange consideration\". They tell me this means I may qualify for an exchange, but it needs to receive another internal review. They forewarned me that it is likely they will still come back and say they have to try another repair, and even if I receive an exchange it is likely to be a refurbished TV with only a 30 day warranty. I was promised on Tuesday August 14th that somebody would call me in 2-3 business days with a decision. I called on Friday (17th) and they said that it was still being processed and I should hear on Monday (20th). Even this \"exchange review\" is typical of the way I have been treated. They always make you wait several days between each step, you never hear within the timeframe they promise, and you always have to call them (they never call you). Samsung, my TV has been broken for over three weeks and I am still waiting to be treated like a human being. My ticket number has been changed multiple times, now it is 4115883348.UPDATE 08/28/2012:  So it has been over four and a half weeks since I first called in my repair to Samsung -- AND THE GAMES CONTINUE!!! On August 20th, I was finally contacted by somebody in their refunds/exchanges department. He indicated that I had been approved for an exchange, but that the replacement TV would likely come with little or no warranty (he did not know).  At this point, I explained that receiving a part or TV with no warranty was no acceptable given my experience with Samsung TVs, and requested a refund. On Aug 22nd, the refund process \"was started\" and I had to scan and send my receipt. Then, a couple of days later, I am contacted by the same person saying they need my TVs serial number even though I have provided it in the past. The next day they need the 3D glasses serial numbers. I found this very odd that I must return 3D glasses that are not sold with the TV and came as bonus item from the brick and mortar store I bought the TV from.  All of these repeated steps in my opinion are just part of the overall stall tactic. I would guess that one of Samsung's main strategies is to drag the whole process out so long that the people eventually give up.  If you request to speak with a supervisor, they will either completely turn down your request, or they will say that a supervisor will return your call within 24-48 hours (they never do call by the way).SAMSUNG: I WILL NOT GIVE UP!!! I bought a very expensive TV from you and you will make this right!!!I have not heard anything since the 22nd.So I called the refund/exchange department today (Aug 28th), and noone answered my phone calls or emails.

I explained to the agent that I have been through the review twice already and been approved for a refund, and after I explain multiple times he finally agrees and says that I just need to wait to hear back from the refund/exchange department. This he says, is supposed to happen within 3-5 business days, and as he is saying this I remind him that those days have already passed.My most recent ticket number is 4116000306.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "BURN IN --- DO NOT BUY THIS TV", "Author": "Mandyob28", "ReviewID": "R20LKUK5YHLAJG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this TV about a year ago.

I've had this TV for over 2.5 months now and I'm very happy with my purchase. I bought it based primarily on it being picked as Best 2011 TV by CNET and having the highest score/being recommended by Consumer Reports. And of course, based on my own observations at several local big box stores. I weighed all the pros and cons of Plasma vs LED, Passive vs Active 3D, price vs features, name brand vs reliability history, etc... and decided this TV would be the best deal out there. The picture quality, both 2D and 3D, is just awesome. It looks great right out of the box. It has a lot of picture settings, so I didn't even have to customize my own. I suppose if I took the time to adjust the settings to fit my own taste, the picture quality could probably be a little better. However, I don't find that necessary, because the TV has several custom settings that are plenty adequate. Unless you're an extremely critical videophile, there's really no need to mess around with the settings.Now I understand some other reviewers have some concern about the screen peeling and the TV buzzing. In fact CNET also addressed this issue and didn't think it was a problem. Of course, I was a little concerned too when I decided to buy this TV. But after 2.5 months and over 250 hours of use, I'm glad to report no screen peeling issue with my set. The picture quality is still awesome. There is indeed a minor buzz, but it only occurs when the TV detects no signal. Once the signal is received, the buzz goes away. The buzz is extremely minor and is not an issue for me.There was also some concern about playing video games on this TV. I have an Xbox 360. I normally set my TV to Game Mode when playing video games and so far have not experienced any problems. On a couple of occasions, I forgot to set it to Game Mode while playing games and did not notice any problems either.Simply put, this Samsung TV is just awesome. Beautiful design. Awesome picture quality. Very good sound for such a slim design. Both CNET and Consumer Reports got it right on this one. To this day, I'm still amazed at the picture quality of this TV. So, 5 stars from me at this time. If there's any change in the future, I'll update my review accordingly.Now, a few words about the delivery experience. Amazon shipped my TV much sooner than the expected delivery date. So, thumbs up for Amazon. They use Pilot as the delivery company. You need to keep an eye on these guys. They're supposed to unbox the TV and power it up to make sure the TV does turn on (they're not supposed to set it up, just power up). My guys were probably in a rush to make other deliveries and were somewhat careless in their work. One guy dropped a screwdriver on the TV base, causing a minor dent. Fortunately, it was on the rear side, so it was not visible when viewing the TV from the front. But still, I now know the dent is there. After causing the dent, this guy is still holding the screwdriver and waving it inches from the TV screen as he tried to remove all the packaging materials. By this time, I was already a little upset and had to remind him to be careful with his screwdriver. I could have refused the delivery because of the dent, but in the end decided to be a nice guy and accepted it anyway.

No issues at all for me.  I do recommend that you look up recommended settings for the picture options online, as I really didn't like the 4 or 5 default settings (Dynamic, Normal, etc.) - Some were drab, others cartoonish.  But once I configured with settings I pulled up online, it looked great.  Lots of settings & takes some time, but worth it.TV comes as two separate pieces - the base, and the flat panel.  Very odd that you essentially slide the panel onto the base, as it doesn't look of feel very sturdy, but works fine and nothing concerning.  The positive with this is that it allows the TV to swivel a good deal, which is great for where I have it placed.

I waited a long time to write the review to be sure I would be completely accurate.Disappointed does not even start to explain how I feel. Extremely upset, angered and ripped off are a bit closer.There is one problem that has completely ruined this TV for me. This problem is the constant brightness fluctuation. I read about it in a few reviews but it seems most people did not notice it or have a TV that does not do this. Unfortunately I do notice this and have a $2,500 TV that does this constantly. Once you notice it you will not be able to enjoy a movie or game again.What the TV does: in every scene the TV tries to adjust the darkness of the picture to best fit the scene. Doesn't sound so bad right? Problem is that it changes the brightness like 2-5 times in each scene. This is extremely noticeable in scenes with lots of dark colors in the background. Also the lighter brightness it switches to makes the picture look like 10 times worse! I have tried all the updates and even customizing all the setting and nothing will stop this problem from happening.If you do buy this TV buy it from Amazon since they have an excellent return policy. I bought mine from Electronic Expo and between the return policy being a pain and the fact that I am a single guy who lives alone and can not repackage a TV of this size I did not return it in time.Bottom line: buy any TV besides this one! You will be disappointed and feel ripped off. Maybe you get lucky and get a set that does not have this problem. But is that gamble worth it? It certainly is not to me.

Color and depth are also amazing. Looks better in my home than when it was on display in the store. Blu-Rays discs look incredible. Regular TV service looks great too. (i have a FIber Optic Service provider)(see CAPS).I don't use the 3-D that much because it bothers my eyes but my nieces and nephews like it. I find that the lenses are too small and allow for too much peripheral light to get in. 3D is best viewed in darkness because of this. It may not bother others as much as it bothers me.I was concerned with the TV being in a bright room but it is a non-issue; I almost bought a LED because of this. I'm glad I went plasma because I never liked the \"smooth motion\" you see on the LED TV's and turning it off diminished picture quality. My brother-in-law had bought a Samsung 6000 series LED and I compared it with this one for a few weeks before I bought this one.I've seen a lot of reviews that knock the quality of the speakers but I think they are more than adequate. I only use my surround sound when watching a blu-ray movie and some sports.My only disappointment with this TV is the smart tv interface,  It runs fairly slow. Trying to stream anything of high quality through the you-tube app is impossible. I'm sure its not my internet service because the speed I get is great. I hardwired the TV directly to my router.

What a difference a couple of years make! While the picture quality on the old TV was good, this TV has noticeably deeper blacks and very vibrant colors. I am a purist so it's got to be plasma for me in my main TV room. From a size perspective, the exterior dimensions of this TV are only about 1\" wider and taller than my old 58\", but the bezels are so small now that you can fit much more screen in a smaller package. The reduction of one piece of glass also makes this TV nearly 80-90 lbs lighter than my old 58\". It's ridiculously thin, too, for a TV it's size. It's actually thinner than the mount. I can't really imagine how you could make a TV this size much thinner. For anyone who is looking to calibrate it (and you should) go check out CNET's calibration page. It will get you setup very nicely. I also really like the dark brushed aluminum that this TV is wrapped in. Very attractive in almost any setting. Do yourself a favor and skip the 8000 model and pick this one up. It's the same TV as far as I can tell and all you lose is the touchscreen remote. Well worth the savings since most people with TVs like this will have a programmable (e.g. Harmony) remote or the like.With regard to some of the other reviews, I haven't run into any of the screen peeling issues so I am hopeful that the issue is resolved. The one issue I have is that when the house is colder and the TV heats up, it makes a lot of cracking and popping noises, which I believe are due to thermal expansion. This may be inescapable, but it is a bit annoying. That's my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.

I just wanted to write a review for the people that are still on the look out for this plasma.First of all let me start off by saying that i placed the order on Feb.08(weds) and was suppose to receive the tv on Feb. 15(thurs.). Well lucky me the delivery company Ceva called me on a Monday 12 two days early! Woh was i Happy!!! This Pn51d7000 plasma is my first big screen. And my first plasma!! (I'm comming from a Lcd 32'' Samsung a touch of color 720P tv) And I love it!!! I was scared at first because of the screen burn in and the buzzing i kept reading about on other forums. Well I tried my best to run the tv as much a possible to speed up the process on the aging. Iv'e seen temp. image retention when i watched blu-rays with the black bars. But as soon as I run regular(Full screen) tv it  goes away within several mins. or so. I Noticed as the tv aged the retention has minimized. I still get a little when i watch the movies with the black bars but im not scared any more that it won't go away. But i am still on guard all the time about me falling asleep with it on. Eeesh you never know! I personally think that if your not very cautious with things and don't like to baby things.. this tv isn't for you. This plasma tv isn't as sensitive as they use to be but image burn in is always around the corner if your not careful. Like i said i'm coming from an Lcd tv in which i used it like crazy as a computer monitor and continuously fell asleep and would leave the tv with still images and never did i have a prob. with burn in. So it's taking some time to get used to, but I love the big images and beautiful and very accurate colors on this plasma! :) So i'm good with it but i don't think this tv is for everybody.. well plasmas in general. Oh and before i forget!! I don't get any buzzing at all!!! I like to believe that i have excellent hearing and will notice the slightest of sounds and I have not heard a peep from this tv. Well the only time i heard anything was the first time it was turned on. Because the tv was coming from a colder environment and is common for you to hear the poppings when you turn it on. I live in the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas so were not that far above sea level to cause any extra pressure on the plasma.(That's usually the cause of the buzzing in plasmas). Other than that i don't think there are any negatives besides the temp image retention. This tv up to now has preformed at perfect performance(IT is now March 14, thirty days or so after) Actually now that i'm thinking about the tv i am absolutely happy with the tv! All the picture calibrations that you can do(Leave it to Samsung) with this tv and you can save each one for each output( Such as when you use HDMI or antenna ect.) There is so much that comes with this tv that I don't think that i will be able to fit it all in this review. One thing I have tried on this tv is the 3D. I purchased ''Cloudy with a chance of meatballs'' and WOW!! It is awesome!!! I showed it to my girl friend who at the time had never seen the new 3D(Oh by the way we used the Samsung 3050GB glasses which worked awesome!) and absolutely loved it!!! 3D is considered gimmicky at the moment because there isn't a lot of content but if there was I seriously believe it would be an awesome experience for everybody! If done right, like with this Samsung pnd7000!!! :) Other features such as the internet and apps worked well but a little sluggish. No where near what a computer can do. I mean it's a cool feature to have but I rarely use it. It's to slow for my patience lol . Before i end this review i would like to apologize for the sloppy review. I was all over the place and didn't write my paragraphs right lol. But i was feeling lazy and just wanted to have my review for others to know more about this tv and to help them decide when the the time comes to make that purchase!!! :) Well i will be updating in a month or so on how my tv is going. hopefully it is still running with out a prob. ;) I am pretty confident that it will. The feel of the tv helps me know that i didn't buy some cheapy at Wal-mart lol ( Not that there isn't any thing wrong with that lol) So good luck on your decision making and if your in the look out for a plasma i highly recommend this one. ;) The picture quality will leave you in aw[...] :) PEACE!!!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy I pulled the trigger - Now let's watch TV!", "Author": "TrueFeedback", "ReviewID": "R15E8EH4IK98YQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "How I bought my Samsung TV this winter:Read reviews and re-read reviews.

I dont leave the house much to go to the movies... so I cant tell how it looks on the movie theater, however I went to an IMAX 3D movie (Tron legacy) and I can tell you the 3d its pretty much like the theater, of course the screen its not nearly as big :) but the 3D feel its great and the picture quality remains when in 3D. I read some stuff about how the images from one eye pass to the other and how this is a regular problem with 3D tv. with this TV it does happen from time to time and well you will see a strange kinda like a shadow around the object or person but its not bad at all and it doesnt happen all the time.4... smart hub.. The Smart Hub as an idea its functional, and looks good. you can have access to netflix, youtube, stuff like that but trust me... its slow... it actually feels like an atom processor PC when navigating if you know what I mean.5... Ports... there are a bunch.. 4 HDMI, 2 USB, a composite etc.. no comments there...6... using your own media... when you have a bunch of 3D sources all over the net you kinda wonder if you could use your TV directly for this.. the answer its yes... it plays a bunch of file formats, however when using a USB drive if you have many files.. again .. it can be slow.other thoughts... When I got this I went right to the Smart hub and tried the youtube app.. it didnt work.. and I was pissed off.. however... I found that you need to keep your set updated. It has a update online function which I used.. and it told me that my set was up to date.. so I was pissed, however I did a little reading and found that in the samsung site you can download the system update which works (requires a USB drive) .. follow easy instructions.. and I was all set.. youtube, netflix, hulu... all working great :)I can tell you this... you will not be disappointed by this TV. And if you are a budget limited person.. dont be afraid of the PLASMA.. its just great :)Cheers", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing 3D", "Author": "Harry A.

I ended up ordering and returning two of this model, built in different months (July and August 2011), due to each having the problems identified below.Pros:* Good price compared with Panasonic competition.  I don't consider LG to be a competitor as their picture quality isn't as good.* Slim design and relatively lightweight (~75 lbs) making mounting and moving easier.Cons:* Both of the TVs I had buzzed.  The buzz was quite loud and directional in front of the screen.  No buzz off to sides, but who doesn't want to be able to watch TV from directly in front of it?  The buzzing was very distracting in any quiet scenes and still audible underneath louder ones.* Brightness \"pops\".  The dynamic brightness or contrast on this TV has bugs where in a dark scene the brightness will momentarily \"pop\", then fade back over a few seconds.  This happens multiple times a minute.  It is _extremely_ distracting once you've noticed it.* Lackluster remote.If you really feel you must order this TV, be sure you can return it if (or when) it buzzes.

I first bought a 55\" LED, returned it due to small size and then bought this 64\" beast because it was the best priced 64\". I must say the picture quality is awesome and I like it better than the LED.b. This was rated by CNET as the best TV of 2011, and I really respect their reviews.Now onto the TV:a. It comes in a huge box, so make sure you go with a minivan or a truck. Don't tilt your plasma more than 30degrees while transporting.b. Once out, the setup is fairly easy, like any other TV now a days. When I powered it on, it guided me to preferred settings and network connection and immediately updated the smart hub.c. The best part is when I power on my laptops/ PCs, they automatically show up at the TV (as an AllShare device)and I can see pics/ videos, music etc directly on the TV. Great feature, but can a little annoying sometimes when you watch a show and a small pop-up comes on the bottom right when someone in the other room opened a laptop.d. I have still not been able to be a big fan of SmartHub, except probably for youtube and netflix.e. I do have a Samsung tablet and get to use the Android Samsung remote control app, which is really nice and fulfills my need for a QWERTY remote.Cons:a. I wish this had a browser like the D8000.Summary: We are really loving this TV. I bought all accessories from monoprice including my mount....you can tell I am value conscious. If you are debating between the 8000 and 7000 plasmas, please know that D8000 has a QWERTY remote, a web browser and a true black filter as the only differences.

After moving into our new place our 50 in Pioneer Kuro was getting a bit long in a tooth. I had budget issues when I bought the Pio 4 years ago so had to stick with 720p. That and our old setup had be back around 10 feet which made 1080p TV no longer needed. Now we were in the new house with a new setup we are sitting about 8 feet away. Yea I know Kuro still has an awesome picture but I am still trying to justify the upgrade :)I got this TV for a few reasons. The reviews I read about this tv and the simular models were all excellent. I followed the thread over on the AVS forums to get more insight and listen to peoples feedback. The features also seemed to me to help seal the deal as I could now get netflix and Pandora steaming in my TV vrs an extra dedicated box. I looked hard at the 8000 but I was not sure if the value for me was there to justify the price and hated the stand it used (I use an harmony remote so the better remote on the 8000 was a non-factor). So at the end of the day the 7000 model seem to be the best TV to fit my needs/wants.And after playing with it wow it was. Going from 50 to 64 was a major increase of course. But the TV so far has been excellent. The colors and IQ of the TV are very close to the Kuro. Once I have it running for a bit more I want to get it professionally calibrated. The blu-rays look amazing on the TV. The stream services are pretty good as well. The Samsung apps are pretty good as well. I have not tried 3D but thats low priortiy as we wanted the TV for its 2D abilities and so far its not disappointing.Still there are some minor things that could be done better. The stand on the 7000 is flimy as the tv will wobble if touched. That alone makes me almost want to mount it. I had to download the Samsung Remote App on the Android Market as is it took forever to try to log on Netflix, Pandora, twitter, ect taping out my username/password. There also are reports of a pealing of the antiglare filter which so far (crossing fingers) have not happened to me. Also there is a feature that will try to adjust brightness which can lead to image changes in dark to light scene. I hear Samsung is working on a Firmware fix to correct this or at least make it optional.Other than those minor things the TV is great. We have had it for two weeks and loving it. The price, look (its very thin) and the great service as it showed up in about 6 days after we ordered it, has made this to be a very enjoyable experience.

All of 2011 Samsung 'D' series plasma TVs suffer from fluctuating brightness. At random times the brightness of the TV will instantly jump much higher then it normally is and then it will come back down again to normal. This is very distracting and how often it happens varies. It may only happen a few times a movie or it could happen several times a movie. When it does happen the screen could become so bright in my dark room it would hurt my eyes. This is very annoying, extremely distracting and it takes all of the fun and enjoyment out of watching and owning this 3D TV. This is a well documented problem with these TVs if you look in all the right places.However Samsung seems unwilling or just out right refusing to acknowledge this problem even exists. If you call customer support they will tell you to turn off one of many options in the TV's menus, set certain picture control options to a different value, or to reset the TV with a code entered via the remote control among other things. However none of this will work and your TVs brightness will still bounce all over the place. Samsung is trying to blame the customer for a fault of their product by telling them if is a problem with their personal TV settings.IF Samsung fixes this problem some day then this will be a great TV that I would be proud of owning. When the TV isn't becoming so bright it makes my eyes bleed it does have wonderful picture quality that is some of the very best I have ever seen. My first set died on me within my return window, if the second TV has this issues I will be returning it for a full refund as others have already done.I can not justify this purchase until this problem is fixed.

I was looking for an upgrade to my 4 year, 32 inch Sharp LCD. I own both an XBOX 360 and PS3 which get allot of use. My wife and I also watch a few TV shows and if nothing else is going on I usually have it tuned to one of the HD channels as I do other things. In other words, it's on all the time and actively used quite frequently.Pros - I went with the 59 inch which is almost twice the size of my previous TV. The picture is crystal clear and vibrant. So far I've been playing Halo 4 and Skyrim and they look fantastic. My HD channels also come in beautifully. Being a SMART TV it comes with an impressive set of features. Honestly I'll probably not use most of them since my PC is in the same room but I enjoy having them. I was also impressed with the built in audio although I do have a surround sound system so I won't be using that much, if at all.Cons - The buzzing! I knew from my research that plasma's can buzz and that this model was no different. However, some people claimed their set was dead quiet while others said they could only hear it if way up close. I figured this wasn't going to be an issue. When I first set it up I heard no buzzing and thought I had struck gold. Turns out that while plugging it in and messing with the settings I hadn't had a chance to sit down in front of it and when I did was I in for a surprise. The TV is not hung on the wall yet (will be once the basement is finished) so it stands at eye level of anyone sitting on the couch. The buzzing you can hear is quite loud and distracting. It's very directional and seems to shoot out straight from the middle of the screen from end to end. If you stand up or move your head down 12-15 inches the buzzing stops completely. Same deal if you move to either side past the frame. It was so bad I had to find a solution so I propped the TV up about 20 inches with a sturdy plastic bin filled with stacked books for extra support. Now my wife and I can sit on the couch and not be assaulted by the terrible buzzing. When this gets moved to the basement it will be hung on the wall at around the same height so it should not be an issue then either.In conclusion, if it weren't for the buzzing I would have easily given this 5 stars. Even knowing about it beforehand I was caught off guard by how bad it was. I considered returning it and going for one of their LED models but sending this back would be such a huge hassle and with my most recent set up the buzzing isn't a problem anymore. If you are are considering this model I suggest making sure the bottom of the TV is set to eye level to avoid any buzzing. If this is not an option I would look into LCD/LED.Update 12/7/12After going through some of the trouble shooting tips listed on the Samsung website I've come to the conclusion that the buzzing is way louder then it should be. I have opened a service request and should have someone down on 12/12 to take a look at it.Update 12/26/12Technician came to the house, did some measurements and sent them to Samsung for analysis. Instead of being contacted I had to call back which was somewhat irritating. Then I was told Samsung deemed the buzzing to be within specification. So a buzzing sound that is so loud it prevents anyone from comfortably sitting in front of the set is normal. I find this absurd. As such I will change my rating from 4 to 3 stars and simply cannot recommend this TV to anyone. I'll never buy another plasma again.

Unbox, put on stand, plug in HDMI components and power, turn on. After setting up networking, it downloaded a software update, applied it, and rebooted the TV (who knew we'd be talking about rebooting our televisions?) at which point everything came up and everything \"just worked\"Samsung's SmartTV \"app store\" is gimmicky and I can't see ever using it beyond the one free application worth using: Netflix. The Netflix client UI is very similar if not identical to the one on my Boxee Box. Wireless network setup on the set was painless, and it works great. The iPhone remote control application rarely ever works, but when it does it's somewhat useful - though since the input is via HDMI and not direct cable, changing channels is a bit useless. Makes for a good way to remotely shut it off, I suppose, though once you turn it off via the iPhone app...there's no way to turn it back on!Most surprisingly is the quality of the built-in speakers. Complimenting integrated speakers probably gets me a spot on most audiophile's hit-list, but seriously - as I wait for the rest of the system to arrive, the sound provided by the television is quite adequate and fills the room. Deep bass and high fidelity they are not, but they're far from what you'd generally expect with built-ins.I am not seeing any brightness pops, and will definitely keep an eye out for peeling. This particular unit was a recent manufacture, so perhaps the two most common issues discussed here in various reviews have been addressed.I would absolutely buy this TV again.PROS: Easy setup, dark as night blacks, excellent picture quality, good input selection, quite passable audio.CONS: Text entry methods change.

I'm always on netflix and the included app handles it very well via my wireless modem which is (in relation to the tv location) upstairs and on the opposite side of the house. This TV had great reviews except for the issues with the anti-glare film on the screen which people complained would peal away. i rolled the dice and bought the tv anyway. when it arrived, the first thing i looked for was pealing and it did have a portion that was roughly the size and shape of an orange slice along the top of the screen. no one had describe in detail what the coating was like in other reviews so i was happy to see it was kind of like the protective cover you put on an iPhone for scratch resistance. i got a squeegee (for placing bondo on a car for body repair) from my garage, covered it with the screen wiping cloth provided by Samsung and slowly worked all the air out from between the coating and the glass screen. it worked like a charm and you can't tell there was any pealing at all. the fact that i had to do this is the only reason i didn't rate the tv with 5 stars.Everything else has been pretty great. we just watched the last Harry Potter movie on it which is a pretty dark movie so we got to experience the deep dark blacks unique to plasma tv's. and it was certainly dark. i actually had to crank up the brightness to see the caricatures definition in the very dark scenes. after the movie i tuned the brightness for average tv watching and it's been great for all other movies as well.the anti-glare works really well. there is window directly across the room from the tv that reflects off the tv which is especial noticeable in the early evening but the anti glare keeps it to a minimum which is all i could ask. the unlimited viewing angle is totally awesome when you have a house full of guests pilled around the tv. There is no ARC hook up for hooking it to external speakers but there is an optical out for that and it sounds great on my stereo system.If i had one other complaint (other than the pealing) it would be that it seems to take an excessive amount of time to activate the Smart HUB feature that gives you access to the apps. there is also an annoying delay imputing letters using the standard remote control. you do this to sign into accounts like youtube or to search for movies on netflix. ive heard there is an app for smart phones to do this typing easier so i'll have to look into it.Overall this is the best TV i've ever owned and i absolutely love the thing!!

Haven't noticed either problem. I have a October 2011 build and it looks like both issues have been taken care of. Got it from Amazon and was shipped via CERV. Great service! It actually came a day early which is awesome with an item such as this. I would buy it again if given the choice. Haven't tried 3D yet, just need the glasses which I will get this week. Will update this review when I try out 3D games and movies on my PS3 with this TV.Update: Does have brightness pops! Doesn't happen on all video sources but it does happen. Have never noticed it when playing games on my PS3 which is kinda odd??? It seems to happen more in dark scenes, on close up shots with faces, and some fast changing scenes. It is a slight black level change on the overall picture that's not always noticable. I have a DVR and when it happens I go back a few seconds to see it if happens again and it does. Very odd that I've never noticed it on commercials??? Not a fan about the brightness pops...could see how some people would dislike this plasma for that reason. Also, does have directional buzzing. If your more than a couple of feet away from the plasma this isn't an issue as you can't hear the buzzing. The \"pops\" are a 50/50 thing that won't bother you or your gonna really hate it! If they fix this with a firmware update I would rate this plasma 5 stars again. They really need to address this issue as we are buying something to look at for hours on end and pretty much everyday. It's like buying a Ferrai with a bent in the door. It's still sexy to look at even with the dent. Only the dent doesn't just appear and disappear like the \"pops\" does. Your not gonna see it all the time but you know it's there.  I must say that I still love this plasma as the picture quality is outstanding and I've owned over 10 high end hdtv's since 2001. Would I recommend it? It's hard to recommend something that has know issues even though I still love it with the known issues.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best TV I have ever owned...", "Author": "Ryan A. Inman", "ReviewID": "R1LUX5WZJICZEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this television around the end of June and now that I have had it for over 90 days I figured it was about time I chimed in. First of all, even out of the box the picture quality was absolutely stunning. I was also pleasantly surprised by how much more aesthetically pleasing the set itself was even when turned off. It is certainly eye candy. The only complaint I have out of the box is that attaching the stand was kind of a pain in the neck, but once you get it on, it stays on.Now, before I go any further I do want to point out that I immediately hooked the TV up to my 7.1 surround sound system and have therefore never heard the default sound of the set. I would imagine that anyone that would shell out the amount of money for a TV this expensive would have a sound system of their own as well, so no big deal.As I said, the picture quality out of the box was very impressive, but after I had it professionally calibrated it was downright mind blowing. I had never seen a TV with such outstanding black levels and colors. Every single person that has been over to my house since I have had it has payed nothing but compliments as the TV is certainly a crowd pleaser.I also can't comment on the 3D performance of the set since I have never used the feature and probably never will. I'm just not a fan of that particular technology.This set does not suffer from the screen peeling issue that some Samsung displays have been burdened with either.

It appeared the first time we turned on the TV, so I chalked it up to the \"plasmas need to warm up\" theory.  It went away after about an hour - problem solved, or so I thought.A week later, after having been away and not used the TV for 2 days, the strip re-appeared and stayed for a couple of hours.  At this point I did some testing to confirm that it wasnt the cables, the source, etc.  I assumed that the \"not in use\" and the strip were somehow correlated, and phoned Vann's. They were extremely nice, and said that I could return it no questions asked, but also understood the pain in the a** that un-mounting a TV is.  I decided to give it another go, thinking that perhaps the plasma needed a longer viewing period to warm \"all the way up\" as instructed by Samsung.  I knew this was likely BS, but didnt want to return the TV, because when it was working the picture is unreal.The third time it happened, again after a day or two of not watching, the strip reappeared and stayed for about 36 hours.  So it was return time.  Called Vann's, got it all set up and waited for the local shipping company - Home Direct.  This was where it all broke down.  Somehow the local company had lost my phone number and email (despite originally emailing and calling me for delivery).  I continued to call Vann's who apologized profusely for the inconvenience.  They decided to ship me out a new one the same day that the return was picked up, a process that normally takes two weeks.  Hopefully the new TV will NOT have the same problem.

I saw that the 7000 & 8000 had special filters to reduce reflections, and my interest was piqued.I finally got the green light from my wife to make the purchase for my birthday (back in June)and immediately started looking at the reviews of the latest models.  The Panasonic TC-PVT30 series and the Vizio XVT3SV series were both highly reviewed and I had been looking at those for awhile.  The PN59D8000 review came out shortly after I started looking, and they mentioned that the high marks on the quality of that model would also apply to the PN59D7000.  I decided this would be the best of both worlds: the higher quality of plasma with the increased brightroom performance.  The price was right in the middle of both as well.I decided to purchase on Amazon without viewing the TV in the store since I've always heard that the calibration is very different, and store performance is not a good indicator of in-home performance.  *There is a store setting, during setup.The glare is noticable while the TV is off, but goes away for the most part once you turn it on.  I did have an issue when my wife wanted to re-arrange the living room to where our 3 large living room windows were directly across from the TV instead of to the side.  At that point, the glare was VERY bad during the day, even with the blinds closed.  We ended up using it as an excuse to finally get curtains and the problem was solved.  The remaining light was easily taken care of by the TV's filter.I fully calibrated the TV to the 8000 settings originally & the TV color looked a little off (7000 calibration wasn't out yet).  After digging a little more, I read a suggestion to wait to calibrate until the TV had broken in.  I returned it to the default setings and waited a month.  By then, the 7000 calibrations were out and cnet had reviewed the 7000 claiming it was the best value available.  I had liked the default settings, but could tell they weren't perfect.  Once I used the cnet calibration, the TV was exactly on the money.I highly recommend this TV for anyone's home theater or living room.

Turns out that the stations that I watch have \"bugs\" and ID \"banners\" up for every show and they are now ghosted into my screen. I called Samsung for some support, and guess what? Burn-in is NOT covered under their warranty. Even if it happens that quickly. I was at a loss. I explained to them that this was not acceptable, but they held fast. I told them that by omitting burn-in from their warranty, they were in fact ADMITTING that it was a problem that they expected to happen. Otherwise, they would stand behind their product. They then suggested that to avoid burn-in, I should watch different channels throughout the day.  Seriously, this was their solution.

SO, I love this TV.NOW, the real reason for this review [give Kristyn a raise]:My 27 month old son, Jack, whom I love dearly [and he is still ambulatory because of that fact] apparently thought my brand new 64\" plasma 3D TV - that I love dearly - was a golf swing analysis monitor.  While there were no witnesses to his practice session, apparently, his aim is accurate.  I know this because I when I turned the tv on later in the day I was greated with a 6\" wide vertical white stripe and a 6\" horizontal black stripe both of which ran the entire length of the screen and at whose intersection was a black impression about the size of an old 4 wood that he was seen carrying earlier that day.I made the obligatory call to Samsung customer service and they had the local repair firm call me the next day with a quote of $1,954 for parts and labor.  I paid just over $2,100 for this beautiful TV less than 2 months earlier, so I was faced with having a $4,000 Samsung 64\" 3D TV right after having to pay Christmas bills.  I was \"bummed-out\" to say the least.  But, I still love Jack, I keep telling myself.While I'm not poor, I just can't afford $1,950.  So, I called Samsung customer service and acknowledged they had zero liability in this, didn't owe me anything, there was no warranty issue here, and it was my fault 100%.  BUT, I added, \"Please!! please!! pleaseeeeeee, can you do ANYTHING to help me???\"  The responses were polite and consistent:  No. Not a warrenty issue.

Yes, I have had the TV professionally calibrated by the way.The picture is fine but there is no contest whatsoever with the Samsung LCD televisions.  The Samsung LCD's are magnificent.

I paid over 3000.00 for an older lnt52\" and tv failed at just over 13 months. Samsung customer service would not repair the tv even though it was a known issue at the time (panel bond problem)...even the local tv repair shop told me that these tv's are mostly junk and he see's them ALL THE TIME! So, the 3000.00 tv sits up stairs unplugged. Disgusting.Best advice I could give you is to make sure to purchase a plasma and get the extended service....but do not buy it from Samsung.Samsung....I have kept my promise to you when I told your phone reps that you have lost a customer for life! I have since bought an LG front load washer and dryer (would have been Samsung)...then the neighbor bought the LG washer and dryer on my recommendation...multiple LG tv's for parents and family....and the LG plasma that I am about to buy for my parents.
