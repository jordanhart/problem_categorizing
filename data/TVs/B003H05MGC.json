{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wish I could afford to buy another one!", "Author": "Eric Poston", "ReviewID": "R3K4ZKEAARG7GP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this on Memorial Day at a local store - price was a little cheaper than Amazon, plus no shipping cost, so we got a great deal.  First off, the packaging for this TV is HUGE - the only way we could have put this in our van would have been to lay the third row seats down AND take out one of the 2nd row seats, as the box is too wide to fit in the aisle between them.  Luckily we have a truck and had no problems fitting in it.  If you plan to put this TV in a cabinet/entertainment center, you'd better buy a big one.  Due to the shape of the frame, which includes the speakers on either side, this TV is wider than a typical 55\" - it measures about 55 1/2\" at its widest point, so is too wide for most cabinets that say they will fit a 55\" TV.  Wall mounting or mounting on an open table setup would be no problem.  OK, enough about the size of this monster - you get the picture :)Setup was a snap - got it out of the box, hooked up a Toshiba DVD recorder/VCR combo via HDMI and a standard def DirecTV DVR to the composite A/V (no HD DVR yet).  On a HD signal, this TV has an incredible picture - bright image, great blacks (some TVs have problems with dark/night scenes, but this one handles them wonderfully).  Standard-def images (480i) can be grainy, but that's simply a factor of size vs. resolution and is only really noticed if you're close to the screen.  Viewing from across our family room (about 12' from tv to couch) is fine.  We also connected an antenna to pull in over-the-air signals.  The tuner is pretty good, and picked up all the UHF networks in our area, about 30 miles away.  The local CBS affiliate broadcasts on a VHF frequency and we can't pick it up - but we can't get it on any of our TVs, so I can't say this tv is any better or worse in that regard.Connection to our wireless network was quick and easy, and streaming from Netflix, Vudu and Amazon works great.  I haven't tried any of the other services available, but there are plenty to choose from.  The Netflix software on this TV is better than on the LG blu-ray player we have connected to another TV - this one will allow you to find movies that aren't in your instant queue, while the LG will ONLY play items in your queue, so that's a bonus.  Vudu plays well in SD or 720 format, but frequently pauses in 1080p - we need a faster internet connection to support full HD downloads.  DivX movies downloaded in full 1080p look fantastic when played from the Toshiba player over HDMI.This TV comes with a remote that connects to the TV via Bluetooth. It remembers which equipment is connected to the various inputs, and automatically changes the controls to match the input equipment - really nice!  I found that it will control all my equipment, and since it works via bluetooth, you don't have to have direct line-of-sight to the TV. Wish that the bluetooth part worked for my satellite equipement too!  Programmable remotes will operate this TV, but depending on how old they are, they may not be able to hit all the features of the tv - our older directv remotes will operate the basic features, but only the newer models will change the input source - so you may want to use the remote that came with the TV.  We have smaller kids, and wanted to limit their use of the tv remote, because it has a slide-out keyboard similar to those on some cell phones to make posting to facebook (one of the apps that comes on the tv) easy.  Since our youngest is 5, we thought it might be best to keep that remote out of harm's way.All in all, this is a fabulous TV for the money - it's an LED for less than many LCDs of smaller size.  I was considering the new Sharp LED with the 4th 'yellow' pixel, but after seeing it in person, couldn't justify paying nearly 50% more for a smaller (52\") screen.  The LED runs mucher cooler than plasma - while shopping for TVs we walked through a local Sears store, and you could feel the heat radiating off the plasma screens - that alone steered us away from plasma.  LED seemed too high until we found this Vizio - we'd gotten a 32\" Vizio with 1080p capability for our bedroom at Christmas, so knew that the Vizio had the quality of the bigger names, but without the price premium of Sony, Samsung or LG.  When we get ready to replace our other tube TVs, we'll be looking at the Vizio M-series as our top choice - just in a smaller size!", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superior quality for excellent price", "Author": "K. Wolf", "ReviewID": "R2GND3YFZCOCJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a fan of Vizio for years now and this TV has reinforced my belief that Vizio is the best TV for your money.  I actually believe that Vizio produces some of the best televisions regardless of price.I've had this particular model for over a week now and can tell you the picture and audio are phenomenal.  The standard def picture on this television blows away the quality of my last 47in Vizio.  That was the only draw back with Vizio that I've had in the past (the standard def picture quality).Everything on this model is easy to setup, including Wi-fi.  The remote was a great idea and well designed and the apps run smoothly.  I expected them to startup and react somewhat slowly while I was watching programs but the apps will run without any hang-ups.  The apps were a pleasant plus to this already amazing television.Bottom line:  The picture is amazing with settings that make it easy to customize the picture.  The audio is outstanding with great built-in features that aren't featured on most other TV models.  All of this with a price that can't be beat.If you buy it, you will not be disappointed or end up second guessing your choice.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overall Great for the Price", "Author": "FamilyManJason", "ReviewID": "R1PK3037R6YT6E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We Purchased this television to replace a Vizio Plasma television and have been impressed by the BETTER PICTURE.  I keep this television in a room with 6 recessed lights and 4 large windows producing tremendous glare and the picture clarity/brightness is still good.  The remote and television operation is easy and intuitive.  My DVD player works well on HDMI connection but I have issues with the composite AV connection creating a background humming noise when connected to our Directv receiver.  Even after buying a new Composite cable, the sound returned but corrected when I attached my Directv to the antenna/DTV connector instead.  I cannot figure out if the problem is with the television or the cables or the Directv receiver (it is not HD).  I suspect that if I had a HD receiver and used a HDMI connection the problem would be solved.My family primarily watches DVD and television, so I cannot speak for Blu Ray or HDTV function.  I can say, though, that digital standard television looks great off the satellite and DVD is wonderful.I notice there is a speaker on the back of the television as well as speakers on each side.  The television sound is ok and may be better if not mounted on wall (as mine is), but sounds a little muffled and much improved with a surround sound system.The internet connected well, but I have not tested Netflix or any other streaming yet, since I have no accounts and have not ever used them.  I will add this evaluation after I try them out.7/27/10 UPDATEWe have streamed using Netflix.  It connects within 2 minutes.  Every so often the wireless streaming has some pauses, but my internet connection and older router are contributing to the problem.  Overall, we are pleased with how easy the television was to set up.", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very nice 55\" LED HDTV", "Author": "Wolf Britz", "ReviewID": "R3ILY1QTJJP8AT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We Purchased this television to replace a 55\" projection TV that finally quit. This television is in a room with several wall lamps and although there is some glare, after a few minutes you really no longer notice it, actually the tv it replaced was worse. The remote and television operation is easy. Our Sony Blue Ray works well on HDMI 2. We have 2 Wii's and have them connected to the COMPonent input and the AV input. We have our HD cable box connected to HDMI 1. The HD from the cable box is awsome!Power consumption seems to be about 70 to 95 watts when on and reads next to nothing when in standby. Our 42\" plasma uses about 330 watts, OUCH.We bought this TV because after researching the PIP (picture in picture) options we thought this set would do PIP from AV and COMP at the same time. WRONG, the manual is wrong, you can do PIP using one digital and one analog only. I was disapointed with this, but I found an adapter for the wii that changes the output to HDMI, so that problem is solved. I have not found any TV that will do PIP for both my wii's at the same time.My wife thought the audio was o.k., but I didn't like it, so I bought a Vizio sound bar ($90) and that problem is solved.The internet connects very easily and Netflix on this set is great. We also have 2 Sony Blueray with internet, this set has more internet tcontent and options than my sony bluerays do.We paid 1600 for this set from Costco and with Costco you get a 2 year warantee.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best bang for the buck!", "Author": "RTM", "ReviewID": "R1K8K3N704TM40", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this Vizio yesterday at walmart. At first I was leaning to a Sony 55 inch LCD because of the brand name but it is only a tv with 120 hz and 150000 : 1 contrast ratio. It is 50 dollar cheaper than the razor vizio. When I went to walmart and the vizio is right beside the Sony I really see the difference in picture quality. Sony LCD looks pale while the vizio is very rich and vibrant in colors. That changed my mind aside from the vizio has Internet apps like netflix, etc and wifi built in. I got it home hooked it up and it was a breeze. Got the apps going, connected through a wireless DSL router ( I have ATT  pro service for $30.00 a month) all apps are working and it takes only a few secs to load. Tried netflix( I have a netflix account and now I don't need to turn on my ps3 to watch netflix, which will save me some electricity bills) vudu which is HD streaming and I got a free HD movie for signing up and works great with no buffeting once it start. Picture was amazing. I thought it will be the same as my older Sony 52 inch tv at 60 hz but it's 10 x better. I watched a bluray movie it almost like 3d in picture clarity, colors and quality except the images don't pop out.The only thing I noticed is when I was watching a web video and closed it then changed to my direc tv input there was a temporary no sound,I thought I mute the volume but it's not so I turned off the tv and when I turned it on I can hear the sound again. Other than that this TV is superb. I am just hoping this will be a reliable tv, it has a 50000 hrs of lamp life.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Shot craps after 35 days", "Author": "Windbreaker", "ReviewID": "R2V1R2V84RWR9W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really liked everything about this tv.

It quickly displayed how to hook up to the internet and with one HDMI cable I was loaded and picture was great.  The reason I gave it only 2 stars was because after having the TV for just 10 days I turned on the TV and  no picture.  I called customer service and they walked me through the power system but still no picture.  They would have to send a repair person to fix it and it would be 3-4 weeks.  I decided to just return the TV since I only had it for 10 days.  Also the TV has no controls on the unit itself so if you lose the remote the only thing you would be able to do is turn it on and off.

I got it from WalMart for $1548 with a $250 gift card and worth every penny.  Set up was easy, default picture settings need a little tweaking to suit my taste (i prefer darker, blacker image) and the remote is awesome with the bluetooth connectivity.  I did not get this for the internet apps but if you have Netflix, this TV is a perfect match with that widget.  Wireless N buffers for a few seconds and your movie starts immediately.  Sound is average but one can always add a soundbar or home theater setup, Plenty of connections for that and other peripherals.  I noticed some video noise on top of the screen on two TV channels that has 480p broadcast at the time and the manual says the TV is upconverting the signal to it's (TV) capabilities and the noise is the result of that.  No big deal, you can change your display setting to Wide, Zoom or Panorama or adjust the position or size and it goes away.  I loved it so much i also purchased the M470NV for another room in the house.Pros: 720p, 1080i and 1080p images, price, VIA widgetsCons: Not a whole lot.  (Nitpick:  Remembers the picture resolution of the last TV channel you viewed and it takes a couple of seconds to reformat; random popping sound when changing TV channels, could be DirecTV or audio setting I have to change; the screen can be overly bright but can be adjusted)", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "My TV crashes.

I would have returned this item or at least sent it in for warranty fix but the problems (other than poor color quality) happened right around the one year mark and Vizio couldn't have cared less about me once it was out of warranty (and honestly, before it was out of warranty as well).I highly suggest looking into another brand of T.V.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "great set", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R35NHA8450UGPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great picture. great menu. easy set up. works well. it occassionally reboots. great product for the price. it looks good.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy", "Author": "Dale", "ReviewID": "R1FQT9BINXO14V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy this.

It arrived on time and in perfect condition, and the setup took all of 10 minutes.It's just a FANTASTIC tv.  The picture is phenomenal, and it works great with my directv.  You don't even see the nonHD channels on the grid if there is an HD alternative.  The internet apps are great. I especially enjoy the twitter, local weather radar and facebook apps.  New apps are released often.  There were 60 or so when I bought the TV in January, and there are over 90 now.  The remote control has a slide out keyboard (and how cool is THAT?) that will control your satellite or cable box.There is one rather annoying little habit this TV seems to have;  it \"reboots\" (for lack of a better term) periodically.  the symptom is that the TV \"freezes\", and then shuts down.  The \"Vizio\" logo blinks amber and white for a minute or two, and then the TV comes back on.  I have been in contact with Vizio, and they assure me that this is NOT a manufacturing defect, but a firmware issue that will be addressed in the near future.  It seems to be rather loosely related to the number of internet apps you are running, but that is a guess.  I suppose some are written better than others.  You will need an internet connection for the apps to work, of course, and that isn't a big deal to set up.  The internet connection is also how it automatically downloads it's firmware updates.If I HAD to pick one thing to criticize, it would be the sound.  At some point, I am going to buy a surround sound system for it, so to the extent that it's a problem (which isn't significant by any means to begin with), that will take care of it.Vizio is a great product.

Set-up was real easy. It made the WiFi connection immediately, requesting the router's passcode which was keyed in on the remote, and also automatically downloaded (and installed) the latest firmware. Has a paper manual (note for possible LG buyers). Very happy with it. Remote is neat with the slide-out qwerty keyboard.For me the only acceptable setting is \"Vivid\", with Smart Dimming off, Ambient Light sensor Off, and Adaptive Luma at medium. The factory setting was/is too dark and dim.The pic is very even, with any program on, there is absolutely no noticeable brightness increase at the corners, or blooming; none whatsoever. With a totally blank screen (like at start-up with the \"v\" in the center), only then is a very-very slight diffused light seepage into the screen at the four corners.I purchased a Vizio soundbar even before the TV arrived, but without the subwoofer (refurb., under $80). I don't like subwoofers (boomy sound). The Vizio bar has surprisingly great sound, MUCH better than the Boston Acoustic sound bar WITH subwoofer, I also have with my other big screen TV. (the BA unit cost $300+ a few years ago, and I'm a professional level - but amateur - musician; acoustic polyphonic instrument, not guitar).I also like, that this unit has a variable analog(!) sound output (it has non-variable optical also), so the TV's remote works on volume and mute, instead of having to have a different remote for those functions. This is the reason why ANY LED 55\" TVs without a variable analog output were simply unacceptable. However, the equalizer settings do not seem to work on the analog variable volume level output, which is a minus.The problem is the same with this TV as is with top grade sound equipment. The higher the quality and capabilities of the unit (and this unit's are stellar) the more glaring and bothersome are the lesser quality material. Lots of networks, stations and ad agencies still use old, crap HD or non-HD equipment (cameras, recorders), and of course, on THIS TV anything less than top quality input is painfully and bothersomely obvious. In fact, I'm now so irked with the junk (cheap) input, that any company (advertising) or entity that doesn't have the full HD resolution, and pic size and aspect ratio I simply boycott.

Immediately, it had video artifacts/flickering on every input (Dish, PS3, media player).  Vizio's website even admits to this and promises that a firmware update and clean storage procedure would fix this!!! Vizio updated the firmware, and the issue appeared to be resolved for a few weeks, but then returned.  Vizio customer support had me do a power recycle, which resolved the issue for a few weeks, but, again the issues returned and new ones appeared - the video would freeze upon a cold start-up, the TV would turn off automatically in the middle of watching TV for no reason whatsoever. Vizio technical support had me do clean storage procedure which appeared to resolve the issue for a few days, but then the issues again returned.  Technical support  also admitted that the issue of the TV turning off intermittently will still be an issue until Vizio updates the firmware and they are looking into this issue now.  Through these issues, we could still watch TV - the issues were merely a nagging nuisance.  Finally fed up and fearful that the TV would fail once out of the warranty period, I called Vizio and they sent out a Technician to replace the logic board.  Within an hour after the technician left, the TV failed altogether.  Vizio now wants to replace my new TV that was defective upon arrival with a recertified TV which I objected to.  In order to get a new TV, they want me to pay an extra $300.00 plus tax!  I asked \"Ashley\" of Vizio customer support how she would feel paying good money for a \"new\" TV, but instead, getting a recertified TV.
