{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Let me clear up some misconceptions...", "Author": "hunter_aran", "ReviewID": "R1EZNV5XPKAFNE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great HDTV. Hands down is one of the most beautiful displays in this size. You can buy a fancier ultra-thin 32\" TV from Samsung right now but it's almost twice the price!Pros: The blacks are black! When you start it up, the Bravia logo appears on a black background and it's as black as when the TV is off! People say that edge LED lighting will make the blacks truer with less backlight bleeding but this TV is already great in this aspect. The colors and settings are very good out of the box for a few of the styles but need adjustment like any TV. The nice thing is that when you change your input, the TV remembers all the settings for that input! So it's like you never have to re-adjust your settings unless you plug your stuff in differently.The motionflow frame interpolation technology is astounding! 120HZ with the motionflow is  worth every penny for bluray and other high-def sources. That's why I waited for this over the XBR6. I however prefer the lifelike \"soap-opera\" look, but that's me (I have to say PE or the Pirates movies look stunning with it on!). You can turn it off or have this appear more more subtle (the default). The motionflow is basically a side-effect of the necessity to combat blurriness and the staggering \"judder\" effect inherent to LCDs. It adds one or more frames in between each frame of your source by interpolating entirely NEW frames that were never there by the TV's processor. technology is amazing, isn't it? You have to see it in person to get exactly what this looks like. Other companies are following suit but I find others like the 32 TOC Samsung have more motion artifacts (basically errors ie grabbing parts of the audience behind a fast-moving player in a sports event and dragging them along for the ride). Sony's Bravia processor is second to none. For upconverted sources not originally in 1080 and compressed 1080 cable, the motion technology is less noticeable. So the overall effectiveness depends on how clear the material is.This is important--with the game mode on, which turns off most processing, there is almost NO LAG. I am one of those demanding gamers who is very sensitive and complains about miniscule things like how much play there is in a joystick. So I can tell you that there is still a little lag but the game mode makes fast games like Smash Bros and shooters play like my CRT. So losing the motionflow in the game mode might seem bad, but it's only a small difference especially on something like the 480p Wii. And Wii games with anti-aliasing like Metroid Prime 3 still look AWESOME in contrast to what most say. The PS3 does look AMAZING either with or without motionflow anyway!Cons: Not many but the sound is tinny. What do you expect from such small speakers? If you spent this much on a 32 TV and don't have speakers then you should not complain.There is no headphone jack. I use a mixer with a control-room out to get around this and it works fine.The autodim is annoying but mainly happens for me when the room is VERY dark. In normal light I do not see it. And you cannot turn it off but with as many people as are complaining about it, all Sony has to do is release a firmware update to allow the switching on and off of it (Sony, are you reading this?)...CLARIFICATIONS-----Here are some points that I thought were incorrect in some other reviews so I felt compelled to make this clear to potential buyers.Okay some people just don't do their research in TVs. Sony's top line of HDTVs is the XBR line. The XBRs are split into the standard and then two higher end levels. Last year we had the XBR6s (standard XBR), XBR7s (larger fancier models) and XBR8 (larger still fancier models). This XBR9 IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR XBR8!! It replaces the XBR6 and the XBR8 was WAY more money and there was not even a 32\" one available! The reviewer who complained about there being no LED backlighting is wrong in getting upset because the XBR6 never had LED lighting and the XBR8 is a higher end unit which is different that the XBR9s. Sony will undoubtedly release an XBR10 and XBR11 or something to replace those two higher lines. Maybe in the next few years Sony will add edge LED lighting to the standard XBR line unless something like OLED takes off...Next the TV takes about as long to start up as my over 10-year-old Sony Trinitron 32\" XBR CRT does. Some models take longer some don't but it certainly is not 30 seconds! That reviewer must have gotten a problem unit or need a firmware update or something. Also, to change input, all you have to do is push \"Input\" then push that arrows up or down and that's it. Wow if that is too much for you, then technology is not your thing. Maybe you should hire someone to push the buttons for you so you don't have to. Come on.The thing has many inputs and, yes, some are on the side. On bigger TVs this would probably get covered up so on this one you can see some cabling if you have a thick cable that cannot bend easily. If you are clever you can use the cord-management strap to clean this up but my thick Monstercable does not bend that easily so I do see it. Oh well. So with thinner types of cables that bend back easily you should be fine. It's common knowledge that you get the same quality in a $5 HDMI cable as a $200 one because it is digital; getting a cheap thin one should solve the side cable-view problem. I wanted a more durable cable though.This is a relatively high-end HDTV that means it's designed to be used primarily to view HD content over a HDMI cables. That's why over half it's inputs are HDMI. So if you have a ton of stuff in composite or component, sorry, but Sony is trying to cater to the people who utilize the TV primarily for what it was designed for. Get a splitter/switcher or upgrade your cables to HDMI because, again, no matter how crappy your HDMI cables are, there is NO signal loss. There's an advantage to update anyway.Also contrary to popular belief numbers across different manufacturers ARE NOT EQUIVALENT. So comparing Lg to Sony to Samsung is not at all accurate. Think of comparing HP numbers in cars--measuring at the flywheel or tire gets you VERY different results and this often misleads consumers. Trust your eyes on a calibrated set with the same source. I can tell you this TV has more than enough contrast and is improved over last years model.----So far I have not had any problems with the TV and it looks amazing. I would recommend this to anyone and if you are internet savvy and find a good company to work with, you can find it for only slightly more than the closeout or last-year's KDL32XBR6 model--about $850 (or less, as in my case) :DEDIT: Thanks to other posters for mentioning this--Sony has released a firmware update that apparently makes the menus easier to navigate (faster?) and FIXES THE AUTODIM PROBLEM! I am trying to figure out how to install it now...", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but a Few Issues", "Author": "Liann", "ReviewID": "R1YJ965JEZLBYI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, let me say this TV excels on many levels.  Picture quality is great, pre-set picture settings are almost spot on, but plenty of flexibility to adjust, decent off-angel viewing, matte screen deals well w/ bright lighting (we have a lamp directly across from the TV and only notice a reflection in truly dark scenes), and of course the long history of Sony quality standing behind it.  However, unless the 120hz is a must for you, see if you can get your hands on a XBR6 on clearance.  The XBR9 doesn't add much more, and you do lose some features, like the on-screen tv guide, PAP/PIP, and the proprietary input for things like the ipod dock, etc.Minor Issues:  Sound quality is decent for a TV of this size, but audiophiles will want to add an external speaker system.  The bezel is highly reflective, which can be distracting depending on the lighting in the room.  Another thing to note is that the input menu has to be navigated with the arrow keys on the remote - can't just keep hitting the input button to scroll through - so depending on your satellite or cable remote, like us (we have DirectTV), you may not be able to use it to change inputs, and will have to use the Sony remote to switch b/t the SD box and HD antenna.Major Issue:  The biggest drawback on this set, for me, is the function that automatically adjusts the backlight based on screen brightness, and, so far, we cannot find any way to shut this off.  (Note, this is NOT the same as the light sensor, which you can, and I think should disable, as I think it produces kind of a muddy picture in all but optimal room light conditions.)  For average viewing, this is not a problem, and we did not discover the issue until watching The Prestige on TV a few weeks ago - the movie has many dark, candle/lamp lit scenes, and the dark-bright-dark-bright adjustments made the movie almost unwatchable at times.  It wouldn't be so bad if the adjustment was smoother, but generally a couple of seconds after the screen brightness changes there is a abrupt and significant darkening or brightening of the screen.  So if your main interest is gaming or watching movies that tend to have a lot of dark scenes, then this might not be the TV for you.  Even though we use this TV mainly to watch TV and the occasional DVD from NetFlix, and so will probably have to deal w/ this only occasionally, it's distracting enough when it does happen that, if we'd known about this issue in advance, we probably would not have purchased the TV.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony has fix for backlighting problem in the advanced contrast section.", "Author": "Ara \"Ara\"", "ReviewID": "R3MER6D4I1U14M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were unhappy with this TV and then found that Sony has fixed the back light issue so you can adjust it or turn it off and this has fixed the screen changing from dark to light with different scenes.  It was easy to down load this onto a usb memory stick and the TV automatically did the update.  The channels seem to change faster also.

Although the box was sealed and it was delivered by the outfit Amazon uses in our area, when I opened the box, it was clear that this was probably a return unit. The packaging was not sealed with blue tape that you often see on Sony products and the screws for the stand were missing. I called the Sony hotline and they were very nice and willing to send me the four screws, but it would take about a week or so. So, I asked the agent for the size of the screws or the part number which took her only about 2-3 minutes to retrieve. She didn't know the size, but when she told me the part number, it was obvious that the 4 missing screws were metric (M5 X 12). So, a quick trip to ACE yielded replacement screws for 19 cents apiece and I was able to attach the stand and set the TV up.This experience has made me wonder about how carefully Amazon is monitoring its vendors. This was clearly not a factory-sealed item - so one immediately jumps to the conclusion that there might be other ways to sell items for less than just volume buying. However, I must say that our general experience with Amazon has been outstanding, so this could just be a one-off, isolated incident. Anyway, if you end up needing the correct screws to attach the stand, now you know to purchase M5 X 12.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "MUST READ - A step in the wrong direction for SONY KDL-32XBR9", "Author": "Dennis Otieno \"Ukweli\"", "ReviewID": "R3OWLTAQ6CZ6JK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "MUST READ - A step in the wrong direction for SONY KDL-32XBR9I bought two of these TVs a week ago and just set one up a couple of days ago. I am a true sony fan since the WEGA editions and have stayed true to them. My largest screen 46\" is the an XBR5 model and I have loved it since. So when it came time to buy TVs for my bedrooms, I naturally thought the latest XBR would be just as good. How wrong was I?PROS:Picture quality is very good, one of the best. Glossy finish is classy and the sound quality is as best as it gets for this size TV.CONSOK, last year's model the XBR8 line used LED lighting which is supposed to be much better (read the reviews). Why did we go backward with the new XBR9 models?The TV takes 30 seconds to come on from the time the power button is pressed! My old Sony comes on instantly ....what is wrong with this TV and why did Sony put it on the market with such an annoying flaw? This slow response also happens when you cycle between inputs, not just when you turn the TV on. So fi you press the input button to change inputs from your TV to your Blu-Ray/DVD player, expect to wait another 30 seconds before you can see a picture ...go make you a cup of coffee!The video inputs are on the side of the TV. So expect cables to be visible from the side of the TV unless you spend money rewiring your AV with L cables. Also be warned, if you currently have two separate devices using S-Video and composite video (yellow), then you'll have to find a converter or adapter for one device because on this TV, Sony decided to place both inputs on the same video channel! So you can only use one or the other and there is only a single audio connection on that channel! I have an old home theater system for my bedroom with uses S-video and I love it (it's one of those things you buy with low expectations and it surprises you)! I also have surveillance security cameras using composite video. Now I have to buy an adapter to convert one input or lose it!Also you cannot press the input button multiple times to cycle between inputs. When you press input key multiple times, you can cycle through the top -> button inputs list but you cannot cycle back around to the top unless you use you up/down arrow keys to change/select the input you want. Expect to wait an additional 30 seconds to see a picture each time you change inputs! This makes switch back and forth between inputs a time consuming annoyance!Finally, don't let anyone fool you that the changing contrast on dark scenes is a minor issue. When watching regular TV, recorded TV, DVD/Blu-Ray, or HDTV, it takes about 15 seconds into a dark scene then all over a sudden the TV realizes it's a dark scene and instead of compensating by brightening the scene for better clarity ... it makes it darker! So when watching dark scenes, be prepared for them to get darker and this is drastic and very visible. Then when you return to a bright scene, the Tv does the reverse and brightens the scene. This is also sudden and visible...not to mention annoying! This, feature has no menu options to disable. I have gone through my entire TV menu and disabled all the advanced picture enhancements and it's still annoyingly there! Trust me, this is a deal breaker for me!FINAL TAKE:If you watch HDTV or use AT&T; U-Verse, make sure you go to your receiver's Menu>Options>System Settings>Aspect ratio and change your TV size to 1080i for optimal picture.I wish I could suggest going back to the XBR6 model but I will loose 120Hz refresh rate plus I will get a TV that is about 2 -3 years old already ...doesn't sound right.I will be returning these TVs back to the store and replacing them with the Samsung LN32B650. I feel so sad and betrayed by Sony. It's like realizing that someone you have loved and been loyal to just betrayed you and you don't want to leave but you know that you have to; for your own sanity!

We had a Sony XBR4 which died 2 months ago after only 20 months but luckily I remembered that Mastercard doubled the one year warranty and got a check back for $1,080 to buy a new set. At first, I was drawn to the amazing $1,300 Samsung LED with what seemed to be the clearest picture (the store had the Samsung LED on it's own Blue Ray player which was deceiving). Then I went to a big box retailer and looked at all the LCD (and LED) sets on the wall. The Sony XBR9 had the blackest blacks and the best picture by far! Then I did some research and found out that Sony sends out a free USB stick with updated programing for an even better picture. The picture now is downright amazing and golf on HD looks like you are right there. If I only had $400, I would go with the Vizio at Wallyworld. But at a $700 price point, the Sony XBR9 is a great deal. Keep in mind that LCD's will only last 5 to 7 years given that LCD is less durable than the old tube sets.

I recently started doing internet research since I wanted a new computer monitor and something to watch my Blu-rays on that was high definition. I wanted 1080P for maximum resolution and to make my Blu-rays look the best so the smallest you can get that in is 32' right now. Also right now there are only like 5 TV companies I think that have 32 with 1080P. After looking at them for a while I would say if you want the best it is this one I think it is the only one I found with 120hz refresh all the rest have 60hz. Also it had the second best contrast ratio but I think the Lg's was only 10000 above and all the others were way below. I was also looking at the Sharp AQUOS mainly because it says it has a gaming accelerator thing which it was still 60hz so I doubt that it would make up for it.  So in the end I went to best buy and bought one mainly because I wanted the 4 year best buy warranty since it is my first HDTV and so far everything seems to work great. It has a an advanced contrast adjuster which 2 times now has made the image darken during a movie for a a couple seconds but I probably just need to adjust the settings or shut it off.

Clark\"", "ReviewID": "R1V5YPYESCGJ19", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Sony 32XBR9 after carefully reading all possible reviews on this site and others. I decided after my experiences with other Sony products, it was worth the money. I ordered the set and was told delivery could be expected by September 3, 2009. Amazon has speciality shippers handle their television sets, not UPS or Fedex. The TV arrived in the Columbus depot where the shipper Pilot turned it iver to a third party carrier. There was where the problem started. The third party shipper only delivered in this area once a week or when they had a big enough load to justify the trip. Well, the only day they would bring it was Tueday, Sept 8, almost a week after the promised date. I called Amazon customer service and complained that since the TV was a gift and the party was September 4, it wouldn't do me much good. They called Pilot, and a guy named Zack from the shipper moved heaven and earth and had another third party shipper pick up the set and had it here on the 4th in the morning, I can't begin to tell you how impressed and appreciative I was. They even refunded shipping costs even though shipping was free! Great service Amazon and Pilot!Now back to the TV (which is what this review was actually about). The TV gets an excellent picture. I immediately did the software update from Sony which was a breeze. The sound is about right for that size TV. The picture is amazing. Hookup was fairly easy though I did not get sound on HDMI2. Still haven't figured that one out yet and may actually have to read the manual. I went into settings and set the picture to vivid (default is standard). Really made a difference, though it is ceratinly a matter of taste. When I went to input, it highlights the inputs that are active so there is little confusion getting to the peripherals.

My wife and i worked together to place it on equipment stand and hook up the hdmi cable and the external audio cables.  The documentation is not very extensive in its explanations.However I found that the controls/menu were easy to understand what effect they were having.  I had read all the comments for this unit before I purchased it and was aware of the complaints on the audio and the issue with the advance contrast enhancer with the flashing. I even had sent off for my usb flash drive before the tv arrived to fix the issue.  The picture is incredible and very 3d looking. I use my stereo system on the sound and not effected by the small internal speakers.  I had been using a tube type hdtv for the last 4 years and was not blown away by the first time seeing of hdtv, but yet as in many lcd displays, there is just a more deeper and life like image than the video seen on the tubes.  I was able to purchase this set from j&r; music via amason one day last week at the price of $749.99 and then the very next day it went back up to $789.99. Now that was sweet.  I am sure that more expensive and larger flat panel hdtv will have more options perhaps, but the price rises quickly after this unit.  I had to save for six  months to get this but It is well worth the price.

This is my first HDTV and after watching NFL Playoff games on my friend's HDTV and not having one of my own, I said no more. I have viewed many flat panel TVs at friends' and families' homes in the past few years. Everything from a low end 22\" Sony LCD TV from Walmart to a 60\" Pioneer KURO Plasma TV and I knew if I was going to buy an LCD TV, I wanted the video quality to be closer to the KURO than the Sony from Walmart. This 32\" Sony XBR9 was the only good branded 1080p TV that I could find with 120Hz refresh rate for less than $600 and I am very happy with it.PROS:1. Clear 1080p LCD with 120Hz refresh rate that almost anyone can afford.2. Inputs, inputs, inputs!3. Good menu with a lot of adjustments and the menu will actually tell you what each adjustment does so it is easy to get the picture you want.4. Home Theater PC looks great on PC input or on the HDMI.5. Very classy looking front panel and a \"Bravia\" splash screen when you turn the TV on.6. Software updates are a snap if you follow the directionsCONS:1. When the TV is viewed at an angle of 45 degrees or more from perpendicular to the panel of the TV the black level quality decreases. I start to see grays and dark greens in the black colors. With our specific setup in our family room, there is a seat that is almost exactly 45 degrees and it is pretty noticeable.2. 32\" TV that is 31.5\" viewable!?!?! What is that? I knew before I bought it, so I can't really complain, but I thought this was one of the reasons we dumped CRTs.3. Before the software update this past summer, I would not have enjoyed this TV as much as I do now. The dynamic back-lighting is really noticeable to the point of being annoying. After reading reviews on Amazon, I downloaded the update and had it ready on a USB stick before I even received the TV. My kids started getting impatient while I was setting up the TV so I let them watch Cars out of the box without changing any settings. It was almost unwatchable for me and even my 3 year old complained that she wanted the other TV back (Toshiba 32\" SD CRT). I updated the firmware, turned off the dynamic back-lighting, and turned off Cinemotion. With those three changes, the picture improved dramatically.4. Side inputs. There are 9 inputs on the side of the TV, NINE! (1 USB, 1 PC input, 3 HDMI, 1 S-video, 1 composite video, 2 channels analog audio) All of the cables from these inputs stick out from the side and can be seen while watching the TV. Luckily, I have figured out how to use my home theater receiver to handle my 6 video sources and run one HDMI cable to the single HDMI input on the back.Even with these few cons that I can live with, this is a great TV for the price.

Audio, but no video.So, I also have the cable going directly into the antenna input.GO back and forth between HD and SD channels....no pop. No problems.This tv tells you what signal you're getting as well, 1080, 480, even 720.A simple Google search tells me that this problem has been going on for MONTHS for Comcast customers, and with other brands of televisions as well.It's the box, not the tv.Will Comcast fix this?Maybe in ten years, who knows?Also, they promised us DVRs in the Motorola box made by TiVo, and we're still waiting for that.Bottom line: great picture on the tv (for a good price), minor things you can live with, and Comcast sucks.", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazed", "Author": "backdoc", "ReviewID": "R1X760SPTACMQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Sony TV.

I've owned it for a little over 2 months now and have gotten a lot of use out of it already.Right out of the box the TV not only looked great but had a sturdy feel to it.  This is a well designed TV and doesn't feel flimsy or cheaply made.  Other reviewers are complaining about some of the inputs being on the side of the TV - it's not a problem.  There is enough of a gap between the inputs and the edge of the TV where any cables plugged into the side inputs can be neatly tucked around and behind.The picture quality is amazing.  Playing PS3 and XBOX 360 via HDMI looks phenomenal.  Bluray movie and picture quality is amazing as well.  I also have this thing doubling as a computer monitor via HDMI.  There is a small ghosting effect on dark areas but I'm not surprised by that; this wasn't purchased with the intent of a gaming monitor for my computer but it's amazing how fun games are on a screen this big.  Watching streaming HD content off the internet looks great too.  The fact that this is 1080p and also 120hz makes just about anything look spectacular on here.  There really is nothing bad to say about the picture quality on this set.  All Sony Bravia television sets that I've viewed I have been very impressed with the picture quality.The sound is something that I was a little disappointed on.  The built in sound on the TV isn't bad by any means, however, it's not great either.  You can't turn the volume up too loud otherwise the sound will really begin to distort.  Low and mid volumes are the best way to listen with just the built in speakers.  I eventually plugged into an external sound system and it sounds much better that way.  I would recommend future (and current) owners to go this route to get the best sound quality.Other various built in features I think are a nice compliment to the set.  The menu functions are easy to use and navigate through.  There are a lot of options to change around and edit, which is a nice bonus I think.  The remote isn't bad either.  I didn't order a firmware update from Sony but instead downloaded the latest firmware from their website and installed it myself.  Wasn't difficult at all - the directions online to do this are easy enough to follow.Overall I'm incredibly satisfied with my purchase.  I would definitely purchase another one of these if given the opportunity, and would definitely recommend this set.  I was on the fence for several weeks deciding on which HDTV to get.

After doing much research on LCD TVs and because we do not buy TVs very often - we chose this upscale Sony TV.  It has been as advertised!  Regarding some of the criticism on this TV that the screen seems to go \"dark\" sometimes which is likely tied to the energy saving features -- there is supposed to be a firmware upgrade; my TV was manufactured in November 2009 and it came from the factory with the firmware already upgraded.  However, we still experience the \"dark\" screen sometimes.  What I have discovered - is if I have a VCR connected and play a VHS tape from a recorded TV show - the screen will consistently seem to go dark frequently during the playing of the tape.  If I take that VHS tape and convert it to DVD, and then play the DVD on the Sony TV - it plays just fine and the screen does NOT go dark.  So - I'm not sure exactly what this means - except maybe just don't play VHS tapes to this Sony unless you first convert them to DVD.

I called Sony customer service to find out how to check which firmware version was installed so that I could determine if the update was necessary at all.  The TV had not even been delivered yet, but Sony support was very nice and told me where to find the information in the television setup menu.  Delivery was uneventful via FedEx and arrived on time.  I ALMOST did not even consider this televsion when I read another reviewer's comments concerning the side connections.  Luckily, I was able to find a display locally and determine it was NOT an issue at all for any that may be concerned.  I used all 4 HDMI ports, including the 3 on the side.  The cables can be snugly fit behind the televsion frame so that they are not visible.  The television had a recent manufacture date of November 2009, and was already upgraded to the latest firmware at the factory.  The picture was out of the box beautiful.  Blu-Rays, DVD's, and HDTV (comcast) are jaw dropping gorgeous.  It looks better than my 40\" Sony KDL-40V2500 that I have been very pleased with as well.

I would like to clarify something that another review wrote about, they said it did not pick up thier basic cable signal. I don't what the problem was but I have basic cable and NO CABLE BOX and it picked up every channel I had before I got the Monitor and also picks up all the Music only channels now as well as a few HD (1080I) channels as well. I looked on the back and the monitor was made in July of 2009. I have no complaints about this Monitor what so ever. If you are looking for a 32\" LCD this is hands down the one to go with. I wished I had the budget to buy the 46 or the 52\" XBR 9. For those of you who don't know anything about the Sony XBR line, let me put it to you in an easy to understand explanation, Toyota has it's High End cars under the name Lexus, Honda has it's high end cars under the name of Acura and Sony has it's High End Monitors under the name of Sony XBR.

I already own two Sony Tube TV but decided it was time to purchase a new flat screen TV. I purchased a  Sony Bravia XBR KDL-32XBR9 based on my past experience with Sony products and consumer reviews. I put the new TV in my remodeled kitchen - the picture quality was great. Unfortunately, I lost the picture within a month. It seems the HDMI connections failed. I notified Sony Customer Service and within a week a technician came out and replaced the circuit board. The TV was back in business; however, within another month or so,  the HDMI failed again. I notified Sony Customer Service again and they promptly came out and fixed it again. This time I wasn't too happy so I wrote to the head of Sony USA and complained. I said while the Customer Service was great, I wasn't happy that a new TV would fail so soon. I wrote that I've bought 5 Acura cars since their inception and Apple Computer products since 1989 and none of these products have ever failed like my new XBR. I also explained that while  Sony does offer a refurbished TV in place of a problem TV under warranty that wasn't the point and explained that if I wanted a refurbished TV I would have bought one - I bought a new TV and expected it to work. After the head of Sony USA received my letter I got a phone call from a Customer Service Rep. She acknowledged my complaint and said because of my problem that Sony was going to extend my warranty for another six months. I told the rep while that was nice it doesn't do me any good since I already have  Sony Extended Warranty coverage. Well to make a long story short, the HDMI connection has failed for a third time last week. I put another call into Sony Customer Service using the so-called special phone number the last Customer Rep gave me. The new rep that answered the phone reviewed my case and then came back on the line and said because of the problems my TV was having, he would have to turn the problem over to a special group. The rep said the someone from the new group would contact me in a day or so. Well, that day or so has come and gone. So much for ever buying another Sony product.

I asked Amazon (at least 4 to 5 times) if they could honor the transaction but to no avail. Later I contacted J&R; and they offered to sell me the TV for the same price (as on the day after Thanksgiving). Again their Billing department gave me a hard time.

Martin \"Darkbard\"", "ReviewID": "R2H91X73M4867K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bottom-Line: Despite the rather high entry price ($1199.99) I have nothing but enthusiasm for the \"Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV.\"I am a man; as my wife will most surly attest.  And like \"almost\" all men I love all things electronic; the more buttons, LED's, and controls, the better!  No, I do not spend all of my time buried knee deep in the written word, or studying the arcane and convoluted tomes of computer manuals.  I do take an occasional break and lose myself in the increasingly unwashed world of television.  And when I do I want to behold a picture that is bright and brilliant, and as vibrant and sharp as the world itself, and with sound that rivals the richness of my living room Bose 501's. So eventually I had to enter the sweet spot that is High Definition Television or HDTV.With the move to an all digital broadcasting standard next year the wife and I decided to replace our trusty 32\" tube Sanyo with a 32\" \"Sony BRAVIA XBR Series Black LCD Flat Panel HDTV.\"  At first I had thought to purchase the non-XBR model of this same screen size, but in the end decided to spend the movie and get something I knew we would grow into; after all the Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV has a whopping (4) HDMI inputs as well High Definition Composite Video, and (6) audio outputs!So, off to the Internet and Circuit City.com (and the brick & mortar storefront) I surfed to read, look, listen, and feel.  Sharp, Phillips, Vizio, Toshiba, Samsung, and Sony all fell under the Bards' discerning microscope.  In the end, after about a four month search and countless hours of rumination, the Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV came out the clear choice.I briefly considered Vizio because of the cost (they are wonderfully cheap), but I read too many horror stories about the unit(s) catching on fire, or those that just stop working after a year or so; I passed.  I passed too on the Sharp Aquos after reading review after review about their less than stellar reliability record.  After comparing the BRAVIA and the Aquos side-by-side on the showroom floor I have to say that the two displays were close, but in the end Sony got the nod because it is a name I can trust and almost all of the components in my home A/V system are Sony.The beautiful black Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV (model number KDL32XBR6) is a true flat-panel that offers up to 1920x1080 Full HD 1080p Resolution, as well as Digital Media Extender (DMex), BRAVIA Engine 2 Technology, Advanced Contrast Enhancer (ACE), Enhanced (XMB) User Interface with rich 3D Graphics, 24p True Cinema, and (4) HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) ports.This plethora of video-enhancement features helps Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV deliver an excellent video image straight from the box.  The factory video settings were fairly accurate, though the screen was rather bright; a screen button on the slim-line remote control allows you to toggle through a number of pre-defined screen settings in order to tone down the brightness.  I plugged the television into the Dish Network ViP 722 HD satellite receiver via an HDMI cable and away I went, nothing could be easier.However the \"Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV\" will accept all matter of inputs including composite video, S-Video, and good ole coaxial cable.  Digital as well as analog audio outputs are available if you want to connect the unit to an A/V receiver.  I utilized the analog audio connection and I am quite please with the sound.  Be forewarned: if you use the audio out connections you will not be able to utilize the internal speakers.But if you do decide to utilize the \"Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV\" internal speakers, you can't go wrong they feature Sony's patented TruSurround SRS technology.  TruSurround delivers compelling 5.1 multichannel virtual surround sound experience through any two-speaker playback system, including internal television speakers and headphones.  High-quality virtual surround sound can be experienced with just the two hidden, downward-firing side-mounted 2.2-channel dome speakers built into the TV along the bottom of the display.All of the controls for the \"Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV\" are located on the top of the unit--not very convenient, especially if you place the unity inside of an entertainment unit, like I did.  Since the entire chassis is black including the control buttons, it has impossible for me to get at said buttons.  No matter, the remote control is excellent.First Impressions:The Sony BRAVIA XBR (KDL32XBR6)32-in LCD HDTV, is the company's top-of-the-line, 32-inch LCD high definition television and is the idea HD solution for our rather tight living room space.  It takes its place in the room without overpowering the space.  The picture quality is superb, and without peer.  The colors are rich and vibrant, sharp and deeply accented.  And the blacks are indeed black!  In addition to the aforementioned satellite receiver I have also mated the Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV with a black Sony DVP-NS700h up-scale HD DVD player and the combination of the two serves up a stunning picture.Speaking of the image, I have absolutely no complaints about it; in fact I could not be happier with the image quality and features the Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV brings to the viewing table.  My satellite HD receiver only offers 1080i resolution while the Sony DVP-NS700h offers true 1080p.  With (4) HDMI inputs, including one on the left-hand side of the unit, the unit is highly versatile and expansive.  The on-screen menus are many, but they are easy to use; I spend about 10 minutes familiarizing myself with the well laid out controls and I have now mastered them.I have lived with the \"Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV\" for almost a month now and I have to save that I love the set and do not regret my (expensive) purchase.  My spouse, who at first was a skeptic, loves the set as well.  The sleek design and black color complements the d\u00e9cor in our living room.  The picture can easily viewed from straight forward and slightly off-center; too far off center however and the image loses a considerable amount of brightness.Despite the rather high entry price ($1199.99) I have nothing but enthusiasm for the \"Sony BRAVIA XBR 32-in LCD HDTV\" and I have no problems recommending the set.  The set is just the right size for our rather uniquely shaped living room and is well worth the wait.

Samsung or Toshiba will be my next buy...Uncle Ron", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "XBR9 Not As Good As XBR6", "Author": "MattC", "ReviewID": "R1KV5WBZ1FXHPP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well as the title of my review states, I didn't like the xbr9 as good as the xbr6.I bought the xbr6 at Best Buy.I got it home and hooked it up and loved the picture and sound.I also liked the TV Guide feature and the PIP feature.I liked this tv so much that I decided to take it back after a couple of days and get the newer xbr9.This is probably one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made.I didn't like the sound through the tv speakers as well as the xbr6 and the picture to me was grainer.Well, to make a long story short,I boxed the xbr9 back up and returned it to Best Buy.I was hoping that when I got there the xbr6 that I had bought first was still there.When I walked back in the store, a surge of relief came over me.They hadn't sold my xbr6 yet.Remember, this was the only xbr6 they had in the whole town because it was an older model.I was so thrilled that I was able to trade my brandnew xbr9 back for my xbr6.When I got it home I started to breathe normally again knowing that I would never lose this model again.I agree with one of the reviewers on the xbr9 that the xbr6 is better.The xbr9 just looked and sounded so much worse in my house at the same exact hook-up place as I was using for the xbr6.Anyway, now I am so thrilled to have things back the way they were before. I made a terrible mistake. Luckily,I was able to undo the mistake I made.I think I thought in my mind that since I liked the xbr6 so much,I would really love the xbr9.Not so.I really thought the grass was greener on the other side but it wasn't for me.Sony Bravia XBR-Series KDL-32XBR6 32-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Slow as turtle", "Author": "Bonsue Boulom", "ReviewID": "ROML6QEKGWTOY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a big fan of Sony when it comes to TV. I bought 32XBR4 in 2007, trusted the brand so much, didn't buy extended warranty, a year and a half later, tv got virtical lines, took it to the repair shop, they told me it's the panel, and if I need to repair it, it will cost me $800 just replace the panel. I was so heart broken, could not look for another tv for about 6 months. April 2009, new 32XBR9 came out, I thought newer is better, because it should have new technology. I got all excited, went to Best Buy and got myself another Sony TV 32XBR9. At first it didn't hit me, I thought maybe because it's still new, 2 weeks has goneby, the damn TV was still too slow, 2X 1/2 slowwer that XBR4 I had before, plus the features, you have to use menu, there's no button on the remote, very annoying, inconvenient, and waste of my money, so I return it after 3 weeks.

I checked the reviews on Amazon of the TV we bought, and there are many reports of the same problem as our TV. Sony, are you reading this? People read this and don't buy your TV's. Our older 27 inch WEGA is still working like the day we bought it. How is it that the quality can go down so fast? I believe the issue is more widespread than just our TV.

Ive owned several Sony Trinitron TV's as well as various other Sony products.  I do not think this TV is worth its price point.  I was in the market for a new 32 inch LCD to replace my old 32 inch Samsung LCD from 2005.  I really was only going to consider another samsung or a sony, because of how pleased i am with my playstation 3.  I'm going to start by saying that the XBR9 has a nice picture, but thats where it ends.  The TV takes an honest 30 seconds to turn on, had an extremely cheap build quality, pathetic sound, and a design that is just not on par with a comparable samsung. The tv cant even pivot on its base.  The base of the tv is one of the cheapest looking piece of garbage bases that i have ever seen.  The set does not deserve the XBR branding.  In the end when i saw the samsung LN32B640 right next to the XBR9 at best buy there was no comparison.  The XBR looked like it was a VIZIO next to the samsung.  Needless to say i went with the samsung.
