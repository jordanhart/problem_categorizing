Oakwood", "ReviewID": "RGSIOYX3FBFQ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV was easy to set up and to apply options to your liking.  Sound is ok after you do some tweaking to the sound settings.  Picture  is  actually pretty good, even though I am watching a standard def source from Dish satellite (using ch 3).  To my amazement, this Proscan remote is using some frequency that is not found in any universal remote library.  Dish, Direct, or several cable remotes cannot be programmed to operate any functions of this TV.  I even bought a name brand \"universal\" remote, but the code was not found for it either. This is a ridiculous oversight by a want-to-be brand.  If you receive your TV signal by antenna and have no need for a second remote than you will be ok with this model.  Another \"stupid logic\" problem with this TV is how the remote channel button, if accidently touched, changes the TV from the input/source setting (such as HDMI or AV) to the TV tuner mode.  So to reset TV to previously selected input source you must make up to 5 remote button clicks to get back to the source you were watching.  So one accidental channel button click will take up to 5 more clicks to get back to what you were watching.  Proscan is not the only manufacturer of this stupid logic, but why they would program the channel button on the remote to activate the source back to the tuner is just that....stupid.  Had I known these two quirky features were found on this unit, I would have picked another brand.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very poor quality - DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Joseph P.
