But this TV impressed me so much...I should say this is as good as any Sony or Samsung TV's of its class. I got this for $1180 during thanksgiving...very good price for a 47 1080p lcd hdtv. It has two hdmi inputs .... which produces sharp and true color pictures when connected to a HD DVD. Even the normal def tv channels look great with slight pixellation which is almost invisible unless you sit right in front of the TV (no moron would do that). Setup was easy and the remote provided is a universal remote..which readily connected to my existing electronics. The weight and dimensions are pretty decent and looks great with the black matte finish. The remote is somewhat crowded...with buttons going all the way down - not a biggie if you don't channel surf.All in all...it's a great buy...and since it is very new in the market..u wudnt find many reviews for this model.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent LCD for the price...", "Author": "Volkan Ozduran", "ReviewID": "R1OQTDJVEO3B76", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the 47\" Olevia 247tfhd from circuit city thanksgiving online deal for $1100 . I did not really know what to expect but the deal was too good to miss.This TV turned out excellent. It has very natural colors. LCD screen is actually build by sharp. HDTV looks perfect. Sound is very good, much better than what you would expect for the price. Menu system is nice when you get used to it. Built quality is good. My only complaint is that I could not program its remote to my comcast remote.I would recommend this tv without hesitation.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price!", "Author": "Eric Argel", "ReviewID": "R1AOHHWQ8IDKAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing TV for the value.  TV looked great out of the box but even better once I fidgeted with the picture controls.  SD content over my cable box looked surprisingly good.  I have this connected to my xbox360 and HD content looks great.  Don't be fooled by the name, this TV is easily comparable to TVs that are thousands more.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Really an exceptional deal", "Author": "Jon S. Turner \"Jon Turner\"", "ReviewID": "R1A2TYXCV9RJEN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This television is really an exceptional deal.  I had been slow to upgrade to HD in the bedroom, but, after reading reviews in CR (where it was noted as a \"Great Buy\") I checked it out at a local retailer.  I was able to get one for under $1100 and am extremely happy with it.  Big, bright, clear, cheap (but not cheaply made)--everything you'd want!  I especially appreciate the fact that it was surprisingly easy to set up.  I don't have a dish or cable connection in the bedroom, so, I just hooked it up to a very old antenna (probably was used to pick up Ed Sullivan) and the television automatically searched for the channels in my area and presto, up and running in literally under 5 minutes. I live approximately 50 miles from the nearest television towers and all expected channels came in perfect.  I'm even receiving a number of channels that I didn't even know where available in our area.  The design is nice and understated, although the blue light on the front when the television is turned off is a bit bright for a bedroom (although I think there is a way to turn that off-just haven't figured it out yet).  Remote is very nice with soft rubbery keys that have back lighting.  I think anyone would be happy with this purchase.", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great product for the price!!!", "Author": "E. Alpan", "ReviewID": "R1RRASMIG0S1EK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this product during an online special for $1099. After having it for almost a month I have to say the picture quality for the HD channels are amazing. I also own Sharp LCD, and Olevia has better picture quality than my Sharp. The SD channels are not that great, but who buys a 1080P to watch SD channels right :). I didn't get a chance to test 1080P resolution yet but once I get my HDDVD player (hopefully for x-mas) I will add the comments for that as well. For me it was a great deal...", "Date": "December 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great picture, only flaw is can't setup other remotes with it", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R26L7T86YD4ARP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this elsewhere day before Thanksgiving, price was amazing including a 10% off coupon putting it below $1,000.

This tv cost me $791 on sale @ Target. I bought an Olevia blu ray player at the same time and the two items work great together and I have not had any problems with either of them.

But a few minor flaws", "Author": "New York Bargain Hunter", "ReviewID": "RMGRBYNYUFNKS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This television is everything that everyone else is throwing five stars at it except for two problems.  The first one is tiny, which is that the black is not black enough, basically if you are watching a night scene it will cause you to squint.  So unless you are watching Alien V Predator, the view is as good as the \"BRAND NAME\" television sets.  The second problem irks the heck out of me which is the PIP.  It's awesome that it has PIP but the PIP selections are very limited.  You can only watch HDMI with everything else, otherwise you are stuck with a limited selection such as components 1-2 or VGA with everything else.  You can not match composites 1 and 2 or S-wire with composites or either with a regular quam tuned channels.  So unless you can figure out how to hook up a Wii via HDMI you can't watch the game and lose weight on your Wii fit at the same time.  The blue night-light is also annoying, I ended up putting a piece of electrical tape on it, it's really bright.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV", "Author": "S. Barfield", "ReviewID": "R55RU9H6RJWC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is great picture is great and the coolest feature is the split screen feature where you can watch or play to diff things at once. for ex. you can play ps3 and the wii at the same time or you can watch a movie on your hd or blu-ray and have the same movie on your  standard player at the same time to see the diff. i love to do that to my friends that say theres no diff between hd and standard.  and for $1000 - $1200 you cant and wont find a better tv. trust you dont have to spend the extra 1000 just for a sony, you can get a system for your home theater to go with this tv instead.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Device Type - LCD TV\nDimensions - 45.38\" x 31.92\" x 11.42\"\nWeight - 87.1 lbs\n- HDTV: HDTV Built-In\n- Native Resolution: 1920x1080", "Name": "Olevia 47-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31GffUuYO9L.jpg", "ProductID": "B000UI8U5E"}}
