I ended up purchasing the SP185 a couple of weeks later for above my spa-style Jacuzzi tub and it is great! Everyone loves it, bath time has never been so easy with my kids (just pop in a movie and they're good to go!). The appears as a mirror so its not an eye soar in the bathroom. I Would definitely recommend this company and their products! Also, I ordered my shipment on a Monday night and it arrived that following Thursday (they used UPS ground shipping). Thank you Evervue!
