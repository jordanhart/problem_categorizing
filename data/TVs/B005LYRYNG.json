My first was a Toshiba DLP, and it was a lamp hog. Then a Toshiba 50 inch plasma, which failed in 3 years, then LG's first 1080p 60 inch plasma (Still working great), a Mitsubishi 73 inch DLP, (Still working great), and now, the ultimate plunge with this Sharp 80 inch TV.My viewing area for this TV is 12 feet at its closest and 15 at the farthest, and I instantly thought when I turned this monster on, that I should have stayed with the 70 incher.  Oh well, it is mine and I am happy with it.For its size, this TV is well made and looks nice.  Picture quality is excellent as close as 3 feet, and then as far back as you can go.  I also purchased this TV from a major retailer in Texas because Amazon would not take 2 credit cards, and G. E. gave me more 36 months interest free credit at the Texas retailer than they did at Amazon on the store card, so Amazon lost the sale.  I also looked for quite awhile at the, the Sharp 70 inch, and the Panasonic 65 inch VT30 Plasma, and I chose this TV for several reasons.  Overall for size, quality, and looks, coupled with its truly great picture and excellent blacks.  Remember, the better the blacks, the better the color, because black is the number one color in the color scheme.I gave this TV 5 Stars because of its numerous features and control ability with its menus. The picture is also superb, but the Panasonic 65VT30 still has a little better picture quality SAVE AND EXCEPT LED LOOKS MORE NATURAL. I ADD THIS BECAUSE I STILL HAVE MY 60 INCH lg PLASMA IN MY BEDROOM, AND THE SHARP LED IS MUCH EASIER ON THE EYES THAN THE PLASMA AND NOT OVER CONTRASTED.  LED is rapidly gaining on plasma though. Overall, I love this TV, and I will finally stop looking for awhile, because it is like being in a movie theater every time I turn it on. It also does not have the delay when turned on like the Mitsubishi DLP.  The other good thing is when this TV is on all day, it is cool to the touch, where the Panasonic plasma is not.Some settings from the calibration of my set, which I noticed was great out of the box, but it was somewhat to the red side on the tints.  My calibration settings are as follows, and this was professionally done, and will help the rest of you get yours close.  Mine now rocks!Picture SettingsMode - StandardBack light  +8Contrast  + 26Brightness + 8Color +5Tint + 8 to greenSharpness + 5AdvancedC.M.S. HueRed  -1Yellow  - 2Magenta + 2C.M.S. Saturation all at 0C.M.S. Value all at 0Color Temp all at 0Active contrast  OnGamma  - 1Range of OPCMax +4Min  -2These settings should get yours into the calibrated ball park, and I have messed with the Sharp line of large TVs for quite awhile, and they are all somewhat to the red side out of the box. I also would not want to ruin a perfect record of Amazon Reviews by giving this TV any less than 5 stars, because I cannot. This TV deserves and has earned all 5 stars in this rating.UPDATEI started having picture problems with mine the next day, and almost sent it back, but I found a loose Monster HDMI cable, and it was also defective. A new  Monoprice cable for 10 bucks fixed the problem, and the picture is absolutely stunning. So do not trust anything. Always check your cable CONNECTIONS, and don't pay those high prices for Monster Cables. They're not worth the price difference, and are way over priced.UpdateMine has been on 8 - 12 hours per day, and it has the most stunning picture over and above even the Panasonic and Lg Plasma. Trouble Free, and Sharp even called to make sure I was happy with the product. I have seen the 3d, and it is good, but I my self would not want to watch 3D all the time, so I am very satisfied with this product, and I would buy another one if I had a place to put it. Read the other reviews, this TV rocks and the picture far exceeds theater quality.  I also recommend the DVDO Edge Green to which I own 2. One on my Sharp 80 and one on My LG 60 inch Plasma. The DVDO is a video processor with lots of features that will enhance any picture on any TV and up convert and signal in to 1080p 24Hz, and it really works, plus it automatically switches from the DVR to the next component turned on like a Oppo Blu-ray, or DVD Player or surround sound. The DVDO Edge is the best kept secret in the entire electronic industry, AND MINE IS ABOUT 3 YEARS OLD AND STILL GOING STRONG.February 5, 2013 UPDATEI am over a year now with this TV, and it has been the most enjoyable purchase I have ever made.  I have not had one iota of trouble.  The picture is clear, crisp and much better, easier to view, and not over enhanced like my 60 plasma.  Honestly, I bought this TV because of its size, and now I realize, Sharp makes one of the finest products out there.  It is all in the settings, and keeping the firmware up to date.  Wish I had the money, I'd put one in every room, and now, I'd give it 10 stars.UPDATE: July 16th, 2013I have had many people contact me regarding this review, and I do not mind. I am glad I can help. My TV is still going strong, and trouble free. The other thing I want to say, is that my above settings were made after I had 100 hours on the TV and it had cooked in as we say. By then, all of the electronic components are fixed and all of the fluctuations are gone.  I have not touched it since. Every time someone walks into my living room, their jaws drop. So I just want to say again, this is the absolute best money I have ever spent on entertainment in my 63 years on this planet.  SO I CAN'T DO IT UP TOP, BUT I AM ADDING 5 MORE STARS TO THIS TV WITHOUT HESITATION!UPDATE: November 27th 2013Well, if you haven't bought one, you don't know what you are missing. I have not had one iota of a problem, not even a bad pixel, nor have I had to change any of the above settings. THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST ENTERTAINMENT $$$ I EVER SPENT. At first I was leary about Sharp, because they had their ups and downs. This TV has been a jewel and the crown of my entertainment system and it is a very top of the line TV. Glad I didn't get the quatron. To me, that TV has a yellow haze that is hard to remove during calibration. Save your money, and buy one, you wont regret it.Dale in Texas", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "More than just a big set", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3NUWUJO3TI036", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would consider myself a home theater enthusiast (although I am sure owning an 80\" might be a give away on that ;) ).  As such, I constantly find myself comparing sound systems, displays, and other home entertainment devices with friends, or simply visiting stores or reading articles on the latest releases.  When I heard an 80\" full backlit display would be available for under $4K I was intrigued, when i heard it was a Sharp I was skeptical...  Spending some time on AvsForum I couldn't help but notice all threads had nothing but glowing comments from people and calibrators I place a lot of trust in.I went to a local BestBuy to view it, and was disappointed.  However, having worked at CircuitCity in my college years I know all to well you cannot trust what you see in electronic stores as many simply have the contrast and backlight cranked up to the max, or using the dreaded \"dynamic store mode\".Luckily I had brought a USB key with some 1080P trailers and some settings from AvsForum to use as a reference. Settings in place, I immediately knew i had found my next set.Seeing the set in the store you realize it is very large, getting it into your house... well that is a feat in itself. Fortunately at just a bit over 120lbs it is not much heavier than the 60\" plasma it replaced, but with nearly double the surface area it is a huge difference in a viewing experience.So onto the good items:Movie Theater Sized viewing at home (Yes, i know projectors are bigger, but for those of us without dedicated theater rooms this works great, even in bright room conditions).Picture quality (with the right settings this set is scary accurate and gorgeous to watch)Easy to mount (with a set this wide you may be concerned about finding a bracket to mount it, but the VESA mount points are industry standards and work well with a variety of mounts)Built in Wifi that works very well on my networkNice codec support on the USB playback. (I have watched many shows/videos/photos from a thumb drive)Understated design (this will vary from person to person, but I like my TVs to not draw attention to themselves when off, although with a set this big that is hard) It has a minimal, no frills frame that i prefer.Very good 60Hz performance while watching sports/fast moving shows. (I am not a fan of artificial refresh rates and keep mine in game mode)Playing PS3 on this set is phenomenal, as is Blu-Ray performance.Cons:Viewing angles at closer distance are limited (this is not a fault of the set, when viewed from an appropriate 10+ feet the viewing angle is quite good) compared to a plasma, but this is true for most non IPS LCD displays.Um... honestly i haven't found many other faults. Just don't expect for view from 5 feet away and have the same sharpness as a 40inch, this is made to be seen from a distance away.Overall, this is the greatest set i have owned.Couple of tips: if you want an extended service plan you can buy directly for just a few hundred dollars for a total of 4 years.  (This is the best deal I am aware of)Please (for your sake and mine) don't use dynamic picture mode!  Below are my settings (this is designed to be accurate to colors and brightness) but I encourage your to experiment to find your own settings as each set seems to have different Red saturation levels.Game Mode:opc offbacklight = 2Contrast  = 26BRIGHT = 1COLOR = -5Tint = 4Sharp = 0HueR 5Y 1G -8C 1B 3M -3SatR -10Y 2G 0C 0B 13M 1ValueR 3Y 0G 13C 0B 30M 0Temp (Low)R 13Y 0G -29C 3B 0M -18Active Contrast = OffGamma -2DNR = OffMonocrome OffRange of OPC N/AHappy Viewing!!!", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture quality", "Author": "L.A.", "ReviewID": "RKUNNIL6PQ6EZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We shopped for this locally because we wanted to see the size and picture quality in person and it's amazing. The picture is crystal clear and almost looks 3d due to the amazing depth it shows. We looked at it next to the 70\" Aquos as well as other LED TV's and the Aquos line by far has the sharpest, clearest picture. If you are considering either the 70\" or the 80\" it obviously comes down to economics, but I can tell you the 80\" definitely dwarfs the 70\" when they are next to each other. We wanted a TV that would essentially look like a movie screen in our living room and the 80\" takes up a big part of the wall.

We have all type of audiophile, videophile, computer hardware / software, eletronic equipment, etc. Tons of gizmos and gadgets. This TV rates as one of the top 10 (probably top 5) eletronic purchases we have ever made, period.Practically everything about this TV is excellent. The picture is STUNNING with Blue Ray, HD and high-resolution picture content. The black levels in particular are impressive. Even with lower definition content the picture looks good. The options / controls for the TV are exellent. You can tune the picture to your exact liking, and the standard picture settings are helpful and quite good. (We tend to like Dynamic - Fixed the best). The software on the device is solid. The built-in video / audio / picture software allows us to access movies, music and photos on our home NAS (disk drives on our home network) at the click of a button. VERY COOL, and limits the need of using our XBOX or PC just to stream certain types of media content to the TV. The TV also connects to the Internet for device updates and things like weather, news, Netflix and other common uses. Very cool, although the built-in apps on the TV are fairly basic and a tad slow ... not to be compared to PC apps and XBOX, but acceptable nonetheless.If you are concerned about it being too big, don't be. IMO, if you are at least 8-10 feet away from the screen you will not be overwhelmed. We have two chairs that are 6-8 feet away and our friends did not feel over-whelmed when watching a movie at all. In fact, the size is what we love. It makes viewing things like web pages SO much easier on our eyes.This is like having a projector / screen in your living room. The picture is incredible, the features are amazing and size really sucks you into the viewing experience. This unit is EXPENSIVE, but it really is worth the money if you can swing it. One of the best purchases we've ever made, and we have just about every popular gadget on the market. About the only knock is that the built-in software is a bit rudimentary and slow, so using the Sharp apps is somewhat under-whelming. For us, it didn't matter that much since we have a PC, Tivo and XBOX connected to the TV and can use them when needed. Other that that, this is a 5-star purchase for sure.(TIP: For PC users, check out the Silicon Dust Home Run device. It allows you to stream your cable TV signal to any PC, Mac or Linux machine in your house. For us, we use it to watch / record TV through Window Media Center. Last tip ... pair it with a $16 CE Compass remote control for Media Center, and I'm telling you ... you will be in for a treat.)Enjoy, and God bless.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Top Notch, all around", "Author": "Suckerpunch Sweetface", "ReviewID": "R27OLI31O76P1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered through Amazon, Via Huppins retail, and delivered by Yellow Freight.

The size of this TV when viewed from 12 foot is just perfect.  I was a little nervous of it being too big, but it is not.  I would have been disappointed with a smaller TV.  It does require some calibration and turning off some of the picture enhancers, but it can be tuned to deliver excellent color.  It probably won't be calibrated correctly at a store (Best Buy's was horrible), so it might not look great there.  The black levels are close to the absolute best I have ever seen.  The black levels in scenes can make it so there is no differentiation between the surrounding bezel and the screen.  For some reason the black bars on movies are a bit lighter than the black it will deliver in an actual scene (don't quite get why).  I have a high end Panasonic 58\" plasma that has way worse black levels even in THX mode and CNET raved about its black levels.The price is high but worth it. Paid $3,797 plus tax at my local Best Buy with a price match done for another local dealer that had them on clearance.  Didn't trust getting something this big online (no offense Amazon as I love you).  I know it doesn't have 3D, but it didn't matter to me as I rather hate 3D.  Even theater 3D gives me a headache.  The standard speakers are a bit weak, but are kind of standard for TV speakers.  Another great thing is the matt screen doesn't have as much reflection of light as the shiny ones, yet doesn't diminish the picture at night.  I usually watch at night, but this TV is even great in a very sunny room that really washed my plasmas out.  I typically watch movies and scripted TV shows.

The rest of the game is great as well as many other games.  It is big...so be prepared to sit a little further back (a couple feet is fine) verses a 55\" or 60\".  We can also recommend the ROKU.

I love it.  It is big, bold and bright.  The colors and black levels are great.  I would recommend this TV to my friends and relatives.  I like to watch sports and will say that in watching baseball sometimes there is a little streak when the ball flies across the screen.  I'm not sure what that is called but I did see other reviews that mentioned this too.  It isn't a big problem and I think I am the only one in my family that even notices it as I'm pretty picky when it comes to clarity of the picture etc.  My wife is wonderful and lets me have whatever toys I want and this one is a big toy.  We also bought a high end full surround sound system from a local retailer and had them install that.  The combination of the sound system and the TV makes a super home theater experience.  We have our furniture arragned in an L shape with the sofa at a 90 degree angle from the TV and two recliners facing the TV. The closest end of the sofa is only a few feet from the TV and off to the side and even from there, which is the least desireable spot, the TV is great.  From the other positions the picture is super.  The recliners sit about 9-11 feet from the television and that seems just perfect.Again, the experience with Huppens was great.  The box did have a hole in it when it arrived on the truck.  The driver (Yellow Frieght) was concerned about it and showed it to me.  It appeared to be in a cavity in the box and protected by the packaging.  He helped me unpack it on the driveway to make certain that there was no damage.  Then he even helped me bring it in the house even though I only paid for curb side delivery.  The bottom line is that the driver from Yellow, the packaging from Sharp and the customer service from Huppins all worked to perfection.  I had never ordered anything as major as this, in size or price, before on line and was pretty worried, but it all worked out great.  Don't fear, it will be okay if you order this through Amazon.  Don't worry.Really great buying experience and a really great product - FANTASTIC!Updated review 1 year after purchase -> I have now had this TV for about a year and still love it every day.

He is right on the mark, and has always been very helpful in all respects!I would also like to point out that this particular model was actually delivered to me 2 weeks back, but the delivery guys screwed the stand on incorrectly, therefore, the tv leaned forward from the left and was crooked on the side! I got a brand new replacement today from the retailer I do business with on a regular basis, and I am very, very pleased! Thanks!Warranty Info: This tv comes with a 1 year standard warranty which includes parts and labor. Now, if you register your tv on the official Sharp website, you will get an extra 3 months warranty. I bought a 3 year plan on their website for 180.00 plus they add on the extra 15 months, hence giving you 51 months of full warranty. The big retail stores are charging 800.00 for a 4 year plan, a rip off, I'm sorry to say! It's always best to do your homework in advance if you want to save some serious money.Update: March 5, 2013... I hooked it up to the internet and getting connected to Netflix was a snap.

I thouht my eyes were shot. After doing some research, I found out its the \"film mode\" which is turned on by default. It supposed to make it look a bit cleaner. Which it does ,but it loses the cinema feel. Luckily you can turn that off. Althogh for documentaries and some movies, I do like to poke around with the \"film mode\" It does give the movie a totally different feel.If you're a gamer, you're going to be in heaven. I recommend going to the \"game\" picture. I think the refresh rate is higher because if I go to like Dynamic or standard, you're going to notice a slight delay. And for most games, you might want to just stick with \"game\"  there is no delay. For my PC, I keep it on Game too. I have a ton of games and again, with a delay, that's not good for gamers. So just make sure you got it on \"game\". The dynamic pic is probably better and prettier on the eyes, but Game is no slacker, so don't worry.The contorller is simple to use, the picture is great and I don't regret this purchase at all. The best 80 inch TV can be yours!

The $1,500 Bose's speaker bar is connected to the TV by a optical fiber cable. I can correct the bad channels movement with analog wires from the Comcast HD box to a wireless head speaker set.

I currently had the bottom of the line Samsung 55\" LED in the room, and was excited for such a great upgrade. Unfortunately the flagship Sharp has nowhere near the picture quality of the bottom of the line Samsung. Here are some problems:1. Colors are horrible. I have calibrated the screen according to settings posted on avsforum.com and it has greatly improved the color compared to how it came stock, but nowhere near as good as the old samsung.2. Backlighting is super uneven. Darker and lighter splotches are all over the tv. When I pull up just a plain white screen it looks like a marble pattern. So distracting and horrible.3. Motion is blurry and annoying.The television is huge, the picture quality is awful, the build quality feels super cheap and the whole product feels rushed and shoddy. I am going to return this TV and get something from Sony or Samsung.
