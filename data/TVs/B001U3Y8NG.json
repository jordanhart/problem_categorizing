The downsides are Samsung's incompetent quality control that allowed this product to ship unassembleable, and their atrocious customer service that won't fix the problem.This set includes a base with pre-drilled holes that are too small for the included screws. I called customer service and they said they would send new screws, but they never did (it's been almost three weeks), and I'm not going to follow up with them because I've already solved the problem on my own.I'm posting this review so that people won't have to let those downsides keep them from buying and enjoying this fine television. If you buy this set, and plan attach the included base rather than mount it on a wall, you will need to purchase 4 #6-32 x 3/4\" machine screws to attach the guide stand to the stand.

Gray", "ReviewID": "R9XS52CVI7MFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Samsung LCD LN32B650 a few days.  I will write more after I have it six months but I have checked everything out and have found absolutely nothing to complain about in regards to the TV.  You will note this 2009 model has some significant upgrades from the 2008 model.  The picture is awesome!One thing I did not like was paying over $1100 for a 32 inch LCD but if you check the specifications are top notch so it probably is worth it.  Watching the action in the NCAA games the motion shots are perfect.  Not related directly to the TV but the manual is an E-Manual and it comes on a USB drive you plug into the TV.  I can not load it on my computer very successfully as the software is looking for commands from the TV remote and not the computer so I can not naviagate through the e-manual very well so I can't print it out.  It is personal preference but I don't care that much for e-manuals when I can't print them out.  I like to be able to read a manual and make notes while I am trying things.  I understand why companies do it but I don't have to like it.  The other issue with an E-Manual is you can only see it on the TV and if you are having issues with the TV you may well not be able to look at the manual for help.  This is a Samsung issue and has nothing to do with the TV.  They do have telephone and e-mail help which I never needed but one does have that option.  The Samsung web site has a lot of good FAQ's.  One tricky thing for the wife and I on installation was a cover that came with it that took us a long time to figure out where it goes.  The fact is if you use the table stand which we did you don't use it.  It is to cover that hole if you do a wall mount.There are all kinds of video and audio setting which I have not used as I just could not ask for a nicer picture.  We got the TV going with the Quick guide which is not bad.  We had some questions about some setting that were answered in the E-manual.  I really made no changes to them after reading the manual.  We do not have a Blue Ray but it appears there are some setting that would enhance watching a DVD played on a Blue Ray.  The remote is very intuitive for the wife and I.  The huge number of I/O's on the TV is awesome.  We used one of the HDMI inputs with a 1.3 cable which should give the best quality.  We are using a dishnetwork VIP 622 which also lets us use the OTA antenna hooked to the VIP 622 and puts those channels in the program guide.  The OTA as well as Satellite HD looks great. Also the SD looks excellent.  I have heard a lot about how bad SD looks but so far we have been most please with the SD channels.  Some of this may have to do with the 32' size and might not look as great on a 52\" model.", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poor Samsung can't see the picture", "Author": "L.", "ReviewID": "R1571L3JKR9G0Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Received this beautiful television but could not use it for three weeks because Samsung put the wrong parts in the box.

I hooked a Blu Ray up and it gives excellent detail.  The 120HZ feature is excellent for fast moving action items.  The sound from the TV is good but I may add an amplifier and speakers later.  It is a TV for the bedroom and I was not planning on adding speakers to it originally.  I have a 50\" Samsung Plasma with theater sound in the living room and have gotten spoiled with that.I just purchased this TV set and tried putting the stand together yesterday. I read the comments previously posted and thought okay, if I have the same issue, no problem. I placed my TV on the stand and the screw holes were not lined up properly. I got my mag-lite out and checked and the holes were not even close. I then determined why - the TV does not sit far enough down on the stand because the back part of the TV which is notched out for the stand is not notched out far enough for the stand supplied. There is a metal frame part on the bottom of the TV where the stand should rest but it does not. I could get it to work by making the notched out area in the TV to go up a small amount but it is a new TV and not to ready to make \"home adjustments\" yet. I called Samsung and they said they will send me another stand. I mentioned to the rep that appears to be a common problem for this TV. So, I will wait a week or so for the possible right stand to arrive (which I am not too positive it will be any different). I will add more later as the saga continues.The Guidestand that came with the TV had LN640-32 and BN61-04992X if you have those numbers you have the wrong part. The new one that arrived today had LN650-32 and BN61-04812X stamped on it. I took the Guidestand part and placed it on the stand and the TV fit perfectly in place to get the screws to work.

I probably couldn't go back to 60Hz after playing my PS3 on this TV.  I dare you to watch a Blu-Ray on this TV in a properly lit room and not be stunned.  The only minor thing I don't like are the buttons on the TV (power, volume and channel) are almost invisible.  They're heat-sensitive buttons on the bottom right of the TV you slide your finger across, but you need to be in a extremely bright room to see what you're actually pressing.  The labeling of those buttons should glow in the dark.

This replaces a 20-year-old Sony XBR, and is my first flatscreen, so maybe my small problems are caused by inexperience.  The delivery was first class; two people brought it into my house and set it up for me and made sure it worked.I use it to watch satellite tv, dvd's, and for streaming with a Roku box.  The Roku movies are much better looking on this tv than on the old Sony.  I like being able to use different sound options for different purposes and being able to adjust the picture according to use.There is a very annoying chime that automatically plays when one turns the set on and off, and I can't figure out how to shut that sound off.  It's much louder than the volume that I play the tv, and I'm afraid it will wake someone sleeping in the next room.It would be very nice to be able to use headsets to help me hear all the dialog without turning up the volume too loud, but I don't see a place to plug in headsets, and I've read that wireless headsets don't work well with digital sound.Forget trying to contact Samsung's mis-named customer service.

Would have been 5 days except for the storm they had back east. It came double boxed with air filled packets as packing material. Some of the packets had popped resulting in some movement of the inside box but there was no damage. UPS dropped it off on my front door and I didn't have to sign anything. The whole thing weighed about 40lbs so one person could move and set this up easily.The stand is heavy duty high tempered glass with red tinge in front. Very heavy it allows the TV to swivel left and right by loosening two screws from underneath. A plastic guide holder screwed on with 4 screws perfectly to the glass stand.(I think previous issues with regard to this has been resolved by Samsung). The TV then screwed on to the plastic guide holder with an additional 4 screws making it very secure. There is absolutely no excessive movement from the TV. You could secure the TV to wall or cabinet with a included holder but this is optional.The TV front had a subtle red Touch of Color which really only comes out in direct light. The screen is not overly glossy and I had no problems with excessive reflections.The TV turned on and was easily setup using plug and play within 15mins. Should be noted that the TV takes about 5 seconds to turn on with a startup melody. The TV Menu has explanations of what each feature does on the bottom which was very helpful. It does comes with 150+ paper manual half english half spanish so you could easily look up things. The TV turned off instantenously with a quick shutdown melody.The sound which I expected to suck was surprisingly good. The speakers are downward firing and I don't know if my having the TV enclosed in a armoire is helping amplify it. I have it on SRS TruSurround for now but I think anybody with Blu-ray hooked up will certainly be looking at a surround sound setup.(You'd be stupid not to)I hooked up my cable(NPGCable) to it directly and was impressed with how good it looked with standard definition TV. My normal viewing distance from my bed is about 10-11ft away but even closer the picture was good. The free HDTV that I was receiving was even better. I used the built in tuner to memorize all the available channels. Digital channels I noted takes just a little longer to come up when I flip channels then the standard ones. I will at a later date probably hook up my cable box to it via HDMI.Right now I have my PS3 hooked up to it on HDMI1 and Blu-ray movies were stunning. There was no ghosting or discernible motion artifact. Picture was bright, vivid with very black blacks. My PS3 upscaled my ordinary DVDs and it's a new experience. I played BioShock and there was absolutely no problems, lags or artifact that I could detect. Perfect for gaming. There was no delay in switching to different Source from TV mode and I heard no audio pops or noise.I registered the TV online using the web address on the front of the paper manual and the site says it was manufactured 11/30/2009. I found no need for any sort of firmware upgrade at this time.I had looked at the Sony Bravia 32XBR9 which is selling for about $599 for quite a while. This Samsung maintained it's high price for a very long time dropping to about $799 before Christmas. When it dropped to $679 I pulled the trigger and I would encourage people to not dither and get it NOW if they are interested.I heard about Samsungs dying in 6 months I hope this is not the case. It's a gorgeous set and highly recommended.Thanks to AMAZON and to everybody's reviews and comments.

We lost the sound on HDTV broadcasts after trying out the game console, but noticed when the sound was lost, the picture was much improved. (?!?!) Swapping the cable to the other HDMI ports brought back the sound, and the picture remained much better than previously reported.  The downside is this set now has to either be returned to Amazon or sent to Samsung.  I'm going to ask Amazon to take it back and replace it.  I'll update this review in the next few days...Update 2 (1/3/10): I received the replacement HDTV, and it had major scuffs on the bottom bezel!  Couldn't believe it.  The protective plastic that this set ships with on the bezel was missing on the lower portion, and appeared to come from the factory like that.  Unfortunately there were 3 major scuffs on the bezel due to this, and caused me to make yet another call to Amazon.  Amazon shipped a 3rd HDTV to me, and this one arrived undamaged and is working as it should so far.  Keeping my fingers crossed!Original review:I've had this set for about 10 days, and as a user who is mostly using it for broadcast television viewing, I'm mildly impressed.  Picture quality is pretty good in most circumstances, but suffers from the same issues that affect HD broadcasts - motion is juttery in certain specific circumstances (fast motion with fine detail in the picture).Using this TV with a Time Warner Cable HD box & HDMI cable (supposedly the best quality input for TV viewing), I've noticed the following:- Standard TV output on this set, like other LCD TVs, is of slightly less quality than a good performing CRT TV. This will only be of concern to those who still need to rely on non-HD channels for some of their viewing.- The speakers on this TV leave a lot to be desired.  They are downward firing, and have no bass to them.  The sound is very tinny, and really needs an add-on sound system to correct this, which bumps the cost of this TV up even further.  Going into the audio menu and choosing \"Movie\" for the audio output alleviates this somewhat.- Still pictures or portions of broadcasts without much action/motion are pretty crisp compared to a standard def TV, but when there is motion involved with a live sporting event broadcasting in 720p, it degrades quickly when fine detail is being displayed. 1080i sporting events look much cleaner, but still show some motion issues. Commercials with motion don't seem that bad - but who buys a TV for commercials?  The 720p motion causes all sorts of unintended visual elements to appear, which is surprising considering this set supposedly has \"blazing fast 4ms response time\" and \"Auto Motion Plus 120Hz\" features.  Perhaps as broadcasters continue to upgrade their systems, this will improve, but for now it still seems like the industry is immature and this TV won't magically overcome these issues.- The included stand wobbles slightly when attached to the TV (play of about 1/8\" side-to-side).  This TV has some heft to it, and it is supported on a single post that simply snaps into the bottom of the set, and then has 4 screws you install to secure the post.  The screws lined up fine for me unlike other reviewers report, but I found you really couldn't tell when they were fully tight - they went in with much effort from the start - so that I ended up stripping at least one of them, and then knew enough to be very careful with the other 3. The TV isn't exactly rock-solid on this skinny single shaft.  If anyone walks in the room, the TV rocks ever so slightly, mostly side to side. This problem of course will be dependent on how stiff your floors are.  What I found odd is the set comes with a shoestring on a small black plastic triangular attachment.  If you don't mount the TV on the wall, then you are supposed to attach this triangle with the shoestring to the back of the TV, and then you are supposed to drill a screw (not included) into the piece of furniture you plan on setting the TV on top of, and then tie the loose end of the string on the screw to help prevent the TV from tipping over. So it's basically anchoring the TV from the top back of the set.  That doesn't give me a lot of confidence, in that Samsung apparently lacks confidence in their own base to keep the TV upright and stable.  It also seems to be a real contrast in design details for a company that took the time to put such a trivial styling touch as a thin line of injected red plastic on the face plate, but then tosses in an afterthought piece like an ugly piece of gray string as part of the stability of the set.  Weird, and it definitely smells of cost containment.- The \"buttons\" on the front of the set leave me scratching my head.  Looking at the set out of the box, I had no idea there were \"buttons\" on the front - the bezel is completely smooth and solid.  Then I saw references to them in the manual, but looked for them and couldn't see them.  It was only when I angled my view to create a glare on the front trim that I could see the outlines of control labels.  They are touch activated, so they aren't raised in anyway, and to keep the front looking \"clean\" (with the exception of the large \"SAMSUNG\" logo printed on the front), apparently Samsung has chosen to not put legible lettering on them, nor to light them when the TV is plugged in.  Granted, most people will be using the remote, but it doesn't seem like a well thought out detail.  You'll also end up touching them unintentionally if you attempt to move the set by grabbing the bezel.- This is probably more a personal preference, but the volume indicator on screen doesn't really appeal to me.  Rather than the normal bars that would appear to grow or shrink across the bottom of the screen, Samsung has a circular indicator, which starts at the 12 noon position, then goes clockwise around, accompanied by numbers from 0 to 100 (25 at the 3 o'clock position, 50 at the 6 o'clock position, etc).  This plays mind games with me as I'm clicking the volume button up while the indicator on the screen goes down for the first half of the range - it seems to be counter-intuitive, and I find myself questioning whether I'm pressing the button in the right direction each time I'm going to adjust the volume.  I didn't see anyone else mention this, so it might be just a personal quirk.- Out of curiosity I hooked up this TV to the Internet via an ethernet cable.  I tried a firmware update over the Internet, but it error'd out with a code of \"connection failed (102)\". I did run the network connection diagnostics available on the set, and they came back as successful.  Googling on this error message provides many hits of people having the same issue, and even some complaints of Samsung's firmware versions not being well managed by Samsung.  I found this to be the case, as Samsung lists on their website an earlier version as the latest for this set, but when I query the version using the TV's menu, it reports it is a newer version, one revision higher than what is listed as the newest on the web.-DVD playback has been fine.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player, but DVDs don't seem to suffer from this issue with motion like live TV does. I've only played some Adult Swim cartoon DVD collections, so I'm not sure I've really tested it well.-The PS2 I have works fine on the set.  The images aren't that great - similar to standard TV - but it's OK for game play.-I do like the set from the perspective of the connection types available on the back.  There are plenty of options and it allows for many different setup options.  The connections are all biased to the right side of the TV (as you watch it). That's a bit inconvenient for me as my cables all need to run from the left.  You just need an additional foot or 2 of cable length to overcome it.  Power cable attaches to the left hand side of the TV (as you watch it), and is angled 90 degrees to the right, so if you need to run the power cable back to the left, you'll have to twist it back 180 degrees.Just keeping my fingers crossed I'm not one of the unlucky few who experience the dreaded \"dead set\" problem eventually...", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great LCD TV but it's no CRT HDTV", "Author": "Mr. Green Thumb", "ReviewID": "R12TNMNEU7GH8N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I had lasik surgery a few years ago and just had a check up recently and the doctor said I have 20/15 vision in both eyes. With that said, I have the ability to see details that are unable to be seen by most people.I had the same problem as some other reviewers about installing the screen to the base mount. First, you have to install the plastic piece onto the base, then the screen slides down the guide. At first, I thought of the same thing, wrong screws. But when I took my bright mag-lite and shined it in there, I saw that the pre-drilled holes didn't lined up. I couldn't push the screen down any further for the them to line up. Two of them went in ok but the other two couldn't even catch. The only way you can get them in is screw at an angle until the first few threads catched on, then you finish tightening them. If you are not confident enough, get somebody to help you. If you strip the thread on the screw or the mounting hole, you're gonna have to modify to make it fit or go out to hardware store and buy some pointed tip screws. By the way, the included screws have bolt-like thread but slightly tapered. I had to put in a lot of force and used the exact size phillips head screwdriver to get them in. Screw them in each a little at a time. They're in and that's it. I don't plan to take them apart when I need to move. What seemingly looked like a simple job took me over an hour to accomplished.I bought this locally because I didn't want to deal with returns in case of damages during transit. So far, I had it for about two months, made sure that I know everything about it before writing a review. I bought this model and brand because I had experiences in another high definition tv that I bought a few years ago, Samsung TX-P2675WH 26\" Widescreen HDTV. Once I knew how to use the remote to access all the features on the 26\", learning the new remote on this LCD was fairly quick. I haven't had the need to plug in the USB flash card to the TV to read the instruction manual.The remote and on screen menu is easy to use. Menu, Left, Right, Up, Down, and middle round button as Enter to navigate to most features, and they're from left to right. The lighted keypad can be turned off to save the batteries but I wish it uses 2 AA instead of 2 AAA. It is very responsive and has a great range but my living room is very small so I can't tell how much further than 20 feet it can operate. The button feel is precise and resilient, not dull and flat like my other remote. They are strategically laid out and protruding from an elegant and glossy piano black face plate. All the features are on the remote but what I like the most about it is the Channel List feature. It's like a tv guide and the button is CH LIST under the VOL. I'm using it with rooftop antenna with a pre-amp and an amp so I know the signal is perfect. You can read my other reviews to see my setup. Let's say you're on channel 8. You press Channel List button and the station name is highlighted WFAA. Press the Right button and the current show is highlighted. If you press the Info button, it will describe the show in details. Press the Return button to go back one step or Exit to completely leave the Menu. When you're at where the current show is highlighted, you can click the Down button to see future shows. The only drawback is that it can only list shows up to 12 hours in advance. You can have it set on timer viewing for future shows. If you have it on different channel at that time, it will automatically switch over, but if the tv is off, it will turn on to that station. You don't have to go through extensive steps to see the details of current show. Simply press the Info button and it will show that with the basics like station ID, current date & time, program length and green status bar, broadcast sound, broadcast resolution (480i, 720p, or 1080i), aspect ratio, next program name, and most importantly, program description. It only shows two lines so if the description is longer, you can press the Down button to see the remaining. Bear in mind that sometimes the description is blank and says either DTV Program or No Title. It's not necessarily the tv and it could be the station. In that case, wait a few minutes and press the Channel List button to see if the name of the program is there. The name of the program and the descriptions usually received at the same time. The Tools button is like a shortcut to some popular features like HDMI, picture mode, sound mode, sleep time, SRS HD, add to favorite, and switch to cable. Believe it or not, the remote on this tv works on my other samsung and vice versa. There are only a few features that are designed exclusively for their model but the rest work perfectly. I would, however, use this remote because it's much more responsive.One thing that it doesn't have under info is the signal strength. My Channel Master converter box CM-7000 has it under info. With this TV, I would have to go to Menu, Support, Self-Diagnostic, Signal Strength to see it (thanks to user \"Indiana Opera Buff\" for the info). My rooftop antenna is pointing toward about 223 degree southwest where most of the towers are at but there are a few stations that shows perfect 9 bars signal on my other samsung but this TV sometimes has glitches, about one second, even with perfect 10 bars signal. My guess is that these stations are somewhere else in the metroplex so I would have to point the antenna toward it plus they're not transmitting a full signal.When I first bought my other Samsung back in early 2005, I was able to pick up about 30 channels, both digital and analog. As of September 1st, 2009, I am able to receive 52 DTV channels and 6 analog channels in the Dallas area. There are about 10 Spanish speaking channels for those who prefer. FOX is the only major network that broadcast in 720p instead of 1080i. NBC has 3 channels, NBC1 in HD, NBC2 WeatherPlus, and NBC3 Sports. NBC Sports has recent reruns like Swimming & Diving, Track & Field, Cycling, etc. ABC also has 3 channels, ABC1 in HD, ABC2 Weather/Headline news, and ABC3 local traffic. CBS11 doesn't have sub-channels but it has a sister station on KTXA21. They share and alternate programs, both broadcast in HD. New channels are added occasionally so you should rescan the tuner every week or two to be able to view them. Even PBS has PBS1 and PBS2. Digital transmission is very expensive compare to the old analog signal so that's why some low budget stations have disappeared. There was a free 24 hours music channel a few years ago that went away, then another one popped up over a year later but recently has ceased their transmission. To be able to see the total number of channels that I am receiving, I can press Channel List, Info, and it will show the number of DTV, air, and favorite channels.The pixel pitch on the screen is very fine.  Using my 10x loupe, I could see the RGB; red, green, and blue vertical lines from left to right. They're too small to count but using the listed 1920x1080 resolution with 1920 as vertical lines and 27.5\" as the width of the screen, I would say the approximately 70 lines per inch is fairly accurate, considering the red, green, and blue pixels make one line. I would guess the pixel pitch is about one third the size compare to my other Samsung. Watching both side by side, this one has much more detail, contrast, and sharpness. The black level is almost too dark, like if somebody is wearing a black blazer. It's almost too overwhelming and I find my perfect viewing distance is about 16' away. I don't believe the recommended screen guide and I think that they want you to buy the biggest tv that you can afford. Bigger screen only gives you farther viewing distance and not better picture. You are still gonna have the same number of lines of resolution, 1920x1080.This tv lacks the consistency that my other Samsung has. I think it's resolution dependence. Shows that broadcast in 1080i are clear and vibrant most of the time but older shows and movies are kinda dull and hazy. Watching local news broadcast in 1080i and 720p, I can clearly see the dot crawl. It's more prounounced with 720p. I think it's the digital comb filter that needs major improvement. Watching the closeup, above the waist shot of the news-person, you can clearly see their hair light up like a christmas tree. I'm suspecting the dark and shiny part of their hair is highly contrasted and the pixels are close together that the tv can't compensate. You can also see this imperfection on any highly contrasted and closed together pixels like certain clothing patterns. Earlier versions of LCD TVs had sort of metallic picture and very dark, dark scenes but this TV has overcome such improvement. However, these flaws are still visible on occasions. When it change from bright scene to dark scene, you can actually see the transition. It goes from bright to dark, to dark some more. You might have to get closer to the screen to read the credits at the end of a movie.I had one reader asked me if the dot crawl that I had described is haloing effect. The answer is no, it's not a glow around the object. When I said \"light up like a christmas tree\", I simply meant \"non-simultaneous blinking lights\". I don't know the best way or technical term to describe it but I would say it's \"extreme pixel flickering\". It's most visible during live local news and worst with FOX4NEWS that broadcast in 720p. I don't know if it's the indoor spotlighting that they use inside the studio or if it's something else. I'm gonna try to play around with it some more to see if I can reduce the effect. I hope that helped.They were showing the movie Revenge with kevin costner the other day and the indoor scenes looked like it's filled with smoke or fog. Samsung LCD HDTVs use Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp backlights to give you 92 percent coverage of the NTSC standard, ensuring truer, more breathlessly vivid colors. What they don't tell you is that LCD can't produce accurate pure white light as CRT. When you break down pure white light, you get 3 main colors, RGB, red, green, and blue. If you add different mixtures and intensity of each, you'll get any other colors in between. Each one has a level of 0 to 255, or 256 possible settings of each, so you get a possibility of over 16.7 million colors, which is about what a normal human eye can see. What I'm trying to say is LCD technology is still fairly new and can't produce 16.7 million colors. The small subtlety can only be seen if viewing side by side with a CRT HDTV like I did so this shouldn't affect your buying decision, not to mention that they stopped making CRT HDTVs a few years ago. If you prefer color accuracy over details, contrast, and sharpness, I'm sure you can find used CRT HDTVs via local ads, newspapers, or craigslist. The deep contrast and the fine pixel pitch of this LCD steer viewers away from knowing any difference. Another thing that I need to mention is since it's Fluorescent Lamp based, like those ice cream cone light bulbs, it requires a few minutes to achieve full brightness.I haven't used the Picture in Picture feature but I think you need to have 2 different video sources. I have the rooftop antenna to the coaxial input and a dvd player to the composite input and can't get it to work. It's under Menu, Setup, but it's grayed out which means it's not an option. Too bad it's doesn't have a dual digital tuner. It only has 1 coax input so later on if I want to subscribe to cable service, I'll have to get a diplexer or something to combine the signals. I don't know if that's gonna work and if the tv will be able to distinguish the difference between tv and cable signal. Do they even use coaxial for cable or you'll have to use their box and connect it to one of the other inputs like component and hdmi?The sound is ok and plenty loud but like others said, it lacks bass. It also sounds tunnel-like compare to my other Samsung. I would prefer the speakers on the sides and forward firing instead of inside bottom firing. Sometimes the sound get distorted and I think it's because the speakers are cheaply made, 1.75\" by 5\" 2-way paper cone woofers. It's adequate but I'll probably buy a center channel unit large enough for this to sit on. Also, if I'm in another room, I could hear the hissing sound at the end of every vocal sentence.After playing around with it for two months, this is the best setting for my viewing. Picture mode: standard, Backlight: 8, Contrast: 60, Brightness: 40, Sharpness: 60, Color: 20, Tint: G47 R53, Black Tone: darkest, Dynamic Contrast: low. Everything else I set them at default, even 120hz is off. I couldn't really tell the difference between on and off on the settings of Auto Motion Plus and Edge Enhancement. Maybe it's only effective during certain scenes. I also like to point out that sometimes the picture look jittery during fast action but if you look closely, the camera is panning or on the move so it could be the Electronic Image Stablization issue. The Dynamic Contrast brightened the whole thing so I had to lowered everything else down otherwise it hurts my eyes. Like I said before, the picture is kinda hazy sometimes and turning on the Black Tone to Darkest fixed most of the problem but didn't completely eliminate it. The haziness is more visible when the camera zoomed out of the action or during dark scene. I think it's the characteristic of the backlight technology associated with the LCD type TV. I find that setting the Black Tone to Dark instead of Darkest get the perfect balance between trying to eliminate haze and high black level. I usually have to bump up the Backlight setting to 9 when I watch movies, especially if it has a lot of dark scenes.To sum it up, would I recommend this TV? Yes Definitely! It doesn't get perfect 5 star because it can't display dark scenes very well. I have to say that this imperfection bothers me the most. One moment I tell myself \"WOW\" and the next moment I go \"ARGH\". Watching \"Alien Resurrection\" bring as much frustration as enjoyment. If you watch mostly sports then you're gonna love this. 2010 Winter Olympics is coming up in February 12th to the 28th for those who are so inclined besides myself. It also lack consistent clarity compare to my CRT HDTV but it made up in small pixel pitch for clear detail. I've done a lot of research and this one has better picture and features than cheaper brands and models. It's a little pricier than others, but like everything else, you get what you paid for. I would rather save money from eating out less than buying something that I might regret later. I don't have a Blu-Ray player but after watching shows in 1080i like CSI Miami and CSI NY, I have an idea how spectacular it would look. With deep color, contrast, and low response time, I would think this make a great tv for playing video games. One of the best thing that I like about this new model is the 4ms response time. With earlier models, I could clearly see the pixelation during fast action. With this model, it's still visible but on a rare occasion, right on par with my CRT HDTV. Right now, this is the best 32\" LCD TV out there.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "My first HD Flat Screen", "Author": "I. Leon", "ReviewID": "RIR5A88P2UZRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my first ever HD Flat Screen TV a couple of months ago. After plenty of research decided for this Samsung LN32B650. At the beginning I had no idea what to look for, didn't understand very well what was important to have on a TV nowadays and what was useless to pay for. Reviews from people helped me allot and that's why I decided to write one.Aesthetically this TV is stylish with smooth curves and simple. No buttons showing on the front, no holes for plugs or anything, just simply a red light showing when the TV is on. Overall, very slick. At first I was worried about the red touch of color being too much by judging the pictures but when I got the TV I was pleased to find that is very subtle.After asking friends and professionals on different electronic stores I decided for this combination of 1080p 120HZ 80,000:1. I believe it is worth paying a bit more for something that is still going to be up to date and good in a near future. It was only a couple hundred dollars more to get a better TV so I did so, sacrificing the size. I live on a small apartment in NYC so 32 inches for me is more than enough so I focused on the quality more than the size.Other things I was looking for on a TV was, keeping it under my $1000 budget, availability of HDMI outlets, audio, USB ports, and PC input, which this TV included and compared to others it surpassed. I was preparing myself to be able to connect pretty much anything I wanted without having to disconnect one and connect the other, no hassle. With 4 HDMI connections you have plenty of stuff you can connect at the same time, your Xbox, blue ray, vhs, cable box, etc.Quality of picture is great. I managed to sort of calibrate it myself without professional help and I am very happy with it. You do have to spend sometime in the menu choosing different types of tones, picture, color, specially on the mode and picture options. The Mode and Picture options really define the kind of picture you want to look at and you will have to play with it back and forth until you achieve your goal. What I like about the menu is that any change you do you can see immediately, it helps to figure out what real change happens when you choose that option without the need to exit the menu options. Menu is very straight forward and easy to use but there are many options that I didn't understand until I clicked on them and learned the effect, great!Overall great TV and very happy with the price. I researched other brands, even some that I never heard before, some where cheaper but decided to go with one that is well known to be of quality like Samsung. I have friends that have payed for cheaper TVs assuming that it was ok and that they didn't care too much about the quality but end up either returning it or frustrated. Love the TV and have to add that is very easy to install, it looks great in our living room.", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Packaging Includes the Wrong Screws for Installing the 32\" TV stand", "Author": "Gammaxray \"TheRay\"", "ReviewID": "R39VZECELTNDOZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The packaging includes 8 screws for installing the screen onto its LCD TV Stand assembly which includes the(1)the base Stand; and (2)the Guide Stand, which is a metal form that sits on the base Stand, and it serves to assist in the pivoting the screen. The screen mounts on this interface Guide Stand. However, the factory packaging includes the wrong size screws : Too big, making it impossible to screw them into the predrilled holes of these 3 units.( The included assembly instructions specifies that the Samsung 32\" LCD stand requires 4 special screws: Another Amazon user had similar problem on different Samsung 32\" model in the L32B5 series.) Anyway,I promptly called customer service, and they said they would send me replacements and asked me to call again for tracking. I called 3 days later, and they referred me to the repair service rep. This rep (first name started with 'J') was irritated that I called, and said I would have to wait 7 to 14 business days, and he rebuked me for calling so soon after my first call. He evidently thought I was very impatient, even tho I was most courteous. He was just plain rude. It is now 8 days since my first call, and no word yet. I am disgusted with the Factory for giving me the wrong screws, and I can't find the proper screws at my local hardware store. I really think the pre-drilled holes in the stand are too small, and possibly off center, so they don't sync with the other pre-drilled holes on the Guide Stand, or the screen.

I'm not a picture fanatic, and my eyesight is failing, so normally I dont' notice these things.  Far superior to the SONY's I've had.  The picture is so sharp and crisp I'm going to have to do a bit of research because I'm curious how Samsung manages it.ToC.  I was a bit concerned if the red ToC would be distracting.  One reviewer stated it was subtle, and that may be overstating it.  You probaly will only notice the ToC in the showroom, or when you're unpacking it.  It's not at all noticeable or distracting when viewing.I only have a few minor annoyances:1) There is no users manual included, only a quick start guide.  The only way you can get a printed manual is buy one.  Two reasons I got from Samsung support where that they had gone \"green\" and most people don't read the manual anyway, with which I disagree.  Second was that it was too big to print.  Please! For $900 dollars I expect a dang manual.You can download a pdf manual from their web site.There is very nice interactive user manual on the included USB drive (would be nice if the zoom function worked there to read the small print).  But nothing in the packaging tells you it is on there...and their customer service doesn't seem to know it's there either.I'll give them points for including the USB drive.They do call their set plug 'n play, and it is pretty close to that.2) The picture settings seem a bit limited.  You have 16:9, 4:3, and a couple of zoom modes that don't seem very useful. In the two zoom modes you can move the picture up and down, but not side to side...not sure what those two modes are for.It defaults to 16:9.  On most sets, \"regular\" tv shows look a bit stretched and odd in 16:9,which I find annoying.  But somehow the Samsung seems to manage it in a tolerable manner.Warranty: I saw one reviewers comments on having to ship his 32\" to New Jersey at his expense, which certanly seems absurd. When you read Samsung's web site, the 32\" seems to fall in some undefined area.  They mention specifically the bigger sets and the smaller (25\") but its a bit confusing what applies to the 32\".  I called them and was assured there were other options besides shipping to NJ, that they would find a local repair company to handle it.Hopefully, I won't have to deal with that.  After dealing with the warranty replacement on the SONY I developed some opinions on the near worthless value of warranties vs the hassle factor.I would recommend to anyone who does have to deal Samsung about warranty issues that if the first thing they are told does not seem satisfactory, call back and talk to someone else or try to escalate it to a higher authority than basic customer support.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Broken after three years", "Author": "J", "ReviewID": "R39BRMKGGLIN90", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Maybe its just that I remember the old CRT televisions being passed down like family heirlooms, but three years for a $600+ 32 inch doesn't seem fair.

Still just using a regular old DVD player and pixelation is definitely visible up close but from sitting distance it is still vivid and GREAT! HD television through an antennae looks GREAT. I can't wait to see a blu-ray. I'm very optimistic about this purchase.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Nice", "Author": "Richard Berns \"Dick Berns\"", "ReviewID": "R30LSLU8FHGNTU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this TV Samsung LN37B650 37-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color. It is simple and smart with a high quality picture. The only setback for me was that I overlooked the importance of the connecting cable from our Comcast set top box to the TV. I bought, separately, a good HDMI cable (Monster brand) in order to assure the Hi Def quality of the picture.As secondary issues, the remote control has an impressive array of buttons and controls, and the fact that the volume control is indicated as an unobtrusive circle on the side of the picture is a nice feature.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "good but Needs more motion flow", "Author": "R.

I spent 20 minutes trying to get the closed captioning to work on a DVD that has closed captioning instead of subtitles, and just read in the manual that it only works in TV mode AND if you have a cable or satellite box, requires to set captioning on the box and not the TV.Being that the TV is not returnable once opened, I've wasted $800. It will be a long time before I buy a Samsung product again, which is a shame because I've really liked the company until nowAccording to the Americans With Disabilities act, all televisions with a screen larger than 13 inches to have a built in closed captioning decoder.On a better side of things the picture quality is great, but if you are hearing impaired, you might as well use this for watching silent films.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN32B650", "Author": "Standard Poodle", "ReviewID": "R1AUDGH3RLQZ5L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Product arrived in excellent condition within the expected time.The picture is sharp, clear and easy to see.
