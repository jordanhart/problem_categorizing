For the money it was a good buy.  Picture quality is very good, and the size of the tv fits nicely my needs.  The only criticism is with the sound output.  Sometimes you have to turn the volume up toward the maximum to hear clearly, but with the headphones this is not a big problem.  Easy to use and understand the manual.", "Date": "August 16, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1366 x 768 pixel resolution\n550:1 contrast ratio\n16:9 aspect ratio\n170?H/170?V viewing angle", "Name": "Sharp LC-15SH6U 15-Inch LCD TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411JRRZGSWL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000FRB5OS"}}
