Really easy set up and looks great with the blue-ray player.Some of the better features include:- A smart sound adjustment that keeps commercials from getting ridiculously loud.- Four different picture sizes to adjust for wide screen and standard TV.- Eco mode that isn't as bright and brilliant, but saves on power consumption.- Easy USB connect to view pics on the TV in a slide show format.- The screen itself is a sort of matte texture, so the chance of glare is reduced greatly.- Just about everything is customizable for Picture, Audio, Channel locking, etc. (especially if you get into advanced menus)Cons- The picture doesn't look all that awesome with normal TV, but that's just how they get you to buy the \"HD package\" I suppose.- The stand that the TV comes with is not adjustable at all!- The Vizio symbol stays lit even when the TV is off...

I think the HD channels look better on this $300 720p TV than my expensive 1080p plasma.Finally, the speakers on this TV are quite good.

Built in sleep timer, lots of ports, fairly easy-to-use remote control and light weight are all nice additional features. The only downside so far (one full day of ownership here) is the \"Vizio\" emblem on the front is lit up at all times whether the TV is off or on. Not a good idea if you like it dark in the room.

Thought I wanted a 40\" LCD and saw a great one at Costco for $599-the other TV that caught my eye was a Vizio 32\" and the sound was great.  Came home and used blue tape on  the wall to get idea of how new TV would fit & 40\" just bigger than I wanted even though per Amazon chart should get that size due to sitting 11\" away.  32\" better size so read reviews & TV I saw at Costco was Vizio e320VA but that one had more negative comments about sound and this one seems to be newer model  with better reviews & better contrast ratio. (If you are a Sam's Club member this TV is about $295 at Sams online-but I did not want to pay for a membership.)On to TV-so glad I read so many reviews.  Easy for one person to lift and set-up and Vizio packaging easy to open (read the box-you don't need to cut it open.) The menu to adjust sound, screen fit, and picture is intuitive and easy to use.  Love that they give you named sound and picture options to choose from so you don't have to tweek everything individually if you don't want to.  I too did not like the TruSurround & TruVolume features so went into the Audio Advanced settings & turned them off-got this tip from other reviews.  I have it plugged into a surge protector/power strip so when not using I power the whole thing off so not drawing any power and my settings are still there when I power it back on-who wants to pay for electricity when not watching the TV...? (Anything with a logo that glows or that has a remote draws a little power so you can turn it on with the remote-rather than unplugging it use a power strip with a switch & surge protection.)I have Standard Time Warner cable with no set-top box & I don't want to up-grade now & when scanned for channels the digital channels of local stations my old 20\" SDTV picked up are actually HD channels-so you may get some HD channels without having to change your service. Even the Standard Def channels look better!  Seems on older HDTVs and on bigger HDTVs others had problems with SD channels but SD channels look great on this TV (I have great long distance vision so it's not because I can't see that far away.) I also hooked up my 2005 Samsung DVD  player & looked great & then switched to component cable (red/blue/green) and even better (change your DVD settings if you do this)-Prince of Persia looked awesone!  I don't know what BlueRay or 1080p could add-the picture was fantastic and sound was very good.  Research I've read says that newer LCD TVs upconvert DVDs even without an upconverting DVD player.So the size for me is great (I did not want the TV to totally dominate my living room), the picture is fantastic (excellent contrast, color & definition), its also very good viewing at all angles & the non glare screen is great if sun coming through window.  The sound is great for me-I am not going to get a surround sound system but can see why someone might-but I don't need to feel explosions all around me, etc.What would I improve?  Add some glow in the dark buttons to the remote.Get it-you won't be sorry!  Amazon gives you 30 days to return it & free shipping-excellent.

Wireless keyboard setup? Can you say, Hulu?Also, the speakers are so much better compared to the regular 30\" box TV we had. they also don't blast backwards through the walls like the other did, so we can sleep when my girlfriend or I want to stay up later and watch something.Covering up the Vizio logo is recommended if that bothers you, but I kind of like it.The only con I can think of right now is the remote.

I recently got a new Samsung Galaxy S4 and was playing with the WatchOn (powered by Peel) app that comes with the phone which makes it a universal remote control.  I pressed a button in the OTA settings of WatchOn which briefly brought up a parental control screen on the Vizio TV, the TV then shutoff, and never turned on again. I couldn't believe that a universal remote could damage a TV so I tried to power cycle, unplug, etc., called Vizio's tech support and no luck. There only advice was to call a 3rd party repair service as the TV is out warranty.A little web searching revealed this a repeated problem with this Vizio TV and WatchOn.
