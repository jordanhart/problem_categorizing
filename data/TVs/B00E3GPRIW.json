Nice contrast and deep blacks.Set up is super easy. Built in apps are easy to access. Wifi Setup is also a breeze.The QWERTY keyboard on the back of the remote is a really sweet feature! I appreciate that.Sound is pretty good once you turn off JVC's \"3D Cinema Sound\" or whatever they call it. The Cinema Sound made background sound and music really loud and foreground dialog really quiet. It's better turned off. Then you can lift the bass a little.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:The power, LAN line, and two HDMI ports are in the very back of the screen and are extremely hard to reach. There is only one (1) HDMI port on the side of the screen that is easy to access (my old Visio had four HDMI ports on the side of the screen).I'm using the one (1) side HDMI port for my Chromecast dongle and there is also a USB port on the side too. So that works well. But the other two (2) HDMI ports are way in back, difficult to reach, and also impossible to see because all the ports in back are inverted (upside down). This port set up is probably ideal for a wall mount, but I'm mounting this to an articulating wall mount in the corner.Also, I wish the four mounting bolts had been included. The mounting pattern on this TV is 400mm x 400mm, so I needed to buy an adapter for my wall mount which maxes out at 200mm x 200mm. That's fine, but JVC doesn't give you the four (4) bolts needed to mount this TV. The JVC manual says that you need M8 bolts. Fine, I can find M8 1.25mm bolts, but how deep should they be? JVC doesn't say, and JVC doesn't sell the bolts. In fact, I can't find them anywhere online, so I will have to go to the hardware store, buy a bunch of bolts of varying depths and try to figure out which ones will work best. For an extra 40 cents, JVC could have included the mounting bolts in the box.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice screen, but not a true smart tv", "Author": "liberty7andy", "ReviewID": "R1KGMHJS91SHN8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I liked the screen quality for the price.  After my initial set up I noticed this TV does not have a Web browser. You only can use JVC pre-installed apps like Netflix and pondora.  And I can not manually add apps. I can not surf the Web sites - this is not true smart TV to me.  Hope JVC develops Web browser app soon.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,302.14", "Features": "50\" ELED 1080P 120Hz HDTV", "Name": "JVC SP50MC 50\" Full HD 1080p LED TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31HJJ5hWd2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E3GPRIW"}}
