The set worked great.  Out of the box the TV comes with a remote, batteries, a manual.  Plain and simple.  The TV displays a full 1080p signal with bright colors.  The TV's Stand attaches easily with just a few screws.  The set is also unbelievably light, given it's size.  In the beginning I bought a high end LG 50\" plasma TV w/ Integrated Bells and Whistles, but the set failed after having it for nearly a year.  That was very frustrating.  This time around I bought a TV for a budget price.  We like it so much that we bought a second set, the exact same model for the living room, and mounted it to the wall.Summary:Pros:  Great Value, Light, Easy to Install, Great Budget Option for those wanting a flat screenCons:  Non-brand name (if that matters to you), Speakers could get a bit louder", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Insignia 39 inch A Real Lemon", "Author": "TheBrooklynMet \"J Victory A\"", "ReviewID": "R3K00R9V3UWW61", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worse experience I have ever had with a TV and Best Buy. Bought this TV on Black Friday for Christmas. Plugged it up Christmas day worked great until April. Screen started rotating though various colors. Would not do anything else. Took it back to Best Buy. They sent it off and when we got it back they said they did a factory restore on it. Worked for about 6 more weeks with no issues then the same thing happened again. Took it back to Best Buy and they would not switch it out for another one (since we did not get their warranty). So we have shipped it off again. Called Insignia and they were no help and pretty much said that was all they could do was keep fixing it. That is great but what happens when the manufacture warranty runs out??? If you want a good tv and a company that will stand behind there product DO NOT BUY THIS TV.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad brand of TV", "Author": "Chris Cap", "ReviewID": "R306DAH4Y2I76L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Brand new tv. I have to push the power button between 3-15 times before it powers up. I will push power, it will blink once, and do nothing. I repeat this until it blinks a few times and then turns on. Best buy basically said sorry that stinks. AFTER buying insignia, i found ALOT of problems.
