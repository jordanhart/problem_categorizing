The screen image is fine but you need a mount that tilts. The DVD player works fine, just read the text on the side as to which way the DVD faces! The only problem we have so far is we can't turn the volume up and you have to be 3 feet away to hear a movie! I have emailed Naxa's support to see if this is typical or a problem under warranty. They only have a 90 day labor warranty so if you buy it and there's a problem, act fast! We just installed it in May having ordered it in January so now we are in trouble.UPDATE: Now the TV won't turn on at all, either on AC or battery. RV dealership tried everything. We are waiting for an RMA # so we can ship it back prepaid to Naxa along with a money order for $35; I guess we will also have to pay to have it repaired. I have written a letter to Naxa support explaining the situation and hope they will send us a replacement at no further charge. If not, I will never recommend Naxa.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Naxa is a great 12 volt system for RV", "Author": "Kyle Bullock", "ReviewID": "R11LC9JGY4WW5V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It works great, for less than $200. I have it mounted in my Truck Camper on a swing arm. All functions work properly and the sound is good for such a small unit.  If your worried about malfunctioning, then buy the warranty as it is very cheap to purchase. If it is not loud enough, there is a head phone jack so you can connect it to an amplifier system.I am very pleased with it and I keep my Camper warm so moisture and cold do not damage it. If your not going to do that then you should unplug the unit.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Won't turn on", "Author": "T.
