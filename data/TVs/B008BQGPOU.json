The company is specified toward electronic products like TV and monitors then bloated companies like Samsung and Sony. I had already owned a Sceptre monitor of great quality that displayed even high end PC gaming extremely well. This 50 inch Sceptre TV is an amazing product at an amazing price. A full 1080p at 60hz TV. I use the TV for PC and console gaming. Please note that the human eye struggles to see the difference between 60hz and 120hz also that smart tv is pointless if you have a modern blu ray player, pc or gaming console. TV has 3 hdmi which is plenty, USB, to audio types one for PC, VGA for PC, composite, component and lastly cable. I don't have tv however so I can't give any feedback on that. This TV works wonder full for using the VGA for PC display. I tried HDMI for my PC, but in my personal opinion VGA outputs better picture quality and HDMI failed to fit the screen correctly. I see no loss in quality from games like Batman Arkham City with Extreme settings on PC compared to the asus vs239h-p monitor. I have a 5760x1080 eyefinity display with three of those monitors and I personally find this Sceptre 50 inch TV to be a more immersive experience. Not to mention 5760x1080 puts more strain on my gpu and ultimately I just don't like the stretched out side viewing of the side monitors. Maybe it makes sense for FPS titiles, but it makes no sense for 3rd person perspective. Their should be no image stretching in my opinion. Lastly, this tv is set at power saving, and vivid isn't that good either. Jack the contrast, color and sharpenss up into the 70-90's for best image quality. Extremely satisfied with this TV.I forgot to say the speakers are horrible, but I will not judge a flat-screen tv on it's sound. Both flat screen tv's and monitor's are not meant to have good sound. I have 17 year old speaker system that works wonderfully. So I'm assuming anyone who's buying a tv has a speaker set up ready for use.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tv stand broke", "Author": "hbrown", "ReviewID": "R17UKXHWWIWXNM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Wife came home and found our tv on the floor and the stand was still on the piece of furniture.

The speakers are a tad anemic but there is a built in equalizer which helps with this shortcoming. The volume is more than adequate. The picture using HDTV over the air is excellent. SDTV is ok but up close become obviously pixelated. I connected a DVD player with component input but the picture can get VERY black in dark scenes and adjustment is necessary.

Don't let the no name-brand turn you off. This is a great TV for the price ($399). The remote control has many useful features that saves time sifting through the on screen menu while watching TV. I love the \"Aspect\" button to make partial screen broadcasts into full screen (Cinema) on the TV with a one push of the button. Also, the \"Sleep\" button is very useful. The sleep feature was not even listed in the specs. The QAM tuner allows watching all unscrambled digital and analog channels without a Set-top box. Picture is sharp and the internal speakers are clear, nice and loud. I don't understand why there are so many unfavorable comments about the sound. My most favorite feature is the \"Favorite\" channels buttons on the remote (No pun intended), which also was not listed in the specs. The four favorite selection buttons on the remote makes it a breeze to select and access your favorite channels.I bought a 46\" Samsung smart TV two weeks ago for $200 more than I paid for this TV. Samsung customer service in India were terrible. I am so glad I returned Samsung and bought this TV. I discovered that I don't need/want the Smart feature for internet access on a TV.  It was so slow and froze so much, it was crazy. A computer is much better access to internet. This TV has a MHL connection for a Roku stick if you want internet access. The old adage that a higher priced item is not necessarily better; holds true with this TV. The package even includes a screw driver and a soft cloth to clean the screen. Not that I needed a screw driver, but it's a sign how detailed oriented Sceptre company is.Cons.:\uf0d8 The USB connection cannot play a movie (motion picture).

That really is the only downside against this tv, which I don't even hold against it since it has an audio out and I have a boss sound system.The picture quality is amazing. 50,000:1 DCR ain't bad. It gives deep blacks and true whites. The picture presets look like they can be changed, but when you try to, it just saves that setting in the one user slot you're allowed, so I usually keep it on power saver unless I roar up my XBOX. There are a couple of energy star features on the extras menu as well, but only turn on \"no signal power off\" unless you have cable hooked up (just a side note).Although the sound isn't great, there are pretty good equalizers that pump a little more sound and make it less awful. There was also a note about the remote having terrible range. Their batteries might have been dead because it works all the way across the room.

So I can't compare it to the name brand HD sets as to picture quality. But I have been completely satisfied with all the Sceptres I've owned.I bought this 50\" set because of the reasonable price and 2 main features--namely that it offers RCA stereo audio outputs and 3 HDMI ports.It amazes me that most brands don't realize that many customers still use analog audio theater systems and have no desire to purchase a digital converter box. RCA audio outs is a simple feature to add to a TV but in my experience only Sceptre and the Vizio \"a-I\" series offer it. (I'm sure there are others--I just didn't see them) So this set saved me $25 right off the bat (no need for digital converter and cord).I currently only use 2 of the 3 HD ports but it's nice to have the 3rd if I need it--many sets cost hundreds more and have only 2 ports. It also has both component and composite inputs for 2 more devices. C'mon now, how many sets offer all these inputs and outputs?I will echo what one reviewer said about the threading of the screws--my base is being held by 4 of the 5 because one screw was impossible to turn. And it took muscle to thread 3 of the other 4. Sceptre, you can do better than this.Also, while the glossy black bevel is quite beautiful, be aware that it will reflect light like glass. It can be a distraction.I believe most picture settings on TV's are on \"power saving\" out of the box--all you have to do is switch to \"user\" and you can configure it the way you want. There are also several preset picture modes that are all better than power saving. I use \"power saving\" for sports talk or politics to be \"green\" and save a little money, and \"user\" for games and movies and sci-fi docs.That's about it. I haven't had an ounce of trouble (aside from screw mis-threading) with any of the Sceptres I've owned. And just to fill you in (since this website doesn't), the dynamic contrast on this set is 50,000. Got it from the user manual. It can't touch LG, Samsung or Vizio, but look at it this way, I saw a 2007 article talking about the norm for native contrast (800:1) and dynamic (10,000:1). So this model Sceptre blows away the picture quality of many TV's of just 6 yrs ago.Bottom line--you won't find a TV with all these features for the price.
