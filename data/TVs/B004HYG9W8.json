We bought another 40\" flat screen TV a couple of weeks ago and had to return it because of the very poor sound quality.

First the screen is so thin, and the picture goes to the edge of the cabinet.  The picture is a huge improvement, so clear you would swear you could touch what you are viewing.  I wasn't sold on the whole LED picture thing but wow what a great picture.  One of the things that just drove me \"Mad\" about the Samsung was the long wait time for the screen to turn on.  The Samsung was so bad that my son broke the button on the TV, not knowing if he turned the TV on or not.  With the Sony it turns on in a flash, NO WAITING.  For my family this was a great investment.  I have small kids and they are always leaving the TV on.  This TV senses if anyone is in the room and shuts itself off, very cool.  I also like how the TV will sense the lighting in the room and automatically adjust the picture to suite the lighting conditions.I also have a Sony BlueRay theater SystemSony BDV-E780W Blu-Ray Disc Player Home Entertainment System (Black).  I read many bad reviews about the sound not being good on the TV itself, but I found the quality to be ok.  When I want to get the full \"Movie\" experience I use my BlueRay System.  No sound issues there.  Because systems are both Sony they sync together and work together.  I really like that.One of the neat things about this TV that I just discovered is you can download a free Iphone App and control the TV right from your phone.  If your house is like mine, you are always searching for the romote.  I usually have my phone handy so I can adjust the volume, or turn the channel without wasting time looking for the lost remote.  If you want to take advantage of Iphone App you will need to purchase the Sony UWA-BR100Sony USB Wi-Fi Adapter.  The adapter is overpriced but it works well, and I look at it like this.  Yes it is overpriced (79.99) for what it is, but it allows me to access the on-line content from Netflix and Youtube etc..........  For me having my phone control both the TV and the BlueRay player was what I was looking for, and you need the UWA-BR100 to do that.If you are looking for a great picture this is the one for you.  If you want the \"Movie\" experience, pick up the BlueRay theater System.  If you do you will feel like you are part of the action.  Now every night is movie night.

We have a DVD player, a VCR tape deck and a  Roku  working on ours.  I suspect this TV could do the streaming without  the Roku, but I haven't pursued it. It can also serve as an excellent PC Monitor.  I found the sound system a bit lacking, so I stole my Harman/Kardon speaker system  from my iMac  and solved the problem.

This will make my third Bravia, but my first LED.  The other two(55\" & 47\") are an LCD.  I did have the requirement of a motion processor (120HZ) in all TVs. It is a must for me. I like my action movies, gaming & sports.  This is my first week with the 40\" LED.  Picture quality? I am not sure yet.  Right now my LCD TVs produce a nicer picture.  Factory settings on the new LED seem to make the picture dark. Yes, I am playing with settings all the time. I have HD cable service and usually a good test station to see the quality of picture your television can produce is by watching National Geo or a news station channel. Those two stations always produce a good picture. Not this time for some reason. Right now, I am kind of bummed out that my LCD TVs are producing a nicer picture then this LED. Maybe, I just have not found that sweet spot on the settings yet.Speakers/Audio - My LCD TVs unfortunately have better sound then this slim line LED.  The slimmer they make these TVs the quality of sound decreases.  Speaker technology can not keep up in making a speaker that small capable of producing a nice sound.  Will not happen for a while. So, invest in a nice home sound system.  I am using the Bose 3-2-1 sound system, not a high end system ($800.00) but a nice sounding system with my 55\" Bravia. The Bravia LCD produces an awesome picture when playing a DVD or Blue Ray DVD movie. With the Bose sound system fired up too(and Bose is known for the quality of sound that their systems can produce)the tanks clunking through Private Ryan and Band of Brothers feel like there coming through the living room wall. It is AWESOME. Got to love it. I like my Bravia LCDs a lot. I believe in the Sony Bravia TVs and I guess I will just have to play with the new LED for a while longer before I come to a final conclusion on the LED.Well, after a week or so of playing with the settings and getting use to the LED compared to the LCD.  I would have to say that the Sony Bravia LED does produce an outstanding high clarity picture.  It is so clear that it is almost weird. You know how the soap opera shows look like they are being filmed on a set/stage.  Well, the clarity to this television makes the night time shows look like that too.  Nice television, nice clarity, speaker system bites, but they all do right now. Unless, your plugged into an external sound system.

Brought it into the house, unpacked and set it up to make sure it works. Picture quality is good but not great. Picture on Samsung is superior to the Sony. There is an irregular string of light that appears at times across the top edge of the screen. Very annoying. A printed setup guide is funished but the user manuual is built in to the TV and it is a genuine pain in the posterior to find an item.  For example, I decided to redo the initial setup in order to try to improve the picture. It would have been easier to hit the lottery. The Sony lacks many of the features of the Samsung. One example is that with Samsung I can plug a flash drive into the back of the TV and watch mkv and other type movies by switching the input to USB. The Sony does have USB jacks but when I plug in the flash drive the TV does not recognize it nor does it have a USB input displayed.In summary, this is my 4th and last Sony purchase.

Unfortunately, I didn't buy extended waranttee for this TV, so we decided to buy Sony.  I believe we have made the right choice. Since the technology is relatively new, I was skeptikal about what its preformance might be, so I bought extended warantee for this TV.  We are not very impressed with the picture quality compared to what we have seen in previous models of Sony Bravia TV.  I can understand that the video engine is a newer one that tries to optimize the picture quality pixel by pixel.  Sometimes the pictures look stunning, and sometimes they look great and sometimes they look a little washed away.  I am not seeing a good solid richness in the color all the time.  May be the automatic software feature will upgrade the X-reality engine as it matures up.The internet feature of the TV is not well tested, but I wired up the TV and took a glimpse of it.  I beleive it's a good feature; there are lots of built in icons like U-tube, pandora, netflix, eitc.  I am not interested in internet as I have AT&T; U-verse TV, and High Speed Internet. But, it's a great feature for those who don't have cable for the TV.I noticed that the presense sensor doesn't work the way it's supposed to.  The default timer is 30 minutes.  It doesn't matter if you are sitting or moving in that time, as soon as 30 minutes passes, a message pops up in the TV that it's going to turn off, unless you press a button from the TV's remote.  If you miss to press the button, then TV goes off, but it comes back right away.I don't understand why Sony decided to set the picture quality to standard as a default in the TV.  The pictures look very dull in standard mode. As soon as I programmed the TV for vivid picture, the quality and color of the pictures became very nice.  I wish Sony had put vivid as the default mode. I noticed a similar problem with the sound setting.  The sourround, 3D, all the good features were turned off.  I beleive this TV's out of box performance was not impressive, to say the least.  This is why we gave it a 4* rating.6/10/11 : The presense sensor was so annoying that I turned this feature off.  I have decided to keep this TV as we have gotten used to the vivid color mode.  I am hoping that Sony would improve this product and comeup with a new software load.  I purchased a Sony BDP S570 player which can easily connect to my home wireless router.  In that way I can watch almost everything that I could have watched using the internet on Sony TV.  I am still trying to figure out how to connect this TV to BDP for internet.

Because of this the screws were loose in the box and the way the box is made the screws must have fallen out of the bottom of the box in transit.

Our model number is Bravia KDL46EX621 (not 620), but even though there are a few minor differences listed on Sony's web site (PiP functionality), I truly think the TV out of the box is the same as the 620 (since the the PiP works just as on the 620). My guess is that the 621 was branded specifically for the likes of Costco and Walmart.So, great functionality, neat is that the TV can control the PS3 over HDMI, that there is a Sony iOS (and Android) remote app that works well, etc. Very handy if you want to type in longer text strings, instead of using the arrow pointers on the (standard) remote.As for picture quality, truly have nothing to complain about. Like the matte screen (compared to the very glossy Samsungs). Will spend some time on going through a \"professional\" image adjust after the holidays, but so far, so good.Sony is sort of \"bland\" in not more promoting all the neat features this TV possess, but maybe it is so you actually get pleasantly surprised when you realize you got more than expected....:-)Have it Ethernet hardwired, and about to connect it to our (PS3) media server in the basement. Do not expect any issues with DNLA.As for rear panel connections, I sort of prefer when the cables drop down vertically, but Sony has most connectors horizontally, mean that you might have to be a bit careful if you expect traffic (kids or animals) behind the TV.

All I can say is for the price, based on a original over $1000.00 manufacture suggested retail, I knew I was way ahead.It isn't a perfect TV, but I don't think you will find one. This however is the one of the best panels out there.I like a Plasma look, but this has just as good or better black levels and color as any I have seen. It is a full 1080 capable TV. I haven't noticed any jitter or lag in the picture at all and that is on a standard setting.The only time I notice any edge backlight lines is when there is no input. (Not a problem)The audio has to be tuned to your initial input device, i.e. cable box or DTV or Dish box. The TV allows you to adjust it to match your likes. In other words, put junk in, get junk out.The picture quality is good regardless of what is being used, Standard Definition, HD or internet content (Yes it is a Smart TV).I updated immediately when I connected it online, to a June 2013 firmware, it can be updated with a USB thumb drive, if not internet connected. It is a 2011 model and one of the first or the first edge lite LED TV's.It doesn't include the wireless dongle (optional). I knew this from the beginning, but intended on a direct wire to my router, which is always going to be faster and better than wireless. It works flawlessly this way and have yet to see any buffering on Netflix, Crackle, etc. Sony isn't Ruko and with most Smart TV's will have limited content. The primary ones are available except Vudo, since it competes against the Sony Entertainment Network. A shortfall on all Sony Smart TV's, they need to allow competition.If you want the wireless dongle look at the 640 model it does come with it and has the XR240 motion, still is a true 120HZ, but be prepared to pay a couple hundred more at most places.The size was chosen because of the location it is being used.What can you do, with the DLNA function, use a Sony Media app for your Android and Apple phone, use as a extra remote. I haven't had any luck with the Qwerty keyboard function yet on the side view option. Stream your music, pictures and and videos from a PS3 using DLNA, or other DLNA devices and it can be done even if you are using a direct connect cable, from your wireless router to the RJ-45 connector on the TV itself. If you want to go for the optional camera, you can use the Skype video services.It has a multitude of connections, HDMI, composite and component, VGA, USB, RJ-45,and Digital Audio out. I haven't tried it yet, but the headphone output jack can with a simple miniature headphone cable to RCA jacks be used on that older high watt Kenwood amp or whatever your using :)It has so many functions, most may never know about or use themThe TV does offer a limited Smart Apps (catalog).Overall it is a decent performer, with tons of options. It is a Sony.I have my own problems with Samjunk. I say this because two TV's failed, in less than 5 months. The support is a joke, the first TV came back improperly repaired, I spent over a month getting the TV's properly repaired. The support service and repair center has to be worst customer experience ever. If Samsung works OK, if it fails good luck.

I had done a lot of research, as I always do with more expensive items, and this Sony model seemed to be the best for what I wanted (Wifi enabled). The set was super easy to set up and I was thrilled - until about six months later, when the set just stopped working. The \"Sony\" would light up when you turned the set on, but then nothing. I tried all the intuitive trouble-shooting: unplug everything, connect it back up, turn it on again - still nothing. See, the thing is - the MANUAL IS ON THE TV. If the TV won't come on, the manual doesn't do you a lot of good. Good thinking, Sony! Then I went through the grueling process of trying to find out how to contact Sony, since it was still under warranty. That took about three hours searching online - first trying to find the link to customer service, and then my \"chat\" with their trouble-shooter took over two hours. He basically told me to do what I had already done. He ended up telling me I needed to take it to a local Sony dealer so they could look at it. He said if they were unable to fix it, Sony would replace the unit, but I would have to mail it back to them. I finally found a dealer in Denver; it took me half an hour to get through on their phone system, only to go through exactly the same \"trouble shooting\" I had gone through online. So...we took another half hour for him to find out what Sony would do and to take down my information. He would send me another set, but it would be a refurbished one (I figured since I had had the set for six months, it was used, so this was probably fair, and if it was refurbished, maybe they would have found and fixed the original problem) and would have a full year warranty. I would need to send the non-functioning set back in the same packaging. They took my credit card information to have in case I didn't send the old set back.

I generally tend to prefer larger screens, but ended up selecting this TV. I was initially reluctant to pick this up since the only thing it seemed to offer was the thin bezel and frame and DLNA support. I already had a sony blu ray player that could do Netflix and Amazon and all other online video playback. However, I still went for this one since it was supposed to more power efficient and being smaller and lighter, I felt the wall mounting would be easier.The small size and weight (~30 pounds) definitely helped with transportation (as opposed to 60+ pounds for the 55\" LCD). Assembly was a breeze. I still haven't connected it to a blu ray source or cable TV but I've already been blown away by the network support. Yes, this TV is designed to support networking features from the get go: the remote has dedicated buttons for Netflix (colored RED!) and for Sony's own Qriocity network. I didn't pay the additional $80 for the wifi support, but instead hooked this up to my wired ethernet. I was up and running in MINUTES! Registered the TV to my existing sony bravia account and my Amazon videos came alive in less than 30 seconds. Streaming quality and sound were very good. Sound isn't supposed to be LED backlit TVs' strong suite, but this TV did absolutely fine (placed in my bedroom).What blew me away though was the DLNA video playback: I've tried this with a PS3 and a few other devices in the past and have come up typically disappointed. In the past, VOB files wouldn't play, or would not transition properly. Not this champ. With my Ubuntu server running media tomb, I went in and changed the \"Playback mode\" to \"all files\" and this TV kept playing all the files in order and without any delays, lags or other glitches! I'll update more as I play with this tv.I'm keeping my eyes peeled for dimness / gradient issues, any pseudo banding artifacts, false contouring or judder issues. I have almost completely turned the Motionflow setting off since I don't like the \"soap opera\" feel to my movies. I love the in-depth video controls this baby offers (though for most purposes, the simple menus and defaults work just fine). I changed mine from Vivid to Custom since Vivid was eye teasingly bright and soap-opera style. Though, i guess some folks like that.

Absolutely perfect if your main uses include enjoying Playstation 3 games and Blu-ray movies (I do not use this set for anything else, so I cannot comment on its performance concerning other realms of entertainment). I have but one important, easily rectifiable issue to note:At first I was unhappy with the dismal contrast (the letter-box bars were noticeably bright on every movie). I did not have this problem with my Sony Bravia 46\" LCD, so I assumed that it was a unique issue with Edge-LED technology. I am, however, happy to report that I have solved this issue by making sure that the display received an RGB signal with FULL dynamic range (0-255) via HDMI. Again, my only source is a Playstation 3, which I use to play PS3 games and Blu-ray movies only (this setting should apply to both). From my experience, many other Sony Blu-ray players offer the option to output RGB with FULL range as well. An added bonus is Deep Color (12-bit), which this TV accepts (though I'm not sure it can do much without a 12-bit source... but it certainly doesn't hurt, provided you have ample HDMI bandwidth).In conclusion, I cannot stress enough the importance of outputting RGB with FULL range rather than the normally default Y-Pr/Cr-Pb/Cb; the difference is truly night and day, especially for movie sources that are not natively 16:9 and require letter-boxing. I am a poor college kid with very discerning and selective eyes, usually a frustrating combination in the expensive world of consumer electronics; for me to award a perfect score to an HDTV in this price range is a rarity to say the least, but do have faith.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall A good buy", "Author": "Eva & Henry", "ReviewID": "RAT0DI82PBIDC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this through Amazon Mom.

The ARC (audio return channel) was an added bonus, since that lets me run Netflix as an internet-TV application and send audio over HDMI downstream to the reciever (via ARC).I am very happy with the product, but I still wish the interface was better designed.  It is similar to the crossbar menu system Sony uses in the PSP and PS3 game systems.  The organization of menu items is somewhat poorly conceived.  Thankfully, the remote that shipped with the TV has a button that loads Netflix within seconds.  The menu system is quick and responsive though.  One more complaint:  the application updates are an inconvenience, much like the process of updating a Playstation 3 game system.  All of a sudden, TV applications won't run because they need to update... but the TV doesn't TELL you it is time to update.  I think this can be prevented by allowing it to update automatically, but like most consumers, I like to be in control of the thing I purchased.  Sony, please stop dictating your own terms to your customers...I knew what I was getting into when I made this purchase, and do not regret it.  The picture quality is excellent, and the various applications that run on the TV are quite nice and eliminate the need to attach other devices to the TV for Netflix, YouTube, etc.Overall, this is clearly a quality product with many technical features that will not be standard on other brands for another hardware generation.

I bought it to use with my PC instead of having to buy a monitor as it would have been a lot more expensive. I also watch movies and have an HD cable box hooked up by HDMI which looks great.So the main reason why I bought this monitor is because I wanted to use it as a monitor. During Black Friday I went and bought a 42\" Vizio LED 3D TV from Wal-mart for like $600, the picture on the Vizio looked great by when trying to use it as a PC monitor it just failed. The text was really blurry and u could actually see the horizontal lines thru the Vizio TV because you are sitting so close. So I decided to do some research and I found out that this TV (40EX621 or 40EX620) will do 4:4:4 Chroma and I don't believe that it down samples it (Without 4:4:4 chroma the TV will cause edges to blurry and color uniformity will be slightly off while using it as a PC monitor).While using the TV as a PC monitor, text is as crisp as a regular PC monitor and it looks amazing. You have to mess with the settings to get the picture right to use it as a monitor, but there is instructions on how to do it in the manual. I am using a DVI to HDMI to connect the TV to my PC.This TV games pretty well, I did not notice any input lag when I had it it \"Game Mode.\"There are also an abundant amount of settings to choose from and you can customize pretty much about anything.Picture quality while watching blu rays is pretty good and SD picture looks good also. Sound is good, better than a lot of other TVs I heard.So ya that's pretty much it. If your looking for a great 40\" LCD-LED to use as a PC monitor then this TV is amazing for that (Settings have to be correct). I had tested some LED TVs as PC monitors and this one beats all of them. This LED is also great for watching football, movies, TV shows, etc. With all the settings they have you can change it to your liking.

My first large screen LCD, the TV seemed like a steal at $878 plus tax (about $950). There were only 2 left at the store in north Austin so I snatched it up. Not sure what difference there is, if any, from the 40EX620...but I have researched prices on the 21 and they are north of $1k online. I think it is pretty much the same set.Pros: Sleek design, nice black glossy finish, very thin, ample inputs, excellent user interface. I have read some reviews complaining about the remote control, but if you use a second remote for your cable or other TV provider, I don't see it as a major flaw. I did not get a chance to try the internet apps because I could not get past the picture quality. The TV comes with a nice little stand that pivots and is easy to attach. Speaker quality was better than average for a flat-panel TV.Cons: Picture quality. Maybe this is inherent in all LCDs, but I just couldn't get past it. I have a 50\" Pioneer 5020fd plasma for my living room and the picture quality on it is just fantastic. I purchased the Sony LCD for my bedroom thinking that a slightly inferior image quality and shallower blacks would not bother me. I was wrong.The picture quality is just always a bit fuzzy. It looked OK in high-def when objects are stationary, but still a bit fuzzy on the edges. When things are in motion, the image quality really falls apart. And, if the show you are watching is not in HD, it just plain sucks.I really wanted to like this TV, as I like the aesthetic design of it, and espcially the user interface, but I just can't compromise on picture quality. To me, that is the most important thing. If the picture quality is not your priority, then I think you might really like this set.I bought a Panasonic TC-P42ST30, a 42\" plamsa that is getting great reviews, for $949...but I have not set it up yet.
