I used my service plan and got a full refund since they didn't even want to touch the thing. The only problem i've found that that the prices in 6 months actually increased and suddenly I found that 42\" 1080p LCDs were less common.I first went with the Samsung LN-S4695D. I had some major issues with that so  returned it for this. I originally skipped this Sony for the Samsung because it was cheaper.When I purchased this I knew of the cloud issue and had them deliver it and crossed my fingers. Turned it on and after awhile I noticed clouds. The problem in all honesty does not bother me AT ALL EVER. I think in the 4-5 months i've owned this i've noticed it once or twice. Please note that I almost NEVER watch TV in the dark. If you do, maybe it's more of a problem. Sony's claim that it's \"normal\" is such a joke. How could you ship out thousands of these LCDs with this issue and knowing it's there? I've knocked off a star due to this. For the price you pay on this thing (it was more expensive when I bought it months ago) you'd expect it to be perfect. My first Sony was. It's not true that there is no PERFECT TV out there. There is.Anyway, I immediately calibrated this using AVIA and DVE and the picture quality is even better than any previous TV i've owned by far. This thing has so many features in the menu system that you could spend hours just configuring it to get it right. I disliked the menu system on the Samsung and this one is so much better. It's really easy to navigate and not slow.This also has so many different types of connections. Three HDMI ports. Most people think two is enough, but I don't agree. I currently use all three. Switching inputs on previous Sony televisions was a pain. Now it's a little bit easier. To press a button to display 'external inputs' and switch to the one you want. You can even label the inputs. I have mine set to PC, Wii, PS3, Cable and DVD PLAYER.Games show no ghosting at all that i've noticed. A couple times i've noticed very slight motion smearing on really low quality cable TV. It's extremely rare and i'm going to blame my cable provider because it never happens on DVDs or anything else.I don't use the TV speakers but I do when I connect my HD antenna up. That's about once every 2 weeks for NBA games in HD. Some would complain it sounds bad but they've probably never heard sound from other LCDs. My mother's plasma display has such bad sound that it sounds like it's coming from a $2 speaker. Honest. It's impossible to listen to it it's so bad. The sound from the speakers isn't good, but acceptable. My guess is that a large percentage of the people that buy a TV this expensive have a home theater system. I currently use a Yamaha Sound Projector since i'm in an apartment.The design is much better than my Samsung I previously tried out. The only problem is that it will not tilt/rotate like the Samsung did. Not a big deal for me but it would have been nice. The design on the back is not good. It's hard to access all the HDMI and cable inputs. I'd imagine it's like this due to some people wanting to mount this on a wall? It's nothing  that bad.HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray movies are pretty amazing on this thing. Same goes for Playstation 3 games. DVD movies even look good but it depends on the DVD quality. Old movies don't really look good. I'm mainly talking about DVDs that came out when the players cost a fortune. I've compared the picture quality between an upconverted movie and one that's not and I definitely  notice a huge difference.I will admit though that my Oppo DVD player hates this LCD. It will display dark scenes but they will contain greenish tint/macroblocks etc. I thought it was the LCD but i've tried 5 others and this does not occur. I've tried many ways to fix this with not much luck. I currently use the Denon 575 and so far so good.Standard \"Digital\" cable still looks terrible in most cases. I don't have HD cable yet and my cable provider's picture quality is terrible. That's all. It's not the TV's fault. Too bad I can't get Satellite TV out here.I also was pretty impressed with the results I got when I connected my PC to this. Seeing your desktop at 1080i is pretty nice. I don't really use this feature though much. I've played a game that supports widescreen at that high of resolution (Final Fantasy XI) and it looks pretty good!Other than the few negatives above, I can't think of many. I've waited months to post a review. I really wanted to give it some time. So far i've not experienced many problems at all.The cloud issue might make it a risk buying this. Maybe they've fixed the problem already. Even with the cloud issue it's still a good TV. BTW my clouds are nearly impossible to see until I have a completely black screen and my lights are down. I have them on the top left and bottom left. When the actual movie plays they are GONE. Completely unless a scene is completely black, not just a little dark.If I run into anything bad i'll update this review.

It really shines displaying HD. Nature shows on HD Discovery are unbelievable with out-of-the-box color calibration seeming very good to my eye. I can still picture the vivid snake scales and close ups of Mantises (Mantisi?) days after watching them on this set.The only downside is that I notice some macro-blocking if I sit within about 6 feet. Not really a problem though since we usually sit further back. Also, I think this may be an issue with the content encoding rather than the TV itself.I've read in forums that some people are disappointed in the non-HD performance of the TV. However, while it really does shine in HD, I find it totally acceptable when viewing the occasional non-HD content.Definitely worth checking out if you are in the market for a high end TV and plan on watching lots of HD.

Everything about it screams quality -- the incredibly vivid image, the absurd amount of inputs, and the striking physical design.However, if you watch dark films (say, the Godfather, or Underworld: Evolution) in the dark (as in a movie theater), you will quickly be exposed to the set's weakness: the so-called cloudiness defect.  On a totally dark image, you will see lighter-than-black patches, which will mean an uneven blackness level, and thus a distracting \"cloud\" effect when the camera moves through a dark scene.  Don't be surprised if you end up feeling very frustrated at this.I give the set 3/5 stars -- but it would have been 5/5 easily if not for the clouding problem.", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture - but poor quality control", "Author": "H. Doan", "ReviewID": "R2FQLJQIBTU7E8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Sony KDL-46XBR2 is perhaps one of the best LCD televisions in the market today.  Its features, picture quality, and design make it second to none.  Historically, the XBR name has symbolized perfection and top notch quality.  Sadly, even with how great these televisions perform with HD content, it would appear that Sony has been bitten by the quality control bug once again (recalled laptop batteries and digital cameras).It would appear that many LCD panels used in these sets (which are manufactured by Samsung) appear to be defective with a problem technically known as \"Mura\" defect.  It's a common problem in the manufacture of LCDs where the screen shows low contrast patches of non-uniformity.  Most people who have seen this problem describe it as \"cloudy\".In bright scenes, mura defects are undetectable - however, if you watch movies where there are a lot of dark scenes, like Batman Begins or any of the Alien movies, this defect becomes very apparent and bothersome.  It's like you're watching through a smudged screen that can't be cleaned.Based on unofficial polling of people who have purchased both the 40 and 46 inch XBR2s on the AVS forums as well as my own personal experience with three different KDL-46XBR2 sets I have exchanged, this cloudiness problem appears to be quite prevalent.  Based on the poll numbers from AVS (non-scientific and very likely skewed to the defective side) a little under 60% of these sets have been reported as having this problem by people who have purchased this TV.The stinger in this case is that sets built in July and early August do not appear to exhibit this problem.  Sony appears to have cut back on QC starting in late August through October to try and meet expected holiday demand.  Sony has yet to officially acknowledge this problem as customer support repeatedly denies that such an issue exists.It's quite a dilemma for me as I still own a cloudy set even after exchanging this TV back to my retailer three times.  I really want to keep this set as it's still the best LCD panel out there IMHO - even with its flaws.  But for the price I paid for it, I do expect a certain degree of quality which Sony has really fallen short on as of late.", "Date": "December 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "AMAZING TV...But....Clouding Issues are a problem!", "Author": "Bruno", "ReviewID": "RVUBQA4E0V31D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned a 46xbr3 for over a month now. I would 1st like to say that the image of this TV is awesome. The menu options you have to tweak the look of the image is very very detailed. It helps if you run component and HDMI signals and need to have different tweaked settings to optimize look and reduce pixelization. 1080p with your playstation 3, blu ray or hd dvd players. The tv does not run 1080p component, only hdmi and vga, so your xbox 360 will have to run in 1080i (still looks great). The xbox 360 does run 1080p through vga input on this tv but xbox360 makes the screen look washed out.Clouding Issue:There is however a manufacturing defect that is not officially published by sony and no recall is yet in effect. The Sony LCD flatpanels XBR2/XBR3 40\"/46\"/52\" screens have a greater then 50% chance to have a defect nicknamed \"clouding\". I am one of those unlucky buyers. What \"clouding\" basically is, is white puffy looking background lighting, when screen is black. This is not to be confused with non uniform lighting often seen in PC lcd panels; This is much worse and much brighter and heavily blotchy. For most people with this problem (including myself) you can only see this clouding during times when the screen goes black. (credits at the end of the movies, transitions between commercials to tv shows, dark parts scenes in movies and shows.) During these dark scenes they stand out like a sore thumb and make viewing distracting; due to the fact they are very bright and whitish. My experience is the longer the TV stays turned on the brighter these clouds get. When you 1st turn on the Tv they are very faint.  They also have an odd habit of shifting around the panel very slowly over the course of weeks. (as strange as this may sound) I have found the clouding does not discolor or overbrighten the screen when the TV has full colorful images on it. This is why this problem is tolerable and I did not demand my money back, its still not acceptable though. I have read a few users say their clouding is so bad it effects the colors and makes them washed out. Thankfully I have not seen that.Please do not take my word for any of this I encourage you to be a critical thinker and go out on google and seek this \"sony lcd clouding\" issue. I am doing my part for the small community of us who are stuck with this sad problem overshadowing what is otherwise an absolutely great HDTV.In closing this TV is beautiful looking but when you spend this much money you don't want things like this bringing down your morale over the product. If you buy this TV you could be one of the lucky buyers and get an untainted screen and most stores give you a 30 day return policy. I have also heard (not confirmed) that the newest manufactured models have fixed this issue. I gave the product 5 stars despite the flaw, because even with this flaw I love this TV.Best of luck with your HDTV purchases.

Almost bought a Sony sxrd rptv but the \"green blob\" problem, that I actually saw in stores after it reportedly had been fixed, put an end to that pursuit.I bought a KDL-46v2500 (non xbr version of this set) in a local store but was very disapointed with the standard def. picture.  It does not have the wide range of adjustments that the xbr has so the images seemed soft and less detailed.  I returned the set and ordered the xbr from Amazon.  The delivery went very well with \"white glove treatment\" as promised.The xbr hd pq is very similar to the v2500 but the sd picture is far superior, if adjusted properly.  I'm still playing with adjustments after a month.The xbr has a variable audio output with the tv speakers on. The v2500 did not have this nor did other brands that I looked at.  This allows me to have good sound with a simple external subwoofer without firing up my big stereo system.In looking at other brands such as Sharp and Samsung I noticed less detail in people's faces, sometimes called \"clay face\".  Xbr, in particular, showed more subtle detail than the others.I like the appearance of the set since the light colored trim blends with the wall color better than black.  The effect is less dominating.The only disappointments are the viewing angles and black level.  I would rate the angles at 60 to 90 degrees not 178.  The contrast and color drop off at wider angles (not unique to Sony).  I also have an older Sony rptv with dark gray blacks and expected the new sets to be far superior because of the 7000 to 1 contrast ratios.  The xbr is better but I am still aware of gray blacks at times, particulary with the room lights low.  There are enough settings of the backlight, contrast, etc.  to improve this but having to change settings for various light levels is a chore.I was concerned about clouds and have seen little-to-none with my settings.  Occasionally, I think that I see a lighter area in the lower left corner but it seems to depend on the material being viewed.  Most of the time I seem no problem.Overall I am very happy with this set and will keep it for the long term.UPDATE 6-28-07 I would like to add additional comments after a week or two more of using this set.  I have found a backlite setting that works for all room lighting levels and the blacks are now black except under low room light conditions.  They are, at worst, very dark gray and very acceptable.  The viewing angle is very wide but my comment was that the picture does change with angle somewhat.  Useful viewing can be done at very wide angles.  Finally, I should comment on the excellent picture in HD.  When I originally wrote this I assumed that people had read the good reviews, comparing Sony to other brands, that talk about good shadow detail, high resolution, good colors, lack of banding, nonreflective screen, etc.", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "ONE WORD - CLOUDS!", "Author": "J. McNab", "ReviewID": "R3L8NZVBPDMZK4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been through 4 XBR TVs and all of them have had clouding backlight issues - also known as 'mura'.  I swapped my first 40XBR2 out for a 46XBR2.  The 46XBR2 was the worst of the four I'd had.  It came complete with the brightest and most widespread clouding and also one stuck green pixel!The problem is most visible in low lighting conditions and can be readily seen when watching dark scenes in movies or games.  I noticed my first set had clouding when watching Superman Returns.  During the scene when Superman flies into outerspace and is kicked back with his cape flowing out behind him, I noticed clouds with him in outerspace.  It was impossible to overlook this issue.Were it not for the superior picture during other conditions (i.e. a lit room showing content that didn't contain a lot of shadows), I'd have given up immediately on the Sony XBR2's.  However, I have been through the ringer with buying a set only to have to cart it back to Best Buy the next day.Sony is also officially not acknowledging this problem.  The customer service response for some members of the AVS forum has been alarming.  Some have had Sony authorized repair techs come to their house only to be told \"this is normal.\"  When I called Sony, they told me to \"return it to the store\" if I was still within the thirty day period.I strongly suggest anyone considering this TV to search on Google the following words \"Sony XBR clouds.\"  You will find more than a few hits that will lead you to online forums.

More on this issue can be found in the AVS forum (Official Sony 46\" XBR LCD Uneven Backlight/Cloudy Thread).  This problem is apparently affecting all Sony 40\", 46\" and 52\" LCD TV screens.Now comes the worst part, Sony's official stand on this issue is that this is `not' a defect and is not covered by warranty (see above thread for more details).

We sit an average of 8' from the screen when we watch it and it is very comfortable.  It is not too close.I have seen the clouding that some of the critics have mentioned, but I have only noticed it when the television is on, but there is no actual signal to the television.  In short, it does not effect the actual viewing experience.I have also read that some people think that the speakers are terrible, but I disagree.  For television speakers, the television sounds great.  It is not a theater sound, but it sounds great.The picture is great with natural color.  Not as spectacular as the Samsung in contrast and color, but ultimately easier to live with.  The color production seems far more natural and easy on the eye, but not \"eye candy.\"  The Sony seems to have a picture that seems to have a 3 dimensional quality.  When I looked at the Sharp and Samsung, they looked more like pretty wallpaper, but without the dimensional quality.The LG looks like a very good television for the money, and the color production on the Mitsubishi is spectacular.  I have not compared them with the Sony for the sense of depth, but they both seem to be a great television for the money and hundreds if not a thousand off the price of the Sony.Finally, our viewing rooms have lots of window light. The plastic screen on LCD televisions do not have  significant reflection like plasma televions or standard tube televisions with glass screens.  Plasmas are great if you have a theater room.  In many ways, the plasma produces a superior picture, but mostly in a dark room that minimizes reflection on the screen.

They unpacked the LCD and made sure it worked and then they were on their way. I immediately went to my local cable company and upgraded my cable box to HD. It took about a half hour to connect all the cables and to finally start watching HDTV. The standard signals look great from a distance but when I got closer to the screen, you can really see the pixelation of the reception. However, when I tuned to the HD signals, the picture was superb. I really cannot say enough about the picture quality of my set. It's difficult for me to watch standard signals now because the HD is so good. I have a build date of December 2006 on my set. I do notice some slight clouds when I switch through the video inputs with the remote and thats when there is no signal. Once the signal is connected, I have no cloud issues. I've watched the Discovery Channel HD as well as my Star Wars trilogy in HD with nothing but outstanding results. All this with using the component video cables that were included with the set. I've yet to use HDMI cables because they are so expensive but that's another issue. I will upgrade to that in the near future.

So far Sony doesn't seem to have owned up to there being a problem, but as another reviewer said, there seem to be quite a few people out there having this problem.Everything else about the set is great, but make sure you can watch the set in a dark room with the input switched to an input with no signal before you buy it so you can decide if you can live with this problem.If this was a $1500 no name set I might cut it some more slack, but for a top of the line Sony, this is inexcusable.", "Date": "December 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Blu-ray Movies at 1080p on this TV Rock!", "Author": "D. Stephens", "ReviewID": "R3AYDGJREH7TK3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this HDTV 2 weeks ago and I'm very satisfied.  The picture while watching Blu-ray movies from my PS3 is stunning--the first time you see it is a 'WOW' moment.  Daylight viewing blows my old TV away--this LCD HDTV is bright and has NO glare like my old TV even with sunny windows behind me.  The TV looks good just sitting there off, and again the picture is awesome when it's on.More positives...  Build quality is high, plenty of inputs, and even the sound from the TV is good when I'm not using my external receiver.If you don't have a 1080p HD source you are missing out.  I got a PS3, HDMI cable, and changed my NetFlix preferences to have them send me Blu-ray discs.  Note that you can get very cheap HDMI cables out there so shop around--$70+ cables are a waste of money as there is no difference in sound/picture quality.As others have mentioned you have to change the default settings for a picture that suits you and makes standard broadcasts better (take it off 'vivid'; cut sharpness, etc).  If you're coming from a good CRT TV like I was, expect an LCD to look worse with non-digital signals than your old TV.  Old broadcast signals look bad on a hi resolution LCD (especially compared to HD), but changing the TV's many settings can improve them significantly.On the downside...If I sit in a totally dark room with no signal on the TV I can see some uneven blackness across the screen.  This is probably the cloud issue others have mentioned.  I suspect this has been improved over what other people have seen in the past because it's hardly worth complaining about--I can't even see it if the room isn't dark or if I'm not staring at a black screen.  Maybe if you like sitting in dark rooms at night staring at black screens it might be an issue for you.  When I'm actually watching something all I see is great picture.Another negative is with so many inputs it takes too many clicks on the remote to traverse the menu and get to an alternative input.  There should be a single button on the remote that lets you jump between active inputs or something.  I'm still playing with it to see if there is a quicker way to switch inputs.As someone else mentioned the various width settings are a bit confusing.  I don't want to clip the image and I hate modes that distort/widen the image but it's not always clear to me what a mode is doing without cycling through them.  Luckily it's easy to cycle through them with a single button on the remote.It has a good remote but somehow I don't quite like it as much as my previous Sony remotes (I can't quite put my finger on why).  Maybe it feels slightly cheaper or something.Anyway minus a star because the set isn't perfect, but it's dang close.", "Date": "March 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "AMAZING TV!

Here's the deal. The \"cloudy XBR\" is half true. When the room is dark and the set is powering up / showing a pure black screen you will see the \"clouds\" which basically seem like uneven light spill over. However, it's not shown such behavior while watching real content -- at least not that I could notice. As always, look for yourself. Consumer Reports makes the same observations: that the set does demonstrate this behavior, but their engineers could not see it when the set is showing real content.I am using this with a base playstation 3 (cheapest blu-ray player out there) to play the discs.The 1080p content is incredible. It's like looking through a window practically. I have no idea if Sony is going to win the format war, but 1080p is one amazing experience and this screen does the job.Watching DVDs through this rig? Not so good. Now it's a little hard to say if that's because expectations are set so high by the 1080p experience. I mean, you can sit a LOT closer to a 1080p signal without noticing blocking artifaces than you can a DVD output because there's just a lot more information in each frame of 1080p. So picture you set your sofa the right distance (indeed, buy the right sized screen) for 1080p content and then fire up a DVD at the same distance on the same screen. Clearly, there's an issue.The sound is OK. It's not great. Chances are if you are dropping this kind of money on a TV, you can afford some 5.1 system to help that out. That said, for space reasons I'm using with the native speakers and am reasonably happy. It's not got at all the bass response desired, and there's obviously no surround going on -- but it's OK.Just a few other comments. LCDs get dinged for viewing angle. Not this screen. Looks great. LCDs get dinged for slow response on motion. This is more true. Motion content is naturally blurry, so it's a little hard to tell, but it's pretty clear that there is panel blur on this set. You are not going to want to watch sports or fast pan action on this tube. But the picture is lovely even given all that.Finally, if you've got the space, I'd recommend a DLP (or the Sony equivalent) rear projection box. Those have the hands down best viewing properties out there and are a load cheaper for basically the same viewing quality and size. But if you are in love with the truly thin form factor (like I am) then take a look at the KDL-46XBR2.

It looks beautiful in my living and goes most excellent with my new tv stand.This unit only received a 3 star rating from me due to the poor quality control.  I received my unit with audio dead on arrival.We had tried all sorts of hookups, bypassing this and that and yet we can't seem to get audio from the tv.  Chatted with Sony rep online, was a useless experience.Finally I was able to reach a Sony rep over the phone the next day during their regular hours, the rep was really helpful and courteous, walked me through all the troubleshooting, and yet in the end, the Sony rep concluded \"...you basically have a dud...\"So now I know I have a lemon, I then called Amazon.com about the problem, the service reps I had spoken with were very helpful and excellent in customer service, they set up a UPS call tag for the return of the product.  At the time of the problem, Amazon.com was backordered 1-2 months with this product so I was not about to get a replacement anytime soon, so I decided to call a local Sony-authorized service rep to drop by to see if he can fix the problem.  And told the UPS person I no longer needed a pickup.When the Sony authorized tech first arrived, we had audio from the TV, this was preceded by some strong static sounds I heard the night prior while watching my dvds - they were coming from the TV, thought nothing of it, I pressed the mute button on the TV set to make it go away.The coincidence of having audio when he arrived to service the unit was not good, but I still was adamant there was a problem with the audio.  However, he told me there can't be anything wrong with the audio from the TV as diagnostics did not display any problems with the TV. And the technician told me that there has not ever been an audio problem that required servicing since Sony has sold over 12,000 of these units.  But I had to be the first to experience this, right...  And he tried to convince me the static I heard was coming from my DVD/receiver and totally disregarded the fact that the static became louder when I up the volume on the TV and vice-versa and finally the mute button pressed made the static sound go away.  How dense does he take me for.Well, while for the umpteenth time of recapping our experiences with the TV from since day 1, with agitation and inflection in my voice, in the middle of retelling my story the static came back and the technician immediately told me that there is something wrong with the audio board and that he would order a replacement and he came back in two days to replace it.It's now the 5th day since the replacement of the audio board, so far I still hear audio without static or it fading away. So, the reason for the 3 stars rating is due to quality control.  So far I have not experienced any negative experiences with the picture, although clouding as mentioned by other reviewers is very noticeable and severe all over my screen during dark scenes and when the room is not fully lit.Luckily it was the problem was isolated to the audio board only so I was willing to tolerate a replacement of the audio board instead of the hassle of waiting forever for a replacement TV.

Although I like the set's general performance, it has several annoyances with regard to the technological functionality, for want of a better terminology.1. If I muted my old set, closed captioning appeared. When I \"unmuted\", the sound came back and the captioning disappeared; a very simple operation. The Sony set - and I've confirmed this with Sony - can get closed captioning only by use of the menu and it is either \"on\" or \"off\" irrespective of the sound being on or off. Although brief use of closed captioning, when the set is muted for a phone call, may be useful, having it on constantly is very annoying. It can only be turned off by going through the menu. Sony has confirmed that all their TVs use the same system. Even JVC has only one 26 inch model with the older system. This may be a new, but inconvenient trend.2. The set is supposed to automatically choose the `correct\" screen format. I can't really understand all the differences, but some formats seem almost ridiculous. For example, \"Wide Zoom\" and \"Full\" seem identical and \"Full Zoom\" cuts of some of the image. However, as I tried to figure things out, I chose the \"Normal\" setting, an override to an almost square image with wide vertical bars. Assuming that the set selects the best image, I tested what happens if I then shut the set off and turn it back on; it remains at the \"Normal\" setting - or whatever the setting might have been. I realized that the \"Auto Wide\" feature was turned off - -at least as the set was received; turning it on makes no difference - again confirmed by Sony. So, I'm really still confused as to how images are selected and what is the best format; I've arbitrarily chosen \"Full\" and, depending on the program, I get a full screen or horizontal bars. The \"Auto Wide\" seems to serve no purpose.3. An annoying feature is that one requires use of the menu to select DVD or VCR, etc. However, at least in my setup, as I am not using a cable box, but have my cable into my VCR and then to the TV, I can switch to channel 3 with much less fuss and, after use of the VCR, just select any desired channel. However this doesn't work for the DVD and if and when I add a cable box will not work for the VCR. But why bother with multiple steps? One should be able to switch with just the push of a button.4. The two additional nuisances related to the Universal Remote. It is not fully able to replace, for me at least, my DVD and VCR remotes. For the DVD, there is no button to open and close the disk holder. This is trivial (except for my habit) because one has to go up to the set to insert/remove the DVD. However, the VCR deficiency is more annoying because it can not be used to program my VCR for future recording.And finally, there is the additional issue of the factory settings I was rather amazed to see what I thought are less than optimal settings. Some examples: the color is set to \"vivid\" rather than \"normal\" although the manual suggests the latter as optimal for most viewing and to \"cool\" (confirmed by Sony) which increases blue tones; the treble and base are not set at mid-point; the \"Auto Wide\" feature is off; the sound equalization for constant volume is off; etc.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not quite a perfect 10 - but close.", "Author": "Pixel Image", "ReviewID": "R1RXHXCD0AU1WU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this set for a few days and for the most part am quite happy with it.

I mention that you purchase and trial it first, because the feed from the retail outlets are spread through many TV's and is unreliable at best.

I have done extensive research on both models and contacted SONY on numerous occasions to find out what was really the differance. The only differance between this SONY KDL-46XBR3 and the SONY KDL-46XBR2 is that the SONY KDL-46XBR3 has a beautiful piano black bezel (bezel is outer part of the TV) which you can not change. The SONY KDL-46XBR2 has a silver bezel and gives you the option to change the color or the bezels to match your home or style. The color of the bezels are arctic white, pacific blue, velvet black, scarlet red, and sienna brown all which sell for about $299.99 each. Another confusion is that the XBR3 comes with a 18 month warranty while the XBR2 comes only with a 12 month warranty. When I got my SONY KDL-46XBR3 the paperwork stated it had a 12 month warranty. I contacted SONY to find out what was going on and it was then that I was informed that it was incorrect paperwork included. The warranty period is actually 18 months and covers parts, labor, and in-home service only on the SONY KDL-46XBR3. The SONY KDL-46XBR2 has only a 12 month warranty. Why SONY did this on a TV that is almost the exact same I have no idea. Other than that the XBR2 and XBR3 are the exact same. I researched for months before I decided to buy a tv. I looked at the plasmas and almost went with one till a sales rep informed me about the new soon to be released 1080p Tvs. She explained most of the Plasmas today could only display 720p versus the new 1080p format. I then decided to wait a few more months and I researched this SONY and a Samsung 4696 model. After all my research and actually being able to compare the 2 in a store side by side I decided to go with the better picture quality of the SONY. I can truly say I could not be happier. This SONY KDL-46XBR3 is one amazing TV. I purchased the TV from Crutchfield and I have to say I could not be more pleased. I also bought the fairly inexpensive TERK indoor antenna for about $39.99. When I connected it in to the tv, and the Tv finished its auto programming I was able to not only get about 10 HD channels. I received the amazing Discovery HD and ESPNHD through my cable connection, and also a number of digital music channels which I did not expect. I got over 100 digital cable channels and over 80 analog channels. That was a great surprise and if you want to just listen to the music you have the option of turning the picture off and just listen to sound. I like the favorite channel option which lets you save 16 of your favorite channels (including the music ones) and it lets you save both the cable and antenna ones so you don't have to toggle back between the cable and antenna option. The guide button is also another great feature as it gives you show time, time remaining, description of the show (if available by channel)and it lets you know if your show is in 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i, or even 1080p. I connected a Samsung Blu-ray player and WOW! It is an amazing picture just like looking through a window! The ony thing I can complain about is that this tv does not have pip (picture and picture). I feel for the price Sony should have included pip, otherwise it is a great TV. Now many people have asked about the glass around the TV and if it causes a glare with some lighting situations. I think many people think the glass is over the entire TV (like a plasma or tube tv) and it is not. There is only about 1 inch of glass and it is only around the entire edge of the tv and is lined with some type of silver color edging. The glass is so minimal that it does NOT really create a glare, and believe me I have a lot of light(s) in the room my TV is in. I am not sure if SONY used some kind of anti-reflective coating over the glass or what but it really does not create a glare and that really surprised me. Now what does create a minimal glare is the shiny piano black around the screen, but nothing bad at all. When you see the amazing picture quality of this tv you really don't seem to mind those small things.After researching and finding little information on this TV I am posting as much information as I possible can to help others make a more infomed decision on this purchase.(Below is a more in depth review courtesy of Crutchfield.)So much is changing with today's TVs -- shape, size, display technology -- that it's nice you can still count on some things, like Sony's \"XBR\" badge. The BRAVIA XBR line represents Sony's finest LCD TVs ever, with picture quality that's simply stunning. The features and performance of the 46\" KDL-46XBR3 are identical to the KDL-46XBR2 -- the only difference is the XBR3's gloss-black cabinet, which looks extra stylish encased in Sony's clear \"floating glass\" case.The big performance story for the KDL-46XBR3 is \"Full HD 1080\" screen resolution (1920 x 1080 pixels). It provides about twice as many pixels as you get with typical 40\" LCDs. That higher resolution gives images lifelike clarity, detail, and texture -- it's like looking through a window. Colors look strikingly natural, too, thanks to Sony's \"wide color gamut\" backlight, which reproduces a much wider range of colors.You'll want to feed this thoroughbred as much high-quality material as possible, like DVD movies and HDTV programs. But realistically, you'll probably still be watching some regular (non-HD) programs for a while yet. That's when you'll really appreciate the KDL-46XBR3's advanced video processing. The latest version of Sony's DRC (Digital Reality Creation\u00ae) circuitry has twice the processing power of earlier versions. Until now, DRC could only process interlaced video signals, but this version can upconvert both interlaced and progressive video, giving images a smoother, more solid look. Native 1080p signals (like those from Sony's Blu-ray Disc player) are displayed directly, without any processing.The future-ready set of audio/video connections is heavy on HD-compatible connections, including two component video and three digital HDMI for your most advanced video gear. The natural ruggedness of LCD panels helps the KDL-46XBR3 excel as a total entertainment display. Connect your PC and/or video game console and work or play for hours if you like -- LCDs are immune to screen burn-in.Details:\u00bb high-definition TV -- receives and decodes digital standard-definition and HDTV signals from over-the-air broadcasts (antenna required)\u00bb S-PVA (Super Patterned Vertical Alignment) LCD panel for improved off-axis viewing\u00bb widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio\u00bb 1920 x 1080 pixels\u00bb ultra-fast pixel response time (8 milliseconds)\u00bb 1300:1 contrast ratio (7000:1 dynamic)\u00bb 178\u00b0(H) x 178\u00b0(V) viewing angle\u00bb adjustable Wide Color Gamut fluorescent backlight for more accurate colors\u00bb BRAVIA Engine(tm) Pro digital video processing\u00bb adjustable DRC MultiFunction v2.5 (upconverts video signals to 1080p)\u00bb built-in stereo speakers (11 watts x 2)\u00bb multibrand remote control\u00bb picture settings memory for each video input\u00bb 8 A/V inputs, including:* 3 composite video (2 rear, 1 side)* 1 S-video* 2 component video (accepts 1080i/720p/480p/480i signals)* 3 HDMI digital audio/video inputs (2 rear, 1 side) -- accepts signals up to 1080p\u00bb PC input: analog RGB (D-Sub 15-pin)\u00bb 2 RF inputs for antenna/cable signals\u00bb optical digital audio output for Dolby\u00ae Digital\u00bb Energy Star\u00ae compliant\u00bb detachable stand (stand \"footprint\" is 19-5/8\"W x 12-5/8\"D)\u00bb wall-mountable (bracket not included)\u00bb 49-5/8\"W x 28-7/8\"H x 5\"D (31-3/8\"H x 12-5/8\"D on stand)\u00bb weight: 79.4 lbs.

With Sony BRAVIA XBR HDTVs, Full HD 1080 means 1920 x 1080 pixels and 1080p video inputs.1920 x 1080 Panel Resolution: When it comes to high-definition TV the pinnacle of performance is achieved by using 1920x1080 display panels; BRAVIA XBR televisions have them. Full HD 1920x1080 panel resolution with over 2 million pixels (more than twice that of 720p HDTV) is exactly what you need to reproduce the 1080p content that can be delivered by our cutting edge 1080p Blu-ray disc player. And working with BRAVIA Engine PRO everything from standard definition and high definition is upconverted to 1080p for a picture so real it's like you're actually there.Bravia Engine PRO Full Digital Video Processor: Sony improved on the great benefits of the BRAVIA Engine by adding a picture quality enhancement circuit called Digital Reality Creation Multi-function v2.5. DRC-MFv2.5 now has the added ability to process interlace and progressive video signals and because it has twice the processing power of previous DRC-MF circuits, it can do its processing and output them to 1080p. (Native 1080p input signals are not processed through DRC-MFv2.5.) Add to this the crisp details, outstanding contrast, eye popping colors, and dramatically reduced digital artifacts that DRC-MF circuitry is known for. And the best part of all is that DRC-MFv2.5 is user adjustable according to the video source. All of this helps define the reason why people want Sony TVs to begin with-unparalleled picture quality.Live Color Creation System (featuring WCG-CCFL backlighting system): Sony's Live Color Creation System not only pushes resolution to the limit but also brings color reproduction to new heights. Live Color Creation achieves precise and wide color reproduction using a combination of advanced chroma signal processing algorithms along with a specially developed WCG-CCFL (Wide Color Gamut - Cold Cathode Florescent Light). The results have to be seen to be believed. Deep blue levels along with a natural, broad range of greens deliver vibrant colors throughout any scene.7th Generation Sony LCD Panel: The Sony TV uses a 7th generation Sony LCD panel for truly matchless image quality and performance. This panel is produced efficiently from glass to a create large, high quality panel. The PVA high definition display (1,920 x 1080) that is used offers an astounding 178 degree viewing angle, very fast response times and a spectacular contrast ratio.High Contrast Ratio: Sony uses a dynamic backlighting system called ACE (Advanced Contrast Enhancement) on BRAVIA TVs. ACE automatically senses the APL (Average Picture Level) of the video signal and adjusts the intensity of the backlight for improved contrast. VESA test and measurement methods are applied yielding a contrast ratio of 7000:1. This number represents the widest possible ratio between black and white contrast levels. Sony also measures their BRAVIA televisions with a more stringent method that measures the amount of black and white levels that can appear on the screen at the same time. This method yields a more real world measurement of 1300:1.CineMotion: This Technology along with the reverse 3-2 pull-down technology provides smoother picture movement when playing back movies or other video sources on film.Integrated HDTV: This feature allows you to watch digital television programs and enjoy the improved audio/video quality offered by these programs.ATSC Integrated Tuner: This tuner allows the reception of local, off-air digital broadcasts providing the viewing of free, true high-definition network programming without the addition of a set top box or a monthly fee.HDMI: HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) provides an uncompressed, all-digital audio/video interface between the TV and any HDMI-equipped audio/video component, such as a set-top box, DVD player, and A/V receiver. HDMI supports enhanced, or high-definition video, plus multi-channel digital audio.PC Input: The PC input (HD-15-pin) offers easy connection to your PC, allowing you to use your high resolution BRAVIA S-Series Digital TV as a computer monitor.VESA: The TV uses VESA compliant mounting holes to add an optional wall-bracket to hang the television on the wall. The TV is VESA 400 x 200 compatible.Wide Screen Mode: This mode allows you to watch 4:3 normal broadcasts in wide screen mode (16:9 aspect ratio). There are five settings to choose from.Wide Zoom: fills screen with minimum distortionNormal: displays 4:3 picture in original size when original source is 4:3.Full: enlarges the picture horizontally to fill the screen when the original source is 4:3; also use this mode when the original source is 16:9 to display the 16:9 picture in its original sizeZoom: enlarges the original picture without distorting the aspect ratioAuto: screen automatically changes to the screen mode that is best for the current programPicture Mode: The TV features Three Picture Modes to customize your picture viewing.Vivid: This mode enhances the picture contrast and sharpness.Standard: The Standard mode is recommended for your home entrainment use.

Dialog Clarity brings movie dialog into \"focus\" during the playback of any surround-encoded material to make speech much clearer and crisper. TruBass creates incredible deep rich bass allowing a person to perceive significantly deeper, richer low bass tones that are far beyond the physical low frequency capabilities of the speaker itself. And WOW widens the soundstage by processing standard two-channel stereo material as well as multi-channel encoded material for a dramatic improvement in the playback of any stereo audio over a two-speaker system.A/V Sync: Us this option to make adjustments to audio and video synchronization when you have external equipment connected to the Optical Out of the TV.Label Video Inputs: This feature allows you to identify A/V equipment you connected to the TV.

The warranty period is actually 18 months and covers parts, labor, and in-home service.Call SONY for any questions regarding this.Sorry about the long review but I want others to know as much as they can about this TV before buying it. Since this is a huge investment I feel it is appropriate to put as much helpful information as possible.UPDATE 12/13/2006As for this cloudy issue people are talking about I have had NO problem with this issue. My TV looks amazing! The TV comes with a 18 month warranty (12 month on XBR2) and if your not happy with it why not exchange it? I recommend getting an extended warranty for this large of a purchase should you ever have any issues you know you will be taken care of. I highly recommend you check this TV out at a store near you this way you can make a better informed decision and make sure your happy with it before buying one.Please not some of the negative reviews on this TV are from the same person using 5 or 6 different names. You will notice the similarity in the negative reviews.
