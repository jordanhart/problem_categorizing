Great LCD panel:  32\" diagonal, vivid colors, stunning clarity, very good black-level quality, no dead pixels (cheaper brands often have dead pixels)2. Great styling:  looks absolutely beautiful, in the living room or bedroom or your fancy bathroom3. Lots of inputs:  digital inputs, component inputs, PC input.  HDTV tuner is not built-in, though, so you'll need a separate HDTV tuner, which is fine since you likely need to get an HDTV cable or satellite service like VOOM anyway4. Simplicity:  the set-top connector box hides all the wires5. Easy to set up and useBTW, the \"32GD4U\" model (with a D) has a built-in HDTV tuner, but it's also hundreds more.  This present model (without the HDTV tuner) is definitely the better value.", "Date": "November 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "incredible picture, tons of connections", "Author": "Walter J. Davis \"WD\"", "ReviewID": "R2BJ4CY64XYUWJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for about a month. I love the picture. Many adjustment modes, 2 digital inputs on the av box(a separate box that houses all connections) and a very easy remote to learn. The picture is great for hi-def TV and progressive scan DVD. It has a real depth to the picture. I have not noticed any artifact on DVD or sports. This TV also appears much bigger to people than 32 inches(38 with speakers). Digital cable or Direct Tv are a a must have,along with a progressive scan or HDMI/DVI Dvd player. Ideally the HDMI/DVI player for the best Dvd playback.Update 1/10/06I have had the set over a year, and 3 of my pals with expensive plasma's have bought this as a \"second set.\" Great clear, eyepopping picture from HD sources. The separate box has worked well. I can plug all kinds of things into it without any trouble. Many LCD's are catching up to Sharp, but why kick a winner! Even if you do not choose this LCD, spend the extra for a good name brand. I have seen so many second tier LCD's that artifact during fast motion, push certain color ranges(calibrate people!) and have other annoying faults that pop up. Sharp, Sony, LG, are LCD's I have personally seen in a home setting and looked great. Not to say others are bad, but I only list Brands I have seen in home.", "Date": "October 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Thumbs up", "Author": "DR Moussey", "ReviewID": "RKLKU642LJHEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Please, see my review of the 30 inch model, for details on the Aquos family of Lcd Tv sets.  The 32 inch actually looks signficantly bigger than the 30 inch model.  Is it worth the extra money?  I'm not sure, but Sharp's Aquos line is without doubt the best.  My belief is, if you are going to spend a lot of money, might as well get the best so you don't disappointed.", "Date": "October 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "INCREDIBLE SHARP LCD!", "Author": "James C.

Lawrence", "ReviewID": "R5HCJWAPQKITD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We've had the Aquos TV for a few weeks at this date and are very happy with the picture quality for standard DirecTV, DVD, and PC viewing.  We have not upgraded to an HD feed yet, but we were honestly surprised by the improved picture of standard DirecTV versus our previous television (standard CRT).Pluses:1) We have found the A/V box design to be great for hiding all the input cables.2) Sharp offers a couple of different stretch modes to choose from.3) There are 6 input sources and ability to assign custom names to each.4) The unit remembers the volume, stretch, and picture settings for each input source.  Sounds like a small thing but it is really appreciated by us.5) The Sharp menus and remote are nicely designed.6) Speakers sound good for listening to regular content.7) TV outputs for video capture.8) Aesthetically pleasing.9) Vivid pictures!10) The stand allows the screen to swivel and pivot for optimum positioning.  The degrees of rotational are small but effective.11) Works very well for PC viewing.12) Placement of the control buttons on top of the panel work nice for us.Minuses:1) Only one S-Video input and it is on the front of the A/V box. Won't be an issue after we upgrade our DirecTV receiver but it seems like an oversight not to include one s-Video input on the back of the A/V box.2) 1080p support is questionable.  This may be an issue in the future as true 1080 becomes widely available.  Perhaps the A/V box can be upgraded.3) Expensive.  We originally wanted a 37\" TV but could not justify the price.  However, we were so pleased with all the features mentioned above that we went with the smaller 32\" versus other less expensive products.4) We are not using all input sources, it would be nice if we could disable the unused inputs so they would not appear in the menu.5) Faint fan noise in the A/V box (this is probably a nit, it's only detectable if TV is muted).Thanks to all the previous reviewers on this product and other products.  The customer feedback really helped us make and informed decision.  It can get confusing with all the different display technologies available.  Also, some products have known defects that you will only learn about from internet research.", "Date": "January 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "A excellent all around LCD, cheaper almost better than Sony", "Author": "D.

For features and price, this one is lot better and cheaper.

I love how there is a separate unit to house all the cables.  I think it is a lot smarter to buy this model as opposed to the one with the HDTV tuner built in.  This model is a lot cheaper and Comcast supplied me with a digital cable box with an HDTV tuner built in.  I refuse to watch sports unless it is via HDTV.

I just got the sound back and want to share how i did it (in my case).I bought this TV in late 2004, not from Amazon. The TV over the years has worked fine. A week ago the side speakers attached to the TV monitors lost sound. Luckily i was still able to get sound through external stereo speakers. But it was inconvenient because i could not use the cable remote control to control volume.Initially, i followed the instructions in the manual ('trouble shooting'). One thing to try was to go to Menu (via the TV's the remote control), then Option, then Output Select. But the Output Select was grayed out; i could not get to it. So i just thought the 32\" does not have this option (the manual is for both 32 and 37). i searched the website and got to a forum discussing the no sound problem; some people said the no-sound problem is related to a design flaw, and Sharp will send techinician to fix it for free, even outside the warranty period.So i called Sharp but no such luck. Sharp over the phone made me try various things, including getting to Output Selct, which was grayed out, and they had no clue how to fix that. i specifically asked if i should do anything with the AVC unit; i was told NO. At the end, i was given a Sharp service shop near me, which would cost me $65 minimum (understandable). I decided to do nothing for now; i thought maybe i should just get another TV.Today, God helped me! I read the manual again and decided to press Reset on the AVC system - one reason i never did that was because there is no obvious reset 'button' on the AVC; there is just a small little dot \"inside\". I decided to press the dot with the tip of a letter opener.... the sound came back! i then went to see if Output Select was still grayed out- it is no longer grayed out!!", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor quality, poor service", "Author": "P.
