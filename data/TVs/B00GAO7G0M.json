It took me about a day to find the right settings because I needed to see it in different light, day and night etc.  Items or people in focus are crystal clear, while the background can seem a little grainy if you focus on it.Sound; Boy this was an odd set up.  For the built in speakers, they're pretty good.  Since I live in a townhouse, back facing speakers are not a good idea, since my neighbors can hear as well as I can.  (This applies to bedroom walls too if you mount a TV on opposing walls)  I use a sound bar that projects the sound into our living room and my neighbors hear NOTHING.  That said, this TV has only a single audio coaxial output and there are not many sound systems where that's compatible.  The solution,since we have HD cable, was to wire the sound from the cable box directly to the sound bar (very very simple once I figured that out).  I also had to do the same from our DVD player since we did not want the sound to go through the TV when we watched movies.  Then we simply shut the sound off on the TV by turning the volume all the way down.  Unlike other TVs there is no option to shut off the built in speakers, and pressing \"mute\" on the remote leaves an icon on the screen.The remote;  works very well, but if you use a universal or cable remote it's difficult if not impossible to find a code for this brand.  40 minutes of a search on the remote has yet to reveal a code that works.  I'll keep trying.The stand: Incredibly well built and easy to attach.  Just the base to connect as the trunk or stem is connected right out of the box.The outer frame around the screen is small and not a distraction.  When the TV is off the power light is very bright.  The on-unit controls are on the side on the bottom right.The TV is very thin and for its' size, very lightweight.  31.5 pounds including the box.Overall, for the money, it's well worth it.  I'd like better audio out connections and a remote code, but the picture and price are well worth the buy.Updated 11/6/13:  Found the remote codes!  I have Bright House Networks so the code 0178 worked, but here's what I found from the manufacturer:DIRECTV - 10178Time Warner Cable - 0178Philips - 0002Comcast - 11864 or 10178Cox Communications - 0178Atlas DVR Device URC - 0178Bell Remotes & Dish Network - 505, 506, 516, 523, 526, 566, 573, 612, 627, 647, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 658, 659, 664, 665, 667, 669, 670, 679, 680, 704, 717, 730, 738", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture, Skimpy features - Missing Composite Cable Inputs", "Author": "B.

I had done a lot of research on the TV and read every review on every website selling it as I could. I found that they use Samsung parts and Yamaha audio components, making the decision a little easier.The TV was delivered in just under 48 hours from order time and it appeared to be packed pretty well in it's manufacturer's box. Unpacking and setting up was a breeze. The only complaint I had at this point was that the base went on horizontally skewed and there was nothing I could do about it. At least it was level.The (3) HDMI ports is perfect for our set up (Digital Cable box, Blu-ray and Apple TV). There are component video inputs but no composite so our Wii would need an adapter which I was able to find on Amazon for about $7.I turned it on and programmed our cable remote with the codes from Seiki's site. Everything seemed to be going quite well.The picture quality is excellent. The blacks are very black and there were no bad pixels. The color cast tends toward the blue side and there are no RGB customization settings but I figured as much with this being a lower end TV.You have Standard, Movie and User profiles for your audio and video settings. In these you can choose color temperature sub-settings. I found \"None\" or \"Warm\" to give the best color rendition. I messed with \"User\" a bit but will come back to it when I have time to properly calibrate it.Overall, I think this was a solid purchase. The audio is good, not great but I'm going to be installing a sound bar soon so that doesn't really matter to me right now. Movies look great. HD Cable needs some more calibration but I am thinking that might be the cable box. It's just a little too blue and violets are very, well, violet.I'd recommend this for $339 any day.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A steal at this price", "Author": "jeffliu", "ReviewID": "R3NYB4LPHY86DQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unlike the other reviewer, I have had no issues with pixelation on the screen. I am primarily using this screen for xbox and as a movie screen for my computer, and it has had no trouble displaying 1080p media at the appropriate resolution. Setup is quick, and the screen is incredibly light for its size, so it is very easy to mount onto a wall bracket if you so desire.There is a bit of backlight bleed in one of the corners of the screen, and it is most noticeable in low light settings.

For starters I am a filmmaker/photographer and tech enthusiast. Quality is of the utmost importance to me, I purchased this TV on Wednesday November 27th, 2013 for $229 as a LIGHTNING DEAL. It was the most sought after deal being offered this year and I was lucky enough to get one! My plan was to use this in my living room to view my finished work and watch/play high definition content: Blu-rays, YouTube, Netflix, Gaming, etc.INITIAL SETUP:I own an Early 2013 Retina Macbook Pro which I hooked up to this TV using an HDMI cable. It scaled perfectly through the menu setting \"Just Scan\" without cutting off any of the borders and displayed a beautiful, bright and sharp image after some minor tweaking at 1080p 60Hz. The menu has plenty of adjustable features in the audio, video, functionality department. It is not a SMART TV so it does not have any WiFi or Bluetooth functionality it's USB port WORKS with Google Chromecast!Pros:Thin, sleek glossy finish along the borders and the base for the TV Stand. Super thin. GREAT SOUND. I'd offer is a B+ this TV is LOUD!! it's probably twice as loud and much better sounding than the RCA 40\" speaker bar I bought that I am now returning. There are plenty of adjustable features from color temp, dynamic light control, to audio bass/treble/surround sound. (3) HDMI 1.3 ports, VGA, PC Audio port, Component inputs. L - R Audio inputs and USB input works with Google Chromecast! This TV is wall mountable! I honestly would have paid $500 for this TV which retails for $699 on average and jumps from $500 - $575 on Amazon.Cons:The stand is extremely low quality probably the worst I have ever seen. It is held to the stem of the TV by (6) phillips screws and the TV shakes violently from a simple tap. LED TV's (this being my first) are extremely fragile. No SMART TV features but at a lower than $600 price range and a 50\" size why would you expect to get those features? Not really a CON. That's all!OVERALL: 5/5 Stars absolutely no defects or complaints, amazing packaging TV is flawless and massive, super fast response time, set-up is easy, plenty of input options for AUDIO/VIDEO as well as adjustability through the menu system. I was super impressed with the picture quality and highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 50\" LED under $600. GET IT!!

And what a disappointment it was. There is no backlight control on the video portion of the main menu. Therefore the picture always looks too bright and the colors a bit washed out. I tried turning off the dynamic luminance control which helped a little bit.No RGB control. So this tv at times shows a picture that has too much of a blue or green hue at times. No way to adjust it. Blacks are not deep at all. Picture itself appears grainy even after increasing the sharpness settings.This TV picture is just plain \"off\". You can see the colors are never right, there is always an imbalance of red, green, or blue. Grainy detail in background. And washed out screen overall due too much backlight.These picture quality problems might have been fixed if their proper adjustment options are available. However you will not have access to fix them since you can not make any adjustments to the backlight and RGB levels.This TV has inferior picture quality to my Sceptre 37\" TV and my Insignia 39\" tv and they are no name brand tv's as well. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere if you are looking for a tv with at least \"good\" picture quality. This TV does not meet that requirement. I've chose to return this TV.Update: After doing some research online, I found if you go to the main menu and press four digits 0000 it will take you into a second menu which allows you to adjust the backlight under \"other settings\" and you can also adjust the RGB levels under the \"color temperature\" option. I'm going to try to do some further calibrating before I decide if I am going to return it or not.Update #2: I found another option in the secondary options menu found with code 0000 on the main menu. You go to other options, then video curve this option allows you to make adjustments to the high level of contrast and brightness levels this TV comes with out of the box which causes the washed out picture effect. After decreasing the factory settings for brightness and contrast under Video curve option this TV's picture finally came alive.Contrast pops against a darker background now. No more washed out background. Brightness level is now balanced so TV does not have the gray hazy effect it originally had out of the box.This Tv has good potential. But you have to show alot of patience with adjustments. My main gripe with this TV is all of the adjustment options should have been readily available in the main menu. But alas, if you press OOOO on the main menu, you will have access to all the additional adjustment options you need to get a great picture out of this Tv.Update #3 This TV still shows a grainy picture no matter how high I adjust the sharpness settings. I find myself having to put on my glasses just to watch it which I have never had to do with any other TV. TV can show a good picture at times but the blacks just are not deep. Nightime picture looks grey and washed out. TV's contrast appears dull not matter what the setting. TV has the lowest contrast ratio of any 40\" LED TV I've looked at. I've decided to return this TV last week and I since purchased a Sharp 40\" LED tv. So my journey continues. If the Sharp does not work out I will just pay up and get a Samsung 40\" LED Tv which I know has superior picture quality albeit at a inflated price.

For that price, it is worth it (provided you do not get dead pixels like I did), no questions asked. The picture and the sound are OK. The picture does needs adjusting out of the box, though. I have also already encountered a number of issues that make me question whether the set would be worth it at a higher price:1. No backlight control. Or at least no backlight control without entering the service menu and going to others -> other setting -> backlight (see below), and the TV is very bright by default.2. The QAM tuner (needed for cable without a cable box) is disabled by default! I thought the tuner was broken at first, as the TV can still be set to scan for cable, but it will find nothing by default. I own a Westinghouse set which pulled a similar stunt, but I just had to go to their website to enter the code to enable the tuner in a straightforward manner. I discovered later that the QAM tuner can be enabled in the service menu by going to \"others -> other setting -> Cable QAM\" (see below). It was downright stupid for Seiki to put the option in a dangerous section of the TV (you do not want to play around in the service menu unless you know what you are doing, as you could brick the TV by hitting a wrong option). Worse, there is NO mention of the disabled tuner in the manual or on the set itself, so I am guessing Amazon will see returns from people claiming the tuner is broken.3. The set is very thick as far as LED sets go. If you want a nice-looking thin set, look elsewhere. It is as thick as my old LCD set. At least its design looks nice from the front.4. The biggest issue: There are several clusters of dead pixels on my screen (at least 30(!) dead pixels altogether, in groups of 5+ pixels together). They are small enough to not be seen at a distance and almost unnoticable while gaming/watching television (except on static images), so I do not want to go through the hassle of returning the set and paying $80+ more for a different one. I am guessing that Seiki has poor quality control (as most lower-end brands do). I would definitely return this if I could get another set this cheap, and I know many that would return the set outright.5. If your set breaks outside of the return period, Seiki's warranty service is terrible (YOU pay freight both ways, etc). I think extended warranties usually are not worth it, but if you pay a higher price for this set it may be worth looking into.6. No smart features, 120hz/240hz, 3D, internet, or anything else. This is a bare-bones 1080p TV. If you want something else, look elsewhere. I did not deduct any stars for this.7. Poor black levels and mediocre sound (but who buys a TV for its speakers?),Service Menu: At your own risk, to enter the service menu, press menu on the included remote. Once it pops up, press 0 four times to enter the service menu; Do NOT adjust settings or enter menus within the service menu if you are unsure of what they do. Most stuff you want to adjust (backlight, tuner, etc) is in the \"other\" section.One last tip: The TV's glass stand comes with an annoying sticker on it. It does not come off easily at all.

That did not happen and Amazon did a pretty nice job working with me on the issue, issued me a minor credit towards my next purchase, and called me a few days later to ensure I received my shipment and that everything was OK.  That was a nice touch.  Life happens.As for the television - I am very pleased with the purchase.  Out of the box, the picture is excellent, bright, and vivid.  I have not made a single adjustment to the picture and don't really feel it needs it.  The television was purchased primarily as a set for my kids to play video games, watch movies, and for me to occasionally watch sports when/if the other larger television in our home is being used!The sound is a different story and is why I am giving the set only four stars.  The sound is weak, not quite loud enough, but not so horrible I would send the set back.  Going from volume level one to 50 is almost unnoticeable and even turned up almost to the loudest setting is not at all loud by loud standards.  I am considering a sound bar but probably won't buy one.  If you keep the bass turned down in the audio settings, the set sounds OK but not great.Overall, the television really is a steal for the money.  Hands down the best deal I've found for a television of this size in the market today.  I have other name brand flat screens in our home, i.e. Mitsubishi, Vizio, and Samsung, and this television's picture is absolutely on par with those name brands mentioned.And at this price, the risk in purchasing is minimal and time will tell if the internal circuitry is on par with the competition.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazon doesn't pack tv's for safe shipping", "Author": "Roger Lodge", "ReviewID": "R33MZ0HWYRM3UM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I was really excited to get a new tv. This one was on sale for $330. I took it out of the box and started attaching the stand. The screws wouldn't go all the way in, leaving the stand loose. I really tried to crank the screws down but they would only go so far. Then I took the plastic wrap off the screen and saw that the screen had cracks in the corner and the center of it was crushed.I shop a lot on Amazon and every item I order is put in a shipping box with extra packing material. This tv was shipped in ONLY it's retail box, which does not suffice when going through Fedex. This tv should've been put in a shipping box when sent to me to survive the throwing & stacking that shipped packages go through.To make matters worse, I got a refund and I can't get this tv again because it now costs $600.When it comes to sensitive electronics such as this, I'm going to a local store.

Nothing against Seiki, but picture quality could be equalled AND you could get a legitimate stand. The stand on this Seiki frankly sucks (wobbles).My TV arrived in the retail box (no double boxing!) and appeared to have been repackaged. On powering it up and feeding it a pure white 1920x1080 image, I noticed 1 dead pixel on outer left edge towards the bottom. The settings out of the box are garbage. Red gain is cranked way too high. Fortunately if you are willing to go into the service mode, you can bump the backlight down (as well as RED GAIN) and achieve much better color accuracy. I listened to the speakers in the TV for a while, they sound above average. Most (including myself) are going to go with audio out to proper speakers.Pro's:  Decent picture  Blu-rays and PS4 look especially crisp, OTA HD looks ok, SD material is passable  I prefer the digital coax connection over optical due to the run to my AV gear (15')  Looks wise, this set looks pretty slick imo  Reasonably thin panel  Wall mountable  Input lag appears to be very low (action games in PS4 felt on par with my 3.5ms BenQ projector).Con's:  The stand is cheap. Even screwed on (6 SCREWS!!) the set still wobbles.  Dialing in colors MANDATES one to go into the service mode due to a lack of settings in the menu  Not everyone can enjoy the bargain us lucky ones got on Black FridayAll in all, I would buy this set again for myself at any price south of $350.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Seiki SE46FY10 46-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV (Black)", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R1GUKWO90CF2L0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on thanksgiving, during that time there was about 20 reviews and they were all optimistic with only a couple complaining about dead pixels so i took a chance. OnTrac didn't ship until the following Monday and I got it on Wednesday. During this time there were about 50 reviews and many people were complaining about broken screens and dead pixels so I was worried,When I received my package, OnTrac did a good job, there weren't any punctures or tears in the box, and the TV and contents were all in working condition. No dead pixels, screen cracks or tears, or broken anything... Now I have a 2012 54\" 1080p 240Hz LED back-lit Sony Bravia in the living room, but this TV is replacing my older 2009 32\" 720p LCD from Costco, so I know what quality looks like.Initial setup was simple and easy, there are a lot of settings to adjust the TV color, brightness, etc. but certain settings are blocked out. Don't know why people are complaining about the remote, it's nice and small compared to most major brands, and doesn't have random buttons you don't need. Compared to my '09 LCD, the picture is great! The colors stand out more and with a little tweaking around, it really stands out. I would compare this TV to other TVs in the $500-$800 price range. The antennae picks up the same amount of channels as my old LCD, and the HD channels look way better, the 1080p really stands out for this size, compared to 720p.I mostly use this TV for gaming and with my computer (I use an HDMI splitter for my computer monitor so I can view stuff on the TV, better than lugging a laptop around.) The quality is great, It's not a $1000+ TV, but honestly it's hard to tell the difference unless you're TRYING to, like I think most other reviewers are doing.Overall, this TV is well worth the money, the picture quality is nice (I would compare it to LG, Samsung, Sharp, etc.), the unit looks sleek and its not that heavy, I use different speakers so I don't know about the sound but even high end units don't sound that well. and If it was still on sale i'd recommend this to any of my friends.If any problems occur, i'll edit my review.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "$229 for a 50?!", "Author": "Pissed", "ReviewID": "R1LFRNY65UYPRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got this for $229 on black friday!picture is clear and shipping was quick with prime!very nice budget tv for the price even without black friday deal", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - Horrible Customer Service If Nothing Else.", "Author": "Jennifer Thomas", "ReviewID": "R10C6HLB6G30SC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This rating may be subject to change, but for now I am pretty thoroughly displeased. I have had this television all of two hours now. The box was a little beat up when it arrived, but nothing too terrible, the TV inside the box looked fine so it appeared that the packaging had done it's job of protecting the television. I set the television up and got it working, the picture was a tiny bit off but nothing that couldn't be adjusted, and then it worked for all of about an hour and a half. Now my television is sitting there with a black screen, even though the blue power light comes on. Now, when I try to get a hold of customer service for Seiki, I can't. The first attempt at calling them, I got a recording that said the customer service was experiencing a high call volume and I would have to hold. I did, for about 30 minutes, and then for some reason I was directed to an answering machine that just said to leave a message. I have no idea who I was leaving a message with, but I did. When I try to call back, now their customer service just goes straight to that message.As an addendum: Amazon's technical department was awesome and tried to troubleshoot what they could. When they couldn't get the TV to work either, they determined it must be a defective model and are shipping out a new one, so Amazon has done wonderfully, but I will leave my review about the quality of the TV (and Seiki's customer service, who still hasn't called back several hours later) until the new one arrives and works, you know, for more than an hour.A further addendum: Amazon was awesome, they made it easy to return the other TV, and the replacement arrived quickly. Thus far the replacement has worked, though it's only been a month so I'm still wary. The bad part is that Seiki customer service never called back or contacted me in any way, so I don't hold my breath that should anything go wrong, I'll get it resolved. I've upped my rating to a wary three stars, but if the TV holds up I might change it to four stars.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "46\" Yay!!", "Author": "Alexander Lopez \"El Conquistador\"", "ReviewID": "R3HWBRTIYRKUQU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "46\" Arrived real quick!

For a 46\" television I cannot complain about the price it goes in my bedroom and everything works fine.  I got it because it was inexpensive, bare bones with HDMI inputs and I needed to put my Google Chromecast to some use.  I have a couple of complaints however.  Why did I need to call Seiki customer service in order to \"unlock\" the tuner so that it would pick up my cable stations?  Why then did I have to send an email with the model number to a gmail address in order to get the code to unlock the tuner so that it would find my cable stations?  I must say that this annoyed me a little bit.  I have never had this experience with any other television I have ever purchased.  On the bright side, the process wasted only about 45 minutes of my time, about an half hour to determine I wasn't doing anything wrong, and 15 minutes to call and get the code.  The television now works great and only cost about $350 bucks (currently the price of many much smaller flat screens at Wal-Mart).  I recommend, as long as you realize you might have to go through the setup and call Seiki to get the email address to get the unlock code.  Heck, even if you don't I would go ahead and do it in case you need it in the future.

I opened the package in front of the FedEx driver to inspect for damage and found the screen to be busted.  I didn't even remove it from the box to see how bad, I just ran my hand down the inside of the box across the screen and could feel the plastic gouged so I refused the shipment.I immediately jumped online to file for a replacement and was heartbroken when I found out that my only option was a refund since the unit was not in stock.  I waited til later in the day and tried again and was happy to see that I could then file for a replacement.  It arrived on Tuesday, double-boxed, in excellent condition.I pulled the new set out of the box, attached the stand, and turned it on to test it out and immediately found there to be a 4 or 5 inch line of dead pixels in the lower right side of the screen.  I have now filed for another replacement so hopefully by tomorrow I will have a fully functioning TV.Amazon's customer service is the best and easiest I've ever had to deal with so they get 5-stars for that.**UPDATE**I finally have a working 50\" TV that I only paid $229 for.

This has to be the best deal ever, when you consider its value.  The design of the TV isn't really special but good enough.

After proper calibrating the image quality (brightness, contrast, color, etc), this TV really shines for its price!  I've been watching blu-rays and playing PS3 games, and it's been great.  Oh, there are a couple of issues I discovered during calibration:1. Tint-  It's a bit on the red side.2.

Movies look great, but I have noticed it doesn't handle fast movement well. It's not so bad when watching a film, but if it's a cartoon (ie Adventure Time) it is obvious. It has this ghost effect that leaves an image of the previous frame for a split second. Even then, it's not a huge problem. Video games (360) have a similar effect, but like movies, it's not as bad/obvious. So far I've tested Skyrim, GTA 5, and FEZ. All of them look great!Sound Quality: This is why I'm giving it 4 stars. The sound quality is not so great. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not as good as the audio on the TV that we replaced.

It is something that you could get used to, and if you have a sound bar then there should be no worries. TIP: If you do end up getting a sound bar, make sure you have the proper connections. The only audio input that is dedicated for external speakers is a \"coaxial\" port. No optical input, unfortunately, but you can get an optical to coaxial adapter.Build Quality: It looks /really/ nice. It feels sleek and modern, and looks great mounted on the wall. Surprisingly, the TV itself is super light, a lot lighter than our old 32 in LCD. The glass stand is a nice touch, and looks really nice. Word of advice: If you do want to mount the TV on a wall using a mount you already have, you will probably need to get smaller or bigger bolts. The ones we used on our old TV were too big for this one, so we had to find smaller ones. We bought 10-24 x 1 sized bolts, but they didn't want to go in all the way, so a size down from that should do the trick. Still not sure the right size, since we happened to find ones that fit (with added washers).I still have a bit of testing to do (playing some BF3 on it) so I'll cut this review short. I will be back in a bout a week to update. Enjoy your new TV!

I did a lot of research on this brand because frankly I had never heard of it. I read all these phenomenal reviews about how simple it was and how great the picture and sound quality were, so I was really excited when I picked it up from HHGregg. Out of the box the TV looked great, but when I hooked everything up the sound was not playing though the TV. After a hopeless conversation with Seiki's customer service, who insisted I just ship it back to them, and hours of research I discovered that I had to manually reset a setting on my cable box so that the Seiki could understand it.Not two weeks after the initial audio issue another problem occurred. The TV would randomly shut off only when it seemed like the least opportune time for it to shut off. Once again I called Seiki just for them to tell me that the TV was fine and that I should just turn off my DLC (dynamic light control). So I did, and sure enough the problem persisted. I really didn't want to deal with the hassle of shipping it back to Seiki so I decided to just put up with the random shut offs.After three grueling months of the aggravating shut offs I noticed a little black dot on the right hand side of the TV. I didn't think anything of it, and though that maybe it was just poor broadcasting. Sure enough it WASN'T and within a few days that black dot became a strip of dead pixels about inch long, and after days turned into weeks the inch long strip now reaches almost across the entire screen.At that point I had enough of this unreliable pesky TV so I called Seiki to make a claim on their One-Year warranty. This warranty would be great barring a few issues. First of all they want to send me a refurbished TV instead of a new one, and secondly they want ME to pay for the shipping! Shipping from Tallahassee, Fl to CALIFORNIA! The cheapest shipping option I could find was $180, which is practically HALF of what the TV cost me! There is NO WAY I'm paying $180 to get a refurbished TV to replace one that practically came broken.I've been calling them for hours at a time for about a week and I have yet to speak with someone personally. I've actually spent two hours on hold in total waiting for someone to at least answer. This is probably the most unprofessional company to work with. I've never been so dissatisfied with any product in my life. Thanks for the birthday gift Seiki, I would have appreciate a punch to the stomach instead of this HEADACHE.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Broken TV, non-existant customer support.", "Author": "Harry", "ReviewID": "RIUA6F2U2XVTS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The TV arrived broken even though the packaging it was in was fine.

Right now I use it for basic cable, PS3, PC games I use a controller with, and the PS4 in the future.  It's a great quality television for the price!  My only drawback is that this TV is not picking up any digital channels, while my brother's 32inch Vizio in his room is picking up 16, both televisions are splitting one cable, this maybe because my cable cord is over 20 feet and my brother's is maybe about 4 feet long, we're using custom cut coaxial cords.  But the standard definition cable quality is just fine for me!  All using the default settings, but plugged into a sound system through the 3.5mm headphones output.  This model doesn't have optical for audio, but it does have coaxial, so if you're looking for a sound system too, which I recommend as the speakers aren't very good for my taste, make sure it supports coaxial!  If you have a speaker system that only has optical, don't think you're outta luck as I'm pretty sure that converters exist!  :)", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "I have NEVER experienced WORSE customer service in my ife", "Author": "Paul DeLucia", "ReviewID": "RS2AY3BMNHG21", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered a Seiki product and after 9 months, the audio/visual ports stopped working. We contacted the company and after talking to a tech support rep, we instructed to ship it back to them (at our own expense) and they would ship us a new one because our malfunctioning unit was still under their \"great\" 1 year warranty.We shipped it to their location in Mississippi (at a personal cost of $120) We were initially instructed to email the tracking number to the rep we had originally spoken with to speed up the process of them shipping us the new one. We shipped out the originally TV on Nov. 20th.  We never received any confirmation that they had received the number or later the product until we called 2 weeks later. After being on hold for 30+min on several occasions (most times we were sent to voice-mail) we were told everything was in line to ship and to expect our new TV within 7-14 business days. After two more weeks, we called back. still no TV. we were told that they no longer made our model and we would have to wait until a refurbished model was available. Already having waited a month for this replacement, we refused to accept this and finally got a supervisor to approve an upgrade to the next size up. We have since been waiting for the replacement, approaching two months now. Every time we have called, we are told its waiting to be shipped or they are backed up and it will take up to 5 weeks to ship or their warehouse is out of stock. Every time a new story.

I got it brand new from someone on Craigslist ($250!!!). This TV is fantastic for a basic living room setup. I use it as an external monitor for Netflix and other videos playing from my MacbookPro. I was actually looking at more prominent brands like Samsung and LG but I just couldn't pull the trigger on those price tags.I cannot comment on quality with actual cable or satellite TV because I don't have either. I use it exclusively with my MBP. So the quality is directly related to the originating video. Any HD video is absolutely beautiful, no pixelation whatsoever. Lesser quality videos like 360 will reflect pixelation but it also shows up on my MBP so it has nothing to do with the tv. As others have mentioned, there is some backlight bleeding with dark scenes but it is nothing too bad.Sound is adequate but not the best. I can live with it but there is a clear quality issue with the speakers, no matter what settings. But for $250 I am just happy that the picture is perfect.

Great for that price.  The sound takes some adjusting.  The speakers are in the back.  We first had this TV in our basement and the sound was good because it was against the wall and it was a small room.  The TV has now replaced our main one because it died.  I had to adjust all of the furniture to get the TVs back against the wall to reflect the sound out into the room.  Originally it was in a corner and that didn't work well.  There are adjustments that can be done in the settings which help.  Someday we might pick up a soundbar to see if that helps.  The picture is good for HD.  The picture for standard def shows is really grainy and fuzzy.

A secondary brand like this is often a \"hit or miss\". It either arrives and works great or it's dead on arrival. And the DOA rate for the so called \"disposable TV's\" tend to be pretty high. Thankfully, mine came without any issues.Pro's:Picture is clear (if not as good as more expensive TV's). It will definitely impress anyone upgrading from an older TV. However, if you're used to the more recent models from a top brand you may notice a slight decrease in picture quality.Easy to use. There aren't very many settings so it's mostly just plug and watch. Take 10 minutes to calibrate the picture to your tastes and then sit back.3 HDMI's. As someone who only had one on his old TV this is a major upgrade and is often plenty for every day use. For example it'll fit your DVR, Blu-Ray, and sound system without a problem.Con'sPrice. When on sale it's a steal. At it's every day price it's a little high for a secondary brand at this size. If you keep your eyes out you can usually find a 50\" around $400 almost all year round. So may not be worth the cost until the price drops.60 Hz. While 4k is more or less useless for the human eye, 120 Hz is not. If you like your sports you may wish to wait to find something at the 120 Hz level. Most of us are used to 60 Hz and won't find much of a problem here though. Still, beware of that.Audio connections. This TV does not have an optical audio connection (the primary method to connect budget sound systems). It has a digital coax output and the stand L/R components.

I must say, there really isnt a lot of motion blur at all for being a 60 hz.  But the main reason I wanted to post this review is to mention this has a matte screen, or an anti-glare screen if you will, meaning there are not a lot of reflections in a bright room.  Also, the tv is much nice that I expected, much nicer than the small Dynex we have.  The base is quite heavy, and holds the tv well.  It is not tiltable though.Regarding pixelation:  Make sure to use HDMI cable only, and make sure you receiver is set to output at 720p and 1080i/p.  Otherwise, you may be viewing a 480i picture.  The noise-reduction is set at medium when new.  Good idea to keep it there, as it keeps the picture nice and quiet.Black levels are not the best.  Liveable, but not great.  Contrast is really good.  The picture is a bit bloomy sometimes, but doing a careful calibration really helps that.

They suggested that I have amazon replace the TV, which I ended up doing. The new TV arrived quickly and wasn't missing any pieces. The stand wasn't too hard to attach, now that the screw holes actually lined up.Next I adjusted the picture settings. I can't remember everything I changed, but I did turn it off energy star mode, which according to some other reviews I've read, will greatly improve the picture.The picture quality is great, but there were a couple minor blemishes between the LCD screen and the front of the TV. They're black, about a pixel in size each, and are invisible from some viewing angles. I also can't see them from 5+ feet away from the TV.

The new one arrived promptly and I took it to her and we hooked it up.  This time though the remote would not work.  Not only would it not work, but the battery cover would not stay on because the tab was broke. So I used the side buttons to get everything set up.  I thought I could call customer service and they would send me a remote.  No big deal, just an inconvenience.  The next morning, this TV quit working the same as the last one.  I did call their customer service from work and described the problem and the rep said that it sounded like I had been sent 2 defective TV's and needed to send it back.

When I call back, they appear to be out of stock of this kind of TV in their warehouse and offer me an upgrade. Happily, I agree.Fast forward another month, and apparently the warehouse is so backed up that they can't give me any sort of estimate as to the arrival time of the TV nor its status. Their people in customer service are great, but if this is how they treat new TVs and people who are attempting to get one replaced, this almost becomes not worth it with the risk involved.Will change review when I receive new TV, depending on time frame.**UPDATE**I have received a new replacement TV, they have upgraded me to a 50\" 4k UHD TV which works like a charm.
