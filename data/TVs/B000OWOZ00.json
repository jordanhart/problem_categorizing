Just what I was looking for.", "Author": "Jeddy", "ReviewID": "R1UM83S48RD832", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Read the product description. What you see is what you get. This is my first thin/flat-screen tv and I love it. My ONLY complaint with it is the viewing angle. I have it hanging on the wall in my bedroom, and if you are looking at it even from slightly below-center, it is very difficult to see things if there is a dark scene in whatever you're watching (such as a night-time scene). Because I cheaped out and bought the non-swivel wall mount, I just hung it super low to the ground so I was looking at it straight-on while in bed. If you get the swivel wall mount, or just use the included stand, you probably won't have such problems. Anyway, I don't know if this tv is even made anymore, but I do recommend it.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great TV for the money", "Author": "Vince Pardue", "ReviewID": "RQFYV1IE77B60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with my Magnavox TV. It was easy to set-up and even shipped a little earlier than I expected. The picture and sound are very clear and I love the thin body style. This is a nice TV for the money. I'd recommend it to others and buy another Magnavox TV if I needed a new set.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow, what a nice TV for my Florida room.", "Author": "Gen Ludivicious Viele \"Finkenjk\"", "ReviewID": "R36YNI8FMWKL6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to demonstrate Karaokes that I have from the Philippines. I did not intend to use it for watching TV alone.  But when I first turned it on, setup was automatic, and the quality of the picture was beyond reproach.  Now I use it exclusively for watching TV over a much larger TV in an air-conditioned room.  That is how truly good this TV is.  At one time, I thought Magnavox TVs were of poor quality, but so far this TV is just as good as a Panasonic or Sony.The quality of the sound could be improved, but I am running the sound through wireless earphones and/or a stereo shelf system which I also bought from Amazon.com.  I will review the shelf system and wireless earphones in another post.Overall, I could not be more happy with this TV or with Amazon on this particular purchase.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "26\" LCD HDTV with ATSC/Qam tuner\n1366 x 768p HD resolution\nVGA input to connect to your PC\n160 degree viewing angle side to side plus 160 degree vertical\n2 Component and 2 S video inputs", "Name": "Magnavox 26MF337B 26-Inch LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41i5vfmYDFL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000OWOZ00"}}
