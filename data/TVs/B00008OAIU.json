Howery", "ReviewID": "R3P1EU8L2AYMX3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As mentioned in another review, the lamp has a limited life, I got more than the other reviewer, 5yr, but its still $200 and some inconvienence to replace, not the replacment itself but getting the part to the TV.Another problem I've noticed is that the audio quality is very poor. Either too muffled or female news comentator voices too tinny. I always though Sony audio would be outstanding but this is not. I have to run the audio through the stereo to get acceptable sound.It's very unlikely that this TV is available anymore as Sony dropped it ASAP.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Manufacturer defect", "Author": "Sandra M.

Kushnerova", "ReviewID": "R2F8N7R3ID0U6I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The TV is great great picture quality and great features. It's everything you want plus more. There is one catch through which is that because this is a LCD tv the lamp burns out and you must replace it every year which i have to do. The lamp costs 200$ which is alot of money so unless you dont want to pay that and go through the trouble of buying a lamp buy another tv", "Date": "January 7, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Sony 50'' XBR Grand Wega Widescreen Rear Projection LCD HDTV Monitor (kf-50xbr800)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q1P094SXL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00008OAIU"}}
