The design is very minimalist and nice to look at when the set is off.  Picture quality for an inexpensive tv (I paid under $200) is very good.  Sound quality is a bit tinny, but you can use the earphone jack to hook up to computer or home theater speakers.  Remote is easy to use and screen functions are easy to follow.  All in all, I think it is a great value.  I don't plan to use it for my computer, so the other review complaints listed on this page are irrelevant for me.  If you need a small HD LED set, for a small room or kitchen, make sure you give this set a look.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "i bought this refurbished by sansui, but it came as new", "Author": "G.

We wanted a to replace an older Sony CRT in bedroom with an LED TV and not spend a lot.  For a bit over a hundred bucks (after waiting outside the store on a blustery cold morning) we got a pretty nice 22\" TV.  The color and brightness were set way too high from factory, but after setting picture to our taste the TV has worked flawlessly.  The remote is nice also - laid out so you can do the usual stuff easily in a dark room.Have since moved to a rural home with an indoor over-the-air antenna and are happy with it's performance there also.  The TV's speakers are not great but with the headphone output and a good pair of computer speakers the sound is great.Does not have a USB input.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "High hopes, dashed shortly after turning on. Limited color shades and poor VGA/HDMI resolution support", "Author": "ND Consumer", "ReviewID": "R1TQSDWEGEDEK4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This TV was a black friday special at an upper-midwest home improvement chain. It was a 1080 panel in 22\" size with LED backlight for 20% less after rebate than what others were charging for a 720 panel in 19\" size with CFL backlight.We waited in line and missed getting one by just 5 minutes on that late cold November morning.  I was pleasantly surprised when I returned to the store just after new years when they were doing 11% off everything and spotted a single box burried along with other panels.  It's price had gone up by 50% of the black friday price, but still about half what it was currently going for online.So, after the additional discount on the purchase it was only 25% higher than black friday so it was worth a shot...or so I thought.The unit is sleek, thin and light. The 'no-pressure' sensitive controls on the bottom of the frame are nice..no hard pressing which is good on a very light set.However, that's where the pro's end. As a summary of what follows below, suffice it to say this is a very poor quality set.  I wasn't expecting a lot but was left very disappointed and the unit was returned less than 24 hours after purchase.Specific cons:* It's clearly TN panel technology, no surprise at the pricepoint I paid. At full price one would hope it would be PVA/MVA or IPS, cause you can get that in the 22\" Panny line (albiet 720p) for less than this thing sells for 'normally'. It actually had pretty decent side viewing angles, helped by the very bright LED backlight.  Vertical viewing angles above were average, vertical viewing angles below were horrible, going negative image quite quickly when looking up at it just below the bottom of the frame.* The screen was significantly overdriven and most everything looked clay-mation like. Bumping down various settings like contrast, backlight and others helped some but not enough. 1080i HD was very noisy (fringy and pixelated with any motion). The 480i subchannels were very poorly stretched (but I'm used to a 42\" and 50\" 720p Panny plasma for better SD scaling)* When connected to a PC via VGA cable, I didn't expect it to do better than 1280x768, but it basically topped out at 1024x768 (usable) instead. I could get it do a few random odd sizes above that up to around 1600x900.  Running Nokia monitor check with the alterating grey patterns showed significant VGA noise on most scaled frequencies. Shaking pixels to strange pink/green color banding.* When connected to a PC via HDMI cable (2 different PCs, desktop with ATI graphics and laptop with Intel HD integrated), I fully expected it to do 1920x1080 since it's a 1080p panel (or so it claims). What I found seems to indicate otherwise.- 1920x1080, while displayed, produced significant noise around all letters, with or without clear type enabled.- 1440x900 or 1360x768 with the monitor set to 'native' showed perfectly with a large black border but very good sharp pixels.- These 2 resolutions set to 'full' stretched to the edges and looked acceptable, though a bit soft.- All other resolutions caused either offset drawing (large black edge on left) or shimmering text everywhere, or a very soft expanded screen.For what I saw, if I am to believe that this is a 1080p panel with native resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, I believe the internal interfaces and scalers must be capped out at 1440x900 or possibly 1360x768 meaning they were designed for smaller resolution panels and simply stuck in this driving a larger screen, basically ensuring you are stuck with stretched 720 image, not appreciating the full 2 million pixels 1080 gives you.* Finally, when running at any resolution, including seemingly 1:1 non stretched, the limitations of the TN panel were immediately apparent. Running a video from the computer showed people with light redish highlight on their face or nose from lighting on my IPS computer monitor caused it to show very pronouced HOT FLUORESCENT PINK/PURPLE blobs on this monitor (Think 70's blacklight art!).  That's partially thanks to the 6 bit per color per pixel of an TN panel giving 262 thousand colors instead of 8 bpp of better panel types giving 16 million colors. However this was so bad it seemed the processor was doing something really bad to everything being fed to it.I didn't test any of the other inputs. If VGA and HDMI are poor, I can only imagine what s-video and composite fed into it may have looked like. I wanted to like this so much for the price but with multiple issues I could not justify keeping it.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent T.V, but bad monitor.", "Author": ":)", "ReviewID": "R28WVAZIK0434P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i your planning on buying it for what it was made for, than its a decent cheap t.v.
