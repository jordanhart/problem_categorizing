Onscreen display guides through the basics of source and internet connections.  It did have some issues connecting via WiFi.  My wireless router is dual band with both 2.4 and 5GHz bands with the same SSID.  I ended up having to rename the 5GHz band SSID in my router before the TV would connect.  *Update* 03/30/2014  We ended up connecting the TV via hardwired connection to the network for higher bandwidth streaming 3D playback as the WiFi could not keep up.Initial picture quality is amazing.  This is coming from someone who has been used to watching a smaller and much earlier model of LCD HD TV.  The contrast between lights and darks and the details that can be seen in high contrast scenes is something I noticed right off.  The 3D demos available on the TV also looked amazing as did a couple I tried from Netflix.  The simulated 3D looked surprisingly good as well, testing it on a couple of video sources.  I'm not sure I would want to watch most shows this way, but it works better than I would have thought.  I have yet to calibrate this TV properly, but will update when I have a chance to delve into the advanced settings more thoroughly.*Update* 03/30/2014Had a chance to do a full calibration with a colorimeter.  The 10-point white balance worked very well requiring significant adjustments to red and some to blue above 50%, although there was not a significant difference in grays at each step < 50%, while grays above 50% were fairly similar as well.  The 2 point calibration would probably get most people close enough.  That said, once the 10-point was complete, the white balance looked fantastic at all levels.  Color was only slightly off from factory defaults at 100%.  Lower % values varied a bit, but I did not mess with trying to adjust these because I believe it would require access to the service menu.  Sharpness was best at < 10.  Much more introduced significant moire effects in test patterns. When viewing full screen grays, there is visible light falloff in the corners of the TV and there is a kind of stage curtain effect at even points across the top and bottom of the screen.  I don't know the technical name for this, but it is like stage lights shining up and down from the bottom and top.  This must be due to the way they redirect the edge lighting, and is probably common for most edge lit LED TVs.  It is not noticeable during regular viewing.  After a full calibration, this TV looks even better than it did initially.  No serious complaints from me on picture quality.The remote has been redesigned from the 2013 models which I had considered buying, but did not like because of the lack of play/pause/FF/RW buttons.  Samsung has added these buttons to this model and it works very well.  The Wii like feature of pointing and clicking works okay, but sometimes the cursor and the remote get way out of sync and are not pointing at the same spot.  I quickly learned that having your finger (or thumb) from the touch pad activates the cursor and removing and retouching the pad resets the cursor.  Overall this work fairly well.  The cursor does not appear to work in the Apps though.  Netflix and Amazon Instant video still requires using the arrow keys to navigate and you must bring up the pop-up on-screen remote to use the keys that are not on the physical remote.  This is a mild inconvenience.  I would personally have preferred that the remote be larger and include all the buttons.This TV will primarily be used for streaming video through Netflix, Amazon, etc so these features were of prime concern.  As noted above, the remote doesn't seem to work the same in the apps.  Otherwise, Netflix and Amazon both played  wonderful looking HD video.  One item I did notice was that Netflix was much darker than all the other sources and apps and I had to turn up the back-light for just this app.  Not sure why this is yet.  Once, during an Amazon Prime Video playback the sound cut off for no apparent reason.  I tried closing the app and restarting but then realized the sound on the entire TV was out, not just in the app.  I had to power off the TV and power it back on to get sound back.*Update* 03/30/2014I have also tried Hulu and Vudu apps.  Hulu has some issues properly refreshing the list of videos after using the back button.  There also seem to be some issues during peak times with playback at 3.2Mb/s quality setting.  There were no problems streaming at this setting the other night, but today it keep having to pause to buffer the video.  Once the setting was lowered to 2Mb/s there were no more issues.  This was not our connection as we were getting 50+Mb/s through several test sites around the U.S. at that time.  I suspect this is a bandwidth issue on Hulu's end.  Also tried a couple movies on Vudu with no issues.  Very nice looking 3D as well.Other Apps:  I only briefly played with other apps, including the web browser.  After opening the web browser, the first thing I did was set the search engine to Google from the Bing default.  As soon as I entered a search the browser crashed and I had to restart it.  I attempted to search again and the entire TV froze and required a power cycle to get it working again.  I haven't been back to try the browser again.  *Update* 03/30/2014  Browser still has issues.  I was able to go to a couple sites today, but it eventually locked up the entire TV and only by unplugging the TV could I get it to do anything.  There haven't been any software updates that I have seen yet, but its only been a week.Summarizing my initial impressions: The picture seems great.  Software is buggy.  At least software can be fixed with updates.  Hopefully Samsung will address these issues.  I will try and update this review as I use the TV more.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good TV", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R31KQ16V1JLN0H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good TV for a great price.

At first, I was not too optimistic that this TV would stack up against my previous screen; but from the moment I started unboxing this TV, I was pleasantly surprised.  It is less than half the weight of my old Pioneer, has a much thinner bezel, and has many features included in its operating software, such as streaming on-demand content and a variety of apps.  It left me amazed at how fast technology has advanced, to make this not only technically superior to my previous TV, but a fraction of the retail price.A setup \"wizard\" provided simple, step-by-step setup. The picture has beautiful contrast, colour, and brightness, and is completely flicker-free when viewing 2D content, due to a very high refresh rate of 120Hz. The TV comes with two remote controls, one, a traditional push-button remote, and a \"smart\" remote, which almost completely eliminates buttons in favour of a touchpad, and also includes a microphone for voice-control of the television.  I've tried the voice control and found it to be a bit of a gimmick, rather than something I'd choose to use consistently; but the touchpad control is simple, intuitive, and completely eliminates any need to look at the remote control while using it, let alone hunt for the right button on a cluttered remote control keypad.I was so impressed with this television unit that I have paired it with a Samsung 3D Blu-Ray player, as well as a Samsung tablet and smartphone.  This ecosystem allows me to control my television and Blu-Ray player using my mobile devices, view my TV content on my tablet wherever I may be in the house, and optimise viewing of Blu-Ray content as the player and television can be set up to \"talk\" to one another and optimise settings accordingly.I would certainly recommend this television to others, especially others who are passionate about image quality, or who have an older television and are considering an upgrade.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture, Amazing 3D!", "Author": "R. Keene", "ReviewID": "R14KCJHXTG08VY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a bit of a techno-file and this TV was an upgrade from a 6 year old 46\" Samsung LCD. Anytime you purchase a TV these days you roll the dice a bit as far as quality of your particular set. I'm happy to say in my case I have no issue. I don't even have issues I expected I would.I have...No stuck or dead pixels No flashlighting at all. No clouding, a dark screen is perfectly even. Colors are accurate and vibrant. I disabled the eco-sensor right away since it dimmed the screen far too much.The menu system is very full featured with just about every setting or feature you can think of easily modified.Blacks are not perfect but they are far better than most LCD's. I am fairly critical and the black level is perfectly acceptable.I did notice a very minor case of the Dirty Screen Effect. However 99% of the time it can't be seen at all.The SMART features are very well implemented. Youtube streams perfectly and apps open up and navigate with reasonable speed. I was able to plug a USB into the TV and watch the HD videos taken with my Sony camcorder as well as other video files with no issue. This is a big convenience.I must confess I do love 3D,and this sets 3D is amazing!  The 3D experience varies by source type. A good 3D Blu-ray is every bit as good as the theater. The first 3D Blu-ray movie I played was Prometheus and it was spectacular! The detail is so razor sharp and yet with good depth and pop. In viewing store demo's I really thought I preferred the passive 3D more than the active but I wouldn't want to lose any of that beautiful detail this set can deliver. Active it is then! The glasses are very light weight and fit over my prescription glasses very comfortably. It's not a feature that I will use very often but when a movie I want to see comes out in 3D, that's what I'm going to watch, It really is as good as the theater.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "I hate to give it a single star...  but damn...", "Author": "danb", "ReviewID": "RNL0VUE36JFUN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love Samsung TV's and habitually buy them.  This model is the first time I have been disappointed.My previous TV is the H6350 from last year.  It was totally fine, I just really wanted to be able to use soundshare functionality with a samsung sound bar I purchased (I bought the samsung sound bar at Costco thinking it was compatible...  nope).  I was able to use that TV for another purpose and bought the H6400 which is compatible with sound share.The remote sucks.  Right off the bat I find it annoying, and at times it takes longer to do things than the previous models remote.  The back button on the remote simply doesn't work...  this really sucks when you select something in Netflix and need to go back.  Currently when I need to \"go back\" in Netflix I am hitting the smart TV button to go back to the main menu then opening Netflix, then selecting the other item I was trying to get to.  This obviously isn't going to work, I need a replacement remote.What is worse than the remote?  The stand the TV sits on.  I have triple checked it; it is correctly attached to the TV.  The TV leans backwards about an inch.  I also noticed it is a little crooked, about a quarter of an inch higher on the left side.  After checking the mount 3 times, screwing and unscrewing, the holes that I screw the mount into appear to have stripped.  The holes are way too large for the screws, I was very careful because I noticed this the first time so I hand screwed the stand to the mount very carefully.  The build quality of the stand is terrible.But wait, there is more...  I use the Comcast DVR and noticed something bizarre.  When watching live TV it is fine.  When I play back content on the DVR, the TV will start the screensaver every 5-10 minutes even with it disabled in the menu.  I exhausted the menu looking for something that would explain this.  I exhausted searching on the internet for a solution as well.So with all those things, I don't want to work this out with Samsung.  Total waste of time.Update: I had a change of heart and contacted Samsung support in the hopes they can help me out so I wouldn't have to send the TV back.  Something odd...  the TV model is not an option on their support site TV model drop down.  Will update review with the outcome.Update 2: I was reminded of this review from dragonphan's reply.  Thank you for the reply so I can give an update.  My experience has gotten far better; I changed my review to 4 our of 5 stars.  Samsung support offered me a new TV stand the replace the current one, which still suffers from the quality problems but is an easy thing to replace.  The remote control was fixed after repairing it with the TV per Samsung Supports recommendation.  The comcast DVR issue randomly went away...  maybe an update went out to fix the issue?So in the end it is fine. I still am bummed I had that initial experience but it is great knowing that Samsung Support cares and helped me clear up the issues.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "video calibration settings", "Author": "G.

This model of Samsung they seemed to have sorted the normal lack luster speakers.It does make the TV a bit thicker than another one we have form Samsung (series 8000) but for its purpose for us in our house is absolutely fine as is still a very thin TV.If hooking up the TV to a 5.1 system or a Sonos soundbar or something then I might have considered a series which was a bit thinner, but we knew this would be a standalone item, and hence why these inbuilt speakers are so pleasing for us.I personally like the Samsung Smart interface and how easy it is to set up.One feature we were really surprised by and made it a wow moment for us was \"screen mirroring\" from an Amazon Kindle Fire to the TV.We download shows to our Kindle Fire (of which there are loads of free stuff when you have Prime! - Love Amazon Prime!) and then can play them through our TV as they \"wirelessly detect\" each other. Its kinda like having a built in Chromecast but with more content possibilities and then you get great other features like xRay information during playback of content ( this is a Kindle Fire/Amazon Instant Video feature - but is so cool mirrored on this TV!)This works super will for us as we have this TV at our cabin which has no wireless or cable and so our plan was to hook up a DVD player.

I would agree that it does exactly that and it adds to the set's vibrancy though most will also argue that by having the TV on this setting it could very well take some years off the life of the backlighting mechanism. Oh well I say. Its up to each individual person whether they want arguably the best visual experience during the life of the set which again is arguably the \"Dynamic\" setting or whether they want to play it safe so as to try and extend the life of the TV on a lower quality setting such as Standard, Natural or Movie.Anyway if memory serves correctly this TV has a ton of HD ports...well ok 4 to be precise but I'd say thats plenty for hooking up game consoles, Blu Ray players or whatever else you might desire.The sound quality is excellent out of the box but if you're an extreme audiophile you may disagree and desire to go either the sound bar option or the full Home Theater route ala Dolby Digital 5.0 setup and satellite speakers + receiver.The TV is thin, light, aesthetically beautiful and easy to set up.Not much more one could want in a 40 inch HDTV I'd say.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love Our TV!", "Author": "Shay", "ReviewID": "R1ZICA1RW68CIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In our transition from cable TV to online, we have learned a lot.

This TV was an upgrade for my 42 inch Samsung plasma I purchased about 8 years ago. There isn't a thing wrong with it, I just wanted newer technology. This Samsung UN55H6400 is amazing, from the ease of set up to the quality quad processor picture. I am in my 60's and was able to setup the TV, including connecting to the internet without assistance.  I assembled the stand, set it upright, plugged in 4 cables: power, 2 HDMI and digital audio, and turned it on. Seven quick on-screen steps to set up and you are ready to go. The picture is just gorgeous after I did my usual adjustments; turned the backlight, contrast and brightness down, set the picture mode to natural. It was gorgeous before I played with it but I prefer a not quite so bright picture. One thing I will say for those switching from a plasma picture to an LED/LCD picture...you will notice a huge difference in picture quality. To me, the plasma picture is much more vibrant, more intense. That being said, with the new quad processor, the LED picture quality is starting to equal that of the plasma. Just remember one thing: picture quality depends on the type of connector you are using!  Use the best: HDMI! HDMI cables can decipher all 3 screen resolutions: 480, 720 and 1080 and are the easiest to connect. The active 3D is pretty cool. I don't have a 3D bluray player yet but \"explored\" the 3D through the Explore 3D app on the TV. Pretty impressive! I will say the 3D glasses appear to be battery hogs! It appears as though it will require 1 CR1620 battery per pair of glasses per movie. It might be cheaper to invest in the rechargeable version. I have Amazon Prime, Amazon delivered the TV to my house 5 days after purchase, in one piece and well within the scheduled time frame. The delivery boys were super helpful and would have hauled off the box and packing materials had I let them. I have noticed that LCD/LED TV's seem to be short lived, at least in other brands, lots of backlight and power issues. I hope Samsung proves that to be wrong.

It is easily viewable once the \"dynamic\" picture mode is selected, and the internal speakers are better than I expected, although I paired it with a Samsung sound bar, which is a definite must for a TV of this size and quality.  The Samesung sound share system is terrific, with no wires being needed between the sound bar and TV.  THe sub-woofer does a great job (also wireless).  The TV remote and interface is intuitive, and you no longer need to toggle from letter to letter to input words.  Simply point the remote at the screen and move it to  the letter you want and select it.Hooking to the internet using our wireless was also very easy, and there are lots of streaming choices with Smart TV that promises to give cable a run for its money some day....but not quite yet.  Nonetheless, it's a nice feature to have.  I haven't tried 3D, or any of the more sophisticated features, and likely won't given this installation.  I have several other Samsung TV's including one 2013 model, and I would definitely recommend getting the 2014 model.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best 55\" for the money!", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R3KS0OLBY3BHWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV.

I purchased model LN52A850S1FXZA. This was the TV I thought I could retire with and sit in my rocking chair watching.  The reviews said it was the best of the best.  It was one of their top-of-the line TV's and the sticker price was a hefty $3,500 but my last TV lasted almost 18 years so I bought it thinking it would be my last.  A year and a half later the panel went out. Then I discovered that this model had a history of panel problems. When I contacted Samsung, I was told that the warrantee had run out and there was nothing they could or would do.  Don't get me wrong, they were very nice about it - In fact I believe they have many ways to tell you to take a walk without doing anything to help.  It is my perception that a reputable company should stand behind its products (especially their best ones), go the extra mile, be RESPONSIBLE. Hoping that they would share some responsibility for their expensive broken TV, I asked if I could possibly get  a coupon or percentage off the purchase of my next Samsung TV. This was their reply:  \"We received your message at the Office of the President of Samsung Electronics.  As stated previously, we are sorry to hear that you\u2019re experiencing an issue with your Samsung television.  We certainly care about our customers and want to make them happy as often as we can by providing accommodations as much as we can, where we can.  Regrettably, we would not be able to grant your request due to the fact that Samsung does not have a voucher program where we could provide you with a discount on a future Samsung purchase.  I understand this is upsetting and I am sorry we cannot meet your request\".  That was another one of their polite ways of saying - take a walk.  Samsung can't even afford a coupon to take the hurt out of a bad TV.  I don't believe Samsung gives a **** about its customers or anything but making the sale.  A product is only as good as the company that stands behind it - and you can see how that worked out.
