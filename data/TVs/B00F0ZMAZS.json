A sales rep said to be careful running it for more than 5 hours continuously or else it can shorten the life of the backlighting bulb system. I appreciated the honesty. (I'm just relaying what the sales rep said so if there is better information feel free to offer it).  We were not too concerned about this as we rarely watch even 2-3 hours at a time and most days don't even turn on the TV.  This is a 60 hz refresh rate model, so I watched the display model closely in the store and did not see any significant motion blur. It is more of a concern for larger screens >40\" with 1080p. We use it on antenna and it pulls in HD signals (via the RCA ANT 751 antenna) perfectly.  The 1080p and 720p channels look great but of course the 480p channels that are broadcast have black borders on the sides..  Really the only complaint would be that the \"Wide\" button and corresponding picture size settings appear to change the settings universally for all channels. So you wind up hitting this button very regularly if you have differently formatted channels. For cable I expect this wouldn't be an issue. Would have been great to have custom picture size for each channel.  BTW, the HDMI (port1 checked so far) worked great with the laptop, and the optical audio output worked great when sent to the stereo receiver. The 10W speakers in the TV are pretty \"bass-less\" but that's what the stereo is for.  At only $299 at Costco, we are definitely keeping this TV!", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price.", "Author": "Michael Szekely", "ReviewID": "R3LOI4H4ZQLF20", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just wanted to say, it was a steal at $259 from Costco. I like the fact that it is super light weight (about 13 lbs). It was by far, the lightest TV Costco had! And the picture quality is superb even if it only 720p. LED is the way of the future for televisions and JVC made a home run with this one.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Xmas gift", "Author": "Robin Gillette", "ReviewID": "R1RQ0C4R3HW9XN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All looks great, but it is a Christmas gift, so I really can't say at this point.
