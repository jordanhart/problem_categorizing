I paused the game and messed with the tv a min to try to get it back and the weird thing was that the picture scrolled and then disappeared to straight black. if i pushed down on the top and pulled forward it would come back and as soon as i would let go it would do the same thing. I got online and found their website, called and they have a one year \"no nonsense\" gaurentee so I thought I was saved.....I dropped my tv off with them at the place in Canton Mi that they ship through because it would be faster then shipping it.....that was a month ago and they keep telling me to call back by fri and they might have a tracking number for me. MIGHT!!! WTH? they say they are just waiting on UPS to pick it up and the that tv is just sitting in shipping. which means that my tv has been sitting and waiting to be shipped for at the very least 3 weeks, and I've been calling their number for a month now. NEVER AGAIN!!!! it's worth the little bit of extra cash to spend on a name brand. That way you don't end up tv-less for a month with the customer service guys telling you to call back by Friday. next time i'm buying sony!", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV turns off unexpectedly on it's own", "Author": "Regina", "ReviewID": "RXESWI6MDBFL8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this model TV from Sears in April 2013. It is now November 2013 and my TV has started to turn off unexpectedly. When I hit the power button it comes right back on without any issue. However, in another 20 or 30 minutes it'll turn off again unexpectedly and on it's own. TVs last for decades so I definitely shouldn't be having a problem after only seven months. I emailed Seiki today and I'm waiting for response.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "40-inch Diagonal Screen\n1920 x 1080 panel resolution\n176 degree (H) x 176 degree (V) viewing angle\n270-330 cd/m2 Brightness", "Name": "SC402GS 40\" 1080p LCD TV - 16:9 - HDTV 1080p - 120 Hz", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31AdxmjBBRL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B9RKRCO"}}
