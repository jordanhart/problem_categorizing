If you don't plan on using this primarily for DVDs or HD, then you won't be as impressed with the picture.  It really does depend on the source and the connections you use.  My neighbor sells home theater equipment for a living, he recommended this TV for it's picture, and so far I agree with him.  The delivery from amazon was quick(about a week), the delivery company was very helpful and curtious. So far an all around excellent experience.My neighbor had a better deal on this TV but with the Shipping and Tax it would have cost more.", "Date": "July 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good as it gets!", "Author": "Dennis E. Marshall", "ReviewID": "R36UJAGTZ00XE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Toshiba projection TV was the best that I found. Nice picture and great sound. The TouchFocus set the conversion just right. It has plenty of inputs of different types. I was a little surprised that it had no digital audio inputs however. I would have expected to find an optical audio or coaxial audio input. However since I was running my audio though a surround sound system as well as the TV, it was no big deal. There is HDMI input instead of the more standard DVI interface. You have to buy a $129 converter cable to use it. The DVI cable is close to the same price.The menu driven interface is easy to use and setup was a breeze. I got it the same day I received the new Star Wars box set from Amazon. I really love it. The main thing that I was a little disappointed with was the thick scan lines. They're really noticeable on a dark screen. Not too bad but it may take a while to get use to it.", "Date": "October 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Toshiba all the way", "Author": "Electronics Guru", "ReviewID": "R1HFUSP7VZNP96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to take the plundge into HDTV world and found myself knee deep with many different choices. After weeks and many long hours of research, I came across the Toshiba 57H84. And let me tell you it was hands down the best value for the money, which blew away the competion with stunning picture clarity and connectivity option's. In other words simply Amazing!!!!", "Date": "August 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Delivery and Defect Problems Resolved", "Author": "Gail", "ReviewID": "R2Q03WXMDQXKQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this product on Febr. 24th and it was delivered to my home on March 2nd.  The TV was unpackaged in the truck and carried just into the door of my home.  It was not turned on and inspected as promised in the Amazon shipping information.  My son signed for the delivery as I was out of town.  Upon my return, I noticed there had been delivery damage.  The fabric on the bottom of the speaker grill was scaped and torn when the TV had been dragged over the sliding-door jam.  Also, the TV had a manufacturer defect with a fixed black spot on the screen.When I contacted Amazon (via email), they initially said too bad--the TV had been signed for.  I contacted the delivery company and they said they would be responsible for the damage even if Amazon does not cooperate with the claim.  Through either my followup email with Amazon or the persistency of the delivery company, I was shipped a new TV so the problem was resolved with a little persistency. By the way, if you want to talk to Amazon, the phone number is 800-201-7575.I also asked Amazon to not penalize my early purchase by honoring the $100 gift certificate promotion that started Febr 28th.  Afterall, most companies have a 30 day low price guarantee.  Again, I was told \"too bad\" by Amazon. Amazon does have a 30 day low price guarantee, but promotions are considered outside of the guarantee.I contacted Toshiba about the defect and I was given the name of a local authorized service center.  The TV was promptly repaired by removing a small speck of plastic from the lens, problably dislodged when a cabinet screw was installed.  The service person said that he rarely works on Toshiba TV's as they are very reliable.Apart from the delivery damage, the product is excellent, despite the old technology. Adequate space and a wide viewing angle are not issues with my location of this TV, so I went with the proven technology, longer expected product life and much lower price tag. I still have an analog cable signal, so a high definition TV accentuates flaws in the signal.  Like all rear projection TV's, the blacks are not as intense and the picture suffers when viewed at wide angles.  I will not be able to fully appreciate this product until I have a HD signal. But, cartoons, video games, and DVD's are really cool.Prior to purchasing this TV, I tried to read a lot about the various technologies and I found the Crutchfield website to be one of the most informative about HDTV.  Crutchfield does not sell this old technology. I also looked at other various on-line dealers.  Beware of both delivery AND shipping charges.  Frequently, prices are quoted without including both charges so the ultimate price is not disclosed until very late in the purchasing process.I was hesitant about making such a large purchase through a mail order vendor because Amazon does not have the best reputation when it comes to problem resolution.  However, I did have a good outcome with a little persistency.", "Date": "March 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1G9497CIZHW4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv has the best picture of any we looked at.

Now, 4 short years later, the tv is green and turns off on its own.  We had 2 previouse Toshiba's that lasted 16 and 17 years and were a quarter of the price.

Seeing as it is a 2004 model, the salesman gave me a GREAT deal.  About $600 less than I've seen it online.  For the money, it can't be beat.  The picture quality is very good, especially with Discovery HD Theater and my Xbox 360.  Setup was easy, plenty of inputs for all my electronics.  Really, the only complaint I have is that the remote with the TV doesn't work with my DirecTV HD Receiver, and the DirecTV remote doesn't have codes for the TV.  Go figure.  But if that's all I have to complain about, then I'm pretty pleased.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "J.

The 2nd TV is the one I still watching... until 2 weeks ago, it shut down itself after 2.5 hours watched; then just keep shutting down often.So, I noticed there was so much dust, bought an Air canned spray it from the back of penal, the canned didn't work much... I suspect it was over-heat, so I put a fan behind it and it worked but the fan caused too much noise.Finally, I bought an Air Compassor, this time it did a very nice and powerful job to get all the dust away inside the TV electronic boards. Guess what, it fixed the problem, it's working like the way it should be for many hours on without shutting down.

The price was a very competive one, the shipping quote was reasonable. I do however have a problem with the (11)days its gonna take to get to my address. I ordered the item on the 3rd of September, and according to the delivery company affiliated with Amazon(Eagle Delivery) its not gonna arrive until the 14th. Other than that I believe my purchase with Amazon was a quality one. I am however quite excited about experiencing High Definition TV on my new Toshiba 57h84(Whenever it gets here). I am so upset with the shipping company that I will not order any more big screen tv's from amazon. The shipping company blames amazon for inadequate information on the track shipment page, saying their estimates are wrong. I dont, wont, and will not seek to use Eagle shipping Company any more, because I dont understand how a shipment coming from Harrisburg, PA, can get to NC, and end up in Charlotte, completely bypassing the destination address in Greensboro. I am so disappointed to the point of being sick.
