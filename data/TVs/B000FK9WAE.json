{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "James Van Fossentrustee \"jr1748\"", "ReviewID": "R1FA9FWGTSC3VF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After searching for the past year, I deceided to go with a Sharp 45\" LCD. Then I saw C/C had dropped the Hitachi 55\" to $3149.00, much lower than I could get even online. Went to look and was blown away by the pic. It was a no brainer, the Sharp for $3,000.00 (Costco) was good, but couldn't pass up the Hitachi for less. Only gripe was no stand. While Hitachi may not sell the stand with the TV, retailers should keep one or two in stock. Found one at a local Hi Def TV store for $399.00. High price, but wife didn't like the idea of a wall mount.  Now to the TV. Great Hi-def pic. Standard cable fair to good when streached to fit screen. I usually don't run any 4:3 programming to avoid burn in. Sound from built in speakers better than I expected, but also have a 500w kenwood surround sound systen for backup. I like that you can plug a sub-woofer into the TV, but had to turn mine down as bass was overboosted. Standard DVD and VCR very good using high quality cables, but plan to upgrade the DVD in near future. The remote is actually very easy to use for TV, but lacks functions when controlling my digital cable box or stereo. I decided to use the cable remote instead. If using over the air or basic cable, TV remote works fine. Right now, all cable boxes and accessories are hooked up with monster cable, but have an HDMI cable on order, cheaped on-line than in store. I expect even better pic quality with this setup. The only bad experience with this purchase was a pushy salesman, who was pushing any TV but the Hitachi, and an expensive warranty.  I would recommend any who like large plasma units to take a look at this, or the other 55\" Hitachi units. A great TV, that even my wife likes.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best 55 inch Plasma Ever!", "Author": "brent975link \"brent9752000\"", "ReviewID": "R33K2XLH9A1DP7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a year of research and several visits to BB and CC, I have come to the conclusion that Panasonic 50 inch plasma is the best there is-- until I saw this Hitachi 55 inch. Being the brand-conscious buyer, I wanted my first plasma to be a Panasonic, a Samsung or a Pioneer. But I couldn't get my eyes off this TV. Side by side with the Panasonic 50 inch, the Hitachi looked bigger, sharper and richer in color vibrance. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but my brother had the same observation. What sealed the deal was the price; for 3 grand, this TV was a steal (the Panasonic was $600 less but then again, it was also 5 inches smaller); the stand or wall mount is sold separately (I got the stand for $150). This TV is a dream come true! It has tons of cool features like the anti-reflective glass screen which takes away the glare when watching daytime shows. The picture mode can be automatically programmed to shift from day to night mode with a timer. Another cool feature is the zoom; I could remove the black bars when watching 16:9 widescreen DVD and HD-DVD formats (which practically prevents premature burn-in). It's a 720p/1080i resolution TV (1080p may be better but all HDTV broadcasts nowadays are still 720p; it may take several years before real 1080p shows arrive-- when that time comes, it's probably time to buy another plasma). I have watched Discovery HD theater and boy, it was eye-popping! Watching football on ESPN-HD feels like being there. My HD-DVDs, especially 'Superman Returns' and 'The Last Samurai' were totally out of this world! I can't believe I have waited this long to buy this plasma TV. For the quality, picture and price, nothing beats Hitachi!", "Date": "December 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great tv for its price", "Author": "Mohammedi Padaria", "ReviewID": "R1PE2IIT6J4MI1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "ProsThe picture quality is unbelieveble. HD quality is second to none. It is probably the sharpest picture I have seen (researched plasma/lcd tvs for over 2 years). It has lots of inputs for all devices and the setup out of the box is pretty easy. Picture in Picture quality is great.TV comes with a WIPE functionality. This allows you to clean the plasma screen and prevent any burns. (Usually available with much more expensive models)ConsRemote is bit antiquated for the price of the tv. Picture in picture works only if one of the feeds is HD. Base needs to be bought (add $200 to the price.)Bottom line - I would recommend buying this tv. Shop around and you should be able to find it for less than $2500.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "research research research", "Author": "Michael J.

It has worked great up until now.  The set will turn on, has sound but no picture.

I was able to get it for $1729 at Tiger Direct and was lucky enough to be just out of state so no tax and I picked it up so no shipping.  I put it on the wall with a Peerless Tilt mount rated to 200lbs and it was the easiest install I had ever done.  The only word of caution: This is a huge set and it takes 2 big guys to lift and install.Now I am into professional video and work closely with video reproduction on computer monitor and other screens so my eye is more critical than most and I have one thing to say. There are purchases that don't live up to your expectations, products that come out about what you expected and the few that far exceed your expectations.  My experience was the latter. For the cost, this set blew me away.  You can't get a better looking image from a set this size for this cost.  I paired it with a Toshiba HD-2A HD DVD player and though the Toshiba is a little clunky, it has awesome image upconversion and features (an obvious early adopter box).  The SD DVDs I have played on it look awesome.  I will let you know how the HD DVDs look once I pick a few up.  I plugged my XBOX 360 in and WOW, there is nothing like it (there were audible gasps from my friends)...even from 3 feet away!This set is being phased out by Hitachi and replaced by a smaller 50\" 1080i 401 series set now which I hear is also very good, but I was quite happy to save a grand and have 5 more inches on my wall.", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Hitachi Ultravision 55\" Plasma", "Author": "Erik Herman", "ReviewID": "R24TFKJTG3URQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my 61\" projection TV.Sleek, beautiful picture.

I bought this as soon as it came out in 7/2006.  I only had one issue and it was when I moved out of state. I plugged it in when I got to my new home and it worked then after the movers left I went to set it up and it would not turn on. I called a tv repair man and at a high expense they would come out to check it out and fix it. They said it most likely was the power cord.  I called Hitachi  instead and turns out the repair person was wrong.  Under the name HITACHI at the bottom of the tv there is a little compartment that opens and you can reset the tv.  I did this and it turned right on.  Make sure you check that before you go and have a service person come to your house as they will not tell you to do this.

Moore", "ReviewID": "R2DFRG2IK93XZD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading a recommendation from Consumer Reports, I shopped this unit around and purchased it off the internet for $2,000 (freight incl.) and am very happy with the quality of the picture- although as with most high-tech electronics; my lack of understanding of all of the ways to connect to your cable box, DVD recorder, surround-sound, etc. made set-up a very confusing and time-consuming ordeal.

Like some of the others have said, I too did a TON of research on this TV along with every other TV in its's class.  Hitachi is a fantastic manufacturer and this is an incredible TV.  Amazon's price of $1,999.99 is completely fair for a machine of this quality and their price is consistent with other retailers fortunate enough to have a couple of these TV's.I watched my first Blu-Ray movie on this TV last night and I was blown away.  Watching sports in High-Def is truly amazing.  I just cant say enough.Also, if you happen to own a PS3, this TV really brings out the quality picture in your games.WORD OF ADVICE:  Don't wait on this too much longer.  These TV's are in limited supply and, as you can imagine, are selling out quickly.

The sales associates at store were advocating for The Sony , Samsung and Pioneer, I wanted to believe they were right but no matter how many times I compared all the models, my eyes tell me what you see, is what you get,the sound quality is good too I was convinced that the Hitachi 69 was soo much better than the rest. Do yourself a favor , check this one out before buying.At first I wanted the better known brands like Sony and Samsung, but those products just did not seem to compare.

It has been over a month and they told me today to give them 10 more days.  We  are very upset.  We paid over $3,000 for this TV.  Is This the best they can do.

The resolution underway at a local repair shop is to replace the upper & lower buffers. The TV is 2 yrs and nine months old.

The parts are ~$225, The labor is ~$225. Hitachi would have sent the parts for free had I been within the 2-year window (1 yr regular warranty + 1 yr grace period). It was absolutely silly of me to think HITACHI would do the right thing and send me parts at 2 yrs and 9 months (sarcasm). I can tell you one thing......There is NFW I will ever buy a Hitachi product again and that includes anything even affiliated with Hitachi (inc. imbeded electronics). I will steer every person on the planet away from them in the future.

Harrington", "ReviewID": "R34DCNKMKPKAS3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my second Plasma but first HD televison.  I bought this item from a local retailer in Dallas because it seemed to have the best picture for the size and price.  I also tried to find reviews online before I made the purchase and was only able to find the customer reviews here on Amazon.  It was delivered today and I spent most of the day trying to adjust the picture quality. The great picture I saw in the store was impossible to duplicate at home.I do not have an HD signal to feed into it yet as I was waiting to upgrade my DishNetwork DVR until after the TV was delivered.  However, the standard def picture is awful.  Whatever settings I tried, the picture was dull and hazy.  Everything about the picture was lifeless compared to my old 42\" EDTV Samsung... except for the color green.  The green will burn your retinas!  Grass and trees looked like they were painted neon green. Adjusting the hue to a more red shade failed to counteract the over-powering green and only caused skin colors to look horrribly sunburned.I also failed to get a sharp picture.  I wouldn't say that the picture was blurry. But adjusting the contrast and brightness settings either returned a picture that looked like it had a transparent white film over everything or a picture that was to shadowy and overly black.  Finding a happy-medium was impossible.The original factory setting are completely unsatisfactory.  Someone in the Hitachi labs is colorblind and has cataracts.  I'm returning the TV right after the holiday rush is over and getting a 50\" Panasonic, Samsung, etc. instead.  I will never buy another Hitachi product again as long as I live.
