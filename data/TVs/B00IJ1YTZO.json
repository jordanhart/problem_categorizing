{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lets See What Happens Next", "Author": "Ren", "ReviewID": "R2Q5W6BNJ2LV89", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Review for:Samsung UN40H5500 Slim 40-inch 1080p 60Hz Smart LED TV.Abstract:I bought this TV shortly after it was available on Amazon. The smart features are excellent. However, I had a variety of problems with two TVs before I purchased a third which was flawless. I have been updating my review here to share what has been going on with the TVs and the returns.Pros:Excellent CPU. Previous model had a dual core, this one has a quad core, which means the smart features are faster. The features are excellent. It is true that you can watch Netflix, Amazon videos, browse the internet, and so much more. All smart features work well, except some times that the Youtube app is laggy and prone to crashes (I don't blame the TV on this, but it is more of the app version which is different from one you would see on a smart phone). I do like some features of the Youtube app which allow me to create playlists on my smart phone and watch them on the TV. The Netflix app was recently upgraded and it works even better now, if you like Netflix  or Amazon videos, specially if you have Amazon prime, you need one of these TVs. The network card, the hardware component that allows you to connect to your home's wireless network, is perfect. You can connect to 2g or 5g WLAN. Storage on the TV is good, but really you should use an external Hard Drive for home movies and pictures you wish to stream or if you can connect it to your home PC and stream from there. This TV is essentially a computer, so you can always plug in a mouse and keyboard and browse the net. The Smart TV features are excellent, I recommend it.Cons:I had to buy three TVs before I received one that was working as intended.The first one that I bought was returned for it had two clusters of yellow and blue lights stuck on the screen. No matter what I was watching those lights would show up. I quickly contacted Amazon and returned it. Amazon's return policy is, as always, excellent. I received a second TV, but this one had a dead pixel; therefore I returned it as well. It felt more like a hassle than anything, but again you can trust Amazon to take care of any problems like this; you won't even have to pay the return shipping.Extra information:Since I was asked below in the comments. This model does not come with a smart remote or voice control; you would need to get the 6400+ model if you want those features. You could buy the smart remote and use it perfectly well on this TV, but voice recognition won't work.I am upgrading my review from 3 stars to 4. I recommend this TV, the fact that I received two defective ones does not mean all are defective. For the price and features you will receive, you are getting one of the best TVs on the market. If you want something worthy of a 5 star review you need to look at the 6350 or 6400 Samsung models, which I plan to review soon.Sincerely,R.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice but some issues...", "Author": "K. O'Toole \"R teest\"", "ReviewID": "R3GOCFZVOBAF2V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture quality of this TV is more than adequate but the sound was typical of most TVs...weak.  I ordered a sound bar to handle the audio requirements.  As others have reported Samsung tech support is wholly inadequate and the literature supplied was equally pore.  Once I payed my dues ( four hours with a tech from our cable provider on day one and another two hours on day two)  the TV finally \"Smartened up\" and I was able to start enjoying the Smart TV experience.  It's been about three weeks and I'm still discovering new capabilities which by the way you'll have to sort out on your own unless you happen to know someone who's already been through it.  I was actually considering returning the TV at one point but I decided to stick it out and I'm glad I did.  You can pair the tv with other devices ie: smart phones, laptops, cameras, etc and transfer images, videos, music, etc wirelessly .  Connecting to Youtube and Netflix is a snap  once you get past the learning curve.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic television", "Author": "Michael Robinson", "ReviewID": "RMNDV75PP27FT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture on this TV is extremely nice, comparable to my old plasma. Hell, I was playing a Wii game on this thing the other day and thought it looked pretty good, and Wii games usually look like actual garbage from a garbage can on HDTVs.I use this TV as a PC monitor as well, and getting it it to display properly was as easy as changing the input label to \"PC\". It also has one of the most intelligently designed interfaces I've seen on a TV. For instance, I used wireless headphones to avoid waking up room mates, and there is a convenient \"Tools\" button on the remote that makes changing my audio options a breeze.There are plenty of apps available for it, but I have not really used it's smart functions extensively. Other users have had issues in that area, and I cannot attest to whether or not they have been resolved. I did have issues getting the TV online, but that was due to Comcast. Pro-tip for bay area Comcast subscribers: Manually set the DNS address to 75.75.76.76.Also, to hell with Comcast.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV, just requires some tweaking", "Author": "Anon", "ReviewID": "RML17XDGQ1MKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic TV.  The panel that this TV uses (aka the electronic circuit and screen) is currently (as of my review) the 2nd best for this class size (40 inch) out of all TVs.  I challenge anyone to point to a screen that has a better picture in this size (besides the 6350).The whole bezel is extremely sleek and well worth the enhanced look over last years model.The sound as others have described is a little weak and very sensitive depending on the input.  I would say the speakers are about average nothing more nothing less.  Your friends are not going to come over just to hear some tunes on these speakers.The SmartTV features are great but have your computer handy when you set up because many of the apps require you to go to a website and type in a code to activate.  No one mentioned this yet but this TV has 1 GB of space for apps, which is quite a lot considering most apps are only a few MB's.The TV has 3 HDMI ports, one is labeled set up box, another is HDMI (ARC), and another HDMI (DVI).  I had to look up what all these types mean but apparently they are all interchangeable.  It should be noted if you have a HDMI equipped sound bar it should be plugged in the ARC HDMI port.Last but not least, if you decide to purchase this TV I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you turn off the dynamic contrast.  Mind you this is different than regular contrast.  The regular contrast is fine the way it is set to 100.  The regular contrast is not what I am talking about, I said turn the dynamic contrast ratio OFF.  With it on, the colors are extremely oversaturated, and everyone will look sunburned.  You can turn it off going to menu, picture, advanced settings, dynamic contrast.Overall, this is a fantastic TV and I am very satisfied with my purchase.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Tv with minor flaws", "Author": "Cj", "ReviewID": "R1DAGUDQUVVJFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would love to give it 5 stars but let me point out the flaws 1st.I don't know if it's just my TV faulty manufacturing or needs a software upgrade and this may not even be noticable for some people but i play on my ps4/ps3 and it's super noticeable. I guess it's called ecosenser or idk what but it basically reduces backlight in dark scenes so if your in a night scene it just dims.. like really? whats the point of this... It wouldnt be annoying if it was minor but its like -10 backlight ATLEAST. There's also a option to turn it off but it does not work. I tried everything in settings but couldnt fix it. Another issue i have is i have to turn my tv on and wait like 20-30 seconds to change input cause it just delays.. its wierd. but thats it for flaws. Aside for these 2 thing's it's a near perfect TVPros:-Beautiful picture quality when compared to last year F series-Colors are better and menus are way better-This has to be the best sound (loud and clear) for a LED tv, Ive owned plenty TVs-great for gaming-My ps3/ps4 games look better and run smoother on this compared to f series-TV has IR blaster so no need for cable remote anymore it's all in one-Has bunch of apps that i dont use but beneficial for other people (easy to navigate via smarthub button)I can say a few more good things but you get the point.. if you game or considering buying a 2014 TV for your next gen xbox or ps4 then this tv is for you. For movies i wouldn't really recommend since its 60 hz and movies are better on 120hz but for gaming or cable/music this tv is great like 9/10. Also i own both 2013 and 2014 f and h series same model same tv basically and i gotta say there's a big difference in just one year. The sound and menus are instantly noticeable to be better but the picture quality is way better. Overall great tv highly recommended.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good TV UN32H5500", "Author": "Jimbo89 \"Jimbo89\"", "ReviewID": "R1I54XGWBGOGC2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV, this week. I have a Verizon HD box from my Verizon TV provider. I plugged this TV in, set up was pretty much painless.(((If you're using the Verizon HD box, you have to make sure you put the setting on 1080, just go in the settings on the Verizon box, through the \"Menu\" button on the remote and make sure that is on. Because 720p was selected. Not the settings on the TV, the TV will pick up the 1080 automatically, this is just for Verizon users on there Verizon HD box. If you don't have a Verizon Fios HD box for TV, ignore this.)))Anyway, the TV has stunning picture quality, really nice.I don't use the apps too much and might have to comment more when I start to use them, but I used this with Youtube, and to get it to work, you log into Youtube on your computer and you type in the code that the TV gives you, you'll see the directions. After it syncs the 2, when you're on your computer watching youtube vids, there is a little button next to the button on Youtube vids where you can \"Make it Full screen\" to the right it says \"Play on TV\", you just hit that button and Youtube will play right on the Samsung.There is also a Youtube app that works fine also. But sometimes I find it easier to search on the computer and then stream it right to the TV.This TV has the quad core processor, which is suppose to give it a bit more speed loading stuff (apps,etc.). The 2 previous models before it the \"Samsung UN32F5500\" had a dual core processor (2013 model) and before that the Samsung UN32EH5300 (2012 model) had just a single processor.If I use the apps more, I will come back to update.To stream from your computer, you basically download the \"Samsung Link\" software to your computer or smart device, set which folders you want to share and they will play on the TV. When you log into the \"Samsung link\" software on the computer, if you have any problems, just look for the \"Getting started\" button on the software, because the manual doesn't have to much on specifics of a problem. It took me a few tries to get this to stream from my computer to my TV. You just have to make sure you read the \"Getting started ?\" link on the software.I got it to stream an HD movie file from my computer to the TV, it played nice and looked great. Just like any other HD channel.When streaming movies from your computer like (divx movie files, or Mpeg files)you are able to fast forward, here's how. When your movie is streaming look for the settings button, on the Samsung, then hit \"select scene\" then \"Time bar\" then you'll have the option to Fast forward or rewind while streaming video files off your computers hard drive to the Samsung. I didn't realize this.I hooked my portable 320 GB hard drive through the Samsung's USB port, with all of my movies (divx, mpeg) on the drive. The TV recognized the drive in a second and I was able to play my movies right off the Hard Drive. There are 2 USB ports.I would make sure the TV is off though when you pull out these thumb drives and portable hard drives. Because there is still power going to the drive and you don't want to just pull out the drive with power going to it, it can corrupt your data. So I usually just make sure the TV is off before I pull out my USB or Portable hard drive. You don't want to take the chance of corrupting any data. Just an FYI.I don't have a Netflix account, I already have so many channels on my cable, so I can't comment on that. But, I'm sure the quad processor helps with the loading of the apps. I know on the earlier models of this TV (2012) there was some complaints about slow loading times, but it seemed to load OK on this newer 2014 model.I think that's all I have to share for now,So my final thoughts are, I would recommend getting the Samsung 32 inch 1080p UN32H5500 TV.I think it is priced fairly well. The picture quality is great, 2 USB hookups, loads an external drive no problem, streaming from my computer worked fine and looked good. I will probably give an update in the next few months to let you know how it is working.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "I returned it, but I love it!", "Author": "Molly Andrade", "ReviewID": "R1GOXEV6AMG8RS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I returned this TV after having it for one day. It has a fantastic picture with no weaknesses I could find. The bezel around the screen is so thin, It looks like a picture with no frame around it when its on! (This took some getting used to). The TV is as thin as I've seen. The sound is, well, get a sound bar if you want big sound. This one definitely does NOT have voice control, like the page says it does.  But I returned it because I just couldn't get into the smart TV functionality. As fine a user interface as this TV has, and as many amazing features as the Samsung smart suite boasts, I Found myself returning it and buying the Samsung PN43F4500 (plasma) at BB on sale for $379. 40 inches was a little small for my little living room, but a 46 (the next size up in Samsung LEDs) is too big. I will miss the searingly bright whites, the rrrazor sharp images and the fact that it weighs like 2 pounds. I'm not going all the way back to the stone age people. I still have the blu-ray player with a few good aps. I rather enjoy that my plasma is just pretty to look at and dumb as a bag of hammers. To quote a CNET reviewer, \"I want my dumb TV\".

This is my second Samsung Smart TV, the other being the 2013 UN32EH5300 (another 32\" model). This TV is definitely sharper and more responsive.  I've found no reason to be disappointed with it, and would recommend it over the older model.  The one feature that really shines is Smart View, which allows me to mirror what I'm watching on my tablet.Setup was easy, by simply plugging it in it came on and started in setup mode.  As soon as I connected it to my home network, it searched for and found a firmware update and installed it. The TV supports wired as well as 2.4GHz and 5GHz WIFI.  Adding the cable channels came next and went without a hitch as well.  Finally I added my Amazon Prime, again with no issues.  The only downside was that this model does not support the TCW Cable Viewer, allowing me to watch all of my HD digital subscription channels without a cable box (my UN32EH5300 does support the app).The picture is bright and clean, the blacks are black, and darker colors/areas in the image are not muggy. The sound is fine for me, but I'm no audiophile like some of the other reviewers seem to be.  After watching a couple of hours of cable, I streamed an episode of a show via Amazon prime and followed up by streaming a video off of my NAS (with built in Media Server), I didn't have any (TV related) issues with either streaming source. My network was stable the whole time, so I didn't experience any brief drops that required the TV to recover the video stream.Overall, I'm very pleased with this TV.  My only issues are with the lack of the TWC Cable Viewer App support (mildly aggravated); and stylistic differences between the remote and the Smart TV interface on this TV and my older UN32EH5300.  These issues are minor, and not worth pulling a star for.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Completely Exceeded My Expectations", "Author": "K.

It's not noticeable unless you're picky and in a dark room with a dark scene on TV.The other issue is more serious. Netflix seemed unreliable - it would just stop playing and say try again later, with many different movies. Sometimes it just looked like it crashed.

If I use the ssr to control the cable box it forgets the settings for the sound system.  Then a while later it forgets both.  So I have had no luck using thessr as a universal remote altho it controls the tv fine, with the exception below5-attempting to surfthe internet my attempts to enter passwords using the onscreen keyboard and the arrow buttons of the ssr has been a total failure - the tv interface will not accept the passwords entered in that manner.  We do have wireless remote keypad and keybd butthey are for apple - and I havenot gotten around to attempting to use them to surf the internet and enter pws yet as I was fed up with trying to use the screen keybd.6-If you want to surf the internet - same yourself time and aggravation - use your ipad or your laptop - the UI for surfing the internet with the ssr and the tv screen just seems too clunky and slow to get around as I am accustomed.7-At least one app saves me money - I do not pay for an HBO FIOS ssubscription but Ifound the HBO app that comes with the tv apps is free to access a lot of past series, documentaries, and movies thru the HBO app. The app is a little slow to get thrubecause it presents the iconsfor the varies tv show, movies etc in no specific order and does not offer category groupings so finding something you may like can eat up a lotmore time than I care to spend - cannot understand why thereare no category groupings to the app.  Also if you want to bookmark a movie half way thru there isno way to do this that I found the first and only time I tried.  Maybe its there but it was not intuitive.

I was actually offended the minute I took it out of the box. yes, offended at the overall cheapness in quality. I tried though, gave it a fair chance, set it up, tried to get used to it. No, after a few days I boxed it back up for return.#1- too small. don't know how they came up with 48\", it soo much smaller screen area than the 50\" it replaced.#2- the stand. two tiny little black screws hold the screen up. theres two more holes molded in, but theyre not drilled or threaded, although they included screws for them. ?. the result is VERRRY flimsy Tv. a childs fingertip touch will set it rocking uncontrollably. really needs those other two holes drilled and threaded. people in earthquake prone areas will be very unsatisfied. and its offensive as to the quality to find something molded in to design, then left undrilled/threaded like they changed their mind after design, or they just got cheap. camon Samsung, drill an thread two more holes you had planned, molded and included the screws for. it really needs it. I would be worried about its sturdiness all the time.mount it to the wall and it gets even smaller-looking. #3- smart Tv. yep, has it. I wouldn't let these guys into my network. wont use it. Because then for internet Tv you have to go thru their hub. slows you down, they collect your data, and pound you with advertising. youll see, you have to sign about 10 different permissions to get the smart Tv app working.#4- Sound: tinny, whataya expect?, your so obsessed to have the thinnest device on earth. how can tiny speakers with no depth have any kind of decent sound quality?.add 299 for adequate sound thru a sound bar, or hook up to your stereo, and then use a separate remote for sound.I can solve both the sound and flimsy stand by suggesting they do what my older Sony has. A sound bar along the whole bottom of unit. lets face it, you have at least 9-12 inches for the stand, tables are at least 16-20 inches deep, use that depth for decent built-in speakers and a stable stand for the Tv. But noone uses the stand you say. cool, hang it on the wall, and you STILL NEED a table underneath it for DVD ,bluray, etc.., and then wires are going up the wall/over/around everywhere in view to the Tv. wow, that looks ..eerrr, great!.But everyone wants a paper-thin Tv. ???. thats the #1 criteria you give them. like your phone. like your tablet. so theyre just giving you what you want. suffer the tinny cheap sound or pay gads more for a sound bar. they'll be happy to take more of your money for decent sound.but hey, youre the coolest on the block!. look how thin your Tv is!.My Tv location has a big front window 90 degrees to it, and this Tv did no better in a sunny room then the old Sony. Its washed out. LED is so bright it actually makes it worse. and then theres the reflectiveness of the screen. its a mirror. even when its on, I can I see myself and things in the the room wherever the picture is darker on the screen. a shiny black mirror. distracting. disturbing. at night or dark room its worse, more reflection. enjoy movie-night.But lets say Im some old picky, particular, fussy cheap jerk. ok. lets run it by my guy friends. guys shake stuff, tap it, pick it up, look behind it, underneath it...etc. you know, were all quality assurance & engineering experts. or think we are.well they quickly discovered the same issues, and mocked the flimsiness and therefore overall cheap-ness of all Samsung products, sparking a discussion of how they all have bigger better sturdier mo' better Tv's. of course. one has an older (last years) Samsung. he was quiet, kind-a shrugged his shoulders, an said: well, it IS thin.I didn't tell them it only has two tiny screws holding it up. I was worried it was gonna break off the stand.so NO. it didn't pass average good 'ol boy inspection.I don't know what Im going to do. I tried, I dont know what I can possibly buy for a new Tv now. I'll keep my old  50\" sony and keep putting bulbs in it every couple of years. great picture. great sound. has all the connections this Tv does. I stream thru laptop wirelessly w/HDMI, an control it with wireless KB/Mouse from my chair. never buffers or pauses.it was 1500 dollars 7 years ago.I thought 48\" would be comparable screen size with much thinner bezels nowadays. Its not.this might be fine for a small bdrm. with a soundbar. wall mounted. +$$A New Tv has to make you say wow!, this blows away my old Tv, - not this doesn't beat my old Tv,and seems like its much cheaper quality.Ill have to get at least a 60 inch and pay the price-at least 1500-2000 for a comparable new Tv.I'll stick with Sony, an look for a sale. I tried these cheap brands, and Im too disappointed. I shoulda known.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Be aware of the Samsung TV, especially this model", "Author": "J. Tan", "ReviewID": "R3RF68VD1TDNW0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I need to admit that I disregard the bad reviews before I buy this TV. I saw the un32F5500 has a good review of 4.5 stars and this is an upgraded version of it. So I assumed it will be the same. Besides this is one of the most expensive 32\" TV in the market.After I get the TV I know I am wrong. First of all, the most dissatisfying me is the white blotch at two bottom corners. It is about 1.5 x1.5 inches, seem like cloud/flog on top of the background black color. If you move your body and view from some certain degree, it will become lighter. But if you are sitting in front of the TV and not too far (like 5-10 feet), it is noticeable. I have searched online and quite a lot people reporting this problem on LED TVs. But as a top brand with high price, it should be better. I didn't own other Samsung TV. But I have a 55\" Panasonic LED. There is no problem at all. Even after I found this white blotch issue and go back to see if my Panasonic has the same issue, I still cannot find anything wrong while I check it in a dark environment.Second I want to complaint is the thickness of the TV. It is extremely thick for a LED TV and all those pictures posted in the ads are misleading. When you get the TV you should know what I am talking about. I can understand Samsung doesn't have good technology to build the TV thin enough but I don't like the way they cheating. All the Korean eletronics products such as TV, cars, cell phones and Etc, are copied the design from others. Of course they will not 100% copy. They will copy to a certain degree so other manufacturers cannot suit them. So it is not hard to understand why the Japnese ones can be thinner. Samsung need to make a different layout inside the panel to avoid a lawsuit. Therefore it increases the thickness.Third, this TV is made in Mexico. I don't realize at the beginning. When I see some very light scratch on the plastic base, I was kind of weird because you will never see this kind of issues in most Japanese appliances. This only happen on some made in China or India stuff. So I turn the box around and find out it is made in Mexico. After I do some research online, I find most Samsung TVs are made in Mexico. His competitors, such as Panasonic, is made is USA.There is a lot of other issues such as the sensitivity of the remote control but it is not big and can be ignored. I really want to give advice to those who are interested in this TV. Check it out in a store before you buy it!
