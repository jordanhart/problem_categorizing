{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sharp, Clear and Bright!", "Author": "Ice", "ReviewID": "R1PC6PUOBEZGV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung UN46ES6580 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz 3D Slim LED HDTV has a phenomenal picture.The picture is bright, clear and sharp.  I love this picture!  You might find yourself looking at the picture and seeing details in TV programs and DVD's that you have never seen before.  The scrolling banners on news programs for instance come in clear and crisp.  I have not noticed any motion blurring at all.I use OTA(Over the Air) to receive TV signals.  This utilizes just a plain old TV antenna.  HD signals are fantastic.  SD signals are just OK.  The tuner in the TV worked great at picking up stations from my state and my neighboring state. I get lots of stations easily.  Plain to upgrade to Comcast TV next week, so I will see what the picture looks like then.I find the controls and menu system to be relatively intuitive.  Easy to navigate and you find what you are looking for easily.  The remote could be better, but it is not too bad.  It would have been nice to have a remote with a small keyboardand mouse pad.  Its entirely usable, but not the best for surfing the internet and inputting text for search engines or apps like YouTube, Netflix, and others.There is a better solution.  Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad (920-003070) Comes with a USB connector that plugs into back of TV.  Great for surfing internet and general navigation through TV menu controls.To set up keyboard, go to MENU, then SYSTEM, over to DEVICE MANAGER, then to KEYBOARD SETTINGS.  That's it...It might recognize keyboard automatically after you plug in USB receiver, and you might not have to do those steps however.The TV does come with 4 active 3D glasses.  Have not used 3D yet.Also, comes with Skype camera. Have not used this either yet.I find that the video setting of Dynamic is best for me.  Also, my wife and I like the sound setting on Movie.  There are plenty of settings to adjust picture and sound.Internet works fast and apps seem pretty nice.  You can have TV PIP(picture in Picture) when surfing the internet. Nice!Overall, so far, I have not had any problems.  If you register your TV on Samsung site, you will get an extra 3 months on your warranty.After thought.  I spent over 2 years casually researching TV's.  This one has everything that I wanted and hoped for.  Went to Sam's Club before buying this one and brought home a 50\" LG Plasma for half the price of the Samsung.  Of course it was not a Smart TV though.  It had 3 bright defective pixels.  The LG went right back to Sam's Club the same day.  The display model at Sam's had 2 defective pixels.  This is just plain inexcusable.That is when I decided to \"bite the bullet\" and ordered the more expensive Samsung.  I do not regret my decision.Also, when I ordered from Amazon, the price was $100 more than what it is now.  As the TV was being shipped, Amazon promptly refunded the difference.  Good going Amazon.However, I was not happy with the way Amazon shipped the TV.  It was by regular UPS delivery.  The box had one visible break in it. I expected and wrongly assumed, better packaging.  The shipping box was the original box the TV comes in.  Should have been doubled boxed with better padding.Other than that, I would recommend this TV if it is within your budget. It really is fantastic...if it lasts.RobertUpdate:  Skype camera works well on initial testing.  Video and sound quality is good.  Skype app has option to automatically login when TV starts, but it seems like it only automatically  logins when you actually enter Smart Hub, and not when TV actually starts.  Possible Skype app problem.  Also, had one occasion when after using some app, that the TV only displayed a pinkishhue.  Reset TV by unplugging, and then plugging back in.  Have not had any other problems since.  Also, there is a firmware update for TV on Samsung website.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture, when it isn't cloudy", "Author": "early adopter in ATL", "ReviewID": "R1BY25LR184OJ6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "** Update: downgraded from 4 stars to 3. The cloudiness is still annoying me; I wish I'd just bought another plasma **This TV has a fantastic picture, until you get to a dark scene. There are visible \"clouds\" at the edge of my screen when watching letterboxed movies, and when viewing menus on gaming consoles. It almost looks like you're at a drive-in movie with someone shining their headlights on the screen. It's not terrible, but it's enough to be annoying. I should have done more research before buying this TV. Some forum discussions indicate that the 6580 has microdimming, but it doesn't. You'll need to step up to the UN46ES7100 for this.Pros+ WiFi works well for streaming HD (1080p60)+ Samsung store has all the apps I need (Hulu, Vudu, Pandora, Netflix)+ Screen is nice and bright, great for daytime viewing+ Movie and Standard modes have good defaults (Standard needed some tweaking)+ HDMI CEC works great - I can control my Sony BluRay player with it!+ 2D-3D conversion works well, and the remote has a dedicated button for this+ Glasses are comfortable; 3D looks much better than at the theater.+ Uses less energy than a 60-watt bulb+ SD looks \"good enough\" (but HD looks superb)Cons- LED light leakage is visible in dark scenes, and in letterboxed movies. Great uniformity otherwise.- IR remote backlight is much too dim, and requires pressing the button twice to turn on (why??)- Frame interpolation is enabled by default, and is difficult to find in the menu to turn off. Classic movies looked like soap operas until I figured out how to disable this.- Natural Mode is not natural, and Dynamic mode is unusable for me.- Adjusting Picture settings takes several remote clicks; IR remote should have a dedicated button for this- 1 hot pixel in my sample; not visible from my viewing position", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best TV Ever", "Author": "L.

We have a 44\" Samsung in our 5th wheel camper and really enjoyed the picture clarity, so that's what influenced our decision on this Samsung.

If you order from Amazon, they ship it free, no sales tax and the shipping company un-crates it and sets it up for you at no charge.  Of course I gave the guys a $20. as a tip though.

Samsung clearly was the best of the best when it came to color brilliance and features.My son and I setup the HDTV in just over an hour.  It was very straight forward and easy for two people.  Attaching the included stand would have been a challenge for only 1 person.Our previous Samsung had multiple component inputs so we needed to run to the store for HDMI cables for the Comcast DVR and DVD player.Unlike previous Samsung models, this model comes with Wi-Fi enabled (without having to purchase an extra attachment).  The Wi-Fi signal was strong so there was little delay in accessing websites.  If you plan to do a lot of Internet surfing, consider purchasing the Samsung wireless mouse and keyboard.The Samsung apps are okay - perhaps we are slightly spoiled after using iPad and Android apps for so long.  The Skype app works well with the included Samsung webcam with built-in microphone.Overall I would strongly recommend this HDTV for anyone.  The 55\" works well in a 20' x 40' living room.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great mid-range LED 3D HDTV", "Author": "MAX SMART", "ReviewID": "R1Z2YR5BIFEA0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a review of a used version of this model that I paid $627.00 for last week on amazon warehouse deals.  I took a risk and purchased this 'used' instead of new to save over $500.00.  What a deal, TV arrived in almost new condition, no damage or issues at all, just repackaged.The TV came with 4 pairs of 3D Glasses, web camera, and all other accessores.  Everything was in just about new condition, never opened.  I noticed some minor back light clouding on the TV, but I was able to remove it with calibration in the settings.  Once i adjusted the settings, the TV shows inky blacks, no clouding and very white whites and brilliant color on the screen.  It did take a while to calibrate the settings, but very much worth the trouble. 3D looked very good on this TV, and getting the 4 pairs of new 3D Glasses for free was just an added benefit.Once calibrated this TV's black levels are almost darker and inky as my previous Panasonic GT30 Plasma, I sent that back to amazon due to image retention issues and heat issues, the screen heat almost heated my whole condo when turned on.  The LED has no heat from the screen, and uses 3/4 less power.Pros:- Outstanding Picture quality (after calibration and settings adjustments)- Great inky blacks and clear whites (after calibration and settings adjustments)- I have owned 2 previous LED TV's and returned both of them due to led lighting and clouding issues, this TV allows for that to be calibrated out, and shows significant improvements with inky blacks and whitest whites once you calibrate it.- Paid $627.00, saved $500.00 by buying a used warehouse deals model- 4 pairs of new 3D Glasses included, and web camera included- thin, light and uses very little power (no heat from the screen like my previous panasonic plasma)- Great design and sturdy standCons:- Requires significant calibration and settings adjustment to get the picture quality desired and remove back light clouding effects.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great purchase so far", "Author": "GolfGryl", "ReviewID": "RSMP98M0EREVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV so far.

The TV found my wireless network and connected right away.  Bummer that Amazon prime is not part of the Samsung Apps, but I have it on my PS3 and Roku so no biggie. The TV is worth the price I paid.

I must say here is I do have a Samsung 3D Blu-ray player with a Sony surround sound receiver - Once I connected the units via HDMI cables - I was ready to use my system the TV/Blu-ray and receiver Sync themselves - NICE!

The buffer on the browser does not even support youtube. Samsung tech support will initially blame your internet provider. I finally ran a computer side by side with the TV to confirm this was not the case. You can only view video within the browser for a very limited time before crashing because the buffer speed is too low. Samsung will advise that you can only view video within the apps supplied, not through the browser. Now this will lead you into a whole new area of frustration. That being that the Samsung keyboard you might have purchased, probably after having purchased a different wireless keyboard to find it had limited functionality with your smart tv (BTW Samsung keyboard only works with 6500 models and above buyer beware) does not have full functionality within some of the apps. To which Samsung replied it was not their tv's fault, but the fault of the app providers. \"Some of the apps on our tv's are not overlayed as Samsung apps and therefor may not have full functionality\". \"They will not allow our keyboard to work within their apps\". Funny, I checked the box, and the user manual, it makes no mention of these issues. This leaves you to work with your tv remote and a pop up keyboard that you must highlight each individual letter with by scrolling and selecting one at a time. Very timely I assure you. But let's assume that you've the patience for that. You will then only be allowed a select number of items to view. Some options, when selected, will say this video not available. Others may stall and wait to buffer and play only seconds at a time freezing in between each.As for the picture, it is not the easiest thing to dial in. You better be pretty savvy to get it where you need it. There will be a lot of adjustments ahead. There are a lot of people who have posted their idea for perfect settings for this tv, right down to adjusting the \"Judder effect\"? It is a bit crisper than my older plasma, but not as bright.Overall, be sure of what you're purchasing this tv for. If it's just to watch tv, you'd probably save more and get just as good a picture without opting for \"smart tv\". If it's because you want smart tv, beware. Unfortunately you don't know what it won't do until you try to use it. Now that I know it's limitations it may go back.

Assembling the TV display to the stand was not difficult.This TV set has a beautiful picture and very good sound, in my opinion.  The sound was a surprise because I can hardly see the speakers.  I appreciate the special setting Samsung has provided for those who are hard of hearing, which accentuates high frequencies.  And I couldn't believe it when I saw that there is even a five-band graphic equalizer.  The characteristics of the picture are widely adjustable and everyone should be able to find settings they are happy with.I give it the highest rating for the foregoing reasons.  I do have two complaints, however.  First, Samsung provides only one set of composite or component (either one, but not both at the same time, obviously) inputs.  Anyone who cares about closed captions will need composite inputs for each peripheral device.  I have bought a separate Monoprice switch for this purpose; I haven't tried it out yet.My other complaint has to do with the absence of an adequate User's Manual.  To be sure, a booklet by that name is provided, but it doesn't tell you much.  It is about one-fourth as long as the manual that came with my previous Philips CRT TV, although with its 3D, wi-fi and internet capability this new TV is several times more complicated.If you have questions not answered by the manual, Samsung invites you to use the e-Manual.  To get to that you have to push about five buttons to get it on the TV screen.  That's much less convenient that having a paper-and-ink booklet in your hand.  Suppose you want to learn how to use 3D.  For that you have to go to the e-Manual; there's nothing about it in the printed manual.  So you read about it in the e-Manual, and when you think you understand it you push about five buttons to get out of the e-Manual, and then another five buttons to call up the 3D adjustment page.  When you start to choose the settings you realize there is something you missed, so you go back to the e-Manual and read it again.  Finally, with some trial and error, you get it right.If you still have questions -- and you will -- you can telephone Samsung's customer care center.  I haven't tried that yet.Samsung provides four pairs of 3D glasses.  That's generous, but again, there are no instructions.  The glasses use batteries, also provided.  They are the kind shaped like a coin.  One side is plus, the other, minus.  Does it make a difference which side is up?  It probably does.  Oh, well, there are only two possibilities, so try one and hope for the best.  There is a tiny button you have to push to turn the glasses on.  In the absence of instructions, it will take you a while to find it.  When you push it, sometimes it flashes green, sometimes red, and sometimes alternating red and green, and sometimes it doesn't flash at all.  Are the glasses trying to tell us something?  Oh, well, if I'm really curious I can telephone the customer care center.To optimize the picture there are separate adjustments for brightness and for backlight intensity.  How do they interact?  If I want the picture to be a little bit lighter, should I turn up the brightness or the backlight?  Oh, well, if I'm really curious I can telephone the customer care center.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best picture on any TV we've owned!", "Author": "LLM", "ReviewID": "RJE13VJQYH5CH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Neither of us are tekkies, just plain old middle agers.

The picture is great and the sound is more than adequate. I didn't give it 5 stars because I think the Smart Portion of the TV could use some improvement.It is great, of course, to be able to watch Internet and personal media on the TV without having to connect the computer psychically to the TV. But the interaction with the \"Smart\" content is far inferior to a regular computer. The TV allows for pairing a Bluetooth mouse, which greatly improve the UI. But using the supplied remote to enter text is very cumbersome.I didn't purchase the optional keyboard, but I do use the \"Samsung Remote\" smartphone app. The app allows for easy text entry in any language your phone is capable of. But many Samsung TV apps don't allow this type of entry and require you to use the on screen letter selection anyway. One way around it is to use the \"Search\" function on the remote. You just search for the title that you want using the smartphone app for text entry and then select among the results what you want. By selecting a \"YouTube\" result you will jump into the YouTube app, but will circumnavigate the need to enter the text through the Samsung TV app.Additionally, the supplied remote often becomes quite unresponsive while watching internet or personal content using WiFi. According to the user manual this is normal.Setting up WiFi was easy on the TV side, but the TV is quite demanding as far as the Internet connection goes. Initially the WiFi content was coming up choppy and the TV was shutting down often and rebooting. I though I might have to return it, but decided to fiddle with my router, which seemed to work just fine before hand. I gave it a shot anyway and glad I did. What worked best for me was connecting my PC to the 5GHz radio and the TV to the 2.4GHz. this way I was able to use separate radios for transmission and for reception. I also increased the 2.4GHz setting to \"up to 300 Mbps\". This resulted in seamless operation of the TV without shutting down and rebooting. I am sharing it because I think you might want to investigate your Internet connection before giving up on the TV itself.I am happy that I purchased this TV and enjoy it very much. While I see some shortcomings with the Smart Content interaction, I think it is just a sign of the times. The smart TV is not so old concept, I am sure that in very short time the UI will improve immeasurably.Enjoy your Samsung ES6580!:)", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Very Happy with the Purchase", "Author": "UofIchief", "ReviewID": "R21A9NGSE5ML9Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bang for the buck, I feel this TV delivers.  The picture is bright and the details are crisp and clear.  The 3D function is nice, but not the reason I bought the TV.  The TV, like nearly all others, takes calibration to get the right picture settings.  I found numerous websites that offered \"ideal\" picture settings, but I still tweaked them to my specific room.  You have a lot of maneuverability in the setting controls to make it right for you. I would definitely make the decision to buy the TV again.Pro's:Nice physical design, with very low profile.Picture is GREAT for it's price range.The sound is better than many competitive products.The WiFi offers a nice functionality.  It may not be lightening fast, but it still streams video and music well.Plenty of A/V and HDMI hookups.Con's:Difficult to wall mount due to the fact that the ethernet, and 2 of the HDMI ports connect at a right angle to your wall.  I actually had to notch out part of the wall bracket to get the TV to sit correctly.  I wish they would have built the ports running parallel with the wall.The universal remote is OK.  I have Comcast and you can access the channel guide, but it takes 2 steps to view the guide instead of using a quick button.  Also, you have to change your selected device to TV to alter the volume.  It would be nice if the volume control automatically adjusted the TV's volume, but not a huge deal to me.

The picture quality is the best I've seen for a 40 inch TV.  Changing some of the TV picture setting was needed to get the best picture.Updating the TVs firmware required an Internet connection.  The firmware was out of date and needed updating.  I carried the assembled TV up and down stairs to connect to the Internet.  The TV is not too heavy but it is awkward for one person to carry on stairs.  Next time, I'll extend the Internet to the TV.Set up of 3D glasses took just a little while.  I did not find the 3D capability to be great.  It is not the same experience as the movie theater.  We rented some 3D movies.  I found that I need to be sitting up to wear the 3D glasses successfully, not slouched on a couch or laying down.Using the SmartTV APPs seems to require a keyboard (and Internet).  I have not bought one yet.  According to what I've read, the Samsung wireless keyboard won't support Netflix.  I see there are alternatives but I wonder why something that seems to simple should be difficult.

The personal experience has been excellent.  Out of the box the set was great, and I hooked it up to Comcast easily.  The DVD and Roku3 also worked immediately.  Problems started with the Smart Hub and hooking up to my wireless ATT router.  Now that things are fixed, I think a speed problem with ATT and DSL is substantially to blame as the Samsung software for the Smart Hub had to be updated and updated.  After a few days, I finally found on the net a fix, or so I thought, by putting in a public DNS code, which I still use.I trolled the net and came up with the opinion that the Samsung does not recognize the D.N.S. code, which you have to change.  By fiddling around with the Network Status submenu, you can change the D.N.S. to 8.8.8.8  I know this is weird, but one blogger said this is a code that goes with Google.  In any case, when I put this in, things began to happen.  First, SyncPlus was loaded which is some commercial vehicle between Yahoo and Samsung (no thanks).  Then my registration took and held, and I got the web browser to work, pretty quickly at that, with MSN as the browser site.  Note, you will need a USB ready keyboard.

It is as close to plug and play as you can get. I was lucky enough to catch this on a 1 day sale on 1/25 and saved $300.  Unfortunately the first TV I received was damaged.  I got it all unboxed and set up in about 20 min only to find a HUGE crack across the bottom.  I called the Tech Support line and within 15min the woman had a new one on the way for next day delivery and a call tag into UPS to pick up the old one.  The hardest part of the return process was packaging it up.  The next morning around 10am UPS arrived to pick up the old TV and drop off the new one.  This one was packed much more securely, and was up and running in 15 min.So far I have downloaded the Amazon Cloud Player, Amazon Instant Videos, and Netflix.  All work great.  I have not yet tried skype so I cannot speak about the webcam but I have tried the 3D.  It was great.The glasses are fairly comfortable.  I have a small nose so glasses tend to slide down and bother me but these were lightweight so I could wear them for the entire movie w/o issue.I can see how web browsing would be an issue but I have a laptop, and blackberry and an 8.5\" Kindle Fire already in the living room so I really don't need to use my TV to surf the web.  If you are expecting your TV to be a computer then you need to get a TV with a dual core processor.The picture is great on HD channels.  Pretty crummy on regular channels but that is to be expected.I have only found one channel that I can't get in HD so this is not an issue.  I know that some people have complained about cloudiness. I haven't had that issue.  I do select the picture setting based on what I am watching.  Some shows look great in dynamic and others look terrible.  Same for the other settings.  Just choose the setting that suits the lighting in the room as well as the show you are watching.  I was not a fan of smooth motion until I got this TV.  I used to think it looked like a soap opera.  Now I love it, I am not sure if I have gotten used to it or if my TV has a higher smooth motion rate than other TVs I have watched previously.I love that I can watch a movie using the smart capabilities even when my DVR is recording 2 shows already.  Overall I love this TV.  The only think I regret is that I did not get a larger one.  I was too impatient to wait for a post Super Bowl delivery of the 50\" but wish I hadn't been.  The price of the 50\" on 1/25 was $100 less than the 46\" is today.

The decision to buy Samsung became very obvious after reading many reviews and viewing all of the TVs in Best Buy.I wasn't necesarrily looking for 3D but most of the higher end smart TV's have this feature.  I'm pleasantly surprised at the 3D quality based on demo DVDs.  I don't own a 3D blue ray yet but there is no doubt that I will be purchasing one.  This TV has a 2D to 3D conversion function that enables you to watch any program that is broadcast via cable or satellite in 3D.  This is not quite as impressive as a program or movie that was shot in 3D but it's pretty darn good.  I especially enjoy watching football games and other sports in this mode.  This TV comes with 4 pair of 3D glasses that are comfortable to wear.As far as the 2D picture quality goes, this TV is among the best.  It's extremely sharp with vivid color and contrast.  Cable companies do not deliver 1080p programming but the Smart TV function allows me to watch HBO GO, Netflix and MLB TV in 1080p as the picture is streamed through the internet via my wireless router.The Smart TV feature is best for watching video as mentioned above.  You can also get HULU and many other internet TV stations.  The web browser is a little slow but adequate for socail media, email and surfing the WEB but I prefer my laptop over the TV for these functions.This is a great TV for the price and I can't say that there is any negative attributes.

But I jumped to the head of the class when I selected this one - the 46\" 6580. Here's my non-techy \"couch potato\" review:3D - this is really good quality.  Everyone is amazed that I can sit in my living room and watch Avatar just like we did in the theater.  This TV comes with 4 pairs of glasses that have a tiny button to activate.  They turn themselves off if you disconnect from 3D content, a battery-saving feature. They fit comfortably over my glasses and on 4 year old children.Sound - above average. I have not been compelled to buy a sound system.  The sound quality is a priority for me, and a leading consumer magazine rated this higher than average, and this was an important purchasing factor.2D - excellent high def. (I refuse to watch non-high def content.)  I'm not put off by the supposed lack of deep blacks - I think you must have to be really picky to even notice this because it's not noticeable to me.SMART TV - I have not yet purchased a keyboard to use with my TV so I haven't bothered to do much web browsing.  As noted by other reviewers, the YouTube app won't use the keyboard anyway, and you have to navigate an onscreen keyboard using up, down, left, right \"cursor keys\".  A big disappointment to me is that there is a lot of content that YouTube is blocking.  To quote a blog on the subject: \"Currently device syndication affects TV's as well as mobile devices. Due to content restrictions, some content providers may not be allowed to syndicate a video on mobile or TV, or they may choose to only show their videos on the desktop.\"  So it's not a Samsung issue, it's a YouTube policy.Overall I am very satisfied with my TV - I made the right choice.PS - the biggest regret people have about their TV is that they don't get one big enough.

I set up my DVD player going into component with one profile and my tivo with cable into one of the hdmi inputs with another. Now pictures are awesome. I had heard that sound was really bad on this but I don't find that to be the case at all.  I have this sitting on desk on bedroom 8-10 feet away with tv 4 inches away from wall on stand. I think it gets extra bass this way and is plenty loud.  I also connected an old JVC iPod dock set with amp and mini sattelites and sub woofer which I use only when playing DVDs. I use the mini plug out into mini plug in. There is a buzzing when no signal but sounds awesome when movie plays.The stand that comes with set is kind of chintzy.

Sound is low and after using this TV for 1 month, I have decided to buy Samsung Sound Bar for better sound. But, I understood from many people that every smart TV (across brands) has this issue. So, I am not upset with this.2. Samsung has to come up with more Apps.3. Youtube app is not so great. It does not work like ur regular youtube. Typing/searching for videos is very cumbersome.4. Using remote for typing in web browser is not friendly. But, I am not having any issue as I am using Samsung Remote app on my Android phone.Overall: I am loving my purchase and enjoying its functionalities very much.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Great Customer Service", "Author": "Adam McEwen", "ReviewID": "R3DSZE40KYLKXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After hemming an hawing for over a year I narrowed my search to this and a comprable Sony set.

For a smart TV, it could easily have been better, and I think I made a mistake by going for this instead of the 6500 that is a little cheaper and should have been no different.Pros:1. Easy setup2. Great clarity, and audio is too good for this thin a TV3. Useful apps - The youtube app works very well for playing videos, if you know the ones you want to play and can find them; Skype just works and works great4. Wi-Fi is reasonably good, a little rough, but works for all the basic purposes very wellCons:1. Wi-Fi could have been better2. The camera is NOT built-in, it is just an accessory that ties up one of your USB ports - It may work well cheaper and easier to buy the camera stand-alone3. Keyboard/Mouse won't work with most of the in-built apps - for e.g., you can't use these with the YouTube app, only have to use the remote for the keyboard :(4. 3D is practically useless - It is hard to make it work in the first go. You need to have the background (behind the TV) pretty dark if you want to get the 3D effect, otherwise you won't even see it5. Software Updates using the WiFi is a little convoluted - You need to power the TV off and then power it on again if you know there is an update for your TV and want to install it6. Browser cannot be used for any multimedia - It runs out of memory even if you watch a 5-minute clip online. YouTube is the only solution to watch videos7. Remote is very very weak - You can't type easily with it; Seeking in youtube videos with the remote is almost a no-go; If you try to use the remote from beyond 10 feet, it just won't work; It is very very slow, doesn't respond to presses8. Don't expect the Samsung AllShare app to work if you don't have an Android - it just isn't there for Windows phones9. UNRELATED TO THE TV ITSELF - Be very wary of ordering anything big with Amazon.com, their (enhanced) delivery mechanism was awful;  a. It came 10 days after it was supposed to have reached me  b. They have a very narrow window when they will deliver the item for you, if you don't live in a major city (like Richardson instead of Dallas)  c. You get no prior notification on when they will come, they just come home and call you. If you say you will be home in 10 minutes, they won't wait for you  d.

At just about the 3 month ownership interval, the volume control/mute would not function from my FIOS remote. I thought I had mistakenly pressed some control that caused this . I turned the TV off , then on and everything was okay. A couple of weeks later, the same thing happened. I fugure that it's my fault again.  A couple more weeks go by and the same problem crops up again, but several times during the week and even several times a day. NEITHER the Samsung or FIOS remote would control the volume/mute functions. I placed calls to Costco and to Samsung. Spent several hours with them for Samsung to come to a conclusion that the  remote was defective. I receive a new remote, same problem again a few days later. Calls & on hold to Samsung for HOURS. Also, had to speak with rep from Service Quick repair center & explain the whole thing again. THEY decide is it the main board(all inputs & processing). Wait at home for FOUR hour window. Board is replaced. Ten days later, the same problem. I'm on the phone again for a couple of hours. This time THEY decide to replace the  function board(IR & Bluetooth). Several weeks pass, then the same problem happens again! Costco will do NOTHING for me. I tell Samsung that I want a NEW TV to replace this one. I told them they hade made THREE repair attempts and still the same problem arose. Their response was that they did not consider the remote replacement a repair attempt. I argued that it was & continued to push the matter to their \"executive\" team. After another hour long telephone call, they finally agreed to replace the TV with a new one. Several days passed & I received a  call to replace the TV with a new 2013 model. If I had not intoned that I might like to by a larger TV, I would never had been offered the option of a buy back. I took this route. Several more week pass while I wait for the process of receiving my check grinds through.  While I am waiting, the TV brings up a dialog box with \"Low or no signal\". I check every connection, cable, etc. I reprogram per on-screen Samsung instructions. Nothing works. I move this TV out of the way & put a smaller Vizio in its place. Everything works as it should on the Vizio. Finally, a trucking firm hired by Samsung picks up the TV on a Friday. I receive my check on Monday via UPS 2nd day air.

Then when I went to contact them and they want to know what model Tv I have my tv is not even in the pull down menu where all their models are listed. upon doing research it seems like everyone is trying to find a keyboard that works with their tv. Samsung suggests that you buy their model vg-kbd1500 which is $100.00. Multiple places I checked it is out of stock. It seems many people are not happy with this one when they do get it and do return it. If you  just want a tv and not the web features this is a great tv. The picture is great. I have not tried the 3D feature and do not know if I will. So if you are thinking of this model and want a keyboard to operate it please do some research. Just adding a update to this review. I just purchased the Logitech k400 wireless keyboard and it works very good with this tv. The mouse pad works good once you hit the key on the remote to activate the pointer. The price on the K400 is a lot less then the $100.00 that the Samsung model is.
