Let me say that I made the right decision. I received the TV only 4 days after ordering. Very fast shipping I must say, and not to have paid extra. I was so excited!!Set up was a breeze!! I had no problems connecting to my wireless connection and was online and streaming Netflix in 10 minutes. Worked right away with my DirecTV, and works great with all DirecTV's HD channels. Awesome picture, and it has options for wide screen, normal, zoom, or panoramic viewing. Most of the time I have it set to Zoom option, which uses the whole screen. And the sound quality is the best!! At just 10 volume, it is plenty loud enough for me. I turned it up to 30 and could hear it throughout my house!!I've had this TV for 2 months now, and I absolutely love it!!I would highly recommend this model if you are looking for a TV that offers HD and Wifi, and yes, I brag about it to all my friends and family!!Again, AWESOME TV AND AWESOME PRICE!!UPDATE--1-26-2013AFTER ALMOST 6 MONTHS LATER, TV IS STILL GOING STRONG AND HAVE HAD NO ISSUES. I STILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TV IF YOUR IN THE MARKET FOR ONE!!

Updates a few months later are below.The quality of the picture on this TV is absolutely amazing. It was simple to hook up and set up right out of the box. It accessed our home wi-fi network very easily and the quality of pictures streamed from Netflix was beautiful. No issues with connectivity at all.The menu is simple and intuitive to use. Initial set up (where you input your IP address, home address, Netflix information etc) can be a bit annyoing since the remote does not have letter keys but once done there is really no need to have to deal with that again. The only apps I have tried out so far are Netflix and Pandora. The sound quality when playing music is more than adequate for my needs.While it does not have the 120 Hz that supposedly helps while watching sports we have not noticed any issues with it being 'only' 60 Hz.Initially, when connected to our old AV equipment, the picture displayed on the tv was quite poor. However, that had more to do with the VCR/DVD and cable quality than with the tv. With the older dvd player we couldn't get the picture to be quite 'right' and the automatic backlight adjustment needed to be turned off. Once we switched to a blu ray player that upscaled our dvd's the picture was absolutey amazing. So, if you are using older equipment you may not see the full potential of what this tv can do.Also, since the TV is Wi-Fi capable we bough a blu ray that was a bit cheaper since it lacked wi fi but was excellent at upscaling dvd's. Samsung BD-E5300 Blu-ray Disc Player (Black)The tv has 3 HDMI inputs, one component input and one usb input. Our kids have their Wii hooked up using the component input and a regular 3 prong AV cable and, while nowhere near an HD picture, it works. The Wii does not have the HDMI option so the picture quality is a bit disappointing for wii games. The newer version of the Wii should function just fine.Warranty signup was easily done online and I did speak to the Vizio customer service (based in the US) to double check a few things and everthing went very well.We have only had this tv for less than a week but, so far, we are extremely pleased with it.Update Sept 2012: Still a terrific TV. Start up is a bit annoying especially if you use it only to stream Netflix or Amazon since it takes a good 2-3 minutes just to get the app started. Otherwise, everything has been excellent and we are still very pleased with the purchase.Update Jan 2013 : Stuck on vizio logo on startup. Chatted with vizio and they will have a tech contact me in 5 working days to schedule a repair. From what I am seeing online the main board seems to be an issue with this brand. I am very disappointed that this would happen with a six month old tv. I will post updates once service is completed. At this point I would not recommend buying a smart tv or a Vizio. Better to go with a blu ray that has the apps and a tv that just does one job  - being a tv.Update March 2013 : Took Vizio about three weeks to get a contractor out to fix the tv. He had to replace the entire mother board. Frankly, had they shipped to me with instructions I could have done it myself but it was under warranty so I suppose they had to do it. Three weeks felt like a very long time considering that you can get a part shipped cross country within a day in today's world. The tv is still lovely with a nice picture and sound but it is slowing down again on start up. If it dies again I will update this review. Otherwise, it is still alive and kicking!Update May 2013 : The saga continues! Still a beautiful picture but last week we started having issues with the remote control. Everything would start up fine for a few minutes and then only the power button on the remote would work. Contacted vizio about this via chat and, after doing some resetting of the remote and tv with no improvement, they sent out a new remote. The remote arrived in less than a week but did not fix the problem. While talking to vizio and trying to reset things, the back panel buttons on the tv conked out and then we got the lovely black screen of death for a few minutes. Vizio is, without any arguments but some expression of frustration on my part, going to send out a recertified (but NOT refurbished) identical tv. The rep emphasized that refurbished tv had repairs done whereas a recertified tv was just out of box or a customer return that they ahd to test and recertify as having nothing wrong with it.Should be here in two weeks and hopefully should work like a charm. I am pleased with vizio for customer service. Got a live American agent in less than one minute every time and they were very prompt and proactive in figuring out the problem. Not so pleased with the product itself but hopefully this particular tv was just a lemon!Update July2013. The recertified set was delivered very quickly and the delivery guys set it up perfectly. Unfortunately, it came with quirks of it's own. This one starts up fine but the volume controls, and sometimes the input selection, will not respond for the first five minutes. Wait it out and it work perfectly after that. Picture and sound, like the first set, are lovely. So, this was NOT an ideal purchase but with the 5 years of extended warranty I got with this thing, I'll be sticking with it for a while.I fully expect more issues with this thing within a year but don't think any more updates are necessary - this is not a TV I would recommend to anyone.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vizio E322AR", "Author": "The P", "ReviewID": "RQ2901FN9EKQ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS:Just bought this TV the other night and setup was easy, from a hardware point of view. Electronically connected to my DTV box and my home network with little effort, albeit, the remote was a bit touchy.Picture is what I would expect from a 720p unit of this size, clear and precise, good blacks with no artifacts visible.Sound is good with the surround turned on (from a surround broadcast channel).All-in-all, a great TV for the price, didn't really think I was going to find a \"smart\" tv in this 32\" range with as many pre-loaded apps as this one has.If you're looking for a smaller (32\") unit that will preform well in a bright light room, that can be seen from almost any angle, look at this model from Vizio.CONS:setup requires you to input some things with alpha-numeric characters and the remote only has numeric . . . keyboard is supplied on screen but navigates slowly until you get the hang of it.I had to use a Samsung code for my DTV remote to interface with this TV, the Vizio codes didn't work (probably too new for DTV to even know about it yet).

Frankly the TV is buggy for my tastes.  The latest thing that displeased me is I could not get audio from my laptop to run through the TV speakers (PC audio in). So if you want to use this as a computer monitor, it's a major compromise.  Driver updates didn't work, trying HDMI audio didn't work, and I did a store exchange and the replacement didn't work either. Finally, Vizio tech support essentially blamed my computer (even though I've had no problems getting sound when I hook it up to other TVs. If someone here has solved this, and can leave a comment or tip, I'll gladly revoke the downgrade.)Here's my original review, which noted some other bugs.____I've owned several HDTVs and I think this TV has some strengths, but some bugs and weaknesses.PRO-Price is great for a web enabled TV-Quickly found my wifi network-Apps store is nice, lots of free choices. Weather, news, radio, Facebook, Twitter etc-Picks up channels via antenna as well as my name brand TVs do-Light and small profile for its size makes it a nice choice for small rooms-Use some apps (like weather and news) while watching TV.  MULTITASKERS rejoice! (I might have given the TV 3 stars instead of 4 until it exceeded my expectations here)-Customer service was easy to reach.CON-Remote clashes with LG TV and my Altec Lansing mini stereo, they seem to share some but not all remote functions-Some apps are buggy, lock up-Sound is good but not great, with some menu tweaks it improves-Menu system not very intuitive and kind of clunky-Small remote buttons-Viewing quality at side angles diminishes-Not a thin set, light and small footprint but chunky in back-USB flash drive appears to have an 8gb max. Wasn't mentioned in manual.-A little slow to power up, and then more lag time to connect to the web-App limit - you can only load a maximum of about 15 apps.-I'm having trouble getting audio to the TV from a PC.  Customer service not much help.I put this TV in my kitchen, which I think is about the right place for it.  I think I'll enjoy the option to play music and news with the apps, check Facebook and stream video, and to pull up news headlines and weather info while I wait for water to boil or during commercials etc.  Picture and sound are good for a budget TV and I hope to get better views with some more tweaking. However, I don't think I'd want to use this as my primary TV because of some of the compromises listed above.So far, I prefer turning the surround sound off, but setting the speakers to \"Rock\" mode to amplify the bass a bit. I find the video looks best in \"vivid\" mode in my brightly lit room.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV...very pleased", "Author": "NMSewHappy", "ReviewID": "R3C1OPQFXV0GTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV at a great price!  The picture is clear, the sound is crisp and the setup was relatively easy.  My previous TV is 10 years old and way before current technology.  I have a cable box and as I expected I needed an additional cable to hookup my new TV, but didn't know exactly what I needed until the TV arrived.  I got a HDMI cable and connected the cable box to the TV HDMI outlet and got it setup.  When I first turned the TV on the setup would have been simple, if I had known what I needed to connect my cable box to the TV (my lack of knowledge not the TV)!  The coax connection is only if you are hooking up an antenna, not for use with a cable box. The Quick Guide would be much better if it said:  click on Menu on the remote, then Help and under help is the full owners manual.Setting up my wireless network was a snap...that was the easiest for me.  There is a Netflix and Amazon button on the remote.  Netflix was simple, login just like online.  The TV gives you a code for Amazon and as you are directed on the screen you have to register that code with Amazon for Prime Instant movies etc.  The V button on the remote also has a menu of apps and connections to Netflix, Amazon, etc.If you are not an Amazon Prime member, signup.  Its a bargain.  Just as many movies, TV shows, etc as NetFlix and you get free 2 day shipping for $79/yr.  That's cheaper than $7.99/mo.Even if I would have had to call my cable company to install this TV, it would be well worth the price.  Fortunately, I did it myself.  Other reviewers have said \"it's only 720p.\" For me, this screen, sound and smart functions are wonderful.  Of course, I only use a cell phone for calls too so my needs are simple and this TV is the perfect size for my living room.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Affordable Internet app TV.

However due to cost, and less of a high usage, I decided to purchase 2 of these Vizio HDTV's for my home. I bought a 22\" for the kitchen and this 32\" for my boy's bedroom. I mounted it about a foot from the ceiling so that he can't get his slimy little hands on it. The TV is great, it is very light, solid and the picture quality is great. For what it is the sound quality is also nice and just right for what I am using it for.I really enjoy all the apps and he mostly watches Netflix. It is quick and easy to use. I also like the Netflix and Amazon buttons on the remote. As another revewer stated there are no composite hookups for this TV. I had to order a component cable from Amazon to hook up my son's DVD player to this TV.I will still always have my SONY 55\" HDTV in the living room for main use, however Vizio is great for other TV's placed around the house. I think it was a great deal for such a nice HDTV. I would recommend it for the bedroom, kitchen or other area but NOT for your main living room HDTV because it is only 720p and the audio is not the best. For my uses in my son's room to watch Netflix and a few childrens DVD's it is perfect!I needed some more information, like wall mounting hold pattern, so I checked out the Vizio web site and posted all the product information below.Screen Size:32\" ClassDiagonal Viewable:31.5\"Backlight Type:CCFLResolution:720pDynamic Contrast Ratio:100,000:1Refresh Rate:60HzResponse Time:8.5 msViewable Angle (H/V):176\u00b0/176\u00b0OSD Language:English, Spanish, FrenchAudioSRS StudioSound(tm):YesSRS TruSurround HD(tm):YesSRS TruVolume(tm):YesSpeakers/Power Output:2 x 10WConnections - InputsHDMI:3 (rear)Component:1 (rear)Composite:1 (shared with component input)PC:1 VGA (rear)RF Antenna:1 (rear)Ethernet:1 (rear)USB Ports:1 (rear)Connections - OutputsDigital Audio Out (SPDIF):1 (rear)Analog Audio Out:1 (3.5mm) (rear)Multimedia SupportMusic:YesPhoto:YesVideo:YesDLNA:NoAdditional FeaturesVIA (VIZIO Internet Apps):Yes3D File Formats Supported:n/aSmart Dimming:NoSmooth Motion:NoAmbient Light Sensor:YesWiFi:802.11nBluetooth:NoHDMI CEC:YesHDMI ARC:YesPIP (Picture in Picture):NoMercury Free:NoRemote Control:Yes3D Glasses:n/aCertifications:UL, CUL, FCC Class B, HDMI 1.4 incl.

You have to use the Vizio remote for Netflix, Amazon, etc but the cable remote  works for everything else. At first the cable remote wouldn't work the volume, but cable guy fixed it. The colors and sound are good and it has a smart feature that selects the correct brightness for the room, but you can also select this and all the settings manuallyl. It's lightweight and can be wall mounted with the proper mount. There are lots of different ports, including USBs for multimedia content. There was a problem connecting to Netflix for the first time because I didn't get the code I was supposed to get and Netflix had no idea. (No problems connecting to amazon.com video library, etc.) When I called Vizio, they  had me reset the TV to all the default settings and start over. This was a bit of a hassle, but it fixed the problem. The cable guy helped me to get the right display settings, too. So there is a learning curve to this TV, but it may just be me, because I hadn't had TV for 3 years. (I had been using a digital projector and my purchased/rented dvds.) I still can't find anything to watch on cable, but I love my Vizio with Netflix and my Amazon video library. Also, this TV arrived fast in perfect condition, even though the packaging was minimal.

It seems tailor-made for people like me, who have ditched the cable box and watch TV elusively via the internet.The remote has 3 quick-keys that direct immediately to Amazon streaming (which seems glitchy, a couple TV shows I was watching stopped streaming partway through), Netflix (which works perfectly), and Vudu (which I've only browsed, but haven't yet watched any movies). In addition to those, you can hit the Menu button and bring up the additional apps, including Pandora, Hulu+, and a bunch of Yahoo apps like Weather, News Headlines, etc. What I love about the smart TV is that because all these services are built into the TV, it saves me the hassle of hooking up my computer to my TV, and there's no rats-nest of wires under the console.The major drawback to this TV is as other reviewers have mentioned, there is a lag between when you hit the power button on the remote until the TV finally turns on. Essentially you're waiting for the computer inside to boot up. This is also noticeable when you hit the menu button or quick keys to use Amazon, Netflix, or Vudu.

Our small kitchen Vizio has been a trouble free television with a decent picture.Set up wasn't bad, a litte tedious made more so by the inclusion of the Comcast box in the mix. The stand is really shaky and not sturdy or large enough for this television. I like the remote which has keys dedicated to internet channels, but with Comcast we must use their remote. The Vizio remote is only used for internet surfing.Sound - The sound is more than acceptable for us. Not overly impressive but good enough for us.  There are lots of settings for the sound that I haven't dabbled with yet, so maybe the sound can be improved a bit.Wait time - The TV doesn't turn on instantly and there is a waiting period for the internet to crank up. Can be annoying for the impatient.Picture - It's good but without the quality that would blow one away. Our basic Comcast service doesn't include HD quality which is part of the reason I can't rave about the picture. However, I have watched HD movies using Netflix and have accessed over the air HD channels with an indoor antenna. The HD picture is excellent, the kind of picture I was hoping for all the time. Those who have upper tier Comcast or FIOS will most likely be very satisfied with the picture on this TV.There are lots of ways to fine tune the picture and some preprogrammed modes like Movie, Vivid, Standard, Custom, Golf, Football, Movie, Baseball, Game.  I've had the best success with Game and Vivid modes.The remote has dedicated buttons for Amazon, Netflix, and Vudu.  Pressing the large V button in the middle of the remote brings on a list of internet channels that scroll across the screen. The list can be modified with additions or subtractions.  Netflix is great to watch and access. Amazon is terrible to access with tedious and limited access. There are lots of complaints by Amazon buyers for this reason. It's much easier to watch and choose movies on Amazon using Roku or the Amazon site on the computer.Set up for wireless wasn't too bad. Even this Potato Head figured it out.Would I buy this set again? Probably not for two reasons.First I am very disappointed by the crude Amazon interface on this television and in fact hardly ever watch any kind of internet on this TV. It was a novelty that soon wore off.Second, and I knew this would happen, I regret not buying a larger television for the living room. Our sofa is twelve feet plus from the television; I misjudged the size of the television. A 47\" TV like I almost bought would have been perfect.Should you buy this TV?

But it wasn't easy to get there, and with the automatics on, the picture was simply terrible.Sound quality was equally troublesome. The fake surround sound it absolutely unintelligible with some signals. Once again, turning off all the fancy stuff and manually adjusting the equalizer seems to be the best option.Once you do all that, you've got a good basic 32 inch TV, but if you're not into tweaking, this is not the set for you.Does a very good job of showing video from  an 8 gig (max) thumb drive and also does a good job streaming video from Amazon.

This is response to my inquiry regarding this model not being featured on the compatibly listing.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Purchased this TV in July. It arrived quickly,in fine condition. This is my first experience with High Definition TV. Therefore, I am not real savvy. The TV appears to be fine with the exception of some occasional scratchy noises viewing Turner Classic Movies.My cable service changed out the cable box and set up the TV. The next day a very electronic savvy friend arrived at my home and we attempted to connect to the internet by utilizing the Ethernet cable from my modem. We were not successful. Don't have wireless service.We called Vizio customer technical support for assistance. He was unable to resolve the problem and suggested we revert back to the factory default and try again. Still did not work.A second call was made to Vizio. She informed us that their was a communication issue and advised we call the cable tv provider for assistance.After contacting the cable tv provider we were assured that all equipment was in working order. This left us feeling unsure what to do next.A previous troubleshooting call had been scheduled with the cable tv provider for problems unrelated to the internet connection. Solution: Cable technician refreshed the DCHP and matched the IP numbers, then downloaded the internet. If the outcome had not been not favorable I was prepared to return the product.*Vizio technicians should have been able to offer a solution to this problem. Quite frankly, this experience left me with a great deal of doubt weather I had made the right choice by purchasing a Vizio product. *Something is seriously lacking when a first time purchaser can not get help from highly trained technical experts.

Thought no big deal will contact Vizio since the tv is still under warranty.  Contacted Vizio ran through all their tech support hoops determined TV is broke - I cannot return TV to store and get a replacement must get it repaired OK. \"The repair company will contact you within 72 hours\" I was told both over the phone and via email.  A week later I contacted the repair company and they said Vizio did not have the parts and that I was to contact Vizio.  I asked why did you not call me to let me know the repair company replied \"Vizio said they would contact you we are not involved any more.\"  So I contacted Vizio and they had to check and run through more hoops - yes parts are out of stock (they could not tell this the week prior?) we will have to arrange to have a \"Recertified\" tv sent out to you and the company will contact you in 8-13 business days.  8-13 business days which translates to 2-3 weeks for just the call to arrange for delivery.So for a TV that is only 6 months old it sits broken for over 18 days and I am still waiting for this company to call me to let me know when they can deliver a \"Recertified\" TV.  While I may not know exactly what a \"Recertified\" TV is but I am sure it is not a NEW TV.Vizio products are great when they work - I have several but my 1st experience with their warranty is not good at all.

This was the last of this model available in my metro area.I had initially planned to buy a regular TV and a Roku box to run apps, which is a setup that a family member of mine has and I really liked. I primarily use my TV to stream Amazon Prime or Pandora, which generally work great after waiting a few minutes for the TV to turn on and connect to wifi. I can't say that I love the format of the apps, but again, for the price I can't complain.Overall I'm extremely impressed with the HD picture quality (using a BluRay player or streaming HD movies on Vudu) and sound. My main issue with this TV is the slow processor - as you'll read in other reviews, it takes a few minutes for the apps to load and scrolling through the menu can be laggy. I would love to see Vizio create an app that is compatible with iPhone and Android (like Roku has) that would enable typing, as searching Amazon, Pandora, YouTube, etc. can be a pain, especially with the lag.

These new TV's just don't last like the old analog ones of which I can't remember but one repair for a lightening hit in all my 40 adult years .Bottom line if it would hurt you to have to buy a new tv every year based on my experience I would purchase the tv where you can get a affordable replacement warranty that pays shipping both ways and keep the box for the whole period .You cannot leave these in motorhomes or in a unheated room either like the old analongs . The tv is good itself and has a VGA input the newer ones do not . The speakers are not as good as Toshibas for instance . The remote is very nice but I prefer Bluetooth instead of having to point .

I ended up purchasing the E322AR at another store (think \"Bullseye\") for the same price as Amazon.com.  After getting it home and setting it up, and using it for about a week now, here are my impressions.+ PROS ++ Picture is great, with lots of adjustments+ Controls and menu are relatively simple+ Pretty good amount of apps to choose from..although there could be a few more+ One of the only 720p 32\" Smart TVs on the market- CONS -- Sound is tinny and empty- VIA App interface is sluggish; way more so than my older E322VLSo ultimately, I am comparing this model to the E322VL that I have had for two years. They are essentially the same TV, except the E322VL is full HD.  My main complaint about the E322AR is how sluggish the VIA app interface is. In fact, you really need to wait 30+ seconds after turning the TV on in order to even use the VIA apps, or else the entire app interface tends to freeze up like an old computer!  This is quite interesting, because my E322VL is much more responsive.Other than that, I am satisfied with the model, especially given the price.

(as well as Netflix and Vudu)It took me a little while to dial in all the video settings as the factory defaults are less than desirable.

We called Vizio and they apparently were going to order the part Monday morning and the TV should have been fixed by Friday (one week from it breaking).  However, they wrote down the wrong model number and the wrong telephone number, so when I called to check up on the status of a replacement part 4 days later, they informed me that they had left me messages with me regarding needing the correct number.  Since they had the wrong number I never got these messages.  They then said they were ordering a part (they assumed it was the correct part, since no one ever came to our home to diagnose), and that it should be here the following Wednesday (now going one 1.5 weeks).  I called that Wed and the part had just shipped and they informed me it would be 3-5 business days before the repair guy would get it, so now going on 2 weeks until part actually gets here then we will have to schedule repair, so going on 3 weeks now (2 weeks after it was supposed to be fixed).  After numerous calls to Vizio and asking them to expedite the part since the original problem (wrong numbers) were not our fault, they basically told us there was nothing they could do (i.e. no overnighting the part, etc).

Review update:  After hooking up and getting all the kinks worked out I am downgrading my review for one big reason. This TV contains apps that are not even compatible with the TVs technology.  YouTube WILL NOT play on this TV yet is one of the touted apps as well as the Web Videos app.  Those cant play either because the technologies for buffering arent compatible.  There is no way these functioned properly at Vizio during testing. If you go to Google and search this you will see stream after stream of discussion about Vizio Smart Tvs and how none of them, high or low end will play You Tube properly. This has been a huge complaint before they ever MADE my TV let alone the time I purchased it yet they did nothing about it. ~ Just took it out of the box and got it hooked up.

As other reviews state, it will smell like fresh electronics for about 3 days after its first use. This is from leftover residue from the manufacturing process, and it's harmless.It does take about 10-15 seconds to boot up after you press the power button, which seems like a long time. Keep in mind it has to actually boot up, and it doesn't have much processing power. It then must connect to your router before you can access the apps. I don't mind any of this at all because our old tube screen couldn't do a fraction of what this TV can.The picture is great, as with most LCD screens. HD channels look amazing. Sound quality is superb. Deep, rich lows and clear highs all through its range. It won't shake your walls with bass, of course, but it sounds fantastic.The apps are mostly useless, but the exceptions are, well, exceptionally useful. We use Netflix, Pandora, The Weather Channel, and Media apps the most. The Weather Channel app allows us to personalize our locations so we can check our local weather from the couch while watching TV or movies or listening to music. Very cool. You can also set more locations, I think around 5, so you can check the weather where your relatives are, or your favorite ski resort, or park, or whatever. The Media app, however, is the bees knees. It allows us to connect through wi-fi to our media libraries on our computer. All the music, movies, tv-shows we have are accessible through the tv. Certain aspect ratios aren't supported, but 90% of the AVI files I have work. The others we can watch through the Xbox.Of course the TV also has the full range of adjustability options, such as picture (with settings for sports, movies, news, even backlight and automatic ambient light compensation settings), audio, closed captioning, sleep timer.Apps appear in a row at the bottom of the screen and can be added, deleted, or moved around easily. While using an app, you have the option of adjusting the screen ratio on the right 2/3 of the screen for optimum viewing while using the app. I mean it's just silly the amount of engineering went into this thing.The only downside: Only one USB camera is currently compatible with Vizio TVs, and it's hard to find. If you plan on using the Skype app (also very cool), find one of those cameras (Vizio XCV100). We have Xbox Kinect so we don't need it. That's it.

I go to the living room and watch the same program, using the same app, on my dvd player manufactured by another company and I have no problems.I realized that the apps on my wonderful TV are powered by Yahoo.

Can anyone remember Musicmatch Jukebox and how Yahoo screwed it up?I can watch Amazon streams with on one problem - I can add shows to my watchlist for Amazon on my computer and DVD player in different rooms but I can't access the watchlist on my Vizio TV in my bedroom (Thanks Yahoo).  Also the menu for Amazon Streaming sucks on my TV (Thanks Yahoo).  I go to my Sony Blue-Ray player in the living room and zip through to the programs I want to see (Thanks Sony).  I can watch Amazon Streaming (which I think is great by the way) but Hulu Plus doesn't play well at all on my Vizio TV.  Today I tried Hulu Plus on my Vizio and the program was choppy and the sound and picture dragged.  I turned off my TV and went to my Blue Ray Player in the living room and have no problem watching Hulu Plus (and thanks Sony for the three month Hulu Plus Trial Membership - I love it)Don't get me wrong, Vizio makes a wonderful TV but they need to partner with another company.  If I had known that Vizio was using Yahoo I make not have bought this set.  I'm hoping that future that Yahoo gets its act together but if it's any indication by the way their Yahoo Email works then we're all in trouble.  Are you listening Vizio?

Amazon is trying to nickle and dime me to charge me a restocking fee of $60.34 because they sent me 2 lemons of this TV!Both TVs had a bad wifi card inside of them and I confirmed this with Vizio top level support.I will never buy another TV from Amazon because of this experience having to call amazon on numerous occasions to deal with there refund department. They did not make it easy to return the TV and get a full refund.You are better off just going to Costco and getting the TV so you can return it if necessary with no hassles. I learned my lesson the hard way.I buy alot of stuff off Amazon and have been a Prime member for years. I cant believe how tough they made it.Original Review:I bought this TV from Amazon for my kids room. I love the netflix and amazon prime apps and kids use it all the time.The problem is that the wifi setup worked when I first set it up. Then the next day it wouldnt connect to my wifi?I contacted Vizio Tech chat and they walked me through how to reset the hardware. After the reset I was able to connect to wifi again.After 1 more day it wouldnt connect to wifi again.Anyone else have this problem?I am using an Apple Airport Extreme and an Apple Airport Express as a bridge or whatever you call it. But that shouldnt matter since the TV will connect to the wifi for at least 1 day or until the TV is turned off.I should also mention that I bought a Vizio 3D TV (M3D470KD) from Costco and it has stayed connected to my wifi for over 2 weeks with no problems.Do I have a lemon? Should I send it back to Amazon for a replacement or just get a refund and buy another model?Thanks.UPDATE:I got a 2nd tv from amazon as it was a lemon as well.
