However... for an $580 TV I have found quite a few things I am very unhappy with, that I didn't really consider before buying.-the TruSound feature had to be turned off within the first two hours... horrible volume fluctuation at the wrong times...-from the time you push the power button expect about 15 seconds before you see a picture (seriously I counted)-once the picture is up...expect another 2-3 seconds for any sound-the same is true for changing channels, NO QUICK SCANNING, its takes about 7 second start to finish one channel to the next, after you enter the channel about 5 second before it turns, then another second or 2 before there is a picture, and yet another couple seconds before there is any sound.  **THIS SEEMS LIKE AN ETERNITY WHEN YOU ARE SWITCHING BETWEEN CHANNELS OR SURFING.-my other complaint is the volume control... there needs to be at least three more volume numbers between one and 5.  One is able to be heard easily from the next room.  TWO is already almost too loud if your the only activity in the house.  3,4, and 5 show very little fluctuation in sound, which I wish was the case for 0-3!", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV - Great Price", "Author": "H.

I looked at televisions in person -- again, to my \"untutored\" eyes they all looked pretty much the same to me except for one house brand at Best Buys which truly did have an inferior picture even to my non-discerning eyes.I haven't noticed any sound discrepancy but then I can't remember the last time I actually watched a commercial since I watch everything through TIVO and fast forward through all the crap.I also don't notice much of a time lag between changing channels and I think any delay is probably relating to a cable box since this changes at the exact speed as my prior set.It does take about 10 seconds to warm up but that's hardly a huge issue in my life and I don't know whether other LCD sets have the same start up rates.The set was quite a bit cheaper than an equivalent set bought elsewhere - free scheduled delivery - the guy did attach the stand and turn it on but it was up to me to set up the rest which was fine. Delivery from Best Buy was quoted at $75.Vizio seems to be relatively reliable and reliability is somewhat of a crapshoot anyway since my highly rated SONY only lasted 5 years. Given the price differential between this set and its competitors, I'm sure I will be fine with my amortized usage.It's 60 mz - After researching I determined that my viewing habits had no need for 120 since I don't watch sports.

Seemed like the only negative comments about the VIZIO was that it was slow coming on, and the volume changed becoming louder with need to lower the sound, or mute, then raise the sound volume back up. I liked the price of the VIZIO vs the LG, and decided to go with the VIZIO HDTV. It does take 15 to 20 seconds to come on, which I find acceptable. and initially the volume did fluctuate for about the first week, then there was no longer a problem with it.

The contrast between the volume of a program and the commercials is huge. Some reviewers say this doesn't bother them, but I don't like the fact that I have to constantly hold the remote while watching, otherwise, the commercial will blast through the house like you went from volume level 1 to 100 in one swoop. You have to either mute it or lower it significantly during commercials, then you have to raise the volume significantly to hear the progam dialog. But its not only a problem between program and commercials! During a progam, if music plays, it too will become ridiculously loud, so you again have to play with the remote, because once the music dies down, you will need to turn it up again to hear what people are saying...annoying! It did help a little when I turned the SRS trusound off completely. Its also true that it takes quite a while to turn the set on and quite a while to change a channel. Now, the speakers are not working at all. The TV was on for about 2 minutes and the speakers stopped. I thought I had accidentally muted it, but no. The picture is fine, but many TVS have a good picture these days. I don't feel that this is good for the price. This one is more along the lines of \"you get what you pay for\".  When looking online, I see Vizio Customer Service has a terrible reputation.

I thought I could get by because I wanted a cheaper set, but in the end, the niggles with this product caused me to have to give it back.  However, I'm pretty hard to please so many people might be perfectly ok with this set.I like the price, the relative brightness, the easy-to-use menus, and the remote.  Also the packaging of this TV is first-rate and it was a breeze to open, unpack, and set up.  VIZIO has a really strong focus on making things easy.What I didn't like was the quality of the picture or the sound.The picture is actually decent, and the colors are surprisingly accurate even out of the box, but adjustments are limited, the sharpness is not very good, and off-angle viewing is worse than even what you'd expect for an LCD.  Gamma was way off and not adjustable.Still, I might have lived with the picture if the sound weren't terrible.  And by terrible I mean terrible.  Maybe I had a defective unit, but I had to raise and lower the volume constantly as it never stayed at the same level, even accounting for variances in the programming. Sometime the sound seemed completely muffled, and even turning up the volume was not helping much.  And the output quality of the sound was abysmal.  In many scenes, even ones with a quiet background and clear dialog, I couldn't understand what was being said.  My home theater needs stereo audio RCA and this TV only has a digital optical out... so I didn't try with my HT.  The solution here is to get a digital-to-analog converter of course, but it wasn't worth it for this TV.Overall, I think this is a good effort and excellent value proposition, if you can deal with the issues above.

I decided to buy my first online television and found Amazon had the best deal.  The TV arrived and I loved it BUT after a few days the sound would go from one extreme to another on its own. Reminded me of the old Phillips commercial when they first came out with sound control so that every time you changed the channel the volume would stay the same. This TV is not like that!  Within the first week, the sound started skipping and the words would become jumbled and the only way to get rid of it was to change the channel. Needless to say I called Amazon and had a replacement sent out (within the 30 days). Replacement arrived and sound was still horrible but I thought I would just deal with it because it wasnt worth the effort and not to mention I started to believe maybe it was the cable/connection on my end.  After the 30 days passed the TV started skipping again!  Now I am stuck and cannot return it.

I'm tired of the tech people in Utah being rude so I'm doing something about it.November 21, 2012 update: This Vizio TV has improved 90% by my purchase of Componant cables as the vidio & audio carrier. It WOULD NOT allow a HDMI hookup. The component cables show a line going vertical up the screen but it's better than the TV constantly shutting off. Now, the other Vizio that I mentioned in the first rating is shutting off since it has an HDMI attached to it. I'll never buy VIZIO again.FYI: When we had a satelite service we had no problems.

AND IN SO MANY WORDS TOLD ME \"I WAS SCREWED\"...they would not be responsible because of the storm!....SO BEFORE ANYONE ELSE HAPPENS TO BE HONEST, TELLS THE TRUTH AND GET SREWED..........here I am writing my very first COMPLAINT TO ANYONE EVER.....hope it helps someone.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "horrible tv", "Author": "Mark Rouse", "ReviewID": "R2UHTG2P3J3Y5J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "just terrible. the sound is awful, tv turns off randomly, and the picture goes in and out constantly - all in the first 5 months! do yourself a favor and stay away from vizio.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "no improvement", "Author": "marc", "ReviewID": "RJVOLRA2MX022", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this set thinking on the brand name and the fact that I have purchased this brand before,having an excellent experience with the first set I purchased 4 years ago.I am somewhat dissapointed with the way this new set works,low quality sound,the remote control buttons are hard to control,the picture quality is not out the ordinary,if only I can find a set like the one I purchased from Vizio in 2007,I really do not know what are the technological advances in this new Tv set,I do not see them anywhere.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy a Vizio Product", "Author": "Thomas Eversole", "ReviewID": "ROL64IRK8C8LR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buyer Beware. Vizio company policies are misleading and dishonest. I bought from Vizio because the published specifications indicated a particular model VIZIO E420VA 42-Inch Full HD 1080p LCD HDTV, Black had certain inputs and outputs which were exactly what I needed (not just wanted). However, these specifications, given on their web site, in the Amazon link, and in the owner's manual (which I downloaded off the Internet before I bought), are wrong. When I called technical support to ask about this discrepancy I got the runaround. Evidently there are levels of support; Level 1 has only non-trained personnel reading from a script and who know nothing about the technical aspects of the televisions Vizio sells. Getting to Level 2, where the \"technicians\" know a little more, is very difficult and requires a very aggressive attitude. If there is a Level 3, it is not for us mere mortals.  When I inquired about how I would go about returning the set I bought, the Level 2 \"technician\" said that was beyond his authority, so he took my phone number and promised a manager/supervisor would call me back in five minutes. I waited for thirty minutes, then recalled technical support (starting again at Level 1). The new phone contact said he could do nothing either and demanded I give him the personal information Vizio required to register my purchase before a case number could be issued and a supervisor was able to contact me about my complaint. It was suggested that since the set was working a return would probably not be authorized. Evidently their lying about the features and specifications of their products is not sufficient reason to get a refund. I gave him the information and as of this writing more than twenty-four hours have passed and no one has called back.  I will never again by anything from Vizio. And I would caution anyone who is thinking about getting one of their products not to trust advertised claims and product descriptions. This company will do anything , say anything, and promise anything to get your money, which they will then hang on to with an unbreakable grip.  One other thing they do not tell you is that if you watch a non-HD channel through an HDMI input, there will be a very annoying and distracting thin band of white video noise across the top of the screen. You will never be able to know the limitations of Vizio products by looking at one of their sets in a retail setting. The closed circuit signal stores use to demonstrate the various models is deliberately designed to hype the good features and suppress the faults in Vizio products. Ignore completely what a salesman or company literature says - they are both lying. The only way you can be sure of what you are buying is to listen to someone who owns one. The one television manufacturer I have found to be honest with their customers is Samsung. Their products are more expensive, but that is for a good reason - they are worth it.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.99", "Features": "1080p Full HD\nSRS TruVolumeTM and SRS TruSurround HDTM audio for advanced virtual surround sound\n50,000 to 1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio\nAmbient Light Sensing technology\nUniversal Remote Control", "Name": "VIZIO E420VA 42-Inch Full HD 1080p LCD HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eTv2e424L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003DV55YO"}}
