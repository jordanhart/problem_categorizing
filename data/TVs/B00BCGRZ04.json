Not only was it loud enough but the tv has a setting in the sound menu called Clear Voice that emphasizes voice over sounds. This makes it much easier to understand what people are saying while on the treadmill. It also has a setting called Auto Volume that automatically adjusts the volume to the same level on all channels.  I am using the tv with a small roof top antenna and it gets all the stations from a 56 mile distance. I compared this tv's channel reception to my more expensive Toshiba Regza 46XV645U and they were both the same, so my worries of a cheap tv having an inferior tuner were over.  The base of the tv is not adjustable but was quite sturdy and level. The back has a 75mm by 75mm vesa mount so it could be mounted with something like this mount:Cheetah Mounts ALAMB Articulating Arm TV Wall Mount Bracket for VESA 100 12-24\" LCD LED Flat Screen Monitors Display/TVs up to 40lbs Includes Free 10' HDMI Cable and 6\" Bubble Level  I mounted this tv up high and used a feature in the picture menu called Samsung Magic Angle. This has settings to adjust the picture quality to compensate for the tv not being close to level line of sight. This brought the picture back to the same quality as if I were looking at it straight on. This feature could also be used if the tv were mounted real low.  The quality, picture, and sound of this tv were above my expectations for a tv at this price.  Update:After 1 year the tv is still going strong with no issues. I am very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV - Fits on kitchen counter under the upper cabinets", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2R57FWRX0DJY1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There aren't many major brand Flat Panel TVs that will fit under the upper cabinet in your kitchen. We have 2 other Samsung TV's in the house and are very happy with them.  It was a nice surprise to find this model for our kitchen.  Its also nice to have the same remote control design in 3 rooms.  The picture is great and the sound is pretty good for the small speakers facing down from the bottom edge.A year ago we bought a 22\" Visio for the kitchen.  It fit because it has no stand to increase its height.  The sound on the 22\" Vizio was poor . . often hard to understand speech on some programs with the Vizio.The TV is very light weight.  To allow the TV to turn on the granite counter, I removed the sticky rubber feet and put on felt pads available at hardware stores for chair feet. The felt pads are very slippery so you can spin the TV with a finger tip.Two Minor shortcomings for our needs:1. TV has only 1 HDMI input. Our primary program source is HDMI, but with Amazon-Prime and NetFlix subscriptions we also ordered a RoKu3 module to play Amazon/NetFlix programming to this TV. It would be nice not to have to use an external HDMI switch.  (We just discovered RoKu - its the competitor to the Apple TV module, but usually considered better than Apple TV unless most of your other gadgets are also Apple)2. This TV has an external power block like your notebook computer.  On our Peninsula kitchen counter, we turn this TV to face the Kitchen or Dinette. It would be nice to not have this power block to hide.  Being compulsive about tidy electronics installations, I lengthened the low voltage power wire on the power block and placed it in the unfinished basement below the TV. Now we only have the thin black low-voltage power wire going into a wall plate along with the HDMI feed from the basement. The DishTV and Roku remote controls are both Radio-Frequency so the DishTV HDMI-module and RokU-Module can be in the basement below the TV.Overall, we are really happy to find this great TV that is only 12.5\" tall with the stand.  If you really need 2 HDMI inputs and are OK with the higher price, look at the 19\" Toshiba TV Toshiba 19L4200U 19-Inch 720p 60Hz LED TV (Black)", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just average - I am keeping it, but there are pros and cons", "Author": "Cheryl L. Matthews", "ReviewID": "R2C14T4Z920S2G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First the cons.  The single most annoying feature of this TV is the base.  It is a cheap plastic base that does not fit properly.  It is wiggly even when fully tightened.  We had to jury rig it to get it to fit properly (snugly).  Even when tightened it leans down to the right (so the viewing from is not square, it is tilted) at a pretty noticeable angle of about an inch... To align it I propped the power cube that is part of the power cord under one end of the set and then it was even.  Should a customer have to go through this for a new product?  Definitely not.  If you intend to mount this TV on a wall or under a cabinet you will not have this problem and it is obvious that Samsung felt most would opt to do that hence not caring about the crappy fit of the base.  That being said, the base on the 19\" TV, crappy as it is, is superior to the base on the 22\" Samsung series 5003 TV which I returned because while that base was also plastic and flimsy (but fixable if you use your own properly fitted screws over the ones supplied in box), it also had the more serious problem of not being substantial enough to actually support the TV.  The 22\" 5003 series base was too small and the TV was top heavy and very tippable.  I can't believe the designs of these bases were actually approved by Samsung.Another con, the 19\" has only one HDMI port so know if you need to hook up several things you will need to buy a hub or splitter, sold separately (Amazon sells both).Also if you are planning to use this TV to receive over the air channels I was not able to find a way to manually add channels on this model.  I googled it too.  So unless there is something I am missing your over the air channels will be whatever is picked up by the TV scan only.  If you can receive most of be channels you want without adjusting your antenna then they should all be picked up on the TV scan, but if you need to adjust antenna to get certain channels it will be problematic as each scan will only pick up the channels the antenna picks up in that particular direction... And you can't manually add the channels not picked up on the scan.However, despite these issues,  I have decided to keep this TV.  I bought it for my kitchen.  If fits nicely under the upper cabinets with room to spare to sit it on cable box.  Base is small enough that it can sit on box without covering box's air vents.  Most of the smaller TVs leave something to be desired one way or the other.  The picture on the TV is excellent and it does have the traditional easy to navigate Samsung menus.  The 19\" size looks better In my smaller size kitchen where the 22\" still also fit under the cabinets but was a bit overpowering looking as I don't want the TV to be the focus of the room.  There are very few choices in a 19\" size.  So I am keeping it because of the picture quality, compact size and ease of use of the remote to navigate menus.  Once you correct the base issues and prop it on the power cube to get the picture frame straight it actually looks pretty nice.  Plus the smaller size allows it to fit farther back into the corner, leaving more counter space for me to use when cooking.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "About the stand - - -", "Author": "dinkleberry", "ReviewID": "R1Q1DQ4COFLQY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Simply put, Samsung has supplied the wrong size screws to attach the stand.  No matter how much you tighten them, there remains a gap between each screw head and the stand, causing unsafe, hazardous and frustrating wobbling of the TV all over the place.  The SIMPLE SOLUTION is to just insert a single metal washer onto each screw before inserting it into the underside of the base.  There will then be a firm and stable connection between the TV and its dedicated stand.  Samsung needs to own up to its error in supplying screws that are too long, and provide all purchasers with either three metal washers or the correct size (i.e., shorter) screws.  Also, because the screw holes are set so far into the bottom of the stand, it is advisable to use a magnetic screw driver to assist in getting the screws inside the holes.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent Small Television (Review of 19\")", "Author": "MechanicalMan", "ReviewID": "RUX6KGKDJS0R6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I calibrated a 19\" F4000 for my father yesterday with an X-Rite Colormunki Display colorimeter.

Samsung includes its \"Magic Angle\" feature to combat this, but that is just a band-aid. Furthermore, the chintzy stand does not tilt.- On/off contrast ratio measures about 900:1, so it's clearly not in the same league as larger LCD TVs with decent VA panels.- Like most LCD displays, dark shades are heavily blue tinged. And this TV is very blue up to 15+ IRE, which is quite bad, even by cheap LCD standards.- Color accuracy is not great; for example: some shades of orange and darker flesh tones are too green, and magenta is too blue.- The speakers aren't great (obviously).- This TV has limited connectivity with no audio outputs, aside from the headphone jack.FWIW, I own an older (2010) 22\" LG, and it is a significantly better TV than this Samsung. Contrast ratio is only slightly better on the LG, but its 10-point white balance controls and color management system allow for a better gamma curve and *far* better color accuracy than the F4000. Also, near-black has a more neutral color and its vertical viewing angles are significantly better (although still not good). Keep in mind, that is a discontinued model, and I have no idea how it compares to LG's current 22\" models -- it's likely that they're worse. Also, LG makes nothing smaller than a 22\", so it isn't an option if you want/need a 19\".", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fabulous", "Author": "Holly", "ReviewID": "R1KJL3V73HMARO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wonderful television.

Connect it to a power outlet and a cable jack. Power it up, and it goes into an interactive guided process for setting the various parameters, including scanning for available channels.After the plug-and-play process was complete, I tweaked a couple of the settings through the menu to satisfy my preferences for screen brightness and sound quality.

Bernardino \"Addicted to the Gold Box\"", "ReviewID": "R1BQZEKI0EUTIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this Samsung 19-inch HDTV yesterday via next day Saturday delivery. It was purchased to replace a small, older portable set in my sunroom, that of which I finally resolved to replace after much hesitation (my motto; if it ain't broke, don't fix it!). I had opted for a Samsung, as my kitchen set is also a Samsung (albeit a costlier 19-inch model HDTV), and I have been very pleased with the performance of that set. Additionally; I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab (tablet), for which there is a \"Peel\" Smart Remote app that allows one to control the channels and volume of any Samsung TV. It also provides detailed program information by category which is very nice to have at your fingertips!The set is very light and easy to set up; 3 screws in the bottom to attach the fixed base, and you're good to go...simply plug the cable into the rear of the set and plug the set into an outlet. Once you turn the TV on, programming instructions will appear; use the fast start guide as a reference. The set will auto-tune your cable provider's channels (I have Verizon FIOS), and you can either manually set the color, contrast, ratio, etc. or utilize the factory preset.As the base is not extendable, I would suggest eye-level placement (the TV has an interesting \"tilt\" feature to compensate for non-eye level placement); I have mine set up on an attractive pedestal (which is actually a plant stand!), and that provides an ideal platform for eye-level viewing.I do wish to add that this particular TV of mine is NOT connected to High Definition broadcasting (I already have 2 HDTV sets that I utilize a bit more often than this one, and am already paying Verizon enough for those set-top boxes and their monthly service in general:), so I maintain a basic \"box\".

Our cable co is going to boxes only - no more through the wall cable, only cable through boxes starting in February.  Got the boxes and decided I needed to replace mine (although they are great little TVs) with something that has HDMI ports.So, I am extremely pleased with the picture and the sound for these TVs.  Without the HDMI it was ok, but since the cable box has HDMI (and I guess they have gone to all HD now, as long as you have the cables - woo hoo!) I figured I'd do better using that, over the a/v cables, so I got a couple of the Amazon Basics HDMI cables (great cables - I use them all over my house!) and made myself a better hook up for both of these little TVs.  It's stunning.The TV's menu has a lot of picture, sound, etc, choices.  It seems like a really good little remote, so I'm kind of sad I have to use those big, clunky, Charter remotes.Fortunately, I read several reviews and one thing that seemed to be apparent was that attaching the stand could be problematic.  I did what one reviewer recommended and screwed the screws into the television first.  Then  I took them out and attached the stand, screwing it in.  Having done that it was pretty easy.  I did it on my own, without anybody else to help.  I've attached the stands for all the TVs in my house, so I was fairly familiar with the process.  I just lay the TV, face down, on a soft towel on my dining room table - with the bottom end at the edge of the table.  That makes it pretty easy to get the stand on.  Then I get one of the screws in about three quarters of the way so that I have stability and then do the rest, and tighten everything up.So, the reason I gave it only four stars is that the stand for this TV is slightly sub-standard.  The stands on my 15-inch Toshibas were way wider and more stable.  I'd be sure that this TV is not where kids or animals can access it because I feel like you could knock it over with a feather.

It did not look quite like the set pictured. The frame around the screen on the one I received is much thicker than the photo from Amazon. Picture is good, sound is very good and the remote responds great. We use this on a bracket in the kitchen. It sits on the supplied base which was not a problem to set up except Amazon forgot to send the screws to do so. Luckily I had some that worked perfectly. There was some wear on the face of the frame that made it clear that this was not a new TV. Some careful polishing with some compound paste brought it back to looking new.

Picture quality is good.  There are no buttons on the unit itself so everything must be done with the remote.  Not a big deal but everyone should be aware.  Also, the viewing angle is not great on this unit so if viewing at an off be aware the picture quality diminishes quite a bit.  Using in a bedroom so sound quality was not that important as most viewing is done with low volume anyway.  Sounds okay for a small 29-inch TV.

Kent McVety", "ReviewID": "R3PPH27RD1NVDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I run video in our church, and while we have expensive equipment, the monitor in the control booth is poor quality.  It is difficult to tell if the camera exposure is correct using this poor quality TV.  When I play recordings at home afterward, the picture looks different from when viewing it live.  I was looking for a TV to use as a monitor that would match the picture on my JVC professional CRT monitor.  I spent several hours adjusting the settings, and finally got a very close match to my professional monitor.  The factory settings look awful, so adjustments are necessary to get a really good picture.  Like other reviews, I found the stand to be flimsy, and difficult to get the screws tight enough.  By doing some hard turning of the screw driver, I was able to get the stand tightly fastened. The stand has a nice glossy finish, but is not as strong as the one on my older Samsung TV.  It seems that as the TVs become lighter in weight, the stands are also lighter.  Here are the settings I used.  They worked for me.  The TV was on a small table that was slightly lower than my line of sight.  My settings were based upon this angle..Mode:  StandardMagic Angle : Standing ModeBack Light : 20Contrast : 95Brightness : 52 (for component and HDMI, 65 for composite)Sharpness : 50Color : 40 (for component, 38 for HDMI, 44 for composite)Tint : (G/R)  G40/R60Dynamic Contract : OffBlack Tone : OffFlesh Tone : -2Color Space : NativeWhite Balance : No changeGamma : 0Motion Lighting : OffColor Tone : StandardSize: 4:3 (using TV for SD video)Digital Clean View : OffMPEG Noise Filter : AutoLED Clear Motion : OffHDMI Black Level : Normal (works only for adjusting HDMI mode)I found the Magic Angle to be a big help.

Was looking at the 32\" TVs but they all seem rather Large coming from my old 26\" TV. I finally saw the 29\" Samsung and tested it out at the store and it seemed the perfect picture and size for what I needed it for.I couldn't try my Consoles or my Gaming PC but luckily I had my Laptop with me and I was able to test it out via HDMI. Obviously you're not gonna get a 1080p picture quality out of this TV but at 1366x768 my games and movies looked pretty darn good.I finally received my new Samsung from Amazon and my PS3 and 360 both look great on this TV. I also tried my Blu-Ray player and the movies seemed to be way more vibrant then on my old Sony which is a huge plus for me.Suffice it to say, I'm quite happy with this purchase over all. It would of been cool to get a 1080p TV but since I had a size constraint I'm perfectly happy with what I got. Besides, at 28.5\" which is what the size actually is, 1366x768 is more then sufficient.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best choice where a TV this size makes sense", "Author": "J. Holman", "ReviewID": "R3F9V13H0206U4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's hard to find a small TV with decent picture quality, and this 19 inch Samsung is about as good as it gets in that respect. I bought it mainly to use while walking on my treadmill, where I'm looking at the screen from a couple of feet back. I'd actually have preferred a 15 or 16 inch TV for this purpose, and I also own a current model, 16 inch Viewsonic that I could have used. But the Samsung's picture is way better; the Viewsonic is washed out by comparison, and if you're not directly in front of the Viewsonic, it gets worse. This seems to be a problem with 15-16 inch TVs in general, based on other reviews on Amazon. Off axis viewing is better, if not ideal, on the 19 inch Samsung. So I can also watch it from across the room when I'm not on my treadmill, as long as the viewing angle isn't too extreme. (Side viewing is better than looking up at it, which makes the picture go dark -- so if you plan to mount the Samsung on wall, get a mount that's easy to tilt).I'm also pleased that the controls and user interface seem logical and straightforward -- though that could be because I own a couple of other Samsung TVs.The sound is about what you'd expect from a TV this size: acceptable, and certainly better than the 15-16 inch models deliver. But most of the time, I'm using the Samsung to watch something off my Roku box, with the sound connected from the Roku to an audio system. The Samsung also offers more in and outs than most small TVs, so there are a variety of connection possibilities.To sum things up: There are a lot of places where a TV this size is the ideal choice, and among the rather few offerings available, this Samsung stands out.On my wish list: I wouldn't have minded paying an extra $50 or so if Samsung had managed to include some \"Smart TV\" features, at least Netflix, Pandora, etc. But it appears Samsung doesn't offer these features on any TV smaller than 32 inches. That's a shame, because if you think about it, the places where you'd want a small TV (kitchens? bathrooms?) are probably the very places where you don't want several pieces of equipment and a tangle of cables. Even though the Roku interface is better than the comparatively sluggish \"Smart TV\" features on one of my larger Samsung sets, I'd have rather not had to dangle the extra cables off my treadmill to connect a Roku box. A smaller TV with Netflix -- and wifi -- would make perfect sense. Are you listening, Samsung?
