{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Got this for a steal @ 697.00 before Christmas!", "Author": "MIBPreacher", "ReviewID": "RYHT0TMGH7UKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the other review here about this TV and gaming about the cables and 60 vs 120hz settings.  I use monster 4k capable HDMI cables.  I have a PS3, a WiiU and an Xfinity HD-DVR.  I have seen 120Hz pop up on my notification bar some of the time.  My biggest fear was pixelation that I had read about.  So far it has barely happened and only during very high speed movement and then it disappeared.  Everyday TV and gaming has been great and Blurays are awesome.Amazon's delivery contractor was horrible but was free so I can't help but say stick to what amazon promises and don't sign till they do it and they take the box away.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality", "Author": "Steven", "ReviewID": "RBLM087H0RTAX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It took me a while to get the settings right but after I did, the picture quality was great. Perfect for movies and a living room.However, I've tried using different HDMI cables to get to 120Hz refresh rate and it would not go past 60Hz. I tried it on all three of my items, the Cable box, PS3, and the Xbox360. None worked. I would not have a problem with it if it didn't lag but it has been impossible to play video games on it so far.If you considering this TV for movies and shows, get it. I got a great price for it, that's why I'm not complaining. So I would recommend it considering the price, size and picture quality, but avoid it if you have any hopes of playing video games on it.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best \"dumb\" TV on the market", "Author": "A. Oertel \"Wood Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3BUJMHOP1MZQG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me say I started off looking at \"smart\" tv's and after nearly  pulling the trigger once or twice over the last year, I'm glad I waited and got this tv instead.  Since it does not have internet connectivity, it is not \"smart\".  Therefore, I'd call it the best dumb TV on the market. When I first started getting serious about a new tv and reading reviews, nearly every smart tv out there had comments like \"confusing UI\" or \"not intuitive\".  From what I gathered, while tv manufacturers may be good at hardware, the user interfaces are an afterthought at best for which you pay a lot of money. My neighbor bought a comparably sized \"smart\" tv, but he has had it since November and can't figure out how to stream anything.  So when I went looking for a tv without built in wireless connectivity, you don't find that many and you have to really _look_ for them.  Let me say that I am not a videophile.  I don't constantly fiddle with settings and I don't want to tweek my stuff to the 12th degree.  I just want to plug it in, turn it on, have it work and expect Leonard and Penny look like Leonard and Penny. This set does exactly that.  Mine is wall mounted and I hid the wires with a wide flat wire mold tray and it is perfect.  I previously had a 2001 Sony LED projection TV so this is a huge improvement.  It takes a little bit of getting used to watching the HD channels because it almost feels like you're watching a live action play, rather than a tv show.  If I want to stream netflix, I just plug in my chrome cast and we're ready to go.  The only reason I don't give it 5-stars is that occasionally I notice a little bit of pixalation which seems to come at the oddest time.  It's not like a fast cheetah running across the screen causes it, but is most noticeable when someone suddenly turns their head or moves their hand.  You'd almost think you are seeing things because it happens so fast.  After a while, my wife said \"Did you see that?\" so I knew on at least this one thing, I was not crazy.  I am 100% OK with this little oddity because it is overwhelmingly offset by the great picture quality and ease of setting up.  Am I happy I bought it?  Yes.  Am I happy I saved $700 over a comparably priced \"smart\" tv.  Absolutely.  Who's the smart one now?", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the Price", "Author": "EJ", "ReviewID": "R3JMPHUGO0PSGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded my living room TV from a 2010 model 40in Sony Bravia LCD 1080p. I love that TV. I wanted to get another Sony, but they don't make a 60in TV without all the internet capabilities. I have a PS3 and PS4, so I don't need all that extra internet. Sharp has always been a reputable brand in my opinion, as I have had 2 older CRT models back in the late 90s. I have also seen this TV advertised by Best Buy and it seemed to be the way to go.Installation: I am using a TV stand, so all I had to do was assemble the stand for the TV. This took about 3 minutes, and I just set the TV upside down on the couch and screwed in the stand. The TV is very light and two people can easily maneuver it. I was able to take it out of the box and place it on the couch by myself.Set-up: When I turned it on it immediately asked how I was using the TV, which I just have an antenna hooked up. It took about 2 minutes to scan for channels. I hooked my home theater up thru the HDMI, and everything was easy there. I popped in a Blu-ray and started messing with the settings. It only took me a few minutes to get it where I was used to. The only complaint is that I have to edit brightness between movie playback and video game playback.Use: The refresh rate is pretty cool. I've never had a TV like this. One of the first movies I watched was The Matrix. The TV handles the craziness of that movie just fine. I do notice the occasional pixelation, but it is never during the fast parts. It seems to blur when someone moves their head too quickly and the background is more stable, so it only affects a small area of the screen at once.Overall I think this TV was a great investment. It looks like I almost doubled my screen size, and the 120hz refresh rate makes gaming and Blu-ray a completely new experience. I do wish it had an optical out for my over the air audio, but the coaxial will work fine when I go buy that cable.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Look elsewhere.", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R3JIUYGCC1ETMJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Yeah, this TV is big and has a low price, but I would advise to avoid it. 1: There's a setting called DLC. I think it stands for Digital Light Correction. It completely blows out lighter skin tones. If you turn if off, it turns itself back on if you change inputs or turn the TV off. Sharp support says there is no way to correct this. 2: Dark images tend to have horrible  artifacting and fragmentation.While the TV has a decent picture otherwise, the above issues are total deal-breakers in my mind. Returned.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not even worth the low price!", "Author": "melissa", "ReviewID": "R1S4NHSGU3MIAQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is by far the owrst TV I have ever owned. I'm not even sure where to begin this thing is so bad. Right off the bat it took me about 2 hours to attempt to get the colors even close to ok on this thing. Almost any TV I've owned it takes maybe 5-10 minutes max to get just right. This thing is so anti-user friendly it is sick. Then I attempted to hook my sound bar. Oops, no Digital Optical out form this TV. (Hmmm thought that was becoming pretty standard.) Oh well, I get what I paid for. So I try to use the RCA digital out  Oh Wait, the book says you cannot, I repeat CANNOT use the digital out if you are using HDMI in. Hmmm. I couldn't believe this so I contacted Customer Service. After litterally spending over an hour on the phone with them. First problem was they couldn't find this model in their system(?!?!?) then they asked me to describe my remote control that came with this thing and they said I had the wrong remote control( after 15 minutes they said they were mistaken and I had the right one) Finally their Bright idea to fix the problem.....\"Use Analog connectors instead of HDMI and then I could use my Digital out\". What the heck?!?!? Funny cause when I returned this piece of garbage I got a VIZIO 60\" and it came with the Digital Optical out. Only about $100 more for the VIzio and it was plug and Play and came wiht WAY more features than this thing. So in conclusion Sharp Tech Support is laughable, this model was a an absolute nightmare to try to set up and even then it wasn't set up the way it should have been. I owned this thing for about 3 weeks and it was returned. DO NOT BUY THIS THINGS!!!!!!!", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Im happy with it", "Author": "D.

Its simple because I did not want any smart features on the tv.
