I was hesitant to order because there were no reviews on this item, however...it was the right size, the right price, and had everything I wanted, so I took a leap of faith and made the purchase. Set-up was easy and I get a clear, sharp picture and good sound. I'm even receiving more digital channels than I expected from my cable service! There is only one negative comment: When I tried to pull off the advertising sticker from the top left corner of the frame, it left a residue from the adhesive. Otherwise, this has been an excellent choice to complete my bedroom make-over. Oh...and thank you Amazon for the Free shipping offer and quick delivery!", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great HD Tv!!!!", "Author": "M. A.

You probably shouldn't pay attention to the two 1 star reviews here on this entry. The snow that was showing up  on your HD tv probably had to do with the reception of your cable or satellite as opposed to the tv itself, and as far as the picture quality, you need to tweek the controls a bit because I'm not having problems with mine. With the two 1 star reviews it looks like this isn't a good tv but believe me it's a high quality HD Tv.  Not that Sylvania is the best of all the brands of HD Tv's but for the low price that it sells for it's a terrific set. I'm not sure what the difference is between Sylvania's other 22 inch HD TVs but I'm sure that they're of similar quality and I've seen the reviews of them and they got a 4 and a 1/2 star rating average opposed to the 2 and a 1/2 star average on this one. Don't let the two bad reviews scare you off, this is a very fine quality set which I'm sure you will really enjoy.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Terrible color", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"marnop\"", "ReviewID": "RC5L1E47L8TYV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It sounded good from the one review so I ordered.The specs are good with many connections I need.However, the picture even at full brightness looked like there was a gray filter over it.I even looked for a sheet of film over the screen, but it was real.No of amount of adjustment of the picture would remove the shadows and bad colors.Everything else worked fine with input from satellite box and outside digital antenna.Nice sharp picture but at a 30 degree angle the picture was almost useless.There must be something wrong with only this box.I will be sending it back, thanks to Amazon's excellent return policy.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money.", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "RS6444H24ZW6S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sylvania LC225SSX 22-Inch Flat Panel LCD HDTV has an excellent HD picture. It's perfect for a small to medium sized bedroom, like a child's bedroom, or a small apartment. It sits easily on a dresser, cart or small table, yet its 22\" screen is wide enough for the picture to be seen well from a distance. It is extremely user friendly. It offers several different screen configurations for height and width. The sound quality is good, and there is an equalizer to allow you to change the bass and treble to your liking.

It worked a total of TEN MONTHS! I went through the litany of all the things to do to get it to work but it was completely dead.  I called the Syvania help line and they said all they would do is have me take or ship the TV to an \"authorized\" repair place which is 75 miles from where I live (my expense), pay for the labor (more expense) and they would happily pay for the parts.  When I complained that the labor and shipping charges could cost as much as the TV and the \"parts\" may only be a loose wire, the man at Sylvania got rude and basicly said that's the options- take it or leave it.  If you buy a TV from Sylvania, you are an idiot!  This TV sucked and the service at Sylvania sucks right along with their TV.  If I EVER buy another thing with the Sylvania name on it, I hope somebody takes me out and shoots me in the head!  They have lousy products and the service is lousy.Mad as hell in West Virginia", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "junk", "Author": "Eugene D.

I was not interested in investing heavily in my bedroom set. I can only say that video differences between the Sylvania and the cream of class Samsung (at a much higher price, which I A/B'd in the store) are minor if you are using an HDMI or HD source. Sharpness is excellent, color is natural and well-balanced with factory settings, sound is what you'd expect out of teeny speakers but stereo separation, a key factor in a small set, is excellent. Menus are intuitive and there are lots of useful presets and user tweakable sound and video adjustments, though you won't need them much. Off axis image quality drops off dramatically which is to be expected for a sub-$200 device, but is unimportant for a bedside TV. My main system is a 52\" Sony SXRD 1020P which is a state of the art picture, and I can only say that I never find myself disappointed by compariosn when I watch a familiar movie on the Sylvania. I would not recommend this set if you are A. going to use component video inputs (the sharpness decreases dramatically) or B. going to use it as a main set in a large room. The remote is well laid out. I've owned mine for a year and a half and had now problems. Highly recommended for the discriminating viewer on a budget. The only improvement I would suggest is a sound levelling feature, since films with a lot of dynamic range (like Batman, etc) can require some volume riding if you're watching them late at night and have neighbors. If you adjust for reasonable sound levels during explosion scenes you'll find dialogue too low.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Very Good Buy!!!!", "Author": "Alexandros M.
