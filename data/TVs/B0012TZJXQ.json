Jackson", "ReviewID": "R3LWBPBRHDNQAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read many reviews some positive and some negative, I went with the positive ones and my own experiences with other Sharp products.  I have had a Sharp Aquos LD37D44U 37-Inch LCD HDTV for about a month and must say that I am very pleased with it so far.The picture quality is very good and it has every connection that you may want on the back.  I am using the HDMI connection from a HDTV Verizon FIOS Box.I have no problems with any lines or dead pixels as some have written about.  If you are looking to buy a solid TV and not over pay for a name, then consider buying one of the Sharp Aquos LCD TVs.", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "good for the price", "Author": "B.

It worked fine until last week. When I attempted to turn it on the power light blinked off and on. Took it into repair shop.

It does hesitate before bringing up the HD picture and I don't know if that's due to the TV or Comcast. Delivery and set-up was excellent.

Daddy", "ReviewID": "REK7CMFDJSKFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We wanted a flat screen HDTV to fit in our armoire.  It was either this set or a high end 32\".  We went with size (this 37\") over higher quality.  My feeling was that since this would be our first HDTV, it was going to be an upgrade no matter what.  And I'm really happy with the purchase.  I can't complain at all - seems like a great set to me.  I think the hi-def is really impressive - it's crisp and the colors look vibrant and natural to me both on HD broadcasts and blu-ray.  Most of the stuff we watch is 1080i which looks great and seems to be a lot better than the 720p stuff (thought I read somewhere that 1080i didn't look so good on this set but it looks great to me).  My only gripe is there's no headphone jack but if you've got a receiver, that won't be an issue for you.", "Date": "July 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Rob", "Author": "Robert E.

The Sharp LC37D44U was the only 37-inch set that we found that would fit, and it touches the sides of the cabinet on both sides. There really aren't many 37 inch sets to choose from....lots of 32 inch, 40 inch, and 42 inch, but not many 37 inch. The tv set arrived in perfect condition, it set up easily and quickly, and the picture quality is great. I use a surround sound system, so I can't really comment on the TV sound. I just turn it off.Negatives:I'm not very happy with the instructions that came with it....just one big sheet of paper, printed on both sides, that folds and folds and folds. I would much prefer a booklet. Also, because I have several audio and video components there are not quite enough input/output terminals. But with a little ingenuity you can get everything connected.I would recommend it based on picture quality and ease of setup.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "good tv for the price", "Author": "eEraser", "ReviewID": "R36FIZRPALVBF2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture is good and the sound is good.

Box was pristine. Called Sharp and they wanted to perform service on it.  Not happy about a $700 display with zero hours needing service.

Packing is poor - when I opened the box and saw the POOR amount of styrofoam I got worried.  Thanks to Sharp, my worries were confirmed.  It wouldn't even power up.  The manual is poor.  I waited on hold forever (20 minutes) to reach a CSR who after doing the same things I had done, transferred me to dispatch (for a CSR) where I waited on hold for another 10 minutes.  Then when a new CSR picked up, verified my case # and name, had to get someone else!  Boy these guys sure love the hold button!!!!.  They 'might' be able to come out and check it in 2 weeks.  I was also put on hold by \"Dispatch\".  Customer Services is HORRIBLE.  At this point I really think I will just return it and pay the shipping myself to be rid of it.  I will NEVER buy a Sharp product again.  I give it one star because there is no ZERO star option.

The first one would not power on. The green power light just kept flashing. So I returned it and ordered another. The second one came with dark spots on the screen that will not go away.
