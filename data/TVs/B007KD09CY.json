Did A LOT of online and in store research looking for a 32\"-40\" LED TV.Looked at Vizio, Samsung, Sony, LG in addition to Panasonic.After a month - I'm very satisfied with my selection.If you have read the reviews on this model here on Amazon you will see overall very good comments.Have seen some silly complaints about short power cord, and have seen some about the wifi adapter(I'm using ethernet cable). And some average comments on the sound, but the major points of the TV are Great.There is one reviewer (C Reach) who claims to have gotten video settings online - THIS IS TOTAL BS. I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED - Does Not Exist.Below you will find a Pros and Cons list and my picture and sound settings. My settings were done using my eyes and ears no calibration equipment.Everyone's taste and environment are different, so these are what look good on mine. I will eventually test further with my calibration discs, but for those looking foe a good starting point from which to fine tune - this should help.PROS:Non Gloss screen reduces glareAmazing viewing anglesGood overall contrast and color qualityLow power consumptionSmart (Flat) input layout on backGood assortment of connections*  (*Component video needs to use the included adapter - no biggie)Price / Performance Ratio is BEST in ClassDNLA and Internet FeaturesBuild QualityNo Spotlighting from corners like the Samsung sets (That was a dealbreaker for me)Easy SetupCONS:Sound could be better - Sure, but is equal to or better than most in this classCould have more extensive picture adjustment settings, but has enough to obtain a quality picture.Remote should be Illuminated and have a dedicated Sleep button. (Many people will use this for a bedroom TV)Some complained about power cord being short - But I had no problem with this at all. (It is detachable)OVERALL I Give it a 8.8 out of 10.MY SETTINGS:Were set by eye averaging several different chanels and subject matter in a room with no light other than the TV.You will probably want to fine tune based on taste and environment. Keep in mind this was done without calibration software, but I'm in the industry and have color experience.

However...On page 63 of the manual, it says \"The TV's internal software was designed to work with Panasonic's wireless adapter model DY-WL10.\" After trying three non-Panasonic wireless adapters just to see if they would work (they wouldn't), I purchased the Panasonic adapter, but, as the other reviewer discovered, the TV would not recognize the DY-WL10. Panasonic's Netconnect site covers only 2011 television models--nothing about 2012 models.When I called Panasonic Support today, I was told that, no, the DY-WL10 isn't compatible with any of the 2012 Panasonic models. The model that the support rep recommended is the DY-WL5, which isn't available yet; I can't find it on Amazon, or even on Panasonic's own site. B&H; Photo lists it for pre-order with a March 31st availability date. So, at least until that date, this TV cannot use a wireless connection.Backup plan: I used a powerline ethernet adapter to connect the TV to my router. The TV recognized it easily, and it works fine in my house. But, as with all powerline products, your house's wiring must be pretty good for it to work well enough for video transfer.[Edit 03/08/2012] As a commenter pointed out, the appropriate wireless adapter for this TV (and I assume all 2012 Panasonic WiFi-ready models) is the DY-WL20, not the DY-WL5. Of course, I can't find that model for sale either as of this moment.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exceeded expectations.", "Author": "C. Reach", "ReviewID": "R1Z37CO6ZWBZYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really great tv. Perfect size for my office/studio. Picture quality is excellent. I calibrated the tv using settings I found with a quick google search. Sound is ok, but as with most flat screens it lacks a really impressive on board audio set up. Xbox 360 games look incredible. I've been playing Skyrim and Battlefield 3 and am blown away by the picture.  I fired up amazon prime (through Viera Cast) and watched Troll Hunter in HD. Again, beautiful picture (and awesome low budget Norweigian movie).And now a more niche consideration. I am an illustrator by trade and use a Wacom tablet and photoshop in my day to day work.  I purchased this tv with the intention of utilizing it as a third, large scale monitor for certain projects. A big reason I went for this particular tv is the LED screen. I find it is much easier on my eyes when I am painting on screen for hours on end.So there you have it. Beautiful image quality, a decent service lineup (Netflix, Prime, etc.), customization,  great aesthetics,  light weight, and it won't make your eyes bleed when you are painting an event poster at 2 in the morning.And yes, it says wi-fi ready but it needs an adapter. Otherwise it would say built in wi-fi. so the option is either buy a tv with built in (an extra $200-$2000) or buy an adapter ($60.. I agree it's a rip off. I ran a wire.). Same reason the E3 model had only 4 stars, from what I read in the reviews.  So if you can get past that, this is a really excellent buy.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Picture Looks Washed Out", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R3H6L5O8HJ3H72", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After spending several days looking at different TV's, we decided on this 42\" Panasonic LED LCD.  I am an electrical engineer and I understand the difference between an traditional LCD and an LED LCD.  I liked the lower power usage and light weight of this TV.  I have also had a Panasonic TV (tube type) for over 15 years and it still looks great. Consequently, I had a high degree of confidence with Panasonic.  Unfortunately, the picture on this TV seems washed out.  The darkest dark value is really grey.  I tried changing the settings as much as possible and it never really made a difference that was acceptable.  Also, I found we were pegging out the operating variables such as backlight, contrast, brightness, and others in trying to improve the picture.  I tried many different combinations and we just could not improve the sense that the picture was washed out.  Also, I have to wonder whether a TV is worth buying if you have to do so much adjustment to its default settings to get an acceptable picture.  Unfortunately, this TV is going back to Amazon.  I am glad we purchased it from Amazon directly so we got the 30 day return guarantee.  We will return it immediately.Update:  We bought an LG 47\" LED LCD TV after we returned this one.  Beyond the fact that it is bigger than this TV, one thing to note is that the picture was much better--no washed out look to it.  This was with the default settings, not after extensive adjustments as was needed with the Panasonic TV.  We are very happy with the LG at this point.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Couldn's has asked for anything better!!!", "Author": "Ray \"RR\"", "ReviewID": "R8O44PAJP3HPA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was initially inclined to buy a last year model tv, luckily I lag the TV purchasing process and came accross this puppy.It had the key features I wanted: LED, 1080p, and the viewing angle, and most importantly to have the right dimensions as it was going to be mounted on the wall.I was initially bummed out that  it was \"wi-fi ready\" rather than \"build-in wi-fi\", nevertheless, that issue was easily solve as I boughta thePanasonic DMP-BDT320 blu ray player that has \"build in WIFI.\"The TV performs superb with the blu ray player and image is AMAZING! I havent even touch the color setting thus i know i am not getting the full deal yet.I will be buying the 37\" model in the near future for family.Do me a favor, just buy the damn TV you wont regret it.{AUDIO ISSUE that exist \"supposely\"(EDIT)}AUDIO IN: Some of the reviews are innacurate about the RCA jacks. There is no direct RCA jack on the TV, HOWEVER, the TV comes with a special cable that once you plug it to the special jack it has, you will NOW have composite or RCA connections.This connection is for VIDEO/AUDIO in from another device.AUDIO OUT: The TV does have a Digital Audio Out. If you want to hook  up an older stero or other decive with Red/White RCA cable, you need to buy a \"Digital Coax & Optical Toslink to R/L Stereo Audio Converter\" which @ the low end should run you about mid $20, check the monoprice website (i buy all my video/audio needs from them).", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost returned it!

In fact we have had to repair only one product - a microwave made in 1997.  The \"Add 30 Seconds\" key became loose after 14 years of abuse!I bought this TV to use as a monitor.  At first I could not figure out how to solve the overscan problem (the edges of the picture are cut off, so the TV displays only a part of the picture).  So I almost returned it.  The solution is very simple.  Menu --- Picture --- Aspect Adjustments --- HD Size.  The default is size 1.

There is a competing product from Samsung.  Do yourself a favor and buy this TV or some other Japanese brand.The TV enhances blue and green color.  I am watching an anime called Squid Girl.  There is a lot of blue color.  It looks really good on this TV.The panel is made in Japan.  The TV is assembled in Mexico.Colors are natural and accurate.  Viewing angle is almost 180 degrees, as advertised.  There is no ghosting when playing games.There are only two cons, (1) no RCA audio out.  The only audio output is toslink.  I have to use a toslink-RCA converter.  Now the sound is coming out from a Sony SRS-DB500 2.1 speaker system.

It's not connected to a cable box, so maybe there is a difference.)I'm a channel flipper so this was a concern.I connected the TV to the Internet via the Ethernet port, not wireless.. for me it was easy to just move my cable modem and wireless router near the TV. I've been through the \"which wireless adapter will work\" game with Tivo and didn't want to be doing that again, plus wanted to make sure streaming would be fine.So far, streaming from Netflix has been perfect.The Amazon site doesn't label the TV \"Smart\", but the Panasonic site does. I guess it depends on how you define Smart, but this TV can not browse the Internet or download apps, it can only access the five pre-programmed streaming services. Not a big deal to me though, I was just slightly misled.I was pleasantly surprised, when I clicked the Viera Tools and the DLNA option, it magically found my computer and I was able to play music and play a picture slideshow from the data on my computer. Kind of neat, not sure if I'll ever use it or not.Speaking of sound, I thought the sound from the TV speakers was pretty weak. From other reviews, I set Treble -10 and Bass +10 and that helps, but it's still not very good. I'm planning to add some speakers soon, probably the Panasonic speaker bar and wireless subwoofer when the latest one comes out.Overall I'm happy with the TV, awesome picture, the TV is beautiful, and it has a lot of features.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture, lacks analog audio output", "Author": "Gary F. \"Garfy2008\"", "ReviewID": "R2ICP95V2XYYNM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like most flatscreen TVs today, the only thing I didn't like about this TV is that it didn't have analog audio outputs (RCA jacks). It does allow for analog audio and video input using a proprietary cable that plugs into their own jack. So I had to get a digital-to-analog converter so I could feed the audio to my stereo receiver. The picture is great just like my older 32\" Viera I bought for my living room. The internet connection works without having to use Panasonic's own wireless adapter. What I did was use a Netgear wireless adapter that plugs into the wired LAN port of the TV (the TV won't know the difference that it's actually connected to a wireless adapter since it's coming into the wired LAN port). Now, according to most other reviewers, a wireless adapter connected to the USB port won't work so you need to make sure you get one that connects to the LAN port, not the USB port.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice TV for the price", "Author": "katmax", "ReviewID": "RXAXE105K4ZDS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this TV as a bedroom set, for cable/DVD use, and for that purpose it is a nice buy (Amazon prime, no sales tax, free shipping, made it a good buy for us). However, one caveat, when we bought this in April, Amazon listed the specs as a 120 HZ flatscreen, we bought it based on this information, now the same set is listed as only 60 HZ, which is obviously a lesser quality product. This was a replacement for our much more expensive Sony Bravia, which developed terminal picture problems after only 3 years that rendered it unwatchable (FYI, another relative's Bravia is now doing the same thing, as is a good friend's, don't buy Bravias, or at least get long extended warranties for Bravia's, they don't last!!!) The default picture settings on this set are pretty gaudy, definitely need to make adjustments, we found configurations that now give it a much better picture than the default settings. I've seen other reviewers make recommendations for picture settings, I want to offer my choices, this combination of settings gives a darker, better contrast, with a more lifelike saturation to the color, along with a good sharp picture:  PICTURE MODE: VIVID  BACKLIGHT: +100  CONTRAST: +92  BRIGHTNESS: +22  COLOR: +33  TINT: 0  SHARPNESS: +20  COLOR TEMP: NORMAL  COLOR MGMT: ON  A I PICTURE: ON  CATS: OFF  VIDEO NR: AUTO", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty good TV", "Author": "retiresoon", "ReviewID": "R27XPTXG34KTHJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am just a few days into using my 37\" Panasonic, but will give first impressions.  I especially like the picture quality.  With some small adjustments for personal preferences, the colors are life like, rich, and sharp.  I do some graphics work and may use this for a computer monitor at some time, which is a plus.  Set up was easy and good documentation.  I think the compact design is slightly smaller than other 37 inchers I was considering which is good for my small TV space.  The Enerstar tag gives this an approximate annual operating cost of $9., which seems pretty amazing.Like others have mentioned, if you want to use wireless for internet movies you will need the adapter that costs $60 or so, or some other device.  It is slightly misleading in the way this is promoted in the product description.  The sound is thin to say the least.  The only sound out terminal is an optical out, which nixes using my old home stereo system like I had done with my previous set using RCA outs.  I've started looking for a simple relatively inexpensive sound bar that will use the single cord optical sound connection, but have not found anything yet.  So it looks like I'm stuck with the sound quality until I learn more.Compared to my old Toshiba that died after five years, the screen is sort of mat finish, but slightly more glossy and picks up more distracting room reflections.  Probably not a huge deal, but slightly different from my old TV. I suppose reliability is sort of a spin of the dice, but after having my last TV go south after five years I tried to find a brand with a low rate of repair and based on Consumer Reports and other reviews, Panasonic looked to me like it was among the more reliable brands.  I might have gone Samsung, otherwise.I'm not the most technically savvy person and may learn more later, but that's where I'm at now.  There are a number of features I will probably never use.  A nice TV for the money that could have been a great TV with better sound options and slightly less screen gloss.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Needs better audio out options!!!", "Author": "Jvvolf1", "ReviewID": "R2HVV8AD3G40IO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Only one audio out (let me say that again) ONLY ONE AUDIO OUT AND ITS OPTICAL !

There is however the typical IPS \"glow\" which is inherent on all IPS screens without special polarizers. I sit about 30\" away from the screen, and it is hardely noticable unless I turn the lights in the room off, and a completely black screen is displayed. That is good. I would like to see a more uniform \"glow\", since there is none from the left while sitting straight on, only the right. This seems typical of modern IPS LED based screens, so just be aware it is present.Colors out of the box are HDTV colors, which means crap. I was able to get decent colors after lots of tweaking, and creating a specific profile in windows. Close enough for gaming, movies, and web browsing anyway. There is some light banding, but only noticable on test screens so far. A professional calibration with a hrdware sensor would probably solve the banding, but it is not of a concern to me.The TV is bright, rediculously bright if you want it to be. Since I sit in a dark room, 30\" from the screen, I have the backlight down to zero, and brightness about half way. This probaby puts it around 100 cd/m2, which is my comfort zone. It also allows for extremely low black point and excellent contrast.HD content is emaculate, as expected. SD from my PS2 is very good, SD over the air, not so good. The aspect controls leave much to be desired, there is no 1:1 pixel mapping for SD content or other than 1080p resolution. The proper setting for your 1080p desktop is Full/HD size2.No 4:4:4 chroma mapping that I can find, not a big deal to me, I can deal with the occasional blocky/blurry test on the web.Response is typical of a modern 60hz display, nothing unusual here. Input lag is unperceptable in any mode on any label for me, but I am coming from a display with ~20ms of lag.This is a glossy screen, be aware.The bezel has a clear acrylic surround, which does not show up in the photos, making it a larger bezel overall than it appears in the stock photos. No big deal for me.The component and composite hook up is by way of a breakout cable, only one at a time, fine for my one SD source that is the PS2. 4 HDMI ports are more than enough for me.I use a reciever for audio, but this units audio is low compared to most other sets I have heard. Audio quality seems typical, with all the bells and whistles, I just can't comment on overall quality since all modern HDTV's audio are crap.Have not tested any of the networking functionality or streaming capability, that's what my PC is for.Overall and excellent PC monitor for entertainment purposes, provided you are not a novice. Color is tunable to an extent ( more in the service menu), blacks are excellent, low or no input lag, sufficient response time, and uniform panel/ backlight (on my unit). A worthy succesor to my old high end screen.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Impressions", "Author": "Veritas", "ReviewID": "RLO6IJOAVMFSO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV 1 week ago to replace a very good TCL 32-in LCD-TV (purchased 2 yrs ago) that simply was undersized for my living room and thought I would provide some initial impressions.My setup:- OTA antenna connected directly to the TV- Windows 7 computer directly connected to the TV- Bluray player connected via HDMI to the TV- Old-school DVD player connected via component to the TV (not used regularly)- Ethernet cable connected to the TVI don't have a receiver or surround sound speakers connected, and do not have a satellite/cable connection.EXTERNAL APPEARANCEComing from an older-generation TCL (not the newer ones, which sport a thin frame), the Panasonic looks stylish and outwardly quite sleek. There is no glowing logo on the front, but the two-toned bezel, with a glossy 1 in black border surrounded by an even thinner clear border, gives this TV a very high-end look that belies the price. Of course, design is in the eye of the beholder, but I find the look to be refined and svelte. The side profile reveals how un-American this TV is in terms of thinness - only 1.5 in thick or so. Stand is nice, and overall the 42-in TV has a relatively small footprint and fit nicely into the space that once was occupied by my 32-in TV.INPUTSYou can read Amazon's included technical specifications regarding inputs, but in a nutshell, this TV has 4 HDMI, 1 digital audio out (Toslink, I believe), 1 VGA computer connector, 2 USB ports, 1 SD card slot, an Ethernet port, and this funky multifunctional component/composite port that requires the provided adapter cable to use (cannot use both component and composite simultaneously). Of note, there is NO 3.5 mm headphone jack included.INTERNET CAPABILITIESAs clearly stated in the included info, this TV is NOT a wireless TV - you must connect it via Ethernet cable to your router, or buy an overpriced USB dongle to enable wireless connectivity. There is also some confusion in certain reviews regarding the extent of internet capabilities, which I will demystify here. The only apps on this TV are Netflix, Amazon Prime, Cinema Now, Hulu Plus, and Vudu. Youtube, Pandora, etc are not included. You can connect to a DLNA-enabled server, and can also use your iOS or Android smartphone as a remote by downloading the appropriate app, which I have tried. Suffice it to say that while it is pretty damn cool to be able to control your TV with your phone, the interfaces are somewhat clunky with lag and do not properly harness the power of your phone (full keyboard, multitouch, anyone?).PICTURE QUALITYThis is what you most likely bought the TV for, right? I'll address each mode of connectivity in turn here.1) OTA broadcasts -I live in the Dallas area and pick up a lot of OTA channels, many of which are in HD (Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC, PBS, myTV, TXA 21, CW, several Spanish language channels, ion TV, etc.). Picture quality from these broadcasts is generally stellar, although there is some channel variability, which I think is more related to their feed rather than the TV itself. There is no noticeable motion blur, but I have yet to watch any significant sports programming (NFL football today).2) Computer input -This is where I do the bulk of my viewing, to be honest, especially since I don't have cable or satellite. I find it much easier to navigate Netflix and Hulu, as well as watch other videos, through my computer with a wireless keyboard than through the TV. I am currently connected to the TV through a VGA cable at 1366x768. On light backgrounds, there is noticeable horizontal flickering if you pay close attention; if you are engrossed in what you are reading, this will likely not be a problem, but is noticeable nonetheless. Also, at full screen resolution, Hulu does have some jarring motion blurring when the camera is panning rapidly. This may be a function of the refresh rate - folks with a 120 Hz TV can chime in with their impressions. Overall, some minor flickering and motion blurring on Hulu aside, I have enjoyed using this TV as a computer monitor.3) Bluray - I don't watch many movies through Bluray, but quality seems up to par with good colors and sharpness.4) Netflix, Vudu -Netflix reigns supreme in my house, and picture quality is excellent. The interface leaves much to be desired, especially compared to a computer interface, and this is where one's phone could come in handy if the manufacturers actually choose create a better user experience. In terms of Vudu, I rented a movie on Vudu a few days back, and in HD (not even HDX), the quality was terrific with no blockiness or fuzziness. Interface is decent, and you can watch trailers directly from the app. I haven't spent much time with Amazon prime or Hulu plus, as I don't subscribe to these services.5) SD card/USB -I haven't watched any videos through these inputs.I couldn't resist making a pros and cons list pertaining to image quality.Pros:- terrific HD picture resolution with good color output and contrast- solid computer monitor with minimal drawbacks- excellent Netflix and Vudu quality- LED \"bleeding\" is not really problematicCons:- more reflective than I thought - I would call the screen semi-glossy, as it is not like the mirrors that are some plasmas, but is also not a matte finish like some LCDs. May need to shut some of the blinds on a bright day, especially if you are watching something dark- viewing angles are not 178 degrees - there is definite degradation in brightness at more extreme viewing angles- minor flickering and some motion blur when in PC modeSOUND QUALITYB&W; or Bose quality speakers these are not, but they are more than adequate for typical viewing. I keep the volume in the 40s routinely and am able to comfortably here the TV. At higher volumes, it definitely becomes too loud for my taste. I think the surround sound mode only makes the sound more tinny and phone-like, but the base enhancing mode does its job. I wish the TV did include a 3.5 mm headphone output, however, as no TV speaker that I have encountered can match the prowess of some cheap computer speakers.RESPONSIVENESSTo answer Vince Vaughn's famous question as he talked about motorboating Jane Seymour's breasts in The Wedding Crashers, this TV is built for both speed and comfort. Changing channels OTA is very fast, especially compared to my previous TV. There is minimal input lag, and the internet apps power up fairly fast, although Netflix always starts with this annoying splashscreen offering a choice between \"full\" Netflix and Netflix for kids.REMOTEThe remote is fairly well-laid out, but there is no illuminated backlight, something that more TVs at this price point really ought to start including. There is a dedicated Internet input, but there are no configurable buttons to go directly to a certain input. There are also basic rewind/fast forward/play/pause functions included at the bottom, which work well with some of the internet apps. Unfortunately, the INFO button does not provide very much program information, and I have yet to figure out how to find a basic electronic programming guide that tells me what is coming up in the next few hours, something that my basic TCL included two years ago.Overall, I am very pleased thus far, and am giving the TV 4 stars due to the limitations delineated above. The reflectiveness was surprising given that this is an LCD TV, as was the lack of an electronic programming guide. But the picture quality, design, responsiveness, basic internet apps, and robust connectivity (despite no headphone input) have kept me happy thus far.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Limited web features", "Author": "indy jay", "ReviewID": "R1BLLA7S0VMGH4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice picture, easy set up, overall a great TV but overpriced considering that some features have been quietly removed.

A Flat Screen That Fits the Entertainment Center!", "Author": "GT Rider \"AP\"", "ReviewID": "R39ONY5EMK2CUF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been pursuing a flat screen television since the FCC announced the requirement for broadcasters switch from analog, standard definition transmissions to digital, high definition.  Of course, the bigger the better except...I was told in no uncertain terms that whatever I bought to replace the CRT in the entertainment center had to fit in the same area of the entertainment center.As an engineer, I was able to use rusty math skills to determine the largest high definition screen in the 16:9 aspect ratio that would fit in the entertainment center would be 37\" diagonal.  And that size is fairly scarce in the flat screen market.  Therefore, on size alone, this TV is a winner for me.Now for the technical evaluation, the likes and dislikes:Likes - It fits!  It fits!  It fits!The color is superb.  I have worked in the display industry for 12 years, so it is always a pleasant surprise to be given a product that needs little tweaking of any of its color profiles.  This is one of those products.There are enough inputs to account for just about any conceivable video input device... provided you like using HDMI.  Fortunately, HDMI has become the home video input standard in the past few years in spite of its shortcomings.  I was a little sad not to find an S-Video input since they have a composite video adapter.  It wouldn't have been that difficult to split the adapter cable to include S-Video.The iPad as a remote control is a remote control saver.  I don't know how, but remote controls have a nasty tendency to die in my house.  Using the Viera Remote application on the iPad is keeping the remote for this TV looking like new.  The only complaint I have about this software is that it can't be used to power the TV on or off.  Perhaps Panasonic might consider keeping the Ethernet port active when the TV is in standby (powered off) mode so that an incoming power request can toggle the power state.  That wouldn't be difficult at all to do since this TV uses the same command to power the TV on and off if my tests with the universal remote feature of the satellite receiver is any indication.  A firmware update and a patch for the software and the Viera Remote app or any home control system can completely replace the remote control provided with the TV.Dislikes - The control buttons for this TV are located on the back of the TV.  Not on the side, not near the side, but well into the back of the TV so that if I try to use them, I have to turn the TV in order to reach them.  Why is this an issue when the TV comes with its own remote control?  In my house, remotes die at an alarming rate - batteries leak, hand lotion gums up button contacts, Buffalo hot wing sauce corrodes button contacts, dogs use them as chew toys - you get the idea.  I would suggest to Panasonic to put the buttons on the side of the bezel, or on the bottom of the bezel where they are easy to reach.The audio just isn't up to par.  Sure, it has plenty of volume in my tiny house, but it is still pretty weak.  I can understand why others complain about this feature.  The speakers face the back instead of the front, where the viewer is located.  Dolby Surround for the internal speakers is wasted on these inferior speakers.  There is almost no bass response in these speakers as well.  Theatrical experiences should not be expected from these speakers.  If I had a receiver that accepted digital audio (TOSLink), I would use that instead of the internal speakers of this TV.Overall, I like this TV because in spite of it being built to an intermediate size.  Careful thought went into the video processor circuits to yield a crisp HDTV picture with excellent color.  The LCD shutters are fast switching so no jaggies or judder when watching HD content, in spite of only 60 Hz refresh rate.  It could be improved by relocating buttons to a more convenient to access location on the TV, better audio processing and speakers and a minor change to the Ethernet port and TV firmware to allow the Viera Remote application to completely replace the TV remote control.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Life-like", "Author": "Money Leaker", "ReviewID": "R1TUDP8YMPE5XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The image quality on the 37\" unit that I bought is gorgeous.

In fact, when my fiancee and I checked out this model in the store *right next to a Samsung*, it was actually clearer than the Samsung, which surprised us both. (We have a Samsung 32\", which we love, so it's not like we have anything against that brand.)We're using using this TV with a Panasonic Blu-Ray player and Panasonic soundbar, and all of the components work well together. For instance, when I turn on the TV, the soundbar automatically turns on. When I turn on the blu-ray player, the TV and soundbar both turn on. Likewise, when I've been watching a DVD and I turn the Blu-Ray player off, everything powers down together.My fiancee and I are cord cutters, meaning we don't have cable. Instead, we use Amazon Prime streaming, Netflix streaming, and Hulu plus. This TV actually supports ALL THREE via its native interface. We have it hooked up to the Internet via an Ethernet cable (NOT wifi), and the interface and performance of all three services are faster than any other streaming devices we've tried (and that includes our Roku and our Panasonic wifi-enabled Blu-Ray player, even when hooked up via Ethernet). In addition, the quality of the streamed picture is OUTSTANDING... meaning it's WAY better than the quality of the picture that the same services provide via Roku.As for the sound, I haven't tried it without the soundbar, to be honest, so I can't comment on the TV's speakers. Just do yourself a favor and get a soundbar right from the get-go, assuming you don't have a home theater setup already. Reason: None of these thin TVs are going to provide you with rich sound. Period. I'm guessing this TV is no exception. That said, if you DO get a soundbar, I recommend sticking with Panasonic, so that it will turn on/off with the TV, when hooked up via an HDMI cable w/ audio return (as ours is).", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great unit....wireless works...with the \"proper adaptor\".", "Author": "Ryan A.

Some other brands mentioned difficulty with the wireless feature, but using the adapter we are able to receive with no delays or disruptions and our router is even on a different floor of our home.The picture is very clear. Color is good. We think the sound is fine.Unfortunately, the remote will not work with our cable network box so we still need two remotes. It is a cable box issue and not one with the remote. I bought a wireless keyboard to go with this TV. Don't bother with that. You cannot \"type\" into the search boxes and the mouse does not work like you'd use it on a computer screen. It is more difficult to browse Hulu and AmazonPrime directly on the TV than on a computer. Still it is really great to be able to watch these applications on the nice big screen and not on our computer monitors.I got this 42 inch version cheaper than two of the smaller screens which is why we purchased it. I was looking primarily at 32 inch because our living room is pretty small, but this 42 inch set was more cost effective and we really like it.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this TV", "Author": "Schrammy", "ReviewID": "R3AWFSDPIYNQC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just set up TV and aready love it!Great picture and easy set up.Looks great with PS3.The sound is ok but the picture quality far makes up for any sound quality issues.I used settings recommendd by previous reviewer and set looks great.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV I have ever owned!", "Author": "R.

Plus the fact that the major problem was not the Panasonic's doing!I was very excited about this set because it fit exactly into the bookcase space available for it, and there was a short, easy run to my Comcast modem. Alas:1) The set arrived, and next morning it was priced well below what I paid for it. I requested a refund.2) The first assembly required was to attach a bracket to the base with four machine crews. I could not find them, so I went to the garage and carefully went through all the packaging outtakes. I found the four screws inside a fairly large plastic bag, secured in their own compartment at the bottom, so they could not be shaken out or even found by exploring fingers. Watch for this!3) One can't run an ethernet cord to the modem but must go to the router, so I had to order a longer cord. Worse, I got only black-white reception my DVD player with component video connection, and since the new telly has only the one component input, I can't use the VHS player at all. So I ordered a $90 player from Amazon in hopes that with HDMI input I will once again see color, and also that the VHS will give better results when it takes over the component video cords. Some of this of course was to be expected: technology moves on at an increasing pace.4) When the ethernet cord arrived, I still couldn't get an internet connection. Yet when I ran the cord to the new DVD/BluRay player, it was an instant connect. I conclude I got a lemon, and I am returning it for replacement.UPDATE: Guess what? The cord (also from Amazon) was defective. When the replacement telly arrived, I had the same problem, so I tried a different ethernet cord, and behold! I had an internet connection and could watch Amazon and Netflix movies, hurrah! (By this time, the original ethernet cord didn't work with the Blu Ray player either, so clearly it has a dodgy wire somewhere, that sometimes worked and sometimes didn't.So while I am still grinding my teeth over the problems I encountered installing this gadget, I am in the end very happy with it. So--four stars!", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "An outstanding PC/Gaming Monitor", "Author": "Brant L. Rusch", "ReviewID": "R2VIKPNC8DYAH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As someone who had grown accustomed to using a 37\" Monitor as a desktop display, it took some time to find a suitable replacement for a 6+ year old Westinghouse 1st generation Monitor that was finally showing signs of age (image retention in greys that did not go away, and the lack of color fidelity and black level found in modern LCD sets).As its primary use would be as a monitor, I needed a set that had minimal Input Lag.  This is the delay between when you move your mouse or, indeed, your gamepad (Xbox 360, Computer, PS3, etc) and the action on screen registered that movement.  This is not called out in  Television specifications and has nothing to do with motion-lag, refresh rates or anything of that sort, there are few places online where one can find out this information besides a dedicated group of enthusiasts and people doing trial and error.  When using a mouse, the effect is even more pronounced.The Panasonic IPS panels are considered to have some of the lowest input lag on the market, although this varies from year to year and indeed from model to model. I'm happy to report that this set achieves this goal.  I've tried other Westinghouse sets but the visual quality on them was sub-par, I've tried an LG32\" set that when set up properly worked fine, but it was 32\" and once you get accustomed to a certain size, any step down in size feels 'tangible'.  37\" TV's seem to be a dying breed, and 42\" in my use is simply too big (due to my seating distance).The one drawback that this set has is that the screen is not a flat matte.  Its not the mirror-reflection finish of a plasma, but it is not the flat matte finish of the average laptop screen either.  This may or may not be a problem for you.  Its not for me, but it should be noted.The nice part about this set is that, thanks to its adjustable options in the user menu's, you can tell the set if the HDMI inputs to receive a computer-standard color signal or an NTSC standard color signal (affecting the overall darkness of the image), and you can further tweak the image with a DARK or LIGHT gamma setting.  These adjustments are helpful to getting the most out of your available video signal, without having things appear to washed out or having too much 'black crush' (look it up).Since this set is LED, its thin, light and costs next to nothing to run.  My old Westinghouse was quite a display, it was on nearly every day for 18 hours a day give-or-take for nearly 6 years, and never gave me any trouble.  But being a first generation product its LCD panels began to fade and while it was still perfectly usable, its best years were behind it.This Panasonic more than fills the bill, updating my desktop with multiple HDMI inputs for other devices and a modern panel with popping colors and deeper blacks, all in a much smaller, much lighter form factor with the exact same screen size.  I'm sure in another 2 years we will be on to TV's in this size with bezels measured in the millimeters but that day isn't yet here, unless you opt for a 32\" LG set with passive 3D which may or may not suit you.I'm happy with the purchase.  For PC or Console gaming its an outstanding choice with minimal input lag, and it makes a great monitor as well.JUST REMEMBER to go into the Advanced Picture Menu and change the HDMI mode from 1 (overscan) to 2 (pixel mapping).  Otherwise your windows desktop will be 'zoomed in' and the tv will be scaling everything.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quality TV, Even If Internet Features Are Lacking", "Author": "Ella Hill", "ReviewID": "R3CP2NE46DP9H4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I chose this TV because the LED panel is high-quality, there are lots (4) of HDMI ports, and it was on sale. Any TV is going to have its quirks and this one is no different. Here's what I learned:--Doesn't have a headphone jack. The description says there's 1 audio line-in (mini-phone stereo 3.5 mm) jack but it's incorrect. There isn't an analog audio out either. This means you could run into problems hooking up older speakers unless you get a digital to analog converter.--Short power cord (but it's detachable): it's about 5 ft long. Radioshack carries standard 6 ft ones, but we needed something longer and got this Startech 10 ft laptop power cord which has worked out great.--Internet: It's \"wifi ready\" but you have to buy a separate adapter. You can hook it up to the internet using an ethernet cable, though. We moved it to a corner with ethernet as a test, but the whole \"Viera Connect\" experience is pretty clunky. For less than the cost of a really long ethernet cable, a powerline adapter, or Panasonic's wifi adapter you can just buy a Roku which has more features/apps, an easier interface, and customer support if you need it.--Still troubleshooting: Doesn't play well with Zvox Z-Base 320 speakers. Somehow the TV overrides the speakers' standby mode and so when you turn the TV off, it completely powers down the speakers. To turn the speakers back on, you have to use the toggle switch at the back of the unit (no power to pick up remote signal).OTHER INFO--Power Consumption: 46 W--Stand dimensions (useful if shopping for sound bars): Base is 9.8\" deep total and sticks out 3.8\" in front of the screen. It's 15.8\" long and it raises the TV 1.8\" higher.--Jack locations: If you're watching TV, the input/output connections are on the left.--Panasonic has an augmented reality app on their website (\"Panasonic AR Setup Simulator\") that lets you see what various size TVs would look like in your room. It's pretty useful if you're trying to decide between \"big\" and \"too big.\"OVERALL: 4 stars because it works great as a TV (excellent picture quality as others have mentioned). I only subtracted 1 star for the issues mentioned above because they were easy to fix and are experienced with most TVs. I would recommend this TV if you have an Apple TV/Roku/XBox.

Purchased directly from Panasonic, since it was not yet available from Amazon.  We are thrilled with our 47\" Panasonic. Much better than our older 720P Toshiba LCD which had developed a slight cloud across the center of the screen.  Still playing with the features, but so far so good.  Picture quality is fantastic.  We have our FiOS router inside our entertainment center, so we run ethernet to the TV; no need for wireless for us.  It is very nice to have the option of using the Viera Android App to control the TV (via its connection to our home network).  We connected coax to the TV to view the non-scrambled FiOS channels as well as the HDMI cable from the Set Top Box to one of the four HDMI inputs on the TV to view all FiOS content. Both input methods work perfectly.  It is great to be able to pop the SD card out of our video (or still) camera and view the content via the SD slot on the TV without the need to connect the camera via cables. TV has one SD slot and two USB slots; accessible from the back - not a big issue for us, but easier access from the front might be helpful to some people. Multiple video and audio formats are supported for playback directly by the TV.  Have setup DLNA access for the TV from our home computer system. Works well, but not a critical feature for us, since we have an HDMI connection from the computer to the TV. (DLNA does give us the option of perhaps moving the PC to a different room at some point...)  Minor complaints:  1) Audio output is optical only. Why not include analog out and/or a headphone jack???  [Optical output only seems to be the way the big TVs are going.] There are converters that will convert the optical signal to analog (price for stereo is not too bad, but full theater is higher than I want to spend for a converter). I am looking at spending a bit more and purchasing a Panasonic home theater system which includes the \"Audio Return Channel\" feature which will transfer audio from the TV to the audio system via the HDMI cable.  2) Would have liked an additional input or two; perhaps available from the front without having to reach behind the TV to get to them. [TV has 4 HDMI inputs and a single non-HDMI input which can be used for AV or Component input via the included adapter. All inputs are accessible from the left side (as one is facing the screen) rear of the TV.  3) There is an \"Intelligent Audio\" feature which is supposed to normalize the volume across the input channels. We turned this on, but the audio from the FiOS Set Top Box comes out louder than the other input channels. (I have tried adjusting the STB volume; this seems to change the level for the audio out jacks on the STB, but not on the HDMI output...)  4) My wife is shopping for a new entertainment center to fit our larger TV. (I prefer the less expensive pedestal option...)  5) TV media player does not have an option to play all of the video on the SD card from our camcorder from one request - we can request play of at most one folder at a time; which for us is day-by-day playback. I would love an option to \"Play All\".  We had been considering this against the Panasonic TC-L47E50. Based on a side-by-side comparison the only difference appeared to be the suite of available internet apps; which was not important to us, since we have a PC connected to the TV for internet access. We later learned that the refresh rate (not included in the side-by-side comparison) is 2x greater on the E50 vs. the E5. So far we have not seen any issues due to the lower refresh rate.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "holy @%^%$E$$ WOW!", "Author": "1sttimebuyer", "ReviewID": "R14QYAZ7C1U1S1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an awesome tv. we bought this as a gift.

Lifting the television says it requires a team lift, but if you're careful, you can manage this thing pretty easily and set it up by yourself on the stand. If you are wall mounting it I would recommend two people, however. I love pretty much everything about this TV, but I have some gripes with it as well.First of all, the size upgrade from 32\" to 47\" is very notable. I got lost in the size of this thing in my living room the first few days. The picture is also very clear and crisp.The jump from 720p to 1080p is also a huge difference, and my X360, PS3 and HD cable box look great. The TV is also notably better than my old Sony in a couple ways. First, the Sony would overheat after a few hours of continued use, and this one doesn't. It will also turn itself off after your HDMI input powers down, so if you fall asleep watching a movie or have to leave in a hurry it won't waste power. Also, the Sony would pick up the slight glare from the edge of the curtains and it would fog up the corner of the screen. The glare doesn't effect this new Panasonic at all. It is a very worthy upgrade in size, definition and build quality over my old TV.And while this TV still does deserve five stars, there are a few things that irritate me about it. For one, if you have old school game systems, the adapter that comes with the TV will only support one at a time, so if you switch between them you'll have to get behind your TV and switch them out. Not fun if your TV is up against a wall/corner or on a bulky oak stand like mine. Also, if you have old school audio, this TV is digital audio only. It will only support a toslink cable, and you can not use a digital-RCA splitter box as far as I know because this this TV does not give you the option for LR speaker sound. I can still wire my sub and standing speakers in with a digital system, but now I have to drop some money on some new speakers and an amp. I'm currently lining in to some cheap Logitech speakers until I can afford some new ones. I would not recommend using the built-in speakers in this TV, as they do not sound too great at all.Pros+Big enough screen for most rooms/people+Excellent picture quality+Doesn't pick up too much glare+Doesn't overheat after extended useCons-Built-in speakers are not that greatPros/Cons-If you have old school audio and video game systems like me, this TV will be a bit of a struggle.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV for under $400 (when it is onsale)", "Author": "SweetHubby", "ReviewID": "RRWR7OGRQJIC6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this is a 60hz, Panasonic claims as 180 BLS isn't really comparable to 120hz, in case if you are wondering or confused.USB Port DOES NOT READ USB-powered-HDD, don't blame the TV, it says clearly, Thumb Drive or SD Card ONLY.TV Remote control works well on the SONY Network MEDIA Player if you connected thru HDMI.THE BAD IS THIS TV DOES NOT HAVE RCA AUDIO OUT, the Chipset has Headphone output but This Model does not get the jack(50cents for part).

I was tempted to buy another Samsung since I've owned several in the past and have generally been happy with them but after doing some additional research I learned that Samsung now uses 4 different manufacturers for the panels in their TV and they can vary quite a bit in quality depending on brand.  This means that the picture quality of the Samsung will vary depending on how lucky you are and what brand panel you receive in your set.  The bottom line is that I was not willing to take a chance on another Samsung and end up with another low quality Chi Mei branded panel in my set so I decided to go with the Panasonic 37 inch TV instead even though it was almost $130 more than the Samsung.Overall I am happy with the TV and have decided I will keep it even though I have a few gripes with it.  Even after adjusting the factory video settings on the Panasonic both my wife and I agreed the Samsung colors were slightly more vivid.  Please don't interpret this to mean the Panasonic has a bad picture. Like I said the picture quality is VERY GOOD and we probably would not have noticed the difference had we not had both TV's running at the same time side by side.  Now for my main gripes about the TV.....Which genius engineer at Panasonic thought it would be a good idea to place the speakers facing the rear of the TV??  I am dumfounded as to why anyone would design a TV so that the sound is projected away from the viewer.  Basically the sound quality is terrible on this TV and it's hard to hear anything unless you turn the volume way up or use an external speaker system.  Turning the volume up is not a very acceptable solution in my opinion because the speakers start sounding very \"tinny\" and somewhat distorted especially at higher volumes.  I decided to go with an external speaker system which works great in terms of audio quality but it also leads to my second main gripe.  The Panasonic only has a optical audio output which means you will need to buy a digital to analog converter and a Toslink cable if you plan on hooking up your TV to an older set of wireless headphones or an older audio system that uses composite cables.  These converters sell for around $20 but keep in mind that with optical audio you will not be able to use the TV remote to lower or raise the volume and will need to control the volume directly through your stereo receiver remote or headphone volume knob.  The Samsung has both a digital and analog audio output using a standard 3.5mm audio jack on the back so you wouldn't run into that issue.On a positive note the Panasonic is heavier and feels much more solid and well built that the Samsung which is made primarily of plastic.  Another positive feature is the Panasonic's online movie functionality which we found to be great!!  We never used Netflix before but we started the free 1 month trial and have liked it enough that we have decided to keep the subscription service after the trial period expires.  Our TV is hooked to the internet through an ethernet cable using a powerline adapter but this should work fine via wireless if we later decide to purchase the optional wireless adapter.  I realize you can get this same functionality from 3rd party products such as the Roku streaming player but it is nice having the functionality built directly into the set.***********************  UPDATE  04/08/2013  ***********************I've now owned this TV for more than a week and while I am quite happy with the picture quality and Netflix movie functionality I am becoming increasingly annoyed with the optical audio output issue. If you plan on using the built in speakers only this issues should NOT affect you but if you plan on using external speakers or headphones you should be made fully aware of these issues.  I have a Vizio sound bar that has both an analog and an optical audio input on it but when I connect it directly to the optical output on the TV only certain channels provide sound.  It turns out that is due to the fact that some programs are broadcast using Dolby sound and many sound bars and wireless headphones do not support Dolby sound.  This means that you will either have to live with switching between your external speakers/headphones and using the built in speakers or you'll have buy a digital to analog converter that will decode Dolby sound.  The cheap $20 digital to analog converter I bought previously to use with my wireless headphones does not decode Dolby so I had the same problem with only getting external audio with certain program and movies.  I ended up having to spend $40 to buy another converter that does decode Dolby sound.  The new converter seems to be working fine but there have been a few instances where the sound will suddenly cut out completely (while using Netflix only) and won't come back unless I stop the Netflix broadcast completely and then re-start it using the \"resume\" feature.  I'm not sure if this is a Netflix issue or a Panasonic issue but nonetheless it is still annoying but manageable. All of this could have easily been avoided if Panasonic had simply included an analog audio output on the TV like the Samsung has.I've provided a link below for the correct converter you will need that will Decode Dolby sound.CE Compass Digital SPDIF / Coaxial to Analog L/R RCA Audio Decoder w/ 3.5mm Headphone Jack", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Very Happy", "Author": "J.

I had purchased the TC-L42E50 model for myself already, which had slightly better specs during the Cyber Monday deals (2012).What I thought was the only difference was that the TC-L42E5 had a refresh rate of 60hz, but my TC-L42E50 had 120hz.  Both have Viera Link, and I had assumed that all the apps included would be the same, but that isn't true.  On the TC-L42E5, it has Netflix and other apps, but no Youtube.  My fiance had hoped that it would have the Youtube app so that her parents could watch Chinese videos on Youtube.  Doesn't make too much sense as to why Panasonic would leave out a mere app, even though the TV is internet ready.  So what they have to depend on is using a PC to watch Youtube videos on the TV - an inconvenient workaround...I can't review the picture/sound quality as my fiance's parents live in another state.  But if the only main technical difference is the refresh rate, then I'm sure the quality is pretty good for a TV at this price, as I have no complaints about the model I picked up for myself - the TC-L42E50So... what we accomplished is getting rid of their old CRT TV.  But unfortunately it didn't come with the main feature/app they were looking for.  Hence the 3 stars.

It's a hit or miss. Mostly the power light just blinks on and off but the TV rarely comes on. We've always been big Panasonic fans but this product missed the mark by a long shot. We have been able to get no support.

It is very light, but the picture seems too small to be a 32\" or maybe I remembered the size of my Sharp incorrectly. It has a good picture, but I don't really like any of the viewing \"formats\". Not sure if I would like the Viera better if I had gotten a bigger size, but I miss my old (08) Aquos. I propbably would have bought another one (Aquos) but couldn't find one I could afford. This size Viera is definitly better suited for a den or bedroom (small ones...) and I have it in the L.R. I would have returned it but I needed something to watch!

I told her I didn't have access to a fax machine but would try new screws 1st.In the mean time I tried out the TV and no matter how I set the settings I wasn't happy with the picture.Not even close to the 4 year old panasonic plasma tv that I have.  Anyway, I called cust. serv. 2 weeks later to find out that they didn't send out the missing screws because I didn't send a FAX.That was the last straw. I knew I had a 30 day free buyback plan with Amazon so I researched Consumer Reports for a replacement. They recommended a Samsung LCD 40\".So I ordered it and 4 days later it was delivered by UPS.Put it together the next day and put the panasonic back in the box.Amazon said they'd take care of telling UPS to pick up the panasonic.UPS came the next day and got it.  The Samsung is amazing. It has a picture that is better than my 4 year old Panasonic plasma.I would like to thank Amazon for all their help, and say to anyone thinking about buying a Panasonic LED to think again.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far not good", "Author": "Mohammad A.

Great selection. If you want more though, get a Roku.It was having problems working with my ATT uVerse Box. Kept flickering till it had no connection at all.

I won't know until tomorrow though, because its a new box and I haven't been able to test it anywhere else.I have the TV hooked up via Ethernet to my router. The Netflix apps works awesome, and so does the Vudu. Vudu HDX looks awesome on this set. I did a speed test with the Vudu app and it remained over 9mbps the whole time (my internet is 12mpbs). So that was good. UNFORGIVABLY, the Hulu APP IS TRASH. Hulu has 4 bandwith modes, 650kbps, 1mbps, 2mbps(HD), and 3.2mbps(HD). The HD Streams DO NOT WORK. They constantly lag in and out and work for only a second or two. This is a BIG DEAL.
