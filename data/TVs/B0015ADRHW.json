I liked it better than the Samsung or Toshiba which were highly rated.  The picture is sharper and the contrast deeper than other 32\" LCD TVs selling at a higher price.  I have it connected to DirecTV HD.  You couldn't ask for a better picture or better sound for that size TV.", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice picture, horrible controller design", "Author": "Byron Caudle", "ReviewID": "R3T2ZFXLLDT2E7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The picture quality on this TV is amazing, but everything else about it pretty much stinks. It does what it was designed to do, but the design was BAD from the start.With the tuner:1. No signal strength meter2. Dolby digital via optical out stops working about every 20 minutes, and you have to change the channel back and forth to get it to work again.3. Analog and digital channels are mixed together in numerical order. This is soon to be a moot point, but I have never seen another TV that does this.4. If you use the buttons on the TV itself, you will ALWAYS end up changing the tuner setting to cable. Change it back, but only through the menu.5. If you enter a channel number from the remote, it always assumes you mean an analog channel number unless you give it a sub channel. Didn't they hear that analog broadcast is going away??Other issues:1. Analog audio for HDMI 1 = doesn't work, and no option to select digital or analog audio.2. Slow startup. It's not lcd projector kind of slow, but it is annoying.3. Menu text is too small, with no option to change.4. No analog or digital optical audio out when receiving signals from an HDMI source (INTERNAL SPEAKERS ONLY). So you have to use some other connection directly from the source device if you want to have better sound. sort of defeats the idea of ONE cable with HDMI..LCD panel maker: A+JVC controller design: F", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Hookup to a receiver is a horror!", "Author": "Buck Green", "ReviewID": "R2O4TPGQW5684W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got my JVC LT32E479 LCD TV just before the holiday. I have two other LCD TVs which are were very easy to hook up to a receiver for theater sound because they have a switching \"source\" button on their remotes and the familiar \"AV1\" and \"AV2\" source inputs. The JVC has no switching source button on the remote and although there are LV1, LV2, LV3, LV4 and LV5 shown on the remote and on the diagram in the accompanying manual, getting this TV to recognize my DVD player/recorder hooked up to the receiver  has been impossible. A phone call to JVC's help line was useless because the person who answered was not knowledgeable on this issue. I am very disappointed. Had I known the TV precludes a conventional receiver/DVD hookup in order to control the TV and components through the receiver, I never would have purchased this unit. I am awaiting an email response from JVC on this issue but I am not optimistic about their ability to give me a solution since this receiver was seemingly designed to preclude the control of it and components with a receiver. Another gripe is that the only way to shut off the sound from the TV's internal speakers in order to use your external surround sound speakers is to dial down the internal speakers to zero--there is no \"select internal or external speakers\" on a menu like my other LCD TVs.", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV, better then the rest :)!!!", "Author": "D.
