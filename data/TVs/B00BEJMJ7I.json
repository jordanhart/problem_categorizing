In addition, I was going to use an indoor antenna so the tuner was critical. I get all the air channels except those prefaced with 18 (Seventh-Day Adventist channels in Chattanooga, TN), but all of the other air channels come in great so I figure it has something to do with the antenna or possibly the Channel 18 TV station. At any rate, I am very pleased with it.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BEJMJ7I"}}
