I knew I would be paying extra for a Sony, but decided to make the plunge, since other 40\" screens were several inches wider. This set is slim and atractive.I have only had this set for a weeks and am still learning about it's many functions.  My set is attached to cable, a blu-ray player for DVDs, and an older Denon A/V amp via S-Video for sound output.Before buying, I researched features availble in a 40\" LCD set in the store and on-line.  This set led the pack in many ways.  The picture is incredable.  Plus, if you are into adjustments, you have a great deal of control over the picture settings.  I have viewed in a highly lit room as well as in the dark.  It's high contrast ratio makes it easy to watch in both situations.  I can not detect the blurring, many LDCs suffer from in action sceans.It packs all the latest video inhancements but most importantly, 120Hz, 24p.  The built in speaker is even good, and makes a reasonable attempt at surround sound considerng it's is a single source speaker.  Of course when hooked up to a A/V reciever, it makes movies come alive. I have not connected to a LAN yet, but am curious to try, soon.It is loaded with input options (HDMI, LAN, USB, Composit, S-Video, etc).  The only thing I would like to see is a more versitile USB port, so I could plug in a wireless reciever.  This system has to be hard wired to a LAN.  It would be nice if the computer input ports were on the side of the set, so it did not have to be pulled out to make these attachemnts.The stand could be improved, it does not allow for any adjustment. It was not a big deal for me, since the set sits at eye level, but if it was sitting anywhere else, you would need to purchase an adjustable mount, which are axpensive for a set this size.The manual is somewhat limited.  There are many set-up options that are not full explained.  I called Sony for a setup question.  They answered fairly quickly.  The first rep had me try several different things, but was not much help.  Then he passed me on to the \"blu-ray\" expert, who answered my question in seconds.Overall, this is a great set, I deffinately recommend it.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect : > /", "Author": "CJ \"ChefJeff\"", "ReviewID": "R1I2Z7DNLK66AR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When the price of this Sony dropped to $1429, I jumped on it, when it launched it was $2299, not that long ago either.I got my XRB-6 two days ago, the picture quality is amazing! I have never seen colors so vibrant and clear.I must say though, like I read about clouding issues with other Sony sets, well to my disappointment, it's true, when the screen goes black, there are visible clouds, it's not really a big deal, but since I've been reading about this problem for some time, I would have expected Sony to correct it. Not sure if I'm going to keep this set or not, other than that it's close to perfection, just not sure I can live with this defect or not.My previous set was a cheap Polaroid 37\" 1080i, it had no clouding issues though, this problem seems to be exclusive to Sony.Gonna try to adjust the settings, this set has many controls to adjust settings, and there is a control where you can reduce the backlight, which is what is causing this problem.Right now though, I have very mixed feelings, I never had a problem with a Sony before, so I expect perfection.Will update after I make the adjustments to see if it helps any.Update: I made adjustments to the backlight control, if you lower the setting 3 levels, and turn the tv to power save mode, the clouding issues are mostly gone, but your overall picture is much darker, a trade off for getting rid of the clouds.My clouding issues were not too bad, other owners reported clouding covering 50% or more of their screen, my clouding was minimal, sets with this problem seem to have different levels of clouding.Bottom line, I've decided to keep the tv, the pros far outweigh this minor issue.I can't help but wonder if the XBR-8 priced at 5 grand has this problem too.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Product, Terrible Shipping Experience", "Author": "Thomas A. Seitz", "ReviewID": "RLYTV7SK18BK0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The XBR is more or less the \"Mercedes\" of the TV industry, while everyone else compares their product to the Sony, it remains the pinnacle of the LCD game.  I looked at both the Samsung and the Sony, both were spectacular.  In fact, Samsung makes the screen for the Sony, so it makes sense they are the same.  Bottom line, there is simply more \"coolness\" to the Sony name.The TV is great, but Amazon's white glove shipping stinks. I bought the product, and it sat on several docks for days, finally got through to the shipper, scheduled for Saturday.  But guess what? no TV.  Have to schedule multiple times - I guess free shipping implies \"worthless\". The drivers are late, never call back, and all you get is an answering service.

Mura is the technical term for a cloudy looking background image appearing on an LCD screen in dark or black scenes.  The mura in the set I purchased covered a good 60% of the total area.  Sony agreed to replace the LCD display panel after it was examined by a certified technician in our home.  I decided NOT to go that route as the set was only one week out of the box and one month from its manufacture date.  Besides, my research uncovered that the cost of the part was twice the cost of what I paid for the new set in the first place.  Amazon customer service department and CEVA/Eagle shipping were both very professional and responsive to the problem, and I was promptly credited the full purchase price.Since we've happily owned a 42\"  Sony plasma flat screen TV for three years now, we decided to stay with plasma technology.  LCD technology has certainly improved over the years, but mura problems still exist, even in the newest models.  BUYERS BEWARE - save ALL original packing materials for at least two weeks after your new set arrives.  MURA DOES NOT SHOW UP IMMEDIATEY OUT OF THE BOX.  Carefully examine the screen during \"blackouts\" on the screen; between commercials or channel changes.  AND, sit low to the screen and look up at a slightly upward angle during the examination.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony XBR6 TV -- Outstanding!  A few cautions . . .", "Author": "Power User", "ReviewID": "R20WIBARR3S54L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We expected to be blown away by the Sony XBR6, especially since so many people rank it even with or better than the Samsung 750.  And the picture is great - when you get all the adjustments fine tuned.  The Steelers trouncing of the Browns game was gorgeous!  We highly recommend it but with a few cautions:-  Not the set for the \"set it and forget it\" type.  Many adjustments required but it is beautiful when you get done.-  Sound.  We heard many complaints about the sound from LCD sets so picked the XBR6 specifically because it has an internal subwoofer.  But we found the subwoofer made little difference even when set to maximum, especially if you put the TV in a cabinet where the sound gets trapped inside.  We fixed this by hooking up an external powered subwoofer to the sound output jacks on the rear of the set.  Made a phenomenal difference - I highly recommend this if you can't use a surround sound receiver.  And you can't do it on the Samsung (see below).-  Network upgrades.  Features are evolving fast on LCD TV's so we wanted one that had the Ethernet cable jack to download the latest firmware versions over time.  But according to Sony customer support their website that checks for new firmware is down, and even if it was working you still have to do the upgrade by downloading it to your computer and moving it to the TV via the USB port.  I think they are wrong but did not have time to debate it with them.-  Signal diagnostics.  According to Sony customer support this option only tells you the signal strength of broadcast TV.  The website and manual make you think it looks at each signal coming into the set to tell you what resolution it is, etc.  Again, I think the support rep was wrong but not a big deal.-  Not all USB devices work with the XBR6 USB port.  To Sony's credit they state this clearly in the manual, but it was still frustrating to move a lot of pictures to a USB drive and then not be able to view them on the TV.-  Digital Media Port.  This seems to be a confused option.  The reviews have way too many complaints about what works and what doesn't when using it to connect iPods, etc.  So instead of using the DMP we bought the Apple iPod composite connection cable and it works very well - even when playing movies from the iPod.Pros:-  Feature set.  All the benefits of 120 Hz, 24p, higher contrast, etc., are real and work well on the XBR6.  Be ready to turn the 120Hz off at times (motion enhancer) because it works so well movies can end up looking \"artificially good\" (soap opera looking is the term we heard).  But turning it off and on is easy.-  Picture is more natural than Samsung.  The Samsung 750 can be stunning in the store but the color intensity can actually be fatiguing when you get it home.  You can adjust it, but we liked the natural color of the Sony XBR6 better.  The \"Vivid\" mode on the Sony can still crank up the color when you want it.-  Variable sound output.  The Samsung only has fixed sound output jacks.  The Sony XBR6's can be set to be variable.  This made it possible for us to feed a powered subwoofer and control the sound level at the same time as the TV speakers with the remote control.  Very nice effect without the complexity of a full surround sound receiver set up.-  Slim design.  The width of the frame around the screen is the smallest we saw.  This enabled us to fit the 40\" XBR6 into our exiting entertainment center.  Also minimizes the frame when hanging the set on a wall.  The Samsung frame is much wider and has that \"touch of color\" tinting that we think distracts from the TV screen.-  No \"cloud\" effect.  Not sure what this is but other reviewers mentioned it.  We had no problem.-  Many, many input jacks including USB, LAN, HDMI on the side, etc.-  Deals can be had.  Shop!  We originally paid $1700, which was the best deal at the time.  Then got a price match to $1560 just before Christmas.  But the final deal was the combination incentive with the Sony s550 Blu-ray disc player which put the set at just over $1000!  (If you don't need the Blu-ray you can resell it easily for more than you pay in the combo deal.)", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "master.aXu", "ReviewID": "R2U5AA589CGM9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV set meets all my expectations in terms of video and sound quality. I subscribe to all 5 star reviews here. I haven't noticed any clouding or mura effect so far.A few minor things to mention:- the remote is a little long for my taste but it has everything it needs on it, even backlighting. Sometimes you need two hands to handle it which makes me look like my grandpa trying to find the keys on the remote.- shipping company Manna, called to reschedule the delivery time and date at the time when they were supposed to knock at the door. Good thing it came in perfect condition.- the TV is kind of hard to take out of the box, other brands have the fancy box that opens sideways. Sony, when you take it out you need to place it on the pedestal right away. You wouldn't want to put it on the floor sitting on the speakers which are directly attached to a glass panel.This is a great product. No buyer's remorse here.Oh, I almost forgot: Power consumption is a lot less than the 225W advertised. My P3 Kill a Watt monitor shows 80W when it's ON and 0.18W when it's OFF.

Marr \"philosophos\"", "ReviewID": "R2YSQD5M53DQJD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey Gang,The 40\" XBR6 television is fantastic.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  After two weeks of ownership I can say with confidence that this was a great purchase.  As a Sony buff I like the set's full integration with my laptop and camera.  The deal now running on Amazon to throw in a matching Blu-Ray player is a steal.I did a tremendous amount of research on Sony's HDTV product line and the price on this near high-end set caused me to bite.  Moving up from vhs+dvd on a 20\" WEGA tube set has been a revelation.There are some hyper-critics out there who can find minor faults with this product but I'm not one of 'em.  Blacks are deep and colors are vibrant.  Sports are eye-popping.  Even without cable or satellite service my programming is HD and amazing quality.  Ditch cable and watch PBS in HD!If you table mount this television I do recommend purchasing two accessories direct from sony: the support belt kit and the anchor bolt.  Proper use of these prevent accidental tipping of the tall, top heavy set.  Order these items via telephone in the US 800 488 7669, they cost under 11 bucks delivered, a tiny investment compared to the cost of the set.By the way, a Blu-Ray player such as the s550 is essential pairing.  Not only does Netflix now offer Blu-Ray selections, wow, but the player upscales DVD to the screen's native resolution to splendid effect.Keep up the good work Sony!", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Simply the Best", "Author": "Gadget Guy", "ReviewID": "R5LQIWF4TZG9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many of you, I get a liitle obsessed when deciding on a tech purchase. I studied HDTV's intently from August to Christmas. I visited every store, read every review and kept watch of every forum. The three finalists were the Panasonic 800 series plasma, Samsung 650-850 series LCD and the Sony XBR6.The Panasonic has great color reproduction and plasmas are far superior in off-angle viewing but the shiny screen and overall \"dullness\" of the picture requires that viewing is best in a darker room. The Samsung 650 offers good bang for the buck but the picture just seemed less realistic than the Sony. The Samsung 850 is thinner so the backlight is closer to the screen and creates a better picture than the 650. But the price is quite close to the Sony and the Sony still looks more realistic.Samsungs are very vivid in their default setting. The colors \"pop\" but tend to look artificial. Of course you can change the settings and tone them down but the Sony XBR6 consistently looks more real. Samsungs also have the shiny screen and it does show reflections in even a moderately lit room.I've had the 40\" XBR6 for a few weeks now and it is fantastic! It looks even better now than it did the first week. Blu Ray is superb and HD cable looks great. ESPN in HD is amazing. Standard broadcast is also very good but you can't make a blanket statement about how a HDTV handles standard content. It all depends on the source. Some content looks great while others are blurry. It's not the TV's fault. The sound is excellent, no need for extra speakers. I have no clouding issues at all. The only knock on this TV, and all LCD TV's, is off-angle viewing. The colors wash out at a 45 degree angle but we watch this set head on so its not an issue.I watch the TV from 12 feet away and its perfect. I had a 46\" for a few weeks because the \"experts\" say 12 feet should be a 46-50\" but it was too big. It was beautiful but it just overwhelmed us and we couldn't enjoy it. If you want a full home theater effect go bigger but if you don't want to be moving your eyes and head back and forth all the time get the 40\".If I could give the delivery a separate rating it would be 1 star. The TV started out from a warehouse only 400 miles away and it took 15 days to arrive. The tracking showed it just sitting in a warehouse 20 miles from me for three staight days. I wasnt given any contact info for CEVA so I had to complain to Amazon and get them to get CEVA on the ball. When the TV finally arrived the delivery men just set the box down and asked me to sign. I asked them if this is all they were going to do and they said \"yes\". So much for \"White Glove\" delivery. I've seen enough complaints about CEVA that Amazon should rethink it's relationship with them. At least provide contact info for CEVA in the very first email. Amazon has always been first-rate with me but this delivery was a joke.Anyway, you don't need to waste 200 hours studying TV's like I did. (unless you secretly like to do that sort of thing!)

Like many, read all the reviews, went to all the stores, looked at all the comparable models side by side.  Did my diligent duty to become informed as I only purchase a new TV about every 10 yrs. or so.  Have been partial to Sony and have had nothing but great luck with the Sony brand.  But with eyes and mind open, took a serious look at Samsung, Panasonic, Sharp, Mitsubishi, etc.  The Samsung came close, but no cigar.  Then the problem of several Sony 40 inch models available for purchase.  Don't be fooled, the w, y, and z level models are NOT the XBR6.  If you want the absolute best, its the XBR model.  And the XBR6 will give you all the picture you can handle.  No need in my opinion to go for the XBR7, etc.  You'll pay a bit more, but over an expected 10 or more life, its less than $50/yr.  Have had my set for several weeks now, and the picture is just outstanding.  The contrast ratio is unbelievable with the brightest colors, blackest blacks,etc. Hi-Def is absolutely amazing.  Note: the cloud factor that some write about is a NON factor in my opinion.  The set up is easy and user friendly.  Got the Sony Blu Ray 550 and it compliments this set beautifully.

Since I found the comments on Amazon helpful in deciding to buy these items, I wanted to add my impressions for others who may be considering the same purchase.The quality of the picture is wonderful. Perhaps I am more impressed because I am moving up from a Sony 27 WEGA. My Direct TV HD upgrade will not be installed for about two weeks so I decided to get an inexpensive indoor antenna (Philips Silver Sensor)to use in the meantime. I live in on the third floor of a building in Chicago. I pick up all the Chicago broadcast HD signals flawlessly with this set and the antenna.The XBR provides lots of opportunities for individual adjustments. For example, the closed captioning can be modified in terms of font, size, color, background, etc.Several people have commented about the physical configuration of the remote. The two concentric circles of buttons in the middle of the remote can be initially confusing and it is difficult to push the buttons on the inner circle since they are small. This is easy to solve - just push the center button (select) the same time you push one of the inner directional buttons.It appears that people have had some good and  some bad experiences with the \"White Glove\" delivery process through Amazon. Mine was all favorable. Once I got my tracking number from Amazon I went directly to the CEVA web page and used the number to track my delivery. They will send emails each time there has been a status change. They called to schedule the delivery three days earlier than Amazon had predicted. When the delivery truck was delayed because of heavy Friday night traffic, the driver called to let me know they would be about an hour late. Once they arrived, they removed the set from the box, set it up on its stand and then placed the set on my furniture. The driver suggested that I not turn on the set for about an hour since it had been in his truck in sub freezing weather since early in the morning - he said they were delivering about 35 HDTVs that day! This seemed good advice to me. I hooked up all of my equpment while waiting for the tv to get to room temperature.

Thankfully, I received one of the good sets. To see a photographic example of what mura (or clouding) looks like, please see the photos in the following web-page:[...]In spite of the clouding/flashlight issues, XBR6 customers who received good sets with minimal or no clouding/flashlights were raving about the phenomenal picture quality and detail, especially in Blu-Ray.For example, here is the review of a person who actually owned a Samsung 850 Series and a Sony XBR6 for a month. He made a detailed, up-close comparison of the two at his home (rather than the typical in-store comparison):[...]I had been a huge Sony buff from childhood, and took the risk of purchasing this set online. Thankfully, so far, my set has been free from serious clouding/flashlight issues. Picture quality is amazing in HD channels. The colors are vibrant and the details are very good. The sound system is also excellent. I am also glad that Sony has a matte screen (as opposed to the reflective screens of most Samsungs) since my room gets a lot of ambient light.It also seemed as if the picture quality got better with more usage.My only gripe is with the design of the remote. The backlight feature is useless as the labels of the buttons are NOT printed on the button, but above it. The most annoying thing about the remote is the absolutely shoddy \"concentric-circle\" button design. These are the most frequently used buttons. They are so closely spaced that one invariably presses one button for another.There is a lag when channel is changed on my cable-box when both the audio and video drop out for a few seconds, not sure if it is an issue with the TV or the cable-box or the HDMI connection.

I just wanted to post my support for Sony making a very nice LCD-based HDTV.I'm not a high end video enthusiast, and I bought the unit on sale ($1700), as I thought the launch price of $2500 was WAY too much.  Anyway, I mostly use it with my Playstation 3 games and Blu-Ray movies, and may use it for PC gaming later.  The images are nice and crisp and the anti-judder \"motionflow\" is creepy, but cool.  Watching Rambo 4 panning sequences makes it look like actual live action, so for movies that are shot natively at 24 FPS, the technology has a \"wow factor\" that has to be seen to be believed.  Wipeout HD looks fantastic on it, and seeing Blu-Ray resolution images on something of this size (or bigger) is a noticeable step up in visual quality that standard DVD resolutions just don't have even if they are upscaled.  I plugged in my wife's laptop and with a gold-plated VGA connector, the 1280X1024 resolution was good, but her laptop doesn't offer a 1920X1080 resolution so if you have the intent to use the HDTV as a giant computer monitor, check to make sure your video card has the option of 1920X1080.  The unit includes some JPEG images hardwired to the Linux-powered BRAVIA system, and so the colors are really robust on a high quality still picture.  The navigation menus are pretty easy to use including the network setup.  The audio has a good volume to it, and there is just enough bass to balance everything out.  The simulated surround sound also works nicely.  The unit feels like it is under 50 pounds so it's easily movable and the chassis is very attractive (I like the \"floating LED\" on the front).So far the only negative here is that the remote control cannot control my Playstation 3 Blu-Ray DVD functionality.  I assumed that it would...If you can get this HDTV under $2000, like the price I paid for it, it's still expensive, but I think it's worth it.Update: While the product is excellent more than 2 years later, I was made aware of Sony's hostile attitude to people tinkering with their stuff, such as the way Sony completely overreacted to the hacker GeoHot jailbreaking the Playstation 3.  Apparently Sony was also involved with some kind of rootkit fiasco several years ago and before that they sued a Playstation 1 emulator out of existence (called BLEEM), so this will be the last Sony product I buy for a long time until they change their attitude about reverse engineering their products.

Ironically, when I checked multiple flat panel TVs at Costco, none showed bad pixels and only a few had background problems ... even though prices were a fraction of what we paid for this Sony TV.

It is a 32 inch, but has an incredible picture and has been the best sony lcd tv ever of to this point.I have never had a problem with it, and I love it... but I wanted something bigger...With that being said, I am going to put the hurt on this tv & sony a bit, so others will not be as disappointed as I was & hopefully someone very important from Sony manufacturing will read this review and finally make some important changes.So, a few weeks ago when I was finally able to afford to purchase this tv after two years of wanting it, I rushed to my favorite store(best buy) to get my hands on it, beings that it has been discontinued made me want it more.I thought I had all my bases covered, considering during those 2 years I had researched this tv in about every way I possibly could think of...Well I was wrong!I had read about the clouding/mura problems, but they seemed to diminish over the 2 years and like many other people, I counted on the fact that SONY had taken care of the problem in their lcd tv's...Well, I was again wrong!!The cons...1. the tv is has poor construction... The bottom speaker is in a terrible spot with almost no support. It is difficult when moving or lifting the tv to avoid contact with it.2. the tv doesnt rotate, and believe me with this speaker issue, it needs to be able to rotate.3. The clouding is DEFINATELY evident... Now I know that some of the previous reviewers downplayed the clouding issue, but if your like me(a true movie goer, and someone who thinks you should get what you pay for) then you will be disappointed with the clouding issue.The clouding does not always appear, and it mostly appears when the screen has black in it, but sometimes it covers over half the screen when it appears...and then right when you think it is gone, then it shows up again and ruins your experience.3. The cost is outrageous for a tv that has this kind of issue & compared to other Samsung, Sharp, LG, and even other Sony models, the tv is Grossly overpriced anyway.4. This tv DOES NOT have the best picture of the Sony line of lcds.5. Several members of the best buy home theater staff warned me about this tv, and recommended other brands. Im not talking about just 1 or 2 salesman, Im talking about all of them! Well I had to see it for myself, so now like them I agree(do not buy it).6. Sony obviously does not stand behind this product, or they would have fixed the problem a long time ago & they would have lowered the price to compensate for the problem. They just continued to sell this model tv as if nothing was wrong or they just DIDNT CARE.7. the sound quality is sub par from the tv speaker.Pros...The tv has a decent picture & some very cool features like the tv guide feature and some of the remote features.Now with all that being said...Thank Gosh Best Buy offers a 30day no questions asked return policy on anything you buy from them.So, after 2 weeks of thinking the problem really didnt exist, ignoring other reviewers & salesman, and even having 2 installers come out and again tell me that I should take it back to exchange it for a samsung, I finally packaged it back up and returned it.Before I left best buy that morning I walked out of the store with a 40inch Samsung model 40b640.The tv was only 2 weeks on the market and only had been in best buy for 2 weeks, but I was told it had sold like hotcakes, and told it was a great tv.I was able to exchange my sony purchase straight across the board for the samsung, and boy did I make a good decision.The Samsung is AWESOME. The contrast is 80,000 to 1. It has 4 hdmi ports. It has great sound. A rotating base. The tv is very light weight with a thinner construction compared to most other lcds(not including the new LED-LCDs). The remote is very easy to use & is back lit. The tv itself has a fresh/great look too it. The tv is very fairly priced, in fact I was shocked at the cheaper price. It wasnt on sale either...I put in Terminator 2 on bluray, and it was simply amazing how much more real, clear, and better it looked on this tv compared to not only the xbr6, but any other lcd that I have seen so far.I also watched an HDTV cable channel that I picked up with a rabbit ear antenna and just like with the T2 bluray disc, it also at times looked like I was doing the actual filming from behind the video camera...If you dont believe me, then please buy this tv and see for yourself...This tv is leaps & bounds above the sony xbr6 and considerably less in cost.Sorry Sony, but your poor quality on the xbr6 and failed handling of a serious consumer problem has led me to the competitor and I couldnt be happier at the moment...Sony, you need to remember something... Most people will stick with you & your product for years and years while supporting you, but when you do not address a problem correctly & stand behind your customers, then YOU WILL LOSE CUSTOMERS & YOU WILL HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM.I hope this review will get through too you...Thanks everyone for reading my review!!!", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "White screen & no support", "Author": "Dave Brown \"DB\"", "ReviewID": "RP0N8G9RVG0L4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For the first 6 months I was happy with this TV.

And the sound is excellent, especially when compared to Samsung.Update: I'm now trying to get Sony to replace the t.v.  It was repaired and delivered yesterday.  After watching it for about 5 minutes, the same problem happened....  No picture, no sound.  Needless to say, the only thing that will satisfy me now is receiving a new t.v.--------Here's the problem. I contacted Sony 8 weeks ago to explain the difficulty we were having, spent about 2 hours trying to fix it over the phone to no avail. I suggested they give me approval to get it serviced, but they insisted I wait for a USB software update in the mail.... 6 weeks later after 3 incorrect address delivery attempts and more customer service incompetence than you can possibly imagine, I finally received the software update (I had them overnight it). And of course, it didn't work.Next we move onto the service phase where I am now in a holding pattern. I needed to get a repair breakdown and service estimate from the technician, but he wouldn't give me one as he had no idea what was wrong with the t.v.: \"No picture. No sound. Huh? Only turn on/off....\" Now I am waiting to talk to his manager to get some document I can fax back to Sony along with all the receipts in order for them to approve repair service.In summary, our t.v. has not worked for well over a month, I have wasted well over five hours talking to incompetent Sony representatives over the phone, and I have little hope of having a working t.v. anytime soon.

Things were \"OK\" but not what others had described - such as the great surround sound effects, and the almost 3D visual effects in some instances.

Ceva did a good job, but the guy told me that he wasn't supposed to help me to mount the TV on my stand. Whatever the TV picture is spectacular; there are no words to describe exactly the picture quality, I live in a condominium where the TV signal from Comcast is free, the picture quality is great but note that you get 3 different kinds of signal when you have cable; analog, digital 480 and HD 1080i and the analog and digital makes a big difference, I repeat a big difference, now HD channels are awesome, completely breathtaking incredible....and Then I connect my indoor  HD amplified Terk antenna and that's almost another word the image is perfect , incredible perfect.  But the day after I received my TV I found on the hallway one of the cable company techs and I asked him about the signal quality from his company and we started talking about their service, the guy was very nice telling me ...never order cable service if you have a HD TV only use Satellite company , because the quality it's so obvious , he told me that the cable signal lose quality thru the cable instead of satellite everything is thru the air and the signal is 100%  digital and 100 % HD. That's why I'm ordering direct TV.  But I do recommend this TV to anyone looking for the best TV and the best quality TV, why I put it this way?  Because I started doing my research to buy a TV like 6 months ago and I found that the best picture quality is with Samsung series 600,700 and 800. BUT there is so many complaining about quality, like features that doesn't work as promised, the frame peeling off etc etc  and Sony  Bravia processors make the image looks so great in standard signal or HD. BECAUSE when you are shopping around for a HD TV in your local stores note that almost all TVs looks great, almost every single one have great picture , WHY?  Because those are connect to a HD air antenna, Satellite or Blu ray (which those 3 are HD signals) but when you take it home,  the history is 100 % different because in the real world we don't have all the channels in HD the majority are standard digital signal. That's why a good TV and a good TV processor are extremely important, the capacity of the TV to make those standard definition channels look like HD channels, most of the HD TVs now, the picture looks excellent in HD signal, but when you watch standard channels on a HD TV is the biggest test your TV will pass or not and believe me most of the TV out there look terrible in Standard definition, because the processor of the TV doesn't have the capability to upscale the signal near to 1080i. Tell the salesman to connect the TV you are interest in to an standard definition  signal and you will see that he will tell you that they don't have standard definition signal in that store.  And be realistic.... You can find out there a  40'' TV for 649.00 but also there some TVs that's cost $6,716.23 or like the Sony XBR7 40 that the price list is 2,100.00 but you can get it here in Amazon for 1,400.00, Why there is such price difference in TVs ? Because technology cost, you get what you pay  , if you want quality you have to pay for it, if you don't believe  me , look right now for the cheapest TV here in Amazon . Recapping...you want the best picture? , well my best advised for you is to go for Sony but also get ready with your wallet because their best ones are expensive. Also I bought this TV because the price was the same that the XBR6 40. And the XBR7 have even a better processor and a woofer not a sub woofer.

Maybe I should have purchased Samsung, which Consumer Reports rates as the best LCD, or a lower end Sony 40\" without the XBR features.", "Date": "February 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV but lousy delivery!", "Author": "Lloyd Kennedy", "ReviewID": "R24NCGGPZNMN9A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I order the Sony Bravia XBR KDL-40XBR6 40-Inch TV. The price was great particularly when the $400 off when a DVD was with it.

Well The driver of the delivery showed up, alone, I do not think he could speak english, carried the big tv in his arms, dumped it inside the front door and left. Since I am on oxygen I could not eve move it. I had to hire someone to move it and set it in place.

I was using my old CRT before and the games looked great already but since hooking it up to a 1080p set (with HDMI of course), I am sold on HDTV. The tv was fairly simple to set up. I don't have cable so scanning for signals to about 20min for me. The speakers are a better than my old CRT but I've set up a sound system for movies and gaming. The cross media bar (menu) is easy to navigate and the remote control has a layout that is similar to controls of the past so it wasn't confusing to use. I've played the same movie on my XBR (blu-ray & dvd), and I'm sold on the blu-ray format. Upconverted images looked better then dvds but they are certainly no substitute for true HD. My recommendation is: if anyone plans to get a 1080p tv, then they should also opt for a blu-ray player otherwise you'll not get the full HD experience. Why shell out more for 1080p true HD when 720p sets are much cheaper? Am I right? I'm completely satisfied with this tv and it should last me until the next generation of tv viewing arrives.

I read a number of professional reviews but I really valued the customer feedback to give me the bottom line as a user.  I wanted a 40\" set and found the choice really come down to the Sony KDL40XBR6 and the Samsung LN40A650. I went to see them both and was pleased with the picture and features (like the 120 hz refresh rate) of each. I settled on the Sony because of the quality reputation and my wife being Japanese, has a strong belief in Japanese brand (although not necessarily made there) products. Price point was about $250 more for the Sony but I felt justified because of the brand. I wanted a HDTV that was simple to set up and simple to control. Set up was easy and the HD image is great. Compared to an old CRT set the controls take a little time to learn but are not overwhelming. I have my old standard Panasonic DVD player connected with a S-video cable and DVD image quality is very good too.

Sadly, I had to return a 40V2500 even though a 46V2500 model I still own remains curiously very satisfactory. The 40XBR6 is a step up in terms of features to readjust the picture to your liking. I am not impressed thus far. The quality of the screen (besides playing a blu-ray disc) is under my expectation (almost like a W4100) by a big margin. That is, edges (moving objects) are still fuzzy at times, contrast is not very strong, colors are a tad like those of a Sharp LCD, grainy background would go away w/ enhanced noise reduction which takes away sharpness overall. If u previously have a 720p Olivia, this XBR will satisfy you. but after being owner of a Samsung LN 52A630, a W4100, 2 V2500, and a slew of Olevia and Sharp LCD, this XBR 40-inch is disapointing. Larger screen technology (more than 40-inch) tends to provides faster resolution for fuzzy edge, with improved details, I think. Hence, I recommend this TV as a 4+ stars if only u can get a larger screen. As a 40\" this TV stays at 3.5 stars (there is no way to do 3 and half star via Amazon tool) for its rather high pricetag.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect", "Author": "WSC \"Captain\"", "ReviewID": "R11SMOEJXY3VT8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV performed flawlessly.

When they brought the box out from the warehouse, I was shocked to find that the box was covered with a thick layer of dust.  The upper corner of the box near the handle was severely torned, possibly caused by rough handling.  I took a chance by accepting it and made note of the damage on the delivery paper.
