{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Deal!", "Author": "Zanderdog", "ReviewID": "R1RPEAVN93LA7S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: * Extremely large: 55 Inches* Bright: 450 nit* Standard Inputs, including HDCP-compliant HDMI. Standard power cable: C13-C14 10-15A* Low power footprint from LED backlight: 135w peak* Respectable contrast and gamma out of the box, easily optimized.* Overscan can be completely disabled, independently of the aspect ratio setting (Menu, video, advanced, Overscan: Off)* Superb price for the performance. This is probably the single biggest benefit. You can't get a set this big at this price from anyone else.* Will take a 4:4:4 RGB signal without incident (may not disable it as 4:4:4, haven't checked yet)* Works great with HTPCs, at least ones with AMD GPUs. No HDCP handshake issues, resolution detection issues, or other common Display-Chain issues.* Relatively low latency for having 120Hz smoothing. I estimate about 30-40ms.* Default sharpness value is zero, no sharpening occurs. Can be negative (if you wanted to blur the display I suppose)* Thin!Cons: * 120 Hz smoothing cannot be disabled (maybe a hidden menu, but the standard UI doesn't have an option for it).* Backlight cannot be controlled. (NOTE:\"Brightness\" adjusts the white point, not the backlight). This means it will always run at FULL; much brighter than needed in an intimate setting.* No user-upgradable firmware. USB-port is for technicians only.* OSD/GUI is minimal, missing many higher-end calibration options. NO CONFIG FOR: Gamma, Backlight, RGB-Gains, CMY-Tints* 120 Hz panel cannot be supplied a 120 Hz signal because the input board doesn't support higher than 60 Hz (Extremely common, not a complaint but an industry criticism)* DOES NOT SUPPORT 24 Hz INPUT. Only option for 24 Hz content is to do a Reverse-3:2 pulldown, then double to 120 Hz.* Very thick bezel, more than an inch.* Flashlighting in corners, not perfectly even (common problem for edge-lit models) but no worse than the competitionOther Thoughts: I normally prefer big-name manufacturers for displays, but I thought I would take a gamble and give Coby a try. I'm glad I did! The LEDTV5536 is a great value. It works great with my stereo and my HTPC. No dead pixels, no physical damage.I've watched several of my favorite films on the LEDTV5536 now. If you are a film purist, this isn't the unit for you. The Reverse-3:2 followed by smoothing to 120Hz causes subtle artifacts on long straight lines (e.g. windows borders on cityscapes, telephone lines, automobile intake grilles.) or during some shots of fast motion.On a positive note, the 120 Hz smoothing produces some of the most lifelike motion I've ever seen from 24 Hz film content. I watched Kubrick's \"Eyes Wide Shut\", and the many closeups during conversation looked almost real.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "NO GOOD", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "RO3J3WF3FG7H2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THIS TV WAS HORRIBLE.

I got the tv and mounted it on the wall and all I got was a fuzzy picture. I found that other people had similar problems and nothing but bad things to say about the TV. Also there is a reason that the Contrast Ratio isn't posted because Coby has one of the worst Contrast Ratios on the market. Tried multiple HDMI cables and nothing helped. Shipped the TV back which was even more of the problem. The driver didn't come to pick up the TV like they had promised and after being on hold with CEVA Transport for more than an hour I eventually called Amazon Customer Service who called and made a Ceva driver come to my house at 10 PM to pick up the TV. Moral of the story... Don't buy a large TV online. Go to best buy and get a Samsung open box tv regularly $1399 for $757 and you will be much happier.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not purchase from this company", "Author": "S. Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R3D96DAW3C7OBP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There is NO customer service for this company. I received a COBY television as a present, however, there was an issue with the sound. The sound on the tv did not go very high and therefore I wanted to contact customer service to see if there was an upgrade or something I could do to fix it. I called the number that is listed on their website (877-302-2629) and it is just an automated recording that tells you for customer support, go to the website. I emailed the \"technical assistance\" and to this day, have STILL not heard back. I sent another email today and doubt I will get a response. I also went onto their Facebook page, which specifically had to state that they do not handle any customer service issues. There is a customer service tab on their FB page that leads to NOTHING. If you read the ALL of the comments on items that have been posted on FB, it is ALL complaints from people about broken products and non existent customer service. It is very disappointing that this company is able to treat customers the way they do.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap", "Author": "William", "ReviewID": "R2CIYKOWVLAZRI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got it on black friday deals. it was ~$600 for a 55\" tv. good deal I learned that the tv has some bad bleed through from the LEDs and the colors are bad. I spent a few hours tuning them trying to get them normal. By default every face glows orange. It would also have been nice if you could turn down the 120 Hz to 60. Some of my family doesn't like the soap opera effect. Also one note. The TV doesn't seem to handle movement very well. If a person is walking semi quickly the background an inch around the person gets offset. In other scenes this doesn't happen.....", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Coby TV Good Value", "Author": "Amazon Buyer", "ReviewID": "R3UPZQJDW5H2DF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Coby LED 5536 is a good value. The sound is not great - most buyers would probably install their own surround system anyway. The picture is great. When the screen goes dark, you can see some white areas I presume are caused by the LED lights. When the screen is bright with activity the picture is great so it does not hinder the viewing experience a great deal.

Once I actually got the freight service to let me unpack and plug in the TV to test it, half of the screen was dead.  I refused delivery and am awaiting the ridiculousness long refund process with amazon; I buy a $700 TV which doesn't work and they want me to wait two weeks for a refund, even after they confirmed with the freight service that it was in fact damaged and on its way back to the warehouse.  Seriously this TV is not worth the hassle and I should have realized that from the get go.
