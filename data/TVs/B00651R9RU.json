{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The BEST LCD under $600", "Author": "K", "ReviewID": "R2KRVNEVW904EH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second LCD TV, my main TV was a Samsung 37\" which I love. I just wanted to have a TV in my room so I moved the Samsung to my room and bought the Vizio for my living room.It's fantastic. I'm pretty technical and I like to research anything I buy to ensure I'm getting a great product for the right price. So this was my search criteria:- 42\" diagonal- 120Hz- 1080p (optional, 720p on this size would be the same)- Energy Star (important for me)- I wanted it for everyday use but also for gaming (PS3)- Under $600So I searched every one of the usual places WalMart, Sams, Costco, BJs, Target, Amazon, Sears, Best Buy, etc...I narrowed it down to this one, an LG 42LD450 and the Vizio M421NV (LED). They were all great, but side by side, Vizio was better than the LG. The LG had some issues with text (you could see some offset lines around the text, kind of annoying). Also, the video quality was smoother, cleaner, the whites were better looking as well as the blacks. The Vizio LED was great. Initially I was going to get this one, but honestly, the image quality was about the same as this Vizio LCD, and the LED costs like $75 over the LCD. In fact, I remember noticing the image a bit smoother on the LCD and the whites were more whites. The LED's looked yellowish (It might've been a setting at the store though; I don't want to discredit the LED, it's still a great looking TV)In the end, I chose this because it was cheaper (I paid 578 for it in Walmart), the quality is amazing, the Energy Star rating is 5.3 (better than the 4.0 on the LED model) and as an added perk it has the wifi apps (not that I cared about that, but it's kinda cool if you have Netflix).So yeah, this is a fantastic TV. In my opinion, the best out there for this price range. Audio quality is great as well (even though I use my Bose system for sound, the TV's sound is great). It's really worth it, I love it so much I'm writing a review about it.-K", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vizio 42\" - Loving it", "Author": "Darkwolfe", "ReviewID": "RY3FPLGH4BHUR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I bought this TV last night. We've tried to test out every option including the WiFi and USB connection. So far everything has been really good.We tested the USB and screen picture by loading an HD version of 300 (Blu-Ray) from my PC onto a USB drive and plugging it into the TV. It worked beautifully, and played smoothly even in .mp4 format.The WiFi hooked up easily and has allowed the TV to update it's firmware automatically, and I assume will auto-update any future apps like an iphone would. Tested out videos on Hulu through the TV's WiFi and even logged on to Facebook.It was just over $500 at Walmart. Set up smoothly and has a great picture.The only drawback is that it's a bit top-heavy. It has a security cable included but has to have a wall-anchor set into the wall for it to be stabilized with the security cable. If that's not an issue, great TV!", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pleased , but for a tiny issue", "Author": "Tom L.", "ReviewID": "R3EAGWVWNVEGUG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV was a gift for my mother and step-father's anniversary. i hooked everything up and was , well we all were absolutely stunned as to the incredible picture. I have a HD TV  and my pic on my Sony wasnt as sharp., The only thing that was a slight let-down and will have to be remedied is that my parents dont see so well anymore .....I can only hope one is available through Vizio. I have not honestly looked as of yet. The only other thing is that we really were looking forward to having the YouTube widget .....apparently it is NOT available as of yet , but there is considerable internet gossip of it coming soon. Overall. we are all extremely pleased as it was the best value for the money!!!!!!", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "WoW", "Author": "Carlos Cavazos", "ReviewID": "ROIMEZWROUISK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome picture.

We purchased this tv back on March 16, 2012 after having a Samsung tv go out, we had it less than 4 years I guess. 2-3 days ago(june 2013) this Vizio TV started turning itself off. This happens every 20-25 minutes, we turn it back on only to keep this process up through out our viewing. Needless to say warranty is out. We did get an ext warranty thru our credit card but now we have to decide is it worth getting repaired. How do we decide on brand this time? Either way this tv should have lasted longer than 15 months. Vizio guesses it is the power board that has went out?? if so, that part is 150.00. Our ext warranty is not written in stone, it is the discretion of the credit card co...it can take 7-10 business days to decide if they fix it or not. NOT a happy customer of the Vizio name. This tv was not purchased thru Amazon. It was purchase at our local Wal... store.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Tv...Kinda sucks usb keyboard don't work...", "Author": "dmusket", "ReviewID": "R16P3J3YBY72VB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well the tv is ok...
