{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Pleased With This Sharply-Focused TV", "Author": "Beth Fox \"Beth A. Fox\"", "ReviewID": "R2WB6C2AE9FP24", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this TV monitor for six months now, and I am delighted with my purchase.  I had been searching for a flat-screen TV that was reasonably-priced and had a good, sharp picture.  I compared this TV in a store to several others in its price range.  This was the clear winner.  It has a beautiful picture and great sound. (I am pleased that my TV has no dead pixels, either.)This is a monitor, not a TV, so you do need a cable box.  I have a digital HD box through Adelphia cable.  The HD channels on this TV are outstanding.  The persons on screen might as well be standing in front of you.  I have never tried to use this as a computer monitor, so I cannot speak to how it would work, but it is a wonderful TV.  And, despite Westinghouse's reputation for having bad remotes, the remote control on this TV works well.  It is very easy to switch from HDTV to regular TV.All in all, I am delighted.  My only regret is not having bought a larger Westinghouse TV -- but that would have meant paying much more!", "Date": "February 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Other reviewers don't do it justice", "Author": "Agata", "ReviewID": "R1VP5F5I17MFB8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV, and I am very pleased with it. I did not expect fancy features and surround-like sound, but a basic LCD TV that was inexpensive and expandable. I actually like the fact that it doesn't have a built-in HDTV tuner - that lets the price stay low (I will call up my cable company to upgrade to HDTV in a few days). Without HDTV, the picture quality isn't the best when you're close up, but with HDTV (as I saw in the store) it's just as great as the more expensive brands. The salesman told me how customers come back and complain about the picture quality, but this kind of TV is made to be used with HDTV (evident with the display model they had). The sound isn't bad - it's good enough for this price (for reviewers who complain about this - you get what you pay for, and if you want better sound quality, go for a more expensive model). My set has no dead pixels at all, and unlike what others said, the remote works fine. The menu can get a bit confusing to use, but it's manageable. The documentation is minimal, but you can probably find more info on it online. Overall, I am very happy for finding an LCD for such a low price (I went to J&R; for it - great service, the set is priced at $799.99 in store and $699.99 on their site, they were happy to give it to me for the online price). I recommend it for people who really want an LCD but can't afford one over $1,000. I'm looking forward to getting HDTV, and enjoying years with this LCD TV.", "Date": "May 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Looks nice...sounds AWFUL..", "Author": "Jennifer A. Bogucki", "ReviewID": "RB6HW8MF4GL77", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just purchased & RETURNED this tv.  We were thrilled when we took it out of the box..until we set it up.  The sound is AWFUL.  The sound waves from very low to extremely loud - so loud that it actually makes a popping noise.  And, no it wasn't only when commercials came on - it is continuous.  Unfortunately for us I did not do any sort of research before purchasing the tv.  Now that I've put in a couple of searches on this tv, I see that I wasn't the only person who  had issues with the sound.  It seems to be the #1 complaint on this model.  It is unfortunate because Westinghouse is a good name brand. We did return this set and purchase a slightly more expensive model that is not a Westinghouse.  Hope this helped out.", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "One of my best purchases", "Author": "NJ Whitey", "ReviewID": "RSCDBHGA7GNY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this television 4 years ago this month and it does not have a dead pixel yet, and the picture is as good as the day I bought it.  I'm completely satisfied with it.  DVDs look great on it.Some of the other reviewers knock it for the sound, but flatscreens aren't known for their sound.  They're designed to be used with a stereo or surround sound system.I am updating this review today, Jan 1, 2013 to indicate that approx 1 yr ago every time the tv was turned on, the screen wouldn't come on for a few minutes.  As time went on it got worse (after a few minutes of the screen being on, it would go black) so I just left it on.  About 4 months ago, a big dark spot (about the diameter of a soda can) appeared in the upper left corner.  About 1.5 mos ago, the tv died completely.  So I had it in perfect operating condition for about 6.5 years.A good tv while it lasted.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome PC Moniter!", "Author": "Jennifer Scott \"Jennifer\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z33XB0B104F9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this in 2007 and hooked it up as my TV and PC Moniter (because it has a VGA connection) It has never caused me a problem.
