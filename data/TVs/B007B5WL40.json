{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This kind of picture for under $300?", "Author": "TonyK", "ReviewID": "R1M08D7OK74EWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for my room at school and my roommate and I decided on something in the 30-36\" range. We found we could either get a refurbished model from a big brand like Sony or Sharp for about $220, or a new model from a no-name brand like Haier or others that I can't even remember then I found this model for about $270 with free shipping.In short:-The LED picture is stunning, the blacks are very deep and the colors aren't washed out like many Samsung models I've seen.-Standard definition TV programming looks pretty grainy, although the cable quality in my building isn't the best. Playing standard definition video games or watching standard definition DVDs looks very sharp and detailed.-It is only 720p but on a screen this size it doesn't make a huge difference.-Motion blur isn't good, it's refresh rate is only 60Hz, but it isn't annoying.-The settings assistant Philips uses makes it so easy to get a good picture setup from the start. They split the screen down the middle and show the same picture with different settings applied and you choose which looks better.-The Sound is really impressive, especially from a TV this size/cost and considering the speakers are mounted in the back. If you mess around with the equalizer and turn the bass up a bit you get a rich, clear sound.-Not that it matters for dorm living but its estimated energy usage is $6 a year based on watching 5 hours a day.-Finally, the touch-sensitive buttons on the front are really cool and they are very responsive.Overall this is a very high quality TV at an unbelievable price. Amazon has been ordering 15-20 at a time and selling out within a week. If it's in stock don't hesitate.", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "great for price", "Author": "dominic richert", "ReviewID": "ROZG387I2EDSR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i bought this tv at Sams club for 280. the design is really nice i think. it works great in my bedroom with an xbox, cable, and a computer connected. the speakers are great. the picture is as good as any i have seen on tvs, especially when using it for a monitor", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great second room tv", "Author": "Poetry in Motion", "ReviewID": "R2W4DEG3V1Q465", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with this tv. It has a bright and detailed picture and clear sound, allows even lower tones to be heard in movies that have a wide sound varience. I have only owned it for 1 month, so I can't speak to it's durability, but it seems as well made as any other flat screen in its price range that I have owned. I like the energy star features, and it has no annoying lights on the front panel -- an important feature for a bedroom tv.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "M1SA", "ReviewID": "R1XEXXD7ARA1NP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All I use the tv for is for Gaming on the Xbox 360 and occasional movies. The picture is crisp and sharp. With an hdmi cable, the picture is epic. Most of these comments are rediculous. Rating the tv bad because you can't use a USB? Seriously? Who uses a tv for it's USB? Can't delete channels? Get direct tv or cable service.Get this tv. It's a great tv for its class and the price is right!", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Deceptive Advertising: USB video playback does not work. Now I question if the tv will last", "Author": "Traveler \"Duke\"", "ReviewID": "R3RXJAC5GGZ06C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Philips 32PFL4507 USB video playback is just marketing to get one to buy the TV.  The USB Video only supports an OLD and Unique format called Motion JPEG with AVI extension (MJPEG.AVI).  I downloaded 5 different free and paid video converters and none support the unique Philips video format.  I've sent emails to Philips and two different paid video converter software companies.  Will let all know if I get any resolution.  If I don't, I'll return this TV for a Samsung which cost more but has broad support for video playback.That said here are the following Pros:1. Outstanding picture contrast, sharpness, and quality2. Good audio...good base and choices for mixing3. Love the audio output jack!!!!  This tv is in bedroom so I just plug in my wireless headphones and bam I can play as loud as I want without waking the kids!!!!4. Light weight so setting on economy furniture not a problem5. can be wall mounted6. 3 HDMI inputs....for the price and quality this is unusual cause most only have 2 HDMIs7. Easy setup, but most TVs are now days8. Nice and easy screen setup steps that are all visual so what you see is what you get.July 10, 2012 UPDATEContacted Philips who stated they do not have the software and do not recommend converter software.I finally found software that does convert the files to MJPEG.avi 320 x 240....However the TV still comes up with \"Format Not Supported.\"  I give up.Philips engaged in deceptive marketing of their video playback.  It does not work and not even Philips knows software that can make it work.Bottome line:  Don't buy.July 11, 2012 UPDATEFrom a phone call with Philips Technical rep:1.  How to \"delete\" channels:  While true one cannot \"delete\" a channel, one can \"skip\" any channel.  From the Menu, go to the \"channel list,\" select the channel to skip, puts \"OK\" and it should fade.  Now exit out of the menu and scroll through your channels.  No \"skip\" channels appear.  It works great!2.  Technical rep said he had never tried to show video on the USB.  Said he would research.  He also suggested using a PC playback etc.  While I can to this, I don't want to since Philips states the video will playback.  Simply put, I want the thing to work as advertised.Now the Cons:1.  No video converter for the OLD and Unique video format: MJPEG with avi extension2.  No way to label inputs (note: Philips calls these \"sources\" on the remote)3.  USB port on back and side of the flat screen so if wall mounted make sure you get a USB extension4.  Audio jack also on the back and side so again not cool for wall mounted use5.  Since 60HZ, fast motion distortion can be seenMy reference for picture quality and sound include one Sony 55\", two 42\" Panasonic plasmas, one 32\" Samsung LCD.  Of these, I still love the Sony!  Panasonics are great and Samsung very good.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "An a-plus deal", "Author": "Vera L.

Although, it has a USB port video playback via USB with certain formats. Also the USB and audio input are on the backside of the T.V., which if mounted on a wall, makes it very hard to use.

Backlight uniformity issues make LCD/LED a poor option right now as i noticed after having this tv for a week. i will wait a year or 2 until the led technology gets perfected before making a purchase.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "STAY AWAY - DO NOT BUY FROM PHILIPS", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R3TFCYHS5B6THS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A letter to Philips regarding my 40PFL3706Dear Philips Entitlement Department.How telling that I am writing to a \"Department\" and have not had the courtesy to deal with a person that would take some sort of real responsibility in caring for a Philips customer and ensuring that the customer is left satisfied and happy with their product.Frankly, I've never thought much of Philips as a brand, good nor bad.And now, after an incredibly distasteful experience I have quite an impression.The Philips brand is now engrained in my mind as a company whose product is I should steer clearly away from and one I should warn my friends and family to stay away from.And if anyone crosses my path that insists on buying Philips, I will surely warn them of the sneaky warranty that qualifies a factory certified \"remanufactured\" product as a replacement.To get a new product that has problems upon coming out of its package is disappointing enough, but to then to go through hoops to resolve the issue with a customer service department that is completely detached from its end user is exhausting, frustrating, and a waste of time.How pathetic that your warranty does not view \"cosmetic damage - as incompletion of the warranty\". What does that mean?That's like saying that you buy a brand new car to find out that their are issues with the motor and so you return it to get a new car and you are given a car that has a motor that works but the doors are keyed and scratched.At this point, I look forward to the first opportunity to replace my Philips TV simply just not to have the reminder of this ridiculous experience in my living room.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "NO DVD/BLU-RAY INCLUDED", "Author": "Readsalot", "ReviewID": "R202RZV87K6DWD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Information given for this TV does not tell you the slot for DVD/Blu-ray disks is not included.

The good points:  small, lightweight, intuitively obvious to operate, decent picture.  The bad points: everything else.

NOTHING WORKED.  Motion JPEG? REALLY?!!!!  Does anyone know ANYONE who uses this format?  My next pet peeve is that you can't delete channels you don't want to watch.  What?  This TV was designed and constructed in 2012 and you can't delete channels from the channel list?  Who made this TV?  A caveman?  If all you want/need is a small TV with a decent picture that changes volume and channels (i.e., the most basic TV on Earth), this puppy is for you...but if you want a TV that does even a little more, you'd be better off buying a refrigerator.
