It has decent specs and a great price. The problem is with the quality. I had mine for six weeks before it died, and it's now been \"in the shop\" for six weeks.I won't bore you with all the details, but I'll hit the high-points. I purchased the TV locally and it died within six weeks. I called Polaroid who told me I had to call their \"warranty administrator\" Prima Worldwide Warranty. I called them and waited on hold for 45 minutes (which I found out is a normal wait time after having called them about seven times now). It took a week to even get the TV picked up for service. They told me I'd have it back within 7-10 days.That was six weeks ago. I've called the repair shop, who tells me I'll have it back in 5 days (and they've been telling me this for weeks now). I called PWW and got frustrated after waiting on hold for an hour! I called Polaroid and they told me there was nothing they could do. What customer service!!!So, don't be fooled by the great specs and low price. It's not worth the frustration of having to deal with Polaroid's terrible customer service. (On a side note, I was told by the repair place that if it was a Sony TV they would have shipped a brand new one to me within four business days. Now that's a company who cares about their customers, a concept Polaroid has yet to grasp.)", "Date": "January 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "What you pay is what you get", "Author": "Beantown Jim", "ReviewID": "R3DZ7X0J4UCPGG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The monitor(not a TV; it has no tuner) is fine with a satellite service which precludes your TV tuner anyway.  It had a small hiccup(flaw) for a few days; by the time customer service called, it had mysteriously cured itself.  Like computers, today's TV's sometimes just need the power strip turned off for a re-set.  Anyway, the price was excellent, the picture comparable to any other, the weight extraordinary(light) for a 37\" set, etc.  Plus, it can serve as a giant(37\") computer monitor.  Only shortcomings are speed of service and no p-i-p.", "Date": "May 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "6 years old and still going strong", "Author": "Jordan Bennett", "ReviewID": "R32YZFWP1TNR97", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this T.V. for six years, now, and it's still a beauty. I watch this T.V. and average of four hours a day and the picture looks just as good as the day I bought it (for $2000!). I can't review the sound as I always used a receiver and external speakers but the picture quality is amazing considering the technological advancements made since it first came out. The only flaw in this T.V. are the black levels. They are definately not plasma quality. The only other problem is that you need an HDMI to DVI cord if you want to use anything HDMI related because, back then, I don't think HDMI was invented. If you can find a lightly used one, it's worth the cheap price tag.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broken screen my tv worked well for 4 yrs. till wii controler hit screen if you have a bad set contact me at lholdgrafer@yahoo.c", "Author": "Mr. Louis Holdgrafer", "ReviewID": "RRTUMULI018FT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "tv worked well with game systems and tv tuner for 4 yrs. untill controler hit the screen. would recommend this to anyone.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "37\" widescreen LCD HDTV display\n1080i/720p/480p/480i digital compatibility\n3\n2 and 2\n2 pull-down with motion compensation", "Name": "Polaroid FLM-3701 37-Inch Widescreen LCD HDtv Monitor", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31EK898S37L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000B640L8"}}
