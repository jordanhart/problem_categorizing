{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Adorable tv but watch the price", "Author": "TigardGal", "ReviewID": "R1LQG5MNCSCKMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this tv for my daughter's room and it works great.  The picture is good quality and the sound works great for the size of her room.  If the room was bigger we might want to look at a getting a sound bar, but for the average size bedroom it should do the job just fine.  Just a couple things to note.  The Hello Kitty head has to be attached but it went on with ease, but the paws come attached.  They say that you can remove the head if you don't want it, but I didn't see how the paws come off easily?  And the other thing it to be careful what you pay... I believe this is a Target exclusive item and we got it on sale for under $100.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GTXL07Y"}}
