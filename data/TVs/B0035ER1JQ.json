{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just ok... and I returned it", "Author": "Jose Chavarri", "ReviewID": "RK5BD02RP9I5P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In my experience, this tv is just ok, while I expect Sony products to be the best. The menu structure, the remote, the apps (I really don't know why every manufacturer keeps putting an internet connection in their tvs - my blu-ray, has it, my PS3 and Xbox360, too - why do I need to pay for this duplicate function?), the thin design and the build are all right. The image quality is clearly imperfect, however.First, the blacks have a clear blue tinge. I think it's because of the LED side illumination, because my old XBR4 didn't have this defect.Second, the viewing angle is bad. As soon as yoy stray from a central viewing position, the blacks begin to wash out significantly. From about a 45 degree angle they become a blueish-gray mess.I thought I could live with this nuisances, but my tv developed a dead pixel in a week, so I decided to return it. Amazon's service was, of course, top notch.In exchange I bought a (cheaper) Bravia EX500. In my opinion the image quality is clearly better, beacause of deeper blacks and the perfect viewing angles. I noticed a little more motion blur and you lose the thin frame, the Xross menu system and the internet connection, but I can trade these for image quality anytime.Now I see you can get the 40' EX700 at $749 everywhere, I guess nobody is buying.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "More than I bargained for!", "Author": "ericesque", "ReviewID": "R2LV3PWS2FRRQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony is known for the quality of their screens.  This model does not disappoint. Colors are vibrant, but not oversaturated like some brands.  The image clarity is exactly what you'd expect from a quality HD set.While the TV already connected to many popular online video, music, and photo services when I bought it, I was especially pleased that Sony pushed out an update which provided Hulu Plus support. It feels like Christmas when something you already paid for gets new features!The only thing I'm not crazy about is the remote.  It seems over engineered. Fortunately I use a universal remote and was able to configure the buttons in a way that made more sense to me.  This 'flaw' was not significant enough to knock the rating down.Other thoughts: If you are buying an HDTV for the first time, buy a size up from what you think you want. Having owned this 40\" for four months, I would have gone 42\" or even 46\" if I had it to do over.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent!!!", "Author": "Albert in San Jose", "ReviewID": "RI3N35XQ2M8MO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Shopped around a lot for a new LCD LED TV, and did extensive online research but it was difficult to judge actual picture quality from online information.I saw this model on display at Best Buy and was amazed by the picture, and I was intrigued by the internet video capabilities.  So, I bought the EX700 on Amazon and saved money.  Fast free delivery, box arrived in great condition. The picture quality is nothing short of superb. Satellite HD broadcasts are ultra sharp with excellent color tones. The backlight feature, which is adjustable, really enhances the picture quality. BluRay movie picture quality is the absolute ultimate. You have to see it to appreciate it.The TV itself weighs around 40 pounds and was easy to mount on the wall using a universal flat panel TV mount from my old TV.I also bought the Sony USB Wi-Fi adapter. Plugged it into the USB on the side of the TV, where the TV immediately sensed it. I selected auto-scan from the setup menu and the adapter quickly located my wireless network, then prompted me for my network password. I entered the password and voila! Access to Netflix, Amazon Video on Demand, Hulu, internet radio, etc., etc. This process took about 2 or 3 minutes.Using internet video services has really enhanced our viewing options. Everyone in my household just loves it.This is an awesome TV on it's own merits - and for the money, it's an absolute bargain.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "How Sony Got its Groove Back", "Author": "lifeofthefuneral", "ReviewID": "RSJYOS047QP9R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony has always been a pretty \"go-to brand\", but lately, it has been pretty sub-par to the rest. Not only are they expensive, but don't offer the quality that say a Sharp or Samsung may offer.I've had this TV about 2 months now and it is AWESOME!You may be skeptical to buy a Sony, as was I, but this TV was a steal. I got it after I bought and returned 2 Vizio Razor LED M420NVs. They both the same problem, bright spots during black screen. I got this for $750 and never looked back.Pros:-Vibrant colors-Superior image clarity-Beautiful user interface for apps-Excellent sound quality-4 HDMI ports-USB 2.0 port-Presence sensor saves power when nobody is in roomCons:-Doesn't make you dinner-Doesn't walk the dogs or get the kids ready for schoolIf you can get this TV for under $800...DO IT!

The picture quality (720) was SUPERB. The ONLY reason we started shopping around for a new LCD was the amount of HEAT emitted by this TV, which made our bedroom uncomfortable after a couple hours..... Like a typical LCD (and I guess Plasma too) these products heat up and in the Summer are adding to the room temperature...I went to our neighborhood store, spent some time watching the pictures and checking the amount of heat coming out from both the screen and the back of each TV. This Sony was by far the best combination of VERY little heat, with GREAT picture.... The \"Edge LED\" technology is the one to produce the least amount of heat, I'm told.The picture is truly great in the sense of CONTRAST, deep black, and rich colors. As far as SHARPNESS, I can't swear it is any better than our \"old\" Toshiba....The one complaint I have is -- the manual is extremely poor, and short in details, which forced me to call Sony, on a Saturday afternoon, talk to India, get an agent who was reading from her book...I might also note that the guy at the store was telling me I can get online with this product (Ethernet cable attaches to the back), and don't need my laptop to do that no more.... Well, NOT EXACTLY.... I can get on some SPECIFIC sites, which Sony pre-choses for its customers, like YouTube and couple others (I haven't explored it yet), but CERTAINLY not use this TV as my laptop replacement for surfing the net.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "I'm loving it!", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "RTYRYO0MWG7PZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After years and years of waiting for prices to drop on Sony Bravia tv's, I bumped into a sale for several of these within my price range. I read all the reviews for the list of Bravia's I was looking at, and the main problem people had with this tv was that for the first 1 minute of turning the tv on you can't use the remote to tell the tv to do anything .. like change the channel or the volume or whatever. After receiving the tv, I found this to be true but it's something that isn't really a big deal. The picture is clear, crisp, is great for gaming, and I haven't ever regretted spending the $700 on this purchase. The only problem I had with this purchase was the choice of shipper they decided to use. The shipper was some small company that I've never heard of before and they wouldn't come out to my apartment to deliver the package because I didn't own a phone at the time. It took weeks of email negotiations before I found out from this company why my tv was never delivered to me. Eventually I borrowed one of my friend's cell phones and was able to call this horrible shipping company and wait for 5 hours in front of my apartment complex for them to stop by that same day and deliver my tv. Great product - horrible choice of shipper.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "sony bravia ex 700 series 40 inch led,lcd", "Author": "redfox0220", "ReviewID": "REHRTWE7FUI4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a great tv,I read the reviews and that made me deciede to buy the tv,great picture the color,and cairty are great.I would recomend this tv.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "WI FI READY means go back to the store and spend another $80", "Author": "gus octel \"gus\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZMX1X9U2FZUB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although the quality of the tv is outstanding, the blatant lie about WIFI ready is too much.All over the box it says WIFI ready.  get it home only to find out that ONLY SONY $80 usb chip will give you the wireless.Lies in advertising.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "TV is not responding to the remote control", "Author": "J.
