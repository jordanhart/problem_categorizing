{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easily the best TV of 2007 for the price", "Author": "J. D. Robinson \"KnottyMonkey\"", "ReviewID": "R3AC272Q9GP1UP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Moving to a new house and am buying two new flat panels for living room and bedroom.  I had assumed that LCD was the best technology currently available, but after a lot of careful research, found out about the new Samsung Plasmas, the 54/64 series in 50\" or 42\" sizes.WOW!  This is an amazing set.  I am very picky about what I buy, but at the same time try to spread my $ around so that I can have decent components for everything.  This TV is in the sweet spot for bang for the buck.  I thought that I would really be missing out by not having a 1080p TV, but this thing is truly amazing.I am running an HD Tivo from DirecTV (HDMI), an Xbox 360 (component), PS3 (component) and Wii (component).  They are all amazing, and for the money I saved on not getting 1080p or LCD, I am able to get a 4254 for the bedroom.The two main differences between this unit (5064) and the other model (5054) is that this one has a slightly stronger anti-glare shield and can view photos off of a USB stick.  If you have a 360, you won't likely use this functionality anyway.  The stronger anti-glare shield is great if you are putting this in a bright room with lots of windows, but if there is not going to be glare on the tv, go with the 54 series because the glass is clearer due to less heavy glare shield.  I will say that the glare shield is really great - my old rear projection Sony reflected every light in the room, this plasma doesn't reflect anything even with every light in the room on.The fit and finish is top notch, plenty of inputs including 3 HDMI and a PC input.  Take care to break your plasma in properly, don't watch too much SD tv with black bars during the first couple hundred hours, at least stretch the picture.  This TV is best suited for HD input, it looks fine on Standard Def, but that is not what it was designed for.If you are in the market for a TV, and your price point is in the \"just below $2000\" and you want a 50\" this is your TV.  Smaller size/price point?  Go with the 4254 or 4264 from Samsung.  You won't regret it.- Update (2/14/2008): with the price hovering just over the $1,000 mark, this thing is an even better buy.  8 months later and no complaints. -Josh- Update (2/8/2011): Power supply blew.  TV was still chugging along until that happened.  The good news is that I found the power supply from an online parts shop for $70 and instructions from a forum and downloaded the tv service manual in PDF form so plan to fix it myself.  Paying Samsung certified tech to do it would be about $400, not worth it for a 4 year old TV.", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "My Thoughts on the HPT-5064", "Author": "J. Carter", "ReviewID": "RH7E2R26VMAHU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HPT-5064 is one of CNET's top 5 rated plasma HDTVs as of this writing (9/13/07), and with good reason. This TV has all the major features at the right price point in today's market, making it a strong contender on your shopping list. I shopped every LCD, DLP and Plasma in this price range, and the HPT-5064 emerged time and time again as the #1 choice.Let's get something out of the way first - you're probably going back and forth between 1080p and 720p TVs, trying to figure out if 1080p is worth the premium. Quick calculation - at this size (50\"), you're supposed to be sitting at least 10 ft. back. At that distance, your eyes won't be able to tell the difference between 720p and 1080p. So, my advice - buy this TV. If you can't sit at least 8-10\" back, if you've got the patience of a monk and are willing to wait for 1080p prices to fall to 720p prices, or if you're one of those people who never buy anything for fear that there's something \"better\" out there, go for 1080p. Then again, you may get hit by a truck tomorrow, and 1080p isn't going to do you much good then, is it? Your headstone will say:While He Was Waiting For 1080pGot Hit By A Semi Going 73Like something out of Disney's Haunted Mansion. You know what I'm talking about. Also replace \"He\" with \"She\" if you are a girl. I would have put \"He/She\", but that's a strange construct with all kids of linguistic baggage that I avoided in the name of brevity...even wit, if you could call it that.The best advice for technology is, \"Don't buy the hottest thing - buy yesterday's hottest thing\". Why? Because technological upgrades aren't exponential, they're incremental. You're paying for a lot more than you're getting at the time. Meanwhile, prices on yesterday's hot thing are dropping faster than the housing market. Look at Apple. You buy something, and as the UPS guy is ringing your doorbell, they cut the price in half and release a new model. Apple's cool, though.Enough philosophy. Here's what I love about this HDTV:* Fantastic, natural-looking picture with no macroblocking, ghosting or blurring. Coming off a 32\" LCD that suffered from all those problems, I'm very happy. Colors are perfect. Blacks are black (not CRT black, but CRTs aren't 3\" deep either). Contrast is amazing. Feed this thing high-quality off-air HD channels, your Xbox 360 or PS3, HD-DVDs or Blu-Ray, or 480p DVDs, and you'll be impressed. Standard def, as expected, looks like standard def stretched out over a 50\" screen. If that's your thing, go for it, but I don't suggest it. This thing thrives on a diet of steady HD content. Go to your parent's house if you want to watch...I dunno. I was going to say Sesame Street or Antiques Roadshow, but even public television comes in HD now, and your parents probably have an HDTV, so my joke has no punchline. Go to your parent's house anyway, your mom misses you and will probably make you a sandwich.* 3 individual picture adjustments for each input with three modes - Dynamic, Standard and Movie. Dynamic (also known as \"torch\" mode or \"store\" mode) will make your eyes bleed, just don't do it. Standard is great for brightly lit daytime viewing (though tends toward the blue spectrum), while Movie features the greatest amount of adjustable values, and fits the bill as the default setting for discriminating viewers (see CNET's website for settings that are just about perfect). Any adjustments you make to the three modes are kept in memory for each input. It's a tweaker's dream. Just don't drive your significant other crazy trying to determine if \"48\" or \"49\" is the best color value. (P.S. - it's 48...or is it?)* Burn-in protection. Go ahead, admit it. You're worried about burn in. You've read the reviews that say that burn-in is overrated, but then, right there on the forum, man, is a dude who took a picture of his brand new plasma with the CNN logo permanently etched in. If you're worried, Samsung threw in a few modes that can help you prevent and erase burn-in. I take the whole burn-in issue with a grain of salt, from both sides. Just like with your old CRT, you shouldn't display any still images for an excessive amount of time (multiple hours), but watching a letter-boxed movie one night isn't going to ruin your television. Just use common sense and don't leave Bioshock or your TiVo on pause for 6 hours with the TV on. And run the modes every so often, it can't hurt.* Style - this TV looks better than its step-down model, the HPT-5054. The speakers are hidden beneath a thin bezel on the bottom of the set. It's also glossy. I'm not a glossy fan, but good luck trying to find a 50\" plasma that isn't glossy. It's like trying to find a bathroom when you really have to use the bathroom. In other words, it's hard to find. Maybe I didn't look that hard. I guess if you really have to go, it doesn't matter if you find one or not. A bathroom, that is. It's also got the anti-glare screen and the USB port for showing pictures and what not. The TV, that is. I don't know of any bathroom that has a USB port, but hey. They're putting USB ports in just about everything nowadays, so who knows. Maybe I just gave somebody an idea. Which I won't get credit for. Again.* Viewing angle - you can walk right to the edge of the bezel and this TV gives a perfect picture with no washout.Other random advice: If you've got the room, go for this or a bigger set. Never settle for smaller when it comes to HDTVs. If you've never had a big set before, you'll get this thing home and say, \"Dear God, what have I done?\" like a mad scientist who has just seen his monstrous creation come to life. However, after a few days, you will acclimate to the size, and may even say to yourself, \"I could have gone a little bigger.\" Then, one night, you will watch your old TV and say, \"You are puny, and insignificant.\" And maybe you will make-believe that you are crushing your old TV between your thumb and forefinger with one eye closed, because it is really that small that it can be crushed in such a manner. Don't worry, your old TV doesn't have feelings. But you do. And you are sad that you paid almost half of what you paid for the new TV for the old TV. So you stop crushing it. And maybe you pout your lip a little. Maybe not. I'm just saying get the bigger TV, that's all, try not to read too much into it.", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Highly recommended", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R2QDLNDL0ZMLHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shopped endlessly for an HDTV at all of the retail stores, and I was pretty much set on Samsung for quality and price.  I finally decided on the 50 inch 5064 and I am so glad I did.  It looks beautiful, just mesmerizing. My signal is from Verizon FIOS for the HD with an HD-DVR through HDMI connections.The order was filled within one week and the delivery company called me to arrange a time the next day.  They arrived on time, unboxed the unit, moved my old 36 inch CRT (240 pounds) and set up the new plasma TV, all in about 10 minutes.  The crew was very friendly and professional. All in all I saved money and had a very pleasant purchase experience.The only problem is that I can't stop watching it! It's great!", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier with my first HDTV - Samsung 5064", "Author": "havoc752", "ReviewID": "R3UJUYZIAT2PHB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been hunting for a HDTV for months. This would be my first HD set, so I tried to educate myself as much as possible before making a purchase. I read magazines, CNET, and customer reviews from CNET, Circuit City and Amazon and looked at hundreds of sets in stores.Initially LCD looked like the best choice for me between LCD, Plasma, and Rear projection TVs. I was looking to spend about $2000 with a size of 46-55\" but the biggest determining factor for me was picture quality. I wanted the best picture quality I could get for my money. I was leaning towards a 1080p LCD TV, and I was almost ready to pull the trigger on a Sony Bravia KDL-46v2500. However, I read a lot of negative press about backlight clouding / mura effect, which was a deal-breaker for me buying an LCD. Check out the AVS forums for more details about this...totally turned me off to buying an LCD.So, I decided against LCD because of backlight clouding, and also the motion blur clearly seen with fast action. Rear projection didn't make the cut either, as it appeared to have the worst image quality of the 3 HD formats. I finally settled on Plasma because I wanted a TV that would have minimal motion blur for sports, as well as having a nice contrast ratio so I could watch movies and play games on my Xbox 360.After looking at plasmas in person, the best two TVs at Best Buy looked to be the Pioneer PDP-5070HD and the Samsung HP-T5064. The Pioneer had a few more features including a CableCard, but a higher price tag. I personally thought the Samsung had a sharper picture than the Pioneer, and I think I made the right decision based on all my factors.The 5064 looked great in the store, and hooking it up at home did not disappoint. I currently do not have any digital or hi-def cable hooked up, I have the coaxial cable plugged directly into the TV. The built-in QAM tuner picked up a number of broadcast stations in HD, like CBS, NBC, ABC and others. I watched the Travelers Championship (Golf) in 1080i on CBS, and it totally blew me away. The picture is CRYSTAL CLEAR. The level of detail is incredible, and the colors really pop. The flesh tones of the golfers looked great. The fine details of the landscapes and greens of the golf course were extremely sharp. Even standard def cable is quite good for an HDTV, much more tolerable than most HD sets I've seen.I also watched a few DVDs through component on my Xbox 360. I was very impressed with watching Sin City and Goodfellas, even in standard 480i. The level of detail is great, and I expect even better results when I purchase an upscaling DVD player. Overall the picture quality is very, very good - everything I wanted in my first HD set. Colors are accurate, bright, and vibrant.Playing 360 on this TV with game mode was jaw-dropping. I played Burnout Revenge in 720p, and it looked great. Very clear, bright, and detailed. I recently loaded up Gears of War and played split-screen with a friend, and all I can say is wow.The menu-systems are intuitive and very user friendly. I was impressed with the amount of picture quality controls available. There are many options to customize the picture to your personal preferences. I suggest using movie mode, as it offers the most options for fine tuning.Samsung also included a number of screen burn protection modes, which will prevent or reduce the likelihood of burnt-in images on the TV. I have yet to see anything burnt in to my display, but I have been cautious to make sure that doesn't happen. As long as you don't leave a DVD menu on for 8 hours, you should be fine.One other pleasant surprise was the speakers on the TV. I was expecting low quality because the speakers are thin and hidden in the bezel. They are however much better than most tube and CRT TVs I've owned. The clarity is good, and the level of bass is decent. You'd be a fool not to hook up a home theater system to this TV, however. I just hooked up an Onkyo surround sound system, and in combination with this big screen TV, it really creates the home theater experience I'm sure most of you are looking for.Two final details worth mentioning, this TV has PIP and a swivel stand. Many HD sets do not include picture-in-picture, this TV does. I have not tested it a great deal, but I am certain I will be using it in the future. The 5064 also includes a swivel stand, allowing the TV to be turned about 20 degrees in either direction. This feature is usually only found in LCD displays, and I definitely did not expect it!So far I have been EXTREMELY satisfied with my purchase, I highly recommend the TV for anyone shopping for a plasma in the $2000 price range. Only negative thing I could say right now, is the anti-reflective coating on the screen could be much better. I suppose it does reduce some reflections, but I've still seen some glare. Otherwise a really fabulous set with great features and incredible picture quality.I got a great deal on this set also. I purchased my 5064 from Amazon for $1875 with no taxes and free shipping. Getting a 50-inch plasma at this price would be unheard of a few years ago! I was a bit apprehensive about buying a TV online, but Amazon made it an extremely smooth transaction. The TV arrived within a week. The delivery company was quick and courteous. Overall, I was satisified with the experience, buy with confidence from Amazon!Also, sorry for the long review, but after reading reviews for months I wanted to be as helpful as possible for other people shopping for an HDTV. If you're in the market for a new HDTV go with this Samsung - you won't be disappointed!!Two more things:To minimize the chance of screen burn in for plasma TVs, make sure you turn down the contrast and brightness for the first 100-200 hours. Also try to minimize the amount of content you watch with black bars (i.e. movies, 4:3 content) for the first 100-200 hours. Avoid any static or still images if you can. Set pixel shift to 4:4:1, you can find this option under the screen burn protection modes.Google or search the AVS forum for:Zippy's \"Officially\" Unofficial Samsung 54/64 PDP settings,tweaks and tips threadHere you will find some picture settings of how to calibrate your 5064I sincerely hope this review was helpful, and I wish you the best of luck in your search for the perfect TV, I found mine!", "Date": "July 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Judder audio drop issues fixed making this a steal of a deal!!!", "Author": "Art vandelay \"importer/exporter\"", "ReviewID": "RD47TG3T0JENP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Get firmware 1039 and that will fix the judder and audio drop issues making this a steal of a deal.

Braceros", "ReviewID": "R3UDO32PYDKU8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I'm back. Initially my review had been a disappointing 2 stars. I had ordered this product from amazon and had scheduled delivery of the tv on a saturday. Everything was ready, my wall mount, my hd cable box, etc. The eagle guys came and everything was going good. They unpacked it, and lo and behold, a massive crack right in the middle of the sexy screen. As well there seemed to be a dent in the back as well. So, with a heavy hand I signed a denied delivery statement on the shipping record and they took the tv back. This happened Saturday, Sept 15th, 2007. I had ordered this tv on Sept 6th. I thought to myself, great, another 9 slow days of waiting.After a few phone calls with Amazon, I was assured that I would be getting one soon, and not only that one of the customer service reps said he would do everything he could to make sure I could get the tv before the next NFL Sunday (I really didn't believe him, but it was nice of him to say). So, tracking my order, I saw that they had set up the order on Sept 17th. Looking at my previous experience, I expected to get my tv on the 26th (9 days). With the help of eagle's tracking system, I was able to track the set, and to my surprise, it shipped the next day, and by Friday, the 21st, the tv had already arrived in Chicago! Amazing!PRO TIP: In the 2 experiences I've had with Eagle, often times they scan an item when it arrives in their facility, but it may take them a day or 2 to give you a call to schedule an appointment for delivery. Using their tracking system found on this website: [...] you can track your package, and when it says arrived in whatever city you are in, be proactive and give them a call and they will set you up with a time to deliver. One of the things you might have to do is to navigate their website to find the phone number to their local office close to you. My tv showed a arrived status in Chicago on the 21st. I called and was able to schedule delivery that day, for the 22nd!So, the next day, Eagle arrived, and it was the same 2 guys from Eagle from the last week, and they remembered me, and were very nice. They commented that hopefully everything would be good when they unpacked it. They removed the tv and it was flawless. They took away the box and the packaging and said if I had any questions to contact amazon. Very nice guys. Overall, I would rate Eagle 4 out of 5. I understand that sometimes things happen and that's what happened to the first tv. Both times though, the delivery guys were courteous and professional.Now onto the tv. First of all on the outside, this thing is just sexy. Its very sleek and its clean lines really draws attention to it. When mounted on the wall, it looks amazing. As expected, SD channels look ok, they are kind of grainy and that is to be expected. The HD channels and upconverted DVD picture is brilliant. Very crisp and I couldn't stop watching it during football Sunday with everything on HD. The anti glare is great and it helps when you are watching in a bright well lit room. One of the things that I like is the three picture settings, Dynamic, Movie, and Standard. Dynamic is for sunlit rooms, standard for regular light, and movie settings are for rooms that are completely dark. Also, as someone else mentioned, one of the other features I like is that it makes a small beeping sound when you turn your tv off. This helps to know that you actually turned off your tv as opposed to turning off just the cable box.PRO TIP: While looking through CNET, I found some optimal settings that they used for the Movie settings:Below you'll find the settings we found best for viewing the Samsung HP-T5064 in a completely dark room via the HDMI input with a 1080i source.

I understand that this review is usually meant for just the TV, but I figured I post about my overall experience of buying this tv and owning it, from Amazon since that is what convinces someone to buy from here anyway, not just the rating of the TV. So, to sum up:Samsung HPT5064 - 5 stars out of 5. Incredible tv for its price. I love it. Sexy.Amazon Customer Service - 5 stars out of 5. Thanks for being patient while I yelled. You guys really came through in the end.Eagle - 4 stars out of 5. Even with the first debacle of the tv, your guys were polite, understanding and professional.

Before I talk about the TV, let me say that buying from Amazon was an excellent experience. The transaction was fast, and the trucking company that delivered it -- Eagle Freight -- delivered it way ahead of schedule, brought inside my house, unpacked it and made sure it arrived in good condition. All in all Amazon was great to deal with.I chose a 720p plasma for a couple of reasons. At first I was on the 1080p bandwagon but after more research found that since my sofa is 14 feet from the TV, my eyes would not be able see much difference between 720p and 1080p at that distance. So why pay more for 1080p?  Also, no broadcast service has any plans to broadcast in 1080p. None, nobody. It will be years, if ever, before 1080p gets broadcast. So why pay more for 1080p?I looked at a number of 50-inch plasmas including Panasonic, Pioneer, Toshiba, LG, Vizio and Samsung. To my eyes the best pictures were found on the Pioneer and Samsung. The Pioneer plasmas have wonderful color rendition but seem to be a little soft in the focus, not as sharp as the others. Panasonics seem to have a slightly reddish hue that I don't care for. I won't mention LG and Vizio. The new Samsung -- this model -- impressed me with a highly balanced image: it has bright but realistic colors (unlike LCDs, which are too bright and cartoonish) with a sharp, clear image.The HPT-5064 has a very good user menu. Each input can be customized -- in other words, you can set color and contrast for HDMI while having other picture settings for component, etc. There are so many settings that it is a little overwhelming at first. I like the \"Standard\" and \"Movie\" modes: you can set color, tint, brightness and contrast for regular viewing; for watching movies at night in a dim room, you can have custom picture settings that are less bright.Using a home theater computer and a good Nvidia graphics card, I found that even though the TV is 720p, it will accept a 1080p signal through HDMI and properly downconvert. 1080i and 720p through either over the air or DirecTV look stunning on this TV.There are a bunch of other features on this set that I won't go into because this review is too long as it is. The USB port is handy if you want to show some pictures from your digital camera (easiest way is to buy a little adapter with USB male on one end and accepts the camera's SD card on the other).Are there any negatives to this TV? A couple of minor issues. One is that switching inputs -- say from HDMI(1) to HDMI(2) -- takes several seconds with some awkward shapes on the screen. The other thing is that some ticker tapes (horizontal scrolling stock quotes or sports scores) can be jerky and not as smooth as I would expect. Other than these minor flaws the Samsung performs great. Watching movies and especially HDTV is an \"eye candy\" experience. With standard DVDs I get the feeling that the Samsung is showing all of the picture information that is available -- you get a real sense of the limitations of regular DVDs. The 5064's compatibility with 1080p makes me confident that once Blu-Ray DVDs become more commonplace and reasonably priced, the HPT-5064 will show an excellent image at 720p or 1080i downconverted from 1080p.All in all I think the HPT-5064 is an excellent value.", "Date": "July 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best value available right now", "Author": "D. Ferriola", "ReviewID": "R2OV8COJ5I8VQD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this tv last week.  Ordered it on Amazon and it came in five days, was perfect out of the box, EGL delivered it on time and set it up on my TV stand.  The TV is great!  Lots of great features and by far the best value for plasmas on the market today.  I did a lot of research on Phillips, LG, Vizio, Panasonic, Sharp and the Samsung 5064 picture blew them all away (the Pioneer 5070 is a slightly better picture but it's $600 more, and the quality improvement doesn't warrant such a higher price).  I'm running it on Direct TV HD, which looks great, and an OPPO Upconverting DVD player.  Here's some important things to know about this tv:  the picture settings need to be adjusted to get the best picture.  Samsung's DNIe feature in Dynamic Mode is way too saturated (which is the factory setting.)  The best picture setting is turning off DNIe and switching to Movie Mode.  Also, the SHARPNESS SETTING DOESN'T WORK ON ANY SAMSUNG PLASMAS!!!  That's right, the sharpness for some reason doesn't change when you move the sharpness cursor (as was confirmed by Samsung's Level 2 technical support)...it's not that big of a deal because the factory setting is pretty accurate, but if you like to play with your sharpness setting this TV isn't for you.The price has dropped twice since I bought the TV two weeks ago and Amazon has refunded accordingly.

Well, I don't know how the Vizio would have worked out.., but I can tell you I am TOTALLY satisfied with this Samsung Plasma.  I have had it for several week now, and have had no trouble whatsoever with it.  It worked right out of the box and has kepton chugging.  I got some suggested settings at an on-line web site for the TV for the first 100 hours of use, to protect from \"Burnin in\" on the screen.  The color, tone, brightness settings are a cinch to use once you are familiar with them.  Which doesn't take long.  The remote has proven to be very user friendly.  For a layman like me, with no degree in all this TV stuff, this is an outstanding TV for your everyday TV use.  The HD is breathtaking.  Even the standard cable broadcast looks great.  Count me as totally satisfied with this TV.NOTE:  ALWAYS BUY YOUR \"STUFF\" THROUGH AMAZON.  THEY ARE THE BEST!!!!!It may sound funny to buy a 50\" plasma on-line through Amazon.  But don't let that worry you at all.  These guys are pros.  They make all the arrangements for shipment with the best delivery company's.  A+ experience.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!3 MONTH UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11/25/2007Well I have had my Samsung now for over 3 months, my verdict.  I don't think I have ever enjoyed an NFL season as much as I have this year.  This Unit has provided nothing but pure enjoyment for me and my family.  I have read the other reviews and just have to be thankful that I am one of the lucky ones.  I have had NO, count them, NO problems with this TV. No sound issues, no picture issues, no pip issues..., no nothing issues, Folks no kidding if you want a supurb HD/Plasma TV  this is the one to get.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 YEAR 3 MONTH UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Mar 08, 2009OK Here's a one year 3 month review:Well, nothing to report yet...really.  Not one single service problem.  I have just gone through my second NFL season with my SAMSUNG, it was again flawless.  This TV has been absolutly reliable.  I have experienced no service problems, no performance problems, and no reception problems...NONE.  We have HD, a dvd/blueray, and a WII.  All feed in by either HDMI or av cables.  All perform as expected.Again, for those of you who are considering a plasma...., this is the one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!3 year and 3 Month update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This TV is still performing exactly as hoped for.  I have had absolutely NO problems.

In that time I have used it with a Samsung DVD 1080p7, Sony PS3 and Denon 987 AVR.The picture quality is fantastic. Read the CNet reviews on 720 vs 1080 and you'll see that at under 55 inches and over 8 feet away, there is no benefit to 1080. But it will definitely cost you more.With that in mind, I purchased this set to use for watching upconverted DVD's, Blu Ray, over the air HD football and some gaming.Fooball looks phenomenal. No pixelization when the players are running, the set grabs the HD signal with my amplified/powered antenna and translates it to Dolby Digital. Nice.Upconverted DVD's look marginally better than standard DVD. It more or less depends on the DVD more than the TV.Gaming is a lot of fun on a TV this big and this vivid. The color depth is great and it's a fun experience.Blu Ray is where this set really shines. The sharpness and clarity are unbelievable. Just breathtaking. The contrast is perfect, the color balance is perfect, it's something to behold. I've never seen anything look this good on screen. Maybe IMAX.....maybe.....This TV is loaded with burn in protection. Pixel shifting, different brightness settings, pure white screen to eliminate image retention, scrolling gray to white screen to wipe it clean. It's fantastic.I also like that Samsung is providing firmware updates that can be easily installed using the USB input on the side of the TV.The set is beautiful. This has definitely provided an air of class to my set up. I love it. I have no regrets on this purchase.If there is a downside, it's that it takes about 200 hours to properly break in the set. So at first, you have to tone down the contrast, brightness, sharpness and color levels. After break in, set it to your hearts desire and enjoy.This has really made my home theater come to life.", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice PIcture, But Issues with Sound", "Author": "tschup0", "ReviewID": "R2H65PVXP15WID", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture quality on this TV is excellent, but I would like to highlight two issues with the sound:1.

You can work around this with more complex cabling, but it would seem to be if you are going to put 3 HDMI inputs on the TV it should support the most common digital sound format.

Pioneer has 2 new models out in September 2007.  so, i'm waiting for that to make my move.  i owned a lot of Pioneer optical product.  love their quality but of course be ready for the price.  :-)i will also post this review and any updates/revisions on my own website, sokhaDotCom.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Samsung & Amazon: An awesome combination!", "Author": "Dr. D", "ReviewID": "R35W6SH4AHHQML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from Amazon about 3 months ago following about 2 years of research leading up to my purchase.

I was nervous about buying something this big and expensive over the internet, but Amazon had it on sale for $600 less than my local retailer and even included free shipping. So I took the plunge. The TV arrived within the week and the shipping company called me to set up delivery. The unit arrived in perfect condition (there wasn't a mark on the box) and was unpacked and the packaging removed by the delivery person. Now for the best part! A week later I checked on Amazon and noticed that they'd dropped the price of this TV by $75. I emailed them and promptly received a $75 credit to my card. About a week later, they dropped the price again, a further $125. Again, I emailed Amazon and, again, they promptly credited my card.

For those of you who are not, it's a good test. At the beginning of each episode the word \"LOST\" in white on a black background rotates and moves towards the viewer. After my break-in period, and watching the show, the \"LOST\" letters would leave a ghost image as they rotated across the screen. Sort of a spiral effect. It would be wiped out as soon as a new/different image came on to the set. Etch-a-Sketch sort of clearing. After a time, 6 weeks maybe, I can barely perceive this effect. The letters rotate leaving a clean black background. So...over time it seems to diminish almost beyond perception. At some point perhaps completely?Other observations (for lowly standard cable users like myself).  Some standard pictures look great. Some don't. History and Discovery look great. ESPN and FX are dark and grainy. Some adjustments do help. Standard pic vs Movie sometimes improves the picture. Movie is recommended most of the time.  Glare is noticeable. I have a dark room so not a problem for myself. If you have a bright room or windows behind your viewing area I'd probably consider a LCD.  My VCR pic is not too bad. Was a little worried but pleasantly surprised.  My up converting DVD pic can be greenish sometimes. Stilling experimenting for a fix. Anyone else have this issue?  Video games are awesome.  HD programming, as above, is awesome. I even watch golf now on occasion. NASCAR and NFL are killer. Green Bay in the snow game against Seattle was almost a religious experience. Can't wait for college football. Go Irish.  Tuner pulls in over the air great. Try your old antenna first. You may have no need to upgrade. You'll find you may even get some extra channels depending on your area. I even get scrambled cable channels on an occasion (over cable not OTA).  Sound is adequate for a sitcom or like.

The unit was ordered on Sunday July 1st and arrived Friday July 6th.  The unit arrived in great condition, was unboxed, and setup in a matter of minutes.Initial thoughts:What a beautiful television!  This unit has a stunning look with simple lines, a moderately thin bezel, an on/off button and the Samsung logo.  Just looking at this television without the power even turned on is a treat.  This is one of those products, (not unlike a IPOD or IPHONE) that when you see it you are overcome by that \"WOW\" factor.  Nice job by Samsung.Performance and Features:I did alot of comparison of this TV vs. other brands.  This plasma is rated high by many of the online reviewers, is loaded with some extra nice features (USB, PC Input, 3 HDMI inputs, PIP, anti-burn technologies, anti-glare screen, lots of color adjustments, etc...) and bottom line has incredible picture quality.My Experience:I've had this TV for only a couple days but I can tell you that when I watch HD programming, I'm just blown away but how clear the picture is and how vivid the colors are.  Normal satellite programing also looks very good.  I subscribe to Direct TV and I'm using their HD-DVR connected to the plasma via HDMI.Value:I compared the picture quality of 1080P sets vs. 720P sets.  My opinion is that when viewed over 10 ft. away it'll be very difficult to see the difference in resolution.  And, with very little programming available in 1080P, and with the much higher cost of 1080P (about $1K higher), it was easy for me to make this decision.  Pricing on this unit delivered was approximately $1800 as of 7/1/07.  For a 50 inch Plasma it's a bargain.Summary:A great 50\" plasma, loaded with performance, features, and stunning picture quality at a great price!  Doesn't get much better than that.----------------------------------------------------------------------Update 11/18/07I've owned this plasma for approximately 5 months now.  I have experienced only one problem.  Every now and then the audio drops out on the television.  At first I didn't know if it was my television, my DVR, or the HDMI connection between the two.  I did a little research on the WEB and found out that this problem was very common among other plasma TVs when using the HDMI connection and not specific to Samsung or this model.  Many other manufacturers also had this problem.  So, I contacted Samsung Customer service and highlighted the problem to them.  They informed me that this was a known problem and that there was a firmware upgrade for this.  I supplied them with my serial number information and they emailed my the firmware upgrade that same day.  Installation was a breeze and now everything is working great.  Couldn't have been more painless.Once again, couldn't be happier with this plasma.  And now with my first experience with Samsung customer service, I've got to say that I can reaffirm my original review.

Sure, the picture is generally great, but too many problems and too many service calls. I got sucked in based on the glowing reviews and paid dearly for my mistake. My HPT5064 is barely 14 months old and the power supply board needs replacement!!! Of course it went just after the warranty had expired. No surge, no brownout - just gone. I called Samsung when it went dark and they kindly advised their factory authorized company, which was to contact me to schedule the appointment. Well, 3 days later I get a call informing me that a technician will be there in 5 days. Count that: we're up to 8 days. The guy shows up, tests the unit and promptly informs me that I need a new power supply board. Total estimate: $360 plus tax.  So here I am, faced with the attractive option of investing almost $400 in a unit which has already given me multiple audio and picture ghosting problems and which has never worked with HDMI.

The final email, friendly but apologetic, stated that Amazon would no longer sell this particular model, and had no replacements available, and that our unopened unit would be picked up by UPS, and our money would be refunded.

(Why by an HDTV if youre not gonna watch mostly HD content - doesnt make much sense to me) Sound is so-so.  However, when one purchases a television like this, expecting great sound quality should never be one's top priority.  Most people hook up receivers and speakers for the sound.  If possible, that's the best option if your looking for better audio.  Also, get good cables.  Best site I have found for audio/video/speaker cable is Monoprice.com - great, quality cables for great prices.  You will never buy Monster again after you visit this site. Cables are something that I would generally buy online.  Seems to me all the big stores have a ridiculous mark-up on their cables.  Anyway, there IS image retention on this TV, I don't think it is burn-in, however, because it has always left after watching other content or programs, or running one (or both) of the screen burn protection modes (manual says one hour is good). It kinda bothers me, just because one has to take the time to be wary of that issue and be conscious of the viewing material and habits as related to the TV.  I didn't have that concern with CRT.  That being said, the good traits of the television FAR outweigh the few bad ones.  Glossy black cabinet, ambient blue light (which can be turned on/off) a good number and variety of inputs, swiveling base, anti-glare screen (which seems to work well for me) and most importantly, great picture quality.  1080p was a thought, (a fleeting one at that), but I couldn't justify the $400-500 price increase.  And at a proper viewing distance, I struggled to tell a difference between the 720p and 1080p picture.  (BTW - resolution is NOT the most important or sole factor in producing great picture quality.  Contrast, black levels, color saturation and other factors determine picture quality as well.  So don't get overhyped about 1080p)  Also, Amazon's price on this TV is about $100-$200 lighter than its lesser cousin, the HP-T5054, at the big box retailers.  The 5054 is also cosmetically one of the ugliest of Samsung's TV's (just my opinion).  I don't have it hung on a wall, so I can't say much about that. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.

Who needs suckers like BB and CC where you pay atleast 30%  more (than Amazon)+ tax + shipping + deal with strange salesmen who have no idea what they are talking about when you can go with Amazon. Anyways regarding the TV, I have to admit the picture quality on this TV was pretty impressive even on SD. My set however had some flickering issues (specially in non HD) which based on many owner's opinion was fixed by replacing the logic board with the latest model ( 07115 ). The TV worked great that day .Unfortunatly that was the last day my TV worked, next morning I decided to catch some news before going to work and boom no picture just sound. Needless to say i called the 'crappy' Samsung so called customer service and they sent the same company who had changed my logic board to fix it. The TV is at the shop now for God knows how long. Based on my personal experiences with Samsung products, its a gamble with the quality but not with the customer service ; which is always pathetic .They make sure you realize that you have made a mistake by purchasing a Samsung product. I can safely vouch for samsung's bad service and i know a lot of people who feel the same way.I would not bash this TV , I think if you don't have a bad luck with the set it works fine , its a good product. But for now I am going with Panny 77U which as far as I can tell from the picture is pretty comparable to Sammy 5064 & I am getting it for under $1300 (including shipping etc).

Anyway, I have to say that overall I am impressed with the HPT5064 running HD channels on DirecTV. I want to touch on something that I NEVER see mentioned in any reviews that is quite important. The HPT5064 offers very vivid and sharp pictures in HD like what I expected but, like with most HD screens I've seen, the picture is only as good as the signal its receiving. If your moving to HD then- based on cost and other comparison, the HPT5064 is super choice but, if your staying with traditional standard satellite or cable TV I would not recommend this set or any other HD screen. The screens are way ahead of these standard digital signals and it actually makes the pictures look a little worst that a non-HD set. Trust me...I manage over 200 HD screens of all makes and models and they all do this with standard definition DirecTV/ Dish signals.  Its embarrassing to see a $300 standard definition set display a clearer standard definition picture than a $3000 LCD. Keep this in mind my friends otherwise you will be disappointed with your new HD screens. CNN on DirecTV/ Dish is the best example where you can usually see the flaws im talking about. Also, don't expect great sound out of this set. Expect to run it through a amp with speakers for good sound.

Definitely at 1080i, this plasma's picture is better than most, if not all LCDs and almost all other plasmas in the same range.  As for overall external looks, its the most elegant and clean design of all, except maybe the Bang and Olufsen line, but hey, thats like comparing a BMW to a Ferrari.Hell, I did enough looking and shopping and reading.  I spend less time shopping for cars than I did for this TV.  Its even gone up in price by $200.00 since I bought it...So I feel real good there.Menus are easy enough to weed through.  THE ONE ISSUE I have so far, and I've only had it for two weeks, is that there is slight screen burn(yeah, I know, I know, and I've adjusted it for maximum burn in protection ALREADY!)from the edges of the standard view - only noticeable when picture switches to HD and displays light to white backgrounds - but at times, is clearly noticeable - a distinct line forms in the area where the standard picture normally displays on each side of the screen.  It is reduced after watching HD signal for an hour or two, but I've done everything to reduce screen burn - and this just seems like its there to spite me!  Anybody else have the same issue???I'm hoping that after the burn in period it will just go away - but probably not.

My wife and I were in the market for a new tv after we purchased our first home about a year ago. After extensive research and a few trips to the local Best Buy to get a look at this set in person, we decided it was the way to go. The picture in the store when compared to any of the other tv's was just a bit crisper than the other plasma's and LCD's, even in 720. Even the sales people said that for the money, this is the best tv out there right now. They all agreed that Samsung's new line of tv's is their best yet.Only issues to look out for are random sound loss while watching. I experienced this only when we got our new HD DVR box from Time Warner and connected the HDMI cable to the box. Apparently, there is a sound setting within the settings on the cable box that must be set to HDMI to get the sound to transfer. The random sound loss continues to happen every few days or so, but all I have to do is go back into the cable box settings and reset the HDMI sound setting and it comes right back. I am thinking about reporting this to Time Warner and replacing the box as soon as it get's annoying enough. Right now, I don't even want to sleep, go to work, mow the lawn, or go to the bar. I even miss it during the necessary trips to the bathroom.

I am receiving over the air digital signals from local towers, and the High Def'n pictures are really amazing. When you input a channel number, for example 3, the TV automatically checks for the digital HD signal and locks into 3.1 so you don't have to needlessly enter excess buttons all the time. The manufacturer should mention this in their description--I believe this to be a valuable design. Samsung says that the TV has guarded features that reduce the chance for screen burn-in of non-changing scenes; but then they go on to say that screen burn-in is not covered by the warranty. Fortunately Samsung makes it easy to adjust screen size so that any horizontal or vertical bars can be eliminated if the source of the picture size disagrees with the 16:9 widescreen. Sometimes the image is slightly distorted, however. The TV that I bought from Amazon was promptly delivered, unpackaged, and moved into my TV room. I set-up the TV to my existing Home Theater system without any problem (experience helps).  The definition and Trueness of the brilliant colors are quite a sight. I really love it. The glossy piano black finish of the cabinet is a delight in my TV room. The remote is very usefull, and has color coded buttons which are very convenient to quickly locate. Amazon has a 30 day return period which I am glad to say, I didn't need to use. Every aspect of the transaction was perfect. I don't know how I would send such a large item back if I needed to do so. Enough already....I'm going to go watch the NBA finals in HIGH DEFINITION.Update 4/7/2008:Nothing has changed. The Samsung is still wonderful. It's picture from over the air broadcast is better than any friend's High Def units to which it is compared. Even though we have watched many, many Netflix movies which frequently leave \"bars\" at the top and bottom (since they are not true 16X9 format) there is no burn-in.

I have owned this set for about 10 months and at the time the same size LCD was $500 more and the screens on the LCD's of the day just were not as bright as plasma IMO.Best thing to do, go to your local electronic store, compare TV's side by side and then buy it on Amazon.

Yes it is a plasma TV and YES there will be burn in at some point. After playing Guitar Hero III for hours with friends yes there is a ghost of the game burned into the screen.

In these two areas, the TV does not disappoint. It is certainly a very sharp TV and has an excellent picture while in HD and SD. Sadly, the TV also seems to suffer from some emerging technical issues that you may want to think twice about before purchasing.My first TV for lack of a better word was a lemon. It started to make a high pitched electrical chirping sound after a week of operation and went through extended periods where the sound would cut in and out. After examination by a service tech, he concluded that several boards needed to be replaced to remedy the issue. Disappointed, I sent the TV back for an exchange.The next TV did not exhibit any of these same issues and, as stated earlier, I believe it was an isolated problem with that particular TV I received. The new TV worked fine, but after a few weeks of viewing I noticed a very subtle flickering of the image while watching. Friends invited over did not seem to notice this, but after pointing it out to them, they saw it and were annoyed by it as well. It is only a matter of time before you see it, and then it becomes very distracting.After some research, it appears that this is a very recent logic board issue that exists not only on the 5054 model, but on the 44 and 64 models as well. Some have claimed that replacing the logic board will fix the issue, but I have been unable to verify the veracity of this. In short, if you buy this TV you are gambling that the flicker issue will either not exist, or not be noticeable to you. If you are unlucky, it may be fixed by replacing the logic board.Overall, I love the TV but I wished it actually worked without the annoyances. The flickering harms the viewing experience for me to such an extent that I will probably try a different manufacturer and set.", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV Purchase", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R2RJPP23R44QY9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Saved several hundred dollars on this beautiful plasma!There was mild burn in on this plasma, but was gone after a few hours of watching the TV.

I really enjoy the 3 HDMI ports. The simplicity of One Cord Hook-Ups is a No Brainer. My Onkyo THX Receiver handles the 1.3 HDMI connection from the DV-980H Oppo up-scaling DVD Player then out to the Mighty Samsung on the wall. Of course the Onkyo Handles the Front Bose 501's and the Infinity center channel, 2 Infinity 25es Rear Channel, with a pair of Alpha 50's for the rear surround pair, and you can't forget the Yamaha subwoofer. All for the Theater experience. But I really want an Infinity subwoofer the Cascade model I think. Anyone have any suggestions as to which subwoofer I should think about purchasing, or better yet Giving Me One for Christmas:) One could only dream. Because after all I have spent 98% of my allocated gift money already and I am told it will take me awhile before we can recover from my spending.Thanks ahead of time for your comments, and Happy Holidays to all.", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "tv lasted 1 week then quit", "Author": "jeff", "ReviewID": "R2B131QIDRC3GU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the samsung from amazon on january 2 and got it turned on and delivered to my house on the 10.  the tv worked great for the first 7 days then 1 night i go and try to turn it on and poof it makes loud noise then nothing dead. im very disapointed with this samsung im just glad i bought it from amazon they have allready shipped me out new 1.  i just hope this 1 last a bit longer.", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "love the tv>>>>> hate the BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ", "Author": "R.

I AM TOLD THAT POWER STABLIZER/CONDITIONER WILL FIX IT.  eAITHER WAY IT'S SOMETHING WITH THE CURRENT THAT IS GOING TO THE TV. THE NOISE IS NOT COMMING FROM THE SPEAKERS, IT'S COMMING FROM BACK OF THE TV.ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT SAMSUNG MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THEY NEVER HEARD OF THIS ISSUE, OR IF IT'S NORMAL FOR A 2K TV TO MAKE THIS ANNOYING NOISE.>>>>>>>> ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THAT IS.. SOMETIMES IF YOU PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION, YOU SEE DOUBLE PICTURE. eXAMPLE: IF I AM PLAYING BASKETBALL (PS3) AFTER 2 HOUR, I START WATCHING TV, AND AFTER 5 HOUR, I STILL SEE MY BASKETBALL MENUE AS A PICTURE WHICH IT ALMOST FROZE IN THERE.

HP replaced the TV as they could not fix the problem. The technician, (whom was wearing an HP shirt and name badge), that installed the new TV said that with the new TV my warranty resets. He told me this because I expressly asked \"what happens if the new TV ends up having the same problem?\" Less than 9 months later the new TV also broke with the same computer problem. I contacted HP technical department and I was told that the warranty explained to me by the HP technician was incorrect. They went as far as to try and say that the technician was from a 3rd party and didn't work for HP. I asked for the 3rd parties name and was told that HP wasn't required to give me that information.

I was told \"no I am so sorry but that was a promotion that we were running\"  I understand that this is a \"big business company\" but I would think they could make an exception when I offerd to email or fax a police report.  It's bad enough that I was ripped off once but twice?  So now to get the same tv that I bought 20 days ago I have to pay $150 more for shipping.
