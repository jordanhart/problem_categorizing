Due to problems with our satellite dish company, it took us that long to finally get everything hooked up.  As soon as we did, we discovered 1) the remote control did not work and 2) there were horizontal black lines across the screen.  I called technical support 4 times and heard nothing back.  I then emailed them and still heard nothing back.  I finally called their customer support line and surprise of all surprises, I actually got to talk to a person!  I explained what was going on so she put me on hold to go talk to technical support.  20 minutes later she came back on the line and said that no one was available in technical support but that it sounded like TV was defective (really?!).  She said that since I was out of the Amazon warranty period, my only option was to go online and complete some online forms then ship the TV back to California (I live in Ohio).  If they were able to fix the problem, I would get the TV back in approximately 3 weeks, if not, they would replace the TV.  What a nightmare!  Fortunately Amazon was willing to take all this into consideration and let me return the TV to them even though I was outside the 30 day warranty (barely).  Shame on Sceptre 1) for selling inferior products and 2) for having such incredibly poor customer/technical support.

Usually at this price point u have to buy this kind of stand separately.- good tv for a good price!.Cons:---------- remote control: the buttons are very close together & seem very awkwardly laid out. It feels very cheap- the cable inputs on the back of the TV are well labeled but very hard to use as they run vertically & u have to insert them blind basically.

Its annoying. Picture is fine. Connections in the back are pretty flimsy. When connecting the component video and audio cables the jacks are flimsy and move quite a bit. The remote control has a very flimsy feel. Will check tech support and return if it doesn't get resolved.Update- I called tech support at Sceptre and they suggested I try different cables from the AT&T; U-verse receiver . I originally had component video and audio wires. I switched to an HDMI  cable and the noise went away.  Whatever the root cause was its resolved now. So overall  the TV is doing fine now that i changed the connection to the U-verse receiverUpdate- About 8 months old and still working fine. I only upped my star rating one star because even though the sound is background noise is resolved its becuase of a workaround and not a solution to the problem. Using the HDMI ports instead of the Component jacks isn't a fix. If a TV is going to have Component inputs they should work. These doen't without noise. The fact that the HDMI inputs worked is not a plus, its table stakes. They are supposed to work. So I upped my rating to 3 stars becuase of the valid comments I saw to my post. But the TV remains only OK. Picture is OK, pixilates a lot on sports or concert type images. It was challenging to find a code that worked using AT&Ts; uverse remote to control the TV.

This is apparently a common problem with these TV's. I tried to contact customer service several times to no avail. I then filed a BBB complaint and immediately a Sceptre customer service representative contacted me and was very helpful. They sent me a shipping box and a prepaid shipping level to return the TV to them (all at no cost to me). Surprisingly, they sent me a brand new replacement TV instead of repairing the one they sent me. In the end, I was pleased with the outcome, but you may have to resort to the BBB to get good service like I did. I've had the replacement TV for 4 months now with no problems.The complaints about the tinny speakers on this TV are exactly right. They're terrible. However, I was able to connect a pair of spare USB-powered speakers using the tv's usb port and headphone port and am VERY happy with this setup. The speakers come on automatically when the TV is turned on and go off when the tv is turned off, and the volume control on the remote DOES control the volume of the speakers. The TV actually comes with a 7-band EQ (an unexpected feature on a cheap tv) that allows me to get those speakers sounding just the way I want them.All in all, if you can get this TV bundled with an extended replacement plan for cheap, I say go ahead and buy it. It has a great picture, all necessary inputs, and can have excellent sound with convenient USB-powered speakers.

Don't expect it.  I have a home audio system that I use when I want good sound.  If you put this TV in a large room - you're going to need  supplemental sound.

Lower Quality.", "Author": "J. Cristobal", "ReviewID": "R22ZL7FP5DQDDP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "PROS:-It's super cheap for a 32-inch-It works (at least mine does)-HDMI! (just like every other flat screen...)-USB! (at least as many ports as every other flat screen)CONS:-Terrible, TERRIBLE audio. If this is the only 'con' that makes you skeptical, then just invest in a sound system (even a cheap crappy set of speakers should be an improvement). What I found is that the volume control only seems to work at super low volumes. I think its on a scale of 1-100 and basically, once you hit 35 or 40, the sound of the speakers crapping all over themselves makes it impossible to hear any of the highs or lows that it's trying to put out. So basically any (actor's) voice that varies in either direction (up or down) from absolutely calm and practically monotone will cause the TV to start crapping so loudly all over itself that you can't stand to watch.-Screen Resolution. Ok I've tried and tried to find some sort of setting to fix this, and I'll admit I'm no expert on the difference between digital and analog TV channels, but for me, the only channels displayed in full resolution are ones that I happen to get the \"digital\" version of. To watch any \"analog\" channel in \"standard\" resolution leaves 2-3 inches of black, unused space on all four sides of the screen. The picture isn't a square (like I'd of thought analog would make it), its just like resizing your browser window to exactly 3/4 of its size (when maximized), and then carefully centering it on your screen. Annoying as s***, right? The only way to get a full screen of picture is by selecting either the \"zoom\" or stretch settings, which will either result in cutting off a few inches from every side or making all of your favorite celebrities super short and fat. Perhaps I am just way behind the times with my cable service and need to upgrade or something. I dunno. But it's really annoying because apparently every channel I ever watch is like this.-Color. This isn't as unbearable as the last two complaints, but I cannot freaking find some decent color options that work for everything. Like, I finally adjust every setting for contrast, tint, brightness and everything so that it looks acceptable for an Xbox game, but then put in a movie and you can't see a thing. And while I'm here, don't even think about buying this if Xbox (or probably any game console) is going to be a primary use for it. I've tried every combination of picture settings but this TV doesn't even try to do justice to their graphics. I bought Borderlands 2 as soon as it came out and played it for weeks on a similar LCD, and the picture quality was mind blowing!! Then I brought it home and the game looked like it was made 10 years ago. But hey, at least I get a full resolution picture when I'm gaming, right?-I guess those are my only complaints really.

My attitude was that for the price if it only lasted two years I would be ok with that. I absolutely loved it until 4 months later, in Nov. 2012, when the picture went out. Dealing with customer service was difficult. It took all day to get a hold of someone. I suspect they have one person answering the phones. They mailed me a box to send the TV back for repairs that took over a week. I Mailed it back...4 more days.From the time I contacted customer service from the time I got my TV back was just short of a month by two days. I wasn't upset at all because I thought I would be getting a TV that would now not have any problems. I was wrong. As soon as I hooked up the TV there was a NEW PROBLEM...6 yellow dots on the screen. It is extremely noticeable especially on a black screen when the TV is just turning on and you see the Sceptre logo. They obviously didn't not test the TV before sending it back! Now I am trying to contact customer service again!I would love to support an American made product and American employees. I knew for the price I was taking a chance, but this is RIDICULOUS! Why can't they deliver a quality product with quality customer service??? I would be happy with semi-quality for the price but HOW CAN I SUPPORT THIS COMPANY WHEN I SEND THE PRODUCT BACK TO BE REPAIRED AND IT COMES BACK WITH ANOTHER PROBLEM AND IS STILL UNWATCHABLE? That is not quality not even poor quality it is JUNK! SHAME ON YOU SCEPTRE. HAVE SOME STANDARDS!Still trying to get a hold of Sceptre Customer service or live chat online. According to their hours on their voice mail and on their website, they have been \"open\" for 50 minutes. Live chat says offline. When I phone customer service I just get voice mail.I got through! The rep was very helpful...exceeded my expectations. They are emailing me a mailing label and I will send it back for service today.I finally have my tv back and it's workign the way it should! I have owned it for 6 months it died at 4 and it took nearly 2 months to be repaired, since they sent it back with a problem.
