So far, i'm in love. Watching blu rays on my ps3 is a new experience. I want to go through all my movies and watch them again. The panel is just sexy. For my ps3 for blu rays, I use cinema mode (obviously recalibrated) and the picture is so smooth and crisp. My brother noticed right away how smooth and real the movement was. For my xbox 360, im using Game Mode (recalibrated as well). I've been playing mass effect 2 and it's way more vibrant and rich. I have no issue with IR or burn in. As long as you set your tv to Orbiter and do a \"color wash\" every so often it cleans away any IR in a matter of seconds.I was very nervous as this was my first plasma and i read about burn ins and IR. But after only 3 days and doing research I feel more confident in the tv and plasmas in general. I just do the \"color wash\" mode sometimes when im gone to break in it/speed the break in process up.  If im playing a game that has a HUD on for a while, ill pause the game, and do a quick \"color wash\" for about 10 seconds and set it back to orbiter and keep playing. Now, this may sound annoying, but honestly, it's not. You get used to it and get real quick at using the tv.Also the pk550 has a load of calibration options. I love that. Anyway, it's a great tv, def best bang for you buck for a 50\" 1080p plasma. This is my first plasma and it's an LG. I have much more faith in plasmas now. Especially lg.

I'm doing a break-in period for the set (not really necessary, but helps age the phosphor evenly) so the settings are a little low right now, but still fantastic.  I watched two BD movies so far(The Hurt Locker & StarTrek) and they were awesome to watch.  Colors were vivid and the detail kept my eyes popping out. lol  I don't know if I ever could be happy going back to DVDs again. lol**Note on plasma Tvs: Burn-In has not been an issue with plasma TVs for quite a few years, but you may still get some Image Retention.  I have seen very little IR on this set, and what did show up quickly went away.  I wouldn't even consider it an issue.I know Samsung has been having problems with loud buzzing sound coming from their plasma TVs, and a few heard it from other manufacturers as well(including LG), but I cannot hear any buzz coming from mine. I even held my head up to the TV and the only hum I heard was the mini-frig in the room. :)The screen is very uniform in lighting.  Probably my only wish would be for darker blacks.  My set is not calibrated yet, so I know it will go darker than it is now.  It's not bad mind you, but you can tell where the black bars end from a movie and the black bezel begins, which would disappear with the darkness of the room.**For the Gamers:  As far as I can tell, there is very little lag or none at all.  I tried a couple games (ie GTAIV & Crackdown) and got into a Semi-truck.  What I would do was pull the right trigger as fast as I could to go into reverse which causes the back-ups lights to come on with the beeping sound.  Even closing my eyes I would hear the click from the trigger at the same time as the reverse beep. The controls even felt the same coming from a computer (TN Panel) monitor.Just to point out, this TV does have a glossy screen.  My complaint with the Sammy was they stated it eliminated reflections, but it was mirror like.  The reflections are not as bad on this set and at least I knew about it ahead of time.So overall I am real happy right now with this set.Join us on AVSForum for more info.Encrypted Neuron", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just Plain Great", "Author": "Aurelio E.

I really wanted a Panasonic plasma since I love the 65\" Panasonic that we have in our theater room. But this LG was the only 50\" that fits in our ent center. I could not be happier with the LG. The picture is stunning in all AV modes. We bought it at Sears and they threw in the LG BD550 which is also excellent. I have to say the PK550 picture is on a par with the Panasonic plasmas. Blacks are excellent and colors are beautiful.  I tried the Picture Wizard for calibration and found the pre sets to be dead on.  We have had the TV for about a month and have used all the AV modes for general viewing, sports, and movies. Everything looks great. My only minor complaint is that the TV's virtual surround sound is not as good as I expected. But I have the TV connected to a Pioneer Amp and it sounds great.

Image retention issues even after break-in period.", "Author": "Alex Green \"alx779\"", "ReviewID": "R7V2HMTNTNO96", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "***Update March 1, 2011***The TV is now well past its break-in period (500+ hours) and it exhibits image retention issues. This is not a deal breaker since its only visible for a brief amount of time as the screen powers on/off, but still an annoyance and I am worried about long-term effects. As a result, I took off 1 star from my original review and adjusted the review title.***Original Review***I purchased this TV 2 months ago and I think it's a good time to share my thoughts about it...Overall, I am happy with my purchase. TV produces great picture and handles fast motion well, unlike most LCDs. Plenty of inputs/outputs on the back. There's a USB port, but it is somewhat gimmicky as it can only display the pictures off the USB device. Higher-end LG plasmas include the ability to play video files, but of course, you pay more for that privilege.The internal speakers actually manage to produce tolerable sound which some may even find sufficient. It was a pleasant surprise, but I still went for a 5.1 surround sound setup.I have not calibrated it yet, but people at AV Forums say that this TV actually outperforms some of the higher-end LG plasmas when properly calibrated.Many recommend \"breaking in\" the plasma by running the special slides which is supposed to minimize any image retention issues. I did not run the slides, but did make sure to run all video in full-screen mode for the first 100-120 hrs. The image retention showed its ugly head once -- after watching a letter-boxed Norwegian movie (shaking fist at Norway :) ), but it did disappear very quickly. Generally, it's best to stick with wide-screen picture to avoid this issue.Aesthetically, the TV is a beauty. Very thin profile for a plasma, a very slick look. The base that attaches to the stand, however, is quite wobbly and makes me a little nervous when I have to move the TV. Also, as others mentioned, screen glare can be an issue in bright lit rooms or if there's a light source facing it.All things considered, it's a solid 4 stars. A great purchase with only minor reservations. Definitely one of the best televisions in this price range.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture and Sound", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Grauer Kater\"", "ReviewID": "RUFDQIM0H62EJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this set for two months and it still has considerable \"wow!\" factor.  First, it was a steal.  (A few years ago a set approaching this quality could been priced at 2500 bucks.)  This TV has an excellent image, especially for movies and sports.  High resolution black and white movies look especially sharp, \"resonant\" and film-like.  The 550 affords lots of fine tuning depending on the program one has.  An unusual degree of sharpness may be dialed in if one wants it.  I'm not sure this is a criticism, but with certain settings, the facial make-up of performers in news casts and made-for-TV dramas (like \"Dexter\") is obvious, but the image may be adjusted to soften the \"hey, I see their make up\" factor.  I know many viewers may not use the on-board speakers of big TVs, but the 550's on-board speakers  are quite good.  These speakers are NOT thin or boxy sounding--even rock music sounds  nice, but they are great for dialogue.  Read reviews of other TVs--speaker quality is often neglected in contemporary TVs (and I have beheld many junk speakers--I think Samsung sets' speakers are often weak).  Also, this TV affords a visual difference between 720 and 1080 broadcasts--1080 is a visible, not a hypothetical, benefit. I watch a lot of up-converted-to-1080 DVDs (the DVD players do the up-convert) on this set, and they look great, so one doesn't have to have a new library of Blu Ray to get real benefits from the 550, if like me, one has scads of old movies on conventional DVDs.  The 550 also has lots of inputs, and a useful and intuitive remote, and, as I say,  lots of available color adjustments.  I am a nut for color adjustments, and I'll note that this machine has layers of fine-tuning for tint adjustments that I haven't ventured into yet.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great value, great quality, but glare is a factor", "Author": "Michael Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R2UA1C81TSFUWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV as a replacement for a 32\" Olevia that had issues with the remote and we were ready to upsize. I made the decision on plasma after visiting a local store and comparing the quality and price of several similar models in the same size. Plasma definitely has great color, and this is a very big difference from the old LCD. I am surprised at how thin this TV is, considering it is a plasma. I ran through the picture wizard, but I find that the Vivid color scheme is sufficient for our viewing most of the time. The USB viewer is a great feature and very easy to use, although it does not have the ability to sort pictures by name or date, so you can only view them in the order they are on the disk. The ability to play background music during the picture viewing is very convenient. The number and type of inputs on this TV are more than sufficient for our needs as we use a receiver for most of the video switching. The biggest problem we have with the TV is the glare, but I was aware of this before my purchase, and it is something that can be controlled with curtains and a few small tweaks to our room lighting. The picture quality is worth it!The biggest problem I had with this TV was the delivery. I ordered it a week before Black Friday and scheduled the delivery for the day before Thanksgiving so we could enjoy it over the holiday. Unfortunately, the first one arrived with cracks all over the screen. The delivery people inspected the unit but suggested the cracks were just the protective screen covering. Since the temperature was below 50 degrees F, they would not unpack it any further and would not power it up. I only discovered the cracks shortly after they left as I began to unpack it so I could install the mounting hardware. I called and was immediately given a new order for a replacement unit, however they would not reschedule the delivery immediately. I figured it would come quick since the first unit came with Amazon Prime 2-day delivery, but I was wrong. I was given a link to a web site to schedule my delivery, and the earliest date was 8 days away! I had to wait until Black Friday to call the shipper, who agreed to deliver the unit on Saturday, the next day. The new unit arrived on schedule, and the shippers did a more careful inspection, including  completely removing all packing and protective materials, and they took the old unit away at the same time.

It looked so much bigger than the 46\" we had in the living room.  I put this one in my room, and hooked it up to my DVR and blu ray player.  Right away, I noticed a small buzzing noise coming from the back of the TV; I then called LG and they sent a repair man from my city to come look at the tv.  The TV repair man did not think it was a problem because after turning up the volume, the buzzing noise couldn't be heard.  The buzzing noise was very small, I just wanted to make sure that it was not a problem.  When all the HD channels were registered on my DVR, the picture quality was and is just complelely amazing.  I watched Apollo 13 on Blu Ray and it was great.  I have noticed some image retention though.  This happends mostly on channels where there is a logo in the bottom of the screen.  For example, when I watch the history channel, there is a dark yellow H(standing for History) and a dark red HD symbol.  If that image stays on the tv for over 10 minutes or so, after changing the channel the image stays burnt in for a few minutes (but it never stays permanently burnt in, it always go's away after a couple minutes, so it isn't much of a problem)  Overall, I am very satisfied with the picture quality, the sound quality, the classy look of the tv, the great customer service from LG and Amazon, and the whole Plasma/HD expierence.  I would recommend this TV to anyone.  My advice is just right away be careful of the image retention and just make sure that you don't leave any image on the screen for over 20 minutes when the TV is brand new. I'm not sure how long it takes for an image to be completely burnt in, but I wouldn't mess with it at all due to the ghosting I have expierenced from mine (which I said goes away in a couple minutes and is not a problem).", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "great tv but..........", "Author": "writer chick", "ReviewID": "R3WKPISRSE7VX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i've had this tv all of 5 days and i'm already calling lg for service.it was wonderfull out of the box, i could'nt ahve asked for better-directv was awesome,blu ray drop dead gorgeous...then strange things started to happen. shutting itself off, turning itself on,volume issues,menus popping up without prompting.anyone else have this problem or anything similar?i'd hate to give this tv back, i love it already but i want my money's worth.UPDATE:lg worked on the tv fro me,replacing the front panel where-alledgedly- the source of the problem was.got the tv back on friday, come sunday night the menu problem returned.now lg says the problem is in the main board-whatever that is.once again they will \"fix\" the problem.stay tuned..........UPDATE#2: tv worked fine for 2 days then ANOTHER error message popped up.ENOUGH!lg will be giving me a new tv.i'll keep you posted........", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "One of the best plasma TVs at a great price", "Author": "S.

The picture quality is amazing when it is set up properly, which can be a little difficult due to the number of options. This plasma has many more options than most TVs for changing color levels, which allows you to get that perfect picture, but it is difficult to manage all of them. Truly, I would like to give this tv 4.5 stars because it does suffer from image retention problems. If you leave any static image on the screen for more than 3 seconds at a time, it will remain there for a few seconds when you change the channel. This isn't really a problem because as long as there is something on top of it, you won't even notice, but still an issue.I would highly recommend this tv at the price (I got mine for about $850 after shipping/taxes, not from Amazon).

You have 10w x2, which is not alot of power, as the investers believe that if you purchase a high end television, you will also purchase a sound system to go with it.

Reviewers at cnet and plasma tv buying guide love to split hairs over color shift and black levels and motion lag and \"dancing blue pixels.\"  They nit pick every tv to death and leave you scratching your head.  They have to say something, right?  I'm no expert, but I've never seen a television that more closely reproduced the image from a movie theater screen than this one.  The reason I was attracted to the pk line is because they display 24 frames per second from a blu-ray disc, which means your television is not trying to translate a movie's number of frames per second into video format.  It shows each frame of the movie 3 times in a row 24 times in a second (72hz).  I think it makes a difference.  I can imagine myself in a movie theater as I'm watching the screen.  Make sure the blu-ray player you buy also puts out 24 frames per second.  Maybe they all do, I don't know.  My dad bought me an lg bd530, which doesn't have netflix but I have a Roku so it doesn't matter.  You might want the bd 550 if you want netflix, or the bd 570 if you have to have a wireless one, i.e. no ethernet cable close to your theater set up.I do not recommend this set to anyone who has light emitting from a source directly in front of the screen.  It should be watched either at night or in a room with blackout shades.  A little ambient light from the ceiling is okay.  If you can find one, you might do just as well to purchase the pk250, which is the exact same screen but without a usb input and there maybe a few picture tweaks that are not available.  I bought mine at Sears for $699.00.  I'm amazed that there is a tv this good at this price.  I felt a little guilty for a few days because I don't feel like we're the kind of people who can afford a tv like this, but I guess we can because there it is in my den.I've tried some of the calibration settings online and I hate them.  Maybe I haven't found the right one.  Right now I'm using the cinema setting, with sharpness turned to 0 and the color temperature to w2.  That's right, I said the sharpness is set to 0.  I want my plasma to look like a movie screen, not a pc monitor.  I watched Christmas Story in blu-ray yesterday and it was the first time I've ever seen an image on a television that truly looked like a cinema screen.  Next time you watch a movie in a theater notice how the images are much softer than on a television.  If you doubt me, try my settings yourself.  Even Pixar looks crisp and vibrant with sharpness at 0.Also, though I try to be environmentally conscious in general you have to turn off the energy saving features on this tv.  There is no point to buying a set of this quality and then having the set constantly turning the brightness up and down.  I believe the tv companies were pressured to include these features but if you want to save electricity you're better off watching less television.Oh, and one final thing.  I picked up a pair of rabbit ears at Ace Hardware for $7.50 and we now have ABC, NBC, CBS, and PBS, all in 1080i HD.  Don't let a salesman trick you into expensive antennas or hdmi cables.

After waiting for over a week for this new screen to be shipped, it finally shows up..  The local tv guys schedule an appointment with my wife while I'm at work for the new screen to be put on..  I get home from work later that evening..  Sit down to enjoy my LG Plasma, and notice a black piece of something on the left hand side of my screen..  I try to wipe it off, and realize that it is a black piece of LINT stuck between the front panel glass, and the glass and the dialectric layer behind the glass..  Now I'm really getting pissed off..  I call the local tv repair company asking why I had LINT in my television that could not be wipped away..  They then inform me that the screen comes IN TACT, and that it could have only been like that direct from THE FACTORY..  yeah..  This just adds to my already ridiculous situation..  The repair guys come back, take a picture of the lint in my screen to prove that I'm not crazy, And now I'm waiting to hear back from them to let me know when ANOTHER screen will be shipped so they can replace the lint screen with a LINT FREE panel.Oh, and the repair guys left 3 screws loose on the back of my television..Bottom line, If something else goes wrong with this new TV, I will have HAD ENOUGH, and I will be contacting LG for a full reimbursement.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best value out there!", "Author": "Nick \"k96nb01\"", "ReviewID": "R81C23GFOFVOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an amazing TV this is, and what an amazing deal!

I am blown away by how nice this TV is.  The picture is huge, but the TV fits in the space much better than my old 32\" tube TV.  It looks great when it's off, too.I rated the features a little lower, because this TV doesn't do much besides be a TV, which is why it is such a great deal.  My blu-ray player already has all of the other stuff I would need, and seeing as a blu-ray player will be much less costly to upgrade later on, I don't see why you would want a TV with lots of included extra features.The TV is plenty bright, even though it's a plasma, and TV watching during the day does not suffer from noticeable reflections.What else can I say?

That combined with a 10 foot test at a store and not being able to differentiate the 1080p 42\" from this by much sealed the decision. My very small gripes would be that it could use a 4th HDMI these days and the capacitive buttons on the front, while lovely, make groping for them in a darkened room to turn it on virtually impossible.As of this review 6th Avenue still has the best price on this.

I contacted LG support and they told me that while the panel was under warranty, this did not include labor and that there would be a service charge (I believe it was $90 or something like that) just to have someone come out and look at it. If it was a defect, I would be responsible for any labor involved in replacing the panel. I was probably looking at $200-300 to have it repaired.

It was on special and stocked and shipped by Amazon (currently it is OneCall supplying).Pros - It looks stunning with the thin bevel. The image is excellent but I only watch HD content (1080i or 1080p). Colors are vibrant. Combining plasma with a 600 hz refresh rate means it just doesn't blur when watching movies or sports. Huge range of settings to adjust if you are like that, and lots of instructions on the web of where to start. Built in sound is remarkably good considering the tight confines of the case. And it's not too big. The main couch is only about 12 feet from the screen which I wondered might be a bit close - not the case! 60\" might have been pushing it though.Cons - The screen *is* more reflective than some plasmas, but given they're all made of glass you will always get a degree of reflection when exposed to direct light. I mitigated this by installing anti-glare tint on the windows. Apparently it uses twice as much power as a similar sized LCD. But given that the LCDs this size, that offer comparable quality, cost *significantly* more the break even on that efficient-ish LCD surcharge could be 10 years. SD content looks decidedly 'iffy' on large HD screens,  This one is no exception.Apparently the best LCDs are *nearing* plasma quality. Unfortunately they cost 2-3 times what this does.

I've only had it up and running for a few days, but picture clarity is outstanding and colors are so vibrant compared to my old tv that I swear I need sunglasses for this thing even at 8 feet away. My one minor dislike, not complaint, is that the screen is a little glossy, so if you have light reflecting from behind you anticipate seeing it when the screen hits blacks as it will give you that reflection then. I've seen a small hint of images linger, but not for too long at all...however I could see it. Aside from that this tv is well made and has great features etc. Oh yeah, I guess I do have another minor dislike. However, I could be the one mistaken, but so far according to the manual I think I'm right. I can't find a regular RCA (red & white) audio output to send my audio from the tv to my older style sound system. The only audio output this has is the digital output which of course my stereo doesn't have. So if you're in the market for this tv, be sure you have a digital audio input on your stereo or surround sound system as this tv won't have RCA plugs to jack into your system in the older fashion etc. So, for now, I'm really relying on the quality of the speakers built into this system, which so far sound pretty good, but its definitely not surround sound. Remote is a little large, but still...I'm not complaining as it has many functions available. Wallmounting was a breeze with this TV as it only has 4 major screws that are very easy to get to. Stand is suprisingly small for the TV size, but it will give you flexibility on the surface you are placing the tv which is good if you have a smaller stand holding this nice tv up. Hmmm...what else? Not much else to say other than I'm sure you won't be disappointed if you scored this one like I did on a great amazon price!!

I bought this TV in mid June of 2010. Amazing picture when calibrated properly, & when it's working correctly. The problem is that it does not work correctly often enough. I've already had 7 service calls on it, 3 for one issue (lost 1/3 of the horizontal picture) & 4 for another (vertical stripe down the middle of the picture), & it's still broken. I haven't been offered a new replacement, customer service just seems to think replacing parts & coming out to replace more is doing me right. I'm down to waiting for a new panel, but it's not currently available. Ive been told there's no ETA, & also that it might be available at the end of March 2011. I also have 5 malfunctioning pixels, but that's minor compared to the other issues I've had with it.  Another minor issue is that the glass front wasn't cleaned properly before installation so that the inside of it has dirt on it. This is a common problem with their QC & is discussed on many of the electronics forums. Mine isn't as bad as some people have reported. It isn't visible when the TV is on, but some people have reported being able to see it when they are viewing the TV. Sears did the first 3 services & seemed more interested in selling me an overly inflated price-wise service warranty than fixing the TV. Why would I pay Sears for a warranty that's almost as much money as a new set, & after they've proven to me they don't have the competence to fix it properly on the first visit? If it breaks out of warranty I'll put it on the curb on trash day, & take the cash saved to put towards the purchase of another TV. LG has been here the last 4 service calls & the people who order parts for them look up the correct part, then order another part instead. I've had 2 service calls sabotaged by malfunctioning \"new\" parts or incorrectly ordered parts. All this time I've had to take time off from work to be here for the service calls. I would recommend this TV only to someone who is willing to roll the dice on it, but if you have issues with it, you were forewarned. This could have been a phenomenal buy if LG's QC was much better & it worked properly out of the box.Update: It was a fail all the way around. After replacing everything inside the TV, the last piece to change out was the panel. They were on national back order with no due date. LG did the right thing & took this one away. They replaced it with the following year's 3D model, which was an upgrade. Kudos to LG for that. Their customer service is first rate.

I sold TVs for Circuit City for over a year back when a 32\" TV was 700 to 1199. LG was in the market back then and pretty strong; the deep blacks this TV has as well as the automatic adjustment to the room lighting are pretty impressive. The auto adjustment is noticeable but it quickly assumes what it believes is correct. The only thing that scares me is when I have a stationary image on it, even for like 15 minutes, the image is still there very vaguely in the background. After turning off the TV and retiring from the room, it is fine; just keep this in mind if you have a PC hooked up to it or a PS3. The thinness is incredible and the fact of being able to move it pretty easily by yourself is unheard of for a plasma; technology keeps improving I guess. When your shopping for a TV keep in mind the top 3 (other than pioneer) are pretty much considered Samsung, Sony, and LG. If I am not mistaken LG holds the record for the largest LCD made in the world; take a second look at LG, it is definitely worth your time. Lastly, the XD Engine this plasma features makes DVDs look amazing. Watching TV on this thing is a dream, in my opinion some of the 120hz or 240hz Samsungs look surreal; I would definitely pick thing TV over a similar model of LCD 120hz Samsung and easily over a 50\" Samsung plasma.

Getting the free LG Bluray player wasn't a bad bonus as well.We received the first TV relatively promptly (good for a freight service) and upon initial inspection, the TV looked fine. However, once fully unpacking it, I found a rather considerable dent in the lower part of the cabinet, right over the left speaker. There was no evidence of shipping damage (box was undamaged) which leads me to believe it left the factory this way. While it *appeared* to work fine, I wasn't willing to take a risk of problems cropping up later and contacted Amazon for a replacement. After a small inconvenience with Amazon's CS regarding a replacement (I shouldn't have had to go through Executive CS to get this done) one arrived yesterday and appeared to be free of any physical or operational defects. However, after about 2-3 hours of viewing, a horizontal line appeared about 4-5\" from the bottom of the screen. I tried powering the TV off/on, switching inputs, etc., to no avail. While trying to peruse the settings for a solution, the screen flickered and went totally blank, power still on. Now there is no picture at all and LGs best solution is to send a tech out to repair the TV. I should not have to have a $1000 piece of electronics *repaired*within 2 hours of removing it from the box! LG should be sending a tech to my home with a NEW TV, to put it through its paces and ensure it is fully operational before leaving.To Amazon's credit, they offered another replacement, but I'm done with LGs apparently crummy quality control and apparent lack of concern after informing them this was the 2nd TV we had received from them. Their tech support line had a \"who cares\" attitude when we informed them that we were unhappy with their response and would be unlikely to purchase from them in the future as a result. It is going back to Amazon for a refund as soon as they can come pick it up.On a positive note, the picture quality of the 1st TV was great through HD sources. It leaves something to be desired through non-HD sources, but that is more of a result of Comcast's over compressed digital cable signal and not really a fault of the TV itself.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG 50PK550 Review from Plasma TV Buying Guide", "Author": "LCDTVBuyingGuide", "ReviewID": "R2KGD9ARF7QVYH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The 50PK550 is a middle tier 2010 plasma TV offering from LG that includes some nice features and calibration options while leaving off Internet connectivity, 3D compatibility and the best video processing.There are exceptional fine tuning calibration controls on the 50PK550 which is unusual for a TV of this price and feature point. For example there is a 20 point white balance control. Aside from color shift, a professional calibrator can use these controls. However, the average user may not do themselves any favors. The easiest solution? Follow our calibrated picture setting instructions. And make sure to turn the Sharpness down.With 480i DVD content I felt the colors were subdued and the picture a little darker than I liked even though we had contrast at 98%. There was good depth in the picture due to the plasma glass (which also yielded glare) so this TV will be best used in a room with not too much ambient light. Nasty motion artifacts were introduced in facial features in Fargo prior to turning down the Sharpness control.With HD content, the PK550 yielded a much better picture and depth continued to improve. Color rendition was also much richer with the 1080i signal. You will not get away from the color shift issue with this plasma TV no matter what the image. If a white house leans toward pink the effect will be multiplied with the PK500.Black Level/Contrast/Contrast Ratio: Black level was very good at our post calibration settings though we didnt think the PK550 excelled at dark shadow detail. Post calibration checkerboard contrast measured a fairly impressive 1850:1. Interestingly, this was almost 900:1 greater than contrast with the inbuilt Picture Wizard technology.Color information is subdued but comes through fine. However, color accuracy suffers in white and light scenes due to constant color shift with varying degrees of brightness. This is a constant theme for this TV.Aesthetic Considerations: The PK550 is a great looking black gloss TV with a 2\" depth and 1 inch bezel frame on the sides. The top bezel frame is 1 and half inches. The included swivel table top stand is also black gloss and swivels to about 20 degrees left to right. My one complaint with the appearance of the TV is the gray screen when the TV is off. I prefer a black screen.Audio Output and quality was very impressive in the 50PK550 a noted improvement over prior LG models. Even at 10% we could still hear the inbuilt speakers discernibly well from 10 feet. Clear Voice II seemed to work much better than the prior Clear Voice feature. Mid range was was noticeably boosted to enhance voice frequency, so we felt the feature worked well. Rarely have we tested a TV that concentrated on such powerful volume output and especially in the high to mid range. The sound quality does present a hollow and slightly tinny character at times.See the complete review including calibrated picture settings at Plamsa TV Buying Guide", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "The Original Smart Girl \"SS\"", "ReviewID": "RYOEPJA55N3WT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased TV from Amazon and had great customer service.

Basicly the tv looks really good, but...Day 1 i was really happy. when i got home from work and turned it on, I could still see a faded image on the tv from a show I was watching earlier in the day. So if theres a still image on the tv for a while, even as little as ten mins, you can still see it when your on a black or dark screen. However, if i put on a movie for a few mins and go back to a black screen, it goes away. I believe if you watch something or play xbox for hours that has a still image, that its possible for the image to stay burnt in forever.

Consumer Reports rated the LG50PK550 as the best 50-inch plasma.  Having previously followed their advice with regard to LCDs (32-inch Panasonic Viera and 46-inch Sony Bravia), only to have subsequently learned from none other than CR that LCDs unfortunately suffer from a smear factor when confronted with high-speed action, I once again succumbed to CR's prestige and purchased the above-identifed plasma LG TV as a remedy to smears, especially during network-TV coverage of NFL football.  Well, having been in possession of the set for all of one day, I don't know if it de-smears or not.  All I know is that whoever engineered it has to be the biggest nudnik in Korea.  I was just incredulous, after having labored through the standard mind-numbing set-up ordeal, to discover there was no audio-out for headphones.  I'm an oldtimer and have gone through a lot of TVs.  Never have I had a set that did not have an audio-out for a headphone.  When I called customer service, the person I spoke with kept insisting the set had an audio-out--yeah,it does, for amps and speakers.  Great, if you want to make a lot of noise; no help, if you want to restrict the sound to your own ears.  Also, the screen quality you get from the PC input--and I tried all the available resolutions--is, at its best, sadly inferior to what I get from the Sony Bravia's one-size-fits-all resolution paradigm.  So, the LG's picture is good; it's operating system is a bit clunky, especially when it comes to input selection; but if you could care less about audio output or PC quality, it's probably a reasonable buy.
