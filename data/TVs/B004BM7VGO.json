The amount of inputs is great, much better than the new panasonic plasma we got for the living room. Unfortunately that's all the good things I can say about the TV.Out of the box when I hooked it up to my antenna the setup screen comes on and even after going through and setting it up the screen keeps popping up. The unit has bad firmware. So bad that Seiki doesn't even offer an updated version to correct this problem. So after a few hoops I paid to send this unit back to Seiki. They promptly sent me back a brand new version of the same exact TV with the same exact problem. Why they would send a known broken unit as a replacement for a known broken unit is beyond me. I would stay away from Seiki like they were were the undead. If I have to pay to send this back again I'm going to be a good percentage of the purchase price into shipping around broken TVs.

The channel scan menu pops up everytime the TV is turned on and off, additionally, while you're watching TV, another menu continually pops up and blocks the screen.  Seiki is obviously awasre of the problem and has a dedicated webpage just for firmware updates to fix it.  Unfortunately, this model does not have a firmware update online.  After being passed around to several call centers over a week, each with a different answer, I was finally told that I could have my TV replaced with another refurbished TV, but only if I paid to ship my broken (brand new) TV to Michigan.  Rediculous customer service!  I will never buy a Seiki product again, and do NOT reccomend this TV.  Buyer beware.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its not that bad.", "Author": "C.
