{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ultra HD...is ultra special", "Author": "George3mp", "ReviewID": "RDEYDK157KOSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for 2 days and I am amazed at the picture, brightness and great contrast. The black levels are superb and 1080p upscaling is great, even was able to stream Amazon Instant Video wirelessly using -N 5ghz wifi at 1080p and it was like seeing it in person. The 3-D works well even with converting normal 2D shows, and I can't see pixels at all unless I am within 6 inches of the TV.I moved closer to sit within 5 feet specifically for this TV, and it is worth it. Remastered 4K source Blurays look great, and the deep color of this set makes water and trees and depth perception look so real. The local dimming really creates darker shadows and makes dark shows like Game Of Thrones look even more realistic. For example, looking at flickering candles in upscaled 1080p, you can see the blue halo of candle flame tips and the red-orange around the wicks.It was easier to mount as it weighed less than the 46\" LCD older TV I dismounted from the wall...and the side-mounted connectors make it easier to attach more cables.  The speakers may be only 20W but it does sound good, and helped my new 5.1 Home Theater have a little more spatial depth. The Smart TV parts I may not use, but the included apps seem to work well. The Amazon Video app especially does well when streaming.I can't wait for more real 2160p content, what little I have found looks even better and you can see the tiniest details in the videos.There has been no motion-blur I have seen, and the brightness can really fill the room if you set it high.The gun-metal gray bezels do look so different than basic black which do edge the actual screen, and they are not thick at all.  The stand seemed sturdy but I just had to mount this on the wall.The wireless keyboard can be slow to react to keypresses, but that may be a function of range or interference. That is the only imperfection I have found, and I can always connect a USB mouse and a different keyboard if I need them.I would recommend this to anyone, and the 65\" and 84\" versions would just be more greatness.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great UHD for a good price", "Author": "Johnny", "ReviewID": "R3A4Q7QQ3VM398", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV for nearly a week now and it is very sharp.  The upscale of the full HD to UHD is nice and smooth but not noticeable enough on a 65 inch screen from 7 feet away.  It still has the best picture quality of any TV I have ever owned.  The internet TV features are pretty standard and not as fancy as the Samsung interface but it works just fine.  Toshiba stills needs to add the HBO GO app along with many others but I am sure those will be added in time.  The sound is also very average for an LED TV but that is to be expected.  I recommend going with a nice sound bar or a theater surround sound system if you have the resources.The best part about this particular television is the passive 3D.  It is by far the best in home (non-projector) 3D experience that I have seen so far.  The 3D is in full HD (1080p) using passive 3D glasses without the need battery operated glasses (active 3D).  I have owned a Samsung plasma with active 3D and have experienced a lot of ghosting and cross talk with the glasses.  The passive 3D has none of those issues.  The one major drawback to the passive 3D tech is that you have to be positioned as centered (vertically) to the screen as possible to get the best experience.  I recommend this TV to anyone who is looking for a good full HD passive 3D experience for a great price.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "5/5 stars. A great 2nd generation TV.", "Author": "Audio Video Obsessed", "ReviewID": "R1XYEZJHAZ8JT9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is the best choice for anyone that has any light sources whatsoever. The Sony and Sammy are light catchers. I spent two months going to various stores and looking at uhd tvs. The matter of upscaling will be mute soon. This tv does an above average job at it. Technicolor is now certifying products for 4k quality and there will be a plethora of products coming. The Toshiba Symbio Blu Ray Player is outstanding and truly makes blu rays look like native 4k. Google it. It is Technicolor certified. Since there is no content available this development is highly important.The biggest pluses of this tv are : Color - colors pop and are very natural looking. Picture Depth - picture depth is an issue with LCDs and this ones shines. Black Levels - black levels are solid - not outstanding but very good. Size - you get 3\" more than the competitors and a tv for about $300.00 less. Right now that makes this very competitive to me. In addition the screen is semi-glossy which is much better than the high gloss option the competitors have imho. Sony makes a model that is matte. That has it own issues. To me matte screens dull down the picture too much. The semi-gloss screen is a great compromise. Stand - the stand is very well made and the tv swivels. The tv itself to me has much better build quality than other lcd tvs on the market. In truth I would have gone with Sammy over this one but the high gloss screen is a deal breaker. Who wants to see every little light source reflected? My advice - unless you are in the bat cave stay away from high gloss options. I can not say that enough.There is a little blooming but not bad at all. I have a Vizio that is a 8/10 for that - this tv is about a 3 as far as being bad (10/10 would be awful).The 240hz refresh rate ensures no blurring. It helps a LOT.Down the road you will be able to pair this with a Technicolor certified receiver and you have heaven. If you do not have the budget for that down the road this one does a fine job of it until content becomes available. This tv is also perfect for people that like tweaking picture settings. There is also a mode for processional calibration.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 65\" 4k tv- Good 4k tv", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "R1UX4O22Y41RV5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the 65\" version. Its worth the bigger size.This TV did well with 4k photos. Haven't tried to play videos yet using the PC. I wish it could play 4k videos through USB but for now only through computer, ps4, or other external 4k players. The contrast was good. Some slow respond with cloud TV menu, and included keyboard had some speed issues. Once seller amazon on amazon.com has it in stock I wouldn't doubt they will have a lower price than currently. I bought mine on thanksgiving where it was discounted from amazon  to $3400 and the 58\" was $2500.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Toshiba 58L9300 has some distinct advantages over the competition", "Author": "ashtor llc", "ReviewID": "R3NB3PJBM1IZBN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Test Devices:Toshiba: 58L9300 U UDH 4KToshiba: BDX-6400 Media Box DVDSony: SMP-N200 media playerMedia PC: FX-799A-6NF9 4k video adapterWiDi PC: Samsung Series 7 slateMobile devices: Nokia N9 and Nokia 808 pureviewRouter: BUFFALO AirStation Extreme AC 1750Reviewer experience level: Uber, nija, jedi, techie geek.Let me first state, I dislike \u201csmart TV\u2019s\u201d. Basically a \u201csmart TV\u201d is the mash-up of a display and a computer- but think more android tablet then desktop pc. My dislike comes for the fact that 1) it\u2019s a \u201ccrippled\u201d computer and 2) the \u201cuser interface\u201d for smart TV\u2019s \u2013 the remote is the worst way to interface with a computer EVER devised! That said the 58L9300u can be reviewed in two ways, as a smart TV, or as a monitor.Who watches TV via coax anymore? Today very few people actually watch TV as they use to in the \u201890\u2019s \u2013 straight from the cable. The vast majority gets content from a set-top box, or DVR so many people will use the 58L9300 as a \u201cplain TV\u201d \u2013 display and speakers.Cord cutters, if you gave up on the cable companies and you just \u201cwatch the internet\u201d for all your content, you have been doing this via a dedicated Media PC or a Laptop in this case you are using even less of the 58L9300 features and it\u2019s just a \u201cdumb display\u201d and you are most likely routing audio over an AV receiver to external speakers.The 4k issue\u2026 plain and simple. No broadcast content exists- since no stations are delivering it. No streaming content exists since little native UHD format content is licensed for streaming (Netflix has announced future availability).  Little or no disc based content exists because no native 4k \u201cdvd\u201d players exist.  Frankly the 4k UHD standard is so volatile that all manufactures have long legal disclaimers that 4k \u201cmay not work in the future\u201d on their sets. The only place you will find 4k content is the internet and on some proprietary media devices like the Sony FMP-X1 \u201chockey puck\u201d.That said\u2026 The 58L9300 is a fantastic 4k display that CAN \u2013with the right input sources- display stunning 4K UHD content.  Now what do I mean by \u201cfantastic\u201d? Fantastic as in, a great quality display panel, with all the right in\u2019s and out\u2019s, and great hardware. Compared to what?  Compared to anything you have in your home today!So the number one issue for 4k UHD TV buyers is\u2026.. Upgradability! Just like your computer and mobile device, manufacturer support for updating the firmware is KEY!! So the question to ask is 1) does my purchase have the hardware oomph so that it can be upgraded and 2) will the manufacture upgrade me or abandon me?So this isn\u2019t a Chinese knock off set, the 58L9300 has class leading features comparable with Sony, Samsung, LG\u2026 and I\u2019m not going to focus on the \u201csame-ness\u201d of the products, but I will focus on the pluses.Major hardware pluses:These features are important since they are not \u201cupgradable\u201d, the hardware is the hardware.\u2022 It\u2019s a second generation set so it has more cores, CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s them competing sets. It is also an in house chip set that Toshiba uses so they have complete control over the hardware/firmware.\u2022 3 extra inches!!!! Size Matters!!! Really makes a big difference over a 55\u201d display.\u2022 Higher native refresh rate 240 hz then many competitors.\u2022 WiDi support- WiDi is an open standard for wireless transmission of computer display signals\u2026if you never tired it, you don\u2019t know what you are missing. WiDi allows me to display my Series 7 slates screen simultaneously on the 58L9300 exactly as if the Series 7 was connected to the display via HDMI, but WiDi does this over WiFi \u2013 note to WiDi HD with 5.1 audio you need a kick ass router.\u2022 Active Shutter 3D\u2022 Hardware keyboard support \u2013 Yes a keyboard and a touchpad!!!Software Pluses:\u2022 Native DivX Plus HD support.\u2022 Software doubling of refresh rate from 240 to 480 \u2013 important for sports and action scenes.\u2022 Audyssey built in.\u2022 Internet based firmware upgradable \u2013 and we have seen upgrades from Toshiba.\u2022 HDMI CEC and ARC \u2013 the Toshiba CEC version is more open then many, unlike Sony who limits CEC functions to Sony only peripherals\u2022 4K up-scalingOkay so what is the real reason to get the 58L9300 now?  TWO WORDS 4K up-scaling!! Connect a 58L9300 to an up-scaling DVD player or Media box and I will guarantee you the best \u201c2K\u201d 3D movie experience you have ever had in your life!  Take a title like Life of Pi, with the BDX-6400 as the player and the 58L9300 as display the 3D is incredible. \u201c2K\u201d 3D is more impressive than using the same hardware to play a \u201cmastered in 4K\u201d title like Battlefield: Los Angeles- since the \u201cmastered in 4K\u201d is lost when pressing to a BD.Needs Improvement:Not all is perfect\u2026 Now this is very subjective\u2026. My point of view is that any dedicated device will do a better job than a \u201cSmart TV\u201d, hence my old Sony SMP-N200 media player is a better DLNA render then the 58L9300, my media PC\u2019s browser is better than the 58L9300 browser.  So many of the \u201ccomplaints\u201d you hear about in blog posts is that people compare the \u201cSmart TV\u201d functions to the experience on a dedicated device.That said the open standard functions work as advertised; I can easily access music, photos and video wirelessly on both the Nokia N9 and 808 pureview as well as my wired Buffalo Linkstation Pro.  On the Nokia 808 pureview I can connect an HDMI cable directly to the display (Yes, the 808 has an HDMI out) and display the 38 mega pixel pictures on the 58L9300 in 4K UHD.***Note the internal renderer will only render up to HD, NOT UHD \u2013 this is not a display limitation but a renderer function (see section on no 4K standards existing\uf04a).***Also Note the web browser is an open source HTML5 browser\u2026 no current FLASH support! But if you know where to look you can find content to render, again issues here is not display but the app.*** Notable omission- NO Amazon instant video app. (I don\u2019t care since Sony SMP-N200 has brilliant Amazon app, or use media PC).Since I use the 58L9300 as a \u201cdumb display\u201d I have no need for many of the \u201cSmart TV\u201d functions.  But as a whole I think Toshiba could improve on the usability of apps a great deal.Is it the sexiest UDH set? No\u2026 but then again I\u2019m not buying a TV for the thinness of the bezel, or how cool the stand looks, and anyway all my sets are on articulating mounts. The remote is functional- but I never use it due to integration with CEC and AV receiver. I\u2019m also not impressed with the sets sound using the internal speakers, but then again hard for me to judge since I haven\u2019t listened to TV without it going through a AV receiver since 1993.Conclusion:All 4K UHD TV\u2019s are in limbo due to content \u201cun-availability\u201d. BUT both Sony and Toshiba have said that the current gen TV\u2019s will be HDMI 2.0 upgradable via firmware WITHOUT the need to buy an external adapter \u2013 In truth HDMI 2.0 will not really impact most content consumption since most content is shot at 24/30fps which the current crop of 4K UHD TV\u2019s support, HDMI 2.0 biggest feature is support for 4K 3D.The Toshiba 58L9300 has some distinct advantages over the competition; one of the biggest is the extra 3 inches in size. Higher refresh rates. It is active shutter 3D.  Supports such geek features as WiDi. Also it is a more open platform then the Sony when it comes to CEC interoperability. Yes CES is just around the corner, but for the price you can\u2019t go wrong.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV", "Author": "Jeremy J.
