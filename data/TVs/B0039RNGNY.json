The wide viewing angle is also great.-On the quick menu you can easily change the sound between Music and Cinema and I can actually hear the difference. Yes they are tv speakers not surround sound but for my studio apartment it is more then adequate.-I noticed I was getting a little noise on the sound when I had the Clear Voice on but totally fixed it when I put the Auto Volume option on in the audio main menu.-I keep the tv on a lot for music during the day since I work from home and there is this great button on the remote labeled energy where you can quickly adjust from 100% which is the best for viewing to maximum energy saving. I like this not only for the energy savings but also to save the back light from 100% constant use.-I noticed that one of my shows off of my Roku (digital box that streams netflix) wasn't HD and the picture wasn't looking to hot. I adjusted on the picture main menu the aspect ratio to Just Scan and it actually cleaned it up really nicely. This is important,several of my friends have really ritzy tv set ups but if it's not HD the picture is almost unbearable. This one you can watch older movies/tv shows and HD without having to fiddle with everything to get a good picture.-Overall picture quality can be adjusted by so many advanced options that if you play with it I'm sure you can get exactly what you want.-I know it is 720 versus 1080 but at this price range when I looked at the specs if you go for 1080 it seems that you will get dark spots in dark scenes and it's refresh rate will be so low that you will notice it in quick scenes plus the audio seemed unreliable. I think at this 32inch size 720 is really not that noticeable.Very satisfied customer. Only complaint is you need 4 screws to attach the tv to it's base and my baggy only came with 3 in it.  Luckily the hardware store is right down the street so I was able to get something comparable instead of waiting for them to ship it.Do your self a favor, get some good HDMI cables with noise reduction that can handle full HD (found some on amazon for like $7). I haven't experienced any blurring at all on this tv while watching movies/shows like others have commented about. Regular cables don't cut it and you won't want to wait when your tv arrives.Happy Viewing", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simply Awesome!", "Author": "papamac67", "ReviewID": "RLZHE07TE1C17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been waiting patiently for a few years now to make the switch from my 480i Toshiba 32\" CRT to an HDTV. Thanks to  a decent tax return I was finally able to join the Hi Def club. I live in a small apartment and already had a nice entertainment center which housed my aging Toshiba so I chose to stay with the 32\" screen format as anything larger would not fit. After doing weeks of research it came down to this LG or the Samsung LN32C350. I found the picture quality to be almost identical and the price was the same for both, $399.00. I chose the LG because I got 10% off with a online coupon and no tax and free shipping from another online retailer. I couldn't be happier! This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. The TV is fantastic!, picture is bright, sharp, clear and gorgeous. The contrast ratio listed here is wrong though...it's not 50,000:1...it's actually 70,000:1...which is even better. I love the remote, easy to use menu and all the functions and options you can tweak. it's such an unbelievable difference seeing TV shows and movies in Hi Def. I can't comment on the sound as I have the TV speakers turned off because I have a pretty kick-ass surround sound system. I am A Dish Network subscriber and have it hooked to my VIP612 receiver and am loving it...also finally able to play my Xbox 360 in Hi Def and that is Da Bomb too!...BF:BC2 looks amazing! I was debating whether to get a 1080p or a 720p TV for a long time...then I found out (which I didn't realise) all HD TV signals...OTA (over the air), DirecTv, Cable, Dish Network are all broadcast in 720p/1080i...and since I don't watch blu-ray movies...spending extra money on a 1080p set just wouldn't make sense...also...on a TV 32\" or less..the benefits of watching in 1080p are negligible. 720p looks phenomenal! It has a 1 year parts and labor warranty, and after you register it with LG you can extend your warranty by 2 years for $48...provided you do it in the 1st 180 days after purchase, so altogether you get a 3 year warranty for $48...from the manufacturer...not some 3rd party outfit, that's pretty good...I'll be doing that b4 my 180 days are up.

Viveros (Aug 8th) for info on the panel display on this tv***Picture quality on this tv is excellent (it has an IPS panel), black levels are impressive, color is vibrant. And you can tweak the picture to your likeing with a ton of various options. Took me a while to get the picture quality just right for gaming, HD content and SD content. SD tv actually looks pretty good on this tv, suprisingly sharp picture quality on it. Though this being a LCD tv the picture isn't crystal clear, in darker areas you can see some obvious blurring or trailing (but only if you really want to notice, and its not as bad as the latest Samsung), in brighter areas blurring is not noticeable at all (in Modern Warfare 2 for example darker wood textures you can see the blur when moving, on brighter wall textures there is no blur).Speakers are decent, not going to blow you away with the sound but they aren't complete crap either. Like the picture - sound also has various tweaking options.Remote is pretty standard, doesn't look cheap and doesn't go overboard with the options. But is has everything you'd accept to be on it.Also has a headphone jack (and unlike Samsungs you can control the volume of the headphone jack with your remote).You can also display pictures or play music with a usb stick, I don't think I'll be using this feature. Would've been nice if it allowed you to play videos from the usb stick...but they only have that feature on their higher end models.One problem is that if you switch the input to hdmi and then go back to AV or TV input...there is no sound.

We researched 32-inch TVs a lot, and this one seemed like the best for the price. Man, what a lemon. And LG customer service has been really disappointing. The picture went black five weeks after we bought it - just a few days after the 30-day warranty from Future Shop. Future Shop wouldn't give us an exchange, and LG said we had to take it to a repair shop. The nearest one is a 40-minute drive from our house. It was in the shop a month.A couple of months later, the picture stopped working again. LG still won't replace it. So that means another three hours of driving to drop off and return to pick up the TV. The repair shop says LG policy is they won't replace it until after three breakdowns. I could just see that happening a day after the one-year warranty.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great bedroom TV for the money!", "Author": "M.

For the money, this is a great TV even with the lower contrast ratio compared to more expensive models. I typically buy Samsung LCD and LED TVs but the low price of this LG tempted me to try something new and so far I have no regrets. Other reviewers have done a great job at highlighting what is great about the TV so I am not going to repeat what they have already said.I did, however, want to make a quick mention of the resolution. LG says that this TV is only 720p but my PS3 detected it as supporting 1080p. I've heard of people being able to force certain 720p TVs to do 1080p and it appears that this TV is perhaps one of them. I did play a couple of my PS3 games that are in 1080p and the TV did, in fact, run in 1080p looking great so... take that for what its worth.For a TV that can be had for under $400, this is a great buy.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stunning Picture Quality", "Author": "Shekhar", "ReviewID": "R19G8ZJWPU9M3C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV couple of months ago from Walmart. What a stunning picture quality it has. It stood out from all the TVs on display around it due to it's vivid color and crisp picture. We bought it immediately and no regret. We love the picture quality. Sound quality is average as they say how it is in the flat TVs. Hence I bought a home theater system to complement it's picture quality and now we have stunning picture with amazing sound. Watching TV/movies is more fun than ever. With the home theater system, the sound is now balanced and there is no shocking sound level increase during the commercials.The remote is nice and I like the quick setup button which pops up a circular dialogue box on the TV with most frequently used settings.It has two HDMI inputs altough some competition TVs have more than 2 HDMI inputs.

I suppose it was because Amazon did not pack the TV into their standard packing boxes and it'd be a different kind of \"steal\" if left at my apartment building entrance.Setting up wasn't that difficult despite confusing instructions from the manual. Two points to note:1. Have a long-stemmed Philips screwdriver. I had to get a 4-inch stem from the hardware store. Thankfully it was just down the street.2. You can pretty much set up without the manual because there is only one way to fix the TV base (which consists of the flat base and the \"trunk\"). Just match the distance between the screw holes for both parts.The only grouse I have is one missing spongy-rubber pad. There're supposed to be 8 but I had only 7.Auto-tuning was a breeze, after which you can customize sound/picture settings to your preferences. I must say, the \"clear voice\" option is real sweet. So good luck and enjoy your purchase. As with all other electric appliances, they aren't built to last indefinitely anyway as manufacturers need the revenue.

Payne", "ReviewID": "RUXUN95L5PNER", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this LG set as a second TV to replace an old 27\" CRT standard def set. I have not used this LG to watch HD TV or movies, but have used it to play HD games on an Xbox 360. The picture quality during the games is very good. On any 32\" set, I think you'll find a 720P picture to be more than adequate to enjoy the HD picture. Like most LCD TVs I've seen, this set doesn't produce a deep, rich black screen (there's still a little bit of a lightness effect on the default settings on a black screen), but this seems to be standard for LCDs (at least the ones that are not LED types, I haven't seen one of the LEDs up close). Standard def pictures are a little grainy, but this seems par for the course with HDTVs- I've never seen one that looks as good as an old CRT when displaying a standard def picture. I was surprised by the sound quality. When playing Halo: Reach, the simulated surround sound was pretty good - I could hear explosions and dialogue behind me when I was seated in the sweet spot in front of the TV. It's not going to match a separate surround sound system, but its not bad for a \"small\" TV speaker system. My main complaint about the set is that it has only two HDMI inputs, and the stand for the TV was a little bit awkward to screw into place (make sure you have a phillips screwdriver with a decent-length shaft). I definitely recommend this LG for those who want a second HDTV, or for the budget-conscious folks who want a small HDTV and don't care about having all the bells and whistles.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "kitty \"kittyjoy22\"", "ReviewID": "RKVNMVHJC070O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am 63 and technology challenged.

My decision came down to the LG 32LD350 and Toshiba 32C100U. A lot of reviews stated the LG 32LD350 had better color than the Toshiba 32C100U so that made my decision.THE GOODIt was Black Friday and I \"WANTED\" a 32\" LCD HDTV for my bedroom and to dual screen my PC. Anything bigger than a 32\" would be unnecessary since my room is smediumish. When the TV arrived, I had it hooked up to the HD cable to compare 720P vs 1080P (LG 720p vs Samsung 50\" 1080p). To be honest I can't tell the difference b/w the two. Tested in several sport channels ( ESPN 1,2,3,etc...) and movies with mainly 720p and 1080p resolution. The difference is insignificant and not worth the extra [...] to get 1080P. The 32LD350 color is GREAT! picture is sharp and crisp with lots of extra features. BTW, the color needs to be adjusted and this HDTV is rated above mid entry HDTV in it's class.THE BAD & UGLYI didn't expect the sound to blow me away since it's a built in speaker but I didn't expect it to buzz neither. The speaker had this annoying buzz when I'm using it as a primary display for my PC. Almost sound like static and the only way to get rid of it was to turn the speaker off and use a separate speaker. I thought all my problems were solved but oh boy was I wrong. There was another buzz almost like a vibration sound and this time it was coming from the TV itself. Under normal circumstance you won't hear any static from the speaker or vibration from the HDTV if you're watching TV, only if you're connecting it to the PC in a quiet room. If your PC fan is somewhat normal/loud then it'll blend it with HDTV and you won't be affected by it. Those who have quiet/water cool system should look elsewhere.PC ConnectionNative resolution for modern 720p are 1366x768. Windows will only recognize 1360x768 as your native resolution but will also support 1920x1080 (down scale) using a DVI to HDMI adapter. The text will look fuzzy if your using a \"NON NATIVE resolution\". You can adjust the sharpness and use ClearType to remove some of the fuzziness but don't expect it to look like it should.At first, it was annoying, and hard, to get used to 1360x768 when my 24\" Samsung LCD runs at 1920x1200 and Acer at 1920x1080. I knew this beforehand but I decided to go with a 720P anyways. The reason is because my Samsung and Acer is capable of running Full HD so no need to fork extra money. Surprisingly after a day of adjusting Window 7 \"personalize\" setting, I found 1366x768 not to shabby at all. So then I tested out 1366x768 vs 1920x1200 in gaming. Tested on CODMW2, HL2, CSS, Civilization V, and Crysis. Expected the unexpected, I thought there would be a huge difference in textures and details loss due to low resolution but I was wrong again. It might be the way  HDTV scales or what not but overall the good outweigh the bad. Gaming on this TV makes everything look bigger but the details are there compare to my Samsung/ Acer LCD. I've constantly switch the game from one monitor to another to check for details, textures, shadows, etc... and guess what.... \"INSIGNIFICANT\". I was so glad I purchase a 720 instead of spending an extra 150+ for a 1080. Now if your comparing a regular LCD 1366x768 (NOT HDTV) to a LCD with 1920x1200 then the details, textures, shadows, etc... would be significant. I've upgraded a lot of LCD's so I can tell the difference b/w each one. This LG 32\" HDTV is an exception, maybe because HDTV have better scaling or newer technology? Whatever the case may be, the LG 32\" HDTV is now my primary PC display. All my games looks so much better on it than my 24\" Samsung due to better contrast, colors, and and insignificant details loss from higher to lower resolution.To get native resolution (1366x768) to work on your PC you need to install PowerStrip.1. Connect using DVI to HDMI Adapter. Don't use DVI to VGA, text are extremely blurry and custom resolution will not work.2. Update video card driver. Old drivers can be buggy and it'll fail at creating custom resolution.3. Create custom resolution using Nvidia Control Panel or ATI Control Panel. DO NOT APPLY  after creating custom resolution, 1366x768.4. Install PowerStrip and apply custom resolution at display profile.5. To play games using 1366x768 use Power Strip application profile.Why use 1366x768 instead of 1360x768? It's only 6 pixel different right?There is a difference! Not a big difference but a noticeable difference. I tested 1366x768 and 1360x768 on Civilization V. Both resolution give sharp and clear picture but with 1366x768 you can see more details on water, land, and mountains. Definitely noticeable.12/12/2010 - I've successfully exploit the USB port to display DIVX playback.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "GET IT NOW!", "Author": "Raven", "ReviewID": "R32FQZWH79S2AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great tv!Once you get past the setup it's smooth sailing.

Second there are a couple of things to be aware of, especially if you've never had an HD TV before.  If your input is coming from a cable box (learned this the hard way), be sure your box is set to send the right type of signal for the TV.  If, for example, your box is set for 480i output, you will not get the HD.  This is VERY SIMPLE to correct, and if you do not know how, your cable company can walk you through it with a simple call.  Also, don't forget to program the remote for that cable box to match your TV while you've got them on the phone.There is only a \"OPTICAL DIGITAL AUDIO\" output on the back.  This is not the standard speaker connection most of us remember or are used to.  If you get a speaker bar or surround sound system, be sure it has this type of connection.  The only other option is using the headphone jack for computer speakers, and if you do this, you need to get really good ones.  These are much cheaper than a home theater or speaker bar, and depending on your needs, they can be acceptable.Last thought.  My TV is in a corner entertainemnt unit that it fits into perfectly.  Too perfectly.  The power button is on the side/back and if you're tight on space, you'll need the remote to turn it off and on.The price is excellent.

If you're looking for a great, relatively cheap HDTV for a bedroom, dorm room, or even a living room, pick this up\"Pros:- Great picture quality for both SD/HD with complete customization for picture settings if you prefer different settings- Great sound quality; clearvoice is turned off by default but there is a positively noticeable difference when turned on.- Plenty of connections- Looks really nice; I really like the style of LG HDTVs- Built-in cable organizer to hide connection cables- Swivel stand- Comes with microfiber cloth to clean the glossy black surfaceCons:- Many have mentioned the bright red LED that is on when the TV is turned off.  Personally, it's not that bright and it does not annoy me so it's not a con for me.- Channel organization is a little funky if you aren't using a cable box (dorm room for example).  If you enter a channel with the remote, you may not get the channel that you actually want if you have multiple inputs (CATV and CADTV).  This of course is totally dependent on your cable setup.  When you type a channel, a \"similar channel\" list will pop-up and you can navigate quickly for the channel that you want if there are multiple channels for the number you typed.  Sounds confusing if you never had to deal with this before so I will give an example: My SD CNN channel is \"28-0\" but my HD FOX channel is \"28-1,\" so when I type \"28\", it will default to FOX HD.  In order to get to CNN, I will have to type 28 and navigate the similar channels list that pops up.  If this really annoys you, just take advantage of the favorites list.Other thoughts:- Perfect for a dorm room or bedroom or somebody just looking for a relatively cheap HDTV.- I was really surprised how light this TV actually is (I never owned a flat-screen TV before).- Paper manual is useless except for setup and troubleshooting.  If you are looking for a guide on most of the TV's features, look at the CD manual.- MAKE SURE that you have AT LEAST a THIN 4 INCH PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER for assembly (I'm talking to dorm room kids specifically).  I have a \"6 in 1\" screwdriver but the shaft was too wide to fit in the slot for the stand.  It should be no thicker than a standard No.2 pencil.  If you don't, you'll get the TV and then have to get a screwdriver to make sure it is 100% secure instead of watching the TV like you have been itching to do.Not much else to say.

It was the lowest price I found for a TV of this size and quality.  I did a few weeks of research and determined this unit had the features, quality, and price that I was looking for.  This TV will be used for a bedroom and it's just the right size; not so large as to look overwhelming and big enough to provide a easy-to-view image.TV was easy to setup, all you need to do is attach the pedestal base, for table-top use, or snap in a cover if you're going to mount on a wall.  LG's initial setup screen is simple and easy to follow.  You're presented with various screen options (brightness, color, contrast, etc.) along with images of what the ideal setting should look like so you know what effect your changes will have on the image.I have Dish Network and simply attached the Dish receiver to the TV via HDMI.  The LG remote is nicely laid out and allows quick access to the various TV's settings.  I've found that after the initial setup and a few hours of TV watching, I had to make a few tweaks to the color and contrast settings to get the image just the way I wanted it.  That was expected and the tweaks were minor.  The image quality is very good.  I also have a Vizio 32\" LCD and this unit's picture quality is just a bit higher than the Vizio.  I would recommend this unit for a casual bedroom or small-room gaming environment.UPDATE 12/1/10: After using this TV for a few weeks, the only thing I wanted to add to my review was my dislike of the way the red power light, on the lower right-hand side of the unit, stays lit when the TV is off.  There's no way that I've found to turn this light off or dim it.  It's not obnoxiously bright, like my previously owned Vizio which would keep it's logo lit with white light at all times, but you will notice it if the TV is close to your bed (assuming it's placed in a bedroom).  When the unit is powered on the light turns blue and remains on.  When using the remote control, the blue light blinks with every button press.  Why do that?  I have several LCD TV's by different manufacturers and no other unit does this.  It's strange but only slightly annoying.

It finally narrowed down to this LG 32LD350 and a comparable Panasonic. The higher contrast ratio, the headphone jack (for alternative sound connection), the RF connector (antenna only -- no cable in my rural location) and the \"Clear Voice\" feature swung the decision in favor of the LG.Assembly was quite simple, as was setup. I found the default color settings to be very good.  There are no viewing blind spots anywhere in the bedroom.  I used one HDMI to connect a Panasonic DVR/VCR; the second to a laptop for streaming shows from the web; one of the AV's to an old VCR; and the RGB to a DVD player/VCR combo.The \"Clear Voice\" is an amazing improvement.  My wife's hearing loss had resulted in having to listen at an uncomfortably high volume -- no more!  Another nice sound feature is the option that equalizes volume between commercials and programming.  Now I don't have to wait for Congress to enact a law to force this issue.At the time of ordering, shipment was stated as being one week from order date.  As it turned out, order on Thurs 5PM, received on Saturday Fedex, and that was with Super Saver shipping.  I'd say that's excellent service.One more thing that I haven't seen any comments on: Did you know that prices fluctuate almost like the stock market?

I am no stranger to LCD TV's.  In 2004, I began the quest to transition to LCD.  It cost me $3600 at Circuit City to buy two 22\" units!  More recently, I purchased a 37\" Philips which broke down during the warranty.  It went into a local repair shop for 2 months, battling Philips to make good on the warranty. Finally the TV was returned to us, only to have a real nice new problem where it went off and on constantly.  Philips agreed to replace it after weeks of calling, but did not have any 37\" LCD TV's refurbished so a 42\" Plasma was sent instead.  Junk.  It too stopped working after 4 months.  Here is a nice thing they don't tell you: If your new TV has a 1 year warranty and breaks after 3 months, and replaced with a refurb, the refurb only carries a 90 warranty. They will not honor the 1 year warranty or even the remainder of that one year that came on the original set!!OK, sorry I deviated from the subject of the LG350, a 720P, 60Hz machine.  For the money, this is a superior machine.  Depending on what website you look at, the dynamic contrast is either 50,000 to one, 70,000 to one or even 100,000 to one.  Regardless of that gray area, all websites claim it has a 4MS response time (how long it takes for one individual pixel to go from one color to another.  This specification is another gray area and is not always specified on many LCD TVs, and usually for good reason...because it is probably a higher number (lower is better on this one).  What this one technical attribute means is the difference between seeing the Boston Celtics on a FAST break, or seeing them shimmy down the court.  In other words the TV's with higher response times do not handle fast motion very well and like my junk Philips plasma, it is the difference between enjoying whatever your watching or being distracted by the picture's flaws. This LG350 has THE lowest response rate of any 32\" HDTV I have found.  And trust me, I looked at them all!Beyond the great picture (color, contrast, brightness), the sound is excellent for 14watts of output.  The menus are all easy to manage, the stand swivels, it does closed captioning, several color temperatures, several different picture modes (sports, cinema, etc).  I almost forgot a very important benefit of this TV: I have TW Cable, expanded basic so most channels are analog with a handful of digital channels.  The analog channels look very good but the digital channels are excellent...crystal clear.  It has a goodly amount of inputs including USB to display video from a camera or digital photos (it has a neat thing to enhance stills called Picture Wizard).It has a quality look and feel to it and even though it is not 1080P, it is really a very nice HDTV for the money.

Decided on the LG 32LD350 after originally deciding on the Panasonic counterpart and realizing almost too late that there was no analog audio support with that model, neither a PC audio in or headphone jack.So I quickly shifted my interest to this model and pulled the trigger. It arrived today, I couldn't be happier with this purchase.After reading some reviews I was a little worried about how difficult it would beto screw in the base with my very unsophisticated screwdriver - no problem at all.In fact, the entire set up from the time I opened the box to getting it up and running was approx. 10 minutes.I am a student - got rid of cable TV to cut down on expenses months ago - but I have adigital antenna; easy to plug into the TV and the quality of picture exceeds my expectation - a wonderful picture - and I believe the TV is working with the antenna better than its protege..I've got a 13\" macbook hooked up to the RGB plug on the back of the LG 32\",the picture originally was disappointing but after a moment of fumbling (just a moment), the menu guided me to an auto adjust feature and bam - a very satisfactory picture.I have a DVI to HDMI cable being delivered tomorrow so I hope to eek out a bit more definition, so I'll let you know how it goes.Even the audio is adequate - although I hooked up some nice speakers without any trouble and have a connector to the laptop that integrates the audio. I'm happy to reiterate what many many others have said, that for the price this is a real find. My grandmother had a 42\" before she passed that must have cost 3x the amount of this TV and I believe in my short assessment that the quality of her picture was inferior to this.

I only had 'regular', non-HD TV's before this, so the difference with the LG HDTV is incredible.  For a very reasonable price, this was a tremendous upgrade.  The picture is stunning, even on regular channels.  We hooked it up to my step-son's blu-ray player (high def DVD's) last night, and that was even more amazing, clear and vibrant. I think the sound is wonderful; lots of sound separation and dynamic range (especially on DVD's).  It has a 'home theatre' quality even without all the external speakers.  (I have to say that my step-son, who is much more sophisticated in such matters, rated the sound as 'OK - for built in TV speakers'.)

I am not much of a TV Guru nor do I know a whole lot about it, but I do know enough to tell what makes a television suck. This TV is a great purchase considering the price. It's features are pretty nice, and if you are new to the world of HD televisions it's not too bad to get used to.The features it includes is a filter mode which shifts the settings to a couple of predetermined ones so if you're not wanting to spend alot of time to tweak your tv with all the settings this is the way to go. Also, this comes with an \"input\" mode which you can use to the various kinds of inputs this tv supports (composite, AV, DVI HDMI VGA). This is good for if you use this machine to watch cable television and quickly switch to one of the other outputs. If you're a gamer this is a nice feature. Moreover, each input method will hold whatever filter settings (maybe others too but I haven't tried that yet) you assign it. So your cable input method could be set to \"Cinema\" filter while your composite input could be set to \"Game\" filter(which is my setup currently). Also you do have a \"favorites\" channel list you can program you feel like it, and there is a feature that will search for all your channels (TV, CATV,HD channels etc). Just be aware this could take awhile if you plan to do it through the automatic channel search.The sound quality is quite good. The only downside (as mentioned in a previous review) I can think of is that the speakers don't blast forward: it's back and downwards. All the same, the sound quality is quite good (and a welcome change to the mono sound of an analog tv).The TV itself is pretty solid. Although if you put it together with the default base it comes with you might have a wobbly tv. You can rotate the tv just a bit if you install it with the default base, but it's quite wobbly.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I discovered a \"Dead Pixel\" (more technically a \"lit pixel\") on my display about a week or so after I purchased it.

I have a Playstation 3, laptops, desktops, and netbooks; I'm also a bit of an audiophile, so I hope my review is credible. I purchased this HDTV in February of this year. It came well packaged and everything worked when I turned it on. The first thing I want to say is this: this is an HDTV so in order to utilize the HD abilities of this TV, you need to look at HD content or hook-up peripheral devices via HDMI. Otherwise, it will look like any other TV. With that said, lets review this TV based on these HD qualities.HD Channels look stunningly beautiful! I bought my PS3 the same time as I purchased this TV. I hooked it up via HDMI (another note: the better your HDMI cord, the better the picture...just saying) and I watched The Dark Knight in Blu-Ray, just to test the picture quality. I'm not over exaggerating when I say that the picture is so beautiful, it would make you want to cry :). There are also different picture modes to choose from, so if the picture doesn't look as well as you would like it to, the different picture settings should help. I just built my first Desktop and it has HD capabilities, so I tested it on my TV....gorgeous!The sound. It's great! It can get really loud. I never put it above 35. I'm sure that in a bigger room it would need to be turned up more. I have this in my room. All of my friends are envious of my TV...they all have tube TVs in their dorms :). My father bought the 1080p version of this TV...lemme tell you now...don't. All that cute little yahoo internet and stock stuff is for show...it's a nice wasteful feature but the picture doesn't look any better then my TV. Honestly, I think my TV looks better. Blu-Ray on the 1080p LG TV looks fake...if that makes sense. It's pretty bad...don't waste the money. 720p is great. My desktop and PS3 can spit out 1080p...and I've seen 1080p...honestly no difference.This TV is of great value...there are plenty of HDMI slots. You can have a desktop, cable box, and gaming system hooked-up via HDMI. It has an optical out port...which is useful for a home theater system. It's an amazing TV, I adore it and I wouldn't trade it in for anything else.Final note, don't waste your money on an 3D television, wait for it to be standard like the HDTV. It's a waste of money, and the 3D isn't really that good. Plus, you will have to shell out lots of money to even buy the 3D movies...there isn't enough out yet to support the TV...don't do it.

I think the TV is excellent for the price we paid (<$400).  The picture quality is amazing on the HD channels of our local cable company.  Some images look as if they're in 3D, they're so crystal clean with amazing color and egdes.  Some channels look like they're 1080 rather than the 720 then this TV is set for.  The menus are easy to use and figure out.  Set up was a cinch (EXCEPT for the stand which is an extremely poor design -- VERY difficult to get two of the screws to lineup and took us longer to accomplish this than set up the TV, connect it to the cable box and find our ideal settings).  The CLEAR VOICE option is great, and I like that you can turn it on or off, and adjust the level at which you want the clear voice to be heard.  I've picked up lines in movies I've seen hundred of times that I'd never heard before!What I don't like about the TV is that most of the sound settings sound a little \"canned\" or hollow.  For example, when set to the CINEMA setting, I don't detect any obvious difference from the SPORTS or GAMING or even my PERSONAL?USER SETTINGS.  There's an echo or emptiness to the sound.  I know I can purchase a sound system and/or higher quality speakers, but I don't want to spend addtl money for better sound.  Overall it's good sound quality, but I wish it sounded more solid and around me.I also don't like the fact that there's no CAPTION option when using an HDMI or Component Cables.  The only way to access the Caption feature is to use the Antenna input.  This seems more like a downgrade rather than an upgrade from our previous TV.  I prefer to watch television with the captions on, and while I can turn them on through our cable box, I'd prefer to control them through the TV along with the volume and picture features.Overall, very happy with the TV and while this was our first LG purchase, I'm certain it won't be our last - I'd highly recomment LG for your next TV", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Stain", "ReviewID": "RAUGT1R3QC61G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this hooked up last week.Pros:1) Picture is SUPER awesome.2) It weighs about as much as a postage stamp...I swear I could stick it to the wall with a piece of scotch tape.3) The 14-day price guarantee from Amazon saved me almost 30 bucks.Cons:1) When the TV is off, a red light glows on the lower right corner of the front panel.

You will need a phillips screwdriver at least 4\" long to assemble the stand (quick n easy chore) The set up is also simple (clock, channel scan etc.).The remote is sturdy, not flimsy it's functions are well thought out ... logical. There are eight custom image settings you can program: sports, vivid, cinema etc ... you can swap between them quickly to find the best image for what you are watching. 20 watts going to the speakers and they sound good, no thumping bass but not tinny weaky squeaky, volume can be turned up pretty loud if needed. I'm happy with the TV though there are somethings this one lacks maybe because it is a lower end product and features are where they shave the prices....There is no option to see a channel guide it will only show information for the program you are currently watching (if you change the time ahead it will show you future programing). There is no way to have the image fill the entire screen when watching 480i or 720p broadcasts, which seems odd, don't other tv's can do that? As a computer monitor with windows XP and my old agp w/DVI out graphics card there is no way to set custom resolutions so it is a few pixels off, causing slightly fuzzy images but text on web pages/games is easy to read none the less.Further information on this can be found in this helpful review:http://218.201.42.40:8080/www.amazon.com/review/R3CSLGZUZ24HDJ/ref=cm_srch_res_rtr_alt_1With window7 I believe resolution are set correctly automatically ... anyone know for sure?I would recommend this set if it is a fit with your budget, but I do wish it had an onscreen program guide like my DTV box did.

The warranty is one year. About a month after the warranty expired, my LG 32LD350 began randomly turning itself on and off. Once it turned itself off, it could not be turned back on with the remote or the on-off button on the unit itself. The only way to turn it back on is to unplug it, wait for a minute or so, and then plug it into the power outlet again. But that only works for a few minutes and the problem re-appears. According to postings on various discussion boards, this is probably caused by a defective power supply or circuit board. I called LG customer service and the representative said it is likely a defective power supply, but because the problem occurred more than one year after the purchase date, there was nothing they would do for me. (The first LG service representative I spoke to said it was not a common problem. However, a quick internet search turns up plenty of discussion board posts identifying this problem.)During the year that I was able to use this television before it failed, I had to use two remotes: The LG remote control for volume and on-off (menu options), and the Comcast remote for channel changing.

You can't see it so much sitting 10 feet away, but when you walk up to them you can see a snow storm of pixels swirling. This TV and the Panasonic were the only ones without this problem.- Brightness is spot on. Great picture,colors, and blacks/whites. You can also switch between lighting conditions at the touch of a button... on the remote!- Sound quality. I was going to buy speakers and when I got home I found a setting to broaden the sound. I was wowed. No need for speakers, this thing actually sounds awesome!- LG is a good company on the move. They are trying hard to be the best in every industry they are entering. I needed some customer service and had my issues dealt with in one call. Very happy with their customer service!If you are looking for an HDTV at an entry level price with all of the features of the big boys this is the TV. If you didn't tell people it was 720p they wouldn't have the slightest clue. One of my friends who comes over for Monday Night Football was shocked when he saw the 720p on the bezel.

I only bought the LG because of the fantastic price I got (about $200 less than the current price!) but I must say it's the best t.v. purchase I've ever made. I have a Samsung 1080p, and the picture quality of this LG is at least as good! (For those of you shopping now, only blue-rays are actually 1080p. Your dvd's and \"HD\" cable/dish broadcasts are not 1080p, so if you can save money, buy 720p. Your eyes cannot tell the difference.) As far as the sound, get used to it kids, flat screens don't have the space or the inherent accoustics of a large-box old-fashioned t.v. The sound on this unit is 10 times better than on my big Samsung, which has pretty-much blown speakers after 2 years. The LG has twice the speaker output, more options and better, clearer speakers. Also, the LG has more inputs for component/composite stuff (like video games). But most importantly, now that it's out of warranty, it still works like brand new, unlike my first flat-screen, a Polaroid that expired about two days after the warranty!

The TV was easy to set up. I had to tweak the picture to make the football games come alive. I am really impressed with the picture for the price. Football games are great but basketball games don't measure up as well. During bball games, the fast motions cause a slight blur around the players. I think this is common for LCDs and less-so for plasmas. But during football games the blur is not an issue.

Yes, the SD could be better, but you can always change the ratio to the 4:3 format.The screen has hardly any glare, which is a plus.The power light at the bottom is NOT a big deal. If that light bothers you, then you aren't paying attention to the TV show. I never notice it while I'm watching TV. And no, there is not an option to turn the light off as far as I can see. But it is helpful to see if your tv is off or not.I don't like the Picture Wizard as much as I thought I would, but the Energy Saver is great! I have it on Medium, to have it OFF would be really too bright for me.SD is also good, on some things, it almost looks like HD. DVDs are almost Bluray quality, but not quite. Yes, when it is paused it doesn't look like a high quality picture, but why would you want to pause anything on this tv? Sports look pretty good, not really any blur, unless you try to look for it.Now, the bad. The power can shut off to this thing!

Set up was easy, I'm not a techie(?), so ease of set-up is critical for me.  Also, all the channels and what-not work, without having to call the cable company; whether this is a part of the TV tech I don't know, but I think all aspects of the purchase should be reviewed.  Arrived in 3 days of order from Amazon (free shipping!). Picture is great, have it set on Vivid, and it is Vivid!The Sound is fine!  It's not like a surround sound, of course, but definitely decent enough for me.  Better than expected, the sound is totally adequate.I bought this TV for my bedroom, size is fine, I view from about 10ft.  Hooked up my ancient RCA plugs DVD/VHS player, and picture is so much better,plus a cheapie surround sound, all work fine. Price was $309, down from like $450, which is what moved me to go ahead and BUY, after much consideration.  A 32\" HD with all the features, etc for $300 is a good deal, if all works as it should. I'll update this review in a few months.I truly researched this TV, a friend has an LG and is happy with hers(larger model).  Models can vary within brands, one model great and another full of probs, but so far this one is fine.  The only reason I don't give this TV 5 stars is because the Owners DVD arrived cracked; plus, as happy as I am, it's not fantastic, and too soon to give  5 star review.  I was fortunately able to copy the DVD, even with the crack, but a replacement may not be available, only option to return the whole TV, which I will not do.  I chatted with Amazon,  they are trying to get me a replacement DVD, and offered tech help if needed, which isn't. I've been buying from Amazon from their beginning, when all they sold was books, and definitely give Amazon and their customer service 5 stars.  I left packaging feedback.I'm still tweaking, which is easy, the menu is easy to use, I'm very happy.  If the TV holds up, I definitely recommend, and will add a star if possible.4/28/2011I'm adding a star because after over a month my TV is doing great!  Highly recommend for a midsize TV.  I can turn the power usage down to low for late night falling asleep(we pretty much keep the TV on 24/7, what dopes!), I've hooked up my Sony 5.1 surround sound and am totally happy with this purchase. DVD's are outstanding. The menu is simple, pic is fine for a 32\" 720p, sound is satisfactory w/out the surround sound.  If it holds up, I'll keep commenting.6/11Still holding up just fine! Added a cheapie LG Blu ray player for around $80, hooked up w/ HDMI, all works fine and dandy....DVD's are better, sharper, very satisfied.  Cust Svc isn't terrific, but haven't needed it except to ask about diff model/larger TV's.2/3/12....screen has developed a \"stain\" in the lower rt corner, encompassing about 1/4 of the total area.  It only shows up when the background is like sky or solid, light...but makes me think twice about whether I'll be buying an LG for my next big screen.  Stain is usually not visible, as background is usually not clear (sky, clouds, solid background), but it's there.Removing a starSvc Tech fixed prob before warranty ran out (barely made it), gave me an attitude about difficulty in \"seeing\" the stain, (What stain, I don't see anything)\", replaced panel, but acted like I was maybe a little out of my mind for wanting the prob fixed at all.  Sure, I should wait till the warranty runs out and the prob gets really bad, then just buy a newer, bigger and more expensive LG TV, and leave the tech to more serious probs, like explosions.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "G.

All in all very pleased with this tv. It stays on when I am sleeping also.I got my LG tv on sale from Walmart for $218.00. I paid $20 more for mine at Walmart plus $40 some dollars MORE for Sales Tax... I researched and AMAZON has a HUGE savings with FREE SHIPPING and NO SALES TAX of a savings of more then $60 BUCKS!!!!I decided to pick up two 32\" tv's including the Phillips and LG models from Walmart. They were exactly the same price and I needed two and couldnt decide between them. The LG retailed for just $20 higher then the phillips but was on SALE and so they were the same price. Do your homework and you will see that Amazon has the best price and they also have great customer service with fast free shipping.I have always bought Phillips and have had no problems so I was unsure how I would like the LG. It looked slightly more appealing then the phillips, just slightly. I dont know why because they are both LCD and with the same demensions. I also own a Sharp LCD TV and love it just as well as I do both of these models! The price was about the same as the no name brand models which means years of more use.They have both been great LCD TV's so far! You may be curious on which one I like best. I like the LG better so far because of the better remote with more features plus sound boost which so far I have not been able to find with my other one. The picture quality is also slightly better. Its actually a perfect picture!!!! I hate having to compare the two because I do love my Phillips TV almost just as much but being that the both cost the same, then the LG is the way to go. Better picture with slightly more features.I also like the cute LG colored logo that pops up and moves accross the screen when your tv is in standby, which obviously no other LCD TV has!!The sound quality is great for me, not over the top. If you want something over the top then buy a surround sound to use with it or buy a different tv then both of these models. I am satisfied with the crisp sound and clear picture!!! There is also a neat technique where you can customize the image as to how you like it to be shown. The tv is really easy to use and opperate and it is a great value for the price paid. In the future if I have any problems then I will edit my review accordingly.I had no problems with the ease of use, besides the stand that came with the tv was slightly difficult for myself to put on but being a younger in experienced female maybe that was why I had the trouble. The stand that came with the phillips tv seemed slightly easier to install but still difficult for me to put on as well.It may not be important to many people but I also think that this LG has a better physical appearance then almost any other LCD TV I have ever seen! It is very stylish. It has been a great Television that I hope to enjoy for many years to come. :)The stand swivels and appears sturdy to me. I have a lot of cats and they have scared me twice by attacking the tv and it did NOT even fall... One of my cats was standing on it and slid down the screen.. Even with my wild rambunctious cats, the tv has not fell. I have been meaning to find a way to rope it but so far havent done it and I am thankful that the tv stand has held the tv as well as it has.Some have complained about the on and off light being too large. It is not really bright and there are no problems for me... I dont think of that as being a con. I did not notice it until I read a review on here which mentioned it. There may be away to turn it off and so if that bothers you, look into that on your menu.I loved that the tv was so quick and easy to set up the color and sharpness on the screen... Took a couple of minutes and helped you to set it up and turned out to be perfect now. I am still suprised at how well the clarity is on this tv. No matter where you put it the screen is just so beautiful and clear. You will notice so much more in the background when watching your favorite dvds, movies or shows then on some other lcd tvs that are the same price and size.The price of this tv has dropped dramatically in the past year so take advantage of the great deal Amazon is offering this tv!! It will cost about the same as a standard definition tv of the same size and lesser quality.

Took a lot of time to research and choose this one. 32inch size is perfect for my 876sq foot 1 bedroom apt. I bought it about 4 months ago. Picture is absolutely breathtaking-when viewing something in HD (such as off the blu-ray, or netflix streaming in HD, or cabel program in HD). If it's not coming through in HD (still about 50% of movies & programs out there), then the picture is like any old regular tv. The thinness and lightness of the TV is excellent. We bought 2 HD cables: one for the cable box and one for the Playstation 3. The wall mount we got at Ikea, saying it will work on any 32inch flatscreen, did NOT work on this TV (we got an experienced installer to tell us this). So we still don't have it hung up. The only bad thing about this tv is the sound- we have to play with the volume on every show and movie, and sometimes even multiple times within the same movie. IT's too loud at times, or not loud enough at other times. Over the past couple of months, this has become very annoying. Apparantly everyone these days uses some external, surround sound system with their HDTV, and that's why this is not an isue for them. But we are simple people who were relying on being able to use the speakers that came with the tv, but that's not working out well. At first I thought this an insignificant issue, but over time it's really dissapointing to pay about $450 for a TV that has such poor sound quality.

The picture is as bright and clear and colorful as the trinitron, and the images are sharper.It takes all of the older inputs (VCR, DVR) with no problem. This was one of my primary concerns, as we still use many VHS tapes and DVD's. The LG seems to upgrade the quality of the older media as it looks better than it did before. The non hi-def cable stations look pretty scratchy, but when run through the tuners on the vcr or dvr the picture clears up noticeably. The Hi-def cable stations look stunning. I can see a blu-ray in the near future, but for the things already in the library, this works great.I have not noticed (yet) any blurring or picture issues allegedly associated with the 720p v. 1080p. For our family's viewing, and the fact that it's a 32\", this level of resolution will be fine. If I upgrade to a larger format, somewhere down the line, I'll get the 1080p.The sound is nearly as good as the Trinitron. Stereo is good and overall the sound is fine. If the film has really rollicking sound I want to hear really loud, I run it through the home stereo. Just as I had done with the Trinitron. I would buy this product (or one like it) again.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT....", "Author": "PRENEWGLOBAL", "ReviewID": "R3J7Q6ORPQMGOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I WAS LOOKING FOR A VERY NICE 32 INCH HDTV UNTIL I STUMBLED AT THIS....ITS GOT AN EXCELLENT PICTURE QUALITY, SOUND IS AWESOME AND A SLEEK DESIGN....THERE IS NOTHING LIKE MY LG....I LOVE IT.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "mi opinion", "Author": "Aura Oropeza \"v.t\"", "ReviewID": "R2OP9HAOD8J6RK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "yo compre este producto de amazon y realmente me encanto. es como yo lo queria he imaginaba, con el inico problema que me llego sin la base para pararlo.todo me a funcionado a la perfeccion. lo recomiendo cien porciento", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this TV", "Author": "Amy M", "ReviewID": "R1Q7YA7CAWAMRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this television for Christmas.

The controls are very nice, but there could be some improvements to functionality, such as being able to sequence through favorite channels only instead of all channels.  Instant channel changing would be nice instead of a delay. The TV is an Energy Saver, which is very nice.  I looked at energy saver TVs first when buying.  The higher the energy saving setting, the lower the brightness essentially is what happens.  Maximum energy savings to me is unacceptably low brightness.  Medium isn't too bad in my usual low light condition.The sound is adequate.  To me, if I want superb sound, I can just plug in a sound system, which I may do eventually.  The sound output is only of the cable type 'optical audio'.  If you need to hook up your sound system make sure it has an optical audio input or look for an adapter to your sound system input type.  Adapters are apparently pretty inexpensive.Overall, I'm very pleased with it.  Setup is simple, picture is great to me, and sound is fine.  Energy saving is a great plus.

Ordered it at 12:30 p.m. and it was shipped {free, I might add} before 4 p.m.Out-of-the-box factory presets looked great. Played with the adjustments, and wound up back at the presets. The on-screen menu is simple and easy to use. The remote has one-button access to any adjustment needed more often. My one and only complaint? The 'level sound' that is SUPPOSED to keep the commercials from blaring isn't great. It helps, but it is far from consistent. I blame the advertisers more than the TV, but it doesn't work as labeled.Overall, 5 out of 5 for everything but the 'level sound'.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Why did I take so long???", "Author": "B.

Karrow \"car camper\"", "ReviewID": "R1C5USMQQLSSTU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did not buy on Amazon, I bought from another reputable vendor.  My item arrived DOA.  This review, unfortunately, is not of the product, it didn't work, and instead it is of LG's customer service department.For the last 15 years I have been responsible for acquiring technology goods and services for fortune 250 companies and I have seen DOAs repeatedly.  When my clients ask if they should return the DOA or damaged item to the vendor, I explain that due to the size of these items, the hassle of packing, wrapping, and shipping the DOA or defective item; and the possibility of having to wait for the item to be returned before a replacement product can be shipped (however, approximately 68% of the vendors I recommend will ship a replacement item prior to receiving the broken one)  (not sure what Amazon's policies are on this) they should always contact the manufacturer for service related issues. The manufacturer prefers to have you contact them; many even go so far to say \"DO NOT RETURN PRODUCT TO STORE CALL TECHNICAL SUPPORT\" (actual language).So, here comes the meat of my review, which is on LG's customer service department.  I firmly believe that the customer support you receive for a product is one of the most critical elements that needs to be considered when making a technology purchase.  And, when things go wrong with technology, as we all know they do, how the manufacturer responds will then be really important.I will now lay out the problems I had with LG customer/technical service.The item arrived DOA two weeks ago.  I called LG and told them that I had a DOA on my hands.  They said that they couldn't locate a repair facility in my location and that they would find one that could service my TV, then saying \"this will take 3-5 days\", day 5 came to a close without a peep from them so I called and was told, the first person I spoke with was wrong, it really takes 5-7 days to find a service center.  Now remember these 7 days is to have a \"repair specialist\" attempt to identify a service center that can fix the TV, they don't even have to be an LG dealer.  Considering that any one of us can use google and locate a repair facility, or at least identify that there are none that are either a) close, b) willing to perform a house call, or c) willing to work for LGs reduced rates.  To me, this whole process should NOT take 7 days.  It turns out that the average time is 3-5 according to a manager of the executive service department.  So.....here it is with 10 days gone by without me being able to watch my new TV.  I ended up contacting the company that sold me the TV and am returning it.So, in summation, LG makes fantastic products, I have many in my house and cabin; their customer and technical service department and policies are lacking.  If you are concerned about how long you will be without your TV if it fails under warranty think carefully before buying an LG.  This is not an isolated instance of poor service and/or non customer friendly policies. Below are two links to other individuals that had issues with LG service.  I only looked for 3 minutes, I am sure there are more out there.  LG gets high marks on most sites, but I am willing to bet that's due to the fact that DOAs are not common.http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0GC8JIKN2SV/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R2I0GC8JIKN2SVhttp://www.amazon.com/LG-32LH30-32-Inch-1080p-Gloss/product-reviews/B001V5J7OI/ref=cm_cr_pr_hist_1?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&filterBy;=addOneStar.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stop working after 1 day", "Author": "Ronen Hazan", "ReviewID": "R3TQBJ1VZYQSB6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It looks like a great TV.
