Yeah, I had the same thoughts. Even with a few bad reviews (over the sound quality from the standard speakers, which were right on cue, you'd need a surround sound/external speaker setup) I still dove in after the \"deal,\" however the phrase, \"you get what you pay for,\" really fits well. I had this t.v. for a mere month and one week before it decided to simply shut off, with no warning, and wouldn't recognize any power whatsoever. If you are on a budget, but want a large flat screen, don't settle for this t.v. You'll want to spend the extra 100 bucks to get a better brand. (Proscan = R.C.A. by the way) If you want to get a good quality 50+\" television, be prepared to spend no less than around 600$, because the quality under that isn't worth the money.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you buy, get an extended warranty", "Author": "Rose Ferguson", "ReviewID": "R45BHNZ7N3YP5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We bought this TV in April and within a week the screen went crazy.  Took it back to ABC and got a new one. Also bought the extended warranty. The picture on this TV just went out, so back to ABC.  Ps, the sound for me, no matter how I adjust is annoying. We had to buy a sound bar to fix it.

We also connected our new Blue/Ray DVD and boy the picture is great!!!! I will however get the extended warranty because nothing is guarantied.
