Lee \"The Beast\"", "ReviewID": "R36S0YS0565XX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been considering the 46V2500 for some time now. After reading the extensive forum thread on AVS as well as checking the monitor out for myself in stores, I was convinced this was the monitor for me. For those of you who are considering the XBR2/XBR3 sets, the only MAJOR differences include the glass bezel and a few additional internal settings and features (some that you probably won't even utilize much less care about). The V2500 series uses the same exact LCD panel as the XBR series. Justifying the price hike between the V 2500 and the XBR units is a matter of personal preference aesthetically. Performance-wise, the units are nearly identical.Out of the box performance as excellent, but the monitor really shined after a few image tweaks. Fyi for anyone who has this monitor, custom tune your color settings to NOT use the \"Vivid\" enhancement. The image becomes way blown out and the contrast is much too high. After toning it down to standard with \"neutral\" color setting (along with a few other tweaks in the various sliders) I was able to get a superb picture.I currently have an XBOX 360 connected to it through component at 1080i. I have also had a chance to check out a Blu-Ray movie on a PS3 I borrowed...which was absolutely jaw-dropping at 1080p. I also tested Ridge Racer 7 (PS3) which runs natively on 1080p and as far as resolution and clarity are concerned that's as good as it gets. I can't wait until future PS3 titles support native 1080p...people with capable sets are in for a treat. After getting a taste of true 1080p with HD content, it's hard for me to go back to anything else haha. I guess I spoiled myself a little to early.The OSD and menus are intuitive and very easy to use. I didn't find myself going to through uneccessary menus to get to my final destination. I especially liked the feature of being able to rename my video inputs (1 through 8) with either custom tags or with a selection from a pre-determined list (DVD, GAME, SAT, etc..).I was skeptical about the sound quality from the speakers at first, but I was pleasantly surprised by the fidelity and clarity of sound they outputted. Who knew TV speakers could sound good? I live in an apartment so  I was happy that I didn't have to add a complex surround sound setup.Shipping was safe and secure. Amazon uses Eagle Freight shipping services for this unit and they were very efficient, although tracking is updated less frequently than other carriers. Not really a downside though.", "Date": "November 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Without equal on HD yet amazingly GREAT and watchable on SD", "Author": "P. Rudy \"Adventure Traveler\"", "ReviewID": "R2GFWRGOUGXZU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most of the people reviewing, I spent my time looking around before buying.  I first saw this tv in Costco in November.  I was shocked that my wife and I both loved the picture.  It was amazing how much better it looked compared to the DLP sets and plasmas.  Living at 7500 feet, plasma was not really an option.Becuase of Costco's liberal return policy, we bought it then and there.  Its nice that the unit does NOT have to kept upright, like a glass plasma. Out of the box, you need to immediatley turn off the vivid settings. We stuck with the normal settings for 24 hours to burn the set in before calibrating.For the first 4 weeks, all we had was DISH SD sat.  I must tell you, I was shocked by the picture quality of Standard Definition sat channels on this set. No, it was not HD like, but pleasingly watchable.  VERY watchable.  I work with several electronics companies and go to CES each year. I have seen many a $4000 flat panel that was horrible in reproducing SD.  This is not one of them.  My wife made the comment that if we did not upgrade to HD, we could live the SD signal on this set.  Note that we were (at that time) outputing from the sat box to the Sony by S cable. The Dish sat box did not have component out.Playback from a SD DVD was even a notch more impressive.  We have a pro grade 480i (non progressive) dvd player and output the DVD by component to the LCD.  The Sony did a great job of upscaling the signal.  Our DVD's never looked better.  The colors were far superior on the Sony than our 35\" tube set.  Very very watchable.After 24 hours of burn in, we calibrated the set with the DVE dvd.  its a must have and cheap for the power it gives you.  Calibation only took 30 minutes.  Turns out my wife's eyes were more sensetive than mine.  Calibrating was easy and the results tremendous.  The black levels were 100% greater range.  Again, we were using SD sat for a signal.After calibration, our satisfaction with SD on the Dish Sat went up another 10%.  No, it still was not HD like, but the best SD I had EVER seen on any flat panel. I was just looking for watchable SD and this far exceeded by expectation. Calibration softens the jagged transistions that a good HD set can illuminate.So, we lived with SD for 30 days. Happily. Then I noticed that Amazon had the same set for what amounted to $800 cheaper (considering no tax).  The price difference was too much to pass up.  Ordered from Amazon and took the Costco set back.The Sony from Amazon showed up in 5 days --- broken. The driver and I took off the box and the lower left hand corner was smashed. Off went the broken set. Called Amazon. A new set was sent out within 36 hours.  Came in 6 days - perfect condition.  The Eagle freight guys are good.  They call as soon as the tv hits their local distribution facility.Two days later, Dish comes to upgrade or Sat to HD. Everything the other reviewers say is so true.  The HD picture is nothing short of spectacular. When the Dish tech is setting up, I was in another room.  He asked me a question. When I went into the room and first saw the HD picture, I dropped the cookie in my hand I was so startled.  The picture on GOOD HD content is mesmerizing.  Note that we are using the HDMI output of the SAT box directly into the SONY.We have surround sound system and all audio is run from that.  So, no comment on the Sony's internal speakers.  But, in my opinion, you would be crazy to have  LCD of this size/quality without a decent surround sound 5.1 system.In Sum:  GO BUY THIS FLAT PANEL.  I had read review after review. This Sony really does give 99-100% of the PQ performance of the XBR2 and XBR3 sets for substantially less money.My experience with SD was vastly different from the viewer below complaining of SD PQ on the Sony.  Since owning this set, I have spoken by email with several other owners. No one has had his problems.Closing Comments.  These are my thoughts, using my DISH sat signals.  I have no idea what off the air looks like. I did hook the set up briefly to Comcast SD cable and the SD was only fair -- but it was pretty fair on a CRT. Gargage in -- garbarge out.  The Sony cannot make a silk purse out of a pigs ear, but no flat panel can do that.We are most happy with our purchase and buying it from Amazon.", "Date": "December 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sony 46\" LCD vs Samsung's 46\" LCD", "Author": "N. MOY \"Buyer\"", "ReviewID": "R7J3M6AZ2T7JY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing quite of bit of research recently, physically in person as well as on-line, I ended up purchasing this Sony (KDL-46V2500) flat panel for several reasons and I am extremely happy with my decision.Having a bit of personal preference towards LCDs beforehand, I was not convinced enough overall in the end to switch over to Plasmas.Now, in comparing LCDs, the best thing I could do was to sit in front of both abovementioned LCDs in one of the movie chairs at my local retail store and luckily compare them side-by-side right next to each other. Appearing as though I was looking at a tennis match in the store, I was also able to look at the other 30+ models/brands/types surrounding them and instantly and consistently, my eyes would automatically focus on this Sony each and every time.Narrowing it down, it became apparent almost immediately, that the black shiny glossy bezel as well as the screen that Samsung unfortunately uses creates way too much glare and a wavy reflection which distracts from the picture itself. The black matte bezel and non-glare screen that Sony uses allowed my eyes to solely focus on their screen/picture. It actually made it look like I could reach out and touch the most vibrant pink flowers I have ever seen, that were being shown. Wanting to get another opinion, I brought my colleague to the same store the following day and she, too, ultimately floatated to and could not take her eyes off the Sony! She also noticed the glare/reflections on the Samsung. Being used in a conference room with fluorescent lighting and lots of sun, would not help matters.Feature-wise, the Sony meets all of our needs/requirements and then some.I also considered Sony's XBR series (2=gray bezel, 3=black bezel) which also has the extra glass/silver trim frame and even though it does have a more elegant look, I could not justify paying the higher price. If price/budget was not an issue, I would have definitely considered the XBR3.Highly recommend this Sony KDL-46V2500 and seeing it in person!", "Date": "December 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia......BRAVO!", "Author": "Harry Bulgari \"Big H\"", "ReviewID": "R22GFLNQR8CKPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After waiting just over a month to get this TV, all I can say is it was definetly worth the wait.  Part of the reason it took so long I believe is the timing of the order. I ordered it on December 15, right before the holidays, so maybe that slowed it down some, but regardless of the time it took, the TV really is amazing.I did about 3 months research by reading all the reviews on Amazon as well as other websites. By the way thanks for the first 15 or so reviews I read on here before purchasing this TV, it was a really big help in making my decision. I wanted an LCD because the plasmas have such a glare, among other issues. I had it finally narrowed down to the Sony and the Samsung LN-S4695d. I didn't like the look of the Sammy's shiny black frame, although the picture quality is right up there with the Sony. What finally made my decision was seeing the Sony at BJ's on display. It just blew me away, and my wife was also startled at the picture quality of the Sony. Also the fact that the Sony was only about $200 more than the Sammy helped the decision. By the way BJ's price is over $700 more than Amazons price if you figure in the extra $200 sales tax that you would have to pay.I have the TV hooked to Comcast Digital cable through the HDMI input. I also bought the Sony upconverting DVD player which is run through the other HDMI input on the TV. The DVD's really do look better with the upconverting player which converts the DVD's to a 1080i signal. Although the picture that really grabs me is the HD channels on the cable. I watched the playoffs of the NFL last week and was absolutely wowed at the detail. The Discovery HD channel is also amazing. I can't imagine a TV that could get even a better picture. I haven't seen this TV's picture quality with a direct 1080p signal such as the Blue-Ray disc or the HD DVD, but I can't imagine how it can be better that the high def channels in 1080i. I'm just glad that I have the 1080p technology on this TV for the future when hopefully someday soon all DVD formats and brodcast formats will be in 1080p. If anyone that bought this Sony has used it watching a Blue Ray disc, please comment.It's been over two weeks now that I received this TV and the WOW factor is kinda wearing off, but when I go into the bedroom to watch my \"old fashioned\" 480i TV, before sleeping, the picture looks super blurry and I can't imagine I watched TV like that for the past 49 years. Also I don't have the clouding issues as others talked about. So in wrapping this up, if you are looking for a top notch high def TV, I seriously think that the Sony KDL-46V2500 is the abslute best out there on the market today for the price. The experience of buying this through Amazon was also great. I would give Amazon and Eagle Freight who delivered the TV both 5 stars as well as 5 stars for the TV. Also I have to mention that purchasing this TV through another website besides Amazon......BEWARE, I 've read horror stories about other companies that may offer this TV for a hundred or two hundred dollars cheaper. The fact that Amazon backs up all their stuff for 30 days made me feel confident with dealing with them.", "Date": "February 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV But Mine Does Have Some Clouding", "Author": "Amy K.

When I went to the local store to compare models, the Bravia line always looked much better than the other makers.The design is nice and slender (I actually like the look of this model over the pricier XBR models)...the back of the TV has an easy layout for all the cables.  I like the fact that the power button is on the top of the TV so my kid can't go turning the TV on and off which was a favorite pasttime for her on my old TV.The remote control is a little bland but I really use the one that Time Warner provided to me anyway.One thing I recommend is to talk to your HDTV provider to make sure the box they will give you has HDMI cable support which you really need to get the most out of your television.My TV does have some clouding which is disappointing to me but is really not that big of a deal.  On mine, there is an unevenly lighted region in the top left corner and a few smaller areas elsewhere.  When there are scenes which have a lot of black (like when the credits are rolling at the end of a movie for example) I notice the uneven backlight clouds.  But other than that, I don't notice it at all.It did surprise me at first that such a TV would have this but it really isn't anything more than a minor nuisance.  The quality though from normal viewing is phenomenal.Regular non HD programs look so-so but that is something I can endure until HD becomes main stream.One last thing I want to state is the Eagle delivery was fantastic.  They called to let us know which day the tv was going to arrive...their delivery workers were courteous and did their job just fine.

True, standard definition programming doesn't impress, but it won't impress on any 1080p set as there's simply nowhere for those low resolution images to hide - you see them in all their ugliness.  HD programming, however, is simply breathtaking, and surfing the Internet and gaming in 1080p has to be seen to be believed.  This LCD has brightness to spare and the colors are simply incredible.  Vivid and accurate, this TV is amazing EXCEPT for what looks like gray-white clouds visible in particular during dark scenes.  My set is plagued by the clouds (the biggest cloud, about 4\"w by 8\"h, is in the bottom right) and I find them quite distracting.  These clouds are the result of the backlight \"bleeding\" through the liquid-crystal screen unevenly, and they are a common issue with this set.  So do your research - Google \"xbr clouds\" (the Sony XBR2 and XBR3 use the same LCD panel as this set) and read carefully before buying!Otherwise, there's a lot to like about this TV.  It looks much better than the picture on Amazon makes it out - the case is a charcoal gray, not battleship gray, and there is a nice silver bezel running around the entire set.  It's also relatively compact, as the speakers (which sound good) are tucked underneath the set.  The remote is simple though you'll probably want to get a universal remote if you have other equipment.  There are 2 HDMI inputs (plenty for me and if you need more, get a switch - they're cheap if you know where to look), plenty of other inputs and the menus are clear and easy to navigate.This is truly a 5 star set but for those darn clouds.  Here's hoping that Sony can somehow lift the clouds away!", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "S.

The picture quality with clarity and color is stunning. I have never been much of a movie buff, but watching them in HD on this TV changes the whole experience.  You feel like you are there.

Amazon gave free shipping, and it turned out to be WHITE GLOVE.  Which means they bring it into the house, unbox it and place it where you want it.  I made the guys wait a few minutes while i hooked it up and turned it on, once i was happy, i signed the papers and they left.  Thats a very awesome service, no box or trash left behind.  :-)The TV itself is amazing.  It does about what it should for standard def channels. The tv has a scan option to pick up digital signals which takes about 50 minutes, once you get used to the channel numbers for digital signals its really cool.  My television even picks up the digital broadcast from other peoples In-demand comcast boxes (i hate when they fast forward or pause during movies).  It picks up the normal over the air HD channels and looks great. Anytime im on a channel that theres an HD one for, ill switch from analag to digital.The remote for the TV is great, its a little big, but very easy to use and nicely laid out.  The built in speakers sound good for what they are.  My wife can actually sleep if i turn them down, and i can still hear them fine!One of the things im stoked about is the fact that its capable of 1080p.  When the price of the 1080p devices comes down a bit, thats when ill buy one and start enjoying an even better picture.Overall this is a very good television.  Amazons price will save you money over the major stores.  To repeat it, i love this tv. Theres no ghosting or bleeding or shadowing or anything that you may hear in some reviews.

I've been waiting for a 1080p TV for a long time, and this was the first one that had reasonable specifications at a good price.At this point, we are using the DirecTV HI-Def satellite and playing DVDs through the two HDMI ports, and it looks fantastic.  The resolution is superb, the scaling of the digital signals looks great, the response time is good enough for all of our viewing.  The TV looks nice on the wall and starts up quickly.When we first got the TV, though, and plugged it in to our standard-def (analog) DirecTV system and component DVD player, it was horrible.  It was so bad, I was sure there was something wrong in the setup, but no -- it's all it could be.  It wasn't just that the TV was faithfully producing the flaws in the original analog signal, it looked amazingly worse than our analog TV.  Just to be sure, we hooked up the old TV next to this Bravia, and you could see tremendous amounts more detail in the analog TV.What it appears to be doing with Analog signals is 1) attempting to blend multiple frames together to reduce noise and 2) just not upscaling the image very well.  I've seen dozens of hi-def panels, and none have had this problem.  I looked through all the menus to see if there was a way to affect the upscaling algorithms, but there weren't.Also, when looking at analog DVD signals, I couldn't get a wide-screen format that worked.  The various zoom modes that the TV provided didn't give an image that filled the screen without stretching the picture horizontally.That said, now that we are only looking at digital signals, it is completely not a problem.The only other problem I have is with the closed captioning.  The captions are beautifully rendered, but several times as big as they should be, taking up maybe 15% of the screen.I haven't hooked this up to my computer yet.  For some reason, the manual says not to hook up the computer through the HDMI connections, I am not sure why.  I occasionally see some banding in DVDs and HiDef satellite signals, but I'm not sure if it's the TV or the input -- hooking up the computer would let me generate test signals to see where the problem is.  In any case, the banding is not too objectionable.So -- if you are displaying just digital signals, I think this could be a good monitor.  If you need to show analog signals you cannot buy this box.My name is unique.", "Date": "December 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable Quality & Price - Diff between XBR Undetectable", "Author": "J.

I am running the Xbox 360, an HD-DVD player and Time Warner digital cable through it.Specifically, the Xbox 360 and HD-DVD player look understandably beautiful. There is simply nothing that I can say about these two running through this TV other than that they work perfectly together. HD-DVD definately earns its tagling of \"The Look and Sound of Perfect\" while running through the KDL-46v2500 - or at least the \"Look\" part, as any self-respecting HT buff wouldn't use anything but a high end reciever for their listening pleasure, so I am not entirely sure what these speakers sounds like ;-).Time Warner cable leaves a bit to be desired, but it has nothing to do with the TV, as much as it has to do with a crap signal. Granted their HD content looks outstanding @ 1080i, but the SD content is hit or miss based on the original source being digital or analog. Of course they claim to upconvert the analog sources to digital, but you can definately tell. That being said, the digital SD content looks surprisingly well on this TV. Nothing unexpected, but nothing particularly exciting either. The analog upconvert stuff leaves a bit to be desired, but it passes as really no worse than on my CRT HDTV.

The Sony 40 and 46V2500 series is capable of producing a hi-def picture second to none--and with little to no set-up or calibration.  Moreover, it has features--a swivel stand, non-glossy surface, Tru-Surround sound--that may place it ahead of more recent models.  If you're trying to determine what distinguishes it from the Sony 40 and 46V3000 series, the main difference is that the speakers of the V3000 series are on the sides instead of the bottom, resulting in a somewhat wider frame.  Also, the V3000 series comes with Theater-Synch, which may be a consideration to consumers who have other Sony components that they wish to incorporate with the screen while limiting the number of steps and remotes. The other differences are primarily specs not relevant to the actual viewing experience--number of bits, contrast ratios, 24 fps, etc.--the purely technical things that videophiles dwell on for the sake of argument, whether visible or not to the naked eye. Truthfully, my eyes see no room for improvement.If you're shopping in the 1000-1400 range and haven't been brainwashed by the Samsung advocates, there's no question in my mind that the biggest bang for the buck would be the 40 or 46V2500 from Amazon Warehouse.  The major caveat is the meager amount of actual hi-def content.  (Out of the 2000 channels listed in my Time-Warner materials, no more than 20 of them regularly telecast at 720p and higher. And most of that is mindless mush--though with this Sony model it can be a pleasure just to watch scenery.)If purchased from Amazon Warehouse, this is currently the only 46\" picture that can be purchased for under $1500.  Rest assured that you will get no better deal, no bigger picture for the money, and no better picture period.  (Ignore the stuff about damaged or scratched sets.

For me it came down to this Sony 2500, the Samsung LNT4661 and Samsung LNT4665.  However, I quickly eliminated the Samsung 4665 b/c screen had too much glare for me.  It really was a toss up between the Sony and the Samsung 4661, but the deciding factor was the TV sound of the Sony.  If you're going to add a subwoofer and lots of external speakers, than maybe the samsung would work for you.  However, I did not have room, ability to wire or the $$ to spend a lot on external speakers.  Therefore, I wanted a TV that delivered excellent sound and the SONY 46\" 2500 delivers superb sound.  The speakers are on the lower front portion of the screen, vs. on the side for the Samsung.  The sound projects forward and is excellent, and sounds like a small movie theater, even without additional speakers.  You will be very impressed with the sound that this TV delivers.  Side by side in the local showroom, the SONY clearly was the better sounding TV, and the picture quality was similar between the SONY/Samsung.  The picture is crisp, lifelike and very sharp.  Some of the early reviews (2006, early 2007) have mentioned clouds on this TV, but I haven't seen any.  I think its resolved with the later production dates on this TV.  Black coloring is black, HD is crisp.  Also, this TV does a good job of showing the 480i signal when HD1080i is not available (such as on PBS stations).  Many of the LCD other brands of LCD screens do a horrible job with non-HD signal, but the Sony still delivers if 1080i isn't available.  There are plenty of inputs (8 video input signals) and the TV is sleek.  I highly recommend this TV.  I purchased it for around $1549 on Amazon, no shipping, no tax... a great deal.

First, I purchased Vizio 46GLV LCD HD and it was great. However, it had some problems (constant buzzing sound) and the SD signal looked bad, so I returned it. Next, having low budget, I purchased SONY RP HDTV KDF-46E2000. The SD signal was better, however, to my shock, the HD signal was not as good as on LCD TV. I returned it as well. I was tired and finally decided to spend a a lot more to get better quality TV, hence I decided to purchase KDL-46V2500.[...]Well, I got TV delivered last month in great condition. I hooked up to cable and first thing I see is blank screen. I realized that I did not have signal coming in on that input for some reason. However, I saw patches of clouds (e.g. light bleeding through LCD screen) on lower left portion, upper right portion and middle right portion of screen. I read about cloudiness issue and XBR models (google \"xbr cloudy\"). I realized quickly what I was looking at the same and was incredibly disappointed. I also noted that same problems on dark scenes while playing some movies. btw, for details on this issue, check out AVS forum for V2500 series.Then, I hooked up my Comcast HD box. The HD signal looked fine, not better than Vizio's as I was expecting. I was again shocked. It looked great in store such as Fry's or Best Buy, but most of these guys were playing HD on their 1080p BlueRay player and that looked really great.Next, I tested SD signals (e.g. Science channel, CNBC, Comedy,etc.) and I was even more disappointed as I found the SD signal on this model even worst than Vizio's!So, overall, I am disappointed with the quality of KDL-46V2500. Believe me, I am SONY fan and all my home theater gear is from SONY, but SONY TVs just don't seem to be what they used to be (maybe, unless you spend $3000+ on their high Bravia end models).Well, I called SONY tech support (4 times by now). Every single time, I got the same reply: \" I have never heard of this problem\". During my 3rd call, I told them that SONY had finally admitted problems with XBR models and posted the notice. He said that it was only for XBR models and SONY does not know/aware of same cloudiness problem with V2500s. I said many people on web have complained, but he vaguely suggested to ignore comments from people on internet. I was really frustrated. During 4th (today) call within one week, tech rep. gave me the list of authorized repair shops and asked me to give them call. Still, he would not accept that there is a cloudiness problem on V2500 model.I am really disappointed with stubbornness of SONY tech support and SONY as company to listen to customer's problems and even to investigate/acknowledge them.Workaround to cloudiness problems:Since I am stuck with SONY HD TV ( ), I started investigating workaround. Actually, the workaround posted by SONY on their website (url listed above) works fair, but with the compromise of HD quality. To my eyes, after this setting, HD picture is not as vibrant as it was without those suggested settings. For now, I am settled with that without having other alternatives.So, overall, I am not too happy so far with the quality of V2500 model and really wish instead I'd settled for Vizio's new 1080p model (GV47LF) which was almost $1K less than what I paid for SONY.

Eagle called to set up a time, which was to be after 5pm.  The guy arrived at 4:20pm and was lucky that I was home from work at that time.  I was told by Amazon that I would receive \"white glove\" delivery where the TV would be unpacked so I could inspect it and then the box taken away. This did not happen. The guy brought it into my house and I asked to inspect it.  I opened the box only to find I could not lift the TV alone.  The driver did not offer any assistance and told me he would write \"subject to inspection\" on the invoice.  I was uncomfortable with this, but again he did not offer to unpack the TV for me.  He seemed to be in a hurry.  I expected to receive white glove delivery as promised and was very unhappy with Eagle.  This may just be in my area, as people here tend to be very lazy.  As for the TV, we just hooked up the cable and plugged it in and it was ready to go.  The picture quality is very good.  We do not have HDTV just regular cable, but the picture is still very good.
