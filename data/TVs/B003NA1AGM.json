My kids say it is better! My Grandkids say it is better! We have Directv so I can watch 3D any time of the day. There still is limited shows but I am hoping for more. I love this TV!! I bought it for the 1080p not the 3D. but the wife said get a HDTV with 3D it is the way to go. She reads Consumer Reports, so I checked all the reviews and this Panasonic was listed as top line! Something about Panasonic is the only 3D to use 1080p in both eyes? Directv also listed it as one of their advised 3D TV's to buy, it was the first on their list BTW! Now I am no techie, but my daughter told me after watching for 5 minutes that this 3D was so good I could sell seats in my house! LOL. I wish 2 sets of glasses came with the TV but hey if you can afford this set you can afford the glasses. I just hated giving them back and forth to the whole family all night. I bought my Pana here on AMAZON @ World Wide Stereo and they used CEVA to ship the TV the truckers came with the TV early (3days) and helped me get the box off too. Very nice delivery men BTW!  The whole process from order to turning this TV was 5 Star for me. This is my second Panasonic HDTV the first is a 720p in our bedroom that I have had over a year and we are very happy with. I have watched how many ESPN 3D football games? How many 3D shows? People came in on Halloween and sat down and would not leave! they just wanted to see 3D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The picture quality is the best I have ever seen, especially the THX mode. Blu-ray discs become a must.  The black levels are so good you may find yourself picking out blu-ray movies that feature dark scenes just to see how well they look.  Dark games like Fallout 3 or Arkham Asylum look simply incredible.  3d Works well, I have tested it with the Killzone 3 demo on PS3 and you feel totally immersed.  I did not see any \"ghosting\" affects.  One complaint is I wish it had a wireless capability. It requires a wired connection or you need to purchase a separate adapter for wireless.  Viera Cast stuff is good.  Netflix is included as well as YouTube, Pandora, Amazon etc.  Youtube for some reason has a pared down interface and I wasn't able to select HD resolution like I can from PC.  But they could fix this in a firmware update and it can be done from PC so no big deal.  I don't think there is any better TV you can buy at any price point, unless you are just getting a bigger size.  The new vt30's will probably best this tv but they will cost a lot more.  Recommend!Edit: 3/17/2011.  Unfortunately, the TV has burn in issues.  We were very diligent during the first 100 hours, but then we started playing games thinking it was safe.  My wife had been playing Fallout 3 the last month or so and the HUD from the game is now burned into the screen.  Unbelievable that Panasonic isn't warning customers about this possibility.  Instead, the warnings are focused on only the first 100 hours.  We play in THX mode, contrast and brightness set to 70.  I was led to believe that burn in was no longer a problem on these sets after the first 100 hours.  Unfortunately, this is NOT the case.  Lowered my rating of the set to 3 stars.  It is great picture, but susceptible to burn in.  Now our tv is apparently permanently compromised.Update: 4/8/2011  The burn in is still there after running the tv's own anti-image retention tool and also running third party tools designed to remove it for many days on end.  This TV is severely flawed and I don't recommend that anyone buy it with these kind of problems unless you plan to baby sit your tv all the time.  If you search online for vt25 burn in you will find many cases of what I'm talking about.  Don't watch anything that has a static image on the screen with this tv, and heaven forbid you forget and leave something on the screen for a couple hours -the tv could be permanently damaged if you do.Update: 4/16/2011 We played Bioshock for about 2 hours, then watched a movie.  Afterwards it took a full night to remove the image retention from Bioshock HUD using slides and the tv's own anti image retention scrolling bar feature.  The next day we played 2 hours again followed by other content.  It has taken over 2 days to remove the retained image.  Unless we have a lemon, this tv is completely unfit for gamers.  If I could I would return it and I will probably never again buy a Panasonic or any other plasma tv unless they stop excluding IR issues from their warranties.Update: 06/20/2011  The burn in is still there and does not appear to be diminishing.  We no longer play any games on the tv, only on my 23\" work monitor.  Also, standard definition content creates black sections on the sides.  We run the scrolling bar and full color slides every time after watching standard definition content.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Haven't found a complaint yet...", "Author": "J.

I had two disasterous experiences at two different Best Buys and ended up going to the local TV/video store (Video Only, if you happen to be in an area with one). They really know their stuff, and pointed me to this beauty.It's not as sleek as some of the 0.5\" thick LED's (it's about 3.5-4\"). It doesn't have built in WIFI. The internet applications leave something to be desired. But the picture quality can't be beat. Hands down, the best picture I have seen from a TV. I was skeptical of a plasma, but the quality, reliability and durability of the plasmas today outweigh the benefits of a LED tv. You can look up and compare the numbers, but the fact is that this tv \"just looks better\".One thing to note is that LED's generally offer a \"crisper\" image (at least according to the guy at the store), but their color quality diminishes greatly when viewing from an angle. But let me say I haven't had any complaints about the quality. It is sharp and looks great.The 3D capabilities of this look stellar. I played through Call of Duty: Black Ops single player campaign in 3D and was completely blown away by the quality and the effects this TV is capable of displaying.Overall, this is a great TV. My only real complaint is that it's a bit pricey. I was able to score this set with a Panasonic 3D starter kit (2 3d movies and 2 extra pairs of glasses), a 3d blu ray player and another set of glasses (in addition to the set included with the tv and the two in the starter kit) included in the price.

You don't have to be blown away by the 3D feature when the 2D looks this good.  It's so clear with near perfect color that the 2D looks almost 3D.  I ran a video test of the calibration of it and it didn't need any adjustment.  This was a first for me.  No red push. The only thing I can find fault with is only one pair of 3D glasses comes with it.  Also, if you want to hang it on an already purchased wall mount it does not come with the screws that fit the four holes in the back.

But Consider a Calibration", "Author": "A-RodgersThat", "ReviewID": "RF0LT8DBVMFPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Panasonic is the first incorporating Pioneer's KURO technology. This tech was sold to Panasonic when Pioneer decided to get out of the flat panel business after 2009. Pioneer made only plasmas but they were, and are still regarded as the best TV period! That is a fact and a depressing one for some (including me <:-/ because a Pioneer TV generally cost approximately $5,000-$8,000, give or take 1K and where it was sold - you get what you pay for is an often repeated line by those who own them or just simply viewed them. Now, Panasonic in its first year with KURO technology (they incorporated only SOME of that tech in their 2010 plasma line) made a TV that while wasn't quite in the same league as Pioneer, sure raised a few eyebrows among HDTV consumers and videophiles alike.Now to get to my point. As nice as the TC-PxxVT20/25 is out of the box, which is impressive, I would firmly, firmly suggest you have yours calibrated. You've already spent somewhere in the neighborhood of $1,800. Now have it calibrated by an ISF-certified Pro (~$300, and AVOID having it done by a big box store). After having this particular TV calibrated, your black levels will have better detail, your colors will appear spot-on accurate and have great contrast, the life of your panel will be considerably extended and many save on energy costs. The difference is startling. It's really that good. For that matter, I recommend a calibration for any display system, even valued older CRT models). Once you have this TV properly calibrated it still won't look like a Pioneer KURO but it will be much, much closer. It will look so good you will just marvel at the picture - 2D or 3D.Calibrations are recommended for plasmas after 100-150 hrs of use. This is referred to as the break-in period. In the mean time watch your TV using it's standard or theater type settings. Don't use the torch-like settings because phosphor lifespan is accelerated during the first hundred hours or so. You can have it calibrated at any time in its life after that point and it only needs to be done once.Why don't TV manufacturers ship their TVs calibrated? Simple. When people shop for a TV they go to a store and look at all different models to narrow down their selection of which to buy. Which TVs appear to be best are the ones that have bright, exaggerated colors and contrast all in an effort to get your attention. LCDs are more popular simply because they produce the brightest and most vivid colors. Especially in a brightly lit room where plasmas perform their poorest.But you don't have to listen to me, do a google or better yet go to AVS Forums.comIf you do or don't what matters most is your happiness. I'm just passing on some info that will get your set to give you the most of that.

Rather, a red LED at the bottom of the set flashes 10 times.  Apparently this sort of quality control has been a somewhat common problem with Panasonic plasmas in the past and I've noticed a couple other reviews of this model that said the same thing.Bottom line:  This TV has a beautiful picture, especially the 3D.  I found the 3D worked wonderfully, as opposed to my first attempt with the Sony Bravia 240hz LED-LCD that was plagued with double-images (ghosting).

Very impressive 3D, although the overall picture quality and black levels are inferior to my Pioneer plasma.  The next day, the new 3D TV stopped working.  A red light flashes four times on the front, indicating a hardware fault and power failure.  It's very common, from what I've discovered on-line.  I contacted Panasonic (who couldn't care less), and they wanted me to have a local repair place take the TV to their shop and try to fix it (under warranty).  I've instead decided to return the TV to Amazon, since I luckily kept the original packaging.  Now the fun of disconnecting it all, and will now repackage and eventually ship back to the seller.  After Amazon receives the TV, they will issue me a credit so that I can buy a new one.  That will take at least a couple weeks.

Butler", "ReviewID": "R28GKNOBS5PQO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to jump into 3D, mostly for 'Avatar', although I now own several other 3D titles. This TV replaced a 50\" Hitachi I've had for about 4 years.The picture quality is just amazing. It is much brighter and crisper with more detail and contrast than the TV it replaced, even though it is the same screen size and resolution. Setup/installation was very easy- it fit on my existing wall mount with no problems, and it weights about half as much as the older Hitachi. It is about 1.5\" thinner than the old Hitachi too. If you don't want to wall-mount it, it also comes with a nice swivel stand.It has all of the inputs I think anyone would want from an HDTV, including 4 HDMI inputs that are ALL 3D enabled. The styling looks great in the stand or on the wall. It has a glare filter on the screen that cuts window and glare from room lights way down. On my wall, watching movies in a dimmed room, the dark gray bezel disappears. My last TV had a silver bezel that just stood out all the time.3D performance is wonderful. What little ghosting I can find (and that's looking for it) is actually about the same as I've noticed in 3D cinemas. I looked at demos of all the major brands' 3D offerings at a retail store, and the Panny just blew them away. \"Full HD\" 3D is full 1080P 3D. Many others reduce the 3D resolution because they can't drive enough pixels fast enough. This is especially true with the LCDs. Plasma is just MADE for content like this, and I feel LCDs will always be playing catch-up. One of my favorite things to do when I have friends over is hit Pause in a really good 3D scene. You can walk right up to the TV and the scene seems to move with you- it looks like a hologram. The \"wow\" factor (elements seem to jump off the screen) is also superb. A good movie for this is actually 'Despicable Me'.It has a THX certified mode, and uses RealD 3D technology (although not the same passive RealD used in cinemas. It also has VieraCast (Internet-enabled TV) if you have an available wired network connection.I only have two issues, and I didn't feel they were worth dropping the star rating for:Like all plasma sets- this one has a noticeable buzzing noise. I've either gotten so used to it that it doesn't bother me anymore, or it has slowly gone away as the TV breaks-in. I don't notice it now unless I put my ear right up to it.The set I bought came with 1 set of 3D glasses. I also bought the Avatar 3D combo-pack which came with two more. They are two different styles (1st and 2nd generation), and I find both of them very uncomfortable. My friends don't think they are at-all, so it is probably just me. I'm experimenting with some universal glasses and the Panny glasses actually come in different sizes too- so I may also try that.All-in-all: I love this TV and recommend it to everyone.A few bits of 3D advice if you are just looking into this:If you are buying this for 3D- you need to buy a \"High Speed\" rated HDMI cable. This is the ONLY rating you need to look for. You have to use a high speed cable because a standard cable can't transfer data fast enough for Full-HD 3D.While it is a good idea to buy the same brand if you want to take advantage of remote control features (VierraLink), you do not HAVE to buy the same brand BD player as the TV. Any 3D BD player will work with this TV. I'd make sure it is 3D \"out of the box\" and it doesn't just say \"3D Capable\".If you have a HT receiver- make sure it does \"3D Passthrough\" (check with manufacturer) and be sure to use high speed HDMI cables to and from the receiver. If you don't- just run a high speed HDMI cable from your BD player to the TV, and run an optical cable from BD to receiver.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with this TV", "Author": "David R.

The picture quality for HD material is probably the best I've seen. There is great depth and dimensionality to HD viewing - likely from the excellent black levels and detail. I found the THX setting to work well for both TV and Blu Ray viewing.I was just a little disappointed with the sound quality. It's not bad, I just expected it to be a little more powerful and have better surround sound effects - as this is their flagship model. (I'm using this in my bedroom so I was hoping I would not need any additional surround gear.) The remote for this TV works fine, but it's pretty vanilla for a flagship model. To be clear - there are no faults here, I just had higher expectations.I've tested the 3D functions (purchased the Avatar movie/glasses kit and Blu Ray with the unit) and I agree with other folks that 3D on this TV is better than at the movie theater.

And that's what it is, a marvel.  Side kudos to Directv for having the foresight to feature three 3D channels on their menu (at no additional charge beyond the HD tier) with more to follow, I'm told.  It took me awhile to configure the TV correctly and found myself reading the (dread) manual that came with the TV and the glasses in order to get the picture where I wanted it.I had some experience with Panasonic, having bought a plasma 42\" HDTV some six months ago so the lessons learned on that initial setup stood me in good stead on this hatching.  I learned the glasses have a power on button along the frame which power down when the glasses have been removed from one's head for a time.  It's a simple hold for one second, red light engages, and you're ready to view in 3D which is nothing short of spectacular!Who would've thought this kind of innovation/technology would be available in the home and, relatively speaking, so soon?  Certainly not I.  The Panasonic brand of TV has been endorsed for 3D viewing by Directv and for good reason.  The brand with its plasma display is simply the best I've seen.  Again, caution is required by the first time owner to correctly adjust and set the various set-up arrays but once done, it literally rocks the house.The instructions in the accompanying manual are well laid out and written so even a non-techie as myself can figure out the deal and if I can, you can.  Some bricks and mortar sellers will attempt to sell you a complete set-up package for $100 or more in addition to the delivery but I would urge you to resist and set it up yourself.  Mine is mated to the Directv system so I can only speak to that connection but surely a cable array couldn't be much more difficult to solve?I've read and heard some complaints about having to wear the glasses to see the 3D but they're quite comfortable and are adjustable with additional pieces to sculpt to your nose.  The literature suggests that regular eyeglasses can be worn under the 3D frames, by the way.  Whether or not a 3D TV is in the offing that doesn't require special glasses for viewing is another matter but the 3D glasses are, in no way, cumbersome or annoying to wear and use, at least from my point of view.3D is here in all its glory and I think, here to stay with increased programming and more exciting enhancements just over the horizon so my advice is to jump in.  The water's more than fine.UPDATE (2 months later):  Growing impatient waiting for more 3D programming to emerge but it's been almost non-existent.  I'm told that the major premium channels (HBO, Showtime et al) may be jumping into the fray soon but no official statements known at this time.  I suppose in time that others will be coming to the dance the way HD caught the mainstream express a few years ago after a faltering start.  Still, it's a little disconcerting as is the growing chorus of naysayers who claim 3D is a flash in the pan, won't last, and go the way of 1950s 3D movies.I'd still get the TV in spite of these reports.  I got to watch the NCAA championship game in 3D and a few other events but no movies (that I cared to view) at this time.  The TV itself is the best HD picture in my home, by far and I have a total of 4 TVs, all with HD capability so there's that.

Although those will be priced higher, quite a bit higher, so.. you'd have to consider the cost benefit analysis.  I absolutely love the picture quality and price for this TV, as the picture quality is excellent!  There is a slight buzz that comes from the tv, but as far as I have read on forums, plasmas do have a slight buzz/hiss (frequency). It really doesn't bother me too much as I just wanted the TV with the best picture and this set besides the Samsung Plasma were a close #1 and #2, but I guess I went with what David Katz on cnet chose as the best tv of 2010.The minor flaw for me is that the Viera cast/connect (forgot the exact name) wasn't great to use and the design of the set isn't quite up to some of the Samsung sets and the set is a bit on the heavy side, but like I have repeatedly stated \"Picture Quality\" won out for me.The major flaw that happened to me was that the TV broke down after thirty five days after my Amazon 30 return policy was up.  I also had the 10 led flashes where it signals that a certain board got fried and needed a replacement.  Panasonic customer service was quite helpful and scheduled an appointment and had a tech sent out within a few days.  The tech came and told me that I needed to update the firmware and once the firmware was updated I wouldn't have this problem.  He informed me that i would have known this if I had registered the tv.  Apparently, I got one of the first produced models of the vt25 as notated by my \"early serial number\" as retailers tend to purchase in bulk and mine was probably in storage for a while.  The tech ordered the part, but the part is on backorder so I'd have to wait a week or so until it gets in to reschedule.So I'm currently in limbo waiting on my repair.

The TV is 3D ready, has THX certifications, is Skype enabled (camera sold seperately), and contains Panasonic's new NEO PDP (plasma display panel). How do all of these new features and the accompanying picture quality add up?PICTURE QUALITY RATING 91.5/100Calibration Notes: The VT25 was difficult to calibrate and get balanced and obtain a pure D6500K color measurement. This plasma TV calibrated more accurately with the Panel light at the medium setting. However, the medium setting reduced the measured contrast ration to below 1700:1 so we felt it necessary to go through an extensive calibration with the panel light on high.Panansonic VT25 Series Post-Calibration Picture SettingsPicture Mode:  CustomContrast  +85Brightness  +72Color  +48Tint  0Sharpness  0Color Temp  WARM2Processor Testing: For a top tier TV we expected a better processing chip set. There was significant background motion artifacts and noise as well as significant judder jerky effects with objects moving side to side. Though the VT25 scored well in a few categories, we were disappointed overall by what we saw. The artifacts and background noise also came through in the picture as noted below.Picture Quality and Performance: With both HD sources and standard definition content the VT25 produced a very vibrant, colorful, vivid image even after being toned down during our calibration. This TV is like a difficult to control race horse, that doesn't know when and where to focus its energy. The panel light on the VT25 is extremely powerful. The plasma 3D TV has a tendency toward over saturation with tons of light flowing through color information - providing a bright picture. Motion artifacts and background noise are present, more with standard definition programming than with HD.With a standard definition picture we were impressed with how vivid colors were displayed. Darker scenes show up very well due to the exceeding brightness of the light throughput. However, there were visible motion artifacts, flicker and judder effects with much programming and we were not impressed by the processing quality.If you love ramped up oversaturated color reminiscent of movies like The Fifth Element, 300, Kill Bill, Fox Sports Football in your TV picture even sacrificing accuracy and realism, then the VT25 may be the TV for you. Or if you have a large standard definition DVD collection and want to bring some pop to the old movies (and you don't mind extraneous motion artifacts), the VT25 may also be for you.3D TV Viewing: It took us about 20 minutes to get used to wearing the 3D glasses. For one reviewer that wears prescription glasses it took longer and was never really comfortable. In the negative category, we experienced flashing from the glasses when there was room or ambient light present. This was apparently caused by the ambient light interfering with the infrared receiver on the glasses. Turning your head away from the TV can also cuase the glasses to shut off and turn back on again when you look back to the TV. Without other light sources in the room we didn't experience the issue. I enjoyed the experience and the movie (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). The big question: Did the 3D movie, TV, and glasses enhance the experience? For me the answer is yes, it did, I felt that it enveloped me in the movie more. 3D TV is all about making the viewer feel more involved in the content and I would agree that it succeeded in that.FEATURES RATING 89.5/100Features: The Viera Cast feature enables Internet options which are a bit limited at the moment to Pandora, Bloomberg, Amazon Video on Demand, Skype, and Picasa. Fox Sports and twitter are supposedly coming soon. Notably, there is no Netflix feature. Skype is a highlight. When we hooked up the Internet options there had already been a software update, so it's good that Panasonic is actively supporting the Internet options feature.There is an important new aspect ratio feature on the VT25 located in the Picture Options section of the menu called HD Size. Setting 1 scans and displays 95% of the input image. Setting 2does the same for 100%. Set to HD size 1 if noise is generated on the edges of the screen.Aesthetic Considerations: Panasonic doesn't appear to have entered the contest when it comes to 2010's TV aesthetics. They answered, \"not present,\" even with their top end entries. The VT25's looks hearken back to yesteryear. The bezel framing is black gloss plastic at 2\" on top and 2.25\" on the sides giving the TV a large frame with no real design quality.

I have had this TV for a month and have been quite happy with the TV picture quality.2. For 3D Viewing, I sometimes sit a little closer than normal as I feel the 50'' is slightly smaller size.  And I like the 3D feel/motion of the TV.3. The PC input, both through VGI cable and HDMI are pretty good... I was pleasantly surprised how good the PC's 1024*768 resolution (I guess that's the max the TV supports) translated to a 50inch screen.4. The on-screen menus for adjustments seem to be straight forward.Cons:1. I have this TV connected to home LAN (not wireless).  The quality of youtube in the built in app is not  great (unless the youtube video is of real high quality).  However the same video when played on a PC with the PC connected through VGA/HDMI looks much better.  I am considering a laptop connected next to the TV all the time through HDMI and use a wireless keyboard/mouse.  a.  [note that only Panasonic's wireless dongle works with Panasonic's products or so was I told and should cost somewhere around $70 - did not want to spend that, so moved my router closer to the TV.  Samsung TVs also need wireless dongle or wired connection.  Most LG TVs come with built-in wireless].2. The effect of 3D is only up until 12 feet or so... once you move past 12 feet from the TV, the 3D effect is lost and you have to move a little closer (~10ft or so) to the TV to re-establish the active shutter of the eyewear.3. Hoped (however did not expect) that the TV would recognize iPhone and play songs/photos from the phone, but does not... Once connected, it only charges the phone.  Not sure if other brands recognize iPhone. Maybe, Android based phones are recognized (did not try one).4. VT- series do not have 2D to 3D conversion of the 2D content (Samsung TVs have and also GT-series have).  Not a biggie, but only helps to show off your TV to friends without needing to pop-in a 3D (avatar) DVD into the player and waiting for that.  When this 2D to 3D conversions happens in the TV, I noticed in the store that the depth of field is noticed only for limited content, like on screen text, etc.5. I hoped that the start-up time of the TV is a little faster... takes about 15seconds or more to start & recognize the cable HDMI program. [don't know about other brands/models start up time]... certainly more than what I expected.6. When using a external memory stick/hard-drive over the USB connection, it looks like it only recognizes specific video formats like mpeg2, AVCHD, but not standard formats like avi, divx, mp4, etc.  However, it recognizes the generic photo formats like .jpeg, .bmp and music files (mp3).  There are ways to convert your files to mpeg2 format and then some steps to make it work for panasonic TVs [[...]].  Samsung TVs, on the other hand, work with most common formats out of the box.  I could ignore this downside because of the bundle this TV came with... the Panasonic bluRay player the TV came with (BDT100), recognizes the generic video formats and plays them through the player's USB connection.Overall, I am quite happy with the TV and the price that I paid for it ($1650 for TV: P50VT25, 3D Bundle: which included BDT100 BluRay player, 2 USB chargeable eyewear and Avatar 3D disc... got it at VideoOnly store in Portland, OR area).", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible reliability", "Author": "motownbill", "ReviewID": "R2NUUPEMS2GWCN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a TCP50 VT25 tv.

It turns out it means made in Mexico for the Latin American market.  The instruction manual is in English and Spanish but the warranty info is only in Spanish and all the authorized service centers are in Mexico; I'm in South Florida.Concerns:  Are there functional differences between the X and non-X models?  What is the warranty and will it be honored in the US?  I e-mailed Panasonic with my questions.  Response - not qualified to answer questions must contact Corporate about this model.  Ominous sign.  Called Panasonic Concierge - very helpful.  No functional differences.  They gave me the name and number of the closest authorized service center.  I feel better but still less that satisfied.  Panasonic web site will not accept the X model number.Enjoyed the TV for a month and then the power supply died.  Contacted the service center given to me by Concierge, Jupiter Electronics in Jupiter, FL, very helpful and responsive folks.  They walked me through a diagnostic procedure to determine what's broken (10 blinks of the red light).  They came the next day as promised,  replaced the defective part in less than an hour and the TV is working again.  That's customer service!My issues lie with Amazon and Panasonic.  Amazon should insure that the merchants they use will deliver exactly what's shown on the Amazon web site.  This merchant, Audio Video Communication Store, located in Miami, FL did not deliver the model shown on the web.

The first was a 42 inch monitor (before plasma TVs were available, fed signal from VHS), the second a 42 inch high def TV I purchased about 4-5 years ago.  Both had great pictures given the technologies available at the time they were bought, and I have never had any problem with either. Pretty good reasons to buy a Panasonic again.  I bought this TV because I wanted a bigger screen and was impressed with professional reviews (as well as Amazon customer reviews) of this TV suggesting it was likely the best flat screen televison on the market (even before one considered 3d). Moreover, the price (with combined blu ray player and 3d package--2 extra pairs of glasses and Avatar disc) had fallen to what I felt was a great deal!  I have never seen a better picture!  Several of the reviews I read suggested the best thing to do is just set it to the THX setting.  They were correct.  I played some with other adjustments suggested in different reviews, but found the THX was really to my liking.  It is a little dark for some things, but you can adjust brightness if you want to tweak this. I stream alot of movies from netflicks (use blu ray player to stream), and play DVDs.  Truthfully, some of the the DVDs look so good, it is hard for me to imagine that a blu ray disc could be better.  What about 3d?  The only 3d source I have right now is AVATAR.  I have seen AVATAR in 3d in the movies so have a comparison point. I think that 3d on this TV is better than in the movie theater!  This said, even with what I think is an excellent 3d picture (consumer reports and many of the professional magazine and internet reviews agree), but on the other hand I am not that impressed with 3d.  My guess is that it will be fun to watch on some specific movies that make good use of the format, but not for much else.  I've seen (in the store) some football in 3d, but wasn't really that impressed. I'll have to wait for Verizon (or netflicks) to provide some more to watch.A final point, I had a great experience buying this TV from Amazon.

I compared this to the top of the line Samsung side by side in a specialty store, and the difference in quality, though not much, was perceptible to my average joe eyes in fast moving scenes. If picture quality is your key consideration, then you will have no regrets with the Panasonic. Also, I purchased this primarily for 2d viewing - this tv has the best 2d picture out there.Setup was  a breeze - no complaints there either.Now for the minor quibbles:I wasn't happy with the 4 preset picture settings - the THX was a bit too `dim' for regular TV viewing (it's fine when watching blu-ray stuff), and the vivid was, well, too vivid. I had to mess around and find a sweet spot between these 2, and create my own custom setting.The TV isn't to great with detecting the source format size - if you `zoomed' in to watch a 4:3 aspect DVD on the full screen, and switch to cable HD, the picture stays zoomed.  My 8 year old Sony was able to figure this out, so why can't this top of the line plasma?The plain Jane design sucks - for a top of the line plasma TV, one would have expected a bit more classier design, than  plastic black/brown strips on 4 sides. (the Samsung beats the Panasonic hands down in this category)There are USB ports on the sides, conveniently located to charge the 3D glasses (good idea!). However, they do not charge when the TV is on standby mode.  You would assume the circuitry could have been deigned to power the usb ports, even when the main TV is off ?The `free' 3d glasses provided with the TV suck - they don't fit either of my 2 young daughters, and let a lot of ambient light in from the sides, which not only distracts, but also reflects off the glasses into your eyes. (a further distraction).  To be fair, the TV has nothing to do with this issue!)The user interface for youtube and Netflix is passable, but a bit of pain to use and search through.(I queue up my Netflix online movies using my laptop,  and then navigate using the on-screen app.).Lastly, a comment about all 3d tvs - while a 50 inch size is `large', by any standards, it looks small when watching 3D, I suppose this is because objects look further away in 3d.

Mera", "ReviewID": "RR1IGQNH3U9TR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this sight unseen based on recommendations as the top LED-LCD TV and after a few months of researching both on the net and in stores. I have previous experience with LCD TVs owning about 3 Sony, Samsung HDTV and Sharp Aquous HDTV televisions over the years. I was a die hard Sharp fan. This is my first Panasonic TV purchase. I never view 3D movies. Wanted the best LCD TV for under $2500 since I plan to keep it 3-5 years. This unit lives up to the ratings.PROs:- Great TV!! -- I'm extremely happy with this purchase. My older Sharp Aquous had the darkest black pigments until I saw the Panasonic. The blacks a really inky black! No better way to describe it. They are almost too black for my comfort. So, made the blacks a little paler to bring up details in dark areas of movies/TV shows. This TV blows others out the park!- Quantity of Adjustments -- The amount of adjustable menus are a blessing and a curse. Many adjustments to fine tune the audio/video to one's liking. But, so much that it can be a little overwhelming if you are not patient or want a quick fix of a feature. I took the time over 3 days to tweak the video until I was extremely happy with the adjustment. Too much yellow in the factory settings for my taste. And a little too dark.- Customizable settings -- I customized and stored my settings. My son likes the original settings for ESPN game viewing. I can reset to my settings as needed.- Lots of Ports -- Plenty of ports to connect many devices. Some ports conveniently located on the side of the TV including a USB connection for viewing pictures on the TV.CONs:- Can't run standalone movies stored on portable hard drives using the USB port on the side of the TV. This TV will only show pictures/video on an SD card using the USB port. The workaround is to use a PC to run movies and connect through another port such as an HDMI port.- A little wobbly -- Not many things I disliked about the TV expect the slight wobble of the set in its stand. The stand is oval and has a small foot print. Looks very sleek at a distance, but, not the most stable base I have seen on HDTVs. There is a slight bobble head-like wobble of the TV. The side-to-side wobble is small and is not caused by any movement/noise unless you touch the TV to add/remove a cable. Some TVs have a wide base up to 1/3 the width of the TV. This one is about 1/8 the width of the 50\" screen. Not a problem if the TV is hung on a wall.- Glare -- Glare can be annoying in a well lit room due to polished screen. I can live with it. I would rather look at sharper pictures on a polished screen than to see dull pictures on a buffed, non-glare TV. Most of my viewing is at night when glare has no impact on picture quality.
