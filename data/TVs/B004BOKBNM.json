{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK value, but not a stellar performer", "Author": "Bowser B \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "R3FRXLKOYC4VC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this as an inexpensive kitchen TV to fit into a corner spot on the counter, and I wanted the biggest that would fit that space, so it could be seen from anywhere in the kitchen.  In that respect it is fine.  The price was very good for a 24\" TV.  It fits the corner with space for my AT&T; U-verse set top box and Roku box behind it with the two sides of the set almost touching the walls.  The TV is very thin and light.  I could see it would be easily held up by a wall bracket made for smaller sets, and in fact I'll probably try that.Setup is easy, although partly because there are not as many controls as some other sets.  This TV has two HDMI ports, which are enough for the U-verse and Roku boxes.  The user guide printed in black on flimsy paper is primitive by modern standards--not a slick color manual like you get with Vizio.  However, the information you need is there, and that's what really counts.  I've not tried the TV as a computer monitor, but it does have a VGA connection.Sound is better than I have come to expect from modern flat panel TV sets.  In fact, it is pretty good.  In contrast, my 19\" Vizio has almost unbearably tinny, thin sound.  I would give this Sansui a 5-star rating for sound, relative to other LCDs.Picture quality is a different matter.  It is clearly inferior to my 19\" Vizio, 32\" Sony, and 55\" Vizio TVs.  I have tinkered and tinkered with settings with only limited success in improving the picture.  Lost detail, especially in bright areas, is a problem.  I cannot find that magic balance of brightness, contrast, and backlighting.  Aliasing is very obvious also.  All in all, not an impressive picture.  If there is someone who has found settings that improve this, I would very much appreciate hearing about it.  For now, though, it's just a big TV that fits into a small space.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "A good bet if you can get it at a good price!", "Author": "the TiGor", "ReviewID": "R300MZVNTK5QO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was able to pick up a Sansui SLED2480 for the same price I would have paid to buy a mid-range 19\" TV, which was $198.I don't really watch television, so this gets used mostly as an external monitor for my laptop and also to watch movies on, either DVD's from my Gateway NV79  or VHS videocassettes from my Sharp VC-H993 VCR. Any 'television' I watch is streaming online content.Given the source quality, the picture is, in my mind, surprisingly good. VHS really startled me. Depending on the videocassette, the picture quality can almost rival that of a DVD when viewed on the screen of the SLED2480.The sound quality is very good. However, connecting a home theater system to it makes your experience even better!I do find the stability of this set to be somewhat questionable. If you live in a quiet house where dust is allowed to accumulate in peace, you will not likely have any problems. However, it would be a very good idea to securely anchor this set high up on a wall if small children frequent your domicile. No, it doesn't weigh much, but getting pulled over and hitting the floor probably won't do it any good, and that'll be all too easy. The base is plastic and is secured with three Phillips head screws, and I can see it breaking very easily if force is applied beyond its seemingly low strength limitations. There are brass escutcheons on the back of the set tapped for screws for a wall mount. No idea without measuring what diameter and pitch those threads are, but they're in a square pattern about 4\" apart from one another, so hopefully that's the standard pattern for TV wall mounts. Some homework may be in order if one wishes to use such a devise.The SLED2480 is a Energy Star rated product and the energy guide suggests that at five hours of use per day, the set will consume approximately $5 of electricity annually.As you generally will always get what you pay for, the Sansui is a mid-range set and you're going to get a perfectly servicable HDTV out of your money. You'll definitely be able to do much better by spending much more, but you could certainly spend a little less and do a whole lot worse, too!", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture and Sound with Many inputs", "Author": "Battle Cry Creek \"BrCrCr\"", "ReviewID": "R1HFWT8VT8G6PC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this unit on sale and I even think it was an open box, which I didn't notice at the time of purchase.  For that reason, I figured I would run the heck out of it to see if any problems developed, but the unit has been just great.  I was surprised because it more inputs than I expected and the sound was really great.  But most of all the picture is awesome!

This TV if set up with an HD TV service and 1080p DVD player is amazing picture quality. I was confused on the other review saying it had horrible picture contrast with brightness. If you read the manual and tinker  for a minute with it you should be fine. It is sturdy and I do not regret this buy.Pros:Great Picture QualityCompatible with my old (but amazing) stereo system.Sound is really good compared to most TV'sSturdyEasy to use and set-up.Saves EnergyCons:The shiny surfaces you see in the pictures on the page looks legit until you touch them. That stuff scratches so easy it is disappointing.

I was wrong, first i had to mess around with nvidia control panel to get my computer to properly display the 1920x1080 resolution. On windows 7 using an hdmi cable the text looks fuzzy and the colors are not accurate, to be honest it looks bad unless you stand from 5ft away which i cant do because i cant comfortably reach my mouse and keyboard. The weird thing is that video games and videos look great from far or close, and videos completely fill my screen now instead of having black bars on top.If your planning to get this as a monitor don't get it get a actual computer monitor which is made for look at it at close distances.If you want this as a TV and don't want to pay a lot for a TV get it, its a great tv  and looks great when watching video online and playing video games on pc.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the money", "Author": "Blahblah", "ReviewID": "R2SBONZAW6TW6I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted an inexpensive, small television for a home gym.  This TV is perfect for that purpose.  Given the price tag, you have to know it's not going to knock your socks off.  That said, it was easy to mount, has pretty good internal speakers (loud enough to hear over a treadmill motor), and a good picture. I don't have this attached to an HD source, so I can't attest to how good that might look.  If you are looking for a small TV for a small room, this is a good option.

We all seem to have some trouble tweeking for the best picture and we're no different in that regard but really the picture is very good even though it seems sort of bright in any combo of settings.
