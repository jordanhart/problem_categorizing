The screen on the HP is much better.  It also has QAM which if you live in the Bay Area and receive Comcast, you can pick up all the HD channels without the Comcast box.  Overall, excellent TV with only one downside, the channels takes about 2 secs to change.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice picture, solidly built, can't ask for more in this price range", "Author": "shinerburke \"shinerburke\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZNU9ZX2NJ3T1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for the bedroom, couldn't be happier.Pros:Has a 1200:1 contrast ratio, which is higher than most TVs in this price range. Normally to get a ratio like that you have to spend around $1500.Nice sharp picture.No ghosting to speak of, at least not that I've seen. Put it through the test with Saving Private Ryan, The Fifth Element and the pod race scence from Star Wars Episode I.Sound is surprsingly good coming from the built in speakers.Cons:Picture does take some tinkering if you want to get the best out of it. Not a big deal, but something to be aware of.The connectors are on the back of the TV, wish they were on the bottom.", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Picture for the Money", "Author": "Michael A Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1SEEICLII9FL4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had this set for 2 years before I upgraded to a larger set. I never had any problems with it like I did with Westinghouse. The picture is very good and sharp, and the sound is better than my new Samsung. It's 720p, but, perfectly fine for a bedroom or spare room. Heck, it was my main TV in my studio apt!", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "4 months old & having Screen Issues", "Author": "rhl \"rtleeland\"", "ReviewID": "R942P5W2XU900", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We've only had this tv for 4 months & all of a sudden half of the screen went white & other half went almost completely black.
