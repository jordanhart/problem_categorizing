{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good all-around", "Author": "Andrew Pleasants", "ReviewID": "RDVRDOIZ24KIQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV as a do-it-all device. I wanted to get a FP LCD monitor for my computer, and I was looking into panels that had multiple inputs. I wanted to be able to use it to play games and watch DVDs as well be able to use it for my computer. I figured while I was at it I might as well equip myself with something that can handle HD signals and I can watch tv on as well. The following is my take on its performance in said areas:PC:As a computer monitor it works very well. I am EXTREMELY picky about this type of thing and I wouldn't say it was good if it wasn't. I use it primarily as a PC monitor and I would rate it's pc performance a 4 out of 5. To get the best picture you need a decent video card and a decent VGA  cable(read: WUXGA or UXGA and some cases SXGA because of the high resolution of the panel). DVI->HDMI does not display well, you can use it in a pinch, but it will not look right, the tv was not designed to use this as a pc input. VGA works just fine, but you have to be sure you enable your resolution to match the native resolution of the monitor (the same is true with ANY LCD FP if you want the best picture quality). The native resolution of the panel is 1366x768... you can enable 1360x768 and it will chop 3 pixels (you dont lose any visual data, it just doesn't use these pixels) off of each side. Look for a program called \"powerstrip\" if you can't get your desktop to accept that resolution by default. If you choose not to use a widescreen desktop, then set the monitor picture size to 4:3 instead of Wide and use a desktop resolution of 1024x768 (the height of 768 ensures that you are still using native pixels). If you have trouble getting games to run at 1360x768 this is also a good option (set the game res to 1024x768 and change the picture size on the monitor).The picture quality is crisp and clear. There can be some very minor \"ghosting\" effects around certain colors/texts which can be aggrevated by a poor quality VGA cable. For the most part you will not notice this unless you sit extremely close to the panel or you display odd color combinations (i.e. fine bright blue text on a black background blurrs a little bit). As I said, I am extremely picky about this type of thing and if it was bothersome enough to return the monitor, I would. As with most LCDs it favors red a little bit and sometimes there can be a bit of boldness/bleeding on strong red in tight spaces (like a bright red bolded font).As far as pc games go it performs beautifully. Games are crisp, vibrant and clear. Best of all there is no response time \"ghosting\". This is something I was very concerned about because I play a lot of CS, BF2, etc. This monitor responds just as quickly as my CRT. I noticed absolutely no ghosting.Note: Most games today have command line options to set their resolution to special/custom sizes. The widescreen res you are looking for is 1360x768. Some games (like CS1.6) do not specifically support 1360x768 but do have wide aspect resolutions that still work well, but there is slight interpolation using non-native resolutions that will cause things to look a little different (still very very playable). And if all else fails you can always use 1024x768 and set the monitor to 4:3.Games:When not using it as a pc monitor I use it mostly to play PS2 and Xbox. I purchased component cables for both (which I would highly recommend) so I will comment on that.Both systems are very crisp and very clear. There is NO ghosting whatsoever and I read that others had problems with delay in response and lag between input and action on-screen. I have noticed no such thing. Again, I am extremely discerning about this type of thing and if that were the case, I would have returned it. Perhaps they had faulty panels or were using odd input sources. As far as component goes, they play VERY well. Again I would rate this 4 out of 5 because I have noticed a strange problem with PS2 displays. In certain PS2 games when there is very fine detail or there is some type of filter/mask/blur effect in the game, the panel seems to display it incorrectly. Its really hard to give an example, but its like if there is a blur effect on a shiny object, instead of the blur being uniform and fading, it has something of a checkerboard pattern. It is akin to trying to reproduce 32-bit color in 24 or 16-bit mode on a computer... it takes the two closest colors and checkerboards them together so that it seems like its one solid color. I have only noticed this in a handful of games, and even in those games it is usually restricted to whatever the softening/blurring effect is on. If you want a good example, pop in Final Fantasy Tactics for PS1. The game seems to have a full screen blur on it, I suppose to soften the sprites and make it more fluid. However, when using component cables (I have tried 2 different cables) the screen just seems to have a checkerboarded pattern instead of a fluid/smooth fading/softening to it. A minor gripe (except for in FFT since it takes up the whole screen) but a gripe none the less. I dont know if its the panel itself, the way the PS2 outputs to component, or perhaps just my panel. But I can say that I dont notice it on Xbox or on the pc. The only other game on my desk that I can think of that displays the problem is Mega Man X8 (which looks sweet in progressive mode, just hold down X and triangle as the game boots). Around some parts of the characters (easily seen on Zero's sigma blade) there is a shine/blur effect and it does the same thing.TV:I dont have HDTV or digital cable for that matter, so the standard signal is decent at best. Very watchable, but it performs like all LCDs do when using a non-digital/HD signal. No gripes.DVD:Crisp, clear and vibrant. I don't have component cables for my dvd player so I havent watched any in progressive scan yet, but via PC and PS2 (SCPH30001, no progressive) it looks fantastic (I think I actually prefer the PS2). I can only imagine it with a pro-scan set top.Bottom line:As long as your panel is in working condition and you have the right equipment for it, it makes a dynamite PC and videogame monitor. Thats the whole reason I bought it so I can assure you that I am very critical about those features. I don't know why other reviews are stating it doesn't perform in those areas when it does. Don't be shy of this model if you want to use it for a PC, games, dvd or a TV. It shines in all categories, its not extremely expensive and its about the perfect size as an all-in one without being too big a monitor or too small a TV.

The best part of this TV by far is the picture quality.  It's gives a nice crisp picture on any channel and handles fast motion with ease.

The \"W\" model is a bit older, and I'm not certain of its current manufacturing status, but there is an enormous difference between the two when using them with a PC.If you intend to use the monitor for a PC, be sure to only get the \"W\" model, not the \"WA\".  Pay attention to the labeling from the manufacturer on the box (and not the retailer's labels).  The \"WA\" and \"W\" clearly have different labels and they are indicated as such on the boxes.  Don't take the retailer's word for what they are selling either, because most sales people at the stores have no idea there is a difference.I first bought what I thought was a an LN-R238W (which turned out really to be the \"WA\" model instead) from a local Best Buy.Upon unpacking it and setting it up, I was very pleased with picture quality with both my HDTV set top box (Adelphia Los Angeles with a Moxie DVR).  The quality using the component inputs was outstanding for all the HDTV channels, and the quality was also excellent using a Samsung DVD player with the HDMI input (both the DVD player and the LN-R238W and WA have HDMI input).I encountered a problem however, when trying to use the VGA input from my computer. The native resolution for PC on the WA is 1280 x 728, which produced barely passable results with blurring of text and color pushing and bleeding around the edges.  Also the gamma and brightness were unacceptable as well.I was curious about why the PC monitor wasn't working as I had anticipated, but then I noticed that manual indicated there were two versions of the 23\" Samsung, i.e., the \"W\" and the \"WA\".  I had always assumed that there was only one model, and that I had purchased the \"W\" because that's how Best Buy was advertising it.The manual indicated that the resolution for the PC monitor with the \"W\" was 1360 x 768, which obviously is a slightly bigger bit of screen real estate than the resolution for the WA.  Not a lot, but different.  In fact, upon reading the manual a bit more carefully, it appeared that the only real true PC resolution for the WA model was 1024 x 768, which was way smaller than the \"W\" model's resolution.I tried the 1024 x 768 on the WA, and it was passable, but just barely and didn't display enough of the screen to be truly useful for me. Also, the text was still too blurry to be satisfying, and I was unable to correct the blurring and bleeding enough to satisfy me.  I also tried various other resolutions with the WA set, and could actually get it to go to 1360 x 768 using the NVIDIA drivers, but I just couldn't get the text to display acceptably without blurring and color bleeding.I then started to read the reviews here, at CNet, at Circuit City's site, at AVSForums.com, and anywhere else I could find reviews, and discovered that others had the same problem, and that there was really a difference between the \"W\" model (which I didn't have but wanted) and the WA model which I had been supplied with by Best Buy (even though they were passing it off as the \"W\").So, I decided I wanted to see if there really was a difference between the WA and the W models in real life.  I knew that Best Buy wasn't to be trusted, so I thought of other stores I could check to see if they had a true \"W\" model I could buy.  I figured if the W was really better, I'd keep it and return the WA to Best Buy (which has a 30-day return policy for TV's with no restocking charge).  So, I called a local Circuit City and verified they had a true \"W\" in stock (not \"WA\") and bought it, hooked it up and immediately noticed a stunning difference.Don't let anyone tell you that there is no difference between the W and the WA when it comes to using the set as a PC Monitor, because there is, and it's huge.The W is simply stunning, with bright, clear text, correct color and gamma, and that was without doing any calibration or adjustment, right out of the box.It is likely the case that there is no difference for use with broadcast HDTV signals or with DVD playback.  But if you plan to use the set with a PC, be absolutely sure you get the \"W\" and not the \"WA\" set.Now that I've got the correct model, I have to say I'd recommend it (the true \"W\" model) to anyone who wants to get a larger monitor to use with their PC as well as a solid LCD HD display for HDTV, DVD's and even SDTV.Of course, if you're not interested in the PC monitor function, then you can settle for the WA model and you won't be any worse for wear.A couple of other notes:  Don't even think of using the HDMI input for your PC display.  The VGA input uses true 1x1 pixel mapping (which is why the display on the W is so good at 1360 x 768), but like all LCD HDTV's the set employs a good deal of overscan with the HDMI (as well as component) inputs used to display HDTV.  This is acceptable for watching broadcast TV and DVD playback, but it doesn't work with PC displays.  Various people have tried to get it to work using Powerstrip (a very useful utility which allows one to design their own custom monitor timings for their PC to be able to use various HDTV's with either DVI inputs or HDMI) or the NVIDIA drivers.  It really doesn't work well, so unless you've got a lot of time and patience, don't even think about it.  You've got to use the VGA input which works very well.In my case, I have a dual display NVIDIA card and I use the Samsung as a 2nd monitor, to extend my desktop...But it's so cool to see the desktop really large, that I sometimes find myself using it as my primary monitor...Anyway, just be careful which model number you get if you decide to buy the 23\" Samsung LCD HDTV.", "Date": "February 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product!", "Author": "F.

It is comparable to my old Sony Trinitron monitor running at 1280 x 1024. It is also excellent for gaming (WoW). Btw, if you do plan to use it as a PC monitor, do spend the money on quality VGA cables. In the beginning I used a VGA cable bought from Bestbuy. For few hours there I thought LCD TV wasn't going to deliver the quality of pc monitor afterall. There was ghosting effect all over. I went online, ordered new cable UXGA ~$25. Problem fixed.

After doing a lot of research on HDTV's I chose this one for my bedrooom.  23'' inches is perfect considering I live in a one bedroom apartment.  People I worn you to play close attention to the HD inputs TV's have.  With technology rapidly changing and retailers trying to sell older goods, make sure you purchase a TV with and HDMI input.  Don't settle for a DVI input because it's a must that the audio be wired seperately.  This may cause your video and audio to be slightly out of sync, especially when watching live events.  Though HDMI cables can be costly they carry both audio and video signals.  And, if you lucky like me, your cable provider allows HD cable service at an extra minimal cost.  This experience was truely plug and play, except for the mounting time, and hiding the wires in the wall.  I've never spent so much damn time watching the discovery channel.  The sports look amazing and even the non-HD channels look more crisp.  Its even more of a plus if you have TIVO or DVR, you can watch the same jaw dropping segments over and over again.One downfall this television does have is that many other manufacturers harness their HDMI ports to the motherboard with one or two screws.  Samsung doesn't.  The first TV I bought worked great, then the HDMI port loosened from the motherboard, and wasn't functional.  The TV simply wouldn't recognize I had my HD cable plugged in.  I suggest buying an extended service plan with any piece of electronics over $250, yes this also applies to IPODS.

This can been seen everywhere on Xbox360 kiosks.  The contrast ratio is great, and the brightness is just right.  Picture very sharp.I then researched for months, with regards to the usablity of this LCD HD TV as a viable PC Monitor.  I found the information on the Amazon reviews lacking on this topic, so I will address it here.I bought a new, high end SVGA cable to go with my purchase.  I wasn't sure if my old video cable was fine or not, but at <$10, I ordered it together with this LCD TV.  I would urge you to do the same.  Setup was a snap, I plugged in my PC to the LCD, and it just boots up like any other monitor.  The LCD displays MANY resolutions, NOT just 1388 by 768.  My video card actually doesn't do that resolution, but I am using 1280 by 768, and I'm very impressed still.  The images are crisp and sharp, unlike your traditional LCD monitors, where if you don't use the native resolution, the picture looks like crap.One more thing, this HD LCD as a PC monitor can also run many low resolution games.

Noooooooo!  You have got to be kidding me! Arghhh! I had heard the rumors, but unfortunately I am now a statistic.  I have the Samsung LNR238W, so I pulled up the Samsung website and searched for their policy on dead pixels and this is what I found...One or two dead pixels out of the approximately 300,000 to 1.3 million pixels on a typical LCD television is normal. Generally, then, if you have only a few dead pixels, service is not an option.With that said, what we do about an LCD TV with dead pixels depends on:The number of dead pixelsThe location of the dead pixelsThe color of the dead pixelsThe size of the LCD TV screenI then called Samsung and I was told that the tolerance for my 23\" size LCD was 17+ pixels.  Needless to say, I am not very happy about this.  The single \"dead\" pixel is actually white in color and does not affect my gaming.  But I do see it when I am at the COD2 menu screen.  It's not that big of a deal, but the fact that this is not even covered under warranty is a little irritating.  Right now I am not sure whether I should hope that I don't get any more or that I get at least another 16 within the next 11 months.  Words to the wise for all of you LCD shoppers... check the manufacturer warranty on defective pixels!MY ORIGINAL POST:I did not want to take a chance with getting the \"A\" model, so I picked up this set from my local brick and mortar store. I did send an email to customer service and they said that they have resolved this issue; however I still did not want to take the chance.I specifically got this set for my XBOX 360 setup that I have in my computer room. In the end, I picked this tv because it had the following specs:1) Quick 12 ms response time2) Outstanding picture and Samsung quality3) 23\" because this is big enough for sitting up close to (3-4 ft)4) Speakers are under the screen which allows me to put my surround sound front speakers on the sides of the tv.5) The unit is tall enough that my center surround speaker can be placed in front of the tv and it does not block the viewThis tv passed all of these criteria with flying colors. I would also say that the built in speakers sound pretty good to me and if you are not in need of surround sound these should work just fine for most folk. The picture produced by my XBOX is outstanding: nice and crisp, great vivid color, a real joy to play COD2 on! This tv also looks wonderful just sitting on my desk. When my mother in-law saw it the other night the first word out of her mouth was \"BlinG!\" She just loved the way the tv looked just sitting there in the \"off\" position. And then when I fired up the XBOX and she got a look at those lovely menu screens I think that sold her on this set.As for watching tv, I can say that this is the best LCD out there. It does a great job with regular broadcast signals in both clarity and stretching a normal 4:3 picture. The Samsung stretches in a way that does not noticeable distort the image like most of the other brands do, including the more expensive Sony Bravia line. In regards to the size, this is perfect for me since I am sitting fairly close and playing games. However, if you are planning on sitting on a couch and watching from a distance you will probably want to go for the 26\". I would recommend that you measure the distance that you will be sitting from your tv at home and then go into your local store and watch the different screen sizes from that same distance (it doesn't matter what brand, just find out what size you will need before shopping brands). You may find that you need to get a larger screen, like a 32\". This process can be long and painful as it took me months (literally) to decide on a size and brand.As for my little 23\" Sammy, I could not be happier. If you need a 23\" LCD HDTV you will not be disappointed with this little gem! I highly recommend one especially if you are gaming with a 360.", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Beware!", "Author": "C.

I really disappointed after read manual. Samsung 23\" LCD TV has two different models. I think most people don't know about that. There is R238W(Resolution 1366x768) and R238WA(1280x720).Amazon selling R238WA, but they listing model is R238W. I think they ordered cheaper model from manufacturer and selling with higher resolution model name on it. (They changed later)Next day I called Amazon and asked to replace it, but she didn't recognized R238WA, anyway she offered $100 discount when I keep this TV.(not bad)But I was denied because my feel is not as good. After two hours later from end of call I got email from Amazon, about my new TV has already shipped out by second day air. WOW! very impressed. Even first TV is still in my living room. I was called Wednesday and Friday morning received replacement.Excellent customer service! Anyway disappointed again they sent same model again. I called and asked refund, I already printed postage-paid return shipping label from Amazon(I didn't open the box) and I return it tomorrow. I think they don't have #R238W model.Please anyone purchased this model #R238W from online store, please let me know which store has this TV. I think most online store selling #238WA(cheaper and low resolution) instead of #238W. I know that 1366x768 VS. 1280x720 video quality is not much different.(Just diff numbers)You can't find out this 238WA model from online search even Samsung home page.(very funny)Only find out from manual front cover and page 81.Sorry for the other story.Anyway I watched this TV two nights, and my experience of this TV is excellent quality and beautiful design.Picture is sharp and clear and nice touch from edge to edge and nice side buttons. On & off switch with melody option is good.This 23\"TV is large enough for 2-3 bedroom apt living room.When I installed this TV in my living room(2 bedroom). WOW!Feel is much larger than I thought.Remote control is simple and easy to use.But, one minus is (Anynet) function, (Anynet) means you can control your VCR and DVD player with your TV remote. But only available with Samsung brand. This is not big issue.I recommend this TV.This time I try to shop at local retail store.Sorry for bad English.Addition,Jan/24/06today I purchased this TV from Circuit city.Only paid $728. This week(Jan/22-Jan/28) Circuit city has big sale. This TV retail price is$999 but $100 price break and additionally 10% off on this TV, price tag is $809,I had 10% off coupon, I paid $728 plus tax total paid $765(best price ever at retail store}. Go hurry sale end this Saturday.But be carefull they have #238WA too!First time Circuit city staff brought #238WA, what a disappointed and I went to salesman and explained about what is wrong and he check the computer and went to back, few min later he brought #238W. I am lucky.So, you must check the serial number before take it to home.I really satisfied with this TV.Great quality and beautiful design.Highly recommend!Amazon has just model number changed but TV description is not changed.(This TV is diff resolution)", "Date": "January 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Wow!

It met my all my expectations and I give it my highest recommendation.  The following are my experiences while testing for problems.Pixel Response Time/Ghosting: Nonexistent.  I tried 480i signals through component, s-video, and composite and this lcd is just as responsive as a crt.Input lag: Nonexistent.  I heard of a problem that some hdtv owners(50\"DLP for example) experienced where there is lag or delay between the time they input a command on a game console and the time action appears on screen, due to video scaling or upconversion.  This problem would also manifest itself as unsynchronized video and audio when watching movies.  I was worried about it, but extensive testing showed that this monitor is free of this problem.  I tried Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for N64 (composite), Wave Race: Blue Storm for Nintendo Gamecube (s-video), Ninja Gaiden for Xbox (480i and 480p through components), Need for Speed Underground for Xbox (480i component), and Tekken 5 for PS2(480i component) and they all were responsive and fine, no problems.  Video was perfectly synchronized with the audio, which I ran through my hometheater system.Dead Pixels: My monitor didn't have any.Uniformity: My monitor didn't have this problem.  Colors appear as they should throughout the whole screen.  That is, there aren't any spots where red things show up green, for example.Quality of scaling: Solid image-wise, and no processing lag.  The video of non-native resolution signals that lcd's display are typically lower in quality than that of scaled signals on a crt.  However, this hdtv scales pretty well compared to other lcds, and I am completely satisfied with the image quality while I watch 480i/p video.  There is some noticeable pixelation and sharp edges sometimes on scaled 480i/p video, but that is to be expected - a crt would smooth those things over.Image geometry: perfect.  No bending, bowing, or other distortion you almost always get with crts nowadays.  Straight lines appear straight.I don't have a spare vga cable or an xbox 360 yet, so I haven't tested native resolution signals, but I'm sure they'll be excellent, I've seen xbox 360 running on this monitor at retail kiosks and the image is great - it's just a matter of whether a particular unit of this model is normal or not.As for the one review that mentioned input lag, maybe he reviewed a different tv by mistake, or had a defective unit, or was running his console through a pc tv tuner card through to the monitor or something unusual like that?  I don't know.This hdtv kicks butt.
