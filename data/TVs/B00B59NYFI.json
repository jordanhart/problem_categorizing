{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Good, The Bad, The Ugly", "Author": "Techno Geek", "ReviewID": "R3S47BHQ2BVDVI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just bought this new 2013 ET60 - 50 inch model from Amazon about one week ago. I previously owned a Panasonic 2012 ET5 model and a 2012 Samsung S6 6150 HDTV. I use the Digital Audio output to a Sony A/V receiver.THE GOODThe mechanical construction of the 2013 ET60 is very good. The bezel and stand are now a silver color which looks richer and matches my decor better (its very hard to find any Audio Video component that is not black - which looks like office furniture!). The stand is very solid construction, but does not swivel. The cable connections are parallel to the back panel, which allows the panel to be pushed up closer to the wall when using the stand (my previous Samsung had cable connections perpendicular to the panel, so it needed to stay at least 6 inches away from the wall, and you could see the ugly back cables when you passed by it).3D support - its awesome. The picture quality seems to have improved from last year, especially the 2D to 3D conversion (you can watch regular TV channels and convert them to a simulated 3D). Since there is little 3D content available, and very expensive, I will likely use the 2D to 3D conversion feature mostly. The screen also contains IPS technology, providing a good wide viewing angle. I have a bright room, and the picture looks good with little glare and no adjustment out of the box.The new Homescreen changes from last year's model improves the User interface greatly. You can customize the homescreen to add which Apps and browser shortcuts appear. The set will remember which homescreen you last used when it powers up again. You can turn this feature off if you wish, (as well as the annoying advertising banner).Internet streaming to TV is good, no stutter at all. The previous 2012 Samsung model I owned would need to buffer You-tube videos every 20 seconds, making it impossible to watch. I have wired Ethernet to both old and new TV.Swipe and Share feature. From my iPad, I can easily send stored pictures or video to the TV screen, with the Panasonic VieraRemote2 app. You need to use the browser function within the VieraRemote2 app which is limited to what the TV browser can support.The Panny ET60 supports wired keyboard and mouse only (NOT Bluetooth as indicated in the Amazon product info). I was able to use a Logitech M505 wireless mouse (non-bluetooth) that comes with a small USB dongle, which I plugged into the TV backpanel - it works great. The iPad Remote2 app contains a keyboard function, so I don't need any dedicated keyboard.THE BADYou want to watch foreign news or other non You-Tube video from the internet ? Many video streams still required Flash Player or Silver light - both are NOT supported. It kinda renders the browser app useless for me, since for most general browsing, I will use my iPad. Most TVs don't support Flash Player.The Amazon Instant Video App is over two years old, with no further updates available! No 5.1 sound, no Watchlist, awful old User Interface. I owned a 2012 Samsung TV and the same App was better, newer, had the watchlist etc. The new Panasonic remote now has a red Netflix button on it. We can only draw the conclusion that there is no further support for the Amazon Instant Video app on Panasonic TVs (since March 2011). This is looking like a possible deal breaker for me...There is no way to turn off the internal TV speakers if you use the Digital Optical Output only (without Viera Link hdmi) to your A/V Receiver ! I verified this with Panasonic tech support. You need to turn your speaker volume to zero (the mute function shows an ugly icon).The Media Player (files on USB stick) does not support 5.1 surround sound, only stereo (confirmed with Panasonic). The .avi type media files are not supported, only mp4 /mkv.THE UGLYYou will likely be comparing this model with the Samsung UN50F6400 model, which has about the same price point at the time of this writing. The Samsung has the black color with spider leg base, and supports Bluetooth keyboard/mouse and dual core processor. The Samsung has Active 3D (battery powered glasses). The Samsung's Amazon Instant Video app is much better, and there are more apps available in general with Samsung (even if you only really use 4 or 5 of them in the end ;-). I disliked the Samsung 2012 Series 6 remote, as the buttons were too small and placed in an awkward position - the Panasonic remote is better. Its a difficult choice in the end, it really depends on what features you use most, but so far I am happy with the Panasonic 2013 ET60 model for its mechanical and picture quality strengths - less the dated Amazon Instant Video app and lack of 5.1 sound on Media files.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV is great...", "Author": "KJMonte \"KJ\"", "ReviewID": "RGRL8A27JV0GV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has a great picture, sound, and Smart TV functions.

There are a number of key questions you have to ask:  What room will the TV be viewed in?  What type of content are you going to be watching?  Do you want 3D capability and/or internet connectivity?  Below are some of the pros and cons of this TV to help you decide if this television is right for you.A little about why I chose this TV --  I was looking for a new unit for my bedroom, one that was large enough for an immersive movie-watching experience.  I have owned many Panasonic TVs and they have always been very reliable, so my preference was to stick with that brand.  I wanted an LED model, one that was both 3D capable and also could access my Netflix account.  I decided on this model, and overall I'm very happy with my decisions.  The product is impressive in many ways, particularly in its image quality and easy on-screen navigation.  The only area I feel it is lacking is in both speaker quality and audio connection options...POSITIVES:- This TV is incredibly slim.  It comes with a sturdy base plate that is easy to assemble.  The overall build quality of the TV is great, and the frame is very small which is a nice aesthetic change from the thicker frames of just several years ago.- You can greatly customize every aspect of the TV, from the image and sound specifications, to parental controls, to changing your home screen layout.- Picture quality is awesome - it's full HD 1080p, and the 120Hz refresh rate is also very important if you do a lot of gaming or watch sports.  I'm sitting around 6-8 ft. from the screen and the 50\" display is just right... if you're sitting any further than that you might want to look into the 55\" model or larger.- The 3D quality is very high - it uses Passive 3D technology, which utilizes polarized glasses that create the stereoscopic 3D effect.  In my opinion, if you are new to 3D then passive (rather than active) 3D technology is the way to go - there is less eye strain, and the glasses are comfortable (especially if you already wear regular glasses).  Two pairs of glasses are included, and they're also relatively inexpensive if you need to pick up some extra pairs.- 3 HDMI input ports are included... that means the cable box, blu-ray player, and video game console can all be hooked up at once and ready to go.- A lot of discussion has taken place about the merits of LED vs. Plasma televisions.  It's worth researching and looking at both, but I prefer LEDs because they perform better in bright settings (such as a family room w/ large windows) and they also use less energy.- This is a \"Smart TV\" - that means it can connect to the internet via your Wireless router and you can get a variety of Apps.  For movie lovers, you can stream Netflix and Hulu.  If you're going to use an internet-connected device (such as a Roku box), then there's really no need to also have a Smart TV.  But it certainly doesn't hurt either, and you can always choose not to connect the TV to the internet if you prefer not to.- The remote control is very nice and it's not too cluttered.  It's quite similar the the Panasonic remotes of the last few years.  For those who watch a lot of Netflix, the remote includes a Netflix shortcut button.NEGATIVES:- The built-in speakers are okay, but not great.  They will do fine for watching the news, but if you are into movies/gaming then I'd definitely recommend using some type of sound system/sound bar.- No headphone jack.  I'd imagine this will be a big inconvenience to some, and I don't see why companies aren't including it on their TVs anymore.  There's no standard A/V output either, so the red-white audio to 3.5mm conversion cable won't work either.- Digital Coaxial Audio (this port is typically identified by the color orange) is NOT included.  This will only affect certain people with older audio equipment - most newer home theater units, receivers, and sound bars accept the Digital Optical input (which is compatible with this TV).- Despite being mentioned in the Amazon product details, this TV does NOT have Bluetooth.  I tried to connect a bluetooth device and it did not work; then I went looking into the TV settings and the manual and discovered that bluetooth is indeed not supported.- Its annoying that Panasonic chose to run banner ads on the TV by default.  This can be turned off by selecting \"Menu\" on remote, then choosing Setup >> Display Customization >> Smart Viera Banner >> Off.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV but reflective screen", "Author": "Viperboss7", "ReviewID": "R3NFK7VAV4Z4DQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV without being able to see it in the stores as nobody carried this 50\" model. I needed a TV for a family room/kitchen. It needs to be seen from multiple angles and not be too reflective from windows. I took back a top of the line Samsung because of reflections. This is an IPS LED tv which has an advantage of not bleeding colors when viewed from the side. The problem is, it does have a lot of reflections. Our kitchen lights showed up clearly on the screen. I am replacing a five year old Sharp TV that had a matte screen and worked well in that room. I am having a hard time finding a good tv that is not reflective. It seems to achieve the best picture, a more reflective screen is needed, so I think I have to downgrade the model to get less reflections, otherwise a Plasma tv would be best. The lower end Sharp and Samsung are less reflective so I guess I'm headed that direction. The TV itself is beautiful and easy to set. The colors are great and are very even when viewed from the side.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding in every way but one.", "Author": "Number Six", "ReviewID": "R2VLRBWBLYY0QX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Good: The feature set is huge.  There are a number of web apps, in my case available wirelessly.  I've only tried tried the Amazon video app and was reasonably pleased with the functionality.The fake 3-D is much better than I'd expected it to be.  A computer chip in the TV makes guesses as to how far back items in the display are then generates a 3-D rendition of the scene.  It occasionally gets depths wrong but I'm astonished at how often it does a good/great job.  In particular the TV usually does a good job of giving faces a realistic 3-D appearance. 3-D and fake 3-D weren't even remote drivers in my purchase decision - but now I'm sold.The Bad: Blacks are dark gray.

The LED (LCD) units are smaller, so you can get a bigger screen with it only taking up the same amount of space due to the smaller outer edges with no front facing speakers. This t.v., as with others I have looked at have very few hookups other than HDMI and USB. They only seem to have one component connection which is shared with an  RCA connection, so if you have any old equipment, you can't hook it up.  There are no S-video connecions, or fiber optic connections. Once again, this seems to be the case with all new \"flat\" t.v.'s, including this one.  Incidentally, my component connection doesn't seem to work on the red color, and my older DVD recorder transmits in a greenish yellow color to the t.v. .The t.v. otherwise has a great picture and puts out very little heat.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the lack of connections and the component color issue (which may not be related to the t.v., I am still investigating).Amazon shipped this to me in a HUGE box, which really pissed off the UPS driver.

Was very hesitant to purchase large item form amazon, I am no longer hesitant to do so. Researched over 2 years looking at prices and deals on all of the other TV products around.  I have owned this TV for over 3 months, it is a fantastic buy. Motion sports, Movies you name it no blur. Excellent off axis color due to the IPS panel technology, this is the same type technology that apple uses for there computer and notebook displays . I would buy this TV over and over again. TV looks a bit smaller then I expected, its slim bezel is perfect blends in with the surrounding decor well yet stands out as not just another black box.

Stylish, sturdy stand, super slim bezel and lightweight,  The picture quality is superb and watching sports in HD is a real pleasure.  Blu-ray viewing is incredible.  You will probably have to adjust the out-of-box picture settings to your liking as with most HDTVs.  Only downside to this TV is the glossiness/reflection, and I'm not surprised because reviews say this model is reflective.  During black scenes, the screen will reflect any light that is hitting it.  I watch lots of sports (which have no black scenes), so this is not an issue for me.  I can't wait to watch the World Cup games this summer.  Of course, viewing movies in the dark can eliminate this problem entirely.  If you plan to watch dark scenes in the daytime or with lots of lights on, a matte screen would be a better choice, unless the reflections don't bother you.  Haven't played games on this TV yet, but the reviews I read said this TV is excellent for gaming.  I'm hooking up the PS3 soon.Since 3D content is so limited, I have not gotten the opportunity to experience 3D on this TV.  It comes with two pairs of 3D glasses, so we can always try it if better 3D DVDs are released.  You can convert any 2D content into 3D by pressing the 3D button on the remote, although the effect is not that exciting...it just appears more vibrant but nothing jumps in front of your face.  Actual 3D content may be different.The smart interface is very simple and intuitive, and provides lots of apps/features for additional entertainment and convenience.  Streaming Netflix is fast (there is also a Netflix button on the remote for immediate access).  Web browsing is slower then on a computer, but no problem because it's a TV!  The 3 HDMI ports are adequate for me.  The 2 USB ports are useful if you have movies saved on flash drives.  You can install install the Panasonic remote app on your smartphone and use it as an extra remote, and yes it offers all the controls that the actual remote has.I researched TVs for a while before deciding to buy this one.  No regrets here.  Looks really modern and elegant and provides the picture quality you are looking for (unless the dark scene reflection is a deal breaker).  The added bonus of the smart features and 3D is really nice.  With the low price offered by Amazon, the extra 5-year warranty for $100 is a good choice also.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "Micah Ackerman", "ReviewID": "R1UBPD7L3KVRA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture/quality.

The black levels are good, not sure if i'd say inky but deep enough to satisfy all but the most discerning videophile. No dead and/or stuck pixels out of box which is always a good omen, as electro-omens go...... :)Colors and image detail are fantastic and the ability to dial-back the refresh rate (Strong, Mid, Weak or Off) allows the viewer to choose the fluidity of movement on-screen. Sometimes I want the 'Soap Opera Effect' (with sports and certain talk shows) however, most times it's not desirable (feature film or tv drama). It's a personal preference and it's nice to have control over it.In April/May 2013 this model was $1400, it's definitely worth that price but like all electronics (other than Apple) if you wait 6 months you can save significant cash if you hold off.

And because it is silver, it blends pretty well with the wall color so I feel like the bezel is not even there!  It gives me some bragging rights since most of my friends and family do not have a TV with such a nice looking bezel.- The picture quality right out of the box is breathtaking.  Way better than the similarly priced Samsung TV that I used for a few weeks.  I have not noticed any blur and picture fuzziness so far.  The colors are nice and smooth with no noticeable pixel'ation.- I don't have Netflix but I do use Amazon Prime.  The app loads quickly and the Wifi is pretty fast! Picture quality on Amazon Prime is really good.  My Wifi gives me about 6 mbps download speed.Cons:- I can't watch AVI format movies from my network drive.  I was able to do this with the Samsung TV which I returned, and was hoping that this Panasonic TV could do the same.

The TV was in it's factory carton deep within the huge shipping carton and we finally dug down to it and pulled it out. There was a huge trash bag full of a very unusual type of protection all around the TV. This has nothing to do with the built in defect but just to comment to our experience.  We installed the TV on the wall mount and were very pleased with the picture quality and clarity. I began trying to establish the internet connection via my wireless Belkin(N300) router.

He worked on the connection for several hours and finally gave up and went home to do some more research.

There is one speaker, facing towards the back, and the sound is like listening to someone in another room.No big deal, drive over to Best Buy, and get a soundbar. A Panasonic soundbar.The Viera Link, as the user guide explains, will enable the TV remote to disable the TV speakers and control the soundbar.Unfortunately, it doesn't.  After two calls to Panasonic tech support ( their tech support is very good, no complaints there) I was told that this Panasonic TV doesn't control this Panasonic soundbar.The soundbar has it's own remote, the size of a credit card, and the first time it hits the floor it would be swallowed by the dogs roaming under the table for leftovers.What I did was to disconnect the soundbar, got a Polk CsiA6 center speaker hooked up to an old Sony receiver, and now we get decent, if not terrific sound.  I'm not into home theater, all I want is to hear what the guy said about the weather.The two stars is for the Panasonic engineers who couldn't get their own product work properly with their own product.  I hope they can  read this and get their act together.Update: 6 months later we purchased a Samsung 55 inch 7100 set and this Panasonic was moved to a bedroom. Now it sits in a corner where the speaker is facing a wall, maybe 16 inches from the wall.  In this setup the sound is better.  Probably the resonance from the wall helps.  It's not great but quite acceptable without an added soundbar.To give Panasonic credit, this TV had terrific picture the moment it was turned on.

Remote uses AA batteries which makes it more heavy.It is difficult to find cables matching TVs color, also I couldn't find a matching color for Skype camera. TV did not play most of my DLNA videos.I returned this tv within a week and purchased SharpLC60LE650U, non 3D model.
