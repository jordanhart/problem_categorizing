I've had it for a few days now and it's everything I wanted and more. I have a one year old Samsung HDTV (their 530 series) and this HDTV is every bit its equal in terms of picture quality.

Good value, great picture, remote works great.  It's perfect, except for one thing: the volume.We have lived in three homes since we bought it (attempting to account for acoustics or distance from the TV to the couch here), and there is a problem with 13/14 volume.  On 13, you can barely hear the volume, and on 14, it's screaming at you.  Needless to say, we spend a lot of time toggling between the two volumes trying to get it right.Outside of the volume issue, no complaints.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "42\" TV", "Author": "mary Ann Cooper", "ReviewID": "R2NND4DFLPKWDH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything to order this was easy and just as they promised.

Was very annoyed but RCA did send someone to fix it being in 1 year warranty period. The fixing guys came and declared within no time that it is PCB problem. They ordered it from SEARS and went back.Meanwhile I discovered when I tap very hard on back of TV, colors became OK. But they might go bad anytime and I have to repeat the process.After two months part arrived and the fixing guys came back and replaced it. Just one more months into it TV started giving exactly same problem and then RCA would not fix it.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "WORST TV EVER", "Author": "Stanley", "ReviewID": "R2YTV4W1C88TUZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this for $499.99 from BestBuy. About 80 days after I bought there was bar/vertical stripe on the left side . Video wasn't that great to start out with. Unfortunally I didnt purchase the geek squad warrenty with bestbuy (dumb me) and thank goodness it had a 1 year manufracturer warrenty. But its ridiculous to deal with the manufacturer. After like 2 months dealing with them, I got tired and bought a new one from best buy and took the other one back and got a refund. And now the brand new out the box not even a month theres a line that wants to pop thru. I WIll NOT and emphisise NOT be buying any more RCA products. A TV should not break after 3 months. That's why they sell it cheaper.

Naturally, service is only available a couple of weekdays out of the week, and no drop-off is available.  So, if you happen to have a, whaddayacallit, JOB, this is decidedly difficult to work out.

I have a 46\" tv like this one and this one and they both are great tvs. My girlfriend loves her 46\". Netflix, direct tv, dvds, and apple tv all look great on the 46\". I decided to buy the 46\" because of the price and it was the best thing we ever did. I now am buying the 42\" for another room in our house. I have used the 42\" a few times and wow it is great. RCA isn't LG or Sony if you try to hold it up to those then you will for sure be sad. It is a TV, if it looks good and has sound then don't sit there are wish you had an LG or Sony. I would buy more of these tvs because they are great and i got it for only 388 so that is a steal in itself.What is this about the picture speed is to slow. I would check to see if you have cable or satellite because this tv has just as great picture speed as any other so it is probably your cable/satellite box or old dvd player. thanks amazon for a great tv at a great price.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review", "Author": "derymax", "ReviewID": "R25112PSHHBLEU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great product, i like it and the seller was quick to ship the product.

The only issue was that one of the HDMI ports was loose, but the others worked fine.I've had the tv for 5 months and one day the picture started fading out beginning on the left and worked its way across the screen within 5 minutes. Luckily I bought a one year warranty from the store in light of the reviews I had seen.I am obviously not happy with this product anymore. If you're the type of person who updates their gadgets every few months anyway, go for it (and buy the warranty while you're at it).

I did look at the reviews by others,especially the negative ones, but chose to ignore them in view of the money saved. BIG MISTAKE! To begin with, it took about 5 weeks to get this TV because it was on back order. The TV worked exactly 30 days; the video faded out as we were watching and the sound faded out a little bit later. I talked to Sears Repair service. Three days later, they sent a service guy to repair at home (which is nice). The service guy said that two boards were defective and he ordered the parts. He made an appointment to come back the following week. Then I get a message from Sears saying that the parts are on back order and I may have to wait another 2-3 weeks. I am fed up with the quality of this TV and Sears. In my 40 years of TV buying (14 TVs), I never had a TV conk out on me before 3 years. I am going to Sears to talk to the manager and return the TV. This is a major hassle because of the time,aggravation,and physical strain of returning the TV. My suggestion to the potential buyers is-not to make my mistake. If you buy this make and model of  TV, you are taking a chance because there appears to be no quality control.
