This is a great TV for smaller viewing areas like a den, bedroom, etc.  I'm giving 4 stars mainly for the speakers.

Theisen", "ReviewID": "R35Z4SDV61YMAM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this thing... not everyone has room or a budget for something 30\"+ 40\"++ or lives somewhere with vaulted ceilings. At this size, it's perfect for a bedroom or small den. Love the look-- the piano black is lovely and matches other Sony products if you happen to have them (a small theater system and Playstation 3, in my case). While shopping around, I realized that a 1080p would be overkill for a smaller area and were much costlier, and this is a great choice if you care about product brand when making larger purchases while still getting all the features you'd expect out of fancier models of others. Are you paying a little more for the name? Likely, but that can be important for a lot of people, too.Upgrading to a full HD television service is not in the works for me right now and I mostly purchased this for Blu-Ray and the Playstation 3, but normal cable still looks great and this Bravia series has an absolutely great screen display on 'wide zoom' to where you can get a full-screen image without strange stretching and you can still even read the tickers on news or sports channels.Critiques? The sound is somewhat disappointing with iffy bass and muddled clarity, which could get to movie fans. A few things can be frustrating such as channel change time and its dimming feature... sometimes it almost feels like you have to go through a few too many menus, as well. I think the dimming is great the majority of the time, but it outsmarts itself by readjusting because the TV changes the nearby ambient itself with a white picture! These confusions could be troublesome to the non technologically-inclined who just want to turn something on and channel-hop, which is the only reason I can't give a 5/5. Still, there's no reason I wouldn't highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Quality product, great image", "Author": "Kevin W. Parker", "ReviewID": "RNE9ZADSAN96O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm probably not the best person to review a TV set because the only other one I'm thoroughly familiar with is the 25-year-old RCA set that this one replaced.Anyhow, I'm very happy with the decision. The image is very crisp and clear, and there are numerous input options. I've managed to set up three different feeds into the TV: one from the cable box, one from the DVD player, and one direct from an antenna. All of them work well.If you're used to an old-fashioned TV set that you just turn on and off and change channels on (as I was), this one may take some getting used to as among various other options you can choose among multiple inputs and decide whether you want the image to be normal-sized, widened, or zoomed.That is in fact my one quibble, though I'm not sure if it's the TV's fault or what: I would like to be able to get an image that takes up as much of the screen real-estate as possible without being stretched in any way, and in some configurations that just doesn't seem to be possible. Either there's wasted space around all four edges, or it's zoomed so that the edges of the image are off the screen.But all-in-all I'm very satisfied with both the quality and the price.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good stuff", "Author": "Chris Mcdonough", "ReviewID": "R3QWWKS1L5YP71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is used in my \"study\".  It has the following devices attached to it:- A Dell Hybrid Studio PC (Windows Vista) via HDMI- A homebuilt PC (Ubuntu 8.10) via VGA (aka the \"PC\" port)- A Sony Playstation 2 via composite.- An XBox (original) via composite.Everything works as you'd expect so far.  In particular, the Hybrid (Intel 965 chipset) running Vista is able to drive the TV *over HDMI* in its native 1360x768 resolution (the EDID has the correct info).  This was a problem with a Samsung I bought and returned.  Likewise, the homebuilt PC system (also an Intel chipset) has no problem driving the display at its native resolution (the Samsung could do this too, it just had problems accepting PC signal at native resolution over HDMI because its EDID was wrong).  I have ordered component cables for the Playstation and XBox but they both work OK over composite (albeit not at 720p).I am currently having a slight problem where the \"HDMI 1\" port loses sync to the Hybrid causing the TV to \"flash\" (loses both picture and sound at random intervals for a few seconds).  Moving the connection to the HDMI 2 or 3 ports solves the issue, so I suspect it's just a connector problem.  I will likely exchange it for this reason.I'd recommend this TV to others.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buy something else", "Author": "Bill Wolf \"Mr Bill\"", "ReviewID": "R1GXZODOKZYATE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The screen has some kind of auto dimming that can't be turned off with any of the settings.

We already had our own Sony Bravia 42 inch TV at home, and we love it.No doubt there are cheaper LCD HD TVs out there, but you know when you get a Sony that you are going to get good quality. This Bravia series is no exception. The picture quality is astounding, especially when watching sporting events - you can see every face in the crowd.I don't have much new to add to a review for this TV other than a simple warning that seems obvious - take a look at this TV at the store before you make your purchase online. When I bought this one I figured a 26 inch would be just perfect for my son, remembering my old \"giant\" 25 inch screens from the past.  However, when this one arrived, it seemed so small.

Foley", "ReviewID": "R24VLMNT4957KL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We replaced our 10-year old Sony bedroom TV, which got a lot of use, with this 26-inch set. I chose this size because it was the largest that would fit in the existing cabinet, and this particular TV for the brand and the price ($329/free shipping). The set is lightweight, the picture is excellent, it was very easy to set-up, and the sound is quite adequate for the space.There are a few minor annoyances, however: 1) all the on-screen menus, channel information, and so on is very, very small and cannot be read unless one is, say, 3-4 feet from the TV; 2) the sleep timer is accessed through one of these mini-menus rather than by a button on the remote (the good news: the remote for the old Sony--which has a sleep button--actually works with the new TV); and 3) the wide/normal/etc. settings for the picture do not 'stick,' which means that each time you turn it on, it returns to the default, stretched picture, requiring a manual change if that's not your preference.I suppose we will get used to these things, but one does have to wonder about the thinking that went into these design decisions. Given the aging population and 'universal design' considerations, the tiny text seems a particularly poor choice--I've been wondering if they just scaled down their large-model protocol without fully considering the result in a smaller set that would very likely be used in a bedroom and therefore viewed from a distance at least equal to the length of a bed.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Looks and sounds really good to me....", "Author": "MayB \"artist2artist\"", "ReviewID": "R312NJ4SHR1FKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is, without hesitation, the best TV I have ever had.

Sound is good..don't find that there is any distortion nor muffling.  The only possible drawbacks are with the \"new\" technology per se, which is common to ALL TV's:  1- Sound volume will vary from channel to channel, and sometimes even from program to commercial, so one has to constantly be prepared to adjust accordingly.  This did not happen with my old set, as there was some way that sound could be regulated to be consistent, so there is no \"improvement\" on that score.  and 2- Again, \"new technology\" is with the picture size variations one sometimes need to play with in order to achieve a comfortable viewing format.

It turned out to seem a little small. As others have said, when you go from a tube TV to a flat screen, you get much more TV in much less space. Anyway, I returned the Samsung. I was going to get a 22-incher, but was convinced to move up to 26. The TV is nice. These might be minor complaints---but we have basic cable...with the Samsung, the local HD channels (ABC, CBS, NBC & Fox affiliates, and a few more) were on the corresponding channels with our cable guide---the CBS affiliate was channel 202, etc; with the Sony, the local HD channels are all over the place---channel 77.2, channel 123.7, etc. Also, the remote is poorly designed, in my opinion. The jump button is one of the best inventions ever. Why does this remote have it way at the bottom of the device, where it's hard to hold/manipulate. The + and - channel buttons are also at the bottom. It would be nice to have those buttons in the middle of the remote.So far, so good with the picture. The HD channels are really nice. The non-HD ones come in fine, but they're really nothing special to look at.

It's very light weight as well. The set up is very self explanatory, the tv walks you through it  Although at first scan, it didn't pick up all my antenna channels but that was easily rectified by moving my antenna and rescanning.  I have always owned Sony, my trinitron lasted over 25yrs so when I went looking for a flat screen I looked there first.  I was open minded enough to look at others but found that Sony had the best picture overall, in the stores at least.  Upon getting it home however, I did have a problem with the first set I received.  Amazon was amazing once they got them in again (as they had sold out of them for a while and if I had sent it back immediately then it would've meant a refund only which I didn't want).  The exchange was effortless, I had another set in my home in 3 days and this one is much better.  I still have some people's scalps floating away from their heads but that problem is fixed if I go to the regular channel on the antenna rather than relying on cable (it only seems to happen on one channel now so far and that, thank goodness, is a network channel).  Otherwise, all seems to be ok, my other problems with the other set have disappeared, it's only been 2 days, but they were pretty evident almost immediately last time so I think I'm pretty safe, although I'll probably still be knocking on wood for a couple of weeks.  I only wish that this was an 1080p as I think the picture problems probably wouldn't be happening if this were the case.  Yet despite the problems with the floating heads, and of course movies and programs not made for HD which one would not expect to show up as if they were, the colors are fabulous and picture is wonderful.  One can adjust to 3 different brightness options for viewing which is a very nice feature.  Overall I'm happy with the tv, it fits where I need it to fit which was my biggest problem, finding a tv which was this size but less than 19 1/2\" high and still a good tv, of course I wish it had more inputs (yet perhaps as I update everything else that will no longer be an issue, who knows) and more options but that being said, it is a good tv for the money.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!!", "Author": "Patrose", "ReviewID": "R2QP5I7J8JDMQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony Bravia (we purchased the 26\") was a great purchase...Consumer Reports recommended it & also recommended buying it on Amazon.com for the best deal.

Be aware that some stations (our local PBS, for one) seem to be fascinated by \"artfully\" switching picture sizes during the broadcast.

I'm attempting to return this set today, as further viewing with all that red and anemic blue is simply too annoying and can't be corrected. If you don't mind this -- to me -- serious problem, it's your choice. But surely SONY should be able to do better than this.) Purchased from eDirect before I found Amazon's listing. I was swayed by all the 5-star reviews at Amazon (nowadays, as viewed in showroom setups, there's no way to judge image quality). The mosquito noise seen in showrooms appears in my living room as well, though it's not as prominent as on other LCD's. As for comments about \"great color\", I'm not sure what that oft-used phrase is supposed to mean; this tv is deficient in Blue and has a 25% Red push that glows like neon and often bleeds like the reds on dirt-cheap store brand CRT's. The SONY at least has RGB adjustments, although RGB Gain can only be reduced, not increased -- a really odd design. In one picture mode, Red is pushed 34%, which looks bizarre but which apparently appeals to \"great color\" enthusiasts. Sadly, SONY doesn't provide color Y-level controls, not even in the miniscule service menu. In Cinema/Warm Mode the grayscale RGB is admirably flat except for a typically elevated Blue \"leg\" from 40-IRE on down; most LCD's have such grayscales, ostensibly to make blacks look darker (actually, it just makes blacks look blue, not black. The value R16G16B16 (digital black) is a color rarely seen on HDTV's). After some drastic and very tricky RGB adjustments with help from a colorimeter and HCFR software, blacks looked more neutral and the Red push was made at least tolerable, but high-red gamma suffered somewhat. At least it kept most skin tones from looking like terminal cases of third-degree burn, although fair-skinned people often have an unsightly hot-pink tint. The overall image is suitably contrasty and sharp, and SD sources look much cleaner than with most LCD's. With HD and SD, there's some noisy moire in fine-grained objects like sequinned gowns and heavy wool coats, and shimmer when very high-contrast objects move. But those effects are common on many LCDs. Low-IRE gamma is a bit aggressive, making some darks look rather inky, especially with BluRay; thankfully there's a backlight control that helps a bit. Motion is mostly handled well, even without 120-hz gimmicks (which don't work anyway, because refresh rate isn't the source of LCD motion blur). Turn off noise reduction, which adds its own artifacts and makes motion blur worse. Thankfully I haven't seen judder or stutter so far, but I saw a mild case of upscaling jaggies. With a pristine image source, the overall picture is better than average and looks quite sharp and snappy, without phony edge enhancement. I measured the real-world contrast at around 2100:1, an impressive figure, with excellent darks and crisp whites: black and white movies play nicely. Less perfect sources (low contrast, noisy, low-density scenes in fog, heavy rain, etc.) just look smeared and murky -- this is digital video's fault, not SONY's. BluRay looks very punchy and sharp, though BR compression artifacts are easy to spot. As far as a generally cleaner image is concerned, SD-DVD looks much better on this set than on other 26-inchers I've seen. At this size, the difference between 720 lines and 1080 couldn't be seen, even with a 37\" 1080p sitting beside it. If your BluRay player outputs 720i or 720p, set it that way; HD-DVD downscaling doesn't play well here. The tuner is fairly fast; channel cruising is a bit slow, but I've seen much worse. Setup instructions warn that channel scanning takes 50 minutes; my scan found 100-plus cable stations in 12 minutes. Audio ain't great, but it's cleaner and louder than averege and works well from its coax output (but no headphone jack!). Viewing angle is narrow, about 15 degrees either side, a tad wider than some others. Overall I'd say it's an above-average LCD, aided by limited RGB controls but marred mostly by annoying Reds and absent the full-featured CIE adjustments found on some sets. It nicely replaces the average low-quality generic 20\" or 24\" CRT. But if your old, higher-end smallish CRT still works well and can be calibrated, stick with the tube.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Sony Product", "Author": "Kathleen Keller", "ReviewID": "R1NNJ4Y52S0EQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this Sony T.V.

No Tint calibration.  Colors are too bright but pale colors are too bland.  Also, faces are often blurry. I went through the display settings but the color settings did not improve.  And the sharpness setting did not change the blurry quality of the picture.And if you use a satellite connection, the TV identification of the programs/channels does not work.  Only your satellite remote control will assist you in identifying what program and channel you are watching.A grand disappointment after reading the glowing reviews for this TV on Amazon.

Then my father bought a bigger HDTV for a HD converter box from CABLEVISION. Well I bought this HDTV from AMAZON for my mother in the upstairs living room for my satellite tv not just to expierence HD but to expierence real digital tv. Well I just bought a smaller HDTV for my father in the garage for father's day ( I had to order another HD converter box from CABLEVISION. I now made my family HD crazy! But my family is so serious about television I decided it would be smart to make all our tv service with as much HD as possible and be 100% digital. I actually have both cable and satellite (DISH NETWORK) because I wanted it both ways (now that's being serious). I now wonder how many U.S. households have four HDTVs?
