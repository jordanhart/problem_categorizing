Most people buying a \"40 inch-er\" or larger are lured to a 120 hz model (like EX-500 or EX-700). The EX-600 has a 60 hz scan.  Save yourself a couple hundred bucks; you won't notice the difference for moving objects.  It doesn't have internet features or DNLA capable but I'm planning on hooking up a spare Mac Mini over an HDMI port for a straight shot to the internet.Best I can tell, the EX-600 is roughly equal to the Sony Google TV without the Google part, but $200 less and in a more attractive slim black body.I did a lot of research before buying as my last TV was a gigantic 200 lb. 35\" Sony XBR tube TV.  The EX-600 is a pretty fine machine.I'm quite pleased with the picture and adjustments.  At first it seemed too much bubble-gum colors and bright but after making adjustments in the settings menu, I toned things down and also adjusted the backlighting and this machine delivers beautiful realistic colors and black blacks. Absolutely no light bleed from the LED edge lighting.I bought mine local since it was cheaper (with tax) than anywhere else, including on-line.  Like i noted earlier, this 40\" model appears to be not selling too well.Pick one up before they are gone.  It's definitely a winner.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding TV, Get it while you can, it's discontinued.", "Author": "William Westbrook", "ReviewID": "R29YSHFBRW8ZWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always been impressed with Sony quality, and I have a certain amount of brand loyalty. When I started looking for a replacement for my 25\" Sony Tube TV, I checked out the LG and Samsung TVs, and always kept coming back to the Sony. This model has been discontinued in favor of the TVs with more gadgets, and bells and whistles. I wanted a TV with outstanding picture and this is what I got. I didn't need impressive audio from the TV, as I route audio to my Sony A/V receiver. Took this jewel out of the box, turned it on, and after a few menu setups, I had an amazing picture. I work as an engineer, and I have discerning eye for quality, and this TV produces an image that is so much better than what I have had to put up with for so many years. Granted the TV is still 60 hz scan and not 120 hz or 240 hz, but that doesn't seem to bother me. When we were looking for a particular TV that provided value for the price, I was really impressed.  You can spend a lot more and I don't think you get twice the image.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stellar  Sony LED TV", "Author": "Marie", "ReviewID": "R1Q1M767WWA9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This television came highly recommended to me by a friend who researches and is a well  know Techie.  I had also checked out the tv by going to Best Buy,Sears, Frys and other online stores. I found that this tv had excellent picture quality. I was very amazed by the sound quality too. This was before I had hooked it up to the surround sound. I sometimes listen to it without the surround sound and it has the best sound I ever heard on a tv with out the suround sound. Needless to say I love this TV, the LED picture is Awesome and the sound is great.  Thank you Sony:)", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Off-axis viewing is horrible", "Author": "M. Block", "ReviewID": "RQ4F35FOGWTD0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I can barely live with this TV because it's very washed out off-axis. The good viewing angle is about 20 degrees; the farther off axis, the more washed out it looks. I have two other LCDs (Samsung and LG) and they don't have this problem at all. I have to assume it's a problem with Sony's implementation of LED backlighting; turning the backlighting down to the minimum helps, but then the TV looks very dull.Out of the box the calibration is pretty bad. You have to turn off all the processing and set it up manually, after which the color looks OK on axis.The only reason I'm not returning it is that the slim design perfectly fits into our TV cabinet; other 40\" sets are too big by fractions of an inch.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding!!!!!!", "Author": "Grandpa Pipes", "ReviewID": "R1EWYKA7A7PU4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Moving from a Sony 32\" Wega ( a great TV also!)

The set up was fairly easy after going to the Sony website. The instructions with the set and the instructions with the Cable TV box are confusing, but Sony has an interactive website where you can choose the components you have and get precisely the hook-ups you need to make. We found the picture quality is excellent with the default settings and have made no adjustments; sound quality is also very good. We chose this model because it fits our needs - didn't need bells and whistles of the more expensive models. However, there are plenty of inputs if you want to hook up games, a pc, or other components. We have found no problem with picture or viewing quality at 60hz. We are very pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just Beautiful!", "Author": "jalywol18", "ReviewID": "RZ1G25803S2BU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an old 32\" off-label tv that needed replacement this year, so I was looking for a good 37-40\" tv to replace it.  After trying three other brands (LG, Vizio, Samsung) I came across this one in a package deal with a PS3 (figuring I could sell the PS3 and just keep the tv).  I set it up, turned it on, and was just blown away by the picture quality.  Of all of the others I had tried, this is the only set that gets the colors, just RIGHT.  Skin tones are just beautiful, whether the person has dark, medium, or fair skin.  I find I do not have to adjust the color every time a new show comes on or I switch stations (the LG had a problem with that).The sound is completely acceptable; no, it is not going to thunder you out of the room, but clarity and tone are very good (if I want thunder I can hook it up to an external speaker system).In summary:Pro:Phenomenal color.Reasonable soundSmaller bezel (fits more places with less room)Even though it is 60Hz, it does motion without blur.Cons:Slightly more reflective screen than my old set; can see window reflections during sunny day unless you have a darker curtain over window across the room from it.(This also has a much nicer picture than the Sony KDL 40EX400, which I had tried and was not impressed with.)Overall I am delighted with this model and would recommend it highly.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent quality for the price", "Author": "Matthew J Felt", "ReviewID": "R34IRQBDLFH7Q1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Found this in a local Best Buy for $650 (store sale, couldn't pass it up).  Had good reviews online so I went for it.  Was not overly impressed with the LED backlit picture, seemed very washed out and took some tweaking to get it more tolerable.  Now that we're getting used to the LED lighting vs our older CFL model we're struck by how bad the audio is.  True, the speakers are aimed down and the tv sits in a cabinet, but the bass levels are nearly non-existant and the treble sounds tinny even at lower levels.  I suppose now I'll have to break down for a speaker/theater system...not exactly how I wanted to spend the savings on the tv.I'll probably keep this since it was a heck of a deal but am not sure I'd buy another one or even recommend it (since prices are still $799 for this model everywhere I look).", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic HDTV for a Low Price", "Author": "Addison Dewitt \"I'm nobody's fool.\"", "ReviewID": "R2F1U0YRK5WBOW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the first \"big screen\" TV I have purchased. I've looked at them for years, waiting for something that I felt was a good value for the money. I've waited through rear-projection, front projection, plasma, LCD, and now LED. There have been some huge monsters that weighed tons and some of them have been downright ugly. However, this TV was light, sleek and beautiful and came up for a weekend sale at Target.  I got a huge discount (probably because this model is being discontinued as I write) and brought it home about 4 weeks ago.It was easy to set up and easy to program. I was up and running in no time, but felt the TV picture was just OK... it was nice, but not what I'd experienced in the store.  But... after I finally discovered where my HD channels were, I was completely blown away! This TV is amazing.Pros:Blacks are very pure, colors are all adjustable to your own taste and the Bravia engine really does what they say, it reduces noise and makes the screen very clean looking.  Sound is really good even without additional speakers. The controller is easy to use and very easy to figure out if you don't understand something, just read the manual, it's not very thick even if you are. Picture is quite brilliant and the matte surface makes it easy to watch, even during a sunny day.  Love that this thing can turn on angles, so everyone gets to see well, no matter where they sit.Cons:Absolutely HATE the start-up sound and there's no way to get rid of it on this particular model, believe me, I've looked and looked. As well, you can't control the volume of that sound either, it's loud even if the TV sound is down previously.  The name of this TV is a bit misleading, I was convinced I bought an LED TV, but then later found out that this is a \"backlit\" LED - LCD TV, which is not the same at all. It's a hybrid and while I'm still in awe over the look of this set, I'm still a bit stymied over the fact that they are using the acronym LED at all, it felt like \"bait and switch\" to me, thus the 4 instead of 5 stars for this and the other previously mentioned con. But hey, that's only 2 cons!I still am impressed and really like this set and hope that I get many years of use out of it. My previous set was a 27-inch Zenith Colortrac tube set which worked flawlessly for over 25 years and STILL looked modern and new when I took it to Goodwill.

[They] were no longer going to \"carry this model anymore\". It was 1 of 2 that they had left (1 IN the box & the other A DISPLAY...in great condition!) I ended-up getting the one that was IN the box...for $675. BTW, the DISPLAY model was only $573, and NOT A THING WRONG IT!! However, I felt \"better\" getting the NEW one.Anyway, after tax, tag & title...I ended-up spending $730. I just didn't feel right about having that much money sitting on a table. I wanted to see if I could get a \"NON\" Smart TV, that was in the 40\", $300 range. So, after a few days of \"mulling-it-over\"...I returned the Samsung. HOWEVER, before I did that, I went to BestBuy and talked to a TV geekster, and, it turned-out they had a Sony BRAVIA KDL40EX600, 40-Inch LED, 120hz, 1080p, HDTV...hangin-on-the-wall, as a display (discontinued model)...for several months. It had NO box, NO stand, NO remote and NO manual. BUT, it had the RIGHT PRICE...$199!! Badabing!! They included a Sony \"Learning\" Remote (for free) and a Rocketfish, full-motion wall mount for 50% off (that cost me $60 after the discount). I purchased an additional, 2 year warranty (for $25). So, for $284 +tax (@ 7.5%)....I got was I was looking for.Now, if you remember I went from a Smart TV to NON Smart TV. The fix? I bought the Samsung, Blu-Ray, 3D, DVD player (model #BD-F5900)...which had the Smart Hub technology built-in. Cost? I paid $119 @ Walmart.Finally, I got curious to see if I could get the DVD player, somewhere else, for a few bucks less? As destiny would have it, I found the same Samsung DVD player (BD-F5900)...RIGHT HERE...on Amazon.com...for $60 +$4.95 shipping!!In closing, I want to say that my initial purchase for the Samsung TV, without a DVD player...was $730, including tax. The Sony BRAVIA KDL40EX600, 40-Inch LED, 120hz, 1080p, HDTV, Black TV was $199, plus $65 (for the wall mount), $25 (for the extended warranty), plus $64.95 (for the Samsung DVD from Amazon) = #353.95 + TAXABLE merchadise of $21.25 = $375.20. For an overall savings of (tadaaaa!!) $354.80. Not bad?As for the Sony TV??? I LIKE IT A LOT!!!

After my repeated calls, after being on hold while someone called dispatch to find out that the driver arrived at Target Lowell too late, and the Target Lowell manager refused to release the TV to the Zip driver/installer, somehow, finally, Target released the TV and it was delivered around 5:30pm to my home.

I had re-arranged my work schedule and this was a huge inconvenience and waste of time.
