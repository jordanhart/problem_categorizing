{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My First Flat Panel TV (with Review Updates)", "Author": "Dre", "ReviewID": "R3NHB7A049GO81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I took the plunge and finally upgraded my bedroom TV to a Flat Panel Samsung LED 720p 32\" (Model UN32EH4003). I bought it during the Black Friday time frame directly from Amazon for $247.99 (Free Shipping, 14-Day Price Guarantee).  I went in knowing that I was buying the cheapest 32\" Samsung Flat Panel that you could buy and knew that I wasn't getting every bell and whistle, which is fine with me.  My goal for this TV is to use it as a bedroom TV with a Verizon FIOS cable box and a media player (Ethernet connected, not WiFi) and watch it from about 8 feet away.  No gaming, minimal DVD, etc.  That's basically it.Just for some background, I'm upgrading from an old 20\" Generic Tube TV in the bedroom.  I do have an HDTV in the living room, but it is also a Tube TV.  There I have a 34\" Sony widescreen Tube TV that I bought about 7 years ago that was basically the biggest widescreen Tube TV made that I know of.  Back then a Tube TV picture was much better and cheaper than Flat Panel.First Impression - This TV looks nice.  Clean front.  It is extremely light.  The base feels sturdy and big enough to support the TV without risk of falling over.  It was simple to put together with 8 screws in the base.Setup - It has 2 HDMI's and then some regular RCA and Component hookups.  My setup consists of Verizon FIOS Cable Box and a WD Live TV Media Player (to be replaced by a Boxee Box within the week, but that's another story).  Plugged the Cable Box and the Media Player into each HDMI port using new Amazon Basics HDMI cables.  The TV on-screen setup was easy enough to figure out without pulling out the instruction manual.  Everything came up perfectly the first time with just a press of the Source button.Picture Quality - I tested the TV out with several different types of media and sources.1) First with SD Cable.  A little blocky up close, which may just be the source, but from a normal viewing distance, I the quality was just fine.  The kids' cartoons were fine.2) Second with HD Cable.  This picture seemed really nice.  Didn't see any kind of distortion.  Seemed nearly as good as the HD Tube TV that I have downstairs from an 8 foot viewing distance.  I was happy with what I saw.3) Third with a normal 720p Video file via the Media Player.  Picture was really nice in this case also.  Everything seemed crisp.  Very happy.4) Finally with a fast motion 1080p Video file via the Media Player.  This is where I expected the worst, but to my surprise, the fast motion scenes seemed fine also.  I only tested a couple of files, so we'll see if other scenes have a problem, but so far so good.Overall I was very happy with the picture quality.  The colors on the default setting were pretty terrible, so I tried the presets and settled \"Dynamic\" Picture Mode and Cool Color Tone in the Picture Options setting which was pretty much perfect in all instances.  Looked pretty natural with nice colors.Viewing Angles - Side viewing angles seemed really good.  This was one of my pet peeves and most of my reluctance to move to a flat panel TV in the first place.  Many flat panel TV's look terrible when you aren't watching it straight on.  This TV seems to have much better side viewing than many of the competing TV's out there.Screen - The screen edges do have a few very faint white areas that I have noticed, but they are barely noticeable and only when the screen is completely black.  I don't notice it at all when there is any kind of picture on the screen.  I probably only see it because I am looking for it after reading a few comments about backlight bleed.  For me, it doesn't seem like anything to worry about.  I always buy SquareTrade warranties with all my electronics, so if the screen does have a problem, I will be set.Sound Quality - This is where I had the most trouble.  Granted, I'm upgrading from a old TV, but out of the box, the Samsung sounded very hollow and words were hard to understand.  It seemed to be completely missing any low end, not talking about booming bass, just lower frequencies seemed to be missing.  I tried every sound preset that they had and all were pretty bad.  I finally gave up on the presets and used the included 5 band Equalizer which finally did the trick.  Per request, I posted a picture of the settings in the customer images section of this item.  [THIS SECTION HAS BEEN UPDATED BELOW:  I basically maxed out the low and high frequencies and made a bell curve of the middle frequencies, raising the one that controlled voices until I has happy.  This seemed to do the trick just fine and I am now happy with the sound.]  Granted, if you are expecting a booming surround sound feel, you're shopping for the wrong TV, but for what I think this TV is meant for, it sounds just fine.Bells, Whistles and Other Stuff - I haven't toyed with this TV too much yet.  There are lots of menu settings to go through.  The power button on the bottom of the TV seems pretty cool.  It is like a combined button/joystick that pulls up a menu when pressed that you can use the button to move through, or just turn off the TV.  I won't use it much since the Cable Box remote will do most of the work, but it is a nice to have since the actual TV remote will probably sit in a drawer once everything is set up.  It does have a USB port that is supposed to play pretty much any type of media format.  If this works well, it is a great feature.  For me, I plan on continuing to use a dedicated Media Player, so I probably won't use this much, but for anyone else, it would save you $100 on having to buy a media player if you have a use for it.I've only had this TV for one day, but this is what I think so far for a pro/con list.Pros:1) Great price ($247.99 at the time I purchased it, put a camelcamelcamel price alert on it for when the price drops again).2) Great picture quality, especially for the price.3) Very good side viewing angles.4) Easy setup and connection to Cable Box and Media Player.5) Enough picture and sound settings to get the quality you want for your individual preference.6) Fast motion scenes seem ok so far.7) Energy Star cost of $6-$12 per year to operate.  That just sounds crazy, but I'll take it.Cons:1) Sound presets are terrible, but can be adjusted manually.2) Concern about possible backlight bleed, but covering myself with an inexpensive SquareTrade warranty.In conclusion, I'm giving this TV a 5 Star Rating based on how great it is for it's low price.  I've only had this TV for one day, but I love it so far.  I will continue to update this review as I use the TV more and learn more about it.=========================ONE MONTH UPDATE (12/26/2012):So I've had this TV for about a month now, and I still love it.  I am very happy with the video performance and I have continued to refine the audio settings.  The picture is great.  The viewing angles are great.  I haven't had a single instance of any kind of motion blur from any fast motion scenes yet.  No change in the very minor backlight bleed which I still think is no big deal.  Its working great with the Verizon FIOS HD DVR and the HD Media Player (now upgraded to a Boxee Box).The one negative regarding this TV is the sound.  I posted a customer image and talked about my manual Equalizer settings in my original review.  Since then, I had found that those setting were still not quite right.  During many scenes, the background music seemed to overpower everything and voices were becoming impossible to understand in many instances.  I kept tinkering with the Equalizer and finally settled on updated settings.  It seems that the 300Hz setting was the one that was controlling most of the background music, so I dropped it way down and words became much clearer.  I have now been using these updated Equalizer settings for a couple of weeks now without messing with them, so that tells me that they sound pretty good to my ears.  Again, for the low price of this TV, I'm not expecting the best sound, so it hasn't had any impact to my 5 Star Rating now that I have fine tuned the settings.  Attached is a link to the customer image of my updated Equalizer settings in case you want to try them.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo3HFIDARBG6VZT/B0078LSTWU/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkLong story short, I still highly recommend this TV for the price.  It seems to hover around the $250-$300 mark and it is a great deal at that price point.=========================FOUR MONTH UPDATE (03/28/2013):Just a quick update.  This TV is still performing great.  It works great with our Verizon FIOS HD DVR and our Boxee Box Media Player.  We love the picture.  We have still never seen any motion blur.  We have not messed with the sound settings in months so the sound is pretty good with the settings I mentioned above.  Still no concerns about backlight bleed or any other quality issues.  Overall, this TV is great.  I love it.  It makes me want to buy a new Samsung TV for my living room.=========================ELEVEN MONTH UPDATE (11/03/2013):Just another quick update since we are coming up to the Black Friday/Christmas Sale time frame.  The TV is still going strong.  The picture still looks great and the sound is still good enough for a bedroom TV.  I haven't seen any mechanical problems with the TV at all after using it for almost a year and I still have a 4 Year SquareTrade Warranty (only $35 at the time of this update) in case something does come up.  This is still a great TV for the price.  After 11 months, we are still extremely happy with our purchase.  Still Highly Recommended!", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV for the price!", "Author": "BB", "ReviewID": "R3J5WRVLL6TK9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really sweet Samsung HDTV for the price. The first one I bought at Walmart for $298 was on Sept. 4th. That one had some LED backlight bleed on the bottom center of it. Like a white cloud around 4 or 5 inches long. So I took it back and returned it and went to another Walmart to purchase another one. No noticeable backlight bleed on this one.I remember reading that there is no noticeable difference between a 1080P vs. 720P with HDTV's under 40\". I found this to be true with a 32\" HDTV. It honestly looks like a 1080P HDTV. So save your money unless you want a SMART 32\" HDTV.I always grew up being a Sony fan. But Samsung has the best picture quality on the market today. You can see that when you checkout the displays at the stores. Was first considering a Vizio, but they are hit and miss with the user reviews. To me it was worth paying an extra $60 for a Samsung that gets much more consistent good user reviews.The blacks are a deep black and the colors are truly brilliant. The sound is very good on it. No need to hook-up external speakers to it. Love the thin bezel on it as well. I use this 32\" for my medium size bedroom. Bigger is better, but anything bigger than this would be overwhelming.I would recommend doing what I did and go with SquareTrade on the warranty. They advertize a 3 year parts and labor warranty for $33. Make sure you call them instead of doing it online. When I called the Rep he offered me a 4 year warranty for $3 more. You can't beat a $36 4 year warranty. And SquareTrade has great user reviews.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent T.V for the price minor compromises", "Author": "J. Carvajal \"jay105\"", "ReviewID": "RT7H0HV56VS83", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I bought this T.V (Sorry not in amazon) I read carefully the reviews not only in here but in Cnet, Tiger Direct. Etc. The first thing that came to mind was the \"compromises\" of this T.V; the fact that there is no audio outputs and the \"dreadful\" bad sound.With that said I bought it. I went to a store an saw it in display first. From all the brands displayed (yes including Sony) at least in the store I went this T.V had the clearest picture. I went ahead I check out with the sales guy help the settings. For my astonishment  all were standard, I mean the way that the thing came directly from the factory out of the box. I have to say that I sincerely did not see too much of appreciable difference between this one and the 1080p. (except for the price $100 more) and one or more ports.I asked the sales person who was very accommodating and knowledgeable for some advice.  He asked me what would be  the main purpose for this T.V?  I said Watch T.V in the bedroom. Then he asked what kind of T.V service (Cable/satellite/antenna) do you have? TWC. It results that my cable box Higher native High Def resolution is 720p any way. Your T.V picture would be as Good as the native signal that comes from the box , antenna or DVD so for my main purpose (watch T.V in the bedroom) it does not matter if I paid $100 more for the 1080p or $100 less for the 720p, the original native signal and quality would be 720p anyway...in the store was impossible to test the  quality of sound for obvious reasons. Because the constant complaints in here I have a very low expectations. I found the sound to be similar to any other T.V's of this size (all come with small speakers). I played a little bit with it and I set the audio to \"clearer voice\" in the EQ. at half high of the volume the T.V works as any other T.V's even the more expensive ones. (I have Vizios, Samsung and Sony) but again I watch this T.V in the bedroom where is usually quieter.Some other complains where that all the connections are in the back. I bet that if all the connections were located in the front/side people will complain anyway. I rather have it in the back where you can't see all the clutter. There are only two HDMI's connections. If I want to hook up my computer on it My new computer has a HDMI port like all the new stuff do so not biggie for me. i rather have just one a multipurpose cable than all the clutter with RCA's, optical, etc, etc.T.V is very light. installation can't be any easier as well as navigating from the menu but I had another Samsung TV which could make it easier in my case. (not learning curve)Some people also complain that this is not the thinnest T.V either well unless you are going to set it in a razor thin wall the difference between 3.5\" and 1.5\" in back space is meaningless. the deep unless you have serious space problems is useless the wide distance is in the back and you are looking at the screen from the front so who cares? I understand the difference with old TV's and the bulky back side. Having 3.5\" against 1.5\" for more $100?  give me the cheaper 3.5\" and $100 back in my bank account.Tried different angles and the viewing was good or excellent in almost all. Samsung for some reason have this idea to have a light in their T.V's front side when they are off. this one has a little red light that does not bother me at all. Other Samsung TV I have has a giant blue light that it is annoying if you have the T.V in the bedroom. why they add this lights is a mystery to me you know when the T.V is off and On, has image TV ON, Not image TV is OFF, as simple as that.Because i am not using any external sources of sound and care too much about that in the bedroom I did not care as much about the lack of outputs for headsets or even speakers like some people in these reviews seem to care so much but if you do it is something to consider. This is the best TV for the price TV for these usages:1. Bedroom T.V / Kids room.2. Kitchen T.V3. To be used as a monitor if your computer HAS a HDMI connection4. if you use your TV at a regular volume and don't care about external sources of sound.(Speakers, headsets, sound bars).5. You have a cable box or signal source which native resolution is 720p if you pay the extra for the 1080p the T.V image wont be any better unless you watch blue rays in a blue Ray capable DVD (Timer Warner boxes for instance have a native resolution of 720p).6. You don't want to break the Bank to have a good quality T.V mostly for regular T.V viewing.7. Want a flat panel too replace that old bulky TV a flat panel that is it not as thin as a sheet of paper but thinner than old TV's you want to replacement (My case).8. Don't mind that the ports are in the back (Again except for some TV's where the ports are on the side you usually get them in the back)In summary;Excellent price, better than average image (I would say excellent picture), capable but not great sound, thin, light and easy to set up. That's a winner in my book.UPDATE : 06/29/2013For those concerned about other sources of audio. If you use either a satellite receiver or a cable box you can use the audio out jacks on either of those. That's what I did to test a new audio bar. It worked!!! so the T.V itself does not have to have audio jacks \"IF\" you use any of those boxes as a source for signal.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sure is purdy, but not paying much for it shows.", "Author": "N", "ReviewID": "R23XMAKRUV0YI1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In a nutshell:  Good, sexy, small TV marred by crap refresh rate.  Good for movies, not so for actions or games.What it is:  a basic 32-inch TV by Samsung.  Backlit LED TV with relatively low resolution (1366x768, I believe?) and low refresh rate.  No Smart TV feature, although supposedly you could play some limited formats of videos via USB.How it is:  Nice and clear screen with good color reproduction.  Intuitive, if cluttered, remote.  All ports are at the back, and component and composite port are one and the same, befitting its budget ambitions.  Only two HDMI ports, which may not matter much if just using as some ersatz computer monitor (hey, HTPC!) or a bedroom TV (...Roku?).  Also missing due to budget constraints:  smart TV functions--you ain't watching that Netflix of yours unless you get an HTPC or a settop box.  You aren't probably going to miss the extra pixels, but you are going to miss the higher refresh rate--motion blur is rather pronounced on this TV.  Movies, being shot at 30FPS, however, work better than, say, sports or games.  LED cuts down on power cost, resulting in one of the most efficient TV of its size.  It's not sidelit or direct-lit, though, so it's not particularly going to be thin depth-wise (it does have a thin bezel compared to other TVs of this size) nor would it have fancy features like local dimming.  It, however, doesn't seem to have light bleeds or uneven light splotches.  It doesn't come with any accessories other than the stand (duh) and the remote (also duh); if you need any composite, coax, or HDMI cables, you should order them with this TV.  Strange toggle button under the TV works both as power button and channel/volume control, which makes this TV very disorienting to use without remote.  Game mode cuts down on refresh rate somewhat, but doesn't seem to be working on HDMI.  If you want to hook up external speakers to this TV, good luck--it doesn't have any coax or optical outs for sound hook-ups to them, although some soundbars with HDMI inputs might work.  Thankfully, in-unit speakers are decent enough.Pros:  Sexy slim bezels; LED backlights; two HDMI inputs; energy efficient; nice colors; remote intuitive; loud and clear sound; solid build quality; backlight is evenly lit.Cons:  all inputs are at the back; no VGA input; no smart TV features; motion blur from low refresh rate; questionable stand strength; TV isn't very thin; weird control on TV; remote cluttered; game mode doesn't seem to work on HDMI; no conventional sound out means you can't let the sound out to some home theater system speakers or soundbars.Verdict:  Good, solid TV for the price ($248 at the time of purchase).  Try to go bigger if you're in the market for a good TV that you can game on; there just aren't any affordable 120Hz 32\" TVs.Edit (11/22/2012):  The TV does not have any audio out, which may hinder your use of the computer with your home theater system (...with a 32 inch TV? Really?) or your soundbar.  Reflected in review.Edit (1/13/2013):  The TV can do game mode over HDMI; my mistake.  Also, according to a major A/V retailer website, the TV doesn't push audio out to the HDMI-compatible soundbars.

Miller", "ReviewID": "R32TDW30TRKUOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm always puzzled by reviews that complain about stated features of products.  In this case, I have read several reviews by people that complain that this Samsung TV is not a Slim model.  Apparently some people rely only on pictures and not on detailed descriptions of things like Specifications, or Product Measurements.Being a reasonable person, I was able to successfully determine the TV's measurements - it helped that they were obviously stated in the product description.  Having determined (prior to my purchase) that these dimensions would fit my requirements, I purchased the TV on Amazon during a Samsung Black Friday promotion in 2012 for about $50 less than the typical Amazon price.I should point out that, contrary to another reviewer's statement, this TV is indeed VESA compatible for wall mounts.  I had no problem attaching the TV to a Cheetah mount (also purchased on Amazon).  In this case, the Amazon description was not clear what the mounting options were, so I was forced to (gasp!) visit the Samsung web site.  A quick search on the model number and I was able to download the manual and review the detailed specs, including mounting hole measurements.This TV fits perfectly in the corner, and it is very light weight so it puts very little strain on the wall mount.  Even though the design is not a slim style, I found that the shape of the bezel allows it to fit perfectly in the corner, with both edges of the TV right up against the wall.  If it were to be mounted against a flat wall rather than a corner, it would stick out a little further.Be sure to register the TV on the Samsung website, as you will get an extra 3 months or warranty support for free.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "I wish I hadn't bought them please look at posted pictures of repair condtion from Samsung", "Author": "D.

Picture quality is just so so, kind of washed out, not bright.Sound works, all I can say.Inputs are limited, very much on component or composite, you can use one at a time connected. 2-HDMI on the rear kind of limits it as well, could have added a side HDMI for quick connects.Forget any outputs, audio, etc.Well I wasn't thrilled with them and almost returned them. After a little of 5-months one will not power on. It is an internal failure.I guess you get what you pay for. I have to pay to ship this TV 500 miles for repair. What? It is a 32 inch class, not a pocket watch. I am almost ready to junk it and tell Samsung Nation will they can go. Warranty says owner will be responsible for shipping 27 inch and below, in home service for 37 inch and above. Based on the warranty a 32 inch should be there expense, either in home or they pay the shipping. It doesn't say specifically either way. It is not a 27 inch, so I don't pay, it isn't a 37 inch, so no in home. I say they should pay, since Samsung used to always do in home for over 30 inch TV sets.It is what it is, not much else. This has cost them additinal sales, i.e two new cellphones being returned. I was getting ready to buy a plasma, for the living room, now I'm running away from Samsung. My daughter wanted a Samsung tablet, she is getting a Toshiba, get the point.Update #1Well I need to drop this to a zero star, the second of three has failed with same no power issue as the other one, this is less than five months of service. This is less than two weeks apart, not a good warm and fuzzy on these or other Samsung products now.Do I think these are going last much past a year or even make it to a year. I'm now out over $100.00 for shipping and packing, two 32 inch LED TV's. Not a bit happy with there products. What else can I say, pure junk, designed to make it ay ear if lucky.You can expect yours to likely fail after the warranty disappears.Update #2I am just updating, the first came back from the Samsung Certified repair center, with a loose power button, missing bezel screws and not properly assembled. I have to say Samsung is not a first rate or even second rate company. I would have to rate them below Coby in quality and Samsung service doesn't even deserve a rating as it basically doesn't exist, a total joke and run around from beginning to end.This is the worst customer experience I have ever had with any company.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sound is not good", "Author": "D.

When I asked the Amazon customer service for the Samsung contact info, she told me to google it because her internet was slow (Internet slow at Amazon? How ironic).Dealing with Samsung wasn't any better. I was told I would need to ship the TV to New Jersey so it can be serviced and it would be a couple of weeks. I live on the west coast in a city of 500,000 and Samsung had no local service affiliate. I had to request a free return UPS shipping label, which had to go up through management to get approved. Had I not I would have been stuck with my own shipping costs, but I would need to pack the item as \"fragile\" to the tune of $45 at the UPS store. One hour on the phone, no TV for at least two weeks and $45 later I gave up. I'll live with the black streaks in the TV.My advice: purchase items like this from a local store.

I have this TV as well as another Samsung in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful.  The only drawback with this TV it's not a smart TV and you would need to use a WiFi router like Google TV or Roku to get it to connect to the internet.  This is why I gave this TV 4 stars instead of 5.  But if this is not an issue than this TV would be a smart purchase.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step when looking for TV's is what features come with it.  I have listed a few for you here:- This Samsung comes with a technology called Clear Motion Rate (CMR).  CMR can depict fast-moving images with sharp detail and vivid contrast while eliminating image distortion.- This TV also comes with Wide Color Enhancer Plus (WCEP).  WCEP allows you to witness the entire RGB spectrum on your screen to bring.- The final feature that I thought was a good add-on that comes with this TV is ConnectShare.  ConnectShare lets you watch videos, play music, or view photos from a USB connection without needing to use a PC or special equipment. Simply plug your USB device or drive directly into your Samsung TV's USB port and watch on the big screen with friends and family (Here is how you could get around user wireless router for this TV).  You can put movies or other content onto a thumbdrive you push it on to the TV directly.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice 32 inch unit", "Author": "tree farmer", "ReviewID": "R2LNWYUC7XINR0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "bought for the master bedroom, performs great.

I've researched the manual and spent 45 minutes online with an equally surprised tech when he read through it with me and confirmed it is not possible. period.The outputs are for dvd only. Don't be fooled by the pictures.If the sound ever goes out on this lovely tv, you're screwed. So again, in my opinion, this is a relevant review.For those who will still think...\"no-way!\" read this excerpt from the online manual:\"Although your TV may have RCA or 3.5mm (1/4') audio outputs and you can physically connect speakers directly to these connections they are not meant to be used this way. \"", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Surprised how good it is!", "Author": "Jim-100", "ReviewID": "R35PKTK1YEOLIA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm using this TV in a guest bedroom and although I have a cable service with cable boxes in other rooms I decided to first try this set by connecting it directly with the coax cable before getting yet another cable box.  Coax generally provides the poorest picture (except maybe the antenna input) but was I ever surprised that it found 116 stations after auto tuning, many of which are HD.  They look exceptionally good and with a 32\" screen the 720P on the HD channels looks as good as larger TVs with 1080P.  The sound is good and can be tailored to individual tastes with different settings, including an equalizer.When I viewed this TV in a store its picture was noticeably better than most of the other 32\" models.  The picture is crisp and beautiful with great color and contrast and I'm extremely happy with it.

Shell", "ReviewID": "R3T1JVV9RBT3DC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A few years ago, my first HDTV was a Samsung 22\" LCD TV (model: LN22A450). It served me fairly well, but still felt a bit too small for its room. Since then, I've kept my eye on 32\" TVs but never found the price and quality to line up just right to replace what was still a perfectly good TV, until I came across this Samsung 32EH4003. I first noticed it in the time leading up to \"Black Friday\" sales for 2012, and then noticed that The Wirecutter had labeled it as the \"Best Small TV\". Taking advantage of some good pricing and confidence in the reviews, I decided it was time to move my 22\" TV to the bedroom and buy this as my main TV.It's mostly great. The LED backlighting is solid across the whole set and the viewing angles are significantly improved over the 22A450. It is true 16:9, which the 22A450 was not. This was noticeable on the smaller TV when viewing channels like ESPN or CNBC where just a bit of the sidebar content would be missing. On this TV, it's all there without needing to letterbox. The built in speakers seem pretty good, better than I expected, which has turned out to be important for my setup. The input support is a little lax: it only has two HDMI ports (which is a step up from my previous TV which only had one) and one component input. A third HDMI port would be nice. The smaller TV this is replacing had more input variety (separate composite input, PC (DVI?) input) but some of those options are less needed now.The one feature that my previous, smaller Samsung TV had that this does not, which surprised me, was support for stereo audio out. On the other TV, I just had the TV wired up to my amp (no multichannel), and it played whatever input was being used: built in tuner, blu-ray player, cable box: I could get their audio into my amp.This TV does NOT support that feature. I don't know how common of a feature audio-out is in modern TVs, but this was something that I had and used in my previous TV that is just not in this one. I might not have bought this TV knowing that. However, the built-in speakers seem pretty good so far and I have not needed my amp (I live in a loft apartment and don't need loud TV, as I have neighbors, I just needed something a bit louder and more clear than the speakers in the smaller TV).Overall, I'm pleased with this TV. The picture is great, the size is great for my environment, PS3 games and Blu-Rays look great on it. I really like the thin bezel/frame around the screen. The overall unit is not as thin as some LED TV's I've seen, but when looking at the TV straight on or even at some light angles, it looks very thin.

Good picture, decent sound quality, good quality remote, easy menu navigation, and pretty simple setup.The big thing that brings it down is that the stand is really cheap. It's a simple plastic affair held together by a few screws. It seemed pretty wobbly but alright at first, but its problems quickly became apparent. The day after I assembled it, the set was already noticeably sagging forward and tilted slightly to the right, purely from just sitting on the shelf. I now have it supported by a thick book so it's less obvious and (hopefully) no longer degrading, but the fact that that's even necessary, especially after only a day, is ridiculous. I'll have to either mod the stand so that it provides better support or resort to a wall mount. I strongly suspect that, if left unmitigated, the weight of the set and the wobbling that happens any time you touch or step near the set would do serious damage to or outright break the stand within a few months, potentially resulting in damage to the set itself. To allow these units to ship with such a clearly inadequate stand is irresponsible.The set has two HDMI inputs, but only one set of ports for component video input, so don't expect to hook much up to it. That said, this is a relatively modest set anyway at only 32 inches, so it's no great surprise. It still would have been nice to at least have one more component input, though, so I still docked its score a tad for that.Another problem that I had was that the speakers were in the back of the set. This is not unusual, but since it's replacing an old CRT set with forward-facing speakers in a TV cabinet, this resulted in an unfortunate \"cavernous\" effect on the sound. This is, of course, a very situational complaint, but something I thought I'd mention since it didn't occur to me and it might help others avoid this issue.One final note: the set doesn't have traditional buttons for power, volume, etc. It's all controlled by a single low-profile joystick on the bottom of the set.

Would have liked to have gone bigger, but limited to 32 inch due to width of space.The first thing I noticed was how light this was and how much of a pleasure it is to move around.  Compared to the 200lb TV that we had to lug up a flight of stairs, this thing was a feather.  It is very easy to move to keep dust build-up around it minimal.Attaching the base was very simple and there have been no problems with leaning to one side or another.  It is a matter of tightening the four screws.In the back are inputs for component (red, white, and yellow RCA plugs), composite(red,blue,and green plugs), 2 HDMI, a USB port, and Coax (think cable that you screw on.)  There is NO audio output, so if you do not want to use the built-in speakers, you will need an A/V receiver.After hooking up the HDMI to the cable box, I turned it on and was disappointed in the picture.  Sure, it was better than the old tube, but it looked washed out and just okay.  Switching among the default settings did not do much to improve it and I began to wonder if I made a mistake.I gathered a bunch of calibration pictures and put them on a USB memory stick.  I also used the THX optimization feature from one of the DVD's around the house.

I went from being \"it is okay,\" to this is pretty amazing.  It takes a bit of tweaking, but it can produce a high quality picture.  HDMI will always give the highest quality, but it can still be good using Component.  I also tried the coaxial connection, but would not recommend it if you can avoid it. The picture looked blurry to me and worse than the old tube TV.The speakers are just okay. If it was just me using it, I would be fine.

Its not some amazing extremely expensive TV set, but for just playing some games and watching movies in my bedroom it does its job.  Its price is really amazing, especially since it comes from one of the top TV companies (Samsung).  This was my first HDTV and it is such an improvement over my old SDTV.  One thing that worried me was that when Amazon shipped it, they just shipped the TV in its own box and didn't package in into another box with more cushioning.  I'm not sure if this is standard, but the TV arrived in perfect shape nonetheless.  Maybe by leaving it in its own box, the delivery drivers will know to be more careful with it since they know its a TV or something.  Anyway, I highly recommend this TV if you plan to use it in a bedroom or if you can't afford larger TVs you can use this in your living room too.

I cant tell that 1080 is better, we have it on other tvs. The kicker is that there is no rca or headphone output.  The only way to add better audio is to buy a home theater system that accepts HDMI.  Most soundbars do not. I looked at soundbars and small home theater systems, but even the small systems take up too much space, with five speakers and a receiver. You can wall mount the speakers, etc. but I want something easy like speakers you plug in.  I connected a wifi bluray and it plays audio through its rca audio out IF you are watching bluray or wifi streams Iike Netflix.  There does not seem to be a way to switch from tv speakers to sound system unless you connect an hdmi sound system which runs around $230 and up.  If I had known about the lack of audio outputs I would have bought a different tv. I ordered an HDMI to rca/3.5mm converter for $28 and hope it works. It will be analog not digital.

The 4000 is almost identical to the newer 4003, but it has a digital optical out and external speaker support. This newer 4003 TV does NOT have that outlet nor external speaker support software. The picture is excellent, but the sound quality is mediocre (not as good as the sound on those old-fashioned boxy TVs), so connecting a receiver system with speakers via the digital optical outlet is necessary if you want good sound quality.Here's the specs for the 4000:2 HDMI inputs2 USB ports1 set of component analog inputs1 Digital Audio Video Out (digital optical output)Its software also has more features than the 4003, such as settings for external speakers.Here's the specs for the 4003:2 HDMI inputs1 USB port1 set of component analog inputsAs you can see, the 4003 doesn't have any outputs whatsoever, so if you get it you are stuck with its built-in speakers, but the 4000 has 1 digital optical output (you need a special optical cable like this to connect to that output; can also get a digital-to-analog converter such as this). With the inputs (which are labelled on the TV as \"HDMI IN,\" \"A/V IN,\" etc.), you can connect things like DVD players, game systems, and cable/satellite boxes to the TV. However, to connect receivers/amps for external speakers, you need the little holes that are labelled \"OUT.\" I honestly don't know why Samsung discontinued the 4000 in favor of the 4003, but you can still buy the 4000 as used or refurbished on Amazon. After getting a brand-new 4003 from Wal-Mart, I returned it for a refund and ordered a refurbished 4000 through Amazon for $280 (plus $40 shipping). It's more expensive than the 4003, but it's worth it. Unfortunately, neither product has any composite outputs (only inputs) like old TVs do, but I haven't been able to find any new HDTVs that have those anyway.

People will claim that the image isn't sharp since it is 720p or 60hz but I can say those people are wrong. For one, if your sitting over 6ft from your tv, most people will not be able to tell the difference between 720p or 1080p. Also, the human eye physically cant see over approximately 70hz so don't buy the hog wash that you need a tv that is 120hz. It's the same type of hog wash where people say you need a $80 HDMI cable to get a quality picture. The regular $5 HDMI cables do the job just fine. This is a barebones non smart tv but for the price I would recommend. The only reason I took 1 star off is because of the construction of the TV.

I've adjusted the screen and audio settings to get the maximum performance out of this TV.  My review is based on this.The screen quality gets 3/5 stars.  It is a bit too contrasty, and blows out the whites unless drastically adjusted.  Also, there are major color shifts when you view the screen even slightly off angle.  The screen shifts into much cooler tones the more you view the screen at an off-angle.  High-speed scenes are blurry.  The Clear Motion Rate 60 does little to improve this.The audio gets 1/5 stars out of the box.  It is truly horrible.  Even after spending considerable time adjusting the EQ, it doesn't get any better than 1.5/5 stars.  The audio sounds like it's coming out of 1-inch speakers.  The sound is very tinny, with no richness at all.  There is no bass whatsoever.  Voices are difficult to discern at times of intense music/sound effects.The stand is fair quality, but the TV will rock on it at the slightest movement.  The remote is well laid-out, and is the best part of this TV.  Another annoyance tis that there is a bright red LED that is on, when the TV is off???  If you like a dark room at night, this will be an annoyance.Had I the choice again, I definitely would not buy it again.

The reason I returned it was that it used more wattage than advertised.  For the average person, plugged into the grid, this won't amount to much in terms of cost; however, I planned to use it off the grid and wattage is critical for off grid (solar) use.  The reason I give it 4 stars is that I know most people won't care that much about the power consumption, since it is still very good for normal household power.  The advertised wattage by Samsung was 28W, but my testing showed a consistent wattage closer to 40W.  Again, this won't matter to most people unless you are buying it to use on an off grid system.The good points are that I thought it had excellent picture quality and I have had good experience with Samsung products. On the negative side, two HDMI hookups would be fine for me, but some people might want 3 or more, which could be a consideration. Also, the sound was a little \"tinny\" but I didn't attempt to adjust any settings on the sound, so I would check other reviews for opinions on that.  The set was very lightweight, although I prefer the thinner design of many LED sets, which this one does not have.

Went into the youtube app to just check how it looked and when the screen went black with the YT logo dread hit me... I thought \"Oh man...no way!\" Right in the center of the screen at the top was severe backlight bleed.(Which is odd considering this is supposed to be a full-array??) And the rest of the screen in black didn't look right. My next words were \"Crap..now I gotta return it..\"  My brother didn't notice it much and said it's not a big deal. But to me it's unacceptable. To make sure it was the panel, I booted up Zombi U. Yup. Same problem.*SIGH*I'm incredibly disappointed right now.I may or may not return it for a replacement and hope it doesn't happen again.If I do, I will update the review.EDIT: This review will not get updated as Amazon is now out of stock and i'm SOL. All I get is a refund and there is NO WHERE I can get the same set for the the same price @247.99$.Edit2: 12/05/12.To the TV's defense, it was probably just luck that I ended up with a bad unit. And before I noticed the bleeding, in a normal bright room settings with bright material it looked great uncalibrated. And i'm sure it still looks great on a non bad unit in dark scenes. So I wouldn't take this review as a complete guideline. But rather just my experience with the one set that I had gotten.

The picture was always great, it was a nice size for my room, and it was a nice price. BUT, I cannot stand the quality of audio HD TV's give off. They don't have speakers anything like boxy tv's have. So one quick way to fix that is just to get speakers for it right? WRONG. I had to figure that one out the hard way. I had computer speakers that I hooked up to my old emerson HD TV that just plug into a 3.5 mm jack (headphone jack), but the TV didn't have one. I thought ok I'll just get a home theater system then. So my girlfriend bought me a RCA home theater system with an optical cable and HDMI cord for Christmas and it still didn't work after I messed around with all the settings for 3 days and could not get it to work. So I took the system back for a phillips sound bar because I figured how could I mess that up. Well I messed around with it again for like 2 days and could not get that to work either. At this point I was thinking what gives and I looked up a ton of reviews on this TV on here and could not find anyone ever talking about the audio until I saw one review saying you couldn't hook up any external speakers to it. I don't just believe everything I see so I went on samsung's live chat system and asked them if it was true. Turns out the Samsung 32 inch 720p TV has NO AUDIO OUT PORTS on it. So I just took it back and I'm getting another emerson.This TV is great visually so if you don't care about the sound, then this is the TV for you.

The picture quality is fantastic, BUT...  We were angry when we discovered this television has NO 1/8 or 1/4 audio output jack to which to connect our (very nice) computer speakers.  Who makes a television with no headphone audio out?  EVERY other electronic item on the market has an audio out - iPods, iPads, Android phones, tablets... but apparently if you're buying a flatscreen TV, you're expected to have a 7-speaker system hooked up to a receiver.  Or you don't mind terrible built-in speakers.  Seriously, they're awful.  The sound is thin, lifeless, and tinny.That said, we've been making it work by connecting this TV to my MacBook Pro and using it as a monitor, which works like a dream, and then connecting our computer speakers to the MBP.  It works great, although it's a little unwieldy.  But... This Christmas we received a Blu-Ray player (awesome!), but we don't want to hook it up to this television because the built-in speakers in this TV leave much to be desired (like depth, bass, and texture).  And there's no way to connect our existing speaker system to the TV or the Blu-Ray player.  So, less than a year after buying this TV, we're looking at different TVs because this one just doesn't work with our humble entertainment system (without either a lot of jerry-rigging or buying EVEN MORE components).

Two weeks now I think. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money on this because I read reviews about it not being good for gaming, not having the best picture, and not having good sound.First off, the sound is perfect for me since I use the TV in my small/medium bedroom. It gets pretty loud. There's a surround sound feature on the TV, so when I was watching a movie, a phone was ringing. I thought the phone was ringing in the next room in MY house, but it was actually part of the movie. There's also audio outputs, so if you wanted to have surround sound speakers, that'd work too. Personally, I soon plan to buy some Pulse Elite headphones (I use nothing but a PS3 on my TV), so that'll satisfy my surround sound needs.SPEAKING OF THE PS3. It looks AMAZING on this TV. I play mostly Call Of Duty: MW3 on there, and it looked great. There's no lag between pressing a button and it happening on the screen. Don't judge me, but I was quick scoping like it wasn't nothing. It's also almost like I can even see farther away while sniping than I could on my old tube TV. I tested other games out on it like Naruto Storm, Little Big Planet, Saints Row, and others, and it all looked just freaking great. I can't wait to get Grand Theft Auto V and play it on this, Oh, btw I have my PS3 into my TV using an HDMI cord. Idk how regular AV cords would look.The screen is really great. When I playing a game, I'm either sitting on the edge of my bed which is 4 feet from the screen, or I'm sitting across the room which is typically 11-12 feet from the screen. Then again, I can adjust the TV distance and position since I have it mounted on my wall using the VideoSecu wall mount I also purchased from Amazon.Another cool feature this TV has is that it can take a USB through the back. I hooked up my Android phone through USB to the TV and started playing music on it. It's awesome. I doubt I'm going to be using my TV to play music from my phone, but hey, still a pretty neat feature.Delivery was swift. Tip: Order this using Amazon Prime. When you order it, make sure you do it early in the morning. Even though I chose Two Day Shipping with Prime, I got the TV the NEXT DAY. I was surprised. The delivery man also delivered it properly. If you get your TV and it's delivered face down, or back down, just return automatically. That's how \"black lines\" develop on your TV. As your opening your TV, make sure you don't put it face down or back down either. Keep it standing and you should be good.I've only had this TV for less than 2 weeks, I use it maybe everyday or every two days, but I really feel like it's going to last. I'd definitely recommend this to someone.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a Samsung", "Author": "Isaac Abouganem", "ReviewID": "RQ77E3VRZV0LG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this TV.

It's just when you set it up you can't just push the base in all the way. It stays out a little so the bottom two screws can get in properly. I use Movie Mode on the TV and it brings a great picture.

He explained that this was a panel problem and can't be fixed.  I read a few similar experiences in Amazon customer reviews for this TV and other Samsung TVs; one person said their TV had a white line down the screen, so they exchanged it for another set of the same model and the second one was OK.  Another person said that many of the Samsung TVs actually don't have Samsung panels, they have cheaper panels.  This probably wasn't due to a cheaper panel since the picture was beautiful; the tech explained that the box was probably dropped at the shipping warehouse, and these new TVs are so fragile, this kind of thing can happen even though there is no visible damage to the outside of the set.

I first looked at the 26'' model but this 32'' caught my eye and I figured for only about $30 more for 6 more inches I should consider this model.I tested the television the moment it arrived and could immediately tell I had purchased a high quality product. For anyone who moves around a lot or is in school and not looking for a huge set (say 40'' or higher) then this is an ideal television. It is surprisingly lightweight. Unfortunately, as stated by many people, this television does not have good quality sound which is definitely emphasized when going from using my dad's 40'' Sansui which has much better sound quality. For me this wasn't a deal breaker but is important to note for others. No complaints on the picture quality so far. To me, it is superb and more than I could have wished for this low price! I am not a videophile by any means so you might want to look at other reviews that go more in depth on the subject of this television's picture quality.**EDIT: One more important thing to note is that in addition to the subpar sound quality the television also does not come with any audio output components immediately available with the television. Granted, there seems to be other means of achieving audio output other than the internal sound system of the television but you would have to consult other reviewers more knowledgeable on this subject. Just thought it may be important for others to know this. Again, not a deal breaker for me at all. Still an amazing bargain.Overall, this was a great choice!

I usually go by the 'If it's not broke- don't fix it' mentality, but in this case I decided the time was right for an upgrade.  I must admit I was a little skeptical about how good the picture could be, but WOW!  I'm not a 'tv snob' by any means(remember, i JUST made the switch from a CRT) so I didn't know what to expect.  Everything now looks so REAL!  Don't worry about the specs only being 720p and 60Hz- on a tv this size it really doesn't matter.Yes, I 'showcased' this model at my local electronics superstore to compare the picture/sound next to comparable models before I bought it here on Amazon and I recommend anyone in the market for one do the same.  *start rant- I don't understand why brick-and-mortar stores get so upset about this!  I'm physically IN their business- i've taken the hardest part of selling out of the equation! - end rant*  Next to the other name brands there was no comparison.  I also appreciated seeing the Energy Guide stickers on all the models.  This particular Samsung is very energy-efficient compared to the others in it's size range(it's more on par with the power-consumption of 19-26 inch tvs).As everyone has noted - the sound is nothing to write home about.  My old CRTs had big, front-facing speakers that would rock the room!  With the thinner profile these new HDTVs come with the speakers have to face down and can't be very big.  I knew this when I tested this unit in person and honestly for the size room(bedroom) I'm putting it in it doesn't matter.  I just turn the audio up and all is well(for me anyways)!  Some reviewers have mentioned adjusting the bass, etc. and that will probably help, but again I don't really have a huge problem with it.  The lack of audio-out options could be a deal-breaker for the 'home theater' buffs.Overall, I'm really enjoying my new tv.  I'm picking-up the over-the-air digital signal(free) and watching movies with a newer Sony DVD player that has upgrading? and HDMI output(see my other review there).

For the price I am very satisfied with the tv. People who complain about the sound ... really?  You're going to complain about the sound coming out of a 32\" lcd-led tv?  What did you expect, 7.1 channel surround coming out of this thing??  The sound on this Samsung is very acceptable and gets PLENTY loud on my OTA channels and Roku.  I use this as a bedroom tv and have found the picture crisp and sound very nice.  I have found myself using the sleep mode on a regular basis.  I do not use this for gaming so I cannot speak to that.The tv also has a beautifully minimalist style bezel.  The black bezel is thin and unobtrusive and would look good in any room.If you want a tv from a brand synonymous with quality then this Samsung 32\" lcd-led is a very good choice.  Bright, crisp picture with very acceptable audio.I liked this tv so much that I also bought one for my (technologically-challenged) parents.  Their experience has been great thus far.UPDATE 3/07/14: Less than 1.5 years after purchase, this TV has developed dark lines that make it almost unusable.  Although the tv is now out of warranty, it is my sincere hope that Samsung does the right thing and fixes or replaces the TV.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great 32\" TV!", "Author": "J.

Leard", "ReviewID": "R35FM3AB90V676", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on a great sale from Dell after reading reviews of similar models online. I didn't need much from it; just adequate sound (didn't need to excel here) and a fairly uniform level of brightness across the TV. After screwing the base and backing on, I immediately noticed that the upper left hand corner of the screen was brighter than the rest on a black background, and this extended to dark scenes on TV. On bright scenes, it seemed a bit darker than the rest. I was none too pleased by this, as this kind of non-uniformity is what I expect from an old TV, not a new one. It's unfortunate, because the rest of the screen did have very good color, and it was far more vibrant and realistic than the TV I was hoping to replace. If this was the only issue, I would have considered an exchange for a different unit of the same model.The sound, however, is the real kicker. It sounds TERRIBLE, as if you were listening through a tin can with a string going to the TV. The unit does support some customization of sound levels, but it does very little to improve the TV; at its best, it sounds just bad, and out of the box it's shockingly terrible. To make things worse, it has no audio out. So while I can use speakers, I have to run the the sound from the source to the speaker or to a switch directly, instead of letting the TV output this like every TV I've ever owned previously.This TV does have a low price point, and you can't expect the world, but I do expect a certain level of competence. When the background is dark, I don't want lighter areas popping up, distracting me from what I'm watching, and I certainly expect sound to be better than what my phone outputs through its own speaker. If your model doesn't experience the screen uniformity issues and you are comfortable running the audio right past the TV, you might be satisfied, but even at such a low cost this TV is no value. Dell even offered me $30 in credit to keep it (which was bringing my actual cost near $100), but I refused.

It was easy to do. Mine does not wobble or tilt.  I am glad I went and checked it out.  I am so happy with this tv.  And Samsung has wonderful tech support for their products.  The guy at Samsung told me they give tech support for the life of any of their products; contact them to see if that is still true.

The TVs are to be used by an elderly, home-bound lady in her bedroom and living room, and I think they will suit her nicely.  She has two identical TVs so that she can use whichever remote she finds handy for either TV.

Samsung's have the best picture quality hands down at every price point.  This model is a budget model, and I want to mention a couple of things about this TV that I was bummed about.First, you can't connect a HDD to the USB input.  That means you can't connect that 3TB hard drive full of movies you have directly to this TV.  The USB input also does not read .ISO files (but will read MOST other formats).  The USB input reads audio/video/pictures from 'thumb drives'.And second, there is NO RCA AUDIO OUTPUT.  This means that you will need a receiver with HDMI ins/outs to run the TV's audio to a home theater.SO a couple of missing features for me, but nothing that would make me have buyers remorse for buying this TV.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first flat screen", "Author": "Peter Rozboril", "ReviewID": "R3KSZ7M526P9VW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had it for a few months now and I am very pleased and impressed with it.

I did a lot of research before buying and overall, I am impressed with this television. To provide context, I upgraded to this television from a 32in JVC flat screen HDTV.We use this television in our bedroom. The primary positives for this unit are great picture quality in general, very little noticeable jittering in action sequences (configuration required), and the eco modes that we run in high to dim the television to the lowest light possible for nighttime viewing. We also make use of the screen off function to simply listen sometimes. I also make use of the auto off feature so that the television turns off after 4 hours without input on the remote.This unit isn't without some minor detractions (though some of these are correctable with settings). As most people report, the remote is too crowded. Additionally, the remote's layout is not intuitive to touch (I had a hard time feeling the arrow navigation apart from the menu key). In addition, the sound and picture quality are garbage out of the box. We easily rectified this by setting the sound and display to Movie. I feel like the volume of people reporting this problem indicates that the product should have probably been preconfigured differently.I had seen some notes that the remote was backlit. It, in fact, is not on this model.To fix the motion jitters, turn on LED Motion Plus in the Picture Options menu.

Setting up the stand was simple, once I'd found a screwdriver with a smalll enough head. The 32\" size is very easy to handle but not so light as to seem tippy. Understandng and following written directions for anything electronic is always challenging for the retired English prof who undertook the \"Plug and Play\" feature. Said prof also insists on using only an indoor antenna to \"grab off air\" the limited number of channels, public and commercial, she enjoys. So she dithered between \"Air\" and \"Auto\" for the \"antenna source\", not knowing if the tv understood what she wanted.  It did, though: one of those worked: she doesn't remember which, or if both really did. In any case, the rest of the Plug and Play set-up was a snap for her, and when one of those favorite channels came on, she couldn't have been happier. The picture is beautifully clear and needed only an adjustment in brightness, easily made, to be perfect. The poor challenged prof now intends to read about \"smart antennae\" in the  useful guide provided by Samsung and try to smarten up some more herself.

Additionally, I was surprised how much lighter (at least 15 pounds) this TV is than the older LG.On to the important information... This TV's picture is beautiful!  I cannot over state this.  Samsung LED TV's are simply gorgeous, and this \"lower-end\" model is no different.  It's much better than the older TV and is similar to, or better than, our primary 55\" Samsung LED TV.  Colors are vibrant, whites are bright, and blacks are dark.  Setup out of the box took around 30 minutes--this included screwing the base to the TV and completing the simple, guided on-screen setup.The contested point, and what I was worried about:  the sound.  In my opinion (and more importantly the wife's!), the sound is perfectly fine for a bedroom TV.  And I'm sure it would be OK for a primary TV setup (although a soundbar would be MUCH better).  My only complaint about the sound is that there is little graduation between the low and high volume.  What do I mean?  To me the TV is quiet, and then it is LOUD!

It is a good receiver for picture quality, but I bought it for a bedroom tv, which was a serious mistake.What I LIKE:1.  Good picture, sensitive receiver (I am rural and use an amplified antenna... no satellite or cable used).2.  Will play MP3, MP4, AVI, XVID, MKV files directly via USB.What I dislike:1.  Remote is almost impossible to use in the dark (Important for a bedroom tv)2.  If you press the wrong button you will probably have to start over finding your program, which means if you are watching a DVD or video file (MP4, etc) you will have to select buttons and fast forward to where you goofed up.What I HATE:1.  THERE IS NO OPTION FOR HEADPHONES, EXTERNAL SPEAKERS, AUDIO AMPLIFIER, ETC.  WITHOUT MAJOR, WARRANTY-VOIDING MODIFICATION.  NONE!Explanations and rants:***** This TV has a good 720 pic that at 32-inch screen size is almost the same as 1080p.  I have no complaints at all about that feature and would rate that part of the TV 5 stars.***** You can record a video file on your computer (however you obtained it) and put it on a flash stick or on an SD card plugged into a USB converter stick and easily select and play it in HD on your TV.  Many TV's have a USB input but will not play recorded files.  This is the first low-priced unit that I found that could do it.  Note that some DVD players have a USB input to play files, so if you have a good Samsung DVD player, you can do that on any TV.  We enjoy downloading movies, watching them and then deleting them so that there is not a huge collection of DVDs we never watch a second time.  This is a 5-star feature.*** Sound quality is what you would expect from a 3-inch speaker.  Clear but no bass, tinny sound.*** Remote control is fairly intuitive in daylight, but almost impossible to do more than change channels or volume in the dark.  As a bedroom TV, you might not want one where you have to turn on the lights to fast forward or rewind a disc or file.* There is absolutely NO WAY to listen to this TV other than the tiny speakers built into it.  I knew there was no headphone jack when I bought it, but I thought surely that I could hook up an amplifier and run headphones and speakers through that.  THERE IS NO AUDIO OUTPUT AVAILABLE WHATSOEVER... not even through the USB.  NOTE:  If you have cable or satellite, you will probably be able to connect an amplifier to the set top box furnished by your Dish, DTV or cable company... or from TIVO, etc.All-in-all, this is a great TV for your bedroom if you don't mind the cheap sound, as long as you sleep alone and don't disturb anyone that wants to sleep.  You cannot turn off the sound and use headphones, and you will need to turn on the light sometimes to see the more complex remote buttons.

I didn't have to consult the manual until I wanted to find out how to delete channels; everything else was pretty intuitive.As a chronic channel surfer, I appreciate how legible and well laid-out the remote is. So many remotes have a haphazard layout, with label printing that wears off after a few weeks.I noted that some other reviewers considered the audio to be weak. I haven't found that to be the case, even though I have some hearing loss. Selecting the setting that emphasizes voices over other sounds did the trick for me.If I had a quibble with this set, it would be that the stand doesn't tilt or swivel, but other than that, so far so good.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsungs always work", "Author": "N.

Thought it was a decent price.Bought this for my parents to use in their room, to replace their 20+ year old Zenith 20 inch TV. It was more than time for them to replace it, and I knew they wouldn't get one for themselves.As a college student, the budget for a TV was pretty low at about $300. However, TV's have gotten so cheap since we last bought our \"big\" TV for the house, and I wasn't that worried going into stores.Was going back and forth between this TV, an Insignia, an LG, and a Toshiba. After deliberation, looking at the reviews online, and taking into consideration of the price, the Samsung was the best pick for me. The Insignia, to me, is still kind of an \"off-brand,\" the LG was a little more expensive, and the Toshiba didn't wow me picture wise.Originally looking for a 32\", and it actually ended up being a little big, but its a nice TV. Its better than what I expected for sub-$300. Its one of the \"thicker\" flat panel tv's, but that's no problem as we had a good amount of depth to work with. Not a lot of inputs; 2 HDMI, coaxial cable, and a component input that doubles as an AV port. It has touch buttons on the front, instead of physical buttons.Overall, the picture is pretty nice from what I've seen. My parents don't have HD programming in their room, but from what I saw in the store, it had the best picture compared to the other similar monitors. The box claims the TV has some technology that improves color or something; and it seems to work well. DVD player looks pretty nice as well.Sound is decent, seeing as its a bedroom. Couldn't say much for a larger room, but I'm assuming it would be fine for that too.They don't use the remote, as I programed the DirecTV remote to control it, so can't comment on that.My only complaint with this TV is the stand. It comes with a two part stand. First you've got the base, and then you've got a piece you screw onto it. Then you screw that piece into the bottom of the TV, and you have completed the stand. I know I screwed it in tight and it should be fine, but the stand is definitely wobbly. Checked the screws a few times, still wobbly. Its not in any place where I'm afraid it will fall or get knocked over, its not a huge problem for us. However, the stand is pretty important to the TV, so, I think more detail and care should be put into the design and production of the stand.Really nice TV, and I recommend to anyone that needs a good TV for a bedroom or something.

However, I opted to leave the old TV downstairs and use this one upstairs in the bedroom. Mainly because the audio lacks depth. There's basically no bass to the audio and it's really more so what you might get from a laptop for sound instead of what you would usually expect from a TV. There's also only one component/RCA input. So, unless you have devices that plug in with HDMI (two ports here for those), then you may have problems. My DVD player and Wii both use RCA, so, I would have to switch back and forth on the back of the TV. No thanks.The picture is great. Very nice quality.Yes, as some have said on here, the stand wobbles a bit when you go walking by, but that doesn't really bother me. It's not as bad as it sounds.Overall, it's a great TV for the price, just understand that with the lower price you are not going to get a top of the line TV, but a very good budget alternative.

This TV DOES NOT have any audio outputs, so I am disappointed with that, and removed 1 star (I would have gone 4.5 stars).

The sound is great, and easily adjustable for different settings.  The pictures can be adjusted easily too depending on the type of tv watching you like to do.Cons:  If sitting at an angle, the colors wash out a bit (which seems to be common for this type of tv), but the picture clarity and sharpness are still there.  Also, I'm not certain if it's me not setting it right or the limits of my refresh rate, but there is a slight picture freezing.  (Not if someone's running on football or a car chase action sequence.

The picture on this tv definitely benefits from calibration (I use a calibration blu-ray). I was initially disappointed with the flesh tone representation on this set, but after some color correction, along with balancing the brightness and contrast, I can honestly say this tv looks great.I already own a 46\" Samsung 1080p LCD, but I think this 32\" 720p set might look just a little better.The only downside for this set is the remote.

It starts ok, looks ok, has weak audio, and a so-so remote.

If, like me, your reception is better during evening hours, you might find a channel doesn't receive during the daylight hours. God help you if you try to tune that channel and reception is poor. What this tv does is reroute you to the nearest receivable channel and delete your otherwise receivable channel. If you want to go to channel 8-1, and you key in \"8-1\", you will henceforth be redirected to the nearest currently receivable channel. No opportunity to tune to the channel and then adjust the antenna. Nope. Not possible. The ultra geniuses at Samsung think this is a bad concept and will not allow it. Stupid. Astonishingly stupid. I thought something was wrong with this tv but it is designed this way (I contacted Samsung customer support and they told me this is the way it is designed).

I did not notice it right away since I unpack it to look for damage , the placed it back in the box until I prepared the room I was placing it.  Around two weeks later I started to set it up.  I saw the crack when I removed the protected film that was pressed on the frame. The crack is in the upper left corner and separates the frame at that point.  I was disappointed when I called Samsung and explained the situation to customer service. I only asked that they send me a new trim piece that I would snap on myself.  After being placed on hold they came back and indicated they would not do that since 2 weeks had passed and they could not determine how the crack occurred.  They told me to contact my retailer and they would probably have me ship the TV back.
