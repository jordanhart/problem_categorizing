I had it sent to my dorm in Berkeley. This TV totally does its job. It acts as a great second monitor and as a great TV. The local HD channels look great on this thing (when I have my antenna properly adjusted). I also use it to play my Wii games. Using component cables, this TV excellently converts the 480p video output from my Wii to match the 1080p resolution of the screen, the video does not feel laggy or grainy. Also it remembers whether you prefer 4:3 or 16:9 for you SD TV viewing, so you don't have to keep resetting your preference each time you start it up like on lower-quality TVs(side note: I don't know how anyone can stand to watch SDTV stretched to 16:9 when it is meant to be 4:3, it makes everyone look short and fat)The only con I can see with this TV is that it lacks composite and S-Video inputs. The DVI, VGA, and 2 HDMI inputs are great, but that lack of a second component input or any composite inputs makes it difficult to use multiple non-HD devices on it.I strongly recommend this TV.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "I already spend to much time in the kitchen!", "Author": "Richard Stromberg \"Photo Buddha\"", "ReviewID": "R32CZ0SUS42VX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I installed this TV behind the sink in my kitchen.

Gironda", "ReviewID": "R1EAC0X5DRN61X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked up this set from a local retailer and then returned and ordered from Amazon because the price was $100 less!  We are using the 2333HD as a bedroom TV set, not connected to a computer at all... decided to go with this model because (1) it was better-priced than Samsung's 22\" TVs, (2) it was in stock and Samsung's 22\" TVs are hard to find, (3) the feature set was better--Samsung's 22\" TVs are not 1080p, and (4) it matched the room better because the walls are blue and this set has a blue glow to it (which can be turned off, unlike the red \"Touch of Color\" on the 22\" TVs).  The nice little SURPRISES we got with this deal were (1) a 6' HDMI cable in the box and (2) a great little TV with Optical Audio Out and other expandability features that I didn't expect.  For the price, this TV is great, picture is excellent with several settings to tweak and some presets as well, decent audio that wouldn't win any awards but certainly works well for watching the news in the morning and watching a movie while we were unpacking boxes (we just moved).  Some reviews have claimed \"tinny\" audio... don't forget that audio and picture are also dependent on the broadcast!!  That being said, don't expect little speakers to give you beautiful, rich surround sound--that's obvious!  10,000:1 contrast ratio has seemed adequate, I have not seen evident pixellation yet... and the level of motion blur did not distract me while watching an HD broadcast of college football or Air Force One (an action movie).  Air Force One DID show some dark-light pixellation but I think that was the broadcast--fast-moving commercials during the movie were crystal-clear in HD (I use Cablevision's HD broadcast, which is only 720p).  I highly recommend this item for a bedroom or college dorm room.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung Monitor/ HD TV", "Author": "L.

We thought our only choices were to add a TV (and find a place for it in a small room), or install a TV card in our computer.  Then I saw an ad for this monitor, and began price shopping.  Found a pretty good deal on Amazon.  Read the many reviews already posted; was a little disconcerted about the complaints about the audio quality, but decided to go ahead and take a chance.  Can I hear what they're complaining about?... yes, but, adding in external speakers, it's really not obvious enough to bother me in the least!  The only real complaint I have (like some others) is the size quality of the manual instructions.  I wear bifocals, but even with them, I had to get out a magnifying glass to be able to read which button was for what.  This isn't helped any by the fact that the location of the buttons... along the right hand side of the monitor, shiny black like the rest of the monitor, so if they've labeled, you can't see them.  Take my advice, and set up the remote first thing after you get the monitor plugged in!  Using the remote, everything's easy!  Also, if you don't have \"Cable\" service, select \"Air\" as the type of connection, even if you're connecting a coax cable to it.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV with one big drawback", "Author": "Not My Real Name \"Mt. Rainier\"", "ReviewID": "R1JUKS9PB14HTL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've seen the Samsung 2333HD advertised as a 23\" monitor with a TV tuner. Now why would they say it that way? I dunno, but I'll tell you what. This TV is nice colors, clear, crisp, heck it even tilts on its stand, plus you can use it as a computer monitor. I can't think of a reason not to buy this quality LCD screen... except...The speakers sound like a portable AM radio from the 1960's. Very tinny-sounding. I kid you not. It is not the richer sound of my 19\" Samsung LN19A650 (which I recommend, btw.) Why would the speakers be so lame? I had my 19\" in the bedroom, this 2333HD in the kitchen, so I even swapped  the rooms that they were in, but the tinniness followed the TV. I tried to use the equalizer and beef up the low end, lower the high end, but while it added bass, the tinny sound remained.Yes, this TV apparently has a multimedia sound. But that means you navigate to the Sound menu to where you select from Standard, Music, Movie, Voice, and Custom. What you find is that Custom and Standard were the best choices only because Music, Movie, Voice were even *more* tinny.I even thought maybe I would learn to get used to it, because I bought the TV at a good price, and, hey, the large 23\" screen is just soooo nice in quality. So, I gave it a chance. I tell you, watching this TV over a period of days gave me a subtle earache, that tinniness again.I boxed this 2333HD back up and will return it to the store. I just cannot hack that tinny sound. Why oh why would Samsung allow this to happen? So is that why places advertise this as \"a monitor with a TV tuner\"? Is it the phrase to be wary of?Update: I just figured out what the sound issue is with this 2333HD. This TV set does not have SRS TruSurround XT like my 19\" does. On that TV, I had turned the option ON right away, so had never played it without that option. Until this morning, when I turned the option OFF, and a slightly tinny sound came from the 19\", but nowhere as bad as on the 2333HD, but it was there. I turned the option ON again in my 19\", and the sound was much better, deeper, absolutely no tinniness to it. So, my lesson is, if the Samsung HDTV does not have the SRS TruSurround XT option, I will not buy it.", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV and PC monitor.", "Author": "Shawn A.

I picked this TV up at Staples for only $249.00. It is full HD which means that all of the major Network news and sports programs completely fill up the screen in high definition at 1920 x 1080 pixels. It is simply an amazing picture for this price. The added bonus is that it can hook up to your pc to extend or mirror your screen. I have a laptop pc and I use the 2333HD as an extension of my desktop which is 1600 x 1200. It is real nice to have that much desktop space when working with multiple documents and programs. The back of the TV has component color inputs for a DVD player as well as HDMI and DVI inputs for other video components. Samsung really rules this end of the market.

I had read and should have heeded other reviews regarding the poor sound of this unit. The picture on this TV is excellent, (like the other 2 Samsung TVs we have) the aesthetics of the unit are beautiful, and the remote is acceptable...but the sound...ugh. I don't want to overstate it but it is not even close to acceptable for use as a TV in a kitchen or anywhere else for that matter. It is light and tinny and there were no adjustments that I could find that corrected it to the point where it was acceptable. Our \"workaround\" was to attach two old computer speakers to the set and hide them behind it. That solution works well enough and works for us because we have the TV sitting in a corner of the counter and the speakers have plenty of space to reside behind the TV. The only minor issue is that the sound jack is on the side of the TV so you see a bit of the wire leading to the speakers. Bottom line...while workable as a TV and certainly inexpensive we paid $221 from Amazon...it is probably far better suited as a computer monitor in a situation where you already have speakers or some other sound system.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "SAMSUNG 2333HD MONITOR & HDTV", "Author": "Alton Rogers \"AGR\"", "ReviewID": "R2960QEB57YCPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two of these.

Hence, this 23\" tv screen is almost as large as my 22\" monitor, which is nice when running dual monitors as they are almost the same size.This tv has a headphone jack that the LG did not have, so I run that out to a powered subwoofer and speakers intended for a pc, providing much better sound.One drawback from my 23\" Olevia I replaced was this monitor does not have analog RCA plug input (red, white, yellow) which I was wanting for my security cameras.This little TV has the blue light at the bottom center just like my big Samsung in my living room.

That problem is common to lots of Samsung TV models and is frequently referred  to in forums as \"robot sound\". This robot sound occurs only under certain circumstances and only on QAM cable channels. QAM channels are high def channels that are received by cable customers that connect the coax directly to the TV without a cable box. These are the high def channels numbered 3.1, 4.2 etc.The first time you plug in the TV you will not have a problem with robot sound.  However if you unplug the TV to move it or you have a power outage you will likely have occasional robot sound on the x.1 type channels from then on. Samsung does not have a current firmware fix for this problem.  It can however be eliminated by resetting your TV back to factory specs.  To reset your TV hold down the \"exit\" button on your remote for about 10 seconds, a prompt will come up asking if you want to reset the TV, move the selection to the choice that performs the reset and hit the remotes enter button.  Unfortunately all of your customizations are now gone and you will now need to rescan all of your cable channels which can take 20 minutes or more, the same as you did when you first got the TV. But the robot sound will now be gone until the next time the TV loses power for any reason.But overall the picture quality directly attached to cable is excellent and I will be keeping the TV since we rarely lose power and there is a workaround to fix the sound.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love It, Love It, Love It!", "Author": "Jackie", "ReviewID": "R4MJZ6H37SCVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this as both a second Monitor and a TV and couldn't be more pleased.

I had Googled for the PDF menu to see the full packaging list and it stated that the monitor shipped with DVI and VGA cables, so I didn't order a cable.Problem #1: Imagine my surprise when I received it and found it now ships with just HDMI. My port replicator has displayport, DVI and VGA. Luckily I had a DVI-HDMI cable lying around so I decided to use that while I waited for a proper displayport-HDMI cable (which BTW, has been MIA in a UPS blackhole for the past 36 hours).Problem #2: when you connect this monitor through HDMI into a PC, it doesn't auto detect it as a PC, so it uses its default timing and the graphics look soft and fuzzy. The manual is terrible about this, but here is the fix: go to the menu and there is a section where you can rename the ports, simply change the HDMI port to PC and it will toggle the timing.The monitor itself is exceptional, it looks like a bigger version of a Samsung I had purchased earlier to hang in front of a treadmill, so we could watch TV at eye level while exercising but it is much more advanced. After less than half an hour I had already switched it to be my main screen. Text and graphics are very sharp, and the color calibration is acceptable for my use.The other thing I like is the flexibility. I can plug my HD cable box, Xbox 360 or AppleTV into it if I need to, instead of having a single-purpose monitor that I can only plug into a computer.Update 3/28/2010I love this monitor, the only difference between using the HDMI to DVI cable and the HDMI to Displayport cable is in how Windows 7 detected the display. I can't tell the difference in how the signal is displayed.

I was looking for a computer monitor for my kitchen that could double as a TV.  It seemed like it had everything I wanted: good size, TV tuner, built-in speakers, so that I wouldn't have to clutter up my countertops with any other little boxes.  I wanted a matte screen to eliminate glare in my well-lit kitchen.  Also, it was the largest monitor I could get that would fit underneath my kitchen cabinets.  Great price, too.  On paper, it seemed like the perfect choice in every way.  I checked it out in person and it looked great in the store, too.On the plus side, the picture is excellent.  It's got a really full feature set and, of course, it's a TV, too!  It has a decent number of ins and outs but does not have composite or svideo inputs.  I would have liked these, but I knew this before I bought it, so I'm not taking off any points for this.Now for the problems.  First, the audio is terrible.  I mean really terrible, so bad, it's hardly useable.  Now, I wasn't expecting much, as the speakers are quite small and low powered.  I saw other reviews and honestly, was expecting thin, tinny sound, which would have been acceptable.  What I got was much worse.  If I play any kind of music at all, anything with any low frequencies, I get his horrible resonance, this \"wuh - wuh - wuh\" sound that makes the audio completely unintelligible.  Even if I lower the volume below 25%, it's still there.  Ugh.  For some sounds, like voice, or the Windows system sounds, nothing with any low frequencies or complex sounds, it's marginally acceptable.Next, this is a computer monitor, right?  There's no way to get the monitor to go to low-power standby when using the HDMI inputs.  Standby does work when using DVI or VGA, but not when using HDMI.  It's actually greyed out in the menu.  This is ridiculous.  There's no technical reason in the world why this should be a problem.  The sleep signals from the computer are identical for HDMI and DVI, so there's no reason for this not to work.  They just didn't bother.  I thought an obvious oversight like this would have been corrected in a firmware update, but no.  Either this thing just sits on your desk, continually burning up 50+ watts, or you have to run two cables, video and audio, and use DVI. That's what I did.Last issue, Samsung's tech support was really clueless.  I was on the phone for almost two hours before the technician finally discovered that, yes, sleep mode is not supported at all for HDMI but is supported for DVI.  So sorry.  Regarding the audio issues, they were also no help at all.  I told them that my computer was fine.  I tested my computer with another set of speakers and the sound was fine.  I also used a second computer and the monitor's sound was still no good (but the second computer also worked fine with my other speakers).  The technician offered no solutions at all, wouldn't even recognize the possibility that maybe the speakers were actually damaged.  Are you ready for this?  I also tried their automated troubleshooting guide on Samsung's website. It went something like this:\"Are you having problems with distorted sound?\" - \"Yes\"\"Did you try a different set of speakers?\" - \"Yes\"\"Was the sound ok with the other speakers?\" - \"Yes\"\"If this sound is OK with your computer and another set of speakers but no good with our speakers, then the problem is with your computer.  Please replace your computer or sound card or change your sound settings.\"HUH????I emailed Samsung about this obvious discrepancy in their troubleshooting guide and got no reply.To summarize, this would be a really great monitor except for very poor sound quality, no sleep mode in HDMI, and abysmal customer / technical support.  I've taken off a star for each.By the way, I bought this monitor to replace a 19\" Samsung LCD that had failed prematurely, just after the warranty expired.  I thought I'd give them another chance.  I used to consider Samsung my first choice for monitors, offering great performance at a competitive price.  Now, I'm not so sure.  I gave them every opportunity to correct this.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Carl Mickens", "ReviewID": "R2R6DGYWITZTM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a decent size T.V. not too big and not too small.

The monitor can only tilt, it won't swivel. With how hard the stand installation was, I can't imagine how you're even supposed to remove it. If you want height adjustmant and rotation for the monitor I suggest trashing the stand it comes with and getting a Ergotron Neo Flex LCD stand.(EDIT) I got this TV two years ago and you had to attach the neck of the stand to the TV which was frustrating, but now they seem to ship these TVs with the neck already installed which is great. I still don't know how you're supposed to take it out if you want to wall mount or something though.CONNECTIVITY: Connectivity on this monitor is very good; There are two HDMIs, a DVI and a VGA port. I have this monitor connected to my PC and my PS3 and it works great. It also has a port in the back to watch public channels over the air, it picks up channels very well.AUDIO: I upgraded from >20 year old CRT that's older than me, and I have to say that the speakers on that TV are better than the 2333HD's. The speakers are quite bad but usable I suppose. The good thing is that this TV comes with a audio cable which you can connect from the TV's headphone jack to your PC's Line-in to play sound from PC speakers. This is only stereo sound but sounds miles better than the TV speakers. The TV also has a handy audio equalizer to play with. I strongly recommend playing with it as you can make the sound much better than the default settings.VIDEO: Picture quality is good for watching movies and playing games. Viewing angle from the horizontal viewing angle is pretty good but the vertical viewing angle is shabby. It isnt the best for graphic work but its decent enough if you're not anal about color accuracy. Colors are very oversaturated from the start which is to be expected with most of Samsung's monitors/TVs so I strongly suggest adjusting the video settings. Theres a Dynamic Contrast option by default for the PC which auto changes the backlight and makes everything super saturated so I suggest turning that off. Obviously this is not a professional monitor for graphic artists but that's not what it's designed for. There's also a considerable amount of backlight bleed; the backlight is on ten by default, I'd suggest turning it down to 7 or 8.Value: Price is good but there are cheaper monitors with same/better picture quality but with less connectivity.Overall its a versatile monitor that is perfect for entertainment use with PC and game consoles.Its also pretty decent for hobbyist graphic artists and photographers. Great if you want a monitor with decent picture quality and great connectivity for a good price.

When it finally synced up like it normally does, the screen got really fuzzy as if it was The Flash vibrating at lightning fast speeds.  I tried it on Windows 7 as well but it was only slightly better, leading me to believe it was some hardware issue with either my laptop or the screen.  Probably the screen.- When hooking up those regular RCA cables (Red, Yellow, White), I found out it only provides input for audio (Red and White) and video is only component (Red, Blue, Green).  I'll have to use a converter for the coaxial input so that I can use any regular RCA inputs.Other than that, this TV has exceeded my expectations, especially for the price of approximately $200!

Looked as Dell, Acer and Samsung monitors. The guy at Best Buy recommended Samsung, Acer, and Dell in that order, with Samsung being the best.I was impressed by the Samsung monitors, and Staples had a 21.5 inch \"new model\" Samsung for 169.95, and this 23\" monitor for 239.95 which was on sale.The 21.5 inch Samsung did not appear to tilt up or down, as did this 23 inch. Otherwise I may have bought it because it was a good price, but glad I did not.And I was intrigued by the fact that I could use the 23\" as a PC monitor AND  as a 2nd TV (in the same room as my 50\" Samsung HD TV, but watching different channels).Bought the 23\" and brought it home.Went to Amazon.com to see if I got a good deal. Was a bit concerned to learn that there was a \"newer\" model available. (24.6\" for 289.99) But after reading all 28 reviews of the \"newer\" model (a few negative) and the 77 reviews of this model (mostly very positive) I felt I had made a good choice.Hooked it up to my \"old\" PC through the VGA connection and to my Cable TV through the coax input.Turned it on and both the PC and TV worked without any manual changes on my part. (The Monitor did spend some time \"auto\" setting up the channels for my TV)Not sure which channels are HD and which are not. Perhaps I should connect my cable box to the monitor with an HDMI cable instead of the coax?Overall I a very pleased. Both PC and TV displayed fine out of the box. I may try downloading newer drivers for the TV as some have suggested. I am running Windows XP, but my new computer will be running Windows 7.The only negative is that the remote control that comes with the monitor sends out the same signals as does my Samsung 50\" HD TV remote. So I need to hold it close to my monitor, or else it will change my TV also. (The monitor is only about two feet from my chair, and the TV is about 6 feet.)One day latter...I am even more impressed with the purchase. Am watching baseball on my 50\" TV and have the 23\" monitor tuned to watch Soccer.

I have a large screen Samsung LCD HDTV that I am very pleased with.However, upon hooking this one up to my new PC, that included a very capable NVIDIA GTS 250 video card, I was surprised to see very poor quality text displays. Graphics were pretty decent but reading text was painful. I tried the HDMI interface first and went through re-installation of both video card and monitor drivers (be aware that the Samsung 2333HD has both a digital driver and an analog driver), various calibrations and resolutions, etc. etc.  I then tried the analog interface with even worse results -  looked like there was a frequency problem since the text was very \"shimmery\" as well as jagged. I had also noted that the monitor had a very high pitched squeal coming from the back - it was quite noticeable when sitting in front of the monitor but not so much when viewing it as a TV from 10 feet away. Note -the HDTV quality was very good.Conclusion - I returned this monitor and bought an Acer P244w that performs superbly.  If you want a small HDTV this one is probably a decent choice - but as a computer monitor it may be wise to look elsewhere.

It's only 1yr.?(wasn't seen on Amazon easily) of course being the unlucky numb nut I am didn't realize till I had home,Ok my bad. I bought this to use mainly as a computer monitor but in directions they act as though it's only a TV,comes w/ a HDMI cable but no cables to hook up a to computer?

So out of desperation and a little research( luckly have another computer)found out that DVI cables are more for digital connections and VGA are more for analog.Of course none of this was in directions and after I hooked this up,computer said \"No cable connections\" WTF,had it in pc source,just when I was about to give up and consider returning I tried the DVI  source on monitor and wow success, why would'nt work in pc source on this monitor is beyond me and no thanks/help to lousy directions booklet.Haven't tried as tv yet(plan on HD air to antenna) see what fun that brings.

That is what my HP w2207 monitor did. Unfortunately, HP was an exception which was never replicated by any of my Acer 22\" and 23\" monitors (cheap Best Buy units on sale at the time of purchase) nor with this Samsung 2333HD. None but the exceptional HP monitor got their native resolutions straight out of the box. Acers went back the the stone shop immediately. A smart move.(badly written EDID drivers.. unless it is your hobby to fix them...avoid)Less luck with this Samsung, which I bought online at eCost with their particular return policies (no returns on selected brands). I bought their extended warranty but it does not cover driver issues. (It is your fault that you try to connect their just about perfect monitor to your incompatible hardware.) Now it has been 7th day since I have opened the box. Finally time to fix the resolution...if only it were done easily. I spent the afternoon tinkering.I updated my video card driver and the HD resolution IS supported by my notebook's Radeon 9200. I downloaded and installed the Samsung driver from their support page and then uninstalled and reinstalled it many times. There are still wide margins around the desktop, I must scroll from side to side to see the 1920x1080 that the card sends correctly to the monitor but the monitor displays only part of it. Maybe a simple issue as it still looks as if the drivers are not loaded..but no fix worked for me yet. Maybe just need a DriverGenius (software). Even better...become a DriverGenius (person) myself.I reached the end of my wit. I do not have HDMI or DVI option on my older system (as somebody suggested would be a fix).Apart from my elderly Compaq nx7000 (Radeon 9200) i tried Fujitsu 4020 (Full HD not supported by the integrated Intel graphics) and Asus 1000HD. The last one has also Intel integrated graphic card but the resolution IS supported. I try ... does not work (1900x1080 can be set on a display but not on the monitor, the option is grey-not available). This makes it 3:0 (Three systems zero success).That is the reason I am giving Samsung Syncmaster 2333 HD TV low rating. So far it did not work at the highest resolution as a PC monitor, which is my primary intended use. I liked the idea of having additional TV on my PC monitor. If only the monitor worked at its native 1920x1080.I spent time on Samsung chat and Samsung phone. No resolution to my resolution (pun intended).Other then that the monitor - the TV is fine. The features are nice, the pictures is top-notch. (I am not an expert on the picture quality.  You can read a lot praise in other reviews so I am not repeating it here.)Update: I have been avoiding using this monitor for the past 2 weeks due to the issues above. No fix so far. As it is it scrolling around is REALLY annoying. I was considering trying to outsmart the (supposedly) EDID issue by going with Tritton SEE2 Xtreme (external usb to vga/dvi card) but this is particular card is definitely not a way to go (based on the reviews.)Update II: The resolution issues have been resolved with Diamond BVU195 USB to DVI adapter from Amazon/Buy com. I run the monitor on DVI and avoid D-sub completely. This should work also for my other laptops/netbooks that I reported problems on D-sub. I am upgrading my rating to 4 stars.Update III. I do not want to flog this one issue too much. You can read at Diamond BVU195 comments that the solution has not been a complete success.  I have issues with functionality having to work with two displays that randomly load my apps, taskbars, etc..; they load behind TV so I cannot double task unless I disconnect/reload the PC first or toggle between TV and PC on the remote.HD works great and you have the highest res TV on a $200 price point system. Somebody was wishing for a picture in picture...surely not on this one. As I remarked earlier the TV is fine and a lot of features and connectivity for the price, HDMI, DVI, D-Sub,DVI audio in, component Pb Pr Y, audio R and L, toss-link for optical audio. TV works as expected just need a more sensitive/better placed antenna then I put it on. No issues with sound. I did not explore this one in depth but for regular TV viewing w/o home theater ambitions the sound on the TV/monitor itself is about OK. Mute on the remote works :-)To sum up: The price point and overall value is good but I wish I did not have to come up against the resolution. For those of you who connect it to an HDMI system and do not need to bother about drivers or just want not only a plane Jane TV but a beautiful one too with a lot of connectivity you have a performer here. (I wish I could apply \"mute\" on real life beauties as efficiently as on this one. No offense girls/ladies/mam's.)I watched ice skiting competition from up close yesterday in full res... stunning... It works for me mainly as a monitor and I watch TV only exceptionally: sitting close up to sharp hi-res moving picture (at close up distance of a monitor)...stunning.Update IV 7.14.2011: I had less luck trying to play video through the diamond adapter [freezes/crashes the system] even on my now upgraded i7 notebook....but hey...at least there is now hdmi and dvi on the new notebook [..I mean - at least on the port multiplicator...]...finally I can run the monitor with the digital port [almost] directly - as intended - and run away from the issues that stuffed my review above.With the hindsight I am happy with the monitor: at the time of purchase it presented good value for the price and it still goes strong after two years. I did not have any other issues with it than I reported. If I were in the market today I would consider possibly LED backlight and a lighter weight panel. (It would have been a must for transporting it around). But I do not need to upgrade yet. Overall a good value monitor.
