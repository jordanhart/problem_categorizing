Now I can go back in time and experience things I could only dream of.  Now NASA is calling me to use my Holodeck.  I recently purchased a space suit from e-bay and now I can do my own space walks.

But wow!!! In the past when the disgruntled spirits dwelling beneath our house would suck our 5 year old daughter into the inter-dimensional limbo through our television it was a real pain in the butt trying to recover her. Well not anymore! Two days after this baby got delivered those pesky spirits were up to their old tricks again, sucking my daughter into the void, but this time it was practically no hassle at all! I was able to essentially walk directly into this tv, no crouching, slouching, or crawling for this guy! There was even enough room for me to take a couple of my buddies who were interested to see what my wife is always complaining about! I don't expect the ghoulish abductions to cease anytime soon, and there's no way we're moving (our mortgage is unbelievably low!), so this much more conveniently sized gateway to hell is going to be cherished for years to come.

After taking out a second mortgage I was ready to start enjoying the best TV ever. Then I saw that Samsung has done it again. Goodness gracious! I said to myself. I need it for the master bedroom! But the bank will no longer allow me to finance.  I had tried to sell my plasma but it was not getting me the cash flow I needed. My doctor did tell me that I had an extremely rare blood type that would allow anyone to be able to take my blood and, if nessesary, my organs. That was it! I would sell one of my organs I did not need. Perhaps my kidney or a part of my liver. I contacted a friend who contacted a friend who had Mr.Black contact me. Mr.Black stated with my blood type a kidney would only fetch me 20,000. And a piece of my liver was a mere 8,000. He did however inform me that if I were to sell one of my lungs, he had a buyer who was willing to pay 45,000. Now I was skeptical at first but the thought of a falling  asleep in the warm glow of that Adonis of TV's convinced me. Long story short my oxygen mask obscures my vision occasionally but in the end i have no regrets.

This $35,000 \"steal\" may seem like a killer deal, but it is not.  First of all 4K HD is already old news.  Materials researchers and scientists are working on a 4x4xHD TV.  That is like 16 regular HD TV's, which is 4 of these TV's.  The reason it is so cheap is because it is about to become obsolete technology.  Second, this TV may look big in the photo, but in reality 85 inches is only enough to take up a living room wall in a tiny apartment.  If you own a house with a full sized living room you are going to need 3 of these just to cover up your wall.  Third, this TV broadcasts only in 3 dimensions.  String theorists theorize there are at least 11 dimensions.  3/11 is not acceptable.  Fourth, the TV does not float in the air as pictured, magnetic levitation does not come standard on it.
