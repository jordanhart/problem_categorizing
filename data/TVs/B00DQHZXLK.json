The TVs, no matter which size, are basically the same model from LG, but depending on screen size, the features on the back are different. For instance, some are saying only 1 HDMI.....that all depends on which size TV you order. I purchased the 47\" and it has 2 HDMI ports.  It's best to go to the LG web site to check and make sure what your model actually has on it.Here is what is on the back of the 47\" 47LN5200:2 HDMI-In Ports - one on side, one on back1 USB-In Port - on side1 Optical Digital Audio Out - on backAntenna In / Cable In - on backAudio In - on back - red and whiteComponent In - green, blue, red (video Y, blue Pb, red Pr)This is NOT a Smart TV.TV is easy to set-up. How often can a female lift and carry a 47\" TV without help?  Certainly not in the old days with the CRT types of TVs.  You can wall mount this with the Vesa 400 x 400 or use the included stand which feels strong and secure. Tighten 7 screws and you're ready to go. This also comes with one extra screw that will go through the stand (into wood) if you choose to anchor this TV to a table made of wood. The stand does not swivel.Picture quality is very good with sharp, bright colors. It's a 60 Hz refresh rate, not 120 Hz like TV's priced higher, but since I don't watch many sporting events, this doesn't matter to me. Although I did briefly watch a football game and saw a little blurring on the edges of the players when they show close-up, fast-moving plays.The screen isn't a dull matte finish, but it's not glossy either. Just perfect, I see no glare in daylight or at night when I have a lamp on.The speakers are a little tinny-sounding on the treble, but once I accentuated the bass more, they sound OK. Certainly not theatre-quality, but I plan on running my stereo through the TV eventually. It's nothing so horrendous that is worthy of knocking my rating down to 4 stars.Regarding USB, you can connect a flash drive or an external hard drive to the TV, but you can only use it for photos or music. You cannot play movies stored on these devices. It supports .jpg and .mp3 only.A 31 page printed manual comes with it, but you also get a CD that has the full 62 page manual.I think it's a wonderful TV considering the price (it was $399 when I bought it, but the Amazon pricing flucuates daily).

Most TV speakers are the weakest point of any set and using a reciever with speakers you can hook up as many HDMI devices and have one HDMI cable from the reciever to the TV negating the lack of inputs on the TV itself.  You get far better sound, dont have to worry about lack of inputs and most recievers have built in video scalers to sharpen up the picture.  The sound has far more impact than the image itself and it amazes me people buy large flat screen TV's and still use the built in speakers which can't even come close to portraying the entire frequency range.  HDMI cables can be bought cheap at sites like Monoprice dot com for about 4.00 each and for the cost of the TV you can buy a reciever with six or more HDMI inputs and a pair of good speakers with a built in video scaler.  Ive given you the calibration settings so use the money you would've spent on calibration and buy a reciever.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 42\" 1080p LED TV from LG", "Author": "J", "ReviewID": "R14QCZR6RWH8HL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great 42\" 1080p LED TV from LG for just under $400.As it is 60Hz (not 120Hz), it may not be great for sports, but for everyday/office usage, it is perfect.A couple qualms about the device:1) 1 HDMI out in the back, not side of the device.

First, I have been on the high end side using the JVC RS-1 among other projectors and enjoyed quality on big screens 100\" or so. Was interested in the Panasonic Plasmas but they are gone and was concerned about the contrast of a set like this. The numbers are apparently almost impossible to find although one site claimed a high number.That aside, all the discussion of HDMI ports and audio are truly sideshows. If you want more than two HDMI ports, a quick visit to buy a three port (automatic) adaptor is dirt cheap. I run one that way so only use HDMI port and it's one button control over everything using a Harmony remote. Audio? It's adequate, but I use a Rotel receiver with an old set of Paradigm Reference 20 speakers on stands and mute the internal audio.A friend has a 47\" Sharp Aquos model from a few years back and it's a nice picture but I don't enjoy the artificial screen door effect. As this is a 60hz model, that's no issue. Motion blur? I don't know what anyone would complain about. Basketball, football, soccer, ice hockey, I've yet to see it. YMMV.Running this with one HDMI port on a Mac Mini. Everything looks very good.The level of performance at this price point shows frankly the HD industry has entered commodity status with a very good picture available for a very low (decent) price. Are their better options? Sure, especially if you are set on wifi internal to your HD TV device. Are there better pictures on other sets? Probably depending on personal taste but you get a lot of bang for your buck on this and clearly this model is already being phased out for the 120 hz models and if you don't like the soap opera effect well here's an inexpensive option.This picture is quite enjoyable and setting up one of the inputs to the listed settings on this thread is very impressive.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bare bones TV with great picture", "Author": "Miles Lindgren", "ReviewID": "R25A8G5MWQ8WCP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to go with this TV because I wanted the best value TV with minimal frills. I use my TV with Chromecast and hooked to my laptop so I didn't want Smart TV, and I don't care about 3D in particular.  Assembly of the base and initial setup were easy, and the picture was good right away.However, the difference in content quality becomes a lot more important with a large TV like 50 inches. I had come from a 32\" TV, where it was easy to watch low quality broadcasts. From a similar viewing distance, the low quality is a lot more apparent on the larger TV.That said, with HD content the picture quality is stunning. I sat and re-watched BBC's Life in Blu Ray and a few other favorites. Great picture quality is all I had hoped for with this TV, and that's what I got.I can think of just one small gripe. There is no 3.5mm audio output! Or any analog output at all. This means you're stuck with optical output only.

I had to get out the measuring tape to make sure it was 50 inches.  Screen size was the same as my old plasma.  The picture is nice and bright after i went into the menu and took it off energy saver mode.  With energy saver on it was rather dim and lifeless. First impression of the sound quality was that it sounded cheap, like something you would expect from a no name TV, but after playing with the sound controls I am happier with the sound quality.  Not 100% but it wouldn't keep me from buying it again.  Inputs are a little messed up.  There are only 2 hdmi inputs, one is on the back and one is on the side.

Overall, it is a very good TV for the price and a big upgrade from my last TV which was probably one of the last beastly Sony 40\"WEGA tube TV's they made. Compared to that TV which was a beast at about 120+lbs this LG one weighs in at a quarter of my old one which took 2 people to move. I have had no problems with it and set up was easy and fast.  It has a very good quality picture (on CINEMA setting via HDMI), and like has been said by others it does have a minimum number of inputs. Sure this can be a challenge if you need to add a DVD, DVR, XBox etc etc..but who cares about plugging and unplugging a few cables every now and then - not me - and if I really cared I would get a central unit or would have planned for that but I was planning for a good TV for the price - not for 50 different inputs. For connections it has RCA/Composite, HDMI (2 HMDI - one rear and one on the side) and your standard BNC for cable. The USB is also available but seems for photo & music mostly from the input selector.  Sound/speakers are a little \"basic\" in audio, and at low volume it sounds a bit thin, but it can get pretty loud and fill out for sound when you boost the level. Menu is easy to operate and the  Overall for the price it is a nice TV and great for a bedroom or guest room.

I would not recommend this set for your living room surround sound theater sound component pic/mobile/Xbox/PS4/etc. needs. A DirecTV box and a DVR player is all I needed for my bedroom. That's two HDMI inputs...perfect! The lack of a star is due to the absence of a standard speaker plug. My prior Scepter 46\" HDTV purchased here on Amazon 5 yrs ago had way below average TV sound quality. I bought a great pair of computer speakers and voila, sound problem solved. There is no sound plug on this set to plug in those same great speakers. Silver lining, the regular TV sound quality is serviceable, much better than the old Sceptre and it appears I can safely do without. There is an internal \"surround sound\" setting that I now use and it is more than serviceable quality sound for virtually all programs. If you want a great picture with no frills and don't mind good standard acceptable and clear sound, this is gold for the price.May 9, 2014 addendum -> There is a review by MGB on the ideal picture settings of this product. When you see the review you'll recognize the technical appearance. Find it. Follow his exact technical adjustment recommendations for this model. I did. The picture really is superior. It's better than what I eyeballed myself while using the very basic settings that all of us are pretty familiar with like contrast, brightness, backlighting etc. I also have an LG 55in 120mhz tru-motion more advanced quality set in my living room that's amazing. This guy's settings rival my 120 mhz advanced set picture quality. You're paying less for a 60mhz picture, but after the proper adjustments you won't be able to tell the difference from TV sets with much better specs.

Ordering, shipping and delivery went off without a hitch.  Crew that delivered it, had it unpacked and set up in about 30 mins.  We are on satellite, so getting going is always somewhat of a task:  first we activate the receiver or the TV (order does not matter), but each one has to be activated separately.  Channels are selected by the receiver remote, not the TV remote.  BUT the volume and mute are activated by the TV remote.  Its takes some getting use to, but the TV remote is designed for little children's fingers, not adults.  Small, small buttons that are crowded together so you cannot operate it by feel or familiarity; you've got to look for the button you want, and then be careful to push only it without hitting an adjacent button.  An annoyance, but a big for  me, as I am a constant user of the mute button.  Solution?  Buy a universal remote?  For $78 at Costco.

Then its slightly noticeable but . .i knew the refresh rate when i bought it and everything else is great.i don't know how the speakers sound because i hooked it to my stereo right away with the optical out cable and was in business. i have my Xfinity cable box and Xbox 360 hooked up to this via the 2 HDMI ports and both look great. did a little adjusting on the picture because this has an ECO mode that dims the screen. i didn't like it set like that so i changed it.overall. great TV for the price. nice clean, crisp picture with minimal bezel surrounding the screen with the only thing it really lacks is a higher refresh rate and a few extra HDMI ports but I knew about this when i bought it.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Met needs", "Author": "orlando ward", "ReviewID": "R2II6EBAB5Y1P3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Used primarily  for gaming (black ops, etc.) his tv does what's expected.

I received the TV and hooked it up only to be disappointed by it promptly malfunctioning. The TV would shut itself down after anywhere from 20 seconds to 20 minutes. The only way to turn the TV back on is to unplug it for a few seconds and then plug it back in.After spending a few hours trying to solve the problem myself... switching outlets, trying different combinations of sources, holding my left ear, wiggling my left foot... no luck. I spent more time on the web only to find out that it appears to be have some serious problems. I should have just boxed it back up and had it on the next UPS truck in the morning, but I thought, \"I'm not that kind of consumer... It's under warranty. It just needs a little repair.\"The next morning after I spent another hour before work trying the TV some more (come on you all hope things magically fix themselves, too) I called LG customer support. We walked through the problem and arrange a time for a technician to come take a look. I would have to take a half day off work to be available for the technician. I should have just boxed it back up and had it on the next UPS truck that afternoon, but I thought, \"I just had the unlucky misfortune of getting a lemon... the price I pay for a good deal and being able to shop in my pajamas.\"I took off work yesterday and let the technician examine the TV. When he realized it was brand new he said, \"Wow, you should have just boxed this thing up and had them send you another one. Amazon has a 30 day policy.\" I told him I was content with having him fix it. I understand that once a malfunctioning part is replaced the unit should be in new condition. Good enough for me. The technician said that the problem was either a bad power supply or main board, both of which would require him to order the part, wait about a week for delivery, and reschedule a time for me to take another half day off work for him to repair the TV. He reiterated that I should just return the TV and get a replacement. I could have the TV sooner than he could repair it.After caving to the pressure of my wife, friends, coworkers, and now the TV technician, all of which have witnessed me spending a ridiculous amount of effort trying to turn a bad purchase from Amazon into a good one, I decided to start to the process of getting a replacement. (On a side note, a coworker decided to get one of the deals from Best Buy and he is loving rubbing his good experience in my face, telling me each and every movie or game he watched each night. Then he asks what I watched on the TV from Amazon and my whole department laughs) I go to the returns tab and discover \"Replace\" is grayed out. I click for more info and it said it's unavailable for replacement due to being out of stock, so I check myself. It is indeed in stock through a third party seller for $200 more than I paid for my paper weight, but the Cyber Monday TV for the low price is no longer available. The option for a refund is available but I don't necessarily want a refund. I want the TV I wasted Cyber Monday on. I should have just boxed it up and had it on the next UPS the next morning, but I thought, \"No, this is Amazon. They will make this right. Who wouldn't?\"I found an option to chat with a customer support rep so I decide to spend some more time to salvage this business relationship. After spending over an hour chatting with Amazon I discover that I'm out of luck. They are unwilling to honor the deal they offered. They advertised a functioning TV for a price. I paid that price. I received garbage instead of what I purchased and they will not provide what they advertised. I spent hours trying to get the TV to work. I spent hours researching the problem. I spent hours with LG customer support and tech support. I spent hours of PTO to be available for a technician. I spent hours dealing with Amazon customer support. I will be spending hours boxing this junk back up to ship to Amazon. I will be waiting days for a refund to be credited. And right now I'm going to be spending hours posting this review on every available social media outlet... and the only thing I get from Amazon is sorry for the inconvenience and be sure to check out their incredible deals next Cyber Monday.Way to go Amazon.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I loved it for four years....but afraid to purchase another", "Author": "shoe fanatic", "ReviewID": "R2CS2S4G6SGEQC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned this model television for about four years.

Unfortunately, for the consumer all of these t.v.'s will have varying problems and the experts indicate that we should not expect these t.v.'s to last beyond five years (three years if we're lucky).  I had to write this review, as I am on Amazon looking to replace this t.v. for my bedroom.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Package was damaged and TV screen broke", "Author": "Uncle sam \"yomama\"", "ReviewID": "R1MPSXOPBVKHPB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will attempt to keep this G Rated. Package arrived damaged. The TV screen was also broke. Amazon would not replace the TV because they said it was now out of stock. So on Christmas morning I now have a broken TV and the extra bonus of having to ship it back and now go shop for another one. First time I have had trouble with Amazon and I hope it is the last. I don't know if it was damaged prior to leaving Amazon or if it was damaged during shipping but when it arrived it was clearly damaged so I took photos prior to opening package. Hopefully the refund process goes smoother than the purchasing! If it sounds too good to be true (Price) it probably is.

I thought I was getting a great deal!Then it didn't ship for 2 days, so the delivery got pushed back a day ( I get it, the holidays are busy for all the retailers). But then UPS said it was left at the warehouse or maybe it fell off the truck because the box was all dented and taped back together when it finally arrived (4 days later). Of course the screen was completely broken and when I went on amazon for a replacement that option was no longer there since it is only sold by third party now. If it had arrived on time, there probably would have been replacements still available. When I called they said that I could get oCosmo TV as a replacement, since they were no longer selling this LG TV. One of the customer service reps said they would credit me an extra $10 (which I have yet to see), because that would make up for the $200 in savings that I lost out on, instead of buying this elsewhere on Cyber Monday for only $30 more.Returning it was even more of a pain, it took several emails and calls to get a shipping label, so I could drop it back off to UPS. Instead they tried to schedule UPS and CEVA shipping to pick it up, so I could wait around for a 4 hour window and then not have UPS show up. After UPS said they would be there between 12:15-4:15pm on 3 consecutive day, they finally showed up during the window, after I had already called to cancel the pick up and dropped it off at a UPS store.At this point I got my refund and I will be looking elsewhere for a TV, but likely will not find a deal this good.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "The picture quality is not as good as expected.
