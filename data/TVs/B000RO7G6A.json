I personally went through 5 lcd tvs within a month to figure out which is the best.  Hands down this LG model is great.  Great for gaming which is the main purpose for getting it(xbox360).  In all honesty i had a 1080p hdtv before i got this and there isnt much difference.  The fast 5ms time insures no ghosting or movies and gaming. It did take some tweaking but the colors that came preset were perfect and all i adjusted was brightness and messed with the xd engine. The speakers are great.  If you want the best bang for your buck buy this tv.  LG is a great brand", "Date": "November 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Bang for the Buck", "Author": "AWGamer11", "ReviewID": "R2V00ZNJDGIKA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LG is a well known quality maker of LCD panels for quite a while...this TV is no different. If you are looking in the 32 inch range, this is the sweet spot. You can spend lots more for other brands, or you can enjoy this high quality value. It has a stunning 32 inch 720P HD picture with a built in HD tuner. There are LOTS of ports, including 2 HDMI and 2 sets of component inputs...enough for all your high end components such as surround sound systems or XBOX or PS3 or whatever it might be! The XBOX 360 games looked incredible on this tv when I set the xbox to HDTV and 720p mode...incredible clarity. The response time is great on this LCD, making video games and movies look amazing. I think you will be VERY surprised what this TV can do for the price...I chose it after seeing it on a display wall up against 6-7 other brands...this was the sharpest most colorful picture by far, it wasn't even close.I'd look for this model on SALE as the price seems to float around $700 or so depending where you go. My only complaint? I want the 37 inch version now too!!!", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "AWESOME PICTURE! HIGLY RECOMMEND!", "Author": "Daniel Holbrook \"Dkrjeaeo\"", "ReviewID": "R11FKUJTX5V06F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV was a replacement for a Sony Bravia \"M\" series. We were very unhappy with the Sony's picture. We bought this due to the price and the contrast ratio of 8000:1. We were PLEASANTLY surprised! This tv is great! Nice looking, SUPER sharp and clear picture even on non-HD channels.I would definitely say this is worth more than what we paid! We did get the warranty only because LG reliability is not yet determined since the tv's are so new.", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price!", "Author": "Elizabeth Ann Vincent \"Electronics Junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R10QCSKYN1CRW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it. It replaced a 27\" tube TV that was not ready for the digital transition. Now I have an HDTV with a built in digital tuner. This TV paired with my DishNetwork VIP612 HD-DVR is an unbeatable combination. Great picture, adequate sound and nice variety of inputs. Ordered it from Amazon, shipped by Beach Camera and I was watching HDTV in a matter of days. I recommend this TV to anyone looking for a reasonably priced HDTV. I also have the 20 inch version in my bedroom and it too does not disappoint.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "We love it!", "Author": "Holly VanEis", "ReviewID": "RPYDJ6F2UO80G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv did not disappoint.

Also when the TV is fine if I touch the remote it freezes the picture, so turn it off and on it does not respond to the remote for five seconds, turn it on again & it works for 2 to 3 hours then same problem. LG claim its a software problem, well I got link to the firmware update down load to my memory stick and stuck it in the usb port on the back of the TV, software update fine no problem, TV reset all my preference are lost no problem I can set it how I like it ,but now worst things are happening the screen goes black after 15 to 20 minutes and no sound now ,so the firmware did not work but caused more problems and less viewing time .No more LG product for me in life again .I bought the TV for $1000 us and the DVD up converting player for $110 + LG sound systemSo I could 1 remote to make life easer for me, but life is better for LG now since they have my money and all I have is problems.We should come together and attack LG about this problem and for dishonorable customer support or boycott them and their products for good, hundreds of thousands of people have this problem and nothing.What's the sense of a warranty if there no fix for your problems and you can't get your money back. I have bought so many LG products and now no fix there are millions of people who don't have a $1000us I now feel like I was robbed by an eletronic millionaire.Yes I am christopher and I realized that this tv do not have enough vents for cooling. what I did was to use a 4\" hole saw and cut a hole in the back and over the heat sink and install a 4\" fan with a usb plug and plug it into the service port so when you power on the tv it would power on. The tv is still ok today without that problen. This is not an easy task so get a repair man.Here are my picture of the TV with the fan installed.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy It", "Author": "V.

Exactly 2 years later (October 2009 - no extended warranty), I turned it on and had no picture, no sound.  Called LG and they had me attempt to do a hard reset on it, which did not work.  They offered me assistance with finding an authorized repair center, but I suspect it will be cheaper or about the same price to buy a new television.  No more LG for me.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "defective with unyielding customer service", "Author": "drmike", "ReviewID": "R2EZA8H2M7E5P2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV 5 months ago.  Narrowed it down to b/w Toshiba and LG.  At the time both were same price. Picures seemed pretty comparable. I decided on LG because it had a feature that I uesed everyday - an on time to wake up in the morning.Took it home, set it up.  Although it had an automatic clock setting that was supposed to set to the cable signal, it never worked.  So I set it manually. (the clock)  I quickly found out that it lost anywhere from 3 to 8 minutes per day. Now you might think the clock is not a big deal, but if you are like me who relies on the clock and on timer to get up in the morning, it means that you have to reset the clock every day or two - an inconvience, to say the least.So, after two main circuit board replacements which did not solve the problem, LG acknowledged that the series has a problem that they did not know how to fix.  So now what?  They offered to replace the TV.  Sounds good, but if they are all the same, it doesn't make sense.  They were unwilling to do anything other than exchange mine for another defective TV!  Policy!  I could go back to Circuit City and get store credit towards something else with LG's authorization letter - at a loss of $150 - the lowest price that they have sold this unit!  I explained this to LG.  No answer.  (They would not upgrade to the next model, etiher)  I asked for an extra year warranty to make me happy and for the inconvience of resetting the clock every 2 days.  Answer:  they don't do that.  By the way, that solution would not have costed LG 1 cent!!!!So, I could not let it go.  I wrote a detailed letter explaining things in detail to the CEO LG Electronics USA.  After having to call his administrative assistant 2 times, I was assured that this matter would be resolved.  2 weeks later I received a call from customer service happily informing me that they would be replacing my TV with the same model.  (Did anyone ever read my letter, review the multiple records already in customer service files, etc???)Another call to the CEO office and I was asked what I wanted.  I said my money back including tax. 3 days later I had a check and a moving company arrived to pack up the TV and send it back to LG.And to think they had the opportunity to solve the problem with something that would not have cost them a penny - 1 year extended warranty.  Now it cost them the cost of the TV and shipping with a moving company! and the bad PR that I feel compelled to tell to everyone.....P.S.  The picture and other features were pretty good....", "Date": "November 15, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "32\" LCD Integrated HDTV with Built-in ATSC/NTSC/QAM Tuner to receive over-the-air Digital Broadcast Signals and Unscrambled Digital Cable\nSuper IPS Technology reduces distortion and blurring caused by fast motion video and provides 178 degree wide angle viewing\nLG Simplink allows for convient control of other LG Simplink products using the HDMI connection\nLG's Exclusive XD engine uses six distinct processes to improve brightness, contrast, detail, and enhances color\n2 HDMI/HDCP inputs 2 HD Component Video inputs Digital Optical Audio Output RGB input and Side mount AV Inputs with S-Video", "Name": "LG 32LC7D 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://218.201.42.40:8080/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71zy9wV7G3L._SY300_.gif", "ProductID": "B000RO7G6A"}}
