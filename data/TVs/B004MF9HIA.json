{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "W. Weigel", "ReviewID": "R2AFEQTP3LR32M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this Toshiba to replace the 32\" TCL LCD in my bedroom - gave the TCL to my son.  Just got this TV yesterday and I wanted to give my first impressions and address some of the concerns listed in other reviews, both here and on other sites.  The three main criticisms of this TV were:1. Only two HDMI ports - I only needed one or two ports anyway, so this did not bother me. If you are purchasing this as your main unit, you need to weigh this considerably.  There are ways around it, such as a receiver with HDMI-in ports or an HDMI switch, but unless you own these already, it's money you could spend on a bigger TV.2. Sound - OK, the sound on this is not great, but it is not as bad as some people are making it out to be.  I would say it is about average for TV's of this size and level (I install TV's in clients' conference rooms from time to time).  I was really expecting it to be bad after some of the reviews, so when it pretty much sounded on par with my 32\" TCL, it kind of made me laugh.  I was also able to change the Dolby settings (Compressed or Normal - you have to decide what you like better) to improve the sound.  What critics probably dislike is the lack of bass.  There is pretty much no bass, but I feel the same way about every other TV of this size I have heard.  It does not have RCA or analog out, so you cannot install computer speakers, like some reviewers have complained about.  It does have an optical out, which is better because it is feature-forward.  I have a Panasonic soundbar already, so I plugged the TV optical out into my soundbar and everything sounded great.  I would never spend the money on a TV of this size and use the built-in speakers.  At the very least, go with a sound bar.  Panasonic makes a very good one and Vizio has one for under $100 on Amazon.  My Panasonic is perfect for the bedroom - shows and movies are immersive and the voices are crystal clear.  If you want a nice sound system with full bass and don't want to run wires or buy a receiver, get the Panasonic soundbar with the subwoofer.  If you just want to significantly improve the sound of the TV, you can buy the soundbar with no subwoofer.  It will do nicely (I do not have the subwoofer).3. Weak HD tuner - I have no idea what the critical reviewers are talking about.  This TV picked up every QAM channel, including unencrypted digital, that my cable company provides.  What this means is that I hooked the TV straight to my cable line and it picked up all of the local digital HD stations, the music stations, and cable analog stations.  It performed as well as my other TV's with no problem.  I then hooked up my indoor HD antenna and it picked up 38 stations, including every Milwaukee HD channel and some from Chicago.  I live almost 50 miles from Milwaukee and 70 miles from Chicago.  It worked as well or better than my other TV's.  To put this in context, if I look up on the web what channels I am supposed to receive for my location, it lists 25 stations.  I get 38.  The TV also has a nice feature that shows how strong the signal is when you pull up a channel.All in all, the Toshiba is a great TV for the money, especially at $399.98. The picture quality is excellent and the screen has a nice matte finish, so there are no reflections.  It is a 60Hz TV, so there will probably be some artifacting during Bluray movie action sequences, but that is to be expected.It was easy to set up and does everything I ask from a TV of this class.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great purchase thus far", "Author": "Paul M", "ReviewID": "R3B7JZICA4THTH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first HD television although I've had experience working with them due to my job as a computer tech.  The picture quality on this TV is on par with the better screens I've seen.  When a BR disk is playing (connected with HDMI) it's astounding.  The sound on the unit goes very high without the vibration I've heard other TVs produce at higher volumes.  The high notes are a bit sharp on the unit at higher volumes and the only reason I gave it a 4 star on sound quality.Setup was simple...snap together some plastic for the base and plug it in.I've not used the unit with any other devices outside of my BR player.  I've used Vudu, Netflix, normal DVDs and Blueray and all look great.  Even the standard definition DVD and Netflix feeds look sharp.If you're wanting a TV that's simple to use without any fuss or tweaking with settings or configurations this one is perfect as that's what I was looking for in a TV.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just what I wanted", "Author": "Ding", "ReviewID": "RDPN3A86EYM4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a long time waiting and searching and waiting I finally pulled the trigger on this TV.

There are very few models offering 1080 resolution on a 40 inch screen for right around $400. This TV is easy to set up and the picture is terrific. The only significant drawback is the audio. I had to max the bass and completely take out the treble, then crank the volume all the way, just to make it passable.Why they couldn't include an analog audio output is beyond me. I didn't intend to have to upgrade my entire home entertainment system just to buy a new TV. So now I'll have to drop anywhere from $40 to $100 for a digital to analog converter for my stereo or a basic sound bar just so I can get decent audio. Suddenly the terrific price for the TV looks more like a so-so price.If you already have optical digital audio equipment then this is not a concern to you; in which case I heartily recommend this TV for the video. If you still have an analog home audio system -- and you don't plan to upgrade soon -- consider the extra cost you'll need to enjoy this TV with your stereo or powered speakers.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Sound", "Author": "mark", "ReviewID": "R3BZGNO0ZEYU22", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good picture and good value for the money but the sound quality is unbearably poor.

Looks nice with the glossy black finish.  I moved up from an Emmerson 32inch 1080p LCD TV to this.**FIRST Impression**After setting up I turned the unit on to a high def. channel and the picture is good, nice and crisp; however, when I turn it up I immediately notice the sound being super tinny with no bass.  I expected the sound to not be great after reading several reviews, most of the flat panels I have owned have had OK sound, nothing great.  This TV is by far the worse sound out of the 3 different brands I have owned, but it does go up to 100 volume level and I have no problems hearing it, its just very tinny like I said.  I have read this in the reviews so no big surprise and I am currently shopping a sound bar, which I recommend to make this tv complete.  I was surprised my little 32 inch Emmerson had better sound but oh well.Overall I like the TV and for the money you can not get a name brand TV this size, unless its black friday or some kind of clearance sale and I would rather have a Toshiba brand TV than a Sceptre, Hisense, Coby, or any other off brands that are in this price range.---I will check in and update after I have gotten some more use out of it. Thanks and I hope this helps!******UPDATE******After having a little while I am noticing a little blur and mismatched sound, frame rate is only 60, but my 32 inch had a crisp picture so I am not used to the common LCD blurring problems. For 399 I am not complaining.******Newer Update*******Been watching a lot of tv and bluray movies and some gaming.  The blu-ray looks like crap compared to my old 32 inch emmerson from walmart and the high def channels on my direct tv look blurry and not crisp.  Kind of regretting going cheap, and wish I had a nice clear picture like my old 32 inch.  Do not buy if you are used to high end tvs, however if its your first I am sure you will enjoy.

Set it up with the included stand, chained it to the wall for safety, as the stand is a little narrow and I didn't want to tempt fate. Hooked this up to a junker PC running the latest copy of XBMC on Windows XP, this combo is awesome!

At the time I ordered the set, 4 out of 8 reviews complained about the sound.  I have a 37\" Toshiba a couple years old and the sound is excellent for use as a TV in a modest size room.  I discounted the complaints assuming that they were expecting more out of it than they should.  I expected this one to be similar to mine as far as the audio was concerned.I installed it for my friend and noticed immediatly after completing the channel scan that the audio on local DTV stations was not nearly as good as the Toshiba in my house.  The signal strength was excellent for all local channels, so that was not an factor.  One of the daytime network shows had particularly bad audio.  The two women in the room commented that the sound was tinny.  While that isn't a technical term that means very much, there was definitely some distortion that affected the sound quality.  I don't believe has anything to do with the quality of the speakers or their mounting within the chassis as them appear to be no better or worse than others I have seen.  The audio quality seemed better when a DVD was played.  The audio level was so low that the volume setting had to be above 80 for the smaller-than-usual viewing area.  I tried turning off the Dolby Audio Compression and there seemed to be some improvement in audio quality, but the level dropped so much that I turned it off in order to retain adequate sound level.  There is a digital audio output on the set, but no analog output.  It seems a significant design blunder not to include an analog audio output on a set that is targeted to those looking for a set with limited connectivity to replace an old CRT TV.The audio on this set is worse than the 'nothing-special' CRT TV it replaces.  If I happened to purchased it for my house, it would be on its way back to Amazon by now.  As of a few days ago, there were no firmware of hardward updated that might correct this problem.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba TV", "Author": "Aimee B", "ReviewID": "R16SWAL162VV71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this TV, bought it when I moved into my apartment last September.

Landry", "ReviewID": "R2B920IRDUWJ2D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fortunately, Amazon reviewers had warned me that the built-in speakers were tinny and pretty awful. They weren't kidding... They are actually worse sounding than my old Westinghouse LCD from 4 years ago and worse than a Samsung LCD from the same time period.Okay, so assuming you are going to hook this thing up to a stereo, a surround system, PC speakers, or a sound-bar... this is an incredible value. The picture is great. This is my second Toshiba LCD, and the picture quality is excellent. Seriously... 1080p and 40 inches for under $450, shipped to your door? It's insane to think that the 720p - 32\" Westinghouse I bought years ago was around $700, and that was a bargain at the time. How cheap can these things get?This TV will make you want to watch nothing but blurays... I have digital cable and a PS3, which can stream some movies and TV shows at 1080p. The digital cable looks great, except that you can really see the artifacting when there are fast movements of the whole camera. I hope digital cable starts using a better compression method someday... Anyhow, Netflix HD content looks great on this TV. However, blurays look insane, and this is really the reason to bother owning a 1080p set.As compared to other LCD 1080p TVs, I did go to Best Buy and compare the picture quality to all of the competitors... Granted, these aren't really the best conditions to try and compare picture quality (in a brightly lit store, random video content, all the TVs set to the default settings). However, the Toshiba was at least holding its own with other TVs that were twice the price, and many of the things that I didn't like about one TV or the other could be fixed by adjusting the settings. So pretty much, with all of the name brand TVs, the picture quality was great. Things that are present in the higher priced models where mostly things that I didn't want to pay extra for... such as internet connectivity (I'm using a PS3 for Netflix and video file playback) and LED backlighting (it didn't seem to result in a better picture, although it did reduce the depth and weight of the TVs). And I didn't test them out, but I'm hoping that some of the more expensive models came with better internal speakers than the Toshiba.So, in my house, hooked up to my stereo and playing a bluray, it's hard to imagine this TV being much better - the picture can be mind-blowing with the right source - and it's definitely a steal at around $450 with free shipping.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 40E210 LCD HDTV", "Author": "S.

We got it as a floor model, last one available and was the right place to replace a tube TV. The picture quality is definitely not on par with, lets say, a Vizio but you cannot beat the price and it does what it supposed to do--be a television. We have had difficulties with connecting various devices like a DVD player, but such is life. There are options to set the size of the screen image and we have played with many of the options and really, no option is really perfect.Overall, we are happy. It is a lot better than a tube TV which is what we had before.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice picture but sound quality is lacking", "Author": "C.
