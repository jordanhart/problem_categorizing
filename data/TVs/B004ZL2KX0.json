Excellent picture, easy setup and it was able to find a number of \"unlisted\" channels on the cable system including HD versions of the local network channels the the other TV was not able to find.The picture quality is outstanding with the high contrast ratio and very effective light sensor. It's only a 60 Hz set so games may not look too good but so far the tickers etc. that normally smear with less than 120 hZ are clear as a bell. The new graphics engines and the 8 ms panels are amazing.. This one doesn't have all the internet connectivity but that isn't needed for this application and you can get a lot of it in a $100 Blue-Ray player now. Sound is very clear and understandable.Will post pix on [...]", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best TV I own!", "Author": "Patricia A. Loso", "ReviewID": "R12E7TW2Y3MZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded to this 37\" Vizio from a 26\" 3 ton monster in the bedroom. A few years ago I thought my DLP was a nice picture even next to a plasma, but this LED is really nice. I thought I needed a 120 refresh rate, but after researching, I found that on this 37\" I can't even tell the difference. The picture is better than watching a blue-ray disc.......especially when watching \"Monday Night Football\". This was my best choice to get a 37\" in a cabinet 36\" across. All of the others were a little wider than 36\", but this one was 34.7\" wide. A great TV and I don't have to angle it in the cabinet.........what more could one ask.?!!! I never even heard of Vizio until recently and I love it!", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV but watch out for the HDMI cable", "Author": "good story fan", "ReviewID": "R78SQEKCXVIMX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV and I'm enjoying it since I've had an HD video camera for more than 3 years now.  (Side note - if you have an HD camera you should at least get an HD display or make sure that your PC monitor can be set at the full HD resolution, if not an HDTV...you don't know what you're missing!)I love my tv but I have 2 cons:1. The place where the HDMI cable is connected is recessed so if the cable that you buy is too long (the \"plug\" part), it will not fit.  In my opinion, this is just poor design.  I had to measure that area and go back to the store to exchange the cable.2. I wish that the remote had more \"one press\" buttons for things like switching inputs (HDMI, DTV, AV, etc) and for turning the speakers off/on.  I know that there's a balance between too many options on the remote but I feel that these are used so often used that it becomes hassle.  I haven't tried to look for a universal remote so there may be an alternative.So the 2 cons are more nuisances than problems. No regrets with my tv!", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Looks great, well designed, well packed, no issues, recommended.", "Author": "Thomas A. Oehser \"Technologist Extraordinaire\"", "ReviewID": "R2HZCP5YLLSB93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV after returning an iSymphony LED32IF50 which had terrible color fidelity.  This TV is better in many, many ways.Setup: I'm running HDMI 1080P from a Zotac Zbox-Ad02-plus-U running Ubuntu Natty and Boxee to play content over gigE from a local media server.  I've only connected this TV with HDMI, and I stuck an antenna on the DTV to make sure it worked.  NOTA BENE: I'm not using the sound in the TV - I have the Zbox's TOSLINK digital sound output connected to a 5.1 receiver, so I am _not_ reviewing the audio / speakers - only the video / picture features.Pros: - Color fidelity and resolution is great, color bars and test patterns show the right hues and brightnesses. - There are enough options for overscan / zoom / wide stretch etc. to make source material correctly fill the screen. - The ergonomics of the connectors and stand are well thought out.  I had no issues at all. - I like having the ambient lighting sensor so that I don't find myself turning brightness up and down manually for day / night. - The stand is short enough to fit the TV in a 24\" vertical space, which was not true of most 37\" models. - The packaging was really sane, with removable clips that allowed the box to lift off, easier than any other I've seen.Cons: None really so far.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Spiney", "ReviewID": "R2CHO86L2XANS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got one of these from our local BJ's store as a tax-free weekend special here in Massachusetts.  It is a great TV for the money.  My wife, who doesn't normally comment on technology unless it doesn't work, loves it.  The viewing angle was the one thing that she noticed.  It is quite amazing, much better than our ancient (5 years old) plasma that we have in the TV room.The sound, even with all the SRS stuff, is not great, but it's as good as can be expected in a piece of equipment that is so thin, there's just not enough volume to provide a decent enclosure for the speakers.I have an Apple TV hooked up to it, and Netflix on that combination is amazing.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture, easy to use", "Author": "Cheryl A. Lux \"Cheryl A.\"", "ReviewID": "R258BF90TXU2CR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV came to us in short order, very well packaged, from the vendor.  We chose this model due to the positive reviews, and we don't need any internet or gaming features.  It was easy to set up, the included instructions were simple to follow.  The picture quality is so good at standard 480 that we decided to spring for the HD service from our satellite provider.  The sound is good, the speakers are located intelligently at the front of the set (instead of the back for so many models).  The 37 inch size fits neatly into our TV armoire, so it fits nicely into our living room.  I can understand why so many people want the movie quality sound surround systems to match the great picture quality of this set, but it would be just overkill in our smaller living room.This set is so great, the overall quality of TV programming doesn't do it justice.  Lots of bad TV programs out there--go Hulu/Netflix.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV at great price", "Author": "terrytogo", "ReviewID": "R5ULKTWLQMQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is crystal clear and is very cool for a 37\" tv.  We just recently purchased it about a month ago and have not had one single problem.

Nedwick", "ReviewID": "R3V802OQAIG67E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would say the only thing that I don't like about this TV is that it isn't 3D capable.  That being said, I don't think that a 37\" class TV is really the appropriate medium for a 3D movie- I think you need something at least 50\" to make that really worthwhile.  Besides that, I have no complaints.  It's light, easy to set up, has lots of settings that are easily adjusted, has excellent sound quality for purely internal speakers, and produces vibrant color.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "S. Trudeau \"sueszoo\"", "ReviewID": "RN17NXUDXTR4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our first flat-screen TV, we upgraded to this 37-inch from our 32-inch TV, which weighed a ton so that we had a lot of trouble moving it. Anyway, this TV is less than 35 inches wide so it fit well into our entertainment center, which is just over 35 inches. Mostly I picked this TV over others because it fit the space. Although that's not a really good reason, I do really like this TV for its other features.The screen is really clear, naturally an improvement over our old TV. This is even with our less-than-optimal hook-up. (Our components go through an old receiver/amplifier which doesn't have an HDMI port. Hooked this TV up using the method that doesn't give the best picture, using composite cables. Still, looks great to me.)  The installation went much smoother than I anticipated, I had no problems at all. The users' manual is pretty thorough; had no issues in programming the various features. Only one thing I don't like about this TV and that's when it powers on there's a screen with the word VIZIO on it. Only lasts for a few seconds but I could live without that. No big deal though.BTW, the connection ports are on the back of the TV and there are buttons on the side for things like volume, channel up/down etc. But these are all things you can do with the remote so you really don't have to access the sides for that. You can hook it up to a PC for photo slide-shows, but the port(s) for this are in the back of the TV.Besides the clear picture, the sound is good (even without piping it through our amplifier with the surround-sound speakers). Overall, I'm delighted with this purchase and would recommend it.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Tv", "Author": "Michelle Pressley", "ReviewID": "RU1SEOC5XL9CX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.

However, we encountered an issue that I thought is worth pointing out.  Just last night, the TV was bumped by my 4-yr old and fell.  It must have hit a corner of the table as it came down so there is a slight dent in the screen and the image is now all distorted.  I called a local repair shop and was told that the screen is not replaceable.  I was also told that this happens to many people even with much minor contact to the screen b/c the screen of most LED sets are not protected by anything.  He said that there may be some changes in the design in the future b/c of customer complains.  I wonder how often this happens to people and many people may not report it as they thought this was an user error.  Indeed it is, but for those with young children, you may want to take this into consideration when you buy a TV for the kids.
