{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very happy with my purchase. 240Hz is cool.", "Author": "A. Koziol", "ReviewID": "R31JAZGQ3SRF6J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my LN40B750 this past Friday and have now had all weekend to kick the tires and be amazed at its capabilities. I had already submitted a review, but not sure where it went.As I had stated in my now missing review, I am very impressed with this set's image quality and ease of use. Setup was pretty easy and only required me to fasten 4 screws to mount and lock the base to the bottom of the set. Connected the optical out to my receiver (Yamama RX-V750) and ran my DVD player's component cables right into the set. Now, I can finally enjoy progressive scan mode. What a HUGE difference that made! One thing I have to address is a negative comment made by another person who was complaining of stereo output from the optical out jack, instead of 5.1 surround sound. This is 100% contingent on what the broadcaster is pushing out, NOT the TV. Yes Jimmy, the evening news ONLY needs to be in plain vanilla stereo, not 5.1 surround sound. I can confirm that it does push out L/R stereo on the evening news and certain other broadcasts. Some broadcasts caused only my center channel to push out audio while others gave me L/C/R output so don't blame Samsung at all if you're getting stereo or 3-channel output. Watching ZOOM last night made all 5.1 channels on my receiver light up like a Christmas tree. I am so thrilled to watch some of my favorite shows in 5.1 now.So, one of the main reasons I bought this was because of the 240Hz processing and 2ms response time, and, on my wife's recommendation, the panel design. 240Hz processing it is both neat and surreal. Other reviewers have stated that it give the picture a sort of Soap Opera-like effect but I would have to say no to this assessment. When I think of Soap Opera, I think of very apparent action happening on a stage/set with poor or harsh lighting and shadows: sort of campy. I can see where people liken it to that but it's not quite accurate. When enabled and set to its \"Standard\" mode, 240Hz processing makes certain fast-moving scenes seem very fluid, almost as if it were a live feed/broadcast not too dissimilar to reality TV. It gives motion a more smooth appearance as it is being displayed on screen. When I turned this Friday's episode of Numb3rs on, there was a bus chase scene that looked like it was coming from a live TV broadcast. Turning off 240Hz processing made it seem like \"produced\" TV does. I am now convinced and a convert to what 240Hz processing can do for TV. I decided to try it out on a DVD: Princess Mononoke. Wow! Some scenes looked like real-time 3D without 3D glasses. I am impressed. It takes a bit of getting used to but even my wife commented on how 3D some scenes appeared and how almost TOO real it makes the image look. She admits she is now addicted to this set. Also, I happened to turn the channel to see an old episode of 1960s Batman and it looked like a live broadcast! Neat but a bit weird. Overall, I think 240Hz processing is just an augmentation to what is already there.I also have to discuss blockiness with certain scenes and fast moving action: I have thus far encountered NONE. When I have watched football or some other fast-moving stuff on other people LCD panels, all I saw was blocks and digital artifacting and that always turned me off to LCD. I get none of that with this set so far. I put on a baseball game, Olympic re-run highlights, smooth as silk. Not sure if it's because I am running RG6 cabling throughout my house but I am here to attest that the blockiness I hate on LCDs is not present on this set. A+ for that Samsung.I was also worried about screen glare and reflection with this set as it DOES come with Ultra Clear Panel. I have a large window that faces opposite the set and when off, I can see a reflection. BUT! When the set it on, it's all business and NO glare. Try as I might, I see no glare or reflection. That is impressive. Kudos to Samsung (and the 150000:1 contrast probably helps too!).The Touch of Grey is cool, no more illuminated border. I was also happy to play around with the widgets and other little built-in goodies. The built-in Ethernet jacks lets you plug it into a router or whatever to perform firmware updates and download new stuff to the widgets section. My wife LOVES the Art widget that displays Monet images to serene piano music. Some think this is gimmicky stuff, I think it's a GREAT example of convergence. A+ to Samsung for this stuff. I was also pleased to receive the full LN40B750 manual with my set. I wonder if people were upset by Samsung going green and putting the manual on a USB stick and built-in to the TV? I think it's smart as opposed to trying to dig up where the manual went.My only gripe with the set is not being able to cycle through the inputs (Video 1, Video 2, Component 1, HDMI 1, etc.) by just depressing the button. While the TV's GUI menu system is nice, I hate using a GUI to navigate to the input I want to use. I'm old-school and like to cycle through the inputs. It would be nice if changing input methods (GUI versus multiple button depressions) was an option in the settings somewhere. The remote is pretty standard and sleek and doesn't have the dial that I have heard so many complain about. It may be that Samsung went back a bit and just kept things simple with a standard button layout you'd find on most any TV remote. On a scale of 1-10, this set is a solid 9.5 for me. You would be happy with its many options. 240Hz may not be for everyone but it is cool in my book. If you are considering the LN40B650, you will be happy spending the extra $ on this set for the 2ms response time and 240Hz processing.Just a couple things I forgot to mention in the original review. Although Samsung's web page says there are no USB ports, mine has two on the right side labeled USB 1 (HDD) and USB 2. It IS an Ultra Clear Panel but Samsung's page says it is not. It was printed right on the box. Although the Samsung firmware upgrade guide says to download and extract firmware to a USB drive and plug it into the back of the TV, there is no USB on the back of the TV, only the right side. Someone asked if the remote is backlit and yes, it is. There's a button on the top of the remote that illuminates the buttons in the dark.UPDATE: 8/3/2009After downloading and installing the 1008 firmware update (my model shipped with the 1006 version), I feel the TV is a bit more responsive for channel switching. The widgets and goodies load up a bit faster too. I cannot find any concrete info on what the new firmware contains. Updating to the new firmware does allow you to revert back to the old firmware in the TV setup. That's VERY important in case of a firmware bug. Way to go Samsung! I will update this review if any future firmware updates improve this already great TV.UPDATE: 9/8/2009TV is still working great. I have to add that I do not experience the so called \"blue-ish blacks\" that some others have reported. I have properly calibrated my contrast and brightness levels so I get deep blacks on many of the shows I watch. Also, I have to add that when I did a channel scan, the NTSC tuner was still grabbing things out there. It picked up a couple of music channels broadcasting over NTSC so that was kind of a surprise. I guess the NTSC and ATSC tuners work in tandem.UPDATE: 9/18/2009Today I updated the firmware to revision 1011 and a few new features were added. The \"HD Conection Guide\" is new which shows you the inputs and connections. And there is a menu item called \"Contact Samsung\" which has web site info and phone numbers along with model code and software version. Sadly, this firmware erases all your settings so make sure and write them down before you update!UPDATE: 9/22/2009On 9/18 I updated to 1011 firmware via the Internet. I just went to the Samsung web site and saw that 1012.3 is available. Going to update and see what new stuff got added or fixed.UPDATE: 9/25/2009I have to say that when I updated to the 1011 firmware, I felt that the image quality somehow suffered or was reduced because I noticed a lot of jaggies and such when material was 480i, 720p, and sometimes 1080i material, whereas it used to be smooth or fairly sharp in general. After the update to 1012.3 firmware, I feel like the picture has returned to being very sharp all around no matter what the source material. Seems channel switching is also a tad bit faster with the 1012.3 update. It also didn't reset my settings to factory default which is nice. I've written my settings down just in case. Glad Samsung continues to fine tune the performance of this TV. Keep it coming.UPDATE: 10/14/2009: I successfully played an XVid movie using Media Play and it functions *almost* like a TiVo---not that I own one but have seen them. Very cool! I didn't realize it but there are firmware release notes! Never noticed they were there before but if you visit Samsung's site and find your model TV, click Support & Downloads, click Firmware, and then click the \"Upgrade File\" link under the description, it tells you what's been fixed.For 1012.3:a. This Firmware will support some strange resolution or Codec.. Resolution : DTV 320 x 240. Codec : MPEG2 - TS (on Media Play)b. Samsung launches new widgets for Internet@TV. Blockbuster on Demand, Rally Cast, Ebay, and many more. To get more information, visit ''News & Alerts'' on [...]c. Add some menu on Media Play. ''Repeat'' Menu (on Media Play)d. This Firmware will correct the following phenomenons some units may experience.. When viewing 1080i formatted signals through the Component Input, the picture is intermittently jumping up and down.. Intermittent No Sound on 1080p when connecting with some Unit through HDMI.. When viewing 720p or 1080i formatted signals through the Component Input, the picture is intermittently flickering.. When viewing some resolution (720 x 1440i) signals with Set-Top Box, ''Not Supported Message'' may appear on the screen.UPDATE: 10/16/2009: Updated to firmware 1013 today via Internet. No info about it yet on Samsung's site. Will update if they post release notes.UPDATE: 12/4/2009: Updated to firmware 1016 today via Internet. No info about it yet on Samsung's site. Will update if they post release notes.UPDATE: 1/12/2010: It seems all traces of the LN40B750 have been pulled from Samsung's site. I was there last week and today gone. WTF? If you type in the keyword LN40B750 in the site search it down show a link to the Downloads section where you can find manuals and such. Not good Samsung, not good.UPDATE: 1/21/2010: Updated to firmware 1017 today via Internet. No info about it yet on Samsung's site. Will update if they post release notes.UPDATE: 2/1/2010: Ok, in my original review I stated that glare was not a problem. In my case, this was in mid July and my red maple was providing shade behind my West-facing window so noon and setting sun were not so bad. Being that it is now midwinter and the tree is bare, I had the experience of the setting sun full on in my TV room and yes, there was glare IF I sat perpendicular to BOTH the TV and the window. However, when I sat a few feet to either side, the TV was more bright enough to overpower ANY glare (and I have my contrast and brightness turned much lower than factory settings). To be fair, if there is REALLY bright light, yes you may experience glare. The 32\" Sony that this TV replaced was unwatchable for us during this time of the year or at least until the sun set. Still very impressive.UPDATE: 2/8/2010: Since the new Blu-Ray 3D standard (via HDMI 1.4) will be here shortly in the form of the Samsung BD-C6900 (HDMI 1.4!), you'll want to know that Blu-Ray 3D REQUIRES a TV with, supposedly, a minimum of 120Hz processing for it to work but I read it was 240Hz. Can't find the article now though. So even though the LN40B750 is HDMI 1.3 compliant and true Blu-Ray 3D requires HDMI 1.4, it WILL work with HDMI 1.3 but at 1080i (from what I can tell (high quality Category 2 cables are also a requirement)). Seems most Blu-Ray 2.0 players, if firmware upgradable, can support Blu-Ray 3D but at the HDMI 1.3 spec level. Can't remember if response time helps though. The Samsung 3D Blu-Ray player is right around the corner and I would not be surprised if Avatar 3D (Director's Cut?) comes out around the same time. Again, 100% glad I spent a few extra dollars on my set to be able to take advantage of this new standard! After all the years of 3D failing on lo-def analog TV, I think today's HD TVs will finally get us over the hump. To be continued...UPDATE: 3/9/2010: In response to a negative review of this TV with respect to audio sync issues, I for one have never experienced this issue and in all fairness, who knows what the person who wrote that comment had in terms of connections and hardware. The reviewer also references the A750 series, not B750 and this alleged audio sync would have been MUCH more widely reported. I have not heard of any such problem. It's unclear if the person tried to update their firmware either.UPDATE: 4/12/2010: Haven't seen any firmware updates in a few months. I hope Samsung hasn't stopped supporting this awesome set. You know why? Because last night I discovered yet ANOTHER amazing thing about this TV. I had been waiting for months to see a foreign film by a director I love and it was recently released but not subtitled in English. I found the subtitles online in the form of an SRT file. On a whim, I named the subtitle file and the movie file the same thing (minus the extension of course) and copied them to my USB drive and plugged it in to the TV. Guess what? I got to watch the movie and the subtitles were recognized and worked PERFECTLY. THAT is AMAZING! I wish I could give 6 stars because now I no longer have to waste blank DVDs! Yet another A+ to you Samsung.UPDATE: 8/3/2010: I was very disappointed to see some idiot give the set a negative review because it didn't have Netflix built into it. Jeez, do research much?UPDATE: 8/28/2010 #2: Looks like firmware 1018 added MKV support. FINALLY! Another reason why this TV rocks, rocks, rock!UPDATE: 6/2/2011: TV is still going strong. Mine has not died like others appear to have. What are these people doing to this set to kill it so early?? To the reviewer who cried about a 240Hz picture (Auto Motion Plus) being fluid (like \"Copy\"), he's obviously been living in a cave with his $40,000 analog monitor and clueless about 21st century technology. Please. Just because something costs $40k doesn't mean it's actually worth it. Too bad he didn't read the manual as he would have known that you can turn off Motion Plus and go back to 60Hz-land. But why?UPDATE: 8/7/2011: So you never got around to getting yourself a Samsung WiFi adapter for this TV but you think the cost of the Samsung WiFi adapter is outrageous? You ain't alone. Samsung's WiFi adapter is just a rebranded adapter with two specific WiFi chips in it: The Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820. It is now well know in the Samsung community that all you need to do is buy a WiFi adapter with those two chips in them and it will work at 1/4 the price. Here's a list of WiFi adapters that have the Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820 and should work just fine:EnGenius EUB-9701 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820AboCom WU5200 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Aceex NU22 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Airlink AWLL6080 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Airlink AWLL7025 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850Allnet ALL0233EXT Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Alpha Networks WUS-N02 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Alpha Networks WUS-ND02 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850AmbiCom WL600N-USB Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850Asus USB-N11 Ralink RT2870 Realtek RT2820Asus WL-160N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Belkin F5D8051 v3 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Belkin F5D8053 v1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Belkin F5D8055 v1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Buffalo WLI-UC-AG300N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850Buffalo WLI-UC-G300HP Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Buffalo WLI-UC-G300N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Buffalo WLP-UC-AG300 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850Cameo WLAN-1501 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850Cameo WLN-1502 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820CenDyne JR300N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820CNet CWD-905 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Conceptronic C300RU v1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820D-Link DWA-110 rev B Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820D-Link DWA-140 rev B1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820D-Link DWA-140 rev C1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820D-Link DWA-160 rev B1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850DrayTek Vigor N61 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Edimax EW-7718Un Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Encore ENUWI-N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820EnGenius EUB-9701 EXT2 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Gemtek WUBR-208N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850Gigabyte GN-WB30N-RH Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Hawking HWDN1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Hawking HWUN1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820LevelOne WNC-0600USB v2 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820LG-Nortel UAP300N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Linksys WUSB600N v1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850Netronix W423B Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Newer Technology MXP802NU2C Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Planex GW-USMini2N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820PRO-NETS WU81RL Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Rokland RokN Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Rosewill RNX-N1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Rosewill RNX-N2X Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Samsung WIS09ABGN Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850SIIG CN-WR0212-S1 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850Sitecom WL-329 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850SMC SMCWUSB-N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820SparkLAN WUBR-505N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850TRENDnet TEW-664UB Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850U-MEDIA WUB-370L Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Unex DNUR-81 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820Z-Com XN-790 Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820ZyXEL NWD210N Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2820ZyXEL NWD-211AN Ralink RT2870 Ralink RT2850", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture,  No red bezel!", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "RB76G22RILQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow!  This panel is really amazing.  I have been researching sets for several months.  It came down to the Sony XBR6 and the Samsung A650.  Quite frankly I loved the Samsung picture but could not really accept the red \"Touch of Color\" bezels...  just a personal choice I guess.  Anyways,  I purchased the Sony a few weeks ago on clearance and thought I was getting a great deal.  Unfortunately the picture on the Sony was a real let down.  It seemed dull and dim (even after adjusting the settings several times per different recommendations online and turning off the auto-dimming setting).  My old DLP set even seemed crisper when I compared them side by side which was just not acceptable.  Perhaps I got a bunk panel but after googling \"dim XBR6\" it seems like several people noticed the same thing I did.I started doing more research and noticed that Amazon started carrying this television within the last week or two.  Samsung must have caught on that they were losing sales due to their red color fetish as this panel is a beautiful dark shade of gray.  Anyways, the XBR was returned and this panel replaced it.  It's as clean crisp and clear as you could imagine from a non LED backlit panel.  Its like night and day between this set and the Sony.  The action is clear and crisp and the picture is just impressive.  I highly recommend this panel,  it is absolutely the clearest picture around without paying the huge premium for an LED set.  You will not regret going with this TV.  The only negative I would mention is that the panel is fairly reflective compared to the Sony.  Definitely not an issue when the set is on but when turned off its definitely noticable.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "A very good LCD set, with some useless extras", "Author": "Crispers", "ReviewID": "RMGBMVQUQTQMR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I shopped around quite a bit before deciding on this set, and now that it's in the house, I would most certainly purchase again. I'll keep this short and sweet:THE GOOD- Absolutely stunning picture quality, with a wide array of picture adjustment options. As with any LCD/Plasma, though, be prepared to spend some time adjusting these settings depending on input source, room conditions, and personal preference.- User menu is well organized, easy to understand, and overall responds quickly to input commands.- The set itself is very attractive. The glossy black finish and charcoal grey ToC compliment my other equipment nicely - much more appealing than the red ToC found on other Samsung sets. Also, the stand allows the TV to rotate, which is a plus.- The 240 Hz refresh rate is nice, but not as big of an improvement as 120 Hz is over 60 Hz.THE BAD- Almost useless network connectivity. With the notable exception of being able to connect to the internet for product updates and support, I find few good things to say about Samsung's networking interface. Being able to view pictures/listen to music/watch movies over a home network is nice, but having this capability built into a TV set is redundant at present. In my case, I have my computer connected through a long DVI -> HDMI cable, so using Samsung's clunky networking interface to access a limited amount of my media is pointless. Several other companies have this same technology in their TV sets, but it seems not a one of them has figured out how to implement a truly useful product for accessing media content on a home network (largely due to paranoia over content rights). Ho hum.- Internet widgets are slow. As there exist other ways of accessing the same content/services that aren't nearly as slow, I can't see really using them. Good idea, poor execution....but could get better in time through firmware updates.As I stated earlier, I would definitely purchase this set again. I did travel to my local BB to compare, and to my eye, I found the LNB750 series a cut above most of the others on display. I did not have high expectations for the networking capabilities, and unfortunately you are paying for it (most other similar Samsung series seem to have the same networking capabilities, so no luck there). It is somewhat irksome to have to pay for features that are either useless or poorly designed, but the picture quality and overall performance of the LN40B750 make it a worthy purchase.", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV", "Author": "DeeJaye6 \"- DeeJaye6\"", "ReviewID": "R1WVHFWA919S8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched HD TVs for several months before finally deciding on the LN40B750, and I am very, very glad that I waited and got such a good television.  Many factors went into this decision:1. The TV is for my bedroom, so I didn't want one larger than 40\".  - This requirement took the Samsung LED 240Hz TVs out of the running, since they only offer those in 46\" and 55\" at this time2. I had gone to many, many retail stores to see the screens with my own eyes.  I went to so many stores because one store may have the Sony set up to be superior while another might favor the Vizio, while yet a third may favor Samsung.  I found the Samsung to have a very clear, crisp picture very comparable to the Sony, but with a lower price point.  I also found the Samsung to have a better picture than the Visio.  (I also preferred the layout of Samsung's remote over that of the Visio.)3. I wanted a 1080P, 240Hz, 100K+:1 contrast ratio with lots of HDMI and component inputs.The LN40B750 hit the money on all marks.  It is a very pretty TV, with a shiny, easy-to-clean finish (it even comes with a micro-fiber cleaning cloth), and a gorgeous stand, if you don't want to drill holes in your wall.  The 240Hz picture (as others have said) takes a little getting used to.  I tuned into USA HD once I had the TV on the stand I bought and hooked it up to my FiOS box and started watching \"U-571\" in HD.  Funny thing: it didn't look right.  In fact, it looked as if someone was putting on a live production of the movie.  Everything was so crisp and clear, and the movements were so smooth, the entire movie ended up looking as if it were live!  Two days later, I visited my father who has an older Sony HD TV (60Hz) and he put his HDDVD copy of U-571 in for me to compare.  There was no comparison.  As clear as his TV is, it didn't hold a candle to the quality of the picture on the Samsung.The menus are very, very easy to follow and comprehend.  I do not care for the melody the TV makes when I turn it on or off, nor did I want that little light on the bottom to be on while I watch TV.  Both were incredibly easy to disable.  It is also child's play to bring up the menu for adjusting the video settings such as judder, though I have not yet found reason to adjust them.So far, I have watched several HD movies, 4 football games in HD, and about a dozen shows filmed in HD.  Only the CBS HD broadcast gave me any reason to complain, and I understand that is because of their 1080i cameras.  Fox, NBC, and ESPN apparently all use 720P cameras which are vastly superior.  (Every time CBS switched to their on-the-field cameras, the entire picture ended up artifacted for a few seconds.  Also, whereas I could have counted the blades of grass on the field on the other three channels, CBS' picture was too fuzzy to make out that kind of detail.)Lastly are the inputs.  Ho-lee!  *Four* HDMI inputs (three on the back, one on the right side as you face the TV)!!  Four!  Also, two dedicated component inputs, 1 dedicated composite input, and 1 component/composite input!  Add to that the RF and PC (VGA) inputs, and its ability to display pics or videos off a USB drive and there is nothing you cannot play on this TV!I will update this review later after I have hooked up my X-Box 360 and tried out some of the 1080P games, and after I get a wireless LAN antenna and update the TV.Oh, one last point: I'd read in a few reviews here about the manual coming on a flash drive.  Well, I bought my TV directly from Amazon (not a third party) and I got an actual book for my manual.  Not sure what to make of that.===UPDATE - 2 December 2009===Okay!  The X-Box 360 cinches it!  It is be-a-utiful!  The 1080p is evident in everything I do on the system that supports that resolution, from the menus to simple games like \"Castle Crashers,\" to more complex games like Forza Motorsports.  Clean, crisp, and smoooooth!I also have purchased a Samsung BD-P3600 Blu-ray player.  This was a good purchase to go with the TV, as the remote for the player (of course) also works on the TV, and the BD-Wise enables the TV to automatically detect that the BD has turned on, and it switches the input!  Niiice!  The TV also turns on automatically if I turn on the BD.  The picture is out of this world, I don't mind telling you!  (I'll probably post a review of the player on that unit's page in a few weeks.)Now, I have noticed that the reflective screen will show *very* bright lights even with the TV on, but they have to be pretty darn bright.  Even then, it's not too bad.  I also found out that the video processor on this TV is a 10-bit processor, which is fairly good.  It's not the best one out there, but then again, I'm not seeing any pixelization aside from the NFL on CBS, so I'm not sure if the 14-bit TVs I've read about are all that much better or not.  I leave it to you to decide that.  I'm happy with the LN40B750, myself, and I hope this review has helped you!===UPDATE - 5 March 2010===Still loving the TV, but I have discovered one negative and I'm hoping Samsung will provide a way to turn this off.  The screen auto-dims on dark scenes, presumably to get the super blacks that LED sets give.  Where this falls short is when I'm watching a show or a movie with a dark scene (say, \"Planet Earth\" showing a cave scene).  Invariably, the TV drops the brightness, and now I can't even see what the show is trying to show me.I wish there were an option to turn this off.

Sports events are the best -- you get a great picture and colors on SD, then when you switch over to HD, the grass is not only green but you can count the blades of grass!I was in a chat room with one of the geek service guys, just verifying how I would hook up TiVo and various components; he asked what TV I'd purchased and when I told him, he said, \"That Samsung is a NICE television!\"  He's right!The only downsides I saw in consumer reviews were a couple of minor complaints about sound variation (I think going from SD to HD).  There might be a very little of that, so geez, turn the volume up!  It's not a problem.One pointer.  The HDMI cable that comes with the set is a low-end bronze conductor.  It works perfectly well, but if you need to buy HDMI cables anyway for your components, get the gold ones on line.  I bought mine through Amazon for $6.99 each.  (Forget Monster cables, I think you're just paying way extra for the name.)  Do the gold conductor HDMI cables work better?  I dunno, but I feel better having \"top of the line\" and you can't beat the price.Final thought.  I was a little apprehensive about buying such a big ticket item on line.

Incredible picture and realistic movement (240Hz)--almost too good, since the movement of the camera, especially if hand-held for certain scenes is so distinct that it can sometimes be distracting, with all the \"jarring\" that happens during the filming. So, if that might bother you, stick w/120 Hz or less. We also own the LN40A550, which is also a great set but the jarring isn't as obvious, I think because it's only 60 Hz but great TV too & completely problem-free so far. Might even be nicer with larger than 40\" screen.Caveat: Had LN40B750 about 2 months when picture completely disappears when turn on--now waiting on in-home (warranteed, thankfully) repair next week, which I'm anticipating will result in all being well.  Since it's relatively new on market, I am not completely upset about some potential bugs needing to be worked out and still give this tv a high rating--could probably say 5 stars, but will need to see what happens once repaired.Other pros: I like touch of gray--wasn't too into the red of other models.  Screen is slightly shiny but not a problem, despite light from windows, which was a concern prior to seeing it in real life.  BTW, you can set it so that the light at the bottom can be on or off, for those who are wondering and might not like that.

I spent a significant amount of time online looking at reviews and going to stores to see the TV and its competition in person.  I'll break it down with the okay, the good, and the great (I have nothing bad to say about this TV or anything with Amazon or delivery).The Okay:Widgets are slow to load in particular when loading YouTube video.  I ran a network cable to the TV instead of spending the $80 on the wireless adapter.  This is negated by being able to watch TV while they are loading but it is definitely not a click and go at Internet speeds.  I have not yet installed the software on my home PC for photo viewing so I cannot weigh in on that yet.  I do like that they offer Amazon VOD which I have not yet used but to plan to (Blockbuster VOD is also offered).  It is disappointing that Netflix is not an available Widget and hope that this is corrected soon.  The news and sports widgets are okay at best.  You can get headlines but you can't get the rest of the story.  I also think that the sports widgets should allow you to pick teams to follow and have their scores, schedules and news items available similar to setting up the weather widget (another one where you probably have 10 other quicker choices for a forecast).Picture in picture is not usable for folks with a set top box and Samsung's implementation is not the best.  It does only work on the direct input to the TV (i.e. it does not work through the HDMI inputs).The Good:The ultra clear panel looks good and the TOC with Grey is a much nicer than the Red on the 120Hz TV.  I keep it as good and not great for the following reasons.  The bezel is very thick compared to the competitive Sony.  I really like the thin set bezel of the Sony.  The Sony looks like a much larger picture than the Samsung due to the bezel.  However the Samsung gloss finish especially on the screen creates a better look and picture in my eyes.  It will create a glare from lighting and windows.  This was a problem with the glass CRTs too though and is easily overcome here.  The TV has plenty of contrast to overcome most any glare.  Our set has both lamps and south windows directly opposite the TV and we have no issues during the day with glare.  Lamps and the sun do reflect off the shiny bezel though so you may find that distracting.This set also does a good job with non-HD video such as VHS (my complaint here is lack of a Super Video input).The set is thin but is obviously not as thin as the LED back lit models.  However in spending a lot of time in front of both at the store, the picture quality of this model relative to the EDGE lit LED TVs is clearly superior.  Now if you really want great picture quality move up to the true BACK Lit LED models.  Blacks there look like a plasma but you are going to pay for that step up.  This is the best picture quality of any LCD TV I have seen including the Sony XBR TVs.The Great:The color level and picture are fantastic.  I feel the settings out of the box are great.  However, CNet provides some nice tweaks to the movie settings which I have used with a Sony PS3 to show a fantastic picture though I didn't spend time going back and forth to see how much different it was from the factory settings.  I like that each input can be adjusted to the settings you want.  For example my PS3 retains the movie settings (tweaked per CNet) while my Digital Set top Box is set to Standard, etc.Automotion Plus creates a beautiful picture.  I don't think the 240Hz by itself offers anything over the 120Hz so don't buy this set on that alone.  The Grey color pushed me up to this TV.  That said sporting events in HD look FANTASTIC.  The configuration of how the Automotion is a nice touch and there are built in configurations that allow you to tune for the event you are watching.  It does create an almost live feel for normal programming but that can be compensated by adjusting the settings or by turning it off.For those leery of online ordering, Amazon and the delivery company were both great.  Delivery was fast and friendly.  This is my second TV that I have ordered online.  The first being a 46\" Samsung DLP several years ago.Overall this is a fantastic TV and Amazon beats everyone that I found on price including Crutchfield.

I found out on CNET and on the Consumer Affairs website that hundreds of customers who have purchased Samsung LCD TV's have had this same problem, and many other serious problems, mostly occurring shortly after the one-year warranty expires.  It sounds as though Samsung has been producing televisions which have major problems since 2007 or 2008 and has not corrected the problems in their newer sets.

This is by far the best tv out of them all!  I'm not going to go into every single specification because the most important thing on a tv is really the picture quality.  I just want to give my 2 cents that this TV made tv watching incredibly enjoyable.  I have an HD projector on a 90\" screen and I found myself favoring this TV instead.  The picture quality is really like looking at something live through a glass window, it is just so real!  The 240hz makes everything so incredibly life-like.  As a photographer I am a picture perfectionist and I drive my wife crazy making minor adjustments to the video quality all the time.  I hardly found myself playing with the adjustments because I was too enthralled with the picture quality to ever notice.  The channels change very quickly, a pet peeve of mine on many other slower tuners.  I sold this TV (at a profit!) because I thought I'd be able to get something better down the road (like LED).

I got two LN40C630s and the first one had a bit of ghosting problems as well as a few dead pixels. Returned and got a replacement from Amazon in which I have to commend them on the fast delivery of the second one. I noticed the colors were a bit washed out on this replacement one, and the ghosting was still there. I saw the Samsung LN40B750 which is last years model (2009) and the price was a bit more than the newer C630 so I said with skeptisism, let me try it. WOW, the difference on the picture is like night and day. Compared to the C630, the B750's picture quality is one of the best I've seen. Very clear picture right out of the box, the detail in HD sources like channels and PS3/Xbox 360 is amazing. No washed out colors and did not notice any ghosting. This tv also has built in apps, in which I have not tried yet because I have to run a lan wire through (Will update review once I do). The bezel is a bit longer at the bottom as well as a longer clear neck on the tv stand compared to the C630. Sports a thin hardly noticeable gray line (Touch of Color) and has a light at the bottom of the Samsung logo which can be set to on or off. This lcd has no flashlight problems that I can notice. The screen is a glossy one, which some people might not like because glare can distract from viewing. But to me, the glossy picture makes the colors more vibrant for some reason.One of the negatives I have is with the remote control. It feels like I have to really press the buttons in for input. I also have to say that I did notice minimal lag when using the smooth motion flow. No matter how much dejudder or blurr I set, smooth or standard, on running score/info messages like on ESPN it gave me a bit of lag. Setting to off takes care of the lag at keast. There is also a tiny bit of lag between inputs when gaming. I was playing Call of Duty and felt like I had to work a bit more with the controls for some reason. Nothing too bad, but you can notice it a bit. I hear Game mode will help with it, but did not see much of a difference with the exception of the colors looking a bit more vibrant and darker.Aside from those small cons, I will be keeping this one.

Just a fantastic television.Cons: Can't think of any real cons.  Is a dust magnet but could care less when it is so amazing.Other: Make sure to turn on Game Mode when playing XBOX or PS3 or there will be a significant delay between controller movements.

I know that sounds strange, but it looks more like video than film. But it is easy to adjust by the sets own presets OR it allows you to adjust it to your liking with a custom setting that allows you to adjust the anti-blur and the anti-judder feature.Looks outstanding with HD cable TV, BluRay, PS3 and Xbox 360.

Van Horne \"skeptic\"", "ReviewID": "R3TF8D86L37LVG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've worked in a telecine facility, for the last 20 years, supervising the transfer of film to video tape.  I'm used to watching video on $40,000 monitors.  When my home 35\" JVC CRT died recently, I knew it was time to buy a flat screen tv.  I didn't expect it to look like a professional monitor.  But from all the glowing reviews I read here, I thought it would look pretty great.  After all, technology has been rapidly evolving, right?  It should at least look as good as my 13 year old CRT!  How wrong I was.  This monitor makes everything look like video!  The whites clip, the blacks are crushed and there is no motion blur.  Everything looks like an episode of Cops!  I purchased a monitor alignment disc and spend 4 hours with my blu ray machine, trying to make a decent picture.  But it sucks.  Even though I do this for a living, I can't make it look good.  I will hire somebody who has tools that I don't, like a probe to read the screen to see if the picture can be improved and if it can, I will remove this negative review.  But as of right now, here is my honest opinion: If you want accurate color, if you want slight detail in the blacks, if you want to see detail in the sky, in short, if you want feature films to look like feature films, don't buy this set.  The picture is absolute garbage!Update August 3, 2011 I see the that the reviewer A. Koziol, who loved this set, slammed me for not accepting new technology.  If accepting new technology means thinking a digital camera captures a better image than a 70mm film camera, or believing that \"high definition\" paint at Home Depot must be better than regular paint, then I guess you're right.  For the record, I never expected this set to equal the 40K monitors at my work.  I just wanted something better or at least equal to my 35\" JVC CRT.  And even where I work, we are having to switch over to Panasonic Plasmas, because nobody is making tube sets anymore.In tests conducted by the ASC, people shown material shot at a higher frame rate, could see a greater difference in the material than the difference between 2K and 4K images.  Showscan, which was invented by Douglas Trumball 20+ years ago, was based on shooting 70mm film at 60 frames per second.However, I still prefer to see films the way the filmmakers shot them.  If watching Casablanca at 240hz makes it a better movie to you, great.  In fact, I will applaud ANYTHING that keeps you busy, on screen or otherwise, rather than having to read your fifty updates to your review.  In other words, get a life!UPDATE DECEMBER 2011  THE TV STOPPED WORKING, TWO WEEKS AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED!!!  It cost me over $300.00 to replace a circuit board in the set.  I contacted Samsung and asked if they would pay for it, because most televisions shouldn't need repairs after owning them only 54 weeks.
