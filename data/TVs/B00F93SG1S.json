Definitely look up the coverage area at Dyle.tv before buying this product to see what channels are available where you live because not all broadcast stations send their signal through Dyle.  Also, if you couldn't get TV with rabbit ears, this won't work for you either -- the signal is being picked up from the station's broadcast tower, not through the cellular network.  That said, I can fire it up, throw it on my window sill and watch live TV  from my iPad anywhere in my apartment without racking up data charges.  Just gotta do some research first at Dyle.tv.  Happy TV viewing!", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Fine Print", "Author": "ManOfManyInterests", "ReviewID": "R1N1UMME0QLATG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product works as advertised if you use a later generation tablet or cell phone. It did not work with an IPad 1 but it did work with an IPad 3 and with a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 inch model. It also worked well with my Samsung Galaxy Note II cell phone.  There are 5 stations available in my area that are accessible with the Dyle box. All of them gave a crystal clear picture most of the time no matter what part of the metro area I tested them except for one station that worked 80% of the time. (I live in suburban Cincinnati)You are probably thinking why did this guy give the thing 3 stars if it worked as well as he said it did? I'll tell you what they are not telling you based on my personal experience. Dyle TV does not have broadcasting rights to rebroadcast NFL football. I tried to watch 3 different games the weekend that I had it. All of them were blacked out. One channel broadcasted their alternative weather channel during the game. The other channel had a static banner up the entire game stating that Dyle TV did not have rebroadcasting rights. One channel did broadcast pregame highlights but the picture became very pixelated every time they showed game highlights. I also heard on my local news station that the Dyle TV service is currently free but they (Dyle) reserve the rights to charge for the service in the future. Perhaps someone from Dyle can comment on this.I would guess that the native resolution of Dyle TV is something around 640 x 360 pixels. This means that the signal is less than high definition which would have to be at least 1280 X 720 to be 720p. There is a picture resize tool in their application which allows you to view channels in their native resolution. The native resolution on some channels yielded a picture that was about 1/8 the size of my cell phone which is tiny. I would expect that the thing would be able to rebroadcast in high definition on a phone or tablet that has the capability to replay a signal in 1080p.I'm not trying to badmouth or bash this product. It does work and it is watchable. The picture stayed almost perfectly synced with the sound all the time. It works as advertised. My deal breakers were the lack of high definition and no NFL rebroadcast on Sundays which were enough for me to send it back. It is also too expensive in my opinion. I can buy a RCA DPTM70R 7-Inch 60Hz TV right here on Amazon for $15 less than this unit and have a 7 inch TV that will get all the broadcast NFL games in my area and I don't have to worry about the battery on my phone running down. I will also get many more channels with the RCA TV vs. Dyle. The RCA will receive all of the broadcast stations in my area. (44 channels) The Dyle unit only gets 5. From what I understand, my area has more Dyle stations than most so you should check to see what you are going to get before you buy this. Don't assume you will get all of the stations in your area because you won't.Also beware that the audiovox unit is about the size of half a pack of cigarettes if you would cut it in half top to bottom. I would think that it would be very easy to loose. I would suggest to Audiovox that they put some sort of thingy on the box so you can attach it to a lanyard or a key ring so you don't loose the thing.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works Great!", "Author": "SW Florida Info Tech", "ReviewID": "R3RCP4XY70J4I7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works as advertised.

I tested this product on an Ipad 4 and Droid Razr Maxx HD Android smartphone and it works on both devices. You must download the proper app to use it (Dyle mobile TV app by Siano). Note: When you connect with the receiver from the settings on the Ipad you will not see the Wi-Fi connected symbol in the notification bar on top. I was able to test it in two different markets, in Phoenix and Charlotte. Both markets had five stations that you were able to pick up. However, one of the reasons I got this product was to watch NFL games on CBS and NBC on Sundays, but the channel would not broadcast the game, only an alternate HD channel was shown. According to other reviews, it is an issue of rights between the NFL and Dyle TV. I hope that this issue will be resolved, since it would be nice to watch NFL playoffs and the Super Bowl on your mobile device. I hope that someone from Dyle TV could comment on this and see if this would ever happen.When you do view a channel in the app, the screen is mediocre at best. (I do have an over the air HDTV antenna at home (no cable), which the picture comes in high definition and really clear.) On the Ipad you can see the channel, but it gets pixelated at times and no where near the quality of the picture of my regular TV that receives regular HDTV signals. I understand that this is due to the mobile tv signal from Dyle not broadcast in HD, but at a lower resolution to accommodate all mobile devices. It's too bad, because it would be nice to see the Dyle tv signal in full HD in a Retina display or an HD display like on my Razr. (You could also pause the live tv up to 15 minutes, which is convenient.)Also, since this unit has a built in hotspot and you must connect to it in your wifi settings, you cannot also access the internet at the same time that you are using this app and receiver. What this app needs to do is be able to access this receiver and another wifi hotspot with internet at the same time. It could be something similar to Seagate's Wireless Plus hard drive and app, which lets you do both at the same time (and lets you connect more than one mobile device to it). It seems like an app issue, so maybe in future updates Siano can make this happen in their app. Also, I was disappointed in the fact that only one device can use this receiver at the same time. Maybe that can also be changed in future app updates also.I will be returning this item just because of the NFL games issue.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "QR code on box may be misleading.", "Author": "Elizabeth J.

If you use an iPad you must get the silano app from App Store otherwise it will not work . In Detroit area there are 4 free channels as of this date and different generation iPads May not get them all my iPad 3 only got 3. iPad air got all 4. . Signal is affected by weather, distance, and amount of electronics in room. Some of the stations here do broadcast mobile tv in HD. Sometimes 720p some time 1080p when it happens it look great on retina but it depends on signal and iPad power both have to be great. I was able to get some nfl games, but black out rules are different for Mobil TV and it seems to be up to nfl, and local station if they wish to put games on mobile. Sunday NBC did Fox did not.In conclusion please check coverage area before you purchase, and check if your local stations even broadcast a Mobil signal. For sports check blackout rules for mobile.

Haven't checked to see if more have been added, but I'm very happy with it.Then I took it to work.  The instructions say to put the unit by a window.  At work the nearest window is a small one at least 50 feet away.  That wouldn't have worked, so I set it right outside my office, far from the window (at least 50 feet), and went into the office and tried watching tv on my phone.  It worked, and worked well.I would recommend this to anybody.  Can't wait until more station are added.
