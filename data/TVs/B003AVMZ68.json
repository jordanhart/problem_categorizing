I have a media hard drive, cable TV, and VCR/DVD player connected and it all performs as any great TV would. I have this in my bedroom and its the perfect size for just laying on the bed to watch things. The image quality is okay, it's not AMAZING by any means but its great for a laze-around-watch-TV mood.Overall, works great, looks good, sounds good, and I will continue to use for years to come. It's perfect for where it's placed in my place.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Supports 1080i,720P,480i,480p\nSide PC Input,2 HDMI inputs\n1366x 768 WXGA res\nSleep Timer, auto shut off\n5 band EQ and ECO", "Name": "Sylvania LC220SS1 22-Inch 720p LCD HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415iFfg%2BBmL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003AVMZ68"}}
