{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A quality TV", "Author": "The-Echo", "ReviewID": "RW4JAVHC9OZIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: 5/2/14 : LG APP STORE has launched on this television, bringing free apps such as Pandora, Crackle, Dailymotion, Picasa, there are more but a simple search should show what is available, just trying to give a brief update. Also, the price has decreased on this television set. In addition to the TV software update, there was also an update to the magic remote. The LG TV is still a growing ecosystem. It also appears to allow you to purchase movies/tv episodes through Vudu. Will try to give a better write up when I have more time to experiment with the new menu.Ordered the LG 47LB6300 after my Samsung UN46C6300 went bad, and I will try to use this as my basis for comparison.First off, the item came well packaged, and I paid a bit extra for a Saturday delivery via the Prime membership. It was worth it and came on time.The 47LB6300 shipping weight (33.8lbs) was much lighter than the shipping weight of my old Samsung LED Tv (55lbs) and the delivery man had no problem carrying it up the front steps to my front door. He even helped me get into my front door. The non shipping weight of the LG TV is 28.4 LBS and I believe that includes the stand as well. Where as my Samsung was around 44. The reason I bring this up is because the TV was very easy for me to remove from the box from myself, but if you have help all the better, especially when it comes to putting on the stands.The LG stands are very elegant and simplistic they only require two screws per stand leg and they are a but curvy. They hold up the TV very well and it is sturdy as well. I did order a wall mount but will not be doing that for a while due to a surgery and not being able to lift things.But when it comes time to wall mount it, I see no problems in being able to do it because the TV is so light and thin, and I should have help to mount it anyway making the process even easier after all the drilling and mounting of the bracket. I used the LG bracket finder on their website to find a compatible mount and settled for a Sanus bracket (Sanus VMT5B1 40-50 Inches Premium Series Tilt Wall Mount for Flat-Panel TV (Black).When you first turn on the TV it will take you straight into the Setup process. They use childish penguin animations to aid etc so it should be fun for kids to watch and it gives you a sense of the colors and HD qualities of the TV. I liked it, it was cool. You also have to use the included magic remote that came with the TV to do the setup. I believe there is an option of plugging the coaxial cable for your cable directly into the TV to use the LG Live TV feature, but I do not use this because I prefer to use my cable box hooked up through my Xbox one. So I can't speak about that feature.This is my first personal smart TV but I have used others and I will say this LG has the best UI by far from the ones I have used; being Samsung and Sony. And the Magic Remote makes it easy to navigate through the options.Since I keep on mentioning the Magic Remote. It is basically like a Wii controller. It uses a motion sensor so you're able to click and point on things on the television to select apps / options. Or you can use the arrows / wheel if you prefer. It does have a bit of a learning curve but it's definitely not difficult, just different.The apps on the TV are Netflix, Hulu, Amazon etc the basic streaming services. To my knowledge writing this review on 4/23/14 the LG APP store is not up and running on this television yet.Another reason I bought this TV is that both my mother and I have LG G2 smart phones. The App for this TV that can be found on the Google play store is still in \"BETA\" so there are still some issues with it and it is not ready by any means. They expect to release that functionality sometimes in the second half of 2014. I hope when it is done that it will make the TV easier to use via my phone. I should also say my Xbox One recognizes the LG TV and when I use the voice commands to turn on the system or turn the system off, it will also turn both the tv / cable box off and on.Anyways back to the Apps. You will need to set up WiFi and the TV has a built in WiFi and that should be a quick and easy thing to set up. I have all the individual apps ready to be used on their on should I one day disconnect my Xbox that my family / friends can use those functions. The apps work great, I have had no issues with slow playback when using the TV apps to stream video content.Okay, the picture quality. It is much better than my old Samsung. The LG is ready out of the box and I have found no need to tune the picture quality in mostly dimly lit room, or with sunlight when I have it in my room. The IPS panel really puts out vibrant and bright colors and offers a wider viewing angle. Everything appears to be much smoother than my old Samsung. Everything being basic TV play back, video games, blu-rays, etc. This TV even uses less electricity than my old Samsung.Sound Quality. The sound quality out of box is decent too. It's 20W of power for the speakers. You can be the judge if you need a sound system or not. I am currently happy without one but I have been considering a sound bar that I can pair with my TV, computer, and phone so I can stream music and louder range of sounds and better bass. I am a man that likes utility, but having more sound would be a want not a need for me at the moment.Oh and it also comes with a year free of netflix, I just filed for it today since there seemed to have been an issue claiming that particular LG promotion since they had to update the list of eligible LG TV's since this one is new for this year and that is always a plus. I also believe if you already have Netflix you can use that code on an existing account and get a 90 dollar something credit, which is great if you already have that service.Here is a link to LG's Website about this TV if you want to look it up and find some more information. [...]Thanks for reading and if anyone has any questions I will try my best to answer them. I am enjoying this TV a lot!", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Smart TV done right", "Author": "Camera Noobie.....", "ReviewID": "R147IB1W8NU1MD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "WebOS on the LG TV's is front and center, and not an afterthought.  This is currently the best implementation of \"Smart TV\" technology.  WebOS is quick and responsive.  As of the writing of this review (4/12/14), the LG Store (app store) is not yet launched.  So the only apps you have access to (installed by default) are: Neflix, Hulu Plus, Vudu, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Skype, and a Web Browser.  The web browser is ok, but not great. I have an Amazon account, and I can say that the experience is great with the amazon app.  I am presuming Netflix works well too.  In the amazon app, when you exit and return, it puts you right back into where you left off, nice feature.The picture, sound and typical TV elements are great so I won't review those - needless to say I am very happy with the Audio/Video quality.The TV was easy to mount on the wall using CheetahMount (another great product).In regards to the remote control, this model using a \"Magic Remote\" which is sort of the shape of a Nintendo Wii Nunchuck (without the cable).  It has no keypad on it, but an assortment of buttons and a clickwheel. The pointer on screen is easy to move and not overly sensitive.  I will say, the remote is a bit difficult to get used to at first, but as with anything it gets easier, and it is easier after 1 day of use.  I can't imagine someone not familiar with it, picking it up for he first time and using it correctly (like a babysitter or guest at your house).  Intuitive - the remote is not.  If it was intuitive, anyone (non tech or related) could pick it up and use it proficiently with a small learning curve.  I will say though that it is 'innovative' though.  The lack of the keypad though, makes it more difficult to use.  It does work nicely with my DirectTV Genie system (again, takes a bit to get used too.)  I still keep my DirectTV remote around, because most of the time the TV is just set to the DirectTV input, and it is easier for the rest of the family to just change the channels/DVR with the standard DirectTV remote.Other notes: The free 1 year of Netflix when you buy the TV is not instant; you have to fill out an online form and wait for a response from LG and/or Netflix with the code, and they say it can take up to 3 weeks. That time frame is ridiculous, that could have been automated so you get instant access.  Lastly, I ordered this though Amazon Prime, and it was delivered by Pilot courier.  They were very fast and efficient, they unpacked it, tested the TV (plugged in that's all), and then offered to take the packaging boxes with them.I can't give it 5 stars.  If the Magic Remote was completly intuituve, they would have gotten 5 stars.  If I could give 4 1/2 I would have.I'm looking forward to seeing what other apps are released (facebook, pandora, etc).", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent choice for the 2014 model year.", "Author": "Get Back Jojo \"manard\"", "ReviewID": "R393IOXYJS5DTF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to say I really like this TV and am glad I picked it. The smart remote is interesting and really seems like a logical progression from the old large remotes. For anyone not in the know it puts a pointer on the screen that you can move like with the Wii. I upgraded from a 7 year old Sony I purchased back when 720P was the affordable option. The picture quality difference is immediately obvious even on just digital cable channels which I really wasn't expecting. As others have stated setup is quick, easy and cute with it's childish cartoon graphics. I had no problem finding my 5ghz wireless N network. Once connected via the setup wizard (about 20 minutes with channel searches) each app I tried immediately prompted me for updates. the updates took a minute a piece including download, installation and then firing up. mine included the LG Store and browser right out of the box or it updated immediately without my noticing. Netflix. Amazon, Vudu and Hulu worked flawlessly upon first use. The Amazon interface is fare better than the Xbox 360's.The one thing that drove me nuts was where to find the settings so you can change the sound and picture and that's because it's a small icon on the top left of the home screen while you're looking at the bottom with all the app options. It also has what I would consider a weird channel layout. It keeps all the cable, digital cable, antenna and digital antenna channels separated so you can't just flip through them in order. It seems absolutely counter intuitive to me.One final thought... remember that stupid 3D craze that you absolutely knew just wasn't going to last long well I guess it's over because none of the major brands have affordable 3D T.V.s this model year. I really don't want to care except that all the other components I purchased are 3D ready and now that I've stepped up my game and there are a litany of 3D movies available for home viewing I kind of would have liked to have made a family 3D movie night out of it but oh well. They really should have removed the darned 3D button from the remote. I could have purchased last years model if that was a big deal to me but the $80 price drop and updated hardware and the slightly better power consumption seem like a good trade off tbh.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for the money, hoping for software improvements", "Author": "Soundguy26", "ReviewID": "R1Z208UKVXJD5I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was really surprised to find that I could get all the features I wanted in a TV this size for under 1K. Originally I thought I didn't want to pay for Smart TV features, but I realized that the hassle of having to turn on the PS3 and make sure the controller is always charged ended up being a deterrent from using Hulu and Netflix. Basically, unless it requires next to zero effort to use, I'm not going to bother with it when I'm in such a vegged-out state in front of the TV. I can't even be bothered to get up to get my neck pillow most of the time!WebOS / Smart TVThe new WebOS platform really got my attention due to its reported responsiveness and ease of use. While my use of Hulu and Netflix has gone way up, due to the ease of switching to and from TV, there are quite a few little quirks about the WebOS platform that I hope are resolved soon:- If my set-top cable box is not already on when the TV is on, it will display \"No input\", even after the set-top box is turned on! The only way to fix this is to turn the TV off, then on again! What a joke!- The \"Home\" button does not respond for 10 seconds or so after the TV is turned on. You don't get any feedback once the TV is ready to accept this input, either. It would be nice if the Home menu popped up once it was finally ready if you pressed it soon after the TV was turned on. Don't just ignore those inputs!- The picture options menu layout is completely ridiculous. At the base layer you have some basic options, then you have two sub menus called \"Picture Options\" (I thought I was already there??), and \"Expert Options\". There are some other layout quirks here that make adjusting picture options practically like navigating a maze in the dark; you just kind of have to feel your way around, but you'll get there eventually. It's disappointing to see such disorganization in a new platform, since that's when you'd expect to find everything tidied up!PictureI wasn't expecting the best for this price, nor did I unexpectedly find it. The blacks are not all that deep, and even after using another expert's calibration settings, I'm not completely satisfied. At least the back lighting is not as uneven as I have seen in 55\" and larger models, though I can definitely see dimmer areas around the edges. Overall, I think I got what I paid for, and perhaps slightly more.SoundI am an acoustics professional, and I do not have any major gripes about the quality in this department. I haven't tried to watch a Michael Bay movie (nor would I likely ever), but that could change my opinion, due to the lack of a built-in subwoofer. I would also like to see a \"night time\" listening option to keep everything more even when others are trying to sleep. Future update maybe?AppsI know people want the LG store to open, but I think its likely that there simply aren't any other apps available, given how new the platform is, so opening the store would not do any good. As for the performance of Hulu and Netflix, I haven't noticed much if any hazy/SD video, even at the start of episodes, so I'm pretty happy with that. Then again, I have Cox Cable, which recent news articles suggest hasn't been putting the throttling squeeze on Netflix like Comcast has (at least not yet).

The IPS panel makes for great off center viewing.  Color and picture definition are great and black levels are decent.Harmony recently added the 42LB6300 to their device database.  It means I can control basic functions like on/off and input selection using my Harmony remote.  So far I have to use the Magic Remote for the Smart TV functions, which is something I can live with.  I use an Apple TV and the apps on the TV were a secondary concern to me.After reading some other comments, most surprising to me was the response to my NetFlix offer redemption.  I got my activation code within 24 hours, applied it to my existing NetFlix account and got a $95.88 credit.  It seems like LG had a problem with this initially but may have gotten it resolved.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV!", "Author": "Pixie 401", "ReviewID": "R1XTF99ZME9F3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first got this TV, I wasn't too impressed with the picture, it wasn't as clear as I had hoped for.  I had a Samsung LCD 720p TV whose picture was actually better than the LG's.  I figured maybe it was the cable box settings, adjusted those, but got minor improvement.  Then it occurred to me that it could be the cable box.  The cable people came out and determined that changing the box wouldn't make a difference.  Mind you, the guy thought there was nothing wrong with the picture.It later occurred to me that the HDMI cable could be the problem, I was using the ones I had bought years ago.  So I bought the latest Amazon Basics cable - and now, the picture is STUNNING!!!!! Crisp, crystal clear - so long as you're watching high def, of course.  You can see the pores on Anderson Cooper's nose! And those home shopping channel hosts  and models - oh boy! Skin is not perfect - TV is so clear, you can see how they have tried to hide flaws with makeup.  Watched Madagascar the other night, and you can see every detail.  Best one so far is Life of Pi - the detail you see on the Tiger's coat is amazing!  The only negative I have remarked about the TV is that the picture pixelates when there is fast action in a scene that has a lot of color. Mind you, I have only noticed this with the Mucinex ad with the cartoon character mowing the lawn and flowers go all over the place (know the one?).  And even then it's just for a few seconds - not enough reason to quibble.TV sound is good enough.  I have yet to hook up my Bose Solo, and the sound is adequate.TV was very easy to set up - had it connected to my WIFI in minutes.  I chose the standard picture setting, turned down the color and have not had to adjust it since.  Unlike the 2014 Vizio E048i I bought and returned - I was constantly adjusting the picture. None of the preset ones were ideal, so I was adjusting the color, contrast etc., a real headache so I returned it.With this LG, I bought the 47 inch.  I'm surprised at how slim the TV is - I would say it's about as slim as the Samsung UN48H6350 which I had considered buying until I saw the LG which was about $150 cheaper at the time. (As of writing this, the Samsung has reduced in price).  The legs on the LG is different to what is pictured - they are curved and provide a solid stand for the TV.  No wobbling that you get with the stands that are in the center of the TV.As to the apps, I have only used YouTube, Netflix (you get one year free) and Amazon Prime so far and had no problems viewing videos.  I haven't tried the web browser yet but don't envisage any problems. Hooked up Apple TV with no problems. This TV also starts up quickly - turn it on and in two or three seconds you're viewing the channel.  The Samsung I have takes at least 30 seconds or more to start up.I have had no problems using the Magic Remote.  If you can use a cordless mouse, you can use this remote easily - you point it at the TV (not use it on a hard surface).  I also like the size of the remote - about the length of your hand and is easy to hold.All in all, now I have the right cable, I am more than happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Alex R.", "ReviewID": "R3NRRTV6VL64AP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Satisfied with TV, setup is intuitive, picture and sound are great, did not need to change any presets, webOS is fast.

I was hoping the IPS display found on this model would really make the images 'pop' because I have an IPS computer monitor and the images on that screen absolutely rocks.  But I was left disappointed with the overall picture quality.  After spending hours over the weekend trying to get the optimal settings (even using the suggested settings found online), I found this TV set to be lacking in the 'deep blacks' department.  Images that are supposed to be black appear slightly grayish.  I'm comparing this to other TVs around the house (Samsung and Sharp), which both produced deeper blacks (both TVs are few years older too).  Good contrast on a TV makes the images pop more on the screen, something this LG TV lacks.  The only picture setting I really could use was the 'Vivid' setting, tweaked to tone down the color and sharpness.  The Vivid setting also produced the deepest blacks.Don't get me wrong, it's a good TV.  The images are clear with good color that would satisfy most.  I also like LGs TruMotion motion effect compared to both the Samsung and Sharp TVs.  It just seems smoother and doesn't look as soap opera-ish (if that makes sense).  It has excellent viewing angles.  It would have been an incredible TV had it been able to produce deeper blacks.Other things I liked about the TV was the surprisingly good speakers.  And the WebOS works pretty well and is intuitive.The magic remote takes a little time to get used to.  I prefer pushing 1 button to change a setting.  With this remote, I have to push several buttons just to switch the TV input.I'm still on the fence about keeping this TV.  I still have 3 weeks to decide.  I do think it's good value for what I paid for ($499 at Fry's with 1 year Netflix).", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Karella", "ReviewID": "R3749J1S11QFW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Totally in love with this TV.

Our price range for a replacement was up to $1100 and we wanted a 55-60\" screen size. We weren't even certain we wanted another LG (due to the issue with the old set), but after looking in person at the multitude available, we narrowed it down to just 3 (including the Sharp LC-60LE650U and the Samsung UN55H6350).We chose the 55LB6300 for a few reasons. The pictures on the comparables were all very similar, but we liked the Smart interface of the LG over the others and preferred the more modern dark silver beveled edge. We did wall mount, but the legs of this model were slick too. This one also offered a 1 year subscription to Netflix. Overall, it was a close comparison.Our 1 week initial impressions:This is an outstanding TV for the price. The images are exceptionally clear, the brightness is excellent, and setup was relatively simple. There is a slight glare on the tv, but very similar to others we considered and better than plasma. Blacks are sufficiently dark, the Vivid color mode was a good option (though we ultimately created a custom setting).  We were able to setup the wifi to our router with ease, and in a few minutes, we had Netflix, HuluPlus, and Amazon Prime running. We were pleasantly surprised with how quickly we were up and running and also how quickly we caught on to the magic remote (just a slight learning curve - but we've never used a Wii).An update came through for the mouse and the firmware after we setup, and with this release also came the LG Store. We downloaded Crackle and another app - more apps are promised soon, so we'll check back monthly to see what's available.  It is leaps and bounds better than the previous LG we owned and really offers a truly integrated Smart functionality.

The LG Sync works perfectly with my LG Blue Ray Player, instant connection and the player response to the controller. The Magic Remote takes a little time to get use to, but is easy to use after that time. One small problem, I was using a LG ST600 Smart TV up grader on my last TV and when streaming a movie from on line I could Pause the movie, the Magic Remote won't, can't access the control panel part by pressing the Input Button.Picture Quality is fantastic, turned off the Auto Backlight and really enjoy the sharpness of the screen. Can view from any position in the room and get a perfect view of the screen. Haven't had to make any adjustments. Only thing is that the Picture Setting occasionally resets to Sports and I have to go in and change to my preference. For the price of this set, you cannot beat the quality of the picture.Sound quality is very good from the set itself, for movies I route it through the Optical jack to an external system, but for normal TV viewing I use the internal speakers and am happy with the volume and tone.Overall I would give this set 4 and a half stars, really enjoy the set and the quality of the picture.

By the way those who purchase this TV with regards to the LG store a updates will begin shortly after receiving your product.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very poor black levels, Motion blur in gaming mode", "Author": "Gilly", "ReviewID": "R20FVOH9Q3R89T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A good TV from a solid manufacturer. It just fell a bit short in too many categories for me and I wanted to post a detailed review of my initial impressions. The ultimate let down for me was the lack of deep black color.I picked up a 42\" and 47\" version of this TV. I returned the 42\". 47\" was $499 at Frys anniversary sale but even at that steep discount this might not be the right TV for me. I ultimately returned the 47\" unopened.I wanted to like these units, I researched all I could before buying but I wish I saw it in person first before ordering online.  Prices are dropping quick, hold out for big discounts that are inevitably coming. Prices have gone down $149 in just weeks.Pros:[+]Thin bezel, Aesthetics. Love the dark silver color, not distracting (Minus the fake chrome on the feet)[+]Good viewing angles with IPS panel. Color shift at off center viewing is also good. If its for a living room with a large couch everyone gets to see a reasonable picture.[+]Low power consumption in its class. There is no question this LG series is very power efficient.[+]Good color gamut (Minus the awful blacks)[+]Wireless and Wired network connections both worked well. I specifically tried wireless for quality and it played Netflix higher quality content smoothly.  Wired connection obviously yielded smoother connectivity and playback experience one would expect. Netflix is on the latest interface that you are already used to.[+]Low input lag (23ms) in game preset video mode only[+]Decent sound. Not great, just slightly better than average on mid tier HDTVs. If you are not an audiophile you will be able to live with it in a bedroom or small area.[+]Current hdmi playback continues in the background when you open the home screen[+]Stable with the feet attached. Doesn't rock around too much like a center stand.[+]No dead, stuck, or damaged pixels. Screen was pixel perfect. A+ grade[+]Voice recognition on the remote works well. You can say \"Netflix\" into it and it opens all the way into the ap.Cons:[-]Terrible black levels - more of a dark grey. I have a 2014 Samsung 5500 series and the black quality is amazing. Puts the LG to shame. Its so bad that black is not even the color black. Its charcoal grey with IPS panel glow behind it. Deal breaker and a reason to not buy. Once you have seen real black levels, everything short of that is a disappointment. The blacks in my opinion ruin the picture of the unit. You can adjust between two options on blacks, neither are great.[-]Despite the full array back lighting statistic, its still uneven and splotchy. There are translucent 1/2\" grey stripes all the way around the outside of the screen that overlap in the corners giving a checkerboard square in each corner. If you are on a white, grey, or black background you can see uneven light distribution.[-]No Dolby/DTS sound on the optical out - PCM stereo output only (what a joke). High input lag creates voice sync issues with external amplifiers. You must have lipsync features on your receiver or you will have the sound ahead of the lip movement on screen. TV has no options to remedy this. I did not test this but some sites report that the internal cable tuner will output Dolby through the optical output, although digital cable is less and less usable on internal tuners without cable card slots.[-]Image persistence issues with the IPS panel. Just like first generation LCD screens, just a very brief amount of time with something on the screen will leave a persistent image. Just another thing I thought would not be an issue in a 2014 model. Just a minute or two of something on screen, change to just a flat color background like grey and you can see everything faint in persistence. If you open windows on your computer on a dark background, odd lines extend from the edges of the window all the way to the edge of the screen no matter how big the window is or positioned. Very odd, and very distracting. if you take the # symbol as an example, with the center being the open window. The lines extend outward.[-]Cheap hard plastic remote with large braille bumps. Hard plastic unintuitive button layout. Two AA batteries in one end. Unbalanced. Primary controls at the top of remote, weighted towards the bottom. Impossible to find and push the button you want with 100% accuracy. Its all flat buttons without any real feedback as to what you are pushing. Lack of buttons and some of the few you get are wasted and cannot be reprogrammed to other functions. Shiny slick piano black finish. The mouse wheel in the center feels cheap and its not accurate to roll. The main select button on the remote is pushing the mouse wheel down. That is never going to last. That primary frequently used button needs to be a dedicated button and raised rubber.[-]The DLNA interface is poorly done and not useful. I would never use that interface on a daily basis. Its laggy just like all the other smart tvs, and I have tried quite a few. LG adds in extra material into your DLNA results that are not on your home network. They think they are doing you a favor mixing in random web videos into your own home audio and video collection. No matter what you request for it to show overall, its adds in extra stuff.  This is without a registered or logged in LG account. I opted out and did not connect.[-]The redesigned fake chrome feet are not as shown in photos you see where this TV is sold. They do not have the V shaped feet.  The feet are C shaped and flat on the table. Fake plastic chrome look to some part of the feet. Its pretty stable so I do like the way they work. More stable than a center stand. Not likely to tip over from an animal.[-]The lack of aps on webos. There is just nothing there useful or exciting. NOTHING. It reminds me of the early Roku days when it was all religious and foreign aps, with a few ap creators just desperate for any exposure they can get. There are no real up to date aps that people flock to. Crackle is really the only useful add-on application. No plex, No time warner.  This feels like the betamax of smart tv back ends.  Samsung and Visio seem to have continuity and a large selection. LG is not ap maker friendly and they have poor selections and many complain they dont carry over the aps from prior years.  So instead of having a nice large ap catalog of quality choices like Samsung. Its a few dozen if that of very poor choices.[-]The onscreen controls for my tivo are bugged and every button press registers the last button pressed. Maybe they will fix that with firmware. The \"magic\" remote is sending some kind of haywire instruction to my Tivo HD DVR that makes it want to repeat the last button pressed on any remote after the magic remote is used. They decided in their infinite wisdom to put channel change on rolling the mouse wheel up and down, so if you barely rub the wheel, bam the channel changes. Try to get it back? Ooops, channel goes the wrong way again...[-]bad ghosting and blur in PC games, unbearable. Fast motion gaming is just pure blur. You simply cannot see what you want to unless you stop moving. How in 2014 is this considered acceptable performance? If you play an FPS game like BF4 you can play if you deploy a bipod and sit in one spot. If you try to pilot a helicopter on the other hand you cant make out any details or units on the ground, its more like discerning islands vs water and that's about it, pure blur.[-]Extreme judder, while gaming there is not only ghosting and motion blur but never ending persistent judder. Its unreal[-]No IR receiver on the TV to use my TiVo remote for power on/off. Its a proprietary RF remote.[-]No 3.5mm headphone jack", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "47\" LG47ML6200  smart 3D  No sound/ black screen.
