{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hands down, the best TV at this price point!", "Author": "M. Barnes", "ReviewID": "R3RCH9HT5ENI82", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start off by giving you some background. I have owned 3 Sony HDTV's since 2006. The first was a rear projection LCD model that I purchased for about $3800 in mid-2006 and had a design defect with something called the \"optic block\" that ended up as the subject of a class action lawsuit. Sony extended the warranty for a year because of it. Some people got new flat panel TV's for free or extreme discounts. Mine was repaired once and by the time it broke again, which was inevitable, It was out of warranty and Sony wouldn't help me.  I have bought Sony all my life and thought that sometime you just get a lemon, so I gave them another chance and in mid-2009 bought a KDL-52V5100 for about $2000. I had nothing but problems right out of the box.  The TV's auto dimming feature would make the screen so dim that it went very dark in movies and video games and you couldn't see anything in dark scenes, EVEN WITH SMART DIMMING TURNED OFF! Sony sent me a firmware update, which didn't fix it. Then they sent me a new TV, same problem. It was obviously a software/hardware design issue. They sent me a KDL-52W5100 as a replacement, which was a slight upgrade. I was fairly happy with that TV other than the 8-bit panel which did cause noticeable banding at times. Then, in May of 2012, roughly 3 years old it started exhibiting a picture problem where the whole left side of the screen would turn green and horizontal lines covering the rest of the screen appeared along with a terrible high pitched squealing noise. Sony, of course, refused to help me as this TV only had a 1 year warranty. I found out from a local shop that it needed a new LCD panel for about $1600, which of course meant that my 3 year old TV was now a big door stop. The Sony name used to mean quality, but after spending almost $6000 in roughly 4 years and then having no working TV is ridiculous. I decided I was done with Sony. It's really too bad. I've been buying Sony my whole life.Before this I didn't really consider Vizio because it's always been a pretty low end brand. I did some research and found the M3D550KD, which had the same features as the $2400 Sony KDL-55HX850 (except for Gorilla Glass). In fact it scored better than the Sony by far in native contrast ratio and black level. A review from PC Magazine gave it 4 out of 5 stars and the editor's choice award. See review on pcmag.com.**After connecting to my WI-FI and turning the TV off for about 10 minutes, when I turned back on it had updated itself to the latest firmware.First thing I did was calibrate the TV using Digital Video Essentials HD - DVE HD Basics Blu-ray. The settings I came up with are below.User Menu Settings:* Picture Modeso Picture Mode : Customo Color Temperature : Normalo Aspect Ratio : Normal/Wide* Picture Settingso Backlight : 55o Contrast : 50o Brightness : 42o Color : 55o Tint : -1o Sharpness : 8* Advanced Videoo Smooth Effect : Offo Real Cinema Mode : Smootho Noise Reduction : Offo Color Enhancement : Offo Adaptive Lumina : Offo Film Mode : Autoo Smart Dimming : Offo Ambient Sensor : Off**XBOX360 Users Note: One thing that kind of freaked me out when I first hooked up my XBOX was that if you set resolution to 1080p most of the advanced picture settings disappear from the menu. Not just greyed out/unavailable, the menu actually changes. If you set the TV to the input your XBOX is connected to, bring up the TV settings menu, then power on the XBOX you can actually watch the picture settings menu change! The picture mode (Custom, Standard, Movie, Etc.) in gone, the advanced picture menu is gone and the only options available are Contrast, Brightness, Backlight, Game mode and Ambient Light Sensor.  I called Vizio and after finally getting hold of a engineer rather than tech support he verified that it was by design. Apparently the XBOX can communicate with the TV and takes over all these settings. It knows what the TV can and can't do and takes full advantage of the TV's capabilities. If I set the resolution to 1080i it didn't do this. I was a little worried about this at first, but after setting to 1080i and using my tweaked settings I could not make it look nearly as good as the XBOX controlled settings when set to 1080p. The picture was amazing! The PS3 does not exhibit the same behavior when set to 1080p although still looks amazing with my custom settings.PROS:* Verifiable 10-bit panel, so no banding (most companies are not disclosing anymore).* Very complete set of advanced customizable picture settings.* Audio was surprisingly better than I expected and better than other LED backlit super thin TV's I've looked at.* Excellent color and black level.* Bluetooth Remote with built-in QWERTY keyboard.* 3D is excellent, it really pops and the TV comes with 4 pairs of glasses (So far, testing with 3D Blu-ray and XBOX 3D games the TV auto detects if you turn 3D on and I haven't had to set the mode manually in the TV menu).* LG panel (So basically it's generic LG)* Inexpensive 3D glasses because of passive 3D. ($4 for a pack of 2 on Amazon)* Lots of built-in web apps. (haven't had any crashing as others have reported)* Better than expected Standard Definition picture quality.* Customizable EQ audio settings are a plus. (Not quite as customizable as my old Sony but still very good)CONS:* Screen is more on the glossy side than the matte side so it's semi reflective which makes room placement more important (more so than my old Sony) but not full glossy like most of the Samsung's I looked at.* No 2D to 3D conversion.* Noticeable blooming on really dark scenes (common in all edge-lit LED/LCD's).* Noticeable \"electronic\" smell for about the first 3 or 4 days. It's gone now (common in new electronics also).* As with all Vizio's I've seen, the menu and Apps are a bit slow and clunky (especially compared to the Sony, but it's literally half the price of the equivalent Sony!)* No manual firmware updates check that I can see and none to download on Vizio's website (although it automatically updated itself almost immediately after I connected it to my WI-FI)* No DLNA or web browser, which most brands include in a TV of this caliber (possible firmware update in the future?)* Uses more power than most LED/LCD TV's this size (108 Watts).Bottom Line:The best \"bang for your buck\" TV out there! At this price, you will not be disappointed! This is my first Vizio and I love it. 3D is great, lots of features, and great built-in internet apps.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture", "Author": "Dave the rave", "ReviewID": "R1J5SABQYO49NE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to order this from amazon, but they were out of stock, so got it on Costco.com.  I was hesitant to get a vizio, but I already spent good money on 60\" Panasonic plasma for our finished basement, so this TV was for the family room.  So I figured I would risk the better quality for features, size and price.  Now that I have it, I dont feel I risked too much!  The picture on this vizio is awesome.  It took some time to fiddle with the settings (no suggested calibration on any websites as its a new model).  I am shocked at the picture quality, especially after reading all the videophile reviews about plasma vs. led.  My Panasonic St30 is awesome, but this picture is nearly the same.  To be picky, the contrast/blacks might be slightly better on the panny, but it's hard to tell.  Not only that, my family room where this tv is located has two large windows FACING the tv!  I thought the screen was a pure matte, but I would call it a dull semi gloss.  A first I was upset and thought it would ruin the daytime viewing experience.  My family laughed at me saying, \"what are you talking about?\".  They see no glare.  I see some when shows go to commercial or screen is black.Once you find your settings to your liking, the picture, color is exceptional.  I don't quite understand all the talk about judder/motion blur/etc.  only thing I've seen is the occasional ghosting of a baseball on some throws from outfielder to home plate.  But nothing during other parts of game.  Watched some football replays on nfl network...no issues..Have only used 3d to test it with avatar bluray.  Insane picture and really pops.  The remote with slide out keyboard is a bonus.  Easily synced it with cable box and bluray player.  My family loves only using one remote.  Sound is so much better than you hear about with new TV's.  I still have it hooked up to receiver and klipsch surround speakers, but rarely used by family so far.  SRS surround is actually pretty good at some surround effect sound.The apps are good, but a bit sluggish.  Won't use much other than amazon video.  Watched African cats on amazon and picture was crazy good.  Some pixelation, but mainly due to my crappy Comcast Internet.All in all, I highly recommend.  And I wont say a good value for budget HDTV.  It's a great deal regardless.  Picture will rival much more expensive TV's.  Now only time will tell in regards to longevity.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for me", "Author": "I bought it", "ReviewID": "R3FBXBV83OOFMX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this TV for a month and I love it!  Setup was very easy.  The built in WIFI works great!  The picture is bright and clear.  I left everything set the way it was out of the box and we are very happy.  Our room has three windows facing the screen and even on the brightest days, I don't have any problems with glare or the picture not being being enough.  We even have light about two feet away from where it's mounted on the wall.  No problem with that either.  The sound for a flat pannel TV is pretty good.  In fact I haven't even seriously considered upgrading sound yet.  It's adequate for regular veiwing.  The 3D is very cool.  I bought Underworld Awakenings with my new 3D Blu Ray player.  Again the picture was outstanding and the 3D works very well.  The only problem I have is the keyboard on the remote doesn't always register the keys I push.  One out of ten letters will be lost.  This is not a problem for me and if I had to have a problem, this is what I would have picked.  You simply can't beat the value with this TV.  It has every current feature there is and in my opinion, works very well.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for such a low price", "Author": "K. Halloran \"bridgenet\"", "ReviewID": "RWS8QX6TO0DCR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Have had this TV for a few days now and although there are issues you can't beat the price.  I've got two Samsung UN55C8000 55\" I got two years ago for about $1600 more and yes they are a better TV but I can buy two Vizio's that are of acceptable quality.  Got this TV for the kids game room.  Some of the Pros:- Decent picture.- Lots of Widget apps for network access.  Much better than Samsung.- Plenty of interface jacks.  Much more than you need given most people would connect stuff to a home theater system if you have that much stuff to connect.- WiFi works like a charm.  Already streamed a movie from Amazon Prime and Vudu.Cons:- Audio isn't the best, you have to play with it to get rid of the tinny sound but then OK.  Will probably get a sound bar at some point.- Very glossy screen.- In a dark room you can see brightness at the corners, black isn't as black.  Not that big a deal.- SD looks poor but does on most HDTV's.  This one is worse than my Samsungs.The biggest problem I had with this TV (which cost is a star) is when I powered it up the logo would flash an error code and then there was a black screen.  Figured, great, it is a dud.  Code was 2, 5, 11 flashes for anyone else that see's it.  Once the setup screen appeared but remote would not work (could only turn/on off scroll arrows would not work).  I never call tech support as they tend to be useless so tried a bunch of stuff.  Turned the TV on with the manual buttons and the setup screen appeared, then used the manual buttons to scroll work through the menus and there is one to sync the remote.  Once that was done all worked great and have never had the dreaded flashing logo again.  This really isn't acceptable given there is nothing in their guide about it and nothing on a Google search either (that was recoverable).  I guess ask again in 6 months and see if it occurs again.As a side note I used a $16.50 video mount (VideoSecu Ultra Slim), works great (had similar mount for my Samsungs but paid $100 for them).  Spacing on the back of the TV is about 16\" on center which makes using them a bit hard to hang but with two people and some slack in the wire you can get it to work.Even with the flashing logo error you can't beat the price and right now it is working great.

This is the first part of my review, since I did a lot of research to buy this TV. Originally, I was going to buy the 3D, 1080p, LG or Samsung TV. Then I researched and researched and researched and saw this TV. Originally came out in late 2011, this TV is comparable to the quality of LG and Samsung on a budget. Before I go too far, little bit of back history. I'm tech savy and had a Samsung 55\" LCD before, my sister has the 60\" Sharp Aquos, and I'm a designer, and my eyes are pretty sharp when it comes to quality of pictures, since that's how I make a living (I'm use to 27\" LED monitors with 2560 x 1440 dp).The thing that I hate about the modern 120 or 240 hz TV is that you can't watch old movies and still have that feeling of nostalgia, since everything looks like it's too real to life.Anyway, here it is:Pros:1. 3d is amazing.2. comes with 4 pair of good non-shuttering 3d glasses and they fit big heads3. Branding logo could be 'on' or 'off', which is great. A lot of the companies don't offer this option for an obvious reason, but by offering this option, I think the company respect us4. Excellent 2d pictures5. Excellent internet web apps, specifically Youtube and Amazon instant watch. I haven't tried Netflix, because, I don't subscribe to them anymore since a while ago, and Amazon Prime instant watch double as free two day shipping on stuff you buy on Amazon and it's only $75 or so6. Remote is very well designed with its piano black surface and nice feel buttons, that you don't have to press so hard to make it work. Sliding keyboard is pretty slick7. Setup was easy8. Going through the options are easy9. Equalizer for this price?? 3D? 1080? 240hz? I thought it was a scam until I got it today10. I really appreciate the semi-anti reflective surface of the tv. It's really nice.11. I thought this thing was going to be massively thick, since there are no picture of it sideways, but this is a slim design model.12. The base is heavy and sturdy and the polished metal connector tend to add a little something something.13. This TV has lots of connecting options that you usually find in something that costs about $500 or more.14. The delivery was excellent. They were on time, and the people who delivered actually took real good care of the tv while they were assembling. 15 minutes and bam, it was running and they were out the door. They didn't even stick around for a tip. They even offer to take the box to the trash (I live in the 4th floor).15. I hate these high definition TV's since the movie you watched as a child looks like a reality TV show... But I found out if you turn off the \"smooth motion effect\", your old movies will look just like how you saw it when you were a kid, but in a lot better resolution than before.Cons:1. No 2d to 3d conversion, which is not a big deal. At this price level, I think the 3d quality is excellent. At $500 more, the 2d to 3d conversion tend to suck2. The 3d Glasses don't look anything like what's on marketing (specifically the big chrome V on the side of the legs). But they're really comfortable and they will go over your glasses.3.It takes exactly 10 seconds to turn on, then it takes about another 10 seconds to open your internet apps. But really? Every time I have one of these first world problems, I remember Louis CK. \"You're sitting in a chair in Sky!\"4. I think when the black space is empty, without any fillers, like in film, and it's just black for the purpose of being black, not dark, you could see some blooming on the sides, specifically 4 on each side, exactly.5. The internet web app's UI/UX could be better, but I'm not complaining. There is a 55\" TV that is connected to my TV and it brings me free videos from the internet!6. Remote is filled with my finger prints. You only notice it when you see it up close, and honestly, it doesn't bother me. But it is only infrared, and I wish they were wifi based like Samsung or LG or Sony, so I could get an android app on my phone for it. Youtube remote is available for Androids.7.I had my external hard drive connected with full of movies via USB onto the TV, but it didn't register when I was setting up, so I think you have to connect your computer to access your external hard drive library.8. I wish they used more of the color coded buttons as options. I'm still confused about \"back\" vs \"exit\", since back doesn't work sometimes, and exit sometimes exit you out of the apps.9. Equalizer takes some time to configure. Good thing is that they work without confirming or selecting first.10. The screen still reflects a little bit, but I don't notice it that much. But you can see your blurry lamp in the background. I try to put a custom made lamp behind the TV, about 5 inches away from the TV's back plate, but that created a wavy motion on the screen after 15 minutes, so I had to move the lamp. I'm sure the LED lights work a lot better, although my lamp was at 45watt, and was surrounded by an aluminum body.11. The fit and quality of the frame is questionable. They try to save money by putting two panels together on top of the screen instead of having a long and single panel of plastic. Plus the shiny frame is too reflective and distracting. I wish it was matte finished.12. The base is shiny too, so it collects every tiny hair from my dog and cats. But it's not a big deal.13. The apps do crash, so your Youtube will crash, then you have to turn the TV off and on and again.14. For some reason, the apps tend to load for a long time, each time you start the TV.15. No upgrade, or update firmware options. I hope it's automatically done...16. First world problem : A lot of features that I have to learn...17. I heard this TV lasts about 8 months and dies. Well, at this price, that's not such a bad thing. You could do worst.Overall:Really good 3D quality, 2D is very good, a lot of options, and internet apps work great. If you don't think too much about the little things, you'd probably enjoy this tv.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3d TV", "Author": "Fabloski", "ReviewID": "R5U1T6JRG282W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a brand-new 3-D TV owner I've had a 3-D TV model before so I can use that my experience is what you get this TV with it's passive 3-D technology is far superior to the active 3-D technology used by most TVs. The difference between active 3-D and passive 3-D is that the active 3-D uses shutter glasses that cost $75-$150 and passive 3-D uses the glasses you find in the movie theater which run between $5-$20 dollars. Active 3-D technology supposed to produce a superior 3-D picture from my experience at least with this TV and the Samsung TV I find that the passive 3-D actually produces a better 3-D technology picture. This TV also doesn't suffer from what other 3-D TVs suffer from which is a very dim picture when you go to the 3-D mode, it's actually very bright and almost movie theater like quality. I have no complaints about this TV the 55 inch size and the reasonable price make this a Best Buy for most consumers.", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Multi-purpose media screen", "Author": "Paul \"Media Nerd\"", "ReviewID": "R2JFYOMTGZ2JZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first I thought the screen would be too big for my New York apartment.  But then I plugged in my seven year old Sony laptop into the RGB input and used wireless keyboard and mouse to view my computer screen from my easy chair about nine feet away.  While movies and TV shows are the obvious use of a big 55\" screen, it was super to surf the web on this screen and watch any stream video on the internet this wonderful way.  I recommend anyone who is thinking of getting rid of their old and working laptop, to plug it into your large flat screen (get cheap wireless mouse and keyboard) to enjoy the internet with the whole family on the large screen.  There are ways to access the internet within the Vizio software.....HOWEVER ....  I want to reach the WHOLE internet through my laptop/browser and I want to use a regular keyboard rather than a thumb-keyboard connected to the remote.I also bought the SKYPE camera so I have had my family video conference using the Vizio.  That was fun.Also, if you have and AMAZON PRIME account, you will love watching your FREE movies on the Vizio.  I used to watch on my Kindle Fire.  but the quality on a full 55\" screen is great.  Of course, a fast internet connection is always a requirement.It is also wonderful to play your HDTV videos and HI-RES stills from your vacation on the big screen.  I have a phone/camera that does huge panorama pictures and that's a treat to blow up on the large screen and then pan across the panorama.Since the Vizio HDTV comes with internet plug-ins it is possible to get a SKYPE, Facebook or Twitter message notification suddenly appear in a corner of the TV show you are watching.  You can then move your TV show image over a little while you look at who was messaging you in the left quarter of the screen.That's why I call this set a real multi-media center in your house.

If you are looking for a new TV set for size, 3D, or value make no mistake this is the one for you. The best thing is you do not have to sacrifice quality as well. This review will go over just the video aspects of the TV set as if you are getting this you can get a sound system with the money you saved.Pros: Let's talk about the good thing this set has to offer.* Smart Diming = Deep blacks. Many of you may know this is an Edge lit LED set now most edge lit set do not offer this great to have feature. What this does is allows the LED's on a region to turn off and not shine light to offer you more true blacks.* Color Balance = Life like Picture. After calibration this set will offer you SUPERB colors among the best out of competing sets released this year.* 3D Passive = ReadD at home. Last year Vizio was the first to market in the USA with a Passive 3D TV set. This is the same technology used in your local 3D theaters (non IMAX 3D) that that give you is an already used and cheaper 3D format. If you would like to obtain more glasses just go a local show and keep the set the theater gives you. Also some may argue you get half the resolution due to the image being filtered out by half for each eye in order to see 3D but science has shown us this is incorrect. If you want to know more about Active VS Passive here is a there is a non-bias test that has been run by the site DisplayMate [...].* Uniformity = Same quality throughout. You will not notice that this is an Edge lit display it will give you the same great image even in the middle of the screen which is often an issue with other edge lit LED TV's.* Smart TV = Bye Bye cable TV. This set comes with an app center that has over 150 apps available and they include all the top dogs one of the few to have all these noted NetFlix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu and YouTube.* Value = Money in your pocket for Blu-Rays. This set will save you a lot of money for an amazing TV. With that money I would recommend you get these Blu-Ray Disk as they will show you why you purchased this set. #1 Prometheus 3D this has set the bar of what a 3D movie set should include with great audio and video packed with extras galore #2 Avatar 3D not no.1 due to Prometheus recent outstanding release but it is great none the less, no extras just the movie with this set #3 The Dark Knight this movie is another reason why you own an HDTV with its constant use of IMAX footage to make you say WOW #4 Alien Anthology this is Fox's definitive release of the Alien saga time to test your blacks #5 Life make sure you are smart and get the version narrated by David Attenborough, this will make you take a second look outside and say wow real life doesn't look as good as my TV.Cons: As always with the good comes the bad.* Blooming = Light leak. This is a small issue only when the screen is completely black with a logo in the middle of the screen. Think PS3 boot logo. In lemans terms it causes you to see what appears to look sort of like light leak toward the edge of the bezel. This can be a deal breaker for some. However you should think about all the good that came before. Also may be an issue when viewing 4:3 content.* Long boot times = Are we there yet? This is an outstanding TV set however TV's are not just TV's anymore they are PC's and this PC, I meant TV takes long to boot. About 60-90 seconds however switching inputs is a snap.* Solid Stand = No turn or tilt. The stand that comes with the set does not move to accommodate seating locations in the room of the primary viewer and others, that said  you will have to pick a location to make ever one happy and able to see the set.* No 10 point grey scale = 2 point will have to do. The lack of 10 point is a con but the 2 point delivers better than some 10 points as mentioned above with the color and uniformity.All in all this set is deal that is hard to believe. I am a long  time HDTV enthusiast and have had all the major HDTV technologies CRT, Plasma, CCFL LCD and now LED LCD. They all have their drawbacks however this one is my current favorite. I have calibrated this set with the AVS HD 709 HDMV Calibration disk here are my settings---Picture settings menu--- Picture Mode: Custom Backlight: 40 Brightness: 45 Contrast: 44 Color: 53 Tint: 1 Sharpness: 7 ---Size & Position submenu--- [no change] ---Color Temperature submenu--- Colour temperature: Custom Red Gain: 48 Green Gain: 49 Blue gain: 50 Red offset: 49 Green offset: 48 Blue offset: 50 --Advanced Picture submenu--- Smooth motion effect: Low (Low only for 24Hz content, off for 60Hz) Real Cinema Mode: Off Noise Reduction: Off MPEG NR: Off Color Enhancement: Off Adaptive Luma: Off Film Mode: Auto Smart Dimming: On Ambient Light sensor: Off", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture & Stylin' TV", "Author": "R.

After mounting the TV to the wall and turning it on, I was AMAZED with the picture before even calibrating it. I have always owned Vizio TV's, but the picture on this model has blown my mind. The 3D is an added bonus, although I don't think I will be using it often, if at all.In order to get the best picture quality (colors, contrast, tint, sharpness, etc.) looking the best on the TV, I would recommend picking up the Disney WOW: World of Wonder [Blu-ray] Calibration blu-ray disc. It may take you a good hour or two to setup your picture right, but man it makes a HUGE difference. You know your picture is beautiful when your wife starts to make comments. :)I like the fact, although I have surround sound, that the speaker was placed at the bottom of the TV and not on the sides, that and it blends in perfectly with the black outline of the TV.The only issue I saw, and this was during the MLB 2012 Home Run Derby, was that when the ball was going into the stands you could see a little bit of ghosting on the baseball.

It was delivered to my NY address on Feb 28th; I wanted to have my husband make sure there were no issues, such as pixilation, etc. He literally turned it on for 2 or 3 mins, all seemed good; no vibration from the sound was detected at that time, but turns out to only happen at certain frequencies and we obviously didn't leave it on long enough to find that out. I did, however, notice that the box it had come in had a lot of various address stickers on it, including SAM'S CLUB. I called Amazon CS on the 28th after it showed up to inquire why that was; was this a returned/refurbished unit? The answer was no, it was most definitely a brand new unit. I asked the rep to make sure it was notated that I'd inquired about this, thinking if it did turn out to be a refurb/return and there was something wrong I hadn't detected, it would be sometime before I was in a position (with the move) to set up the unit, or even have the cable/internet hooked up at my new address to be able to detect any issues.Well, turns out, when I finally did get hooked up on April 11th I soon found out after watching an episode of \"House of Cards\" that there is a serious problem with the speakers. The vibration is intense and not all the time, at certain frequencies the sound is so bad as to be completely inaudible. I contacted Amazon again and was encouraged to go through the Vizio warranty service. I had already registered the unit with Vizio, so I did contact them. They set up an appt for someone to come out and repair the unit with a new part for May 2nd. Then I was contacted by Vizio I believe on April 30th and informed that they would not be sending repairman out, as they did not have the replacement part. They were going to send me a new unit altogether. I was taken aback and said, but I don't want a different model, would it still be this model? They said yes, it would be; but they needed me to email them a copy of the original receipt of purchase from Amazon.Here's where it gets devious and interesting. I sent them my receipt and the next contact with Vizio had them denying any responsibility and invalidating my warranty because I had purchased from an unauthorized dealer. I was mighty surprised as you can imagine, and inquired how I was supposed to be held responsible for knowing or not knowing any of that? I had purchased on Amazon, with Amazon prime shipping, and it was a brand new unit with their name on it! However, they were adamant, they were not going to do anything about it because Sam's Club should've returned any unsold units to them, rather than selling them at a discount to someone else who could then resell them. Vizio has an axe to grind, it seems and is holding the end purchaser responsible for not realizing they shouldn't be buying their products from unauthorized dealers (as I obviously should have known that)-I'm the equivalent of someone buying a hot item off the back of a truck, it seems.I got the repair service info from Vizio, as they had no problem giving me that as long as they weren't going to have to pay for it and it turned out the repair service WOULD be able to attain the replacement part (demonstrating Vizio's tactic at manipulating me into giving them the \"evidence\" they needed, in their reckoning, to invalidate my warranty). The cost of repairing the unit would be a flat fee of $349.Have contacted both Amazon and the seller Great Prices Check It Out. The seller would have offered to exchange if he had another unit, but alas. So, instead he offered to allow me to buy a soundbar from him for below his cost.

Up until recently the image quality of LCDs, Plasmas and LED LCDs was not good enough for me (mostly due to poor contrast in dark scenes).  The last time we upgraded to a TV (2004) we bought the biggest CRT out there - a 240 pound 36 inch Sony... just because the image quality of LCDs and Plasmas was so bad back then.  I had read about OLED technology that would be coming out.... but not anytime soon - so we bought the behemoth Sony CRT.  Eight years later and OLED TVs still had not arrived.  My wife had been nagging for the last few years to get a LCD or Plasma (and now with 3D and internet).... and it was getting to a time frame when I might have to pay someone to take that 240 pound Sony away... so I bit the bullet and went shopping at Costco and Best Buy.... looked at all the 3D and internet capable 55 inch models on display and then went home and did my research (mostly on Amazon).  In the stores and online, I compared reviews, editor rating, specs, passive versus active 3D  and in store image quality.  It came down to 3 passive 3D LED TVs: the Visio, a Panasonic and an LG.  I was leaning towards the Visio because of the reviews, specs, price ($1000 - $200 - $500 less than the other 2) and Costco's 2 year warranty. I then took my wife to the stores to compare the TVs. Unfortunately the Visio at Costco was poorly set so the image did not look that good, but luckily a Costco stock guy searched and found the remote and let me play with the settings.  This was impossible to do at Best Buy - we had purposely gone to both stores on a big college football day so that I could view fast action sports.  At Best Buy they could not even change the channel to let me see a game.So we bought the Visio at Costco and we are so happy.  The image quality for broadcast TV programs, DVDs and 3D Blurays is excellent.  There are several viewing settings that can be customized and saved.  Probably the most surprising thing is the speakers.  I assumed that the small size of the speaker tray at the bottom of ALL LCDs and Plasmas would necessitate sending the audio to an external system... but not with this TV.  The sound of of the TV's speakers is very good.  The internet apps selection and function are not that great but I knew this going in and knew that the 3D Bluray player we would soon upgrade to would probable have better. BTW - the Sony BDP-S590 we bought does have better functioning and a very wide selection of internet apps.

The manufacturer built a lip-sync adjustment into the software but it seems to copensate in the wrong direction in time.

Many people said it was the speed at which the device procecces the sound as compared to the complex video stream but that isn't the case since it is on very few broadcasts.

Vizio was not willing to have anybody look at it, but Amazon was more than willing to take it back. Amazon is the best. This TV has many picture settings ( maybe just too complicated for me) as I don't want to have to constantly adjust picture settings to get the quality I expected. I have a $400.00 Vizio in one of our bedrooms for guests and it has a better picture and much easier to set up and use. I was disappointed with Vizio's support team as I almost felt that they didn't care about my concerns. Even when watching a BluRay the picture was not as sharp and clear as my older Samsung.

All I can say is if you are on the fence about this one just go ahead and buy it. So thin and fairly light and perfectly bright in a room with a huge window and no shades.  A bit more glare than a few other TVs I have but not bad at all really.  The 3D using simple theater glasses (4 were included but I bought a few small kid size ones home from the recycle bin at local theater) work perfectly and the 3D is truly amazing.  I thought you needed the expensive active glasses to see good 3D at home. Now I know it's not true and in fact you can barely see a drop in brightness in 3D.  I have a drawer full of those disposable glasses from the theaters so any number of people can watch.  I thought I didn't want or need that feature but my 5 year old won't stop watching it. Our local Cox cable supplier has many free 3D programs to watch.  The image is as crisp and bright with perfect rendering of all the signals I threw at it.  I am blown away buy the crisp image and format handling and motion flow.  I thought I was cheaping out with this because of the price but I am so happy I didn't spend the extra $200-350 on another brand.  Just get it, you will not be disappointed.

It connected to my wifi easily and configuring apps was intuitive. I like the controller, it had no problem controlling my PS3, TV, and Cable Box. I guess it would be cooler if it were alluminum alloy, but it feels like my PS3 controllers, so that's good enough for me. Only 2 inches thick and was a lot lighter than my 46'in Samsung thats a couple years old. When I played a 3D PS3 game KillZone3 on it, I was amazed. My roommate and I both said the only thing we ever saw in the theatre that looked as good in 3D was Avatar, it smoked everything else. Juts be prewearned, 3D movies are EXPENSIVE ($30 a piece right now). The only place I could find them for rent was on the PlayStation Network for $7.50 a 24 hour rental (download the night before due to large file size). The only 3D and picture I saw better in store was a Sony that cost over a $1000 more, and it was barely better. The only negative thing I have to say is I accidentally smacked an HDMI cable (BTW you must get a 3D HDMI cable to watch 3D) against the screen and it made a quarter inch crack. Thatnkfully its only visible when you put a flash light up to it, but be careful with the screen. Also, I bought this through Amazon.com. I'm a Prime member and was able to schedule the exact date and time this was delivered. The guys called the same day to let me know they would be there. They were an hour late, but no big deal. They offered to let me ckeck it out before they left to verify it wasn't damaged. That's pretty nice considering I paid $0 for shipping. After I saw how good the 3D looked, I wish I would have spent the $800 more for the 65inch version! Great TV for the price. BTW-The sound built in isn't bad like what I read in other reviews. I have external studio monitors (KRK Rokit's) plugged in too for pro sound, but the built in sound was way better than what I expected after reading other reviews. I did have to go to the hardware store to get 4 6m 1inch screws to mount it on my swivel TV stand (no biggy). Cant't beat this TV for the price!

Then Vizio replaced my TV with a refurbished TV. This extended my warranty an additional 90 days but by now I had only had my TV for 10 months. The \"new\" refurbished TV began to shut off and not respond to the remote within the first few weeks. Extremely frustrating to have kids yelling that the TV cut off in the middle of the Xbox game.

It has been held its position at 4 stars. It is our only TV so it has seen many hours. It did give me a scare a few months ago with the flashing vizio logo error.

It seems the wireless connection slows down when not in use. Its completely illogical, I know, but when I know I'm going to be streaming content, the only way to get it to stream without lag is to go into the HDTV settings and \"test\" the connection which will give me the max download speeds. I do this twice to make sure I'm in the high speed range and then go open the app. If I don't do this, there is such horrible lag its unwatchable or it will time out.

Jameson \"computer teacher\"", "ReviewID": "R18O3Q1T2HIWDR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lots of great reviews, and honestly we are very impressed by this TV also. Here are some gripes though (among all of the great things):1. When using composite only (vs component) input you do plug into one of the component video connections. This means you cannot have 1 component and 1 composite input at the same time. Here's where it gets less than intuitive. Despite the fact that they saved only 1 little RCA jack by doing this, and about a half inch of space, the TV itself has 2 different input settings in the menu. One for composite only, and one for component. You will know if you have missed this because the picture will not have color if you have selected the wrong input. See, there will be a picture, just no color. Easy enough to work around, IMO silly design, but a bit confusing.2. This one you cannot work around without more equipment, and this is why I'm really hoping they do a firmware update. If you attach your computer to this TV via DVI->HDMI for a perfect picture you may be livid to discover that the dumb TV will not allow you to enable 3D options on the signal. Even at 1080p. I've narrowed this down to nothing more than the refresh rate. If the computer does 1080p at 60hz the TV refuses to allow 3D options. Even simple SBS... Apparently it only allows 24hz (which of course my computer won't do). The stupidity of this is what makes it frustrating. 60hz is MORE than 24hz, and stepping down is trivial, if that really were necessary for the 3D processing. Since the TV won't play MKV then I'd have to convert my digital content to AVI/MP4 and play them from USB at which point the TV will allow me to set 3D options. BOOO!3. The remote does sometimes go comatose. You will probably think the batteries are dead (as there is no light anywhere on the remote). So far manually turning off the TV, and then turning it back on with the remote has worked for us, but in the process I've read many complaints about this and they sometimes take hours to resolve. On the same note some apps don't seem to recognize the QWERTY keyboard and you're back to arrow keys. The Twitter app has a retweet option but it doesn't work (I doubt that's Vizio's fault).4. The audio out to feed your stereo does not respond to the TV volume control. That means of course that if you use a stereo the volume control on the TV becomes pointless. Maybe this is a matter of preference, but the option would be nice. I'm only using composite, perhaps the optical output works differently?So those are my only gripes among a LOT of impressive factors. I've been especially impressed by it's HDMI audio source detection. As I said before I connect my computer via DVI->HDMI which means there is no audio on the HDMI. The TV is brilliant, it detects this and switches to the RCAs!

Your Opinion May Differ (YOMD)First needed to decide active vs. passive 3D. Chose passive 3D because I look at a monitor almost all day, didn't want the flicker when I watch TV as well. Read a lot of reviews and even tried to see some jagged lines that were supposed to appear in 3D. I have watched about 10 3D movies, liked the 3D very much, and still haven't found those jagged lines all reviews talked about. So I have to conclude that only purists can see those and I definitely am not a purist. YOMDOnce I decided for passive, I had to make a choice between LG and Vizio. I didn't like Toshiba (brightness, contrast etc.).I finally decided to go with Vizio because of the following reasonsComparable and cheaper.240 HZ takes care of the brightness that I wantedI liked the 3D. Also a thing to consider is that 3D is not prevalent yet. Things may change in a couple of years but I will not hold my breath and buy a TV today for content which is coming (?)10000000:1 is awesome. This is a spec from the manufacturer. I can differentiate between various shades of black.Preset modes for picture are decent. But you may have to customize according to your tastes4 HDMI ports should be a lot. especially because XBOX 360 (older ones if they are still working) and Wii dont have HDMI ports. :) You are not going to get much more than 4 HDMI ports on any TV.About 70 lbs (with 52 lb TV + base) is not the state of art thin and light but definitely not very heavy.Things I did not likeVizio Apps (but this is a software issue and can be updated in future, also your PS3/3D blu-ray player can resolve this as well)Menu options can be made a little more intuitive to useResponse while using internet apps can be improved (but a wired connection to your 3D Bluray player may perform better)Reflection on the screen is a little problematic, would have expected it to be matte but its not.Sound is decent.

Does not matter if it's set on standard sound or surround sound; when you turn up the volume you get the reverb. I've had to constantly adjust the picture trying to get a decent color and brightness. I am certainly not impressed with this \"LED edge lighting\". My older 55\" Vizio Led TV puts this new Vizio to shame. After reading about how this TV won awards and reviews in 2011 I decided to take a chance and order it from Amazon (Triton Wholesale). Even though it was about $200 more than I had seen from Amazon a few months before I decided it would be worth it. Well----my mistake.I may have waited too late but I'm going to check on returning this set. Very disappointed.Also, the White Glove service provided by Ceva was good, but when they left I realized they had cut the bottom off the Vizio box instead of just opening the flap. They did this in their truck before they brought in the TV.This will make it difficult to box up for return since they did not leave me the bottom of the box.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price.", "Author": "Gene Schwartz", "ReviewID": "R11DMRD8UAZO1A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy anything from GPCK INC. Pat Cook runs the business and is a criminal. If you try to call his business listed on the Internet, you will get a message that his phone number is not available. The HDTV we purchased from him worked for 5 weeks. After that time, the picture was horrible. He promised to replace the HDTV for at least three months and never fulfilled his promise. We were unable to repair the HDTV because he would not enter the warranty requirements for our TV. Vizio would not accept our warranty request because we did not purchase the HDTV from an authorized dealer (although the product was sent from an authorized dealer directly to us). Besides not purchasing anything from GPCK INC.I recommend you not purchase any Vizio products; the parts are hare to find and they have terrible customer support (if you call them, they talk about how highly they are recommended by J.D. Power in customer satisfaction, which is a fallacy). Final note - Do not buy anything from GPCK INC. or Vizio. Also, I will not purchase anything more from Amazon. They promote their A to Z guarantee from anything purchased from their web site. This is not realistic. Their guarantee lasts for 14 days. We received our HDTV ten days after our Amazon purchase and the HDTV worked for several weeks. We paid to get the HDTV repaired and and have no warranty for a new product.
