I must say i was a little weary do to the fact that it is a 720p and not a 1080p (all i have owned is 1080p).  Once I have hooked it up I really cannot complain, being 32\" its very hard to tell the nuance differences in 720p & 1080p, im sure if the TV was bigger there might be a viewing issue.This was purchased for our bedroom where 32\" is the PERFECT size anything smaller is hard to see and anything bigger belongs in a Bachelors bedroom which i am not.Amazon as usual had the BEST price available on this TV & even if they didn't they will price match for you ! How wonderful is that !This is the 3rd Samsung TV we have owned (recently purchased a 58\" 3dtv which is amazing) and literally have ZERO complaints ! I tried researching this TV before purchasing with no such luck, i literally couldn't find a single review. My only GRIPE (if you want to call it that) is that the LED is a little cartoony, this is the first LED tv we have owned so it will take some getting used to, but the overall picture is perfect !This 32\" is a bit HIGH when compared to other brands, BUT it is Samsung whom i think takes the CAKE in TV manufacturing (Sony is a close 2nd).  So for those of you wanting a 32\" and not wanting to go with a Sharp-Onyo-Vizio, This TV is for you it also has 2 HDMI ports which is more then enough for what we are using it for.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Picture no Audio Out", "Author": "Mike R", "ReviewID": "R1PE1TA3ES3XJ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from Amazon on Monday and reveived it on Wednesday.  I was looking for a TV for our bedroom and based on the reviews and price this set looked to fit the bill. After hooking it up and adjusting the picture it seemed to work great for my needs.  Then I started looking for the audio out and/or hedphone jacks so I could hook it up to my ZVOX audio system.  To my suprise this set has neither.  Wow I have not seen a TV without audio out or headphone jacks in the last 20 years. What were they thinking?  I was able to hook up my ZVOX system to the cable box but it is not the best arrangement.

It has excellent picture quality, easy to follow instructions, and easy setup.  Easy to attach to PC by means of HDMI cable.  A potentially serious shortcoming is lack of any audio output.  Because of hearing difficulty we sometimes use wireless headphones.  There is NO way to connect these directly to the TV, we have to connect them to a cable box.  My old CRT TV which this replaced had audio output as well as headphone connections.  The audio out allowed headphones and built-in speaker use while the headphone connection muted built in speakers.  I thought this was pretty standardized and didn't even think to check when I bought this TV.

However, it being a samsung tv and an LED, I was almost assured that it would be a good buy. Having had the tv for about a week and a half now I am very impressed. The picture is as good as any larger 1080p televisions and it also very visually striking because it is so thin being an LED, and also just the overall design is fantastic, because I found most 32\" tv's to be quite ugly. I was able to buy it with a 10% AMEX code, so my total was 359.99 and for that price I don't think theres a better 32\" tv on the market. The speakers are the only thing about the tv that is not phenomenal, but im planning on buying a small logitech system to fix that, and that is only because I'm an audiophile and love quality sound, for everyday usage the speakers are fine, but if you are looking for something that sounds good even at high volumes then a cheap surround sound will make a world of difference.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Audio Outs", "Author": "Dr.Roland", "ReviewID": "RVCOLSSRUV69C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had the TV for a bit more than a week, I was trying to find the headphone jack, and could not find it.

Bui \"Fish\"", "ReviewID": "R3H889E4293LGX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY THIS TV! GO WITH THE LATER MODELS!This is my first samsung television and im not a tech buff im just sharing what i think.I gave it 1 star because they came out with a newer model for a few more bucks which has all of the \"cons\" about this television solved.This is a great tv dont get me wrong but for a modernized television i would stray away from this one.  spend the extra few bucks and get the later model which has alot more options you can work with.I own one. picture quality is great. however i never owned a 1080p television but this ones only 720p.  If i didnt get a deal i couldnt refuse on this television i would have gotten a better model.Pros: Great picture, easy to use, light weight, super thin, cool button-less touch buttons (im not sure what you call these but pretty much you just have to touch the spot on the television where the on/off buttons are and they function kinda like a touch screen) HOWEVER! there is a con to this feature as well because in a dark room its very hard to find where the buttons are.  They blend in with the black boarder of the tv.  regardless cool feature but they should improve it more by making them stick out more like say beveled touch buttons or just put the buttons on the side of the television if you want to hide them.  Another con about the buttons is that they are VERY sensitive.  Im not sure if this is a con or not but if your moving the television while its plugged in (which is probably not recommended by people) i tend to turn on or off the television by accident.Cons: horrible speakers, could use more hdmi, needs vga, needs aux input, needs more RCAs, not 1080p (i only say this because most tv's that are sold today are all 1080p), usb option should be placed in a better place.  I dont see anyone going out of their way to plug a usb in behind the tv to listen to music or see pictures everytime you want to use that function.  I guess if your television is on a stand its not too bad but when mounted up on a flat wall its anoying to move the tv just to do that.  Usb function is somewhat slow as well.  Takes forever for television to read the files and the \"OS\" that operates the usb sucks but you cant expect much since its not a pc.More about the television:If you want to hook up external speakers such as surround sound speakers, the only way to do this is through a dvd, blu-ray, your cable box (assuming it has RCA outputs).  Almost all modernized televisions today have direct input.  I dont think its possible to hook up \"computer\" speakers via 3.5mm or via the RCA provided to this television.  If someone has successfully done so please let me know how because the samsung techs are clueless.  They told me that the \"antenna\" plug behind the television is a 3.5mm output...this is false...the manual even says its for antenna service.  it however does take a 3.5mm plug tho but im not sure exactly what its used for.Let me phrase this again.  If you want to hook up computer speakers to this television you can only do it via a RCA to 3.5mm converter (red and white plug to the back of the tv and have a 3.5mm female on the other end of the plug).  This however will probably only work for something like say your Xbox or PS3 because you have to change the mode that your tvs in.** READ ON:  THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR WATCHING SHOWS ON YOUR TV!  The only way i can get sound out of my TV SHOWS is if i use the RCA on my DVR (cable box) to my external speaker receiver.  You can probably used the same RCA to 3.5mm on the cable box and hook computer speakers up to it to get sound.The point is, I havent found a direct method of hooking up speakers to this tv to get sound out of the TV shows yet.  but its not impossible. if you buy the later models this would make your life easier and would probably make more sense.ANOTHER BIG ISSUE AND HUGE REASON WHY I GAVE IT 1 STAR!THIS NEXT SECTION WILL DEAL WITH MOUNTING THE TV!IF U DONT PLAN ON MOUNTING IT SKIP THE NEXT PART:for some reason samsung uses \"M8\" screws and not standard size mounting screws.  If you buy a tv mount, the majority of them are \"versa\" compliant.  In other words they are universal screws that MOST tvs have.  If you buy THIS PARTICULAR SAMSUNG MODEL (32\" 4003) YOU WILL BE MAKING A TRIP TO HOME DEPOT!I purchased the following mount on amazon: \"Articulating LCD LED HDTV Tilt / Swivel TV Wall Mount Bracket\" by typing in the tv model.  *** THE MOUNT WILL TELL YOU THAT IT WORKS FOR THIS TV! IT DOESNT!!!!! the screws provided with the mount will work for the later samsung models.  the screws provided are M8 BUT they are TOO SHORT!  The sellers of this mount assumes that M8 means it will work for this tv.  If you compare this tv model to the later versions of it and pay attention to the mounting part behind the tv, you will find that youll need a 1-1/4\" M8 screw.  Usually the screws provided are about M8 .5\" or something.The point of this is: If u plan on buying this TV, get ready to make a trip to homedepot and look at their section for screws and look for a BLACK M8 screw.  If you have no idea what a M8 screw looks like, it will be black in color and in order to screw it into the tv you need a HEX (hexagon) key.  After buying the proper size screw your going to want to buy 2 washers per screw as well.  DO NOT USE A HEX key to mount the screws in!The head on the m8 screw is big enough for you to manually with your fingers tighten the screw enough to keep the tv on the mount.  You can use the hex keys but this will probably break your tv if you improperly screw it in too tight.  I just tightened it with my fingers until it stopped turning which is tight enough.FYI, This has nothing to do with the tv but the mount that was purchased: \"Articulating LCD LED HDTV Tilt / Swivel TV Wall Mount Bracket\" is a good mount but it will not keep my tv leveled.  Everytime i move the tv (which i do alot) when its on its mount, i have to readjust the tv to be leveled.  THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WALL. Its just the way the joint that attaches the TV to the Mount and theres not really much you can do except tighten the bolt but that might damage the screw since i tightened it enough.  But this wasnt a reason why i gave it 1 star.I know this was alot of me rambling about my ignorance about televisions but im pretty sure there are other normal people like me out there who arnt tech savy and are just looking to buy the right television.  I had to make 3 trips to homedepot before i decided to bring the darn television to homedepot to find the proper screw before i left that place.  Of course this was only possible because the tv was light enough for me to do so.To sum it up i would not recommend this tv to anyone unless it was a deal you couldnt refuse.  Picture quality is great! But functionality wise, it lacks so much options that would make anyones life easier.Feel free to email me if you have any questions, ive been playing with this television for the past month and i think i did enough research, customer service calling, and fiddling around and can share my small knowledge of this television with you and to push you away from buying it.  But if you own it already i am glad to learn from you or share with you what i know.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Reasons to pass on this TV", "Author": "Ralphie", "ReviewID": "R14BZ148QDQE2V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The edges of the display are brighter than the rest of the picture.

You usually just have to buy the TV, try it and return it if it did not have a low power setting and start looking again.When we called Samsung support for this information we talk to only one person who was in the US and spoke english, what a surprise.

The screen is very bright, and the sound is really good though not necessarily fantastic. The colors aren't amazing either, but they're as good as most flat screens of this size. The blacks aren't that dark, and you can definitely see edge lighting when the images on screen get darker, which kind of upsets me. It's not so much that it's distracting, but it's still clearly noticeable. Although the color quality isn't the best, the definition of the images is fantastic. The bezel is small and looks very nice, as does the stand, a trait that I've found is mostly consistent in Samsung TVs. The TV itself is also very lightweight and extremely easy to set up.If you don't really care about color quality, contrast ratio, or deep blacks, this is a great TV.Edit: After reading through the manual for a bit, I discovered that whoever owned the TV before I got it had set with a high brightness and low contrast, thus explaining the previous issues. After toying with the settings for some time, I got them to a point that makes a very good display. The only problem I've found with it now is that when the camera pans quickly, there's a slight after-image on the screen.

After comparing all available sets in this size this one stood out the most.  It has a great thin profile 1.25\" which worked great for mounting it on the wall, the picture clarity was far greater than any of the cheaper similar sets with a dynamic (motion) contrast ratio of 20,000:1 vs most cheaper sets offering 6 to 10,000.  While it does come with two hdmi, component, av, and a USB, they are all on the back and perpendicular to the set, it would be more ideal to have them paralell to screen so that when mounting this on the wall the cables dont stick out towards the wall.  The USB is not very useful being located in the back, you have to run a USB extension cord to effectively connect devices on the fly.  The sounds is the one true flaw, there is no sound output, so connecting a receiver is impossible unless doing so through a cable box or blu ray player.
