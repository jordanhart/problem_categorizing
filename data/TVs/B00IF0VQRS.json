It'll be years before 4k is worth it, so I picked this baby up.I have to say, even though I had sell my car and start renting my house out to college students (me and my wife and kid rotate couch, chair, floor, easy compromise!), I STILL got the better end of the deal.They're not joking when they say interactive.  For the low, low price of $35,000 -ish, I basically bought a portal to Narnia.  This TV works a lot like that mirror in the Matrix, you know where Neo puts his finger in the mirror and it eats him.  Yeah, just like that except you don't wake up in some slimy tube somewhere.Instead, you pop out on the other side of the TV in whatever you were watching.  Cinemax has become an entirely new experience!  Buy this.  Sell all of your possessions.  Are you married?  Have a family?  I did too, but cutting them loose was super easy with this thing.  Just jump into your favorite show, hide in the background and wait for them to change the channel - boom!Instruction manual is pretty weak though.  Took me a while to figure out how to not exit the TV into some specialty electronics store.  I don't know who was more suprised - me or the customer service rep trying to sell this TV to some poor idiot with a wife and kid in tow.Hope he bought it.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Had to take 1 star off", "Author": "electronicreviewer96", "ReviewID": "RNZNHJBVFI9XT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok so first of all, this is basically a steal at $35,849 because I saw this same one at BestBuy for $35,850 so Amazon really saved me. I had to take one star off because I had to completely disassemble it to fit it through my dorm door, then piece it back together which took several days and now I have weird spots on my screen. I also had to move my roommate's bed next to mine to fit it in our room. And last night, oh boy, he had Chipotle for dinner. That was a terrible night! All because of how friggin big this TV is. Other than that, I was completely satisfied with shipping and handling and thought the interactivity really adds to the TV.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IF0VQRS"}}
