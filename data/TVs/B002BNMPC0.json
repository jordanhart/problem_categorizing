The picture is outstanding and the Home Theater Store in Houston not only came up with an outstanding price but excellent service. Try to buy from this store. They are the best.Yes, the tuner is a little slow but 99% of us are going to use this set with HDMI sources like a HD cable or Satellite box - right? No flaws in the display but you have to open the little door on the remote and find the A/V mode that suits your environment. This set has a huge number of \"knobs to turn\" as far as setting up the picture so be careful and find the mode and settings that you need. Once you get it set - it will blow you away.Yes, the sound isn't what you got out of the 250# \"console\" TV that you just replaced. It has small speakers because it's a flat panel TV. They are all that way. So stop complaining and go buy yourself a little 5.1 channel sound system that has an optical input. Hook it to the optical output of this set and the Cable or Sat box (see below) and it will be the best show you have ever heard or seen. Better yet, go buy yourself one that has a DVD upconvert or Blue Ray DVD player in it. The LG LHT854 on Amazon is a good example (for less than $200). Buy your optical and HDMI cables here on Amazon too and save a lot of $$. All the hype you read about certain cables being better is wrong. They don't need to be gold or start with \"M\". Speaker cables don't need to be big, fat and hard to work with. Unless you are running 2000 watts or more, 18 or 16 gauge wire is just fine. It's all digital data so there is no way the optical or HDMA cable can effect the quality of the sound or video. Be sure to connect your optical sound cable from your cable or Sat box directly to your sound system so you don't pick up a delay from the TV processing it. IF your sound system has only one optical input, buy an optical splitter/combiner on Amazon for a couple of dollars and combine the optical sources from the TV and cable or Sat box. This all works.Sharp has taken the most appropriate road on LED backlighting in my view,simply replace the florescent system with proven technology that was developed for the laptop industry by leaders like Apple. It's very bright and even.Since writing the above review, I have become even more sold on this product. Sharp has a fairly small market share in this field so they try hard to support their users. They offer a program called Aquos Advantage. It includes 3 mo.of warranty extension and a newsletter with info on using their products. It also includes a REAL help line you can call to get help if you don't understand something or can't make a feature work. If you are new to HDTV this may be of value to you. They also have a Facebook page and are very responsive through that site. The bigger manufactures may have these contacts as well but Sharps people seem to care about each customer.The other thing I have noticed is the quality of the graphics engine. I connected my 3 year old standard def (480P) DVD player to the set using the \"component\" connection and the picture is as good or better than from an HDMI-connected Up-convert player. This indicates that the graphics engine in this set is outstanding.When you get yours, open the little door on the bottom of the remote control and check out the different preset video modes.

Misleading in that the set itself is surprising more beautiful than this image shows. And there is a blue light V-shaped symbol in the center of the bottom horizontal frame. That might strike some as tacky but in fact, it's a rather nice understated touch. Another surprise is just how light it is. You can easily pick it up and move it with no strain. Try that win an old Trinitron CRT set.The picture stunned. I was completely surprised by how great it is. It has deep rich color, uniform brightness and as critical as I am (Only the Sony XBR8 RGB LED Sony has impressed me, until now) I have to say for the price, it tells me that full-array (LEDs completely cover the back, instead of just being around the edges) can be done well and at a price that will sell.Assuming the set proves reliable, with no negative surprises, it's going to cause Sony and Samsung a real price headache.

We have three game consoles attached, incl. the Blu-Ray player as part of the Sony PS3. It is in our family room and is used several hours a day (I'm ashamed to admit).On the plus side:Fabulous picture, after some adjusting. There are a zillion adjustments on the TV, so if you spend some time, you can get a wonderful, uniform picture with great contrast and color saturation.The black matte finish of the screen does away with all but the most severe (i.e., bright) light sources that might reflect from the screen.Price.Sharp Aquos brand.No spotlighting or banding as one person mentioned -- very uniform lighting.LOTS of inputs. (8 to be exact -- most, but not all are HDMI)Easy to update firmware when available (did it yesterday).On the negative side:The built-in speakers. Way too soft, even on the loudest setting. Since we didn't want to have our stereo system on all the time, I attached an unused set of desktop computer speakers I had lying around the house. Now we have better sound than probably any built in TV speakers. Great solution that I recommend to anyone purchasing this TV. Of course, this is an issue with all flat screen TV's to some extent: tinny sound and lacking in volume, even for everyday use. (Get some computer speakers, preferably like those I have that do not have an on/off switch but switch themselves on/off when there is a signal. Piece of cake.)All the adjustments you can make to the picture! Well, not a negative, but it takes awhile to find your way around all the adjustments, and Sharp is not good about explaining them. The out-of-the-box setup was not optimal: reds were a little pinkish, the picture was not quite bright enough, etc., but after some tweaking I have a spectacular picture.When changing channels, there is a \"fade effect\" between channels that is annoying. I have not been able to figure out how not to get this effect. (There is a \"fade effect\" in the menu, but disabling it has no effect.)Summary:If you haven't seen a full array LED LCD TV, you're in for a treat. Don't let the premium priced Samsung LED LCD's tempt you either, because their LED's are all on the edges. This has a full array behind the screen so that the picture is much brighter (when adjusted) and more uniform. Buy this and get some computer speakers.

I will also say that I could be wrong about the possible options for changing what I dislike about this TV, or in my description of what causes it- but in my research so far I haven't found any reason to believe so.  I'm always interested in hearing more information if I don't have the full picture though.All that said- I personally just don't like this set so much.  I bought this to replace a broken Sony XBR6 (also 32\"), and this has been my experience so far, the good and bad.Good:- Picture quality:  The picture quality on this thing really is amazing.  Very deep blacks, crystal clear image.  I had to tweak the settings a bit (I'll get to my thoughts on that shortly), and never quite found a setting that I thought was perfect, but even with that being the case the picture was stunning and I can tell that with proper calibration it's probably one of the best 32\" sets you can buy as far as PQ goes right now.-Picture settings.  I'm actually kind of split on this.  The picture definitely needs to be tweaked from store settings, and the good thing is that this set provides probably the most extensive set of options for calibration than any other set I've seen- so chances are you CAN get it where you like it.  It's kind of a double edged sword though because there's so many settings that unless you really know your stuff it's difficult to figure out how to get the perfect balance.Bad:- Sound:  Sound on 32\" flat panels has never been known to be that great, but I almost immediately felt that the sound was very hollow and tinny compared to the xbr6.  I messed with the audio settings- turned on the surround simulator and upped the bass a little bit.  That helped, but I still found it lacking.-Build quality/Styling:  This is something that may just come down to opinion (styling is for sure), but I was rather unhappy with both of these things compared to my xbr.  The build quality feels cheap and not very sturdy by comparison, and the styling in general I just felt was bland.  The same feeling extended to the system menus for me- I like the design and look of the Sony's much more, whereas the Sharps feel more like a 90's computer menu or something.-Remote:  Weird choices for how they laid the remote out... the button to switch 'av modes' (basically profiles for picture settings etc) is enclosed in a little drawer so you have to open that whenever you want to switch  between your movie/game/custom modes etc.  In general I also feel the remote is just kind of ugly...-Motion processing:  This was the big one for me.  Everyhing else being as is (although the styling still bugs me), I would have been willing to keep this set just for it's image quality.  But this was a deal breaker.  I've read on other sites that the Sharp ranks low in this area, especially compared to Sony, and I completely agree.  Now this is where I believe it's possible i'm missing some information but I haven't found it yet.  With TV based content it looks fine, but what seems to be the case is that you cannot turn off the 'film mode' image processing for any progressive signal based content (480p/720p/1080p).  You can see the setting in the menu, but it is disabled (along with one other setting for the black levels I think)- and YES I am in 'dot by dot' mode.What this effectively means (at least as far as my eyes can tell), is that there is no way to turn off the 'soap opera effect' on blu-ray content (and probably progresive-scan dvd as well I haven't tried that yet).  I looked this up on forums and messed with every setting possible and I just could not get rid of it.  Some people don't mind that effect, some like it, some say it's not even noticeable, but to me it sticks out like a sore thumb and I just hate it.  So for me, I think this set will be going back in favor of the xbr9 or un32b6000 (hoping that doesn't have any similar issues).So I'm giving this set a 3 stars- if I could I'd probably give it 3.5.  I'm not that concerned with the fact that it's led or not, or that it doesn't have local dimming- all I care about as far as that stuff goes is picture quality, and this set is extremely high up when it comes to that.  Unfortunately I just found almost every other aspect of the set, most notably the inability to turn film mode off on blu-ray content, to be unsatisfactory.  It's a great value for the price, but at the same time, I can see why the price is much lower than the competitors in it's class.UPDATE:I'm going to bump this up to 4 stars, for a reasons that ultimately led me to keep it.  First off, I found he game mode turns all processing off (even though the film mode is inaccessible with progressive content, I believe it is stuck 'off' in this mode instead of stuck 'on'), which I didn't know at first.  And while I stand by my belief that the extensive picture controls may be intimidating for those that are less tech savvy and just want to be able to turn on and sit back, the controls were really great for doing a calibration with DVE.  I actually picked up an xbr 9 and compared the two because I was having such a hard time choosing a set, and I was able to get the DVE disc calibration settings PERFECT with the sharp, while the xbr's limited controls wouldn't allow it.  With the calibration settings set on the game mode profile, things are looking a lot better for me.I still stand by everything I said before though.  The build quality, sound, remote layout, and the fact that the other profiles are pretty much useless to me with progressive content are all downers, but with the picture this thing puts out side by side with the xbr9, it was absolutely no contest... I had to stick with the sharp, and I've actually been very happy with the decision  (the xbr9 also has several other factors that I think were a step down from the xbr6, so that might have helped)  4 stars!", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good all-rounder, BUT...", "Author": "S.

Plain and simple. Definitely impressive stuff compared to my other two LCD's in the house.Nothing dead, nothing stuck, no flashlighting, and no banding. Another reviewer mentioned these problems but from what I have experienced and what I have heard from others this is a near non existent problem.Deep customization for adjusting hue, saturation, tint etc etc allowing for really fine tuning. Personally this has been more of a con but its only because I'm too cheap to pay for calibration.Great, vibrant colors in general with a picture that has \"Pop\".Cons:The included remote really isn't that great. I don't enjoy the buttons themselves nor the layout. Of the Phillips, Sanyo, and Toshiba's I have used recently I would say this isn't the worst but not as nearly as good as the Toshiba's. Whatever, not much of a con but it's true. You can always use a universal.As good as the colors are...your gonna need some calibrating to get this one right.

Terrible Sound.", "Author": "Joshua Zyber", "ReviewID": "R10SKDZ8PV22Y3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was in desperate need of a 1080p 32\" HDTV that would fit into the existing entertainment cabinet in my living room, which is exactly 31\" wide. You'd be amazed at how difficult it is to find a 32\" LCD that meets that requirement. Most are around 31.5\", which is very close but just wouldn't fit.Long story short: The set has gorgeous picture quality. No complaints at all about that. Unfortunately, the speakers are extremely tinny and just plain awful. The limited audio controls in the setup menu allow you to adjust treble and bass. I wound up pulling treble almost all the way to the bottom to temper the scratchy highs, and then nudging bass up a bit. But don't turn the bass up too high, or the speakers will distort during loud noises. The best I can get it still sounds far worse than the 20 year-old standard-def set that this is replacing. This TV really requires the use of a separate audio system. In my case, that means I'm going to have to find a soundbar that will also fit my cabinet. I hadn't planned on that.The television is fairly easy to set up. My only disappointment there is that the set only offers a 4:3 pillarbox mode on standard-def input signals. HD input signals are locked to 16:9. Because the upconverting DVD/Blu-ray player I plan to use with this TV doesn't offer a pillarbox mode either, I'm going to have to train my wife to set the player for 480p output whenever she wants to watch her beloved Gilmore Girls DVDs, and then set it back to 1080p afterwards. Or else she'll have to watch them stretched, which neither of us finds acceptable. That's going to be a big nuisance (with a long learning curve, undoubtedly).

I bought this model due to finding out Sharp manufacturer their own VA-panel (Though they call their version ASV or Advanced Super View. \"VA\" and \"IPS\" panels has wide viewing angles and better than \"TN\" panels found in cheaper LCD). This model have 'full-array LED backlight' which means LED filled the entire back of the panel, not just the edges. Unfortunately, it does not have local dimming feature. Don't bother with the 120hz spec because they achieved it through dithering. These 120hz LCD, as of writing, do not actually accept 120hz input signal.Aesthetic/external impressions:The TV is quite light for its size. The plastic exterior is glossy black, but in term of build quality it's pretty standard. The stand is very sturdy, unfortunately can't swivel. The screen surface is soft like computer monitors, it doesn't have a thick protection. Overall, Sharp skim on the bodywork of the TV, so if your purpose is to impress friends and neighbors, this TV isn't it.Positive points:-Image quality: Amazing image quality and details for this price range. This quality is worthy to be in a TV twice the cost. Very colorful and smooth. The screen is neither matte nor gloss, its in the middle. I'm mostly impressed by the contrast, lots of shadow details. There is a little 'color banding' which you'll only find if you do specific tests to revel it, its not possible to notice during movies.-Backlight uniformity and black level: Excellent. In the dark, I set the TV to show a black screen and took photos of it using my camera set to 1/4th seconds exposure. The idea is to have the taken photo reveal any backlight leakage... there was none from what my camera could make out. It is very rare to find an LCD that has no backlight leakage! The full-array LED backlight really does a good job here.-Viewing angle: Excellent. When they say 176* degree horizontally and vertically, they mean it. Though the colors lose some saturation when viewing off angle, but this is minimal. The color that suffers the most is red, if its not a dark shade it might turn pinkish from an angle.Power consumption:This TV is very energy efficient. By my measurement, at factory setting it consumes 61w. With backlight brightness set at 25% it consumes 49w. At lowest setting, 37w.-Response rate: I notice minimal ghosting for videos. However, I do for 3D gaming (connected to my computer video card running high frame rates), but its not bad enough to distract from the experience.Negative points:-Menu/setting screen: Some people might find the menu screen bland to look at, the graphic look old and blocky. Again, it won't impress your friends.-Speakers: The internal speakers quality won't be that great. It's a bit trebly. You'll want to turn the 'Treble' value from 0 to -6.-No 1080p input support for analog PC input (RGB-15pins): Many competitor brands allow 1080p resolution through PC connection. Through the PC connection with this Sharp, you are allowed up to 1600x1200 pixels max, but its ugly looking. You'll have to use 720p resolution (1360x768) for the image to look good.-The infamous red and green tint: I have witness many LCD suffers from this with varying degrees. With the one I received, it has a pillar of green tint in the middle and the right side is pinkish, these are noticeable when the screen is showing a static white background or very light color. Since I use this TV as my computer monitor, I notice it while viewing the web. Do not worry about this if you are using this TV for its proper purpose: to watch TV and videos, you won't notice it then.HINT for gamers: If you play any games at all, you should change the AV mode to GAME. To do this, open the 'cap' in the bottom of the remote and press 'AV MODE'. The STANDARD mode with HDMI connection has input lag such that the cursor on the screen moved a quarter second after you move your mouse.Calibrating the monitor:It is clear that by default the color temperature has a blue tint. Try turning the 'Color Temperature' from Middle to Mid-Low. Also the color red is pinkish, to fix it, I changed the Red value for \"C.M.S.-Value\" from 0 to -10. Also the colors are a bit saturated, I set 'Color' from 0 to -4.My 'colorimeter' that I regularly use to calibrate colors for computer monitors works with this thin screen TV. (Generally it don't work with thick screen TVs). The colorimeter can adjust the colors automatically if you have a PC connected, now the TV is showing very accurate colors with no blue tint.Overall:I would recommend this LCD TV if you care most about image quality and don't mind that the physical exterior of the TV isn't made of more expensive materials.PRO:-Excellent image quality, great contrast-Perfect backlight uniformity, great black level-Very, very wide viewing angle, however colors can lose some saturation-Fast response rate, input lag is good with GAME mode, absolutely horrendous with other modes-Low power consumptionCON:-Menu/setting screen is bland looking-Speakers quality not great-analog PC input (RGB-15pins) does not accept 1080p resolution, only look good with 720p-The one I received have a green and red tint over large part of the screen, noticeable with static white background", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everything I need in a TV", "Author": "Frank S.", "ReviewID": "R3W2L3UZZSNTKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sharp Aquos 32\" LED/LCD hybrid works perfectly as our second TV.

Sellers", "ReviewID": "R163636CEVMGMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before I bought this TV and read all the reviews - They were mostly good for this HDTV-but a few were really bad. I don't understand why ANY were bad. For me, this has been a really great tv. Initially I thought there was a problem with the speakers which had been mentioned in some reviews, so I purchased  computer speakers from Best Buy. I hooked them up using an adapter and wow the sound was great! Then I had to exchange my DVR with the cable company and realized the TV speakers were just fine- it was the old DVR box that was giving me the weak sound. Still I think the additional speakers add a lot and are worth it.  Now it sounds like I have a really cool sound system! The suggestions on this review site on how to adjust the colors and tones was very helpful. Definitely pay attention to the suggestions and use them if you don't quite like the skin tone colors when you first get the tv. It took a little adjusting to get them right with the high def, but overall if was pretty darn easy. Pluses: the tv is very lightweight and it was very easy connecting everything up once my old tv was disconnected. I admit I still haven't figured out how to turn off the blue light at the bottom of the tv ( I didn't read the entire book of instructions), but since the blue light is so cool I'm not bothered by it anyway.Cons- Yes it does take a second or two for the television to come on (lag time), but that doesn't bother me at all. I'm not a gamer. I just love my tv programs and watching them on this beautiful screen is quite a treat.  The colors are bright - I've had no problem with things being too dark as some reviews have mentioned.  Overall, I wouldn't worry at all about purchasing this tv. You'll be very happy with it. My only disappointment is that I didn't purchase a slightly bigger tv. Now I realize I could have.  One more thing; The remote is large and kind of plain, but I didn't buy it for the remote. I can always buy a combo remote and since I almost always use the cable rermote (which is also clunky and cumbersome), it's really not a big deal.  The tv price went down about a week after I got mine so I wish I'd waited a week to get the lower price, but overall, I'm still happy and would definitely recommend this tv.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow!

It was like the technology wasn't quite there yet.When LED back-lit TVs came out, I was more hopeful but the prices were outrageous.  Then I found the Sharp Aquos LED set and the price wasn't bad.  Most stores don't carry Sharp even though they are a leader in LCD TVs but we found a 40\" version at Bestbuy and were very pleased with the picture quality so we decided to go for it. You might consider using Google Shopping to find a better price.  PowersellerNYC had a set including tax and free delivery for just under $700.  Your cable provider will likely provide the HDMI connector cable so don't let them talk you into buying one.How good is the Sharp Aquos?Wow! I couldn't be happier with the picture quality from this 32\" set.  High-definition programing will just blow you away with the crisp outlines and truly black tones.  It's almost distracting how clear the nearly 3-D quality is.  No blotchy skin tones or blurry lines on this set.Using the TV is relatively easy.  The only adjustment I made was to tone down the brightness a bit but left everything else on factory setting.  We will probably add speakers to the set but the built-in versions are quite decent enought.If you thought you never saw an LCD TV with good enough picture quality, you should consider the Sharp LED version.

Isenberg \"jonbegood2u\"", "ReviewID": "RXE98WHDPLAVA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I must confess being almost completely baffled with my assessment to date of this much hyped new product offering from Sharp. After looking and reading multiple reviews regarding HDTV'S for at least 2 months, I decided to go with the Sharp in spite of not being able to locate one in a retail store in my geographic area. This in retrospect was not a great idea even though I have purchased many other products on line virtually without disappointment.First the Good: I am pleasantly surprised to discover that the sound quality of the internal speakers in this flat screen is much better than anticipated (although I have it connected to a bose computer speaker system which I already owned.) The overall materials quality appearance of the TV and remote control are also very nice.I must say that the TV remote is rather large but that attests to the relative complexity of this product offering. The blue glowing Sharp light is really unique and cool--it you don't like it then you can turn the light off as an option.The Not So Good: My daughter and I are not crazy about the Sharp's picture quality with a nagging tendancy towards being too dark. The rendering of the color black is sometimes exaggerated to the point of looking like that part of the image is totally missing. Yes there are numerous picture settings available but the point is that it should look very good without a struggle to make it so thru repeated adjustments! We have it set to Auto mode at present time because it seems to \"average out\" the video image overall without as many undesireable visual surprises.I also don't find the image as crisp and clear as a small Toshiba 720p flat screen which I am using in my bedroom. In fact, although going for about half the price, the Toshiba seems to have a much better image without the need to make any adjustments to the picture. I am even considering upgrading my Dish TV to HD in an effort to improve the Sharp's image, since it does not render analog very well.Other Considerations: I also purchased a Sharp blu ray player and the interconnectivity between both products is excellent.I think it fair to say that overall both my daughter and I are disappointed with this Sharp LED product. I am glad others are seemingly having more positive results.
