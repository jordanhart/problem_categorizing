{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Slim and beautiful but sub-par picture quality", "Author": "Christian Cote \"RadXGe\"", "ReviewID": "R3OU39UBKN878B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been playing with a new Samsung UN32C4000 for a week now and the following contains the results of my findings.1)Basic FeaturesThis monitor is the cheapest 32\" LED on the market.  The resolution is limited to 720p which is perfectly fine for a TV of this size.The UN32C4000 is well equipped in terms of input (4 HDMI 1.3 ports, 1 USB, 1 component input, 1 optical sound input and 1 PC input).The HDMI input are located on the left side of the monitors.  IMO, the inputs are too close from the bezel so that my HDMI cables are visible from the side.  HDMI angle cables may be more suited for slim monitors like this one.Edge-lit LCDs are known for having uniformity issues but my unit displays was fine in this area.Backlight bleeding is minor and should not be an issue for most.Black level displayed by this monitor proves to be significantly better than my 2 years old Samsung LN32A450.However, watching the Dark Knight movie was a bit painful to my trained eyes.  This tv is not suited for movie watching due to lack of details in shadows.The OSD is well designed and makes the calibration a bit easier compared to the LN32A450.I really want to point out that this TV is really beautiful due its ultra slim design and the familiar Touch of Color Design.2) Advanced FeaturesCalibration was done with he help of a Enhanced Chroma 5 meter (LED compliant).  Unfortunately, the results are disappointing.a) RGB Color Balance (GreyScale)  Calibration was done by modifying the white balance adjustments (RGB-Offset and RGB-Gain).  The white point target is the usual 6500 as defined by HD Rec709.  While the 20%-100% stimulus are good, the 10% stimulus is way too blue (Color temperature (CT) of 8900!).  All DeltaE errors are below 3 and the average CT is 6685 (6450 if 10% stimulus is ignored).b) Gamut  I found out that this TV has not CMS control.  This is a big let down since the user manual clearly specifies that a custom color space is available (p.16) but it is NOT there in the OSD.  Thus, I was only able to modify the gamut by adjusting the clumsy Color setting.  Fortunately, the end result is satisfying since the delta errors are below 5 for all primaries and secondaries.c) Gamma (Target of 2.2)  Let me be clear here, the gamma curve is awful.  Gamma is stable between the 10% to 50% stimulus but drops into the abyss between 60% and 90%.  Adjusting the gamma control uniformly shifts gamma over all stimulus and does not solve the instability issue.  Nothing can be done here since there is no 10 points gamma adjustments like the UN32C6500 (more advanced) model.3) SummaryI have found out that the picture quality of the UN32C4000 is generally inferior to its 2 years old predecessor, the LN32A450.While the slim design will be missed, I will exchange this TV for the cheaper and hopefully better Samsung LN32C450.4) Calibration Settings for optimal pictureMode: StandardBacklight: 9Contrast: 82Brightness: 42Sharpness: 50Color: 46Tin: G42/R48Shadow Details: +1Gamma:+2White balance: R-Offset:30 G-Offset:25 B-Offset:23 R-Gain:17 G-Gain:35 B-Gain:18Color Tone: Warm2", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Happy with Purchase", "Author": "alternative MD", "ReviewID": "R3KUSJIDE6N4YB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Timely deliveryEasy to set upExcellent PictureNice soundPerfect size for small apartmentUnobstrusive.Good Price.Happy with Purchase after 2 months.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Gets the Job Done", "Author": "JP", "ReviewID": "R2MAB46P38KYZI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price, available features, quality, size, and power consumption this set does a great job.  Above all, this set is THIN!!!  Holy cow is it thin!  At the same time, this set is relatively light versus a CFL backlight TV.Moving on, blacks and the overall color range is pretty good on this set.  Backlight bleeding is minimal for blacks and I've fooled around with color/contrast/brightness settings to find my comfort zone.  Please, please do the same because factory settings are 99% wrong for most folks.I've done research about 1080 vs. 720 resolution and found a general rule of thumb, \"If the set is around 32\"/42\" or less then you won't see a difference between 1080 and 720.\"  So far I have to agree.  Granted I do not have a Blu-Ray player to provide an ultimate result, but with what I do have I am satisfied.  Which brought me to another conclusion when shopping for a new TV.If you buy a fancy 1080p set and hook it up to a poor signal then you wasted your money.  Meaning, if you don't provide a solid 1080 signal then you won't use the full ability of the set.  On that, just because you use HDMI does not mean you have a 1080 signal!  In my case, the cable company provides 720 resolution and if the landlord allowed it, I would go with a satellite company to find true 1080 signal.Aside from picture quality, sound quality is so so as most integrated sound systems are.  On the bright side I believe the speakers hit a moderate range of sound, but don't expect amazing bass or high tones.Last of all, I am not a huge sports fan, but when I watched the Super Bowl on this set I was impressed.  In fact, I might start watching more games now that I have this TV.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "I think it rocks!", "Author": "Ted Ingram \"Ted Ingram\"", "ReviewID": "R1G6YVEL43OUFE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just read all the other reviews.

Ledoux \"coius\"", "ReviewID": "R1AAEXPLOT2X4X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this around christmas about 2 years ago.  While the display worked fine for about 6 months, the screen started to lag (aka the sound was fine, it looked like it was doing about 1-4 Frames/sec) then the display would stop, and all the colors would fade to black.So we went it into samsung.  15 days later, it arrived. Samsung did ZERO packing and it was so loose it punched a hole through the side of the box. Fearing the worst, I opened the box (Carefully) to find the bezel around the display was smashed.  The LCD was caved in and parts of it was falling loose in the box (aka the LCD had a hole punched in).  Samsung was immediately called and we sent back to have the display and bezel replaced.4 months after this fiasco, our HDMI ports started dying one by one. The TV would shut off randomly (even on the TV Tuner which was on over the air TV).  No kids or pets in the house and only one person watching, the TV was deemed defective a 2nd time.  We called the store we bought extended warranty.  A company came out (name ommited, they were very good about it) and they replaced the logic board in our home.  3 months go by, the logic board again fails (HDMI ports, etc..) so it was replaced again.  About 2 weeks ago, issues happened.  The same company, came out and swapped in a new logic board.  2 days later similar (but slightly different) issues crop up with this board, and now possibly the power supply is on the fritz.  randomly, video would stop streaming from our Apple TV, the BluRay (a samsung BD-ROM player), the Mac Mini (I tested it) or my macbook pro or thinkpad, but audio would keep going.  The TosLink port with a pioneer receiver would randomly either stop working (not even a light) or would garble the audio. HDMI into the receiver would not do this.  Also, TV 3 seperate times would turn on on it's own (no Remote) or would turn off 2 seconds after turning on.  New batteries/different remote didn't not solve issue. I am going out to the store we bought it from (during berkshire hathoway days) and am going to invoke the lemon warranty  on this.  This will be the 4th time the logic board will be replaced in ONE year.Not happy.  My friend has a cheap-o vizio still working.My friend also has a Samsung (72\" LED) and 3 of the 4 HDMI ports don't work, and the tv randomly turns off (did so during a Husker's football game) and now lines are randomly appearing/disappearing on his screen. His was bought slightly before mine was.Not happy.  Newer samsungs may be better, but this was pure junk.  Wished I never paid the $650 I paid originally (plus I paid the $150 extended warranty. Well worth it!)  Here I was worried about backlights going out (common on cheaper CCFL TVs),  It seems everything but that has died on this!", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfied with the product", "Author": "kbrown", "ReviewID": "R1655UQU2XM9LY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very satisfied with the product, is very nice and arrived in time Excellent seller", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "A good TV", "Author": "Jimbo", "ReviewID": "RBAXVW93R0QT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV upgraded a non-HDTV.
