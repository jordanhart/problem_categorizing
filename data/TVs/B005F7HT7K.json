Lindquist \"Rick\"", "ReviewID": "R21OK550565AYD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Frankly, I only bought this particular TV because it was cheap, small and lightweight, and the picture on the display model was pretty decent. While this set might serve well for someone who has a cable TV or satellite TV connection or who plans to use it just as a video or computer monitor, it does a poor job receiving over-the-air digital TV signals that are any distance away. I have yet to pick up a single DTV signal with this set.I am using this set in eastern Maine. The public TV networ has a transmitter and antenna serving our region that's on a hill about 35 miles from here, yet I cannot receive that channel. Likewise for the strongest station out of Bangor (according to the FCC's DTV page). I can receive nothing over the air with this set. Since I don't have cable, I cannot tell if the set is broken or just extremely insensitive. I was really hoping to watch Ken Burns' \"Prohibition\" series on PBS while here.I even set the correct channel manually and tried aiming the antenna around the compass. No luck.Beyond this I found the side-mounted pushbutton controls difficult to use (you have to crane your neck around the side of the set to determine which button you're pushing), and the menu is pretty confounding.If you need a set that can receive over-the-air digital TV signals (best picture quality by far!), spend a bit more money and get a set with a better ATSC tuner.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "sansui 19\" HD LCD TV", "Name": "Sansui 19\" Hd LCD Tv Hdlcd1955w", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dce-AOs6L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005F7HT7K"}}
