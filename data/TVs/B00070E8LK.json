No problems.. Amazing extendibility. Connect to Game/DVD/PC (Yes with DVI doesn't say but it has). Amazing View angle.I love Sharp Products. Not to mention amazing crystal clear sound. I even use this TV as audio system as my neighbours don't allow me to purchase Home theatre system. This one has Virtual Dolby too.Don't get Cheapers ones.

Allen \"Sophie's Dad\"", "ReviewID": "R1GUAUZOEDTSJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a first class TV for the bedroom.  Deceptively big screen, sharp picture, good sound and simple, but extensive controls.  I looked at more expensive and higher rated LCD's, but this looked like the best value.  It turned out that I was right.  That doesn't happen very often!", "Date": "September 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "A really good buy.", "Author": "B.A.", "ReviewID": "R2R3K96V568HX4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in January, so have had it for about 9 months.  I looked at many models, and this seemed to be the best value.  The sound is phenomenal, deep stereo which surprises you from just looking at the built-in speakers.  I have enjoyed the sound in watching concert videos, such as Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Jefferson Airplane, the Who, James Taylor, etc.  The controls are complicated and not well designed.  There are too many buttons, and it is hard to find on the remote what you want it to do.  The high-def picture is excellent.  I have it hooked up to a Cablevision box.  The best picture is for baseball and football games, PBS high-def, and the Tonight Show with Leno.  For some reason, these shows stand out in their clear crisp picture and sound.  The price of this TV has dropped considerably over the past few months, so it is an even better buy.  Don't try to save a little money by buying a no-name brand.  You will enjoy spending a little more for a quality picture and sound set.", "Date": "September 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very, very nice LCD for a bedroom.", "Author": "N. Reyes \"The gizmo guy\"", "ReviewID": "R353I8HJ2W7GWJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In a nutshell, this LCD is a very nice LCD...if you have the optimum connection, which is HDMI, and you have an HDTV receiver (which is free from Comcast, my cableTV provider).  Right off the box and after connecting to regular cable to it, it doesn't bring out the optimum reception.  Actually, it looked pretty average and even looked like total crap on some channels until I got the HDTV receiver and saw what high definition TV is *supposed* to look like.  You can still connect this TV to component video and get a nice reception, but nothing beats HDMI.  Trust me, it's worth shelling out an expensive HDMI cable for this - there is a BIG difference from component video to HDMI - so I would definitely recommend that you connect it this way.  Needless to say, the reception when the connection is through HDMI is immaculate and close to perfect!", "Date": "January 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very good product for the price", "Author": "J. Moronta", "ReviewID": "R2V2YUMAEHKQ7U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with this purchase.  I'll rate based on individual attributes:-PictureIt's excellent, and looks amazing when connected to an HD receiver as long as the program is in High Definition.  Standard signals look okay, although obvioulsy not as good as on a standard tv.-SoundThe sound is very good, and I was actually surprised by the quality of the speakers.- Overall connectivity/Remote/OtherThe remote is huge, but has tiny buttons (not very good design).  The diversity of inputs is very good, although to be honest, their placement is not perfect.  Trying to connect an s-video input can be troublesome.  Connecting a game console always yields great results, and some of the games look amazing on this set.Overall, after looking at the price of comparable Sony and Samsung sets, I'm very happy with this LCD TV.", "Date": "August 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "Splendid Widescreen Flat-Panel LCD TV", "Author": "John Kwok", "ReviewID": "R2RC857U4HGOVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a relative who owns this model and am quite impressed with the image quality, even though she doesn't have it hooked up to a cable television service. The reception is superb for most of the commercial stations in the New York City area, with some of the finest image quality I have seen from a television. I've also watched movies from a DVD player connected to this television, with absolutely impressive contrast and resolution. Yes, this is an expensive Flat-Panel LCD TV, but what you get is well worth the cost.", "Date": "September 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2VGA6U397R07B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're considering an lcd, definately consider this one.  I don't watch much tv at all.  I bought this monitor to be used as a PC monitor for gaming.  If you connect this set to a high end graphics card through DVI...Wow...Just wow!  I spent months researching these  televisions, and finally decided on this one.  All that time waiting and researching paid off in spades.  World of Warcraft has never looked better!!!", "Date": "February 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "'More to See' in Sharp's Aquos 26\" LCD TV", "Author": "RnA", "ReviewID": "R2E9X4C46T8TUY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought a similar Sharp Aquos LC-26DA5U 26\" LCD TV a few weeks ago. Great picture quality, superb sound, stylish design. After a lot of research and numerous trips to stores, we narrowed our search down to Sony (picture), Samsung (price) and Sharp (middle ground). Sharp definitely gives you the best of both worlds - quality picture at a great price. One area for improvement - remote control design (reminds me of a laundry bat :-)).
