{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Can you say \"chromatic aberration\"??", "Author": "E-lcos \"elcos\"", "ReviewID": "R2XRPRDDF1BZGG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been through 3 of the HD61Z575 sets in the last 2 weeks.  They all suffer from chromatic aberration:  whenever there is a high-contrast object on the screen (e.g., white letters on a dark background, such as displayed using an on-screen guide) there is a one-pixel-wide stripe of green on one side of the object, and a one-pixel-wide stripe of magenta (reddish) on the other.  Darth Vader has a halo when moving across a light background!!!If you don't mind spending upwards of $3k on a TV, and having such flaws, this TV is for you:  the HD is truly spectacular.  However, if you are one to \"tweak\" the settings on the TV to get the best picture possible, once you see this flaw, you won't be happy with the set.  The flaw was supposedly fixed in models made after August 2004, but the 3 December 2004's that I have had in my house all had this manufacturing flaw that can't be adjusted.  Of course, I know that the picture won't be \"perfect\" on any TV set.  However, this is not seen in other technologies (JVC is LCOS-based).HD material is truly awesome on this picture, except for the flaw.  If it is something you don't notice, then I recommend this TV.  If you are a discriminating TV viewer, and are concerned about such things as black levels and true color reproduction (all technologies have plus's and minus's in these categories), then this flaw will not be something you can live with.", "Date": "February 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "lamp problems", "Author": "Teresa H.

Arnett", "ReviewID": "R1DE5VO3QVD2M7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my HD-ila brand new from Z-best electronics. I paid over 3k for it at the time. I know the downside to all DLP/LCOS tv's is the lamp burning out, however 6 years later, mine is still going strong. My tv averages at least 4 hours of use per day. I play many PS3 games on it and watch HD movies like crazy. The picture is outstanding. I want to upgrade to a 1080P tv, however this thing keeps kicking, and I honestly can't picture a tv looking better. Maybe side by side I'd see the difference, however in my home it looks flawless. I even got the swivel stand made by JVC so I can easily face the tv towards my dining room when it's time to eat.  A couple pointers for those of you with bulb issues.  -Never turn the tv off by a switch or unplugging it. Always allow it proper shutdown time so that the bulb can be cooled off by a fan.  -Keep the tv at least 2-3 feet from the wall behind it. This allows proper air flow to keep the bulb cool, and makes it less likely for a dusty build up.  -DUST!! Dont let dust sit on your screen, or on the back. This will clog up the air vents, causing the bulb to get very hot and blow.  -Don't constantly turn your tv on and off. Repeatedly doing this will also shorten the life of the tv. Just like a regular bulb!I have more than gotten my moneys worth, and would gladly buy this tv again.

Although those that have problems will likely complain quite readily.Being the second owner of my now 4yr old TV, I can say it's served me rather well this last couple of years without any problems at all.  The picture is still perfect and it is still more than capable of displaying the HD content given from any cable provider.However, because its 720P it can not display the full resolution of Blu-Ray... but that doesn't matter because unless you have superhuman vision you absolutely can not tell the difference at 10 feet away.  Honestly, I can't tell the difference at even 4' away, but like most people I don't have 100% perfect vision.  20/20 only indicates how sharp or clear your vision is at a distance.  Overall vision also includes peripheral awareness, eye coordination, depth perception, focusing ability and color vision. All things considered, the science and economics are in your favor to get a giant tv that is High Definition but not inhumanly high...and get one that has a reputation for quality and endurance.  This one has stood the test of at least 4yrs strong.Yes, TV bulbs do eventually have to be replaced, and a couple years ago there was a problem with a particular manufacturer of the bulbs for this model but that has long since been corrected.  Also, the price of new bulbs have since dropped dramatically and hopefully will continue to drop.By the given deadlines, my TV bulb is long overdue to die.<knock knock>", "Date": "June 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Larry L.
