{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very happy with the E7000", "Author": "J. mamrosh", "ReviewID": "R324UUCVN8AA1P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung E7000 a few weeks ago and am extremely happy with the picture quality and features of this TV.  I had recently purchased the Panasonic ST50 but had issues and Amazon quickly and painless exchanged and took care of for me...they are outstanding.  I am not a fanboy of either brand and with the ST50, couldn't get comfortable, even with the great reviews it gets.  I went with the E7000 over the E8000 as the 8000 had many gadgets/apps that I wouldn't use and didnt warrant the extra cost.From reading the AVS and High Def Junkies forums, I will try to give some of my opinions on common issues/thoughts etc. - Buzzing - I have no significant buzzing or humming.  All plasma's make a buzz sound from what I have read but mine does not have  anything that is bothersome to myself or that my family has commented on. I have heard of some people having issues with this but I have not.  I have seen/heard 3 sets (2 e7000 and 1 e6500) and none have had issues.- I have had no image retention/burn in. I do not watch something for 8 hours straight or game the day away however. I have played Call of Duty for a few hours - no issue. Family member left DVR paused for few hours - no issue. I did run the 4 day slides to break in the tv.  I have read that you should so I did.  Why not try to deter problems and maximize the TV?!  It's  a pain to wait but worth it.- Reflections from screen.  The glass panel does have reflections when comparing to matte finish of LCD/LED.  Thats just how it goes.  This TV definitively has easily manageable glare however.  In my den I have 2 sliding doors to the rear of the room which are directly opposite of the TV - about 20 feet away. It gets morning light. The sliders have built in blinds which I generally keep closed. If I didn't have the blinds, I would possibly consider drapes. With TV off, seems reflective IMO. Once I turn it one, picture masks the reflection well and I seldom have any issue. About 4 feet from the tv on the ceiling I have a fan and light. Same thing, when the TV is on, looks fine. To the left front of TV (TV mounted kitty corner) there is a window that I keep open and it doesnt affect anything- Picture - OUTSTANDING - sharp, crisp, clear, lots of adjustment, dark levels can be adjusted, brightness is there and it just right for me!  Blu-ray is amazing.  I enjoyed my 3 year old Sharp Aquos 52\" and Samsung LCD but this TV night and day.  The viewing angle is also much better than my Sharp and my Samsung.  Motion blur - whats that? This is so much nicer watching fast motion than my other tvs.I watch a lot of TWC high def. tv and stream Netflix.  Streaming in Smart Hub works great - very responsive and picture quality is great.  I havent tried many other apps but they are plentiful.  I also havent tried 3D yet.I would highly recommend this TV to friends and family with the caveat that it is a plasma, so there are some preparations and precautions that you should research a little on and be aware of.  They are easily found at the two forums I mentioned above.  I should also mention that after I broke in the TV, I followed some recommended settings found on CNET and then adjusted with the Disney WoW disk I bought here at Amazon.  Really helped bring out the picture with some fine tuning.The cons - well, maybe there is another plasma out there that gives you a little better darks but IMHO, that doesnt make up for the clarity and sharpness of this plasma.  Sound is pretty good in itself but I am used to hooking up to surround system.  Every TV is going to have some weaknesses to each person, so expect something - from any brand.Hope this helps in some peoples decisions - I am no videophile but have researched and educated myself somewhat in purchasing a plasma and this one in particular.Also - be sure to register at Samsung's website for an extra 3 months warranty.Amazon delivery - out of this world.

After seeing a great deal on the e7000, $1800 with a free Samsung HW-E450 Wireless AirTrack Sound Bar, I was pushed to make that my purchase.After getting the TV setup I immediately noticed the buzzing.  Some buzzing in plasmas is normal but, the buzzing of the e7000 was loud enough to be distracting when sitting 10'+ away with the volume at a medium low level, although the buzzing is significantly reduced if sitting off center (>~40 degrees) of the TV.  I did some searching online to see what might alleviate the issue and found a few suggestions such as lowering contrast, brightness, and cell light settings, but none of those things worked.  I thought I might be able to deal with the buzz and was able to watch a blu ray version of WALL-E, which looked amazing, with the sound turned up to drown it out.  After a few more days and trying a few more things I decided the buzzing was too much and called Amazon about getting a replacement, the process was quick and easy. I boxed up the e7000 and within two days they sent someone out to drop off the replacement and to take away the original.  Upon powering it up, I again immediately noticed the buzz on the replacement and it is the same if not worse than on the original.Reports I've seen online indicate some people have had to go through 4 or 5 replacements before getting one with an acceptable level of buzz.  So at this point I'm not sure if I want to try for yet another e7000 replacement or if I should go ahead and get the Panasonic GT50 which at the moment is priced lower than the e7000.A few notes about my TV setup:I have the TV sitting on its stand, so when sitting on the couch my head is aligned almost dead center with the TV.  The buzzing is less noticeable if I stand, crouch down low, or I am off to the side.  So for those of you that plan on wall mounting the TV at a height above your head the buzzing may not be an issue for you.  I've also been using the sound bar through ARC(HDMI Audio Return Channel) which sounds much better than the built in speakers, but the buzz is present with or without an external speaker connected.Some other things I tried to reduce buzzing with no success: - Unplug other items from power strip - Plug TV directly into wall outlet - Move TV further away from/closer to the wall - Tried various input sources, DVR through HDMI, PS3 through HDMI, analog cable, XBOX 360 through component, and no sources connected at allUPDATE (8/8/2012):I ended up returning the E7000 and going with the GT50.  Finally no buzzing!  I wasn't able to compare the units side by side but the pictures seem very comparable.  I will say I preferred the Samsung stand, as it swivels for the 60\" while the Panasonic does not, and menus but after a few hours of use I am satisfied with the GT50 its performance and the fact that it does not have an audible buzz at viewing distance.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "What an amazing unit", "Author": "RapStar \"aakouladjian\"", "ReviewID": "RHB65SZRWC5YS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to give this one 5 stars. I am very reserved when it comes to 5 stars. I inserted the WOW disney bluray to calibrate the TV on movie mode. It really did not need much tweeking right out of the box.Living room TV is PN59D7000 which I have used everyday for over a year now and is still working like brand new! The price of the 2012 models have dropped and improved quality so I went with the PN51E7000 for much cheaper than ALL THE MARKET. I really liked the fact that I can use my 2011 3D glasses and it came with 2 new 2012 glasses. That was the real deal breaker for me.Pros: 1) Sexy TV 2) Handles HD perfectly 3) Barely changed anything from Calibration CD 4) Much faster start-up from my 2011 modelCons: 1) struggles to play old movies that are not converted to HD, to be more clear, that is when the buzzing sound appears. It is faint but you can feel the TV does not like anything that is not HD. 2) The wires are very difficult to get to from the Wall Mount. I used the cheap Cheetah mount and TV could care less. It looks beautiful. 3) Can't think of any other cons... I really am trying too.I have to talk about buzzing. My 2011 model does not buzz unless I put some really low end standard TV, old movies in. During extreme HD content, it is whisper quiet. It is plasma and they run hotter. I stand minimum 10 feet away from both TV's.The new 2012 model did BUZZ out of the box. I turned down the lamp power from max 20 to 15 and have not heard anything since. Also, I plugged in all the HD content and it handles HD perfectly, only when I put on HBO and they playing old movies from the 90s, I do hear some struggle. It is as if the TV struggles to handle the lower quality of color.Sorry for the ADD review of 2011 and 2012 models.

I was surprised that the Amazon shipping through CEVA also included \"white glove\" setup.

He offered to remove the box and packaging, but I wanted to keep it just in case I need to return.  This service was included in the free shipping.As for the TV itself - the picture is stunning, but I'll have to play with it for a few days.Note that it does NOT have a VGA port for connecting a computer - only HDMI.  On the plus side, it does have one HDMI port that support audio return channel (ARC) to send sound from the TV apps (e.g. Pandora) back to the A/V receiver without using the digital audio output.  Also, Samsung doesn't seem to have an Amazon app for streaming video.Four stars for now, but I may upgrade to five after I've had more time to judge the picture quality.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Michael Kinane \"AUDIO/VIDEOPHILE\"", "ReviewID": "RZPNKY3P4CW2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will make this short and sweet.1) Plasma picture is gorgeous the best in its class,right out of the box.

A brief summary of those televisions:1) Samsung PN59D8000 - Excellent TV except for the intolerable buzz2) Samsung UN55D7000 - Screen uniformity, edgelighting, choppy motion at times3) LG 60PM9700 - Physically damaged4) LG 60PM9700 - Horrendous video processor, even HD Dish signals pixelated5) Samsung UN60D7000 - A bright Orange vertical band of pixels6) Samsung PN60E7000 - See #1 but without the buzzIf I knew ahead of time the grief I would go through with #3, #4 and #5 I would have stayed with #2.  In a sense #5 was a I'll settle for a Samsung LED but since this unit was defective I thought I would give a Samsung plasma another chance despite the continued complaints of loud buzzing from the 2012 models.  I don't know how fortunate I was but the E7000 isn't a buzzer (just the normal buzz inherent to plasmas).Design:I love the styling and workmanship of the high-end models from Samsung - both plasma and LED.  The lack of easily scratchable glossy black plastic is much appreciated.  I know some don't care for the chrome quad stand but it's more preferable to a monolithic slab of plastic that's a dust magnet.Sound:As far as internal TV speakers go the sound is fine but I'm utilizing a sound bar and subwoofer.Picture Performance:I'm very smitten with Samsung's video processor as it does an excellent job of providing a crisp picture. The colors look rich and natural, no motion issues and solid black levels.  STD content is as good as can be expected.  And there are the positive attributes of plasma technology such as screen uniformity and wide viewing angles.Smart TV:I only care about Netflix and VUDU and they both perform wonderfully.  You get the latest version of Netflix.  I expect great picture quality from VUDU HDX offerings but was pleasantly surprised how well some HD content from Netflix looked.The dual processors apparently improve response times as Netflix is much more responsive.  You no longer need to count on a Blu-ray player or some other media streaming device for reliable steaming services.I imagine the web browser still doesn't work nearly as well as it does on your computer but that is probably the furthest of my priorities in a television.Side note: 99% of the time any buffering issues is not with the TV.Comparison to Panasonic plasmas:The 2012 plasma offerings from Panasonic have been getting rave reviews and I'm sure they are great TVs.  But I'm willing to give up any advantages in shadow detail for a sharper picture which really comes into play with STD signals.  And though the design of Panasonics have much improved I feel they still use too much cheap plastic.This is the best TV for me.  It doesn't have the peek whites of a LED but you sacrifice too much in other areas of picture quality IMO.  The lone exception may be the Sharp Elite LED.UPDATE (6/22): This model has to be one of the best kept secrets out there as I still have the most recent review.  It has all the performance features of the higher model but without the useless interaction features.  I still think the picture is excellent, noticeably better than any of Samsung's LEDs in my opinion.

Marton", "ReviewID": "R1MM8533IJ778Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have an older Samsung 50 plasma from several years ago so I wanted to get another Samsung to replace our Panasonic 40\" LCD.  I wasn't sure if I needed all the bells and whistles of the 7000 but decided to get it anyway.  I'm glad I went up in class.  The WiFi is great and interfaces seamlessly with my Apple Airport, Apple TV, Windows 8 desktop (preview edition).  First, for the non-traditional features.  I can select a picture from my Windows desktop and it will play it on the TV.  That is awesome!  Makes sharing travel pictures and videos so much easier to view.  I also like the Netflix interface on the TV as I don't have to go to my desktop to queue up a movie or TV show.  In retrospect, I'm happy that I got a TV with all the bells and whistles as I usually just get the plain Jane models.  The 3D is something I could have probably passed on as my kids are all in college but it's nice to have for those occasions when we want to view something in 3D.  3D is great - no problems at all.  The 2D to 3D conversion is also not bad.  We got the Samsung just in time for the Summer Olympics and the TV really got to show off it's stuff.  The picture was so crisp/clear and life like - almost 3D in its self.  We have it hooked up to a Time Warner cable box via a HDMI cable.  There is some glare issues as we have a window behind us that causes reflections to appear on the TV but that has been a problem with all of our TVs in this room.  This Samsung is amazingly well built and solid.  Event he \"X\" pattern feet / stand looks sturdy and expensive.  The screen is also very thin and swivels which is convenient.  I believe the screen generates less heat than the older Samsung 50\" plasma or the Panasonic LCD.  There's no fan so it's also quiet.  The sound is pretty good and the best that I have experienced so far.  No buzzing issue like some others have noted.  Delivery was a breeze - we scheduled the day when I purchased it.  Two guys delivered it and set it up - much like the old days when you bought something from a dedicated TV store.  All in all, a great purchase!", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding TV", "Author": "D. PIKE", "ReviewID": "R3QG1R30HPZ2VF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So most important thing first, the picture quality is phenomenal, it is every bit as good as every review I have seen says. And I don't have the eye of a videophile so it is just fantastic and I have absolutely no complaints.When I first hooked up this tv I had a slight ghosting problem, 2D images would skew to the left, and menues would change the color of the picture behind it going off to the left of the screen. This greatly concerned me but as soon as I put the included ferrite core on the power cord this issues was resolved. They give you those cores for a reason, don't forget to use them!!!I have had absolutely no buzzing sound from this tv as some other reviewers have mentioned and that was my biggest worry when making this purchase. I thought maybe my ears were too old and it was just a buzz I couldn't hear, but my 9 year old cousin was over and she didn't hear any buzzing either so I'm confident that my unit has no buzzing.Apps are overwhelming. I have never used a smart tv before this one, and I found the apps to be a bit overwhelming(granted everything is extremely fast thanks to the dual core processor) and it took several days of exploring to get the hang of the smart hub, I don't think that it is quite as useful as samsung is trying to make it out to seem but I do love that you can stream 3D movies from VUDU and Cinema Now. One problem with the smart tv is the app marketplace, since this tv does not have the video camera or come with the touch remote there are many, many apps that are not usable for this tv, however they still show up in the market place and you can even install them and won't find out that you can't use them till you've already downloaded or bought them, so be very aware when making app purchases and make sure you can use them with this TV.Playback of content off of a USB stick is very smooth, there is no stuttering of video as I had on my previous samsung TV and there is no video lagging behind the audio, you can even play 3D movies off of a usb stick.Sound quality from the built in speakers is pretty good, a little bit hollow sounding but they are tv speakers so it doesn't really bother me, and when I bought the tv Amazon gave me a free speaker bar and subwoofer with it and it sounds absolutely fantastic. The virtual 3D surround sound actually works quite well and sounds fantastic.The stand is flimsy, just walking past the tv it bounces quite a lot, a problem I have never had with any other tv, and with how big this tv is I worry that the bouncing could become a little extreme, so I have made sure to ancor it.I wish there were a couple more HDMI ports, I have a lot of devices and 3 ports just isn't cutting it for me.Lastly, yes plasma screens have a greater risk of burn in, at least in the first 100 to 200 hours of use, then they have about the same risk for burn in as a LCD/LED tv, and samsung has included some great burn in protection features in the menu, including pixel orbiting to help protect against still pictures and menues, time outs, and a grey scale scrolling, where there is a vertical gradient that scrolls across the screen that can help reverse mild burn in. I have been using it when ever I am just in the room but not using the tv just to get the screen up to that 100 to 200 hour mark where it becomes less sensitive.TL; DR: Summing up, absolutely top notch picture quality, great features and great sound, but navigating and the apps take some getting used to and you need to make sure to use the ferrite cores that come with the tv. Also there is a built in user manual which is pretty helpful and you can get to it very easily since there is a Support button right on the remote. The stand is a little flimsy and makes the tv bounce a bit too much.

I'm very happy with it.I chose plasma because of the dark blacks. I watch a lot of old black and white movies and didn't want to lose that. I've been happy with this unit except sometimes the dark grays show up as complete black, so there's a small distortion there from what you'd see on a theatre screen.I also chose plasma because you can view it from any angle without it washing out.I haven't had any problems with burn-in, or problems from reflections while watching in a room during the daytime. After reading some of the other review here that was a pleasant surprise.The color and HD capabilities are spectacular.  The remote is set up logically and the screens are fairly intuitive, not a steep learning curve at all.The software links to YouTube and the Web are cumbersome but they do work. I chose this TV because it could be used with my laptop as an additional monitor. That all works seamlessly via HDMI cable, so I can watch streaming videos easily. Also Samsung doesn't support Amazon online in its app packages, but that's OK since I can stream it from my computer, works fine.The E8000 is the flagship Samsung plasma this year. It has features I had no use for, like facial recognition and some sort of enhanced remote control. The E7000 has almost all the features of the E8000 for about $250 less. The only other differences I can find is that the E8000 has something called 600Hz Subfield Motion. I'm not sure what that does. It's supposed to make fast sporting events look better but I'm been perfectly happy watching sporting events on my E7000. Also, I'm not sure whether the E7000 will support upgrades via the Samsung Evolution Kit. Apparently no upgrades will be released until 2013, I guess I'll find out then.Amazon has a great grid chart for comparing Samsung Plasmas, I relied on that in making my choice. But I ended up buying from Best Buy in order to use their Geek Squad service to hook it up to all my devices. That was worth it to me, but if you don't have numerous devices like I do, I'm sure purchasing from Amazon makes sense.UPDATE 7/31/12Commenter JB has pointed out the E7000 does have 600Hz subfield motion and the Evolution Kit. So the only differences I can find now between the E8000 and E7000 have to do with the interface. The E8000 has facial recognition, a fancy remote, an extra USB port, and provision for the Samsung wireless keyboard. None of these were really important to me, so I think the E7000 is the sweet spot in the Samsung lineup.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "PN60E7000 just what I wanted!", "Author": "Daniel Austin", "ReviewID": "R3C16GOMPTCXK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching several plasma tvs from this year and last year's models, I decided this Samsung PN60E7000 would best suit my needs.

They took it away and a quick call to Amazon resulted in a new unit shipping out. It took a week, as I'm in a rural area, but the second one arrived just yesterday (delivered by CEVA). It only took a few minutes to set up and connect my cable box.What a wonderful improvement from my old tv (a 34-inch Panasonic CRT). I have noticed no buzzing, and have tried an array of inputs (DVD player, Blu-Ray player, WDTV, cable box) and every one had a rich, stunning, and beautiful picture. I will get a calibration DVD soon to play with the settings, but I am quite pleased with the factory settings for now.I'm very happy with this tv and am glad I chose it over the plethora of others out there.

After about 2 months of obsessive researching I finally decided on the GT50 (primarily based on reviews and default settings). When I went to best buy to pick up the GT50, they had this unit right next to the GT50 in the Magnolia room. After bouncing my attention back and forth between the two for about an hour; which were giving a demo on Tron, I realized the difference was very minimal. Now I have to admit, I give the advantage to the GT50. The PQ was better(barely). But I could not justify spending $500 more on something that I really didn't even notice. And that gap will be closed even further with proper calibrations. Plus the e7000 aesthetics are nicer.I walked out of best buy with the e7000, knowing that if I was un-happy with my purchase in any way shape or form that I could return the TV and get the GT50. I was actually hoping that I would have a problem with this TV so that I could the justify spending the extra money. FORTUNATELY that is not the case. This TV is absolutley stunning. I have yet to experience any problems with this TV.The picture is gorgeous to say the least. I have not had any issues with the buzzing I've read about what-so-ever.

The sound is above average at best, but I dont see anybody wiling to buy a TV of this caliber and not spending a little extra dough on at-least a sound bar.

When it went on sale and two days before Texas started to have to pay sales tax on Amazon purchases, and about a week before I convinced my wife that I could spend $1300 on a TV, I ordered it.Did not get the white glove delivery service some people have raved about. The delivery person was resistant to opening the box and refused to remove the product from the box for inspection. No problem, the TV was fine. And honestly, I did not have the location prepared for it anyway.Now, one of my concerns with my old TV was that so much stuff now days seems to be filmed in dark settings. And all I see are black screens with shadows moving around. Can not say that this new TV has solved that. The color does pop, but dark scenes are still pitch black with no way of know what is going on as far as I can see.I plan on giving the TV some time to settle in and my bank account to recover, then will see about getting a calibration tech out here to adjust the TV.Only disappointment was the sound from the TV. Please, it was very disappointing for a $1300 TV.But, wait, two days after I ordered the TV, Best Buy runs a special: buy one of these TVs and get a sound bar and sub woofer for free. So, I call Amazon customer service. The sound bar arrived four days later and is now hooked up. Totally happy.Now the best part for me. We have a lot of VCR tapes (those things that look like overgrown music tapes.... oh.. forget it. that old technology stuff like punch cards) anyway, we are cheap and have put together a large collection of VCR tapes for the kids to watch from garage sales. I was concerned that non of them would play on this newfangled TV. Not to worry. Hooked up ten year old VCR/DVD player to AV input and off an running.

The 52 was a fine TV with a great picture, but when I saw my brother's 64 inch Plasma the increase in contrast, shadow detail, and DARK blacks was an eye opener.  This unit is the new 2012 E 7000 series, installation and setup were simple and straight forward.  The built in WIFI works like a charm.  The picture quality from a quality HD source is awesome, with the depth of field that LCD can't match IMO.  You will need net access with at least 4-5 Mbps to stream HD.One note on installation, if you route your digital inputs through a receiver, be sure to adjust the picture settings at the receiver level.  I maxed these adjustments and used the TV controls to adjust the PQ.  I have no noises or screen issues that some folks had with previous Samsung plasma sets.If you get this with a price guarantee be sure to add it back to you cart and save for later.

I was coming off a 4 year old Sony Bravia LCD. The first thing I noticed was the visual difference between LCD and plasma. While the LCD is much brighter and crisper, the picture on the plasma is much more pleasing. It took me a day to appreciate the image quality, so give it a chance. I used the CNET calibration but I felt the picture was a little dark and dull so I increased brightness and color.Pros: Picture is beautiful and much more natural...3D works well though I probably won't use it much...apps work fine though the internet without a keyboard is useless...Amazon delivery through Pilot was perfect.Con: The only issue I have with this great TV is the highly reflective screen. With my old Sony, you could see there was a window in the kitchen behind the TV, but now you can see everything going on in the neighbor's yard.(I can even read the clock on the wall) If you have any kind of windows behind you it may be a deal breaker. I may have to try a Panasonic because the screen is supposed to be less reflective.I love the picture more every day. I was also having some HDMI handshake issues between my old Sony and Pioneer receiver but this new Samsung eliminated this.Also...no buzzing issues at all. I did put on a hockey game the other night and saw pops but I don't watch hockey and I had the brightness higher.You won't go wrong with this TV if you want a great picture.

Color, motion, and contrast are excellent. I really want to keep it, but buzzing is just too loud. I sat 14 ft away right at the dead center from TV, and can hear it. It is very annoying when watching movie. My dilemma is whether I should try another E7000 and hope to get a non-buzzer next time or go with Panasonic ST/GT50. Some reviewers posted they have to try until their 3rd, 4th to get a non-buzz one. I don't think I can go through all that. I know lots of people love Panny plasma ST/GT/VT. But for some reasons, whenever I was in BB Magnolia and watched PANNY side by side with SAMMY E7000/8000. I like Samsung pic better. Its black may not be as inky, but pic is more crisp, and its color looks more vibrant, not as dull as PANNY.====================UPDATE 10/23/2012,====================I gave a try on Panny ST50. Eventually, I came back to E7000 again. Here is the reasons. As I stated earlier on the post, Panny is so supreme on black level aspect and saturation color. E7000 though has a better/sharper image especially face clarity on both SD and HD cable and blu-ray.When comparing side by side, ST50 has more image pops due to its color depth, but its facial image is a little soft. Due to its color, I felt like I would go for ST50. But now when I started to watch E7000 for a while without side by side comparison, I felt that my eye got used to it, and now its color and black looks second to none. My point is that without comparing side by side, black and contrast on E7000 looks awesome. Now adding image clarity on the top of it, I just couldn't deny E7000. In my opinion, E7000 has some characteristics of LCD/LED in terms of sharpness/clarity, but still maintain plasma benefits of deep black, view angle, and uniformity. It has the best marriage between two technologies that I am looking for.About the buzzing, I mounted TV just a little bit higher 7 inches above, then the directional buzz went over my head and I heard nothing now. Here is conclusion about buzzing. It is there for real. This E7000 is my second set. It is a directional buzzing on the center eye level of TV. If you can avoid that by mounting your TV a bit higher, that should resolve it. Once I mounted it higher, it is virtually dead silence.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture quality, unfortunate buzzing", "Author": "RealCasually", "ReviewID": "RDUTR1YXLE1MB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will continue to update this review as I get a replacement unit.The picture quality on the panel is great--deep blacks, vibrant colors, and smooth motion.

I settled on this TV when it went on sale for Black Friday this year. The TV arrived as scheduled and the gentleman who delivered it was very friendly and helpful. I helped him unload and set up the TV in the interest of time. The start up menu where you first configure the TV is very simple and user friendly, took maybe 5 minutes in total, and then it was ready to go. I then adjusted the settings which was also easy, it took longer but only because there are such a variety of settings.Once the TV was all set up I started it up...the picture on this television in phenomenal. I was absolutely blown away by how crisp and clear the images were. HD looks so much better on this TV than my old one. One of my favorite features about this TV is the 2d to 3d conversion that it is able to do. While its not the se screen popping images you get at the theater, there is depth to the image and the clarity is unreal. I don't use it for SD channels because there isn't really a point, but for HD and blu ray movies I hardly don't have it on. I also use if for Xbox games, crysis 2 is a 3d game, I already played through it once on my old tv, but then I put it in again to try out the 3d, it is spectacular, a completely different gaming experience.The one complaint I have right now is that whenever I try to watch Planet Earth on blu ray with the 2d to 3d conversion on it triggers a glitch in the TV. Not only will it not covert Planet Earth to 3d but for everything after trying that the 3d won't work either. The only solution that the samsung tech and I came up with was to do a system reset. Which meant going through all the settings again just like when I originally got the TV. That solved the problem but its 15 minutes I don't want to have to keep using for this over an over again.Overall this TV is great and I wouldn't trade it for another.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so good !", "Author": "durds", "ReviewID": "R11QNFLCXB4TNI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased the tv on cyber monday for a great price. I did ALOT of research, pretty much read every review/comparison cnet and avforums had to offer and wounded up purchasing the e7000 over the panny GT/ST50 and the sammy e8000. So far i am not regretting my decision. The TV is replacing a 2009 samsung 42\" plasma and although that one is great, the e7000 is WAY better in terms of picture quality. IT is also MUCH thinner and weighs a little less! I am a cable cutter so dont have HD cable (only PS3 and Apple TV), but Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Call of Duty Black ops 2 all look amazing. I ordered the batman trilogy on blue ray and when i recieve that (DEC 4th) i will update my review as that should really give the TV a run for its money.The samsung smart suite is great! It is the only one to currently offer HBOGO (although it isnt yet supported by XFINITY)and mine does now have amazon instant, contrary to what others said. It also has the usual Netflix, Hulu plus, vudu etc... Web browser is not bad either, not too slow and supports flash which is great, but is annoying to use with the tv remote. Also updates take place in the background and you can continue to watch your tv while their downloading.The 3D also looks amazing! I didnt care much about the feature but after trying it out with the built in 3D app samsung has on the smart suite, i was blown away by how good it looks and ordered HUGO in blueray 3D to try it out further.I have only had the TV for a few days but i did finally notice the Buzzing noise tonight. I muted the tv and could hear it but sitting 8 feet away, and with the sound unmuted, i did not notice anything. Hopefully it does not get louder and become a problem.Internal speakers sound pretty good although i already had a nice soundbar that i hooked up to it.I highly recommend calibrating your TV with the setting recommended by cnet as it made the picture 100x better after doing so. It may vary a little depending on the lighting in your room but besides paying a few hundred dollars to have a pro come do it, you cant beat it. (be sure to use the movie setting)Overall i am very pleased with the purchase. The old sammy 42\" made a welcome addition to the bedroom, and for under 1k i now have one of the best pictures available on a television, second only to the legendary \"elite\" which cost thousands more and maybe too the panny vt-50 which is also in a different price class.Lastly if youre between this and the e8000 like i was, i went with the e7000 not only because i thought i wouldnt use the extra features (mainly voice and video control) but also i read too many complaints of users having problems with those features. If im not going to use the camera at all i sure dont want it turning of the tv when someone walks by... Thus i decided to save the money as everything else in terms of the panel, and the picture quality is exactly the same.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "better then expected.", "Author": "Joseph M.

Sarro", "ReviewID": "R3MA9GUFQ00NOJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying this is a gorgeous TV, and it is feature packed to boot. However, Samsung manages to muck it up a bit by refusing to provide even basic information about their updates, and removing features.I ordered this TV with scheduled delivery, and it showed up in perfect condition. Not a single dead pixel, which is rare! Picture quality is excellent, although the brightness is a hair on the low side for a plasma. This is a known issue with this tv though.The TV was supposed to serve as the window into a home theater PC (HTPC), and initially that worked FLAWLESSLY. Picture quality was great for an HDMI to HDMI connection from a mac mini. The 3d picture is stunning! I put in my customized color configurations after calibrating, and it was truly a great experience. The best part? Everything \"just worked.\"For the rest of this to make sense, the TV handles inputs by \"setting a name\" for each input. The name is basically the category of device best matching the source. My HTPC was set as a \"PC,\" xbox360 was set as \"Game,\" cable set top box was set as \"Cable STB,\" and so on. Based on the setting you choose, the TV attempts to apply some settings that should match the device. Initially, this all worked with no issue. I calibrated the PC input for movie color settings, and tweaked it to have perfect color for our room, and everything was good to go.And then Samsung started pushing out firmware updates.First, they do not post release notes for their firmware updates. When they do, they either copy and paste prior release notes, or simply say, \"increased functionality for viewing experience.\" That tells me nothing. I'm an engineer, and I find it infuriating that I can't know what they've changed. Asking their support folks for the release notes is like pulling teeth. This also means that when they decide to push down an upgrade, you have no idea what is contained inside of it. Since it is a smart TV, it is always online, so it will grab updates periodically - automatically.The latest firmware has made it that any device defined as a PC, when connected, you only have two \"picture modes\". \"Entertain\" (basically torch mode) and \"Standard\" (the energy star mode). None of the other settings reflected in their manual are available, including movie, which is the whole purpose for having this TV. All of the other picture modes, like \"dynamic,\" \"movie,\" \"relaxed\" have disappeared. And with them, all of my work calibrating the TV to match my room. Instead, can only change 4 different color settings - I cannot even modify tint or color saturation. The \"entertain\" and \"standard\" settings simply have these options \"greyed out\" so you can't touch them. I have CRT monitors from 20 years ago which let me adjust these basic settings.Also with the newer firmware, anything defined as a PC cannot have its aspect ratio changed from 16:9, which means if I watch video which is in 4:3, I end up with massive black bars on either side of the picture. I can't adjust it to fit. This wouldn't be a huge deal except I can't switch the color settings, so after 2 hours watching 4:3 video I end up with the black bar images retained on the screen. If this is repeated enough, I'll eventually get burn-in. Tech support's response? \"Choose one of the zoom in modes.\" When I mention that their latest firmware got rid of those options when a device is configured as a PC? \"PC's have access to a special mode called entertainment.\" Non sequitur. Idiotic non sequitur.To get back any of these settings, I have to change my PC to something else, like \"AV Receiver.\" But then, there are issues with overscan and underscan, which leaves a few columns of pixels unlit, which is a recipe for eventual burn-in. Further, it creates issues with the HDMI handshake that takes place because instead of sending out an actual 1920x1080 image, the PC is sending out a 1080p signal which the TV then has to scale. That means my text quality on the screen becomes absolutely terrible.Oh, and you can't downgrade back to the older firmware. So they'll send out a firmware which will break the features for which you bought the TV, without any release notes, and then tell you \"sorry we can't roll it back.\"So, my advice if you want to use this with a HTPC, be prepared to fiddle with the TV to get it usable, and expect all of your hard work to get blown out of the water when samsung decides to push down an opaque update that their tech support people can't explain to you.The worst part is, this TV would have gotten 5 stars about 2 weeks ago, now I feel so frustrated after dealing with their tech support that I feel it is incredibly generous to give 3 stars.

After trying 2 LED LCD TVs (a Panasonic E50 and a Samsung 6500 Series) which each had their own issues (see reviews here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W75OCFQKRAL9/ref=cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie=UTF8&sort;_by=MostRecentReview) I had a friend convince me to try a plasma.With the plasma I was worried about brightness and burn in but thought I couldn't do worse than the others, so I ordered it. As always, ordering was smooth, and inside delivery was arrainged at no charge for a prime member. It arrived on the day specified and the gentleman from Ceva (Bob) couldn't have been more helpful setting it up.Once I turned it on, it connected autmatically to the internet and it updated. I allowed it to scan my cable for existing channels which took some time and then I hooked up my BluRay to watch a movie (How To Train Your Dragon). I calibrated the HDMI input I was on to the values here: [...] and I was stunned at the clarity. I saw defination in the characters that I have never seen even on my 2 year old Samsung LED LCD 6500 series, which has an incredible picture.Movies are incredible, as I have watched Die Hard, Inception and How To Train Your Dragon on BluRay. Network TV looks great, especially sports. I have seen no artifacts or anything when watching basketball, just smooth motion with amazing clarity. I don't believe that my Xbox games have ever looked so good. I do know that the colored jewel notes in Rock Band (my favorite game) have never been so clear. When playing on game mode, Rock Band (which has a calibration function) was at 11ms audio lag and 50ms video lag. Significanly lower than the other 2 tvs I tried. I believe I am a plasma convert.The only drawback is that you have to control the light coming in the room. It does not have to be dark but you should try to make sure the light from windows is not shining directly on the screen. The screen does a good job with ambient room lighting but not with outside (sun) lighting. I believe it is plenty bright for most rooms.

I looked at various models in numerous stores and have always been impressed by this higher-end plasma. I chose this over the e8000 version, simply because the added bells and whistles reviewed widely as rather worthless. Once the annual CES show happened in Vegas, I watched the prices closely and sure enough, it dropped by ~$400....and I immediately ordered this.Setup was a breeze. There was a firmware update available as soon as the set was connected to my LAN. I should point out that the version number available via online update was newer than what was posted on Samsung's support site. Main update took only about 3-4 mins, but there were a number of updates it later asked to perform...which lent no info as to what they were. It was likely updates to the various apps it automatically installs once you launch Smart Hub for the first time.A few review sites suggest Movie Mode as the best picture setting, and I'd have to strongly agree...it looks great. An interesting thing I noticed was that you have to select your picture mode based on the various inputs you can use, independently of each other. So Movie Mode has to be enabled for HDMI-1, and the antenna input separately, as an example.3D performance of ordinary content is what I would call \"OK\"...but still better than nothing, and probly as good as any other set can do in that manner. I have yet to view a true 3D movie, but the demo in the store was very nice. The included glasses link up very very easily. I would say an annoying thing about the glasses is the light that enters around the sides and bottom. But in a completely dark room its not an issue.A very big bonus I was not aware of, is 5.1 surround from Netflix streaming, using the built-in app. I didn't get that via Windows Media Center on my HTPC.The optical audio output is excellent feature for those who still have an old reciever without HDMI switching. It also makes for a nicely unified audio setup for the various viewing I do...which is some from the HTPC, and some from the TV itself.All in all, its a great set and I'm very happy with it.

After weeks of pouring over reviews for picture quality, refresh rates, 3D quality, etc. I finally decided on this TV. I had considered the Panasonic Viera series but after doing some instore comparisons of the (2) sets I opted to stick with Samsung once again.The picture quality is magnificent! The 3D quality of the picture is quite possibly the best I have seen from any set to date. I tested the picture with Hugo, Avatar, The Avengers and Titanic. Every movie looked fantastic with almost zero issues in sight. The accompanying glasses (blue-tooth) worked liked a charm and synced to the set in less than 5 seconds. With the additional pairs I purchased, my family and I were watching 3D in under 10 seconds. The instant 3D with any source via the conversion is also amazing. You can watch anything in 3D. While these conversions are not perfect since their source material is 2D, it was cool seeing 2D broadcasted things in 3D.The set has a bevy of viewing options to tweak and adjust so you can get this set to look exactly how you want it to. The initial set up was painless and quick as well. I dove into nearly every option to see the affects of each adjustment and with the aid of a set up blu-ray disc, I had an optimal picture quickly.Running videogames on my home TV has never looked better. My Wii U, PS3 and Xbox 360 look great and the colors of each just pop on the set perfectly. The high refresh rate from this plasma set has each frame looking amazing, never missing a beat.Not a single issue with the set to date. I will update this review next year after I have had a chance to see how the set holds up over time.

I have been looking at the Panasonic UT and ST series plasmas, and the 7000 series falls right in there for comparison to the Panasonic ST series.  Overall I am very pleased with the purchase!  The picture quality is great, and very close to the Panasonic's I was looking at buying.  Side by side, you can see little difference in the picture between to two.  I was able to compare the more expensive Panasonic GT series next to this 7000 series, and the Samsung did have slightly more 'crispness' in the picture and colors (could have been the settings obviously), and the Panasonic had a bit darker blacks (especially the letterboxing/mattes/black bars above and below the video!!).Another item worth mentioning is the noise difference.  Since All plasmas generate noise due to the nature of their operation, IMO it's worth knowing the differences, if any.  I could hear (close to the screen in a room with other ambient noise) slight buzzing from both screens of course, but with the Samsung, it seems to be more noticeable than with the Panasonic.  On the Samsung in my room, with a movie playing at low volume and sitting ~5-10 feet away from the screen (this is a 60\" screen after all, so no one will be sitting any closer), I cannot hear the buzz.  WIth no content playing, and a completely silent (middle of the night, not a creature stirring), I can hear the buzz a little bit.  Again, this is in my center seating position, about 8 feet away.  It's not a bother due to the noise not being heard during any content playing (and I can hear a phone vibrate from across an office).  Also, it's Much less than any DLP TV noise (I previously owned DLP projection TVs, and the noise their fans made could be heard over the quiet parts of a movie).In my theater room you are presented with a great picture right out of the box (using the Movie preset).  I plan to calibrate the screen later, but for now, it looks great for what the family is watching.The sound from the speakers is decent, and sound ok for normal viewing, and the sound presets help out a lot with this.  Much better than the speakers in my LG LED TV.  I normally use the theatre sound system though, so the internal speaker will probably never be used.The SmartTV features are, ...ok.  I use an AppleTV or a Mac Mini for all the \"smart\" content I need, so I doubt I'll use the features at all.  They work, but I couldn't tell you how well.  Also, they are not as quick to load as something on the AppleTV.And then 3D, this was a feature I didn't care about getting, but since it has it I had to try it out.  The glasses are ok, they are fairly lightweight, but I notice glare in the sides of the lenses from any ambient lighting.  The 3D picture from the TV looks great, as good as any 3D I've seen in stores, etc.  Being active 3D, and using the active glasses with shutters, I feel that I could barely tolerate watching one movie in 3D.  I guess other people can deal with that better, but my eyes and head don't like it.  It is impressive to watch parts of a good movie in 3D though!Other small items, the stand, it looks ok I guess, it has a larger footprint than some others, yet it still feels a bit wobbly.  I plan to mount the TV on the wall anyway, as I would suggest anyone to do if the space is available.  The remote is ok, it's backlit, easy to find buttons, etc.  I'm still trying to figure out if I can use it to control more devices, but no luck on that yet (I don't have a cable box, and that seems to be the only thing it can control natively).Again, overall I am very pleased with the Samsung PN60E7000, and if you get it for the right price, it's a Very Good deal!", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything Advertised", "Author": "D.

Have been using it daily for a week now and I am very impressed.This panel replaced an aging 42\" Panasonic 720p plasma panel.Observations:1: It is in a somewhat bright room with large windows. During the day the panel is easy to see. It does have some reflections but we put the blinds down and that helps. Not as bad as some have written. Set the Picture mode to Movie and it will be plenty bright in a lit room. At night, obviously no issues, it is very bright and clear.2: The buzzing. Yes it is there. But I have to put my ear to within 6 inches of the center front of the panel to hear it. My previous Panasonic also had a buzzing but was only audible from the back of the panel. With the Samsung if I am any further than 6 inches from the panel, with the sound off, I can not hear the buzz. I may be lucky, but it is not an issue with my panel.3: I followed the setup instructions from Cnet's review of the panel (see: [...]) and the picture quality blows me away. My sources are Verizon FIOS TV, an Apple TV (Third Gen), and a PS3. All over HDMI. 1080p Content is sharp, clear and black levels are fantastic. They blow away my previous Panasonic. Shadow details are very good. I checked out Prometheus (1080p) as well as the later Harry Potter (1080p) movies which are all very dark and the black level performance was much better than I was expecting.The panel is quite light for it's size and is easy to move around. I like the fact that the base swivels.The remote is fine as remotes go and the menu system is easy to use and follow.I have not used any of the Smart TV features, I am not really interested in them.I can seriously recommend this TV, especially for the price.

And, to top it all off, a few days later, the price dropped (as I thought it might for Black Friday) and, the Price Protection got me a $400 refund without any hassles!!I wanted a Plasma TV because of the unlimited viewing angle and more 'natural' look, especially for flesh-tones. I was not disappointed!! It took a little work to fine tune the color (and I found out too, if you lose power, you also lose all the settings, ugh....), but once dialed in, the picture is awesome. The overall picture, as most have written before, is not as bright as LED, but, since my living room is fairly dark, it looks great. Flesh-tones look very natural and not as contrasty as I've seen on the LEDs although blacks may not be quite as deep on this plasma as some LEDs, overall, I think the picture quality is outstanding.Surprisingly, even though I bought a soundbar too, the speakers in the TV were not as bad as I expected. So, I set up the soundbar/sub-woofer to fire from behind my seating area, providing an almost surround sound environment, that ended up sounding pretty good.Overall, a great buy for under $1,000 (and no sales tax or shipping either) and a very pleasant shopping experience.

Here are my talking points.-I don't have the buzzing problem some have.-The picture is among the best I've seen.  a. Black levels are very true  b. Flesh tones are spot on  c. Was worried about brightness(vs.LED) but don't worry, whites get super bright.  d. Didn't like out of box settings - still trying to get perfect settings.-The biggest problem for me is plasma flicker. Only a few people can see it and I didn't know much about it before I purchased this TV. It can cause headaches and is downright annoying. Read up on it and go to a retail store and make sure you can't see it before buying. Best way to test yourself is to stand in front of a plasma and look off to the side of the TV. Use your peripheral vision to look at the TV. If you see a mild strobe effect, you are one of the unlucky ones like me. I was about to return the TV when I figured out it doesn't do it when you have 3D bluray running. From what I understand, there isn't much out there that really pushes anything over 60hz to your TV except 3D blurays which is 120hz, so no flicker? I'm no expert but this is what I've determined with using the googles and experimenting with different signals. Using an antenna is the worst so far. I have decided to keep the TV because movies look so good on it. As for the flicker with some signals, I have found turning down the cell lights(backlight) and brightness almost completely remove it and the picture still looks good.-Form factor is great, thin, clean and simple. I don't mind the glass glare of the plasmas being that it is in a darker room.-Stand is a bit bigger than I thought it would be. Causes the TV to stand quite a ways off the wall(6-8in). Kind of defeats the thinness of the TV. I mounted it using the Cheetah Mount APTMM2B, a great inexpensive mount.

I wanted a TV with \"apps\" so I could stop using my xbox to access things like netflix.  some thoughts after three weeks:pros:-the interface is user friendly and it was fairly easy to set up the allshare feature with my pc.  I have used it to view movies via a thumb drive (before I realized I could use allshare:) ) and it worked well.- it includes 2 x 3d glasses.  very nice.  I havent used it to watch anything serious in HD besides the \"intro app\" but it was impressive- its slim and sleek with a thin bezel- evolution kit compatible.  tv can be upgrade down the road.  it has yet to be seen if the kit will work well/worth the money for the kit, but its a little piece of mind for longevitycons:- inputs/outputs.  there is only one composite/component input.  I didnt even think to look before I bought it(my old TV had 3 component and 3 composite - i thought this would have the same/more).  This is only an issue switching between my xbox/wii, which is easily done, but i was still surprised.  yes, I can purchase a hdmi cable for the xbox or buy an A/B switch but I didn't think I would need to.There is also only 1 optical audio output.  Again, I didn't look before hand, but I would have thought it would have had a component/RCA audio out.  I picked up an optical cable to run to my home receiver which does work without issue.- there is NO cable management at all in the back of the tv. Really??  SMH.  I use the TV on its  stand (Im in a rental and not about to cut holes into the wall).  I got creative with some twist ties through the wire mesh vents in the back and some velcro strips, but I would at least expect a channel/clip at the bottom of the TV at the center for cabling.- the refresh rate is lackluster.  This is my first plasma.  I have always owned rear projection or LCD tv's in the past, and sports is the same; slight pixelization on fast moving objects in HD (noticed watching NBA playoffs).  Possibly its my HD receiver? I honestly expected to be \"WOW-ed\" since this is one of the strengths of a plasma.  I wasn't.- the wireless doesnt seem to keep up with HD content.  it was constantly buffering.  Im using a linksys e2500 Linksys E2500 Advanced Simultaneous Dual-Band Wireless-N Router, and the TV is 30 feet away (getting 10Mbps down from ISP).  my laptop never has an issue.  alternatively, my parents recently purchased a 70\" LCD (I think it was toshiba) and I was showing them netflix; we watched a few shows in HD connected to a 5 year old wireless N router.  no issues.  I ran an ethernet cable to my TV , and now its fine.  just another nuisance I ran into which I didn't expect to have happen.I have not experienced any of the buzzing others have noted even watching non-hd content with the lamp/brightness all the way up.All in all at the end of the day, after some unexpected hurdles, it is a nice TV. And purchasing it with fast free shipping through amazon with prime is truly amazing.  Was it worth the money to replace my 4-5 year old LCD?  Knowing what I know now, probably not.

I also got a Disney WOW: World of Wonder - Blu-ray Disc and went through all the menus, but to be honest, the tv was very close to perfectly calibrated right out of the box!The delivery process was kind of a pain.  When I purchased it, amazon was offering a soundbar with it, so I took advantage of the offer and ordered both.  The product page said \"Want it Friday, February 1? Order within 15 hrs 18 mins, and choose Standard Delivery: Carrier will contact you for scheduling an appointment at checkout.\"  I added the tv and soundbar, proceeded to checkout, but did not get that option.  All I had was the free super saver shipping, so I selected that, and submitted my order.When I checked the status of my order, the delivery date was the Monday following the superbowl, not the Friday before it.I was bummed, but later in the week I saw that the delivery date had been updated to be Friday, so I thought everything was working out!  I was then emailed by the delivery company (Pilot) on Thursday with a link to schedule a delivery, but when I visited that link, the earliest delivery date was Monday, so it was back to arriving post-superbowl.I sent the delivery company an email and explained the situation, that I had ordered it for the superbowl and if it was going to arrive after the superbowl, I'd rather just return it and wait for newer models.  Much to their credit, they responded to me that same night, and told me that they would talk with dispatch and see if they could deliver it.I got a call the next morning telling me it would be delivered that afternoon!When the delivery guy showed up, I realized I misunderstood what \"unpack\" means - I thought that meant the delivery guy would take the tv out of the box and attach the stand to it.  Nope.  Apparently it just means take it out of the box.  I don't know if they just take it out and lean it against a wall or what, because my delivery guy was nice enough to help me attach the stand, so kudos to Pilot - they took a potentially terrible situation and made it all better.Back to the tv itself - it's beautiful, I have it against a wall with a low ceiling fan/light in front of it and there's no glare, my only disappointment with it is that less than a month after getting it, the Anynet+ stopped working.This feature is important to me because the soundbar I got with it is a Samsung HW-E551, which also supports Anynet+, so I've got the tv and soundbar connected via their respective ARC HDMI ports using an AmazonBasics HDMI cable, which supports ARC, that way I can have the audio from the tv coming out of the soundbar, and plug additional components into the soundbar (it has 2 HDMI inputs, in addition to the ARC port).  It worked great for 3 weeks, and then just like that, it stopped.The soundbar still works with its own HDMI inputs, streaming the video to the tv, but when it comes to playing audio from the TV's inputs (cable box, gaming system) through the soundbar, it doesn't work.I contacted Samsung to schedule a repair, so hopefully they can fix it and it'll stay fixed for a long time, because it really is a good tv other than the Anynet+ failing.Update: a week after Anynet+ stopped working, I saw a message on my screen telling me it was deleting amazon, netflix, hulu, and youtube apps.  Now they're gone from my smart hub, and I can't figure out how to get them back (clicking on Samsung Apps does nothing).  In addition, despite being connected to my router with an ethernet cable and having an IP address, it keeps telling me it's not connected to the network.  This TV's turning out to be a lot of trouble.Update 2: The apps came back on their own, I found lots of other people who had this problem.  As for the HDMI-ARC, the Samsung service tech came out and replaced the main board of the tv, and it still didn't work, so he concluded it was the soundbar I got with the tv (samsung HW-E551).  I'll be sending that one in for repairs (which samsung expected me to pay for).Update 3: I sent the soundbar to their service center in NJ and they said nothing was wrong with it, it must be the tv.  So the TV tech blames the soundbar, the soundbar tech blames the TV, and I'm still stuck with a tv that won't work as designed.  I've tried talking to Samsung customer service on twitter and live chat, and they've been clueless.  It's not the soundbar, it's not the HDMI cables (I've tried 3 different cables from 2 manufacturers, all brand new), and now Samsung wants me to go buy an optical cable and see if that works (can't their service tech bring a cable to test it out?  Apparently not).  When I bought this, I didn't realize I'd have to spend more money just to get them to provide warranty support.Samsung's customer service reps are giving me the run-around, and odds are they will continue to do so for the remainder of my warranty (one of them even hung up on me the other night when I tried calling them).

Just a little tweaking with the brightness for my personal taste.  That was it.I'd read reviews on this model before purchasing and became well aware that the installed apps were not very good but the current model is much better.  Well, I don't do apps so this isn't a problem for me at all, especially in saving $1000 over the current PN64F8500 model (the PN64F8500 is an amazing TV and is what got my eye on HDTV Plasma in the first place).Setup was rather easy and only took a few minutes before I could auto-scan the DTV & HDTV channels (I am using cable without a box).Internal speaker quality is a whole other thing.  I never thought anything could sound so bad.  It is similar to listening to sound through a laptop.  What really bothers me is that Samsung has decided to eliminate all analog audio output connectors.  I truly can't understand why.  Sound bars sound horrible unless you spend hundreds of dollars, and even then a good Dolby Pro-logic analog reciever would run circles around any sound bar.  There is a Digital Optical audio output port which I ended up using after purchasing a Optical to Analog adaptor.  Now the sound sounds great through my somewhat older $6,000 stereo system.The apps that come with this set do work but very slow and clunky in the way they work.  The integrated internet browser is a joke.  It is so clunky to get around that it just plain isn't worth the frustration.  It took me 10 minutes just to key in google.com.I just use my Blueray player's apps and Ruku box and everything is fine.I recommend this HDTV highly.  If you want one you'd better hurry.

There is an app you can download to you Android phone that will help a little with the typing and can be used as a remote.

The Samsung E7000 quality is worth the typical sales price in my opinion, but I bought it despite my misgivings about some of Samsungs past criminal activity (LCD price fixing) hoping it would beat the Panasonic, but I'd place it on par based on the limited viewing of the PanasonicThe good:- Superb image quality. Among the best I've seen for clarity, accurate tones, deep blacks, and retention of both highlight and shadow detail. To my only modestly-trained eye, as I said, on par with the Panasonic, but it is clearly better than most other TV's I've seen, which frequently have fuzzy edges, oversaturated colors, and loss of blacks and highlight details.Whatever criticisms I state below, don't lose sight of the fact that TV's are primarily about delivering you an image. Image quality is critical. That makes this set a keeper despite its flaws.- Came well adjusted. I don't know if I got lucky, or if Samsung has started pre-calibrating their sets for typical conditions from the factory, but I haven't even bothered adjusting it yet except to increase the cell light brightness level, which contrary to the norm was set too low instead of too high.- Reasonable sound. There's only so much to expect for sounds from a thin TV. It's acceptably clear, although I usually have to keep it at above 50% volume, but that doesn't appear to be causing any damage. For some reason, DVD's play slightly louder than Netflix content.- Despite a glossy screen that I had concerns about, glare is not an issue (I have no direct sunlight in my room, but do have several windows).- It looks good.The bad. None of these bump the TV down below a 4 star (3 if I were in a more critical mood...4 is pretty good in my book), but Samsung definitely could do better:- It's just as dumb as every other \"smart\" TV. This is my only significant complaint, and I break it out into several bullet.- Apps and Samsung Smart Hub are relatively slow to load, and not at all smooth to use. Sometimes, I press a remote button, see the LED indicator on the front of the TV confirm the signal was received, and nothing happens. More commonly, it varies between responding instantly to a button press, or waiting several seconds, so then I press it again only to have to then back up. This is frustrating. It's like word processing on a 1983-vintage Apple IIe (been there, done that, thought the laggy experience was over).- The web browser is a joke. Unlike with most apps, where pushing an arrow key when the on-screen keyboard is displayed moves between letters on the keyboard, in the web browser, it moves the cursor a few pixels. Combined with that lag, typing in a single URL takes several minutes. After watching me deal with it for a bit, my wife walked to the kitchen, brought back the laptop, waited for it to start up, loaded its browser, and STILL beat me to the page I was trying to reach.- Even neglecting the necessarily more restricted interface, it's \"smart\" capabilities pale in comparison to a $200 tablet. Since the premium over a base model plasma is less than an entire tablet, you'd think some TV manufacturer could come close, but none do, so I can't really hold this against Samsung.- Not really any peripheral support. Would a generic wireless USB keyboard and mouse driver hurt anyone? Apparently the geniuses who figured out they can charge $99 for an undersized Samsung branded keyboard think it would.- DLNA requires you to install a bit of server software on your computer if you want to browse shared media. Why the well-established, very reliable, and very easy to use SMB protocol couldn't be used is beyond me. Not only does this mean more unnecessary software, but it also means users of networked attached storage (ethernet hard drives) need to make sure they get one that is DLNA compatible.- Some features in the Smart TV setup are not well explained.- Getting past the Smart TV-related complaints, the stand is a bit wobbly. Not really confidence inspiring. I also foresee the funny shape making it harder to perch a center channel speaker in front of the TV than with a rectangular stand.- No cable management. Cables just dangle from their ports. I'm going to put some adhesive ziptie anchors on it to route everything neatly out of sight behind the stand.- Slight buzz. Same thing others reported. Only audible when nothing is playing. Barely even an annoyance.* Side note - A firmware hack called SamyGo exists for Samsung smart TV's.

Not that I enjoy golf, I just had to watch something on my new TV.No buzzing that I can detect. The SmartTV features are extensive, and I'll probably start using Hulu or some streaming channel as long as 3D movies are streamed. If not, then I'll stick to the few DirecTV offerings.Things that helped steer my decision to go plasma instead of LCD-LED: 1) more screen size per dollar. 2) high scan rate of 600 Hz which means sports and fast action movies are flawless, 3) exceptionally high viewing angle (our movie room furniture forced this too) and finally CNET ratings gave this model the editor's choice and they said it was one of the best TVs they've ever tested. Not that I discounted the opinions of all of your wonderful Amazon raters, but CNET is very reputable, ya know.The screen auto-adjusts for ambient light level,  and that's a plus since our movie room has some natural light that is hard to control without drawing some heavy drapes in place. I'm going to use the Disney HD setup DVD to see what fine tuning I can do, but out of the box, the picture is really great, so I doubt that I'll have much tweaking to do.Once this system has been installed for a while, I'll update this review with more impressions, good or bad.------------Now let's talk about the shipping and not the TV. The TV arrived strapped to a pallet and the delivery guy had to be talked into helping me get it inside and up the stairs. I got him to agree only because they completely missed my delivery appointment on the day before and never bothered to call me or update me. I reminded him of that little inconvenient fact. I set the appointment with their dispatcher on the phone, so it's not like I left everything to chance. So if you live in the Houston TX area and your shipping notice says that Southwestern Motor Transport, Inc has your TV, call their dispatcher and make SURE they have your cell phone and house phone, then INSIST they update you with the expected delivery time if there is a delay.

I have not seen any flaws in this set and i'm phanical of quality pictures - another reason I have Fios - anyway the movie watching quality is the best I've ever seen. If you want a picture that throws you back with brightness and wow don't go here, buy yourself an LED but if your into pure movie like quality this is where you want to be. Avoid low end plasmas - if you can't afford the higher end plasmas you might consider not getting one. Samsung makes a pne606500 that is similar but with a single processor. They also make the 8000 series that has a different screen bezel but i could not see the difference especially considering the added cost.  The web functions are OK but not for me. never used them in my panas either. Too cumbersom. You want true computer capabilities on your TV get a laptop with HDMI connectability and a remote keyboard. otherwise keep your touchpad in your lap.The full HD3D is a whole new realm. the best you'll find and the 2D to 3D conversion is pretty good considering. Did upgrade the glasses to the better samsung sets which are fully automatic - on/off and rechargeable. I did not buy this TV for its 3D feature and tend not to use it much but you will at times just for the thrill.The sound is only good for general viewing. If you want good sound get yourself a Yamaha or Onkyo component  receiver system - both offer the best quality for the dollar.

I've been debating for months now over which TV to buy. Like the rest of you, you're likely considering the Panasonic or the Samsung. I chose the Samsung because while I was debating, I happen to notice that more than a few of my appliances in my home are Samsung including my gas range and my refrigerator and let me tell you I have been nothing but impressed with Samsung's products. The fact that the Samsung was about $300 cheaper made it just that much easier to choose.So I went on Amazon.com and purchased the TV. Here is where things got interesting. I got a phone call a couple days later from....lets call em Triple A's TV store. They wanted to confirm with me the delivery arrangements. He gives me the estimated delivery date and as luck would have it I would be working that day but I told him that would be fine, my wife will be there to let them in. He tells me that it didn't matter, they were only going to drop it at the curb anyway and that I would either need to take the day off to be there to bring it in or have someone else be available. Now at this time there is 2 feet of snow in my yard and no chance it's gonna melt anytime soon. Furthermore I have at the time of delivery to find out if there is anything wrong with it and return it at my cost within 72 hours. I told them thanks but no thanks! So my mistake was that in my haste to buy the TV, I didn't pay attention to the seller. I didn't buy it from Amazon! So I called Amazon and inquired about their delivery. Customer support reassured me and within days I get another call. This time by a delivery service intent upon my satisfaction. On my day off they came, brought it in and unpacked it. They set it up and even knew how to operate the remote. They took all the packaging away for me and waited until I was completely satisfied. From now on I'll buy from Amazon only!Now about the TV. I've never owned a Plasma before and all I can say is WOW! It's more than I had imagined. If you are concerned about the display being dimmer than an LCD, don't. It's more than bright enough and perfect for movies. Now the 3D....another big WOW! Unsurpassed 3D quality.

My Panasonic is several years old and had a 4\" border around the screen and this TV's border is about 1 1/2\" so even though this TV is 9\" larger, it fit in almost the same space as the Panasonic.I've only been using it for a day and still learning.  The picture is great, sound is good, it has the very good apps like Vudu.  The appearance is good but I'm still getting used to the chrome stand because it seems distracting.  I think a black stand would be better for a black TV.  I adjusted my picture and sound for watching TV and it looked great then watched a movie in Vudu.  With the Vudu movie, the screen seemed too dark so I adjusted the picture again and also had to adjust the sound.  I'm hoping the settings stay.  I have the ECO mode off but it still seems like the picture gets dimmer according to whether it's day or night so I'll have to watch that some more.Other reviews say there is buzzing but I can't hear any buzzing and there is very little heat.  Samsung says it may have a bad pixel or two and I looked close and only found one near the edge of the screen and I can't see it unless I'm a few inches from the screen.One thing I suggest for Samsung and most other TV and DVD makers is a new design of a remote is needed.  A square shaped remote would be easier to use.  The long slim remote is made for one hand but I can't use all those buttons with one hand and it's hard to hold it with two hands.  Also, I don't like dedicated buttons on a remote.  The button for Smart Hub is enough.  It's too easy to press the others by mistake.  They might work on a square remote though.:o(  This is the worst thing so far about this TV.  The remote also has a P Size button for when the picture does not fit the screen.  It is pretty much worthless.  It won't work on anything but the cable or sat TV signal and doesn't work very good for that.  My Panasonic's button for that worked on everything from TV to local media to streaming media to dvd media and I miss that already.  Maybe it can be fixed with software.I think it's a very nice TV but just a little more design for the use of it would make it a great TV.Update:  After watching the TV a few days, I think it is really hard to get the color adjusted so that black looks right.  This TV has too much black and no way to adjust it so it looks right.  I have black turned off in the settings and that one color is still too dark.  3 of 5 people on TV seem to wear black clothing and it shouldn't look like a \"cutout\" with no color, it should have tones.

Smart TVs have a long way to go before I would consider them smart compared to our other devices.The first app I looked for in the Samsung app store was an E-mail reader. There isn't one. Then I looked for an app that would allow me to use the qwerty keyboard on my iPhone to control the TV. I found some but when I tried to use them learned they will only work if the TV cable is connected directly to the TV. Who would buy a TV like this if that was the connection being used? Out TV cable is connected to a DVR which is then connected to our TV using the HDMI 1 port.I have decided to buy a mac mini to connect to one of the other HDMI ports.

We have had a tech come out 3 times to address the issue.  No fix has worked and the Samsung Tech has agreed there is an issue.  But customer support keeps giving us the runaround and says that because the fixes haven't worked than it must be that the specifications are right and it's just an issue with the 3D that is what it is.  I have had other 3D TVs and not had this problem.  Samsung translation is either, \"We don't care to deal with it\" or \"Our standard for quality on a top of the line plasma is lower than those of a cheaper 3D television.\"  Because of the poor customer service and addressing of the 3D glitch, I would never recommend this or any other Samsung product.

Great picture, great sound!  But it has not aged very well.First, I think the online services are pokey and not worth dealing with.  It's much more convenient to use a Roku or Xbox to access such services.  After a while the services became more of a nuisance when they would pop on and off for various reasons now and then.Second, I bought this Plasma specifically because it claimed to have solved the burn in problem.  NOT TRUE.  I selected all the burn in protection settings.  I even operated it safely for the first few months as some recommend.  I used the set to work out every morning with DVDs and I am sad to say that there is a P90X line permanently fused into the bottom of the TV, since the same P90X line is on every DVD in the same spot.  Although this is not always visable when watching TV, once you know it is there, it is hard not to notice..... It is always there!  At least I can prove I did P90X!Also, many claim that the plasma's are better for watching sports because of the faster refresh rate.  But I have a 120 hz Samsung LED upstairs, that works just fine for watching sports.  I really don't notice the difference.  Maybe some do...or maybe you could tell side by side, but I think a lot of it is in your head.Finally, the other day one of my kids threw a small flexible frisbee at the TV causing a very small crack in the upper corner.  The crack is very small about the size of pin hole, with an inch of spidering on the inside of the TV coming out from the crack.  You have to use a flashlight to see it.  This small crack totally destroyed the entire panel and made the TV worthless since all the gas escaped through the crack.  To repair it costs as much as a new TV.  I have another 50\" Plasma I bought in 2005 from Panasonic that has been beat-on, touched,  moved around and had stuff thrown at it for 9 years it has never cracked.  But the Samsung cracked with just one small incident.  You have to be kidding me.  They should at least build these TVs to be able to take a minor hit.  But they don't.I beleived at the time of my purchase, that the Plasma was sturdier than the LCD's because it had a thick outside glass protecting it.  But, this was a false belief.  I have now read that to save money they don't build the plasma's with a thick outside glass like the older TVs (like my Panasonic).  There was no protection at all for the Samsung Plasma.  So beware when you buy this TV.

Set still not fixed.  I am on my third main board, samsung refuses to replace set, and gives me the run around. I have lost time out of work, samsung puts you on hold and acts like they have no idea there is even a problem.  Last tech wrote up the set was still not fixed, and samsung refuses to replace set.  Some one did call back once, left a number, refuses to return any of my numerous calls.  Samsung is terrible, the worst, do not buy anything from them, ever.It appears Samsung TVs have no quality control (other than the consumer being stuck with a defective product, so if you got a good one, you are very lucky, but I suspect you will have problems at some point). Right out of the factory sealed box, my brand new new PN64E8000 top of the line 64\" Samsung Plasma is defective. (PN64E800 is same as UN64E7000 in regards to the problem, which you will see if you read on).  It is extremely difficult to get an HDMI connection. I tried 3 different cables, different cable manuafacturors, lastest ARC and 3D cables, and all 3 HDMI receptor slots. This in itself took hours of my time. The 3 HDMI receptor slots are in a multi input bar, which moves when you press on it. Yes, it actually moves. This is the design flaw.  I went to a store that happened to be setting up a UN65ES6500, a near top of the line LED, It has a similar HDMI connector plate which also moves. The UN65ES800 also appears to have a similar connector plate.  I recomend you go push on one for yourself before you buy. You can actually move it with one finger. Any Engineer knows that moving connections is a poor design. The specs are bad and need to be changed before the problem will go away.  If everything is just right, it may work for a few hook-ups and un-hook-ups, but it is likely to fail, probably after your one year warranty is up. Samsung customer service sent me an email confirming they received my request for support, then they closed my ticket without fixing TV. They will not re-open a ticket, I am on my third ticket now. I evenually reached the Executive Customer Relations Department, who claimed fixing the TV was not their responsability (quoting some fine print in their home warranty policy like they new it by heart). Basically what you have is a large 64\" TV, which they will not touch or move in any way, you have to provide the labor to get the TV flat on a table so they can work on it. This may be acceptable to strong young people, but if you are older, you may have to pay $500 or more to have TV put up and down. So you either need to shell out cash, or call in favors, so Sumsung can stick you with the hardest part of the repair.  Oh, and good luck finding a place to store this thing while it is down and you are waiting and waiting for Samsung to send a tech.  If you live in a big city it may be quicker, but where I am, the closest shop is 3 hours away in each direction, and I live 30 minutes from a good sized city.  The TV is huge and very very very very delicate. I actually heard the unit crack while the TV delivery guys did their intial unpacking, and I watched them the whole time, I do not know how they could do anything different.  So basically every time you (yes you) have to move it (so Samsung does not have to take responsability for their delicate product) you take a good chance of breaking it.  The hardest part is lowering it down to a flat position.  It has no lateral rigidity, and you can hear and possibly feel the set strain no matter how gentle you are.  The movers I had handle TVs all the time and were very carefull. Well, Samsung eventually refered me to the Office Of the Present@Sea.Samsung.Com, who will not accept phone calls. Without HDMI this set has limited value. The internet features take forever to navigate. The duel processor system is slow, slow, slow, SLOW!  This is regardless of your internet connection speed, the TV is just to slow to deal with all the non-vaule software you have to get through.  Two worthlessly slow processors are NOT better than one good one. Once you get through the slow and hard to use process of locating something you might want to see, it ends up either being a pay for service app or a short video with several commercials (except U-Tube, U-Tube is pretty great, at least for now, thanks U-Tube). So, I suspect Samsung deliberly has this approach of no quality control and then refusing to support the TV because they make money that way. All we can do is boycott all Samsung products and hope they go out of business, I suspect that they will never change a system that works for them. It may also be a good idea not to vote for these right wing Republican leaders who do not feel that consumer protection is the role of Gorernment. Oh, the voice control and motion control on the 8000 is crap, so that is one advantage of the 7000, if you can get one that works.Basically Samsung does not appear to inspect the tVs before they ship them out, at least not in a method that works. They rely on the comsumer to find the problems, then force the consumer to pay the most expensive part of the repair, which is hiring \"insured\" people to move the TV. Yes, I do recall that was one of their excuses, the insurance of moving the TVs was cost prohibative, that's probably because they make their TVs so delicate they break very easily, assuming it isn't already broken when you get it.UPDATE: Samsung says to fix the HDMI connectors they have to replace the entire main circuit.  This must mean that instead of just a panel of connectors, the connectors are hard wired onto the main very expensive circuit board.  This basically means that they have cut corners to the max and when Samsungs cheap faulty HDMI connections eventually fail, most people will be looking at a bill of several hundred dollars, perhaps even a $1,000.  Most people will just buy another TV, hopefully they will be smart enought to get another brand.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "A buzzing, no picture, cracked lemon....

I researched this model and compared to large LCD models, and the decision was easy once I saw how poor the viewing angle was with the large LCD models.Finally the TV was delivered.

Sound was pretty decent from the native speakers, though I purchased a Definitive Tech speaker system to handle sound.  For the most part, setup was easy and the apps that Samsung offers worked (except for Picasa App--despite numerous reloads and password re-entering, the app continually says my \"Account not Found\").I have read several reviews complaining about loud humming from the TV.  I can say without hesitation that IT IS TRUE.  What I can add to this however, is that the presence or absence of the humming is totally dependent upon what the SOURCE is that you are viewing.  The humming is loudest when you are using the web browser in Smart Hub.  When you select different sources, you will see the screen brighten (or dim) when the source is engaged.  When the screen dims, the humming is loudest.  Did not hear any humming when watching a movie via external Blu-ray player (my Playstation).  Fortunately, I have a very large room and am a fair distance (11 feet) away from the TV, so the humming isn't distracting unless there is no other sound--like when you are using the web browser.Watched 2 movies on it that looked great.  Streamed movies from Netflix and no problems.  Two weeks later, I was watching a show via Netflix with my son when--\"CLICK\" and screen went black!  From that point on, whenever I tried to turn on the TV, it would give one quick flicker of light, then go black, and the red \"Power\" light in the lower left-hand corner would blink slowly 5 times then go out.Chatted my problem with Samsung Tech support via Chat box on the Samsung site.  Result:  Service Technician will need to come and repair the TV.  They set up an appointment for a full week later.  6 days later, we called Samsung to verify that the technician would come the next day.  The local repair service called us and said \"Oh, we just ordered the part we need, it will be another week.\"  Exactly how they know what part needed to be ordered before anyone actually came to the house to see the TV is an interesting point.  However, my strong suspicion is that this problem is WIDESPREAD with this model of Samsung TV.  I see class action lawsuits online over this issue.So, I have a $2300 piece of glass on my wall that has been dead for more time than it worked.  I asked Samsung (after waiting the first week) if they would send me another unit instead.  \"You will have to contact the seller and ask for an exchange.\"  Of course, the seller won't exchange the TV, and tells me to contact Samsung for repairs instead.

I told them that by omitting burn-in from their warranty, they were in fact ADMITTING that it was a problem that they expected to happen. Otherwise, they would stand behind their product. They then suggested that to avoid burn-in, I should watch different channels throughout the day. Seriously, this was their solution.

It was a good price and I have always been a big fan of Amazon.  When making a purchase like this, it's important to trust the seller.

My advice to anyone is to inquire with Amazon whether CEVA does the delivery, and if so -- do not buy the product.  Only buy the product if a company other than CEVA is making the delivery.I had an appointment window for delivery from 9am to 12pm.  I took a morning off from work and waited.  And waited.  At 12pm I called CEVA and was told the delivery would be late.  \"How late,\" I asked the CEVA rep.  \"I don't know\" was her amazingly non-responsive response.  I asked her why I wasn't contacted when the delivery was late.  She said that CEVA didn't do that.I asked her to try to contact the driver.  She put me on hold, and then came back and said she couldn't reach him.  I told her that was unacceptable and she needed to try again.  I was angry, but controlling it.  The CEVA rep, however, was giving me real attitude.  She came back and said \"probably about an hour.\"I then called Amazon to complain.  As always, Amazon was great.  Amazon called, got a more or less exact time of 45 minutes, and offered to refund the delivery fee of approximately $65.00.Great?  Well -- I thought so, until CEVA arrived.I live in a townhome that is up one flight of stairs from the street.  I could see the truck -- and there was only one person in it.  How in the world was one person going to deliver the 65\" TV?The answer, of course, was that I was expected to help him.  In my coat and tie, dressed for work, I helped the CEVA driver carry the TV up the stairs -- in the rain.  Of course I had to shower and change my clothes again before I went to work.I asked the guy what would happen if an elderly person or someone with disabilities was getting a delivery.  He said he'd have to call in for back-up and then wait for a second person to arrive.I thought the worst was over -- but I was wrong.  This guy had absolutely no idea of how to install the base to the TV.  He couldn't find the screws.  He had brought no tools, but fortunately I had a screwdriver for him to use.  We poured over the instruction manual together, and together put the TV on the stand.  I did most of the work.  He gasped and huffed in a way that suggested he might expire in my home.  And during his flailing about trying to get the TV on the stand, he knocked the volume knob off my new Denon receiver, purchased from Amazon, and having arrived only yesterday.The TV is now up and running.  The picture seems beautiful, although I haven't had any time to really do more than see that it turned on.  When I get home, I'm going to take another look at the stand and make sure it really is secure.  I'd prefer Amazon send someone out to check it for me.My last TV was purchased from a big box store.  A two person team delivered it, carried my old TV wherever I wanted, put the stand on in seconds, and then connected all the cables, even taking time to show me how the remote worked and making suggestions for calibrating the picture.  With Amazon's contractor CEVA, I will be happy if the TV doesn't fall off the stand.  And Amazon -- if anyone is reading this -- you need to send someone to my home to check it.  I won't complain about the Denon knob (which is probably fine) if you check to make sure the stand is properly installed.So the bottom line:  all the internet retailers had this TV for the same price over Labor Day weekend.  I purchased from Amazon because I trust Amazon.  I buy almost everything from Amazon -- huge user of Amazon Prime.  I think what bothers me the most here is that my confidence in Amazon has been shattered.And my advice to you is only to buy a TV if you get a guarantee that some company other than CEVA is delivering it.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "not so good", "Author": "john", "ReviewID": "R34ZT0I9FQSP8A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought samsung 60\" TV 10 years ago, I got problem after about 10 days, the TV turn off after 10 minutes, i got fixed it, then nothing happy to this May 2012, it turns off after several minutes.so I changed to the latest NP60E7000, in May 2012, i got the similar problem today, the TV turn off every 4 minutes and turn on itself.I have to call and get fix again.I do not know if this is popular problem in samsung TV?john", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$3,399.99", "Features": "Smart Interaction\nSignature Services\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi\nFull HD 2D and 3D\nTV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 58.5-Inch x 38.8-Inch x 13.8-Inch, TV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 58.5-Inch x 34.8-Inch x 1.9-Inch", "Name": "Samsung PN64E7000 64-Inch 1080p 600Hz 3D Ultra Slim Plasma HDTV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510WgPZ2-NL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0077SF3VY"}}
