{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Vizio TV", "Author": "Love Technology", "ReviewID": "R3T0H49GEKYPT6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "6/2/2013 OK here is my latest update on satisfaction with this TV.I have two major things that really irk me with this TV set.1) First this TV can take up to 8 to 10 seconds to sync/display some TV stations when switching TV cable channels, it will display a black screen during that time period.  If the TV looses sync during a program due to a loss of channel sync by the cable carrier it can take 8 seconds to go from a black screen to resuming picture play back.2) I use a Sony sound bar with this TV and it is connected to the digital optical output of the TV. I have constant lip sync problems that really drive me crazy, voice and video are not in sync!This week the TV is exactly one year old.  I paid $900 for it a year ago and was trying to find a way to justify replacing it.  I figured that if I sold it I would probably get $300 for it, and my wife would probably kill me.  Well as luck would have it my college age daughter told me that the Vizio TV that I purchased for her in 2009 was dying, i.e. LCD back light was going bad! So much for Vizio quality. I decided to seize the opportunity and offered to give her my 47\" one year old Vizio.  So now she is very happy! I'm also very happy because I went out and purchased this years Samsung 55\" TV model (see my other reviews). I am happy to say that no longer do I suffer from channel lag when switching TV channels and no longer do I have a lip sync problem when using my Sony surround sound bar.I have purchased my last Vizio product.  I have had 2 Vizio TV's and a Vizio sound bar and all have had problems.  Yes I paid a steep premium for my Samsung TV, but I love it.  I also have a Samsung TV purchased in 2006 and it's problem free.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vizio background: Vizio is a privately held US corporation, with about 417 employees. Unlike other TV manufacturers Vizio handles design, engineering, and over sees manufacturing for their TV's but outsources the manufacturing to 3 different companies in China, Taiwan, and Mexico. Vizio's philosophy is to sell quality TV's at value prices.  Vizio doesn't spend money on marketing and passes on the savings to its customers that purchase their products through Amazon and warehouse clubs.This is a 47\" Vizio LED - LCD with Internet and 3D, this TV has all the latest features. The sound quality is average on this TV.  It also has 4 HDMI ports, and comes with 4 pairs of 3D glasses, and also has wireless connectivity.  I bought the TV because of features, cost and because I wanted passive 3D not the active 3D that comes with expensive battery operated glasses.Why do I care about 4 HDMI outputs?  Well this is now the de facto norm for best connectivity options.Connections:1) HDMI for Comcast cable box. If you want to receive 3D you will need to upgrade to a Cisco RNG 200 cable box (standard issue Comcast cable box doesn't support 3D). The only connection on the Cisco that supports 3D connectivity is HDMI.2) HDMI for DVD/Blu-Ray player3) HDMI for new laptops that have HDMI output that will allow you to surf the Internet on your computer and view and listen to the output on your TV. I've used this to play episodes of missed TV programs from my local PBS website.4) HDMI one port to spare that I am sure will come in handy for something.The colors on this TV are really vivid, it makes you feel like you are right in the action!  We also tried out the 3D feature and are very pleased with it.Adjustment for Watching Movies:  My wife started complaining that this TV didn't play back the movies right!  I didn't know what she was talking about. Looking back on the situation the best way to describe it is that all action on DVD playbacks looked artificially smooth, more like a smooth swan dance. I decided to research it and found out that this TV has a 240 Hz sampling rate to get rid of blurs on fast moving screen action.  Well this 240 hz sampling up conversion apparently repeats frames and inserts new frames to accomplish what is does.  The result is that the play back of movies from my DVD player didn't look right.  In order to fix this go into Advanced picture settings and turn off the reduce motion blur feature and your movies will now play as they should.Second adjustment:  Tired of that annoying lighted Vizio logo on the front of the TV? Go into picture settings and turn off the display of the Vizio logo!  Now the logo comes on briefly when you turn the TV on and then goes off!Exiting 3D Mode: You can enter 3D mode by selecting the 3D button on the remote or from the on screen menu.  The only way I was able to get out of the 3D mode was to shut the TV off.  In order to exit 3D your supposed to select \"2D Mode\" from the menu options. To make it more user friendly the option should be labeled \"Exit 3D mode\".Remote control: Yes the remote control is small, but I don't use it as I have a Logitech Harmony One remote. At some point in time I may have to add an applet and will probably have to use the remote keyboard function which I have never used.Another advantage of using the Logitech Harmony Remote is that it has the ability to select the correct input when switching between modes. It selects the input source without having to cycle through all the inputs one at a time to get to the desired input!User manual:  The user manual is located on the Vizio website. No need to print it as it can be downloaded and saved to your computer as a pdf file.  This will allow you to access the user manual anytime you have a need to do so.Warranty considerations: Prior to making a Vizio purchase you may want to call Vizio or check their website for a list of authorized dealers, there are about 6 of them. Vizio will only honor a warranty claim if the item is purchased from an authorized dealer.  To better understand Vizio warranty issues read the user reviews for the VIZIO VHT510 Surround Sound System.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "We returned the set. 3D was unreliable.", "Author": "CenVillager \"cenvillager\"", "ReviewID": "RGAG8N0J9U5VX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "FINAL UPDATE:A problem surfaced regarding the 3D rendering. It started to work only occasionally. The 3D image failed to show 3D. The registration was off. The images could not sync together correctly to produce a 3D image.When the problem surfaced,  I wasn't certain whose fault it was -  the TV, or the Comcast signal, or the Motorola DVR box that fed the TV.On two occasions the set froze and even the manual buttons on the side of the TV failed to work. After unplugging the set and replugging into the electric, it rebooted.However the next time it happened I phoned Vizio Technical Support. She told me to once again unplug the set to reboot the computer in the TV. I did so and the 3D still failed to work. She said that the set \"gets confused\" by changing from 2D to 3D. She added that rebooting the set should've solved the issue but when even the rebooting failed it was time for them to send out a Service Technician to fix the TV.With only one week left in the Amazon trial period and with the realization that the software issue could easily recur anytime, I decided that the TV was so unreliable that it wasn't worth it. So we returned the set using Amazon's wonderful Return system. If it had been a hardware issue I could live with a quick repair, but software was a different matter. The Tech knew of no pending software updates to fix this issue.I have now ordered the Panasonic Viera 3D, TC-L47ET5 from Amazon.EARLIER COMMENTS:PROs:The picture is excellent, both regular TV and 3-D, after adjusting and tweaking the default settings. Picture quality and price are two big reasons for buying a particular brand of TV. Considering the reasonable price, this Vizio TV is a bargain.3D:The 3D is amazing. The screen disappears and becomes a window you are looking through. Not only that but in some scenes objects appear to be floating in front of the TV, by as much as 30 inches! Incredible!  Great job, Vizio! Can't wait for the X-Games and the Olympics, both in 3D this year.CONs:My cons are mainly annoyances and things requiring getting used to.Several are what I consider design defects by Vizio.The Remote:The keys are tiny. Definitely not suitable for anyone with large fingers. The entire remote measures 2\" X 6\". The section with the keys on the front measures 2\" X 4\", not much room for all the keys on it.The \"3D\" key is almost lost at the bottom of the number keys instead of being prominent like the \"V\" key. The 3D key is nearly impossible to find in the dark as the keys are not backlit.I wonder if the word \"Vizio\" is adapted from a word meaning \"Patience.\" There is a very slow response time between key press and TV reaction. Before I realized this I pressed keys too quickly and the TV froze up. The keys failed to respond and even the manual buttons on the side of the TV failed to respond. I had to unplug the TV to get it to reboot. I have since learned patience.User Guide:Starts you off with internet settings, rather than TV.Not printed. The startup guide is marginally useful. The in-depth operational details are in the online manual (not even a CD provided) and require the user to download and print out the manual. You would think that considering the cost of the TV they would spend the nominal amount to give you a printed manual.The manual refers to a TV mode of \"Sensio\" but fails to explain what it is.TV:Do not be concerned if the initial TV picture color looks, well, awful.This TV requires much fine tuning through many levels of submenus to get decent color. I enjoy playing with settings and submenus so it was an enjoyable experience for me. Non-techies will have a harder time.It is very disappointing that the TV fails to recognize which type of 3D is incoming. There are two flavors of 3D signal, \"above and below\" or \"side by side\". This requires the user to go to the 3D menu and select the correct 3D source. A tedious four step process considering how slowly the TV responds to each key press. Then when you want to return to 2D TV you must go through the process again.  A quicker method not found in the manual is to locate and press the tiny 3D key at the bottom left of the alphabet. I am hoping that Vizio will come up with a software enhancement that can recognize the type of 3D signal.This TV is definitely not \"Instant On\". It is \"Press and Wait\".  When you turn on the TV it takes several seconds for even the Vizio logo to light up, then an additional approximately 15 seconds for a picture to appear.Be aware that on some key pressed the screen will go black. Not to worry. It is working on your key press and will eventually bring the picture back with your change. It would be helpful if there were an onscreen icon of some sort showing that the TV is working, such as that little moving circle that PCs use to communicate \"working\".Internet Ready:This TV is internet ready. It accepts either a wireless or wired internet connection. There are several apps that are preloaded on the TV. Many more are available. Many of the apps require a paid subscription to an internet provider. You can do streaming video or movies easily once the connection is made. YouTube is free.There is no internet browser app, nor an email app. I will miss both. The largest button on the remote, the \"V\" key, connects you to the app display. I have enough movies through my Comcast DVR that I won't use this much, but it does work. The wireless antenna is robust inasmuch as my router is some distance away from the set and although my PC sometimes has trouble getting the signal at that distance, the TV has no such trouble.One design deficiency IMHO is that the V internet button is huge while the 3D button is tiny. Both should be at least the same size. It is annoying that the button I don't use is right there while I have to search for the 3D button.The reverse of the remote is a full keyboard. Super convenient for use with the internet apps.Packaging:The packaging of the TV is excellent. Styrofoam sections are cut out and framed to support the TV without it touching the sides of the sturdy box. You should save the box in case you need to ship the TV somewhere for service (or to return to Amazon). My suggestion is to take notes, or better yet, pictures, as you remove the styrofoam pieces and the TV from the box so that you will be able to repackage the set correctly.CONCLUSION:I bought this TV rather than another make I was interested in because of Amazon's excellent offer of free shipping and a 30 day trial and free return shipping if I am not satisfied with it. I didn't know if 3D TV would be worth it so this was a no risk way to try it out.We are getting used to the idiosyncrasies of the TV. I gave this TV four stars because of them. If the remote were better it would rate five stars.So we will happily keep the TV, unless, of course, something bad happens in the three weeks remaining in my trial period. If I return it for some as yet unknown reason, I will update this review.REVIEW UPDATE 6/29/2012:We are halfway through our 30 day trial of this TV.The picture continues to be excellent, both regular and 3D. Our new record for the distance an object appears to be floating in front of the screen stands at four feet!We have gotten used to the \"annoyances\" I mentioned earlier. It didn't take long. Now using the remote is automatic and even the time delays are no longer noticeable.I have learned a shortcut method for changing the TV modes, from 2D to 3D. Instead of using the cumbersome \"Menu\" button, I place my finger on the smooth empty space at the bottom of the remote and slide the finger up to the tiny 3D key at the bottom left of the numbers pad. Then repeated presses of the 3D key and a tap of the \"OK\" key switches between modes.So unless something unexpected happens during the remainder of the trial, this TV is here to stay.  If need be I will update this review.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything is great so far", "Author": "12watch", "ReviewID": "R1IKA3B8BYWDK3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This my first HDTV. I spent a lot of time reading customer reviews and comparing prices. I finally settled on this tv because I wanted 3d (not so much for now, but figuring it was the wave of the future and I wanted a tv that would have the feature three years from now) and CNET gave it a very good rating (there weren't that many reviews out on the product yet). Vizio did get good reviews on its other 47\" LCD 3d TV (E3D470VX) so I figured this tv would be just as good, but with 240 HZ instead of 120 HZ.I was originally going to get it from Sam's Club because it was $50 dollars cheaper there; however, Amazon has the low price guarantee. So I ordered it from Amazon. I had to email them a day after it arrived to ask about the guarantee because there was no \"lower cost\" button that I could see on the order page. There was no hassle in having them credit me the lower price and Sam's Club had reduced it another $50. So, besides getting the same price as Sam's Club, I saved sales tax ($50).I ordered it on a Monday morning. I have Prime so I had free 2 day delivery; however, for $3.99 more they offered next day delivery. The tv was delivered Tuesday afternoon. Set up was a breeze. Basically, all I needed to do was screw 8 screws in to attach the base to the tv and it was ready to go (the power cord was even plugged into the back). I plugged the coaxial cable into the tv, turned it on and it went into set up mode. A quick start booklet does come with the tv which was very helpful and I downloaded the user manual from Vizio for future reference.I have had absolutely no problems with the tv. The picture looks great (I also connected the tv through my cable box and the HDMI connection). I was surprised when I hooked it up originally just through the coax cable that all the local channels also had HD signals. Of course, through the cable box I know have full access to all HD channels. I connected it to the internet (very easy to do) and connected the facebook app and also an app for my local tv channel website. I am a little disappointed that the web pages don't come up full screen (they only use about 25% of the left side of the tv). Maybe I am just missing a setting.I did plug a thumb drive into the USB port with a movie I had downloaded from the internet. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it looked on the tv.My major disappointment is that it doesn't seem as if the remote is programmable so that I can add my cable box to it. That would have been nice.I believe my cable provider does offer streaming 3d movie. If they do, I will update this review. As of now, I believe for the money, this was a great purchase!", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Nice for the Price", "Author": "D. Lasniewski", "ReviewID": "R3EBZZ0P8A2MS9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using it for a month now and am happy with the picture.  I previously was using an excellent Sony 40\" LCD XBR but wanted a larger screen that would just fit in my alcove space and this 47-inch was perfect.I have noticed a few things compared with my previous setup which, as before, includes a PS3, a Sony A/V sound system and a Comcast cable box (which I had to upgrade for 3D).  First, the CEC Function on the TV doesn't seem to do anything to control the rest of my Sony equipment.  Before the Sony TV worked fine controling the audio and turning the A/V on/off at the same time I did so on the TV.  So, I think the Sony \"Bravia Sync\" is incompatible with the Vizio CEC eventhough Sony's website states: \"With the \"Control for HDMI\" function, \"BRAVIA\" Sync helps to communicate with \"BRAVIA\" Sync-compatible equipment using HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control).\"  Yea, right!  Next, the \"SRS StudioSound HD\" for the TV's speakers hardly ever does anything.  By that I mean I think I have noticed it working a couple of times, almost accidently, then disappearing.  Whenever I turn it off and on I don't hear any difference.  Maybe its intermittent.  But since I plan to use my A/V system most of the time I decided not to make an issue of it.  Next, when using the A/V system for sound the audio is out-of-sync with the TV video (lip movements don't match the voice) when using the HDMI for the audio. I have also noticed this problem on some Netflix streaming content using the TV's speakers as well but you can take care of it with the Lip Sync audio adjustment in the TV menus.  But this problem never occurred with the Sony TV and the adjustment didn't even exist.  To fix the problem when using the A/V to drive external speakers you will have to connect the TV to your A/V system using the Digital Optical audio output from the TV. So, if I may conclude, if things are designed correctly you don't need this Lip Sync adjustment.  Next, I didn't know my existing HDMI A/V system wouldn't work with a 3D DVD played from my PS3.  My ignorance. You have to have a 3D-capable A/V system for this eventhough the video should be a pass-through, so I had to direct-connect my PS3 to another HDMI input on the TV (but this comment is just FYI since it has nothing to do with the TV).  Next, I don't know if the Vizio's 240-Hz update rate helps or hinders jerky motion.  I thought it was suppose to help but my old Sony had less of this \"judder\" look and it was 120-Hz and looked better (and I don't think this opinion has anything to do with the size of the screen).  Next, After reading a lot of reviews and comments I decided I wouldn't worry about the lack of resolution of the passive(cheap) method of 3D implementation.  Alas, there isn't much 3D to look at anyway.  I watched a 3D DVD and is was great.  And, if the future of Sensio (included in the TV's 3D selection) is rosy, the other active 3D option that many other higher priced TVs provide, (many without glasses) won't matter much.  However, I wish the TV could automatically select the type of 3D signal being received and also change between 2D/3D without going through about 4-button pushes.  Its not conveinent as it is.  Next, the TV's screen is shinier than my old Sony was but not as reflective as some. Since I don't have any windows in front of the TV it hasn't mattered.  Next, since I have a PS3, I have no comments on the TV's wireless network capability.  Next, as mentioned by others, there is no hardcopy manual provided.  I would like a nice little booklet instead of having to refer to (or print) the 68-pager downloaded from the Vizio website.  Next, I'm not doing too much with the remote (like using the keyboard) so have no problems with it.All in all, for the price, I love this TV so far.BTW, before buying it and planning for the installation, I tried to get specific information on the location of the mounting hole pattern on the back of the TV.  I contacted the Vizio technical support via email for this.  I either got no information or wrong information from my multiple requests. What I could have used was this:  The hole pattern is 6 1/4 inches up from the bottom edge of the TV.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but it has faults.", "Author": "Robert Elmasian", "ReviewID": "RPADR1BO9I5WW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The M3D470KD and its siblings in Visio's M series offer a very good bang-for-the-buck in a near state-of-the-art HDTV, although I hope and expect it to be surpassed in future months and years.  The Visio's greatest asset is its outstanding picture, the essential feature of any TV.  When given the right media, even the 3D feature is outstanding.As much as I like the M3D470KD, it does have some problems, starting with the firmware which while generally useable is clunky.  For example, when entering strings in app search boxes, the numeric number pad does not always work, although one can navigate to the on screen keyboard to enter the number instead.  It is also hard to select a USB port for inputting media.  Using the \"input\" button on the remote fails even when a flash drive is already inserted in the TV because the USB ports are not in the list that appears; you have to go through the settings menu and even then you might have to turn off and then turn on the TV. Indeed, the manual warns that you should turn off the TV before either inserting or removing a USB flash drive or you risk unspecified damage. I also do not appreciate that 3D apparently will not work unless you get it via the tuner, from an Internet app, or a 3D Blu ray drive.  I have a 3D portable that uses the same LG FPR technology the Visio uses, but when I send the TV 3D material via HDMI, the 3D area of the menu system is not accessible, and 3D does not function on the screen.  As other reviews mention, this Visio lacks an Internet browser app, something that would be easy to add if only Visio would do it.  Perhaps, the worst fault, however, is the sound.  There are no holes for speakers facing the front of the TV.  High frequency sounds, which cannot bend around obstacles like low frequencies, are drastically attenuated.  This is O.K. for watching the news but falls far short if you want to watch a concert.  Fortunately, the problem can be ameliorated by simply attaching a pair of small, front-facing computer speakers to the headphone port, although optically connecting a sound bar would be better.In summary,the M3D470KD is a great TV, but it has faults.  While there is a lot of room for improvement, given the competition and the rapid, often confusing development of smart TV's, I do not see a clearly better choice now. I would buy the Visio again.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best TV for the dollar", "Author": "Stuart Weis", "ReviewID": "R28MDMPV6FF9GD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing an immense amount of research (consumer reports, cnet, forums, etc.) I ultimately settled for this TV over similarly priced (meaning under $1000 USD) plasmas and LEDs.I ultimately decided on the Vizio because from what I read, the color levels, including black level, are among the best for an LED in general. If you have the money and are willing to spend it then I would recommend a Sony Bravia or the highest end Samsungs simply because they have a wider color set and deeper black levels. But what makes this TV so impressive is that the picture quality is literally splitting hairs- if they are 10s, this is a 9.5 and at hundreds less. Vizio also has some impressive features with the beautiful screen:-240hz refresh rate, which is a must for a strong 3D picture AND gives a beautiful smoothness to gaming-An ingenious remote for the menus: one side is a standard TV remote while the other is a full QWERTY keyboard which allows for searching on programs such as netflix a breeze.-A great 3D picture and 4 battery-less 3D glasses. The glasses not requiring batteries or a charge is a double bonus because it is easier to manage and they are lightweight and non-cumbersome.-Smart TV so it includes Hulu+ and Netflix (only so far having tested netflix the streaming quality is exceptional)Overall, this isn't the most futuristic looking TV or the best TV on the market, but the TV to dollar ratio, quality for the price, is second to none. If you are on more of a budget when looking for a TV, this one has every bell and whistle you want with a strong picture.Also, I hope the following will help to guide your purchase on what type of TV if you still can't decide between LED or Plasma:Plasmas have come a long way and a lot of misconceptions still hold true. The modern plasmas do not truly experience a problem with image retention in a permanent sense, which is usually the knock on plasmas. The only real problem is that the color can be severely washed out in well lit to bright rooms. If you are planning on a TV for a basement or anywhere with thick blinds to control the lighting around the TV during the day or simply only use it during night then I would recommend looking at the Panasonic plasma TV line.LED TVs cannot (for the most part) hit the color depth (specifically in the black levels) of plasma but are significantly better in lit rooms and are not much worse in dark rooms than plasma. Basically, if you have a TV for your living room and want an all around TV the advantages plasma have in black level are so small compared to a really good LED TV versus the huge gap in color washout from glare. This is simply from the brightness of the LED lights on the TV allow a higher brightness content to create a picture to still appear sharp during the day. This is ultimately why I choose an LED because the TV is for my apartment and not a basement-style setup.I hope this review helps and that people can shop smart and find the TV that best suits their own wants and needs.

Their \"Best HDTV (44-49 Inches)\" was the Vizio M3D470KD. All the lessor rated HDTV's on their list were slightly to significantly more expensive. They write: \"It boasts black levels and color accuracy that surpass competitors costing hundreds more, making it one of the elite values in its class. Very good picture quality and an extremely aggressive price make the Vizio M3D0KD one of the best LED TV values on the market.\"But then I ran across the fella in these reviews who returned this Vizio for a Panasonic VIERA TC-L47ET5. However I then found an article at PCMag that directly compared the two head to head. Their conclusion was that the Vizio was a MUCH better HDTV at a MUCH lower price.Since it was for the bedroom and, thus, not our primary/main TV I was not too interested in the Internet Apps nor the 3D. But when it came down to purchasing it this set was only $30 more than the Vizio without the Apps and 3D--so I figured why not get them for a lousy 30 guacamoles extra.We've had the TV for 3 months now and I have yet to turn it on without being totally delighted with, and impressed by, the picture. (Someone mentioned in these reviews that the picture improved over time. I was skeptical at that but now I wonder whether there might be some truth in it.) My other HDTV's all have \"Matt\" screens and the \"Semi-Gloss\" screen on this, by comparison, makes it appear \"almost Plasma\" like.Haven't used the Internet Apps much but using the Wizard that appeared when I first plugged in the TV flawlessly connected it wirelessly to my modem.

Bergin", "ReviewID": "R20WEBUK1M2WYY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So my last TVs, HD camcorders, & BluRay player all Sonys but got tired of paying for Sony's \"name\" and not getting what I'd been really expecting from Sony so I went with this Vizio.  Thus far it's beautiful. Out of the box setup is simple as it can get, hookups are simple and well marked, but there's one major problem.  Thus far my Sony BluRay player lists NO codes for Vizio and Sony's statement on their site is something to the effect of you can try other codes but this can be very time consuming.  Duh!  My Onkyo 7.1 Surround Stereo lists codes for Vizio but none of them work.  I e-mailed Onkyo and was told \"Since the only codes we have available are 5 digit coes; please try the following:  1758, 1175, 1220, 2209.\"  That's quoted directly from their e-mail!  My Onkyo manual lists ONLY 4 digit codes so clearly something has changed there in the past 4 or so years (but should I have to replace a 1000W 7.1 surround system every 4 years?).  That's absurd.As for the TV itself.  Honestly, it's almost too good.  The picture quality is stunning.  BluRay discs, HD cable TV, HD clear QAM recordings using Windows Media Center in Windows 7 x64 are stunning (all via HDMI).  I thought my last TV, a Sony WEGA HD TV (limited to 720p or 1080i) was good until this one (remember I'm using the same disc player, same Win7 box, same cable box, same HDMI cables, the only change is the TV).For those with complaints about the Vizio remote, you're dead on.  The keyboard is a sorry excuse for a keyboard.  The lack of an input button to just flip between 3 inputs (and you can't disable the other 6 (there are 9 total)) is ridiculous.  My 6+ year old Sony TV had this ability!  I use 3 HDMI connections and that's it.  I should be able to disable the other inputs.  Also, there needs to be a \"Sleep\" button on the remote NOT Amazon, Netflix, and Vudu buttons.I'd give this TV 5 stars if the remote were better and if it worked well with others (sorry, Vizio is the new kid on the market so they need to design their devices to work with the good 'ole boys and not expect them to work with them, there's no reason Vizio can't use the same basic transmission options as other vendors so that basic things like turning on the TV and switching between inputs work - that's actually ALL I need on my Onkyo audio system remote since I don't change channels on the TV, but I have to find the TV remote to turn it on so I can watch anything!).  If you're willing or have very new components I highly recommend this TV thus far, if you have anything 3 or 4 years old that still does what you want I'd look elsewhere for a TV that plays well with others.", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "this is the best Television", "Author": "SJ", "ReviewID": "RT4UYUNAQ6S4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am starting from1) Remote control- This is really a new technology.

The Vizio is much brighter being an LED tv. When hooked up to AT&T; Uverse you can see a difference in the blacks.

I wanted a Samsung but the price was just not a right fit for me.The 3d picture is very crisp. There are not any noticeable lines in the picture and the depth of the 3d is as good as if not better than the 3d that you see at the theater.CONS:The remote is just okay three times thicker than my Galaxy S3 (although the full keyboard on the back is nice).Does not look as nice as some of the top brand LED tvs.The sound is just okay but with the price being so low you can afford a sound bar or a nicer sound system.Final thought:The problems I have do not have  anything to do with why I  purchased this tv.

My son and daughter-in-law asked for a recommendation for a high performance but low priced smart TV of approx 50\" for their just-purchased first home. It turns out that the Living Room where their new Home Theater system would live has lots of windows - so daytime reflectivity was an issue that eliminated many contenders with highly reflective screens (not always considered, but very important).After extensively researching & viewing the contendors, the choice became clear - Vizio's M3D470KD with local dimming was the surprise (to me) winner. I was there when it arrived and connected, set up, & calibrated the set myself. There were absolutely no issues; everything worked exactly as it should, including Netflix. Picture quality for the price was stunning. The screen is not matte, but reflectivity was controlled and not distracting, more than acceptible for daytime viewing with blinds open.3D was not a factor in purchasing this set. We watched one movie in 3D just to confirm that it worked OK. It seemed fine. Having 4 pairs of 3D glasses meant the whole family could watch it together. Otherwise I have little to say about its 3D performance.My only glitch was not being able to get the discrete Power ON & OFF IR codes from Vizio for the Harmony remote control. Since my time at their house was limited, I just used the toggle Power IR code. While this will probably result in occasionally having the TV out of synch with the other components, I hope to find the codes elsewhere and fix this on my next trip.Otherwise I thought the TV's performance, operation, build quality & appearance were remarkable for the price (they paid $850) and recommend it highly. (Note this review is for the KD version only; the more recent and less expensive KDE model lacks some of the technologies like local dimming that makes this set such a performance champ).", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best value in TV's", "Author": "Mark D.", "ReviewID": "R3VAGP3OIMFR31", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Vizio HD television. Because we like to watch movies, the first was a plasma 1080i which served us well and had a great picture. I sold it to buy this one. For the price, the picture on this 1080p HD TV is superb. It handles fast action movies without a problem, with an extremely clear/sharp picture. There are also plenty of setting to adjust the color and temperature the way you like it. So far the internet apps have worked as advertised once the firmware was pushed. The only thing we did not like was the soap opera effect (caused by the game smoothing setting ) set as default out of the box. It makes movies look like a TV show. Once we learned how to turn the setting off, we were in business. We have not tried the 3D capabilities yet. I would definitely recommend buying this 1080p 240Hz Razor LED Smart 3D TV.

It is everything I expected, and more. There actually is a newer model of this version, the m3d470kde, and the only difference I can see is in price (more expensive) and the refresh speed: 120Hz on the newer model, which is rated as slower than my older model listed as 240 Hz.. (Go figure that the older one is 240). I've had it for about a month now.The TV is attractive, with a black border and ultra thin, hence the \"Razor\" name. The LED picture is crystal clear, with deep blacks and brilliant colors. The 3D is impressive, using the passive glasses without any batteries or wires needed as with the active glasses. It comes with all of the hookups I needed, including 4 HDMI inputs, and the usual coaxial, RGB, and RCA inputs. The optical output allowed me to hook up the TV directly to my ancient Pioneer receiver for surround sound, with the aid of an optical to RCA converter I purchased at Radio Shack for around $40. You will need to add some kind of sound enhancement to this TV also, as the TV comes with tiny little speakers which sound like crap. (But I already knew this from the previous reviews of this model.)The TV comes with Internet Apps, which can be connected both hard-wired and wirelessly. My wireless connection does the job, and was really easy to connect. This is where the included remote really comes in handy. It is not a slider, as the new model uses, but actually has a QWERTY keyboard on the back of the remote, making inputs really easy and fast - no more using the arrow keys to move around and pick letters and numbers. You can access Netflix, Hulu and all of the other apps that usually come included in Smart TV's.My recommendation is to consider buying this model. There are other TV's available in this size, and I'm sure some are considered better quality, such as Samsung and Sony, but for the money it is a great value. My amateur eye cannot tell the difference when comparing side by side in the stores, and I didn't see any ball blur that the slower models exhibited while watching sports. Kids of all ages will love the 3D features. Finding Nemo in 3D was amazing.

For the price it is a fantastic 47\" television with a feature set that can't be touched by other manufacturers. My understanding is Vizio makes money on volume which allows them to sell televisions at a lower cost than other manufacturers such as Samsung or LG. The color reproduction is excellent after calibrating (I used the recommended numbers from another reviewer of the television) and the quality of the television stats match TV's costing twice as much.That said, similar to what other reviewers have said, there are a few downsides - some more nitpicky than others. The television is not instant-on. After turning on the television it takes several moments for anything to appear on the screen. I've stopped noticing after a few weeks, but every once in a while I will catch myself wondering if I have actually turned the television on. Also, the screen doesn't seem to exhibit the same brightness as other televisions that makes everything seems to pop off the screen. It could be just an issue of color saturation, but after playing with the settings I am not convinced this is the case. What has caught my attention is the amount of blooming and backlight bleed that shows during dark scenes. I am told this is normal for most edge-lit television screens, but it is disappointing nonetheless. I hear 3D is done well on the television (and comes with four pairs of glasses), but I have no 3D source and there is no 2D to 3D conversion on the television so I can't make any comment. That said, if something was created in 2D I can't imagine there is any amount of processing that would make the 3D worth watching.Another downfall worth mentioning is the software on the TV. On top of the few seconds it takes for the TV to turn on, the software to launch an app, such as netflix or hulu, takes a while as well. If you want to access these services expect it to take a minute or two from power-on to launching the app. On the flip side, I was able to connect the TV to my network wirelessly and have never had any problems with the signal dropping or having to reconnect to the network.Some of the more nit-picky bits.-The buttons on the remote are small and the remote itself isn't backlit. I have managed to survive. There is a keyboard on the back of the remote making searches on netflix and amazon prime far easier.-Sound quality is not very good. I connected a pair of speakers to the television, quick, easy and cheap fix.-Not particularly stylish.

Crawford", "ReviewID": "RU87FZYBP8J83", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got the Vizio M3D470KD earlier this week and am pretty happy with it.  The minor quirks take it from a 5 star to a 4 star, but overall it is a very good TV.My item/my specifics:-47\" version (since sometimes Amazon groups products and reviews aren't clear)-Firmware version 2.36.8-Bought through 3rd party for $800 (since price affects our expectations)-Hooked up to external antenna, Sony Bluray player via HDMI and Nintendo Wii via component cables (no cable/satalite)-Subscriber of both Netflix and Amazon Prime as well as Youtube userPositive thoughts:-The picture looks great.  Now, to be fair, I'm not the best person to ask about this.  I'm upgrading from a 27\" tube TV purchased 15 years ago (when HDTV was still just a glimmer in her eye, so to speak).  Anything will look good next to that.  But I am an audiophile at heart and would like to think I've got the makings of a videophile and I had very high expectations.  So to that end, the black levels were good, but a bit brighter than I hoped.  The local dimming definitely seems to help and I didn't see any meaningful blooming.  The colors looked good and the overall image was sharp.  The motion smoothing did what it was supposed to, both good and bad.  The screen doesn't have a meaningful anti-glare coating, so in bright rooms it shows some glare, but personally, I prefer that (for my TVs, not my computer monitors) to the anti-glare coatings that give the speckled look to the image.  I watch most of my TV at night anyway.  It also seemed to handle the low-def content well.  The configurability of the display also allows for any correction one would like.  Mine looked pretty good right out of the box.-Speaking of which, for those concerned with the \"Soap Opera Effect\" (more properly called \"Smooth Motion Effect\" or \"Cinema Mode\"), it is correctable despite what some reviewers say.  There are both presets for the picture setting that can turn it off, or you can go into the advanced settings under the picture settings and control them more precisely.  Frankly, I kinda like that mode, but to each his own.-The volume of the sound is much better than I expected.  It gets plently loud.  Admittedly, the bass is pretty weak, but if you want quality sound, you should be hooking it up to a surround sound system.  For those who just want out of the box sound that works and is loud enough, this TV does well.  It also has both optical and line-out audio, so one could quickly get the bass they wanted with an external subwolfer (or hook it up to a more complete system).-The apps are good and a wide variety.  Netflix, Amazon, Youtube, Hulu, Vudu, Yahoo News, Finance and Weather, Flicker, Skype, Facebook, Twitter and more.  I haven't tried them all and am not sure I'd wait the time it takes theses apps to load (10-15 seconds) to check the weather when my smartphone can do it in 2 seconds, but the core apps worked well and are all the key ones.-4 HDMI inputs is very nice to have-The stand will work well for me because it's in two pieces that bolt together.  I'll be mounting it to a sliding drawer so that I can easily get behind it to change connections, etc. and the two piece stand allows me to directly bolt it to the drawer surface.  For those who care, it has the standard wall mount threaded screw holes.Negative thoughts (from worst to least important):-The remote's quality is a bit suspect.  I really like the design with the keyboard on the back and that it uses RF (so you don't have to point it at the TV) instead of IR.  But the squishy buttons with poor active feedback are very unclear on when they've been pushed and particularly when typing certain keys don't seem to respond and take multiple pushes.  Pushing very firmly, too firmly frankly, seems to resolve this issue.  It also is pretty light and has the feeling of being a bit flimsy (another reason I don't like pushing the buttons so firmly).  I won't be letting the kids \"test\" that, though.-Component/Composite video input are \"merged\".  Everyone has different components to attach, and I found the TV a little weak for attaching old devices.  There is just one set of plugs that can act as EITHER a component input (3 video + 2 audio cables) or a composite (1 video + 2 audio).  If you're thinking based on the specs that say it is compatible with both that it means there are separate connectors, you'd be wrong.  The only result for me is the old VCR won't get hooked up, which is no big deal, but worth mentioning for someone who may have multiple pre-HDMI items they want to connect.  You only get to connect one.  There are composite to HDMI up-converters for about $30 that would solve this or you could buy a composite switch box, but that's a bit of a pain.-The Amazon app doesn't appear to support the Watchlist.  The Watchlist is the closest thing Amazon Instant Video has to the Netflix Queue for free movies.  When you purchase a movie from Amazon Instant Video it goes in a special menu and they are easy to find.  But if you have Amazon Prime with all the available free movies, there used to be no way to select them on the computer for playing later on the TV/Streaming device.  Amazon added the Watchlist feature that solves this problem about a year ago and my Sony Bluray picked it up quickly.  The app in this Vizio TV does not have it.  Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.-The Gaming mode is a bit confusing, but once you figure it out, completely usable.  The issue is there are three places you can turn the gaming mode on (for those who don't know, gaming mode turns off all the various corrections (like motion blur correction) which reduces the lag between when the TV gets the signal to when it shows up on the screen).  The first is in the picture menu, where \"gaming\" is one of the preset choices.  This didn't seem to do anything.  The next is still in the picture menu, under advanced settings, where you can turn off all those corrections individually.  This too only 1/2 solved the problem.  The third place is in the settings menu, where you can turn game mode on, and this fully solved the lag problem.  That's a long way of saying gamers should change the setting in the settings menu not the picture menu.Overall, I'm very happy with the TV and the quirks mentioned above are minor compared to the quality of the TV overall and particularly at the price point I got it at.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Read This For an Straight-To-The-Point Review", "Author": "Sigfreed77", "ReviewID": "R3IUJ3K6HDLDG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Vizio M3D470KD is an awesome LED TV.

Maybe 20 - 30 hours of research across the entire web. First Im not completely sold on the Vizio brand, but it is a very popular brand. I went with it because of the rating/ features/ price point I wanted. The picture on this TV is very nice. I dont use 3D so I cant speak about that. The size is just right, and the 240 Hz refresh rate is perfect IMO. I love the sharpness and clarity. Many people dont like the soap opera effect but you can tune the TV to minimize that. I dont mind it, but it can definitely be a distraction. The sound is bad on this TV. I guess people expect to purchase a theater speaker system, so thats maybe not a shock. But the speakers seem very weak. Also the TVs software seems like junk to me. Its laggy to start up and change channels. Not unbearable but not crisp. The installed Apps are junk to me. I just bought a Roku box for $59 so I didnt have to deal with them anymore. The remote I dont like, so I bought a Logitech all in one harmony remote. That helped a lot. For the price I paid for this Im satisfied with my TV experience, but it has a significant amount of bugs and quirks that might turn off the sophisticated TV enthusiast. I also spent more than Id like for a 4 year aftermarket warranty. But I dont want a $700 14 month old paperweight. Ive been very lucky with electronics lasting forever in the past, but I dont want to push my luck.Feel free to ask me any questions!", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Green screen after ten minutes", "Author": "Keith Fitzgerald", "ReviewID": "RO9E6HA80WTU1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Returned it for a refund.

The 3D looks great.  It also uses only about one third the power of my old 40 inch Sony tube TV which should reduce my electric bill by about $2.00 per month.  But I do have some complaints:1. Before I bought this set I read a number of reviews at a number of tech sites.  Everyone complained about the remote being an uninspired bulky boxy thing.  Well, apparently they've \"upgraded\" the remote.  Now it's sleek.  I hate it.  It's physically small.  The buttons are too close together for my fingers.  They are also hard to pick out in a dark room.2. When you push a button on the remote it makes a nice click to let you know that you clicked it.  Unfortunately, clicking it is not enough:  you have to push it down hard beyond the click to reliably activate the button.  Really, really annoying.  I'll be replacing the remote with a universal.3. The set does have a set of six buttons (power, menu, volume +/-, channel +/-), but they are on the back-side of the right edge, which makes them inaccessible for me since I have the set recessed into a perfectly sized entertainment center.  Even if you can reach them, it's hard to tell which button your pushing since they are on the back.  All I really care about is the power button (so I can both start the TV boot process, and turn the TV off without looking for the remote).  I would much prefer the power button to be more easily accessible.4. Every A/V electronic device I've ever owned has always had a little green or red LED to let you know the power is on.  This set instead has a big light-up VIZIO label.  (Obnoxious marketing in my opinion.)  When the set is on, the VIZIO is lit brightly; when the set is off, the VIZIO is lit less brightly.  I've gotten better at differentiating between the two states, but I've more than once turned the set on thinking I was turning it off.  If you use HDMI inputs, the set can be configured to turn itself off if no signal is detected for 10 minutes, but this feature apparently does not work for either the coax or A/V inputs.  (Currently I'm not paying for HD cable service and my cable box has no high-def outputs.)5. I hooked up my cable box to the Vizio via A/V (Red, White, Yellow) connectors.  This worked fine until I turned on my microwave oven in the kitchen (probably 25 feet away from the set).  This resulted in horrible visual distortion (a wave that slowly scrolled up the screen) as well as a buzz on the audio.  I've had other TV sets hooked up in the same room with the same A/V cables while using the same microwave oven and not had problems.  I rather suspect the A/V input source is extremely susceptible to microwave noise.  Perhaps one could find shielded A/V cables to eliminate this problem.  I just switched from A/V to coax for the connection between my cable box and the TV avoid the issue.None of these flaws really bother me that much, and I'm still pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome deal and product!", "Author": "David Johnson", "ReviewID": "R8YX0MFJRYXUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw this opportunity on Thanksgiving Day.

I figured 3D and Internet Apps were a nice add-on. As I also own a smaller (27\") Vizio Razor LED and have always felt the picture quality was great, when I found this Vizio 47\" with it's top of the line specs, I was convinced I'd found a winner...but oh was I wrong!My biggest complaint is picture quality. As soon as I pluged the TV in, I knew I was in trouble. Colors were weak, contrast and brightness poor and blacks weren't black...more like fuzzy gray. But OK so it just needs a little tweaking right? Well I tried, made about every adjustment possible and even though I was able to improve the picture significantly, it was still nowhere close to the plasma I'm replacing. When displaying bright scenes the color was pretty good but in dark scenes where contrast is important, the picture was very unacceptable. Blacks as mentioned were weak, but there also was signicant edge lighting visible. Most darker scenes looked as if they had been filmed in fog. Strike One.Second major complaint is sound quality...my wife described it as she thought she was listening to AM radio, without the static. Again a little tweaking might help...nope. Strike Two.And the remote...actually really liked the QWERTY keyboard built into the back of it. Every smart TV should have this feature. But with that said the remote is unusually small. Reminds me of the cellphones they make with keys so small that no one over the age of 12 can use them. Strike Three.What about Vizio Internet Apps? They're OK but the interface should be easier to use (menu driven would be nice) and the lack of a browser and DLNA compatibility are two major short comings vs. the competition. And 3D? Actually never even tried it. Strike four?So today the UPS man came and hauled the Vizio away. Bought a Panasonic TC-L47DT50 instead. It has identical specs to the Vizio, much better Internet apps, DLNA compliance and a great 8 speaker sound system. And the picture quality out of the box was exceptional. True, the Panasonic costs more but delivers more of what I was looking for.Maybe I got a bad unit, maybe I'm spoiled by watching a plasma but I know you can do a lot better than this particular TV.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "SO disappointed that it is hard to put into words.", "Author": "fantasymandan", "ReviewID": "R19MFE0GP8A6W0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did not get the screws to the tv stand and did not get the remote!
