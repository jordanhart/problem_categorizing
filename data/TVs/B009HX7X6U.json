{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DEAD AFTER A MONTH", "Author": "James Leatherwood", "ReviewID": "R2UQJ3SRFFFVU2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for an exercise room, so it was used for about 2-3 hours, 5 days a week for about a month before it wouldn't power up. While the seller stated that this was a \u201cNEW\u201d TV, the box it came in was not only clearly labeled \u201cREFURBISHED\u201d, but it had at least 2 previous shipping addresses on it. When this TV did work, the picture was OK, but the audio was truly horrible \u2013 piercing highs with no lower mids or bass to speak of. The sound was so painful, my wife refused to use it. Since it was only used in a cursory capacity during my workouts, I figured that I could deal with the s***ty audio and the fact that it was a refurb. As stated, after just over a month of use it wouldn't power up. Of course, the TV died after the seller's return window, and I am currently waiting for a possible replacement from the manufacturer. (and another $26 lost on shipping). We'll see if the replacement is any better \u2026 provided I actually get it. Do yourself a favor, buy a Samsung, LG, Toshiba, or something  known to be reliable from a known/reputable seller \u2013 even it it costs substantially more. You may save yourself some considerable aggravation.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV!", "Author": "Isaac T. Spencer", "ReviewID": "R25FHENAYZ90M2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I was a bit hesitant in buying this tv at first, because It was not a well known brand. However it is quite the tv that comes with a warranty! For the price it is definitely worth the purchase and is one of the easiest to set up that I have come across so far. If your looking for a tv and not wanting to pay 500+ for it I STRONGLY recommend this one if you want something nice but are on a tighter budget. The only beef I really have with the tv is that the speakers could be a bit better, not that they are that bad but it would pry be  a good idea to get some speakers to hook to it in the future.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "The Seiki 24-inch LED TV set SE 241TS features a slim, compact look with an excellent picture.\nHeight, including the sturdy stand, is only 15.5 inches\nHD 1080p resolution makes images literally pop off the screen.\nThe screen-refresh rate is a speedy 60HZ\nA 1000:1 dynamic contrast ratio keeps images crisp", "Name": "Seiki 24'' CLASS - SE-241TS - 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ROmuyjTyL.jpg", "ProductID": "B009HX7X6U"}}
