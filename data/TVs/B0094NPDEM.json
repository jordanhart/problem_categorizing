I had been shopping around at all the electronic stores and online and this TV really grabbed my attention. The display model had the best color/picture, in my opinion, of all the other 32\" 720 TV's.  Bought this for a bedroom TV. If you are going for 720p vs a 1080 TV; this is a real bargain.  I am very happy with my purchase.  As mentioned in other reviews, it only has one button...but I can look past that.  Great price, great picture/colors for a 720p 32\" TV.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "32 Emerald series", "Author": "nonotnatto", "ReviewID": "R1GIWU7VGG0IW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "****Update: after comparing with a 32 inch 720 P Westinghouse UW edge lit series, I eventually chose the Westinghouse only because it was sharper for computer text and I use these TVs as computer monitors. You cannot adjust the sharpness setting when used in PC mode on the JVC, which is a dealbreaker for me because I like to make my sharpness a tad above average to make text look extra crisp. I can achieve this level of crispness with my Westinghouse, but unfortunately not with the JVC.The JVC does indeed do 444 on native resolution, but I really prefer to have the sharpening setting as well. It is the lack of the sharpness setting, I suspect, causing the JVC to be slightly more blurry for text compared to the Westinghouse. Or maybe it has to do with IPS versus VA panels,. The JVC definitely looks like a IPS, whereas my Westinghouse is definitely a VA panel.For everything else though, the JVC blows the Westinghouse out of the water. The colors, the viewing angles, the menu system, the sound, the ghosting, it's always better. So don't be misled by my update, unless you plan to use this as a computer monitor for heavy text reading.****Been using for one month on average eight hours a day. I like this TV. I use it as a PC monitor sitting 5 to 10 feet away at various times and the picture is very comfortable to look at. Yes there is 444 chroma subsampling if you use the 1366 or 1360 native resolution's. I got it hooked up to HDMI to my PC with a Radeon 7700 video card. Games like Guild wars two look great especially with the program called sweet FX which makes the colors look even better. I am comfortable reading webpages, although I do have a text-to-speech program that reads knows text while for me. The program is called \"text aloud\" for those who are curious. Keep in mind that you have to play with the settings to get computer text to look the best. I found that turning down the contrast and color helps.The contrast ratio is very very good. I got this TV at Costco for a good price and it's got the best contrast ratio and colors, with a 6.5 reported gray to gray response time by the manufacture. Colors are very vibrance. I play a lot of video games on this as well and bright colorful games look great. Dark games like doom three look great as well because of the deep blacks that can be achieved. There are six programmable picture modes that you can customize and reuse later. This is very convenient because I like to use custom color and brightness settings for my various games. Input lag is fine I play counter-strike on this thing.There is only one button on the TV and it's power on-off and input switching. But I checked the harmony remote database and this TV is supposedly compatible in case you lose the original remote.The sound lacks clarity and  bass. You can watch TV and understand spoken dialogue just fine, but don't expect this to be the oh my God amazing sound that they advertise. I think the higher-end models like the 42 inch probably have better sound, but this 32 definitely lacks good sound. If you are not a picky person about sound than the TV speakers will do just fine. It's fine for me and I watch shows and play games and listen to music on the built-in speakers.The TV is very light and the base is level and sturdy.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "No buttons, No VGA input, but great price and quality", "Author": "Etian \"videopix\"", "ReviewID": "RH049J1TPI5Q4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't misplace the remote, because the only button on the unit is on/off.

The picture and the viewing angles are great, and we couldn't be happier with that.  The TV with the stand mounted on it is lower profile than most 32\" models, which made it great for the location where we're using it.  The only negative is the sound, as mentioned for this and other 32\" models I've checked.  It started with a very hollow sound and not enough low-end, but either I'm getting used to it or the adjustments we have made are making that better.  For the price and the shorter height of the stand, it was a very good choice.  ...Just wish the sound was as good as on the little 26\" that used to sit here.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst TV I have used to date.", "Author": "Haoleb", "ReviewID": "R1HRCIDATFOE64", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this TV at costco, first impressions were... well not great. You pick it up and it honestly feels like one of those fake tv's that have nothing in them like a display model for a model home or something. I think the box it comes in weighs more than the actual tv. You might think this is a great change from those heavy CRT's or older generation LCD but weight is a pretty good indication of quality most times.This tv does not have any buttons on the actual television. You know its a pretty cheap tv when they cant even be bothered to include buttons.The main reason this is the worst tv I have ever used is because it is CONSTANTLY loosing channels. On a daily basis. I can be watching a standard cable channel (from the cable company not OTA) and it then suddenly thinks it is a digital channel, for example goes from displaying channel 69 and working fine to then displaying 69-0 and not working at all.... and picutre and sound will dissapear and it will display no signal. Until I go through and do a channel search to re-learn the channel again. Which works for any time between a matter of seconds to a day or two until it does it all over again.Like most modern tv's changing channels is excurciatingly slow..Steer clear of this one.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good T.V.", "Author": "ted cook", "ReviewID": "R1QLZKKSCPPH2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found this tv at BJ'S for $180.00.Very good tv for little money.Good color and sound.You cant go wrong with this one.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "JVC customer service is nonexistent", "Author": "Robin B.", "ReviewID": "R2PNYV3XQI43PL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I didn't purchase this television through amazon, but through a local store with a 90-day return policy.  30 days after the 90-day return period, the television started acting up.  This review goes more toward JVC's customer service than the television itself.  While the TV worked, it was fine.  However, if you have a problem, JVC makes it almost impossible to return.  They have to mail you a label, then you have to ship the television out of state (unless you live in California; I live in the 5th largest city in the U.S. and there is no JVC authorized service dealer).  In real time, you are talking about a month to fix your television.  When you call JVC, you are transferred to a special department that handles this television.  I think the department is staffed by two people for the entire country.  I have yet to be able to reach a supervisor, who is either \"not in the office yet\" or dealing with what they call other \"escalations\" (I think this refers to customers who are at the end of their rope).
