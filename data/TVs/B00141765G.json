I'm not a techno-file, but I think the picture is excellent.  Color is great and the HD feed from my satellite looks awesome.  The sound is a little lacking, but not enough for a four star rating. Games and Blu-Ray movies from my PS3 are almost unbelievable. It takes up a little more space than a plasma or LED, but the HUGE price savings make the little bit of lost space worth it. I would have paid 3X for a comparable plasma.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "get this now", "Author": "Gretel Foster-boatwright \"bargins only\"", "ReviewID": "R14MX3TCAKWIUI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is beautiful at an amzing price.

Haessly", "ReviewID": "RKV9G1TODUZKV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a big fan of DLP TVs since I discovered them - its just a lot of tv for the money, especially considering what you'd pay for a LCD or plasma of the same size. And no one does it better than Samsung. The picture is bright and razor sharp, and the color is great right out of the box, though there are a bevy of menu options if you want to tweak the settings to suit your particular preferences. This 61\" is an upgrade from the 46\" I've had for 3 years, and it is improved over the 46\" in the very few ways that needed any improvement; 3 HDMI inputs over 2, menus are even easier to navigate, there are a few more automatic color options, etc...And these TVs are almost all screen, which means it doesn't just seem big because of the speaker panels and bevels surrounding the screen, it really is huge! When you sit in front of this thing, you feel like you're sitting in front of a movie screen!To say I would recommend this TV is an understatement - you will not be disappointed!", "Date": "February 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "great picture and sound", "Author": "Kevin T.

Wise I had gotten the 67 inch just so that I could have more picture. Great set for the price.Updated 10/29/2012:  Still working without a hitch.

When my tv didnt arrive at the date it was suppose I called. then this when the fun began fist a woman gets on the phone and tells me that they no longer have the tv in stock and wouldnt know when they would get them in, which made me very upset. Then she said they would give me a 65 inch mitibishi in place of the 61 Inch so i said ok then i asked would i Get the 450 dollers back for the extra shipping since my original tv never came, she said yes , and that she wanted to call back the next day to conform it, i said ok.  I called back the next day then this A## hole got on the phone talking about he didint no anything about that and that me tracking number was wrong and he didnt know about my purchase.  So this is when I really started to get angry and was about to curse him out when his supervisor got on the phone and told me he new what happened and that my tv would take another week but i woulnt get the money i paid for expedied shipping back so at this point I lost money, didnt get my tv, at the right date and time, and i never got the tv a shopped online for, then I had to deal with elextronic expos Sh@it, man they really pissed me off.  They have the worse costumer service i have ever experienced with.
