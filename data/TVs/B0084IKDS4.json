The picture was fuzzy and not clear at all. I hooked it up using a VGA cable at the same resolution (1920 x 1080 or 1080p) and got much better quality. It confused me because I thought the digital signal would be better than analog, but it works!", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "pretty good", "Author": "Frank.L", "ReviewID": "RKEHCHRG1UR4P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The thing I like most about this TV is that it has a lot of inputs for its size.  There's no DVI input of any sort in here, but there ARE 3 hdmi ports, a coaxial, a usb port, an AV input AND separate Component input, AND a VGA port, AND both input and output stereo jacks (the standard ones on pretty much all mp3 players--I'm not sure what they're called).The sound on this TV is atrocious, and yes, I have heard much better sound quality on smaller LED HDTV's--namely, my 21.5\" Samsung 120Hz LED HDTV. Even my Samsung's sound quality is only acceptable for me, given that sound for small TV sets generally sound horrible, but especially when I compare it to this Sceptre TV.  However, I'm not too bothered about sound quality here, since I can hook it up to much better sound systems.In any case, the picture quality on this Sceptre is pretty good in my opinion, which brings me to the second major flaw of this TV.  The second major flaw (second to the sound quality of this set) is that....you absolutely can not dim the backlight for this TV.  No matter how I much I explored its menu, I just couldn't find its backlight dimming/brightness increasing capability. There's one option in the menu, which is \"brightness\" under the \"picture\" option, but all it did was control how much extra \"whiteness\" it added to the picture. Which reminds me, this Sceptre's menu is really quite bad and confusing...but it is still navigable.  Just, you will have to take a longer time learning it.  Anyway, I called customer support, but after 10 or so minutes, they concluded that the E243BV was not backlight-adjustable.  Obviously, I wasn't very happy, but I couldn't do anything about it, either.Other than that setback, I actually think the picture quality is not bad, despite some reviews saying the colors look washed out.  I'm no expert when it comes to any display technology's picture quality, but I find that if you're looking for \"richer colors\", just set the \"brightness\" to 0 and the \"contrast\" and \"color\" to whatever you want it to be.  When brightness is set to 0, the colors look pretty good and don't really look washed out to me.  One last thing that kind of dings the TV a little, but isn't a major problem, is that the power cable is actually part of the TV, so you can't take it out and replace it.Anyway, my favorite thing about this TV is that it has so many inputs for its size, which is why I ultimately gave it a 4 star rating (after weighing it with the acceptable picture quality, very poor sound quality, and absence of backlight-adjusting capability).5/3/2013 UPDATE:I bought this TV set when it was a little under $130 total.  Sure, my review was favorable, but that was because I assumed this TV would continue to be around the price it was when I bought it (if not, slightly more expensive) when I wrote my review.  Now, this TV set seems to range from $190-$200.  In this case, I would really recommend some other brands like Samsung, LG, or Vizio, rather than Sceptre, because $190-200 seems pretty overpriced for the overall quality to me; whereas Samsung, Vizio, and LG's overall quality is pretty good for their typical price.  My suggestion would be to buy this TV set when it's around $140-150 or lower.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap TN panel = viewing angle is limited", "Author": "Yiqun Li", "ReviewID": "R1XIWC49LBCD6X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is good as a monitor or if most time you are face to face towards it.

This problem has since been remedied by a pair of Logi Tech external speaker for about 20 dollars. However, this little TV has a pretty decent picture and great color contrast. I get over the air HDTV for the local channels and we have a Roku XD, which can stream full 1080p into this TV. Both sources worked great and look great. For one and a half clams, this was not a bad bargain. I recommend it as a secondary or tertiary unit, but probably not as a primary unit.
