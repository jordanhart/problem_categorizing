Movies look clearer than when viewed on a large screen in a movie theater. Sporting events are a pleasure to watch because of the clarity of the picture.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Sony LCD next to XBR line!!!", "Author": "Brian Morales \"mazda3turbo\"", "ReviewID": "R3RVZOZXPCCO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay first off let me start by saying i've had a 32 inch Bravia (i dropped it during a move), a 65 inch projection Sony tv (which lasted 8 years), a 34 inch Sony Trinitron HDTV (which i gave to my in-laws), a 46 inch Sony XBR9 HDTV ( I still have it and looks spectacular) and now this 55 inch Sony HX701 LCD tv. So theres my history with this brand. yeah i've had other brands growing up, but it never gave me the satisfaction Sony has. Now to the review of this set. I did high amounts of research considering this was going to be in the main living room. What can I say but this tv is amazing, internet features are great and on point, the sound is decent (the speakers are on the bottom, but because most LCD's are meant to be mounted on the wall), the design of it is really high end with a thick bezel and the Sony logo lights up. This set has 240hz which u can change from being turned off to 120hz and up to the 240hz. The best part is that it has The Bravia Engine 3 which is Sony's highest color processor. When I first received this tv nothing looked great and the motionflow wasn't on, so i messed with it a little and BOOM!!!! perfect picture. If u dont have a HD Receiver for your regular cable then ofcourse your not gonna get clear picture no matter what tv you have. You will have to adjust the picture and speaker settings for each device you connect to your tv (which i highly recommend). Theres a lot features with this set, which are too many to list so just google it. Just remember if your looking for a tv replacement or just want something high end go with LCD. For those who dont know the difference just remember this, DLP Projection was great (but only for dark rooms), LED is supposed to be the best, but what happens when one or two or ten little diodes go out. It costs a lot to replace LED tv's. LCD has been around a long time, cameras, camcorders, cell phones, calculators, and even old game systems (gameboy, Gamegear) have been using LCD technology. oh yeah and plasma I wont even talk about.I gave it five stars because These Sony products never seem to dissapoint. If you have any specific questions I'll be glad to help.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Reflective screen", "Author": "Davis", "ReviewID": "R2QQQ9H3H4YRUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The colors keep up with the picture unlike other models. Has nice depth. Works great with the computer as a monitor. But problems when plugged directly into router. Internet TV choppy and too irritating to watch. Will not download new software. Ask Sony over a month ago to send. Still waiting! The screen is too reflective but OK at night.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Sony KDL-55HX701 55\" Bravia LCD HDTV 240Hz 1080p", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21fILcrGdfL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003Y7T7QY"}}
