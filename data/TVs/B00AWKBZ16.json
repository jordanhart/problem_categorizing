{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Brilliant picture and 3D", "Author": "Faisal Yaqoob", "ReviewID": "RJP0JE5EY8YXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally like Plasmas for their better picture quality (I already own 5 HD TVs and this is the 6th one). The only reason I decided to go with LED TV was there's no 70\" Plasma in the Market. And my 60\" looks too small in my great room - possibly because of high ceilings. After researching Sharp's 70\" TV I decided to wait for Panasonic to come up with a 70\" Plasma, but then Sony came out with this. It was decently priced, had 3D, there were no reviews. But I decided to take a chance - given Sony's reputation. I must say I am not disappointed!The GOOD:Overall Picture Quality:Overall picture quality is good. I would say it is awesome given that it is not a Plasma yet Sony was able to produce brilliant blacks.720p Quality:Picture was not pixelated with 720p output from my Verizon box. I was able to see bigger picture without any quality degradation due to bigger size. It was really surprising. The picture was at least as good as on my 60\" Plasma on 720p.1080p Quality:I put in Avatar bluray movie and played it. I turned off all the lights to see how darks appear. Even with factory settings the result was amazing. After looking at the picture quality of this TV I can no longer argue with my friends that Plasma is superior than LED.3D:This TV uses passive 3D!!! And this was a pleasant surprise. I like passive 3D better than active 3D for two reasons.1. In passive 3D TV produces two images at a time, while each lens in your polarized 3D glasses can see only one image which feeds different images to both eyes - resulting in 3D image in your brain. I like it because instead of glasses completely blinding your each eye one after the other some 240 times a second (active 3D), your both eyes just see different images - which I have found to put less stress on your eyes and brain.2. Passive 3D glasses are cheap - these are the same one used in theaters. You can order around a dozen for less than 25 bucks. And they don't need to be recharged and they are light in weight. Compare that to an active 3D glass where each cost a minimum of 50 bucks and you have to recharge them and they are not as lightweight as passive.3D Quality:Again, I restarted Avatar in 3D mode and the result was just WOW!!! My three year old daughter when walked across the TV I almost screamed that she is going to bump in the guy - but wait - the guy was in the movie. I am not kidding it happened a few times - that is when I noticed that 3D is just amazing - and it does have a pop-out effect usually experienced only in theaters. May be the screen size helped in producing life sized images.Now the BAD:Menu's are not intuitive and has a slow response time. But I wouldn't have given it 4 stars just for this reason. The reason I gave it four stars is that when changing resolution (i.e. when PlayStation goes from playing bluray video to home screen and back) the screen goes blank and TV stops responding to commands. I could still hear the sound but no picture. I have to turn it off and back on and I start to see the picture. This is most likely a manufacturing defect. I still have to contact Sony about it (as I just got TV last night). Will update the review when I have this resolved.Tip:I had my PlayStation connected with an old HDMI cable which worked fine with my old TV. When I connected PlayStation to the new TV with the same cable I was able to see the menus and stuff. However when I try to play a 3D movie the picture would go blank and I would hear sound after long pauses. I remembered reading somewhere that 3D requires newer faster HDMI cables. I had some newer HDMI cables in my stash. So when I changed it everything started working. So if you are unable to play 3D movies try a newer (I think ver 1.4 is required but I am not sure - just google it) HDMI cable.EDIT 5/7/2013:My issue above was resolved by a call to tech support. I had to unplug both TV and Playstation while they were \"on\". Then disconnect the HDMI cable, wait for one minute and then plug TV and Playstation back in. Connect the HDMI cable. This resolved the issue above - so I updated my rating to 5 star!", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony - the one and only - It's a great TV, with some caveats", "Author": "Jonathan C. Cauthorn", "ReviewID": "R2T5RC07GAU2R4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "See the pics I posted!It's a great TV, for a good price. I like the remote, but it could have been better.What I like:1. It's a Sony.There's something special about using Sony equipment, especially when you use a lot of their stuff, they work well together.2. Bravia Sync:This Bravia sync is cool, and it was unexpected - I can actually control my PS3 with the TV remote - yeah, that rocks. So I can put a blu-ray disk in the PS3, and use the TV remote to pause, play, select options and all that. I've got some other Sony stuff I have to hook up now to see how that single remote works with it. That's just cool.3. Great Picture:It looks great. Ok, so I'm coming from a Sony 32\" picture tube that isn't properly aligned anymore, but I've taken my time looking at TVs in the stores.4. The Netflix button:There's a NetFlix button on the remote. I know, that's not really a big deal, and I know my way around a remote, but it's a cool feature. It's nice that Netflix looks so good on the screen too. Considering my internet speed is just high enough to work most of the time without pauses on NetFlix, the picture is fantastic.5. Great 3D:The 3D is very good. I have only tried The Hobbit 3D so far, but my goodness it's smooth and lifelike. I'm looking forward to playing with the controls on 3D tweaks. I've been saving my 3D glasses from theaters for over a year now so I have plenty of glasses for a house full of guests. The Real-3D glasses work great. So do the included Sony 3D glasses.6. Keyboard and Mouse support via USB:You can plug in a USB Keyboard and mouse, or a wireless keyboard and mouse, and that does work.7. The TV is software up-gradable:Granted, I found this out when I first went to set it up and found that there was a newer version already so I updated it. It's nice to know that they have the ability to add or fix features (and most likely give the NSA more information about your viewing habits).8. I particularly like the feel of the remote:The back of the remote is not slippery or sticky - it's a perfect balance in between. It has horizontal and vertical lines running the length and width of the remote. These seem to help you grip it better without being sticky.What I don't like or found irritating:1. Noticeable lines in 3D when you are too close:When I first put on the 3D glasses I was (apparently) too close to the TV and noticed the lines. Ug. That was irritating. When I went back to the couch, the lines disappeared or blended together and I didn't notice it again. I have a Sony PS3 monitor with the Active Glasses so I know what full 1080p 3D looks like. As far as I can tell so far, when I'm sitting across the (not terribly large) room, there doesn't seem to be much difference.2. The Remote control is IR only:The Remote Control is IR only. Really. I thought it would make much more sense to go to bluetooth or wifi or something. I'm used to the bluetooth remote on the PS3 and it doesn't matter where you point it. Well, unless you point the IR in the general direction of the fire alarm which uses IR to put it in \"test\" mode which scares the cat and dogs and causes my son to get upset that I set it off ---again---.3. The Remote control has no keyboard:When I was looking at TVs I was particularly enamored with the Vizio remote - it's bluetooth and it has a FULL KEYBOARD on it! So, here I get this Sony TV which has no keyboard or even a simplified way to enter letters. Even the LG (or Toshiba? one of them) has a \"magic remote\" that works like a pointer device (like a mouse). So I was really disappointed that Sony didn't have something more advanced for this.4. No Skype:No Skype on this model. Granted, it's one less way for the NSA to monitor me, but the option would be nice Maybe with a software upgrade Sony? Or Other IM/video chat app like Google? Please?5. Keyboard and Mouse only work in Browser:When you plug in the wireless keyboard/mouse, they only work on the Opera Browser. Really Sony? Why? Why can't I use it for searching in other apps like Hulu & Netflix? Please unlock the keyboard and mouse and set them free!About my experience so far:I've had this KDL-60R550A for a week and only had it setup for a couple days. I got it from buy dig which had the best price at the time and now Amazon appears to be matching it but always shop around first so you know.I'll try to add stuff as I discover it.(Shameless plug) Did that help you?", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Minor flashlighting, slow to connect wifi - otherwise, great!", "Author": "dmron", "ReviewID": "R3FQUINCCJCP7N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the 70\" version of this TV a few weeks back for my new home theater setup. Despite a couple major flaws, overall I am quite happy. Blu-ray movies are stunning. Sitting about 10 feet from the screen, I almost feel like I'm in a theater. Netflix and Amazon video are pretty good too, although since they're not as high bitrate as a blu-ray, you can definitely see some compression artifacts.This is the first TV I've ordered from Amazon and I was a little scared honestly, but having people bring the TV into your house and set it up for you is quite handy to say the least. They don't plug in all your devices, but they put it on the stand, make sure it works, and will help you place it on your media center table.Pros:- Excellent image quality.- Screen lag is minimal, in regards to video games. I haven't had to use \"game mode\", the default seems fine.- Menus are nice and speedy. Some people have said they're are laggy but I don't find that to be the case at all. Of the 3 smart TV's I've owned (the others being LG and Vizio), this one is by far the best when it comes to nagigating menus.- Fairly good/simple remote. I much prefer the LG Magic Remote but since most remotes are horrible these days, this one is good relative to the average remote.- Lots of built in video apps - I only need Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube, but there's plenty more to be had.- Tons of inputs - I don't need them for my setup as my receiver does HDMI switching for me, but it's still nice to have so many built in.- Passive 3D is a big pro in my opinion. Lighter glasses, less headaches, and no worrying about batteries, what's not to like?- Relatively thin bezel for the screen size, which makes the TV look attractive (except the chrome stand...sigh)- The viewing angle seems good to me. I see *some* dimming when going more than about 30 degrees, but not as bad as some people seem to be saying. For my setup, this point is moot, as the room is fairly narrow. And who wants to watch a TV at more than 30 degrees off center anyways?Cons:- It takes a few minutes for it to connect to the internet when you first turn it on. This is *super* annoying and a few times I have just went ahead and turned on my PS3 and started up Netflix that way. The point of having \"apps\" on your TV is so you don't have to use other devices for some functionality, so this is just dumb.- My screen has the flashlight effect in 3 of the corners. Not nearly as bad as a lot of the pictures I've seen around the web, but still noticeable sometimes. I don't notice it at all when playing video games. I rarely notice when watching movies. Only when the screen is almost entirely black, which isn't that often. I mainly only see it when switching inputs on my receiver. It does annoy me, but if you want a TV this big, it's pretty much impossible to get no flashlighting so you have to be willing to live with some degree of it.- Weak wifi signal - My PS3 had no problems streaming Netflix in HD, but my TV could barely even connect to the router when I first got it (in the same room as the PS3). I had to get a wifi extender for it to get a good signal. And that's fine anyways, as I like having a stronger signal everywhere throughout the house. So if you're going to use wifi with this thing, make sure your router is not more than one or two rooms away, unless you have an extender.- The energy saver stuff is ridiculously bad, but at least you can turn it off. Do so immediately or the screen will shut off entirely any time the screen turns 100% black and it won't come back on unless you power cycle the TV. I can't believe this passed QA!- The screen is fairly reflective. Mine is in a dark room so it doesn't affect me, but if you have windows behind your couches/chairs, you will definitely see reflections.- I mentioned the menus are speedy before, but the *settings* menus are a bit confusing and poorly organized.I have to drop half a star for both flashlighting and the time spent waiting for wifi after turning it on. Those are the only two major flaws for me. This TV is quite new so I'm sure a firmware update will fix the wifi issue in the future, at which point I would revise my rating to 4.5 stars. But since I can't give half a star, it will remain a 4-star rating even if that gets fixed.** UPDATE, 2013-10-22 **So it's been a few months. Amazingly, the flashlighting just went away on its own after a month or so. One corner still has it *barely* and I only see it when the screen is 100% black, but it's completely gone from the rest of the screen. I didn't know such a thing could occur.Also, a firmware update must have fixed the wifi issue as it now connects much faster. Still not quite as fast as I'd like, but generally within 20 seconds it's connected.These were my only two major complaints with the TV and since they're both fixed, I'm revising to 5 stars.

That being said I am very happy with the purchase. I will keep it simple with a good/bad list.The bad,1. Start up screen/ black screen seems to have shades of light (some describe as pizza effect from actual screen glass).2. Sometimes glitchy in the apps. Netflix sometimes locks up and YouTube sometimes just shuts down, and it's had 3-4 software updates that I'm aware of.3. If you are going to be viewing this tv from a close range this probably isn't the one for you. That being said up close is not where it shines.4. Blacks aren't as dark as I would like, but it's an led so it's expected.5. Not too impressed with the 3d. Seems like the further away you are from the tv the better it gets, but maybe it's just me?6. Remote is nothing special, but it gets the job done.7. Can't change any tv settings when you are in an app.What I like about it,1. Has an awesome color/ picture when viewed 5-6 feet away.2. Sound is better than expected.3. Love the wifi- apps. Use them more than expected.4. Has a WOW factor from a viewing standpoint, and not some crazy design like some tv's this size. Get complements on it a lot.5. Is a very practical smart tv. You do not need a PhD to operate the wifi or app features or remote.6. Sony support was great when I called with a few questions.Over all this has been a great fit for me. I know they say bigger is better, but if you have a smaller room and plan on getting a 70\"+ tv you probably need to get a 4k for the up close viewing.

When I first switch \"On\"  this TV, I was so disappointed and remembering my previous TV and how good it was. Colors and picture was not looking good on this new TV. I was playing with settings, that's it. TV start displaying solid/vibrant colors and amazing picture. This TV really need settings adjustment to make you happy on your purchase.  I am listing my settings below, hoping it might be help you on fine tuning your TV.Sony advertised this TV give a Theatre like 3D, yes..  believe me, 3D is amazing on this TV. I also have 46 inch Sony NX711 3D TV which is active 3d model, but I like the 3D on R550A. This TV comes with 4 pair of Sony passive 3D glasses.  I purchased additional 4 pairs for each $9.99.I am using Sony sound bar Sony HT-CT660 as external sound for my TV.  Sony HT-CT660 will take 3 HDMI inputs and it has one HDMI out.  You have to connect Sound bar's HDMI out to TV's ARC HDMI port.  On back of TV, you will see HDMI 1 port have ARC (Audio Return Channel).  If you connected to HDMI ARC, you do not need a separate audio out cable from TV to connect your home theatre systems.  HDMI ARC will send the audio to your home theater through HDMI cable while video is playing on TV. This is useful when you are watching the YouTube or Netflix etc. on TV using built in Wi-Fi feature.Connected to Wi-Fi and it is fast enough to view Netflix, Youtube and other internet apps.This TV also has the web browser, so you can browse the websites. I tried to browse the [...] the entire website's home page displayed on the TV screen. Looks beautiful. The only issue I felt, it is not easy to click the links on the website using remote. I think wireless keyboard and mouse might be help on browsing the site, but I didn't tried. I am happy with my laptop to browse the sites.  I want to use my TV to watch the video content, but not for browsing sites.One of the feature on this TV is \"Screen Mirroring\".  If you have Sony cell phone or Sony tablet, you can mirror the phone and tablet's content to TV using wireless connection.  I have iphone and ipad, so I am not depending on this feature. I always use Apple TV (Apple TV MD199LL/A ) to mirror my ipad on TV screen.  The good thing about Apple TV is, it works with any TV equipped with HDMI port. So I am good here.I rated this TV as 4 stars due to one reason. Side view is not good on this TV. If your room is not wider, probably you might not noticed the side angle issues.  I noticed, if I move away from TV screen to more than 30 degrees left or right, picture looks with faded colors. I was reading somewhere, this TV is not suitable for wall mount due to side angle issues. Anyways, I mounted to wall and I liked it on the wall.I would like to give 5 out 5 for this TV, but due to side angle view issues, my overall rating is 4 stars.The settings I am listing here will improve the picture quality and minimize the side angle view issues.Picture Mode: CustomBacklight: 5Picture: 85Brightness: 40Color: 58Hue: G2Sharpness: 15Color Temperature: WarmNoise Reduction:  MediumMPEG Noise Reduction:  MediumMotionflow: OffCineMotion: Auto 1Advance Settings: Off (All settings are Off; Gamma is 0)Eco Settings: Off  (All settings under Eco, Off)", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "In a word...WOW", "Author": "Matthew Herrera", "ReviewID": "R1ZFC6C3UE1HBO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have literally been buying a new TV on average every year and a half or so.

More over 3D experience is surprisingly awesome. Read on for my experience.I spent lot of time in comparing TVs and looking in best buy & reading reviews but I never liked any med range TVs. I looked at 2013 Samsung (series 6 & 7) F6400, F7100 and LG 47LA7400 / 47LA6900 but all of them had issues. LG  has not so accurate colors and light bleeding from corner. In Best Buy showroom I was able to find light bleeding/clouding from the corners. Samsung on the other hand screen brightness uniformity issues and their smart TV interface is not user friendly. Worried if I bring home any of these then in dark room more issues may pop up.But when I looked this R550A, I felt like this is it. First one glance changed my mind away towards it. That's SONY for you. I am so confident that I didn't take any extra warranty on it. Only other TV that comes close / beats is from SHARP but they are expensive.Pros/The Good:- Great brightness (turn off the energy saving and auto light settings for more brighter picture)- Very good screen uniformity from Edge to Edge and no light bleeding. - Excellent picture from Blu-Ray and from streaming services like Netflix, youtube and others.- ABOVE ALL - The best 3D experience I ever had. Pictures pop out straight out of the box (watched Avatar and sample videos from Sony Entertainment streaming services). I previously watched 3D at Best Buy on a Samsung, LG and Panasonic and I was never impressed this much. No flicker or crosstalk and I even set the 3D depth to high and no issues. Plus Polarized glasses - no battery.- Motionflow XR 240 does work great. If source video is Full HD I prefer to keep Motionflow off or to medium and MPEG and Digital Noise reduction to medium since you already know the video from source is excellent and this should not be processed further else SOP opera effect. But want to let you know that you have all optional settings to tweak best or poor video quality signals accordingly.- Decent SD quality video up scaling to HD. Keep Motionflow XR 240 to High herr and other MPEG and Noise reduction to high/Med which will smoothen out videos.- Excellent sound - it will not balst but all sounds are distinctly heard and loud enough (no bass though).- Has all the connectivity options - MHL, good Wi-Fi, Miracast, smartphone on TV, Ethernet etc...- Very good Sony Entertainment Network streaming services.Cons:- Wish Sony gave X-Reality PRO engine here since this is supposed to be med range TV.- No game mode. I have Wii U and never faced any problems though. Looks like with MotionFlow 240, a separate game mode is not required. So Sony might have removed it.- There are no advanced picture settings once you enter the Sony Streaming services. But this is not a problem for me since I use blu-ray player for streaming services in which case I can make all settings for Pictures while streaming.Just to let you guys know: 3D is so good that I returned Samsung Blu-Ray player and brought SONY Blu-Ray player thinking it will have even more 3D effect.Again this Sony product may not look futuristic like Samsung or LG, futuristic remotes (touch/motion remote etc) but it beats easily 2013 Samsung series 6 & 7 and LG 6* & 7* in picture quality, 3D depth perception, Setting options, simple easy to use remote (nice tactile feedback and spacing between keys) and Excellent SONY reputation and build quality.

I love the depth, color, contrast - just overall a really nice picture once properly calibrated.I was concerned originally because of the clouding on black scenes that is inherent to LCD and that issue was obvious on this tv in my VERY dark room.  But I learned a few things.  First was to loosen the 8 screws at the corners of the frame.  Didn't seem to make a difference.  Then I massaged the screen with a microfiber towel while it was on.  This made the most dramatic improvement.  It spread out the clouding, making it almost unnoticeable.  Then I was instructed to let some light in the room - don't watch it in a cave.  And reduce the backlighting a bit.  Now I don't believe I can see ANY clouding.The apps on the tv itself run fine enough, if not great, but I use the PS3 99.9% of the time for that anyhow. All inputs are run through a Darbee and look great to awesome.  I highly recommend a Darbee for any big display.I had a Vizio E series for a month and hated it.  The picture was nice, but the apps were sluggish.  The wifi unusable and the LED edge lighting looked horrible.  The audio never matched the image - always out of time.  The tv would freeze up, make a loud \"pop\" and shut off.  It was worth the extra money to buy this Sony.  No regrets.  I cannot see any edge lighting \"dots\" on the Sony.I did like the way Vizio has their jacks to plug in parallel to the back of the tv where the Sony has them come in at a 90.  That could make it a little difficult for those of you that want the tv snug against the wall.  Mine is on a full-motion mount and so I have plenty of room, but some tilt-only mounts may make it a bit tight for cabling sticking straight out the back.  That's just a stupid design Sony!  I can't comment on the stand that comes with it as mine is wall mounted.  I would have liked one more analog audio in, but no display EVER gives you all the ports you want.I never thought I'd care for 3D, but have found that I actually do like it.  The tv's simulated 3D for 2D sources brings out alot of detail that would otherwise go unnoticed.  I love that this tv is passive 3D = cheap glasses.Gaming has been awesome.  I don't play on-line so can't comment about any lag with multi-player games.  I've noticed no lag playing campaign mode.  Oh, and 3D gaming is AWESOME!  Audio ALWAYS matches the video on every source I put to it.  It never needs adjusting.I like the somewhat matte screen.  Cannot stand the mirror screens of Samsung.  I hate seeing reflections in my tv and a 70 inch is an awful lot of flat area to pick up every little light in the room.  No issues here.Flat screens never have enough sound for me so you really should do something extra for the sound.  I tried soundbars over the years and hate them.  I never want an HT set up in my bedroom (where this tv is) so years ago I just added some remote speakers with their own amps to the nightstands of the bed.  I ran 3.5mm stereo cables to 'em and the sound is perfect for what I wanted.  The tv has a 3.5mm audio out - perfect.The menus are a little convoluted but with enough time, you learn your way around them fast enough.  I don't use motion flow control as I HATE soap opera effect.  Most if not all PQ fake effects are set to \"off\".No freakish behavior from this tv at all.  I don't give it 5 stars simply because it has the clouding that I had to deal with.  Even if that is normal for LCD, doesn't mean I gotta like it.  The 50 inch Panny plasma that this is replacing had ZERO issues to overcome except for being too small after 5 years and producing alot of heat as plasmas do.  Only an issue because I live in the desert.  Anyhow, LCD has some shortcomings that I do not feel plasmas have so I doubt I would ever give any LCD 5 stars.  And you can believe all the trash talk about plasmas if you want, but I never experienced any problems.  I switched to LCD simply because of the heat, prices and choices in 70+ inch displays.Anyhow, so glad I didn't decide to exchange this set. It would have been over the very minor clouding, but I think that has been managed now. It's been a month with this tv and now I can finally breakdown and store the box away in the garage. She's a keeper!Time to enjoy it......BTW, at the time I placed the Amazon order it was $2199 delivered and came with a promotional:*Year of Netflix,*Year of Hulu Plus,*30 days of Sony Music Unlimited (junk) and*2% cashback rewards good on Amazon.NOTE:  Amazon delivery does not help you set it up, mount it or put it on the stand - NOTHING.  Pilot sends ONE guy with a dolly.  You help him carry it in and unbox it.  He plugs it in to make sure the screen comes on and that's it.  Amazon would have you to believe that their delivery of big tvs is something special.  From the 3 I've had delivered, not so.

The TV is mounted on the wall and is just flat out gorgeous to look at style wise.  I have it connected to a Yamaha RX-v475 A/V receiver and it works without any problems.Now the good:Size: 70\" is just a phenomenal viewing size.  It's like having your own home theater (which given how this bad boy sits on my wall, it certainly feels that way) without having to spend $$ on the the actual movie theater!Controls: Fairly intuitive controls.  The on-screen menu is straight forward although I'm not sure why Sony decided to have 2 separate menus.  Menus respond nicely and without any lag.  There's a dedicated Netflix button, but I don't use it as I don't subscribe to Netflix.  But it works as advertised should you have a Netflix membership.  Can't speak on the Smart TV piece as I rarely use those functions - this TV serves primarily as the spot to watch movies or play video games.Picture: This is a bit of a mixed bag.  Live TV looks like absolute crap.  There's just no sugar coating it - live TV, when compared to a 50\" Panasonic Plasma we have in the living room, looks atrocious.  Now part of that has to do with the fairly significant bump in screen area, but it also rams home just how crappy broadcast TV is, even the HD channels.  And understand that all HD channels are not created equal.  NBC and CBS in HD look great, Fox - not so much.  ABC is hit or miss depending on what you're watching.  TNT looks downright awful (ruining my basketball watching experience!).  Which brings me to sports - there is definitely noticeable distortion on the screen for fast moving objects.  Messing with the settings helps but doesn't completely rid you of it.  That being said, had a ton of people over to watch the Superbowl on this thing and it was still a great experience.On the flip side, watching movies on this thing is simply incredible.  I have never been so impressed with a Bluray movie in my life until watching it on this TV.  The vibrant colors, the smooth motion, the true 1080p resolution - I thew in the Avengers Bluray and jumped to the scene where the Hulk is bringing down one of those really big and armored aliens, and my buddy who had helped me put it up just sat on the couch in stunned silence at how gorgeous it looked.3D: I honestly didn't realize that this TV was 3D as I felt that 3D TVs were nothing but a gimmick.  Now, this TV uses passive 3D which means you get to wear the more simple glasses like the ones you find at the movies.  I bought a 3D movie just to try the feature out (watching it via my PS3) and my goodness, I was floored.  For me, this will be the only way I watch movies on this TV from now on! The passive 3D is just amazing - I didn't experience any cross-talk, ghosting, or any of the other issues you typically find people mentioning in user forums.  It just works.  Watching the Man of Steel 3D Bluray was unbelievable.  I had other people watch some scenes of bluray movies in 3D and they were just as impressed as I was.  I don't think 3D will catch on for live programming, but for movies? It is an absolute difference maker.Inputs: You get plenty of them.  4 HDMI inputs but I'm only using 2 (one of which is simply a backup).  Granted, I have the TV hooked up to an A/V receiver, but it's nice to know that if you don't have one, you still have a decent number of inputs.Built-in WiFi: The TV comes with a wireless adapter built-in, meaning you can connect it to your wireless router and have it connected to the internet.  The TV was able to connect to my router with no issues and has a very strong connection.  This is key as you can opt to have the TV download software updates automatically, which is nice as there have been 3 updates downloaded to the TV since I purchased it.Video Games/Lag: There has been absolutely no discernible lag that I've experienced when playing video games.  This includes fast twitch games like CoD and Assassin's Creed to other genres like RPGs and sports.  If you want a big gaming TV, this one will definitely fit the bill.The bad:LED: For all the benefits, there are still some annoying things you have to deal with.  In very dark scenes, there can be \"blotches\" on the screen - which is apparently normal for LED TVs - but not if you weren't expecting it.  This was more noticeable out of the box but has gotten considerably better since then, but when compared to plasmas, there's just no excuse for this on a TV at this price.  Thankfully, mine weren't bad enough that a return was needed, but you shouldn't be surprised if you see some when you power this thing up.Picture Controls: There really aren't many adjustments you can make to the picture on this thing.  Can you find a set that works? Yes, but it would've been nice if Sony added more controls in this regard.Mounting: If you're going to mount this on the wall, just know that near the center of the base of the TV will possible make for problems.  That's where the stand that comes with the TV would go, but in my case I had a wall mount that was very flush with the wall, which led to problems in secure the TV to the actual mount.  Just thought that was a bit odd.All in all, this TV was a great buy for the price.

Even with the Clouding and light leakage (common to edge lit LED TV's but only a problem with black/blank screens)) we still had our hearts set on a new LG TV.Now to our new Sony TV:  We were surprised at the great quality with NONE of the CLOUDING or LIGHT LEAKAGE common to most LED TV's (although there have been some complaints to the contrary).  After calibrating it in the CUSTOM mode we were able to come very close to the quality of our LG Tv's.  Since it is Sony's mid-range quality TV it doesn't have as many custom settings (i.e. local dimming) but I've found most of these EXTRA features to be not so necessary as observed on our LG's.  The brightness and natural color is more than satisfactory and we enjoy the minimal reflective screen in our BRIGHT family room.It's also an attractive TV.  We have received compliments from our neighbors on the thin frame and polished metal stand.  It will look very classy in any room.  It took a couple of hours to get used to the slight reflection of the program being viewed on the chrome stand.  We no longer notice it and for most it will probably be a non-issue.

I really do love it. I bought it to replace a 52 Inch Sony from 2008 (also a KDL model), which is going in the game room. The picture is outstanding, but my living room is kind of deep, so that helps with the sharpness. It is a 70 inch screen and it's not going to be as sharp up close as say a 52 inch since the pixels themselves will be larger. It looks incredibly sharp in my living room though. The picture is amazing, and the 3D is quite awesome (I watched Jurassic Park 3D the first day i got it). The apps work fine, a little draggy as you might expect, and the Sony Entertainment Network is cool to check out your new features on. The internet browser itself is not user friendly at all and quite clunky. I don't even bother, I just use my PS3 for that (which is also slow and clunky but not nearly as bad). I read complaints about the tv being slow and not accepting the network, but I've had no problems with mine, it hooked right up to the Wifi which is all the way across the house and upstairs and I stream Amazon Video just fine through it, at at least 1080I.

This TV is HUGE!!! I must admit that I did research for several months before buying this. I looked heavily at Vizio, LG, Sharp and Samsung before settling on this one. Only Samsung came close to picture quality. This TV replaced a Sony KDL55EX640 55-Inch which went into the other room. No Regrets. I wanted a quality TV built to last. You get what you pay for!!!  If you experience connection issues when watching 3D it is probably because you are not using a HIGH SPEED HDMI Cable. Check to be sure it is v1.4 with a minimum speed of 10.2 Gbps or higher.  This was my first 3D TV and my first 3D movie was Avatar. It was like watching a different movie, only way better. I was blown away by the 3D effect. This is a PASSIVE 3D TV and the biggest reason I bought it. I have read to many negative reviews about ACTIVE glasses being to heavy, causing headaches and uncomfortable for eye glass wearers, which I am. I watched the 3D Avatar movie followed by Cars 2 in 3D with no issues at all. Also the passive glasses don't need batteries or need to be re-charged. Comes with 4 pairs of sturdy 3D passive glasses.  3D Conversion: This TV continues to amaze. Any content you throw at it can be converted to 3D. For example HD TV Programming and standard Blu-Ray, for example. Not quite the impact as a 3D Blu-Ray movie but very, very good results.  I receive my HD programming from DIRECTV and 99% of my programming is HD. The HD images look outstanding and Blu-Ray even better. Even non-HD programming is improved and looks great. I could not detect any ghosting and no speed or motion issues at all while watching a football game in HD. No pixeling at all, ever. I did notice a \"Soap Opera Effect\" occasionally with some of my HD programming but I noticed that it comes and goes depending on the programming, I guess. Never with 3D or Blu-Ray and never with a live HD broadcast such as a football or baseball game.  My viewing distance is a little over 14 feet.  I had no issues, at all with the remote. Start up time was about 8 seconds from the time I hit the power button. The sound was the only area, I felt, that could use some improvement. Two down firing speakers with no bass at all but it is acceptable.  The only adjustments I made was that I turned off the light sensor found in the \"ECO\" menu under settings and I used the Monster Calibration disc/DVD with good results. The adjustments were very minor. (I went up on the brightness and down on the picture after I turned off the light sensor) I am not very interested with the internet capabilities. I have an internet ready 3D BD/DVD player plus a host of other internet devices. I did hook it up wirelessly to my router in order to receive updates automatically.  A cool feature I probably won't use is this TV will receive wireless TV signals from a Directv Whole Home SWM, Genie Network and will allow you to have one less wire going to your TV. Not really a big deal unless you hang the TV on the wall like I did. This is good if you don't have a Surround Sound Receiver with HDMI 3D standby pass-through (Which I do). I have everything hooked up to my surround sound receiver and only one HDMI cable to the TV. This way I only have 2 wires coming out from the back of the TV. The power cord and one Superthin HDMI cable.  This TV has ARC (Audio Return Channel) and is MHL Compatible. The TV has a designated ARC HDMI port and when using a v1.4 HDMI cable and hooked up to the designated ARC port of your surround sound receiver eliminates the need for a digital optical (Tos-Link) cable between the TV and the receiver. The MHL port is the number 2 HDMI port. When hard wired to your smartphone it allows you to transfer pics and videos to the TV  The TV has PIP and P&P; functions but I could not find the PIP function in the options menu. I called SONY support and was told the PIP function only appears when a computer is connected to the TV through any of the HDMI ports. I was also told that the Apps are fixed and that you will not have the option of downloading any or deleting the ones present. (I believe Samsung has this feature) Also has an internet browser.  Another cool feature that I probably will use is Sony's Wi-Fi Direct Mode which completely bypasses your router. This will allow you to watch videos and pics from your smartphone. You can also do Wi-Fi Mirroring if your smartphone is Miracast enabled.

Luckily the tech department at Abt saw the problem right away and assured me it was not normal, was very rare and offered a replacement or refund.  After I told them to replace it, they told me they love this TV and don't see many problems with them as compared to others.  This was reassuring to me, especially since they waited until I made the decision to share that.So despite the problem with the initial unit, I'm still rating this TV at 5 stars.  I spent quite a bit of time comparing it to the competition and found that I would have had to pay substantially more for the same features and polish in other units.- The picture was, in my opinion, as good or better than the competition at any price up to substantially more expensive.- The sound from the speakers is better than what I heard in any of the others I compared to (I use a receiver for movies, music, and games but use the standard speakers for day to day use), very clear and plenty loud for our large living room.- 3D is theatre quality and is of the passive variety, meaning no expensive, battery powered glasses.  There were only a couple other TVs that had 3D at this screen size (I believe they were all active type) and price point but had some sorely lackluster other features.  Most of the competition was another $300-$400 for models with 3D that compared to all the features in the Sony- Smart TV features are easy to use, include all the apps I need and are quick functioning.  I will say they are not as flashy as some out there but they are substantially better than others.- Overall appearance is excellent.  It has the obligatory black frame as are most of the competition (though some had a plastic frame where this one has metal) but the stand is much nicer then most, chromed steel, u-shaped and super sturdy as compared to some of the junky ones out there.  We plan to move in a year or so, I didn't want to mount it on the wall for a short period of time, so it was good that it has a great stand.-  It has game lag features, a mode that allows two players who would normally view a split screen to see their individual screen by using the 3D glasses, meaning two players can view the entire 60\" screen instead of half.  If you like games, this is a pretty cool feature.-  4 HDMI ports, 2 USB ports, and the obligatory other ports.  This is standard in this price range and is the reason I didn't go to a lower end model without 3D or smart features, my high end receiver stopped working for HDMI pass through and I needed a TV that could take 3-4 HDMI inputs.I've been using this unit for about 3 weeks now and I've been paying closer attention to friends' TVs when I go to their houses, I'm still elated with all the features I got for the price in this TV, as I said above, I don't think there's a better deal to be had.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Could be a great tv, but beware blobs on display.", "Author": "JoPython", "ReviewID": "R1524EC9UBKD46", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the picture quality; black levels, color, image clarity.

Sony uses some great smoothing technology that really makes the graphics and text pop.If you are looking for a new TV that can be used for gaming, I HIGHLY recommend this TV.

There was also a free 30 day music unlimited trial.  And best of all there IS an Amazon Video App built in to this TV.  For the free Sony offers you need to go into the apps (SEN) section, select the app and follow the instructions to get your free subscription, but it was not difficult at all to get or set up.

It has a great HD picture when watching blu ray movies or playing video games and I found the menus easy to navigate through. I followed someone else's review on here to manually set up the picture and then adjusted things slightly to where I thought they looked best.

I use PS4/AppleTV for netflix, etc. so I didn't even set up the TV's wifi/netflix/other apps. I also didn't buy it for the 3D, but I tried it out and it's just fine.

This is the main reason it didn't get 5 stars.When I change input to PS4 from watching TV, the \"sound mode\" automatically changes to \"game\" which isn't the ideal mode when watching a movie on PS4, so I have to manually get the remote that came with the TV (I use a Tivo remote normally) and change the sound mode.When unpausing a show through Tivo, the sound is half of a second delayed to come back on and you end up missing a couple words. This may be my HDMI cable since I haven't noticed the problem with PS4 or AppleTV.Pizza effect: on a black screen, there is quite a bit of white light visible on the screen, but this isn't noticeable when watching TV unless the scene is very very dark.Weight of the TV.

Passive 3D doesn't have quite the \"pop\" as active 3D in my opinion, but the trade-off for lighter, cheaper glasses is well worth it.  We recently had 9 people watching a feature, and everyone was blown away.  That would be hard to do with active glasses.  I know I'll be watching more 3D because passive is just easier to use.  It's an excellent 3D experience, and I won't go back to active glasses ever again.I would recommend disabling the efficiency and light sensing features.  I saw a significant increase in picture quality.  I found the picture settings to be adequate, but I did make a few adjustments to backlighting and contrast to compete with a bright room.

I have used many sizes and types of TVs from Friends houses. Although I was not impressed when I saw this at HH Greg, all the TVs there of any size had the same issues with motion and ghost images. The Sony did a bit better than the others, but still was hoping the image was better. Read hundreds of reviews. The people rating it poor stated it came in damaged after they opened the box 6 months later. How can that be a Manufacture problem. When you buy it, always open and check it. Some people complained of a slow remote. The remote at the store was slow, but with out any 300 devices looking for or sending out commands, this TV preformed very well, not slow to me. Starting up the TV took a few extra seconds, IT IS A 70\" MONSTER, what did you expect! The first 1080P movie I put up on was WOW, no motion issues, no ghosting images and that was on a Broadcast station. Like all remotes, they take time to get use to, after time I knew where each button was while in the dark. The Blacks/whites and colors stood off the screen. 3D was fantastic. The only thing I did not like about it was the stand. It is a U shaped stand, would have been better as a completed metal on all 4 sides. I chose the Bravia to match my other Bravia devices and Glad I did.If you was quality, great picture and a good price - This IS the TV you want.Do price shop though, as I found Best Buys was out of stock in their warehouse and all local stores. HH Greg had to order it in, and tried to get me to buy a different one, but beat Beat Buy price by $50.

PQ for any TV is impacted on the video source, but if you have a good quality video source from your cable or direct TV provider, you will not be disappointed. Blue ray PQ is outstanding. For watching sports, I recommend turning off MotionFlow. MotionFlow creates that \"soap opera-effect\". It may be good for movies (subjective), but causes blurring of rapid moving objects such as a hockey puck.3)Screen uniformity: No issues with blotches or light leakage that I can tell. I'm not an extreme videophille, so perhaps I just don't notice them.4)3D: Initially I was not a big fan of 3D TV, but Sony's incorporation of passive 3D technology creates an experience that is much more enjoyable for me. The glasses are comfortable. Even simulated 2D to 3D is pretty decent on this TV.5)Video games: I'm a casual gamer and I have had no issues that I have observed so far. This TV has been rated great for video games, see belowhttp://www.displaylag.com/introducing-2013s-best-hdtvs-for-gaming-part-1/6)Screen reflectiveness: My room has a lot of open windows. Luckily this TV has a \"semi matte\" screen, which helps reduce reflections. I was initially interested in the Sharp or Vizio 70 inch, which are full matte screens. But, I felt the PQ was somewhat diminished because of the full matte screens. I still enjoy watching Samsung TVs, but the highly reflective screens were not an option for me.7)Placement of TV: I am using the stand that accompanied the TV. It's not the best looking stand, just adequate, I wish it was black. I've read on other forums the stand caused their Sony R550A to lean back a bit. I haven't had any noticeable issues, but be aware of this.8)Viewing angles: As with most LED TVs, PQ is less optimal at increased viewing angles, and this holds true for this TV. I didn't notice increased viewing angles being better than other LED TVs of similar size on PQ.9)Price: I think the price of this TV is very competitive with the other 70 inch smart 3D TVs. I've heard great comments for both the Vizio and Sharp, but this Sony TV fit my needs a bit better.In summary, a great mid tier 70 inch LED TV that I am very happy with.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looking for an excellent 3D TV...", "Author": "Edmonson", "ReviewID": "R302STHCMFRI8Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a good 3D TV for a while now. The 3D on this edge lit LED/LCD TV is as good as any I've seen. It also has very good uniformity compared to say the edge lit LG LM5850 which had strong hot spots in the corners, though it's not as good as a plasma for uniformity. For excellent 3D one needs high contrast and a bright screen and this one has those in a normally lit or somewhat dim room. Where this TV lets me down to some degree is when viewed in a dark room, and then the blacks don't appear very black at all even if one turns down the backlighting to zero. If one likes to watch movies in a darkened room then it might be best to look at a higher end TV, possibly a plasma, like the Panasonic ST, VT or ZT, or Samsung PNF8500, though except for the Panasonic ST one will have to pay two or three times more for these TVs. If one watches a lot of TV or sports where the images are usually quite bright then this likely wouldn't be an issue, but if one enjoys watching films like Prometheus, or Cabin in the Woods, then one might wish they had bought a TV with darker blacks. I also found that the tv screen was quite glossy and so reflected objects in front of the tv as compared to a mat finished LED/LCD screen, or a tv with anti-glare filters like the plasma Panasonic ST, VT, ZT or the Samsung PNF8500, which is also the best performing plasma in bright light conditions.Another thing I do like about this TV is the passive 3D, since it doesn't require battery operated glasses and one doesn't get the flicker one tends to get with the active glasses which is more common on the plasma TVs. Also this TV only weighs about 41 lbs and a plasma in a similar size would be about 50% heavier. The colors also appear very good on this TV and there are numerous settings in the menu for one to adjust. This TV is also a smart TV and  can hook up to the internet wirelessly. So if one wants a excellent 3D TV that is priced under $1000 then this might be the TV for you.With regards to black levels: one can push the dark levels a bit lower if one goes into the Advanced Settings and turns on the LED Motion Mode. As long as one has an overhead light, or standing lamp, with a variable light switch one can adjust the light in an otherwise dark room to get an excellent picture from this TV.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony KDL-70R550A 70-Inch 120Hz 1080p 3D Internet LED HDTV (Black)", "Author": "Victor Trang", "ReviewID": "R1LKRW8PK25SYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first time that I've purchased a television online so of course I had to go with the trusted site like Amazon.

The motion flow is pretty impressive but I already have a Sony with motion flow and wished this was 240Hz. But this TV can't be beat. I'm so glad I went for the 70\" instead of the 65\" or 60\". It's not too heavy given the size of it. Also it comes with free NetFlix and Hulu Plus for a year! Can't beat that! The wifi is much better than other TVs and the apps on it are pretty solid. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants a quality TV for a decent price. You do definitely need external speakers for this because it's not as loud as you would want it to be.

Ended up pulling the trigger on this one after reading many of the posts here and elsewhere. Ordered it from Amazon back in June and it was ready to be delivered the last week in June. However, delays in my basement project forced me to have the shipping company hold it in their warehouse for 3 weeks! Ended up getting the TV delivered in late July but didn't get it installed until literally last night. And man, it's only been a day and a half, but all of the waiting for this TV was absolutely worth it!  I found the website called whatsthemodel.com very helpful for comparing and deciphering model numbers of major TV brands.I'm no videophile, but my frame of reference are the two plasma TVs I own - a 50\" Panasonic and a 42\" Samsung.

I only started to dabble with the settings today, but popping in my Avengers Bluray last night for a quick check proved to be the best moment of the night! This TV is BIG - I mean, it is one massive wall eater! I have this bad boy mounted on my wall!Cable in HD on channels like ESPN, HBO, etc. look fantastic.  I'm still messing with settings to get the perfect mix, but so far, so good!  I can confidently say that both DVDs, Blurays and video games also look absolutely incredible on this TV.I watched a 3D Bluray (Star Trek Into the Darkness) and all I can say is WOW. I always thought 3D was a gimmick, but all my movies will be 3D affairs from now on! The picture was absolutely stunning. I don't think watching regular TV in 3D will be practical but for movies, it's a no brainer, this is an must-see experience! For those concerned with gaming, this set does not disappoint. Gaming was great with no discernible lag - even for twitch-type games.I heavily considered the LG 60 here due to stellar reviews but ultimately opted for the extra screen size of the Sony.B00BB9OOLKAnd for those who are wondering, I don't have any of the known issues with LEDs on this set.

It's really just one and it didn't even convince me to take out a star. Still, worth mentioning. Netflix streaming via TV didn't work for me very well. It gets stuck after some time. Sony claims it's because of ISP, but users discovered that it only affects Netflix and only on Sony TVs.

After having such amazing luck with our next 46 inch Sony Bravia, we didn't hesitate looking to Sony for our new Media room.What we love:The quality of OTA TV is simply stunning.  Blu-Ray and DVD's look amazing on this.  3D is awesome and lots of fun for our family.  As we have 3 young kids, the passive 3D is so much easier for us.  We don't have to worry about expensive glasses, recharging, etc.  My son wears glasses and has a hard time with active glasses.  We have had a room full of little boys watching a 3D movie.  I don't mind at all handing out glasses to them.  We also really like how it natively supports Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon.Some minor grips:It takes a long time to get the \"Internet\" sources once the TV is powered on.  It can take up to 60 seconds.  We have it plugged directly in to the network via ethernet.  So, I am not sure why there needs to be such a lag.I get lost in the menus.  We have had it since July 5, 2013.  I would think I would have gotten used to the menus.  I'm not sure what it is.  Maybe they are not very intuitive.The menus and options have a tiny bit of lag.  It isn't instant like I am used to on my other Sony's.  Once I depress a button, it can take two or three seconds to respond.  I have gotten used to it, but it is still a pain.One thing to note:We have experienced the issue of the screen going black when switching from various inputs.  I have always pushed the screen off/on button to turn it back on.  I am going to contact Sony about it.  It is annoying.  Another reviewer posted a solution they got from Customer Service.  I have not tried it nor have I contacted Sony yet.Bottom Line:It is perfect for our Media Room where it is watched by a family of 5 that includes 3 small children.  It is easy for my 9 and 7 year old to operate.  I am sure there are \"better\" TV's out there.  The price, features, and size make this TV a home run in our house.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "This TV has been fantastic.

I've been buying Sony  TV's for year and there is a reason why QUALITY  This smart tv is very nicely made. I have had this TV for about a month and haven't experienced any of the screen artifact color problems and spotting that some of the bad reviews have mentioned.If you are ordering this or any other LED tv and  you live in a cold climate  be sure not to turn the TV on until it has warmed up and reached Room temperature ,if not you could damage the television.After mine was acclimated to the room temp the first thing I did was recalibrate  the picture settings. There are several Blu-ray Discs on the market made for just this purpose,well worth the money and a little extra time. The one I used was Disney's Wow HD Home Theater disc. It's very easy to use  and it walks you through the different adjustments for a truly incredible tv picture. The black colors are better than most LED TV's I've seen. Getting blacker blacks is a problem for LED televisions but the technology has improved greatly.The only thing that stopped me from giving a full 5 stars was that the remote should have back lighting. There are far too many buttons for it not to have back lighting. Instead I use the Logitech Harmony Ultimate remote. Look in to them they will change the way you control your audio and video equipment.On the whole this Sony TV is one of the best I've seen and the solid chassis construction seems so much nicer than most of the other sets I've looked at. To me Sony's quality has always been worth paying a little extra for.One more note after 2 months of ownership:If you like 3D this is the one for you! The passive 3D is truly stunning. The passive 3D glasses are so easy on the eyes compared the active 3D glasses used in other 3D models. You'll hardly know you have the glasses on even over eye glasses.I just can't say enough good things about Sony and this TV.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ed the TV man", "Author": "edward d murphy", "ReviewID": "R326BHPY9TJTO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 50\" KDL-50R 550A is an outstanding TV.

I am a cord cutter.  I bought this TV because it was internet capable.  To my great disappointment it takes four minutes for the TV to connect via the wireless connection.  It takes 40 seconds through the wired ethernet connection.  I'm quite amazed Sony could release this TV with such a bad connect time.  I called Sony support.  They asked me a bunch of questions and then said \"this is normal operation\". Ugggh. Really Sony?  This is worse than waiting for a vacuum tube TV to be ready.The user interface is a little slow.  Seems to be an underpowered processor running the TV.  But I find it acceptable.  I have no idea how this compares to other TVs.The Sony TV itself is chromecast capable.  So, four minutes after turning on the TV, I can initiate play of netflix and youtube programming from my Android phone.  I didn't expect that.  Very nice feature.  This TV has a lot of features.  Although the TV supports Hulu Plus, it doesn't have the chromecast feature.To work around the slow connect time I bought a Chromecast and plugged it in to one of the TV's HDMI inputs.  Chromecast is always connected.  No delay after turning on the TV.  It strikes me as silly every time I see both the Chromecast and the TV in my phone's youtube/netflix apps connect menu.  Chromecast does support hulu plus.  Interestingly the Chromecast will not play netflix 3D content in 3D, but the TV will.  I also noticed Chromecast will not play Amazon Instant Video content.

I was torn between this one and: Samsung PN60F8500 60 Inch 1080p PlasmaI opted for this one because at this time it was cheaper being a non-plasma TV and of course for the extra size. I'll probably snatch up that Samsung Plasma when it comes down in price down the road as it's rated as one of the best Plasma's for 2013.The picture is amazing and I've yet to even use the 3D because I don't own any 3D movies yet, but I'm really looking forward to it as everyone raved how great it is in reviews. Anything I watch in HD looks eerily life like almost like people are actually in my living room. That took me some getting used to. I guess if you aren't use to high end HD programming on a \"real\" TV that's designed to support it, you'll see what I mean.Remote is fine, nothing mind blowing.Sound is fine, nothing mind blowing. I use a home theater system anyways for sound.Overall look is very sleek and appealing. The stand is very stylish (and sturdy) compared to other TV's - easy to assemble the stand, but you'll definitely need a buddy to help you lift the screen onto the stand (I'm a big guy and figured I could handle it, but you'll want help so you don't drop this beaut or break your back).The built-in Wi-Fi is high quality. It picks up my Wi-Fi signal from across the house and hasn't skipped a beat anytime I watch Netflix.I haven't even played around with all the options and apps yet that are built-in because I've been waiting on a few more things in the mail before I can finally feel like it's settled in and I can get down to it, but I'm sure they're superb like all the reviews I read before I bought it mentioned.It has plenty of connections for all of your devices.If you have the money to throw at it and finally want a large screen in your house, this is the one (or the above Samsung one).

I contacted SONY and was told that they'd send me an exact replacement. Well, the rep that I spoke to must've been confused or just didn't want to call me back to tell me that they didn't have any more new 60R550A sets available. What I received was a 70R520A. I immediately refused the delivery thinking it was a mistake and called SONY. After speaking with 3 different reps in two different departments for almost an hour, I found out that they intentionally sent me the 70R520A without notifying me. I told them that it was unacceptable to send me a TV that didn't match the specs of the TV I was getting replaced (the 520A is a non-3D version of the R550A) even if it was a bigger TV.

You can then adjust the other settings to your taste and if you mess repeat steps  for the baseline and then try again.I was going to return this TV after 3 days till I figured out the above tuning process.  This is the only 3-D passive TV in the 70\" screen size. I played 3-D Avatar and Hobbit and it was awesome. Picture quality and 3-D effects were outstanding using my Sony BDP-S790. The simulated 3-D feature looks pretty good for  watching HD TV broadcasts for wild life and outdoor landscape.The browser and YouTube interface is terrible  and Network configuration is a bit painful. Even though my laptop, ipad, AppleTV quickly find my router and connect, the Sony wireless device takes a while to find my router and eventually fails.  Have to try several times to get connected.  Since I use AppleTV for watching YouTube and my laptop for browser the network configuration issue don't affect me much.  There is Sony Entertainment package which I believe is decent that you can use if you can get a stable network connectivity.

The only thing is that there is NO Promotional Offer App available. I have tried numerous times but it's just not there. Has anyone out there had the same problem in setting up the Netflix offer?

I was going up to a 60\u201d over a 50\u201d and this model was a bit thinner than my Panasonic plasma. The interface of this model is very slow, painfully slow. There are other brands that make this \u201cSmart TV\u201d seem like its from 2009. I bought the tv specifically because of its ability to connect with the Genie from DirecTV, which it does. It only takes 1:30min to start up\u2026 The interface is much, much slower than the clients that connect to my other sets off of the Genie. I will end up moving the Genie to this location which entirely defeats the purpose of the TV. This however I guess I could live with if it wasn\u2019t for the vastly inconsistent backlighting and shadowing that occurs within the picture. You won\u2019t notice it until the first time that you sit down at night to watch a movie. As soon as the screen has a somewhat uniform color too it such as a sky scene or a shot of a yard, your eyes will immediately tract to the very distracting inconsistencies. I am on my second set sent from Sony to try to remedy this issue but the \u201cnew\u201d (I think it\u2019s refurbished) set is worse than the first. I am going to make a third call in to Sony tomorrow 3-32-2014 to see if anything can be done but I do not have much faith.

It has great black ranges for not being a plasma, but still provides all of the pros of a LED TV.1080p Quality:All of my devices use 1080p quality, so 720p is not something I would see. From the quick settings changes that I made, 720p looked good, but as always, 1080p is much better. There is no comparison of 1080p to any Plasma, at least in my room.3D:The TV uses passive 3D, which doesn't require powered glasses. Very nice as you don't have to wear heavy glasses that cause your eyes to strain. Having said that, I can count on one hand how many times I have used 3D. Maybe it just isn't for me, and maybe someday it will get more use, but at this time, it is more like an extra feature than a necessity. I will say, if you are looking for a 3D TV, passive glasses are the way to go, and the picture quality is amazing, even streaming from Netflix! The size of the screen goes a long way to bringing that theater experience home.CONS:There aren't a lot. Sony really needs to work on their menu response time, but I hardly ever use the menu's anyway.

The first time I started it up there was something weird about the backlight.  There were light patches all over the screen.  When watching a movie at night the light patches almost bleached out the dark scenes.  I did some research and found out this happens on a lot of sets.  There were several suggestions (turn down the backlight, try wiping the screen with a soft cloth, turn off eco settings.)  None of these actually got rid of it.  I took a picture of the screen and took it in to BestBuy where I bought the set three days earlier.  They said it was a definite defect and I should bring it back in.  After trying to locate another they determined every store in their system was sold out.  I then went to Fry's and they only had four in stock.  Took it home and plugged it in...no patches.  It looked great even on factory settings.  The 3D is very close to theater quality.  I love the motion flow.  Sony uses a very bright backlight to get vivid colors so you may have to turn it down a bit.  The netflix button is very handy.  I also love that when you're browsing youtube on your phone you can broadcast it to your tv to make video selection a little easier.  The phone mirroring is a very fun feature that I get a lot of use out of.  The sony entertainment network button has lots of short fun clips and interesting apps to look at but I haven't spent a lot of time looking through them.There are only things I can say negative about this tv.  One is when comparing to the LG's or Samsungs in the same range Sony has fewer bells and whistles.  Not a huge deal, but a voice search and better web browser would put this set over the top.  Two is when switching to 3D the resolution suffers a bit.  You can see lines in the screen so things aren't as silky smooth when comparing to normal 1080p.

Unfortunately I confirmed that I am one of the few people that are sensitive to plasma trails and flicker. The TV was perfect, great picture but I just could not watch it. More than 30 minutes of viewing any content and headaches etc started. I already knew I had issues with DLP tech but was hoping that the newer Plasma would work. Back to Amazon it went.  Amazon was great with the return and made it painless.Since my eyes are not bothered by LCD/LED tech, I ordered the 70\" KDL-70RR550A from Amazon. It was delivered from Amazon two days early. The Air Freight Company showed up within the stated window, unboxed, attached the pedestal and placed it on the stand. They patiently waited while I connected the HDMI, LAN, and Antenna cables so I could check out the set.I am coming from a Toshiba Regza full array local dimming set with great blacks. The R550 holds it's own in that regard. I have noticed no flash lighting, edge light bleed, or banding. DSE is not noticeable nor have I noticed any lack of uniformity. The out of the box custom setting with ECO sensor disabled is very accurate.I decided to dust off the i1Pro and Calman and check the new 70' R550 out. First up was a check of Custom/Warm at out of the box settings. 48fL, Greyscale with errors all well below a delta E of 3, a very flat gamma of 2.2, primaries all pretty close, and two out of the three secondaries spot on with the third fairly close. Color temperature was almost at D6500 erring slightly to the warm side. I ran through again selecting Custom/Neutral and found that the Color Temperature had jumped to around 9500 which of course made the Greyscale go way out of whack. However the Color and Gamma were still quite good.For viewing in our house I dialed back the lumens a bit to around 42fL. I adjusted Contrast/Picture to just below where clipping was observed. Brightness did not need to be adjusted as the 50 setting was spot on. Red was adjusted using a 100% red field to 21% of the 100% white field per REC709.

I checked out a bit of Avatar in 3D and Sony has done a excellent job with passive 3D implementation.Finally a screen ratio of 2.35:1 is truly emersive!A couple of Cons:Smart TV features work well but are slow to load.Because there is so much screen real estate some motion control is necessary.  Otherwise screen blurring can be evident with slow pans.  MotionFlow set to Standard handles this nicely.

The Smart TV functions are also very laggy, as if I'm using a slow computer. Roku and a video game console are much better for this. Sony also advertises an \"Auto-on\" for their products with the TV...that it will detect if a system (such as a Playstation) is turned on, and the TV will turn on automatically. Unfortunately, this doesn't work on Playstation 4...a Sony product!For as expensive as Sony TVs are, you would expect them to fully support everything and stand behind their advertising...but they haven't.

By the way it was cheaper than here on Amazon since I paid with cash. :)I'm an IT Tech and I've been connecting my actual PCs to TVs since 1998. So I had the same purpose this time as well. Oh, just to let you know I NEVER watch TV channels...they just simply wash your brain...grrhhh.Yes, you can also call me a SONY fan since I've never bought any other brand's TV, but SONY. Therefore I'm an expert lol.Cut long story short I tested it with sport, documentary, YouTube, Sci-fi movies in Blu-Ray quality, internet browsing, etc. and the QUALITY IS JUST AMAZING! I only did some minor changes in settings and the colors and the contours are just perfect for your eyes.And finally just a thought about the more expensive SONY TVs. Yes, they have really a different processor inside and the features are also richer, but the average user has no clue about the difference. Don't get me wrong I don't judge, but unless you are picky tech geek you do not need those extras. Especially when you pick a SONY. It's like with German cars in the premium category: even the cheapest model has more features and better quality than the most expensive South Korean or Japanese cars.I had been making my research for months before I bought this TV, but I did not regret a single penny I spent on it!Good Job Again, SONY!", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tv!", "Author": "cavemen \"FJC\"", "ReviewID": "RWD0DMCEC95D1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall very happy with quality with the TV.

This one seems to handle gradients fine.Mostly writing this review to let people know that until there is a software update the Miracast support is terrible. They do not support actual Miracast (which makes me question how they can call this Miracast). So your Windows 8.1 laptop with wireless display built in, or any laptop with Miracast installed will not work! Very disappointed when Sony's support informed me of this.I really enjoy this TV because of the quality and the overall look (very modern with minimal bezel). Would have been a 5/5 if it were not for the half supported Miracast. I guess the Xbox One will have it so that will solve that issue in a few months.

Notice the sound muting at seconds 11-14 and 18.I am returning this TV within first 2 hours of use. I have no issues with Picture Quality, Setup. The only big issue is that this TV intermittently cuts off sound to your sound system when using your Cable Company's DVR.This is a well documented issue with Sony dating back to 2009. I tried everything possible to fix it, changed HDMI cables, upgraded firmware, swapped DVR, even swapped it with my old TV; nothing fixed it.You would only face this issue if you have it connected to a sound system, in my case, it's the Bose Cinemate Home Theater System.This link discusses the same issue in detail:[...]", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "The most SHOCKINGLY Brilliant TV ever for this price!!!", "Author": "Craigy77", "ReviewID": "R2OVXJL001PX2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The most shockingly brilliant TV ever!!!!I must say that I took a very long time researching a 3D TV that had what I was looking for.  I read all the reviews of everyone on all review sites including Amazon.  After looking at TV's in different stores and online it came down to features and not really the price.  I would have spent $5 to 6K for a 3D TV including the 4K that could deliver what this one at $2100.00 has literally BLOWN away.  I received this Sony 70 this morning in great anticipation and I must tell you that It was a thrill to fire this thing up and get my settings to what I like.  A great start for anyone that doesn't have the Spears and Munsil HD calibration disc is to read EDWARD from (NC) review on June 30th 2013.  His settings will get you a great start then you can tweak the fine details.  I like a little more color so I boosted mine to 62 instead of the 48 that Spears & Musil suggest.  But everything else that Edward says you really need to take to heart because you will have great frustration if you don't.  That is what is so awesome about this 3D TV is the level of settings that you can tweak.  I have watched 3 3D Movies already and it literally Blew me away.  If yoy need more glasses Stay with the glasses that comes with your purchase, the Sony TDG-500P passive glasses are fantastic because they are so light and the design is flawless.  Other 3D glasses like what you get at the theater will work fine but the comfort of these is unmatchable.  Finally a shout out to those few who threw out negative reviews, I believe that some of you literally may have caught a once in a million lemon but other who throw out technical garbe like ghosting, flashlighting, clouding and not to buy an edge lit TV.  I feel very sorry for those of you who do not take the time to calibrate this BEAST of a TV that once you calibrate it probably there is none of the effects that these reviewers are throwing at you.  I am a CEO in the real world and I must pay attention to a lot of details in business.  This TV has all the details and more but you must know how to use it or you will overlook the buy of the Century.  Always buy the 5 year extended warranty the price is shockingly low for no worries for 5 years even though Sony is a great brand in reliability as a CEO I always recommend a warranty.  Thank you Amazon for the great service, the PILOT delivery agent was outstanding and performed his job with great customer service.  I recommend this 3D TV without any reservations.

I could care less about it and there don't seem to be many channels that broadcast it.  We have the set as part of a surround sound system so we don't use the tv speakers. We also use our DVD player for streaming Netflix and Hulu since the sound goes thru the receiver.  We will probably eventually buy a Roku and plug it into the surround receiver.  I think that it looks great on the wall and everyone that sees it comments on the excellent picture.  We sit directly in front of the TV and there is no issue with the picture being viewed from a side angle.  We can see it from the nearby kitchen area that is part of our family room.  This is off-center and the picture is still excellent.  This TV was more expensive than the Sharp and Vizio but I have much more confidence in the Sony.  So far, it has been excellent in all respects..  I did see the new Sony 4k which was much more expensive but smaller.  That TV had a weird configuration with speakers built-in.  This took up a lot of space and added significantly to the dimensions of the TV.  I didn't need any tv speakers since we have a pretty sophisticated surround system.  The 4k picture is better because of the resolution but I am quite happy with the 1080 resolution.  Anyway,  I am very pleased with this set.  I also bought the 40 inch Sony for my wine/bar, which is typical Sony--excellent.

Digeorgio", "ReviewID": "R25D2UTX5NIP2V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had looked for a new TV for over a year and finally bought the 50 inch version of this Sony.  I didn't buy it from Amazon - I bought it at a local brick and mortar when it went on sale. I read reviews here about backlight bleeding and clouding - and thankfully, I don't seem to have any of that.  The picture quality is fantastic in my opinion.  I will be up front and say that I came from a 36\" Sony Wega tube Style TV from the early 2000's. It was a 4:3 unit of course and it was not HD.  But it still had a very good picture for the time.  What finally pushed me to move to the flat panels was that I hate that much of the picture was cutoff on many programs due to the 4:3 aspect ratio.Compared to the Wega, this TV's picture quality in HD is so much better!  In fact, I looked at many TVs including plasmas - and while I like the plasmas for the black levels and refresh rates, I have a bright room and plasmas just aren't bright enough in bright areas (my opinion) - and I also found that dark scenes are very muddy with a plasma.  I did evaluations in the store comparing dark scenes - and with the plasma I could not make out what was in the scene when it was a really dark scene.In all, I thought the picture on this Sony was better or at least equal to anything I looked at - including Samsung, LG and Panasonic models.  I had looked at some Vizio models which I know many people love, but I didn't see anything that stood out in particular. I had looked at last years Sony models (EX and some HX models) and I thought this years models were better - at least in the lower price ranges.I think the viewing angle on this model is also quite good - better than many LCDs and better than some of last year Sony models.  Not as good as a plasma though.  I really don't have a problem with it however.  The sound is almost as good as my old Wega and that's saying a lot!As for cons - I don't like that it doesn't always connect to wireless quickly.  Sometimes it takes a few minutes or you have to go into the menu and refresh.  Seems like it can't resolve the DNS automatically at times.The screen is somewhat reflective - and that can be a hassle in the afternoons at times.  I usually close the blinds to reduce the glare.Lastly - I like the remote, but I wish it had a qwerty keyboard on the back like some of the Vizio models.  That would really help with searches.I like the free year of HuluPlus and Netflix - that's about $200 in savings right there.Overall - I am very happy with this unit and I have no regrets.  I hope it holds up as well as my old Sony Wega which is actually still working fine after 12 years.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really awesome picture.", "Author": "Computer Hardware Services", "ReviewID": "R1UFQNPTO74VDW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well I am already a Sony fan and this is another one that hit the nail on the head for what I can afford.

Watched Avatar 3D, played some Xbox 360, Netflix, and played around with settings quite a bit. The viewing angle is superior to my previous televisions. We had a sectional with a side that we had a hard time seeing our previous TV, I can barely see any distortion from extreme side angles now. The glare on the screen is minimal, with lights on in the room the picture is still very visible. I spent some time looking closely for dead pixels and couldn't find any. Also no sign of the white glow issue some reviews have mentioned.The apps are very responsive (relative to a Vizio TV I have). Setup Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HuluPlus. Also tried some of the other apps - an HD Scenes app, and a 3D demo app.We didn't have any trouble getting the 12 months of Netflix credited to our already existing account. That was one question I had about the 12 months free Netflix promotion - whether it could be applied to an existing account - it can! We also created a new HuluPlus account with the free 12 months.Mounted this on a B001LL5JDAVery nice mount! Anyways, we didn't mess with the stand that came with the TV so I can't comment too much on that. The front bottom of the TV is like chrome and reflective. I would have preferred this to not be like that, but I noticed while watching a movie that it wasn't distracting.I'm using the external audio, so I ran an optical audio cable from the TV to my sound receiver which worked fine.Overall very happy with the purchase and no regret at this point for making the decision to go with Sony (was also considering similarly priced Vizio).", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent display, bad smart features", "Author": "Evil Hubie", "ReviewID": "R1AS6KZGEOT7L8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you're planning to use this TV solely as an HD / 3D display, you'll be OK.

The TV is very limited in what video and audio formats it can play. Browsing though the contents of DLNA servers takes literally minutes. Media listings don't include the name of the media-- you have to click on each file to see what it is. There's no way to fast forward quickly in a video (I think the fastest is 4x, and sometimes not at all for certain formats).

Harris", "ReviewID": "R1G6PHWBNJGBT9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had to change this rating to a 1 star due to some really bad flashlighting, light blobs, and uniformity issues.  Until I can get one that isn't glaringly noticeable, this will be a 1 star tv.  This TV gives you a 70\" with amazing theater like passive 3D, with wow factor picture quality and impressive black levels for an LED, all at a reasonable price.  There is currently no other TV that can give you all that.Here's the skinny on this TV.  (reviewing 70\")- amazing black levels (not mine, terrible light blobs and flashlighting ruin black levels)- impressive picture quality- great 3D quality, with almost no crosstalk- great for games with very little input lag- LED drawbacks like flashlighting and clouding only noticeable when actual content isn't playingHere's why I love this TV.  Passive 3D is amazing.  It is so natural feeling and no strain on your eyes because your glasses are not flickering like active 3D.  Simply one eye blocks out one image and the other blocks out the 2nd image.  And as long as you are sitting up straight, and not at an EXTREME angle, you will hardly ever notice any ghosting in 3D what-so-ever.  3D on this TV looks natural, has incredible depth, and looks so smooth because of the lack of crosstalk.  If you are buying this TV for 3D, you need not be worried.The Black levels are also amazing.  I had to go back and change my review.  I initially called them very good.  I have yet to try a \"black level demo\" that has failed to impress me.  I'd now rate contrast ratio and black levels at 4.5/5 (whereas the panny flagship plasma's are 5/5).  It's damn good for an LED.As far as gaming I think the input lag is minimal.  I am no expert but one \"test\" I use for input lag is pinball games, because the lag between you hitting a button and the flipper going off is one of the easiest ways to tell how badly the screen is lagging.  And trust me, I have seen some bad lag in the past.  I played Pinball Arcade on the PS4 and the flipper response time seemed immediate.  So I was very happy.

I was trying to replace an LG 55LH90, which I consider to be the best LED TV to date. I was not thrilled with the Vizio E or M series, especially the lack of controls actually on the counsel for the Vizio M. I am not a fan of active 3D either so Sharp was not a great option. In Sharp's case, the only comparable model (70LE857U) to this Sony is actually more expensive. I have had the Sony for 3 days now. While I did see the TV in a store before purchasing, I was not instantly impressed after taking it out of the box. However, after several tweaks to the settings, this is a fabulous TV. I also purchased a Sony 3D Blu-ray with it and the family watched Epic in 3D. The passive 3D on this set is better than the theater. In all, I consider this to be a high quality TV but still not what my LG is. If you have to have a 70\" TV, then this is the one. If you simply need a large TV, then you have considerably more options in the 65\" - 75\" range and can likely find slightly better.

There appears to be one 50\" model per manufacturer, and in Sony's line-up for 2013, this is about it.  I would have purchased the upgrade KDL-55W900A in a heartbeat if it came in a 50\" package.-The picture is tack sharp and looks amazing with a high quality feed.-The ultra thin bezel is gorgeous, with screen filling the entire package.  I was able to move from an older Samsung LN46A650 and actually save an inch or two in the process!-The stand is PERFECT and it being parallel to the screen (instead of that awful round chrome one on Sony's other models) allows for precise placement of a necessary sound bar.  I use an older Sony CT-100 sound bar and it fits perfectly in front of the screen and does not intrude up into the screen so thank you Sony for making the television just high enough to clear most sound bars.-The screen is not that reflective.

Zero cross talk and amazing clarity.  Passive 3D glasses are cheap, light as a feather, and don't cause nearly as much headaches as Active 3D glasses.CONs-There is no color pop with this set.  Zero, zilch, nada.  If you want color pop, then be prepared for skin tones to suffer...I just can't find the right combinations to prevent everyone looking like they're sun baked.  There was a time when Sony skin tones were the standard for all other manufacturers.  That's not the case any longer.-Blacks are generally crushed but there is some shadow detail.-Video processing is sub par.  Lots and lots of grainy noise and I'm certain Sony says, 'Hey what did you expect for sub 1k pricing?'-Now the BIG complaint...concentrated brighter lighting in the bottom left hand corner of the screen!  Some call it flashlighting, which is exactly what it looks like.  Some reviewers on various websites state that their screens are brighter in all four corners, or in both bottom left and right hand corners but regardless, there are issues with flashlighting on these sets.  I have several weeks left before I have to decide whether to return the set to BB or not.  I was able to reduce the flashlight in the lower left hand corner by reducing the backlight setting to 2 sometimes 3, but that's a band aid solution.I'll be honest, it's a pain to return one of these large televisions only to think will the next one be worse so with flashlighting only on the lower left hand side, I'm inclined to learn to ignore it.  Sony, a little QC would go a long way to helping rebuild your storied name in consumer electronics.A couple of thoughts.  Google's informal corporate motto at one time was, 'Don't be evil.'  I don't know if Google holds true to that motto or not, but one thing is clear when reading Amazon's reviews, they take care of their customers without hassle.  In fact, look at Amazon's site as of the date of this review.  They stopped selling this model temporarily because they're concerned there are too many complaints on this television.Kudos to Amazon for using their tremendous influence to prevent hassle to their customers.My current settings:StandardBacklight 3 generally but 2 for some night viewingPicture MaxBrightness 50Color 54Hue 0Sharpness 13Color Temperature NeutralNoise Reduction LowMPEG Noise Reduction OffAdv.

The Smart TV functionality is just ok, compared to my new Samsung 60\".A great set, but a fair number of quirks.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Clouding issues, had to exchange TV", "Author": "Botgirl", "ReviewID": "R3VL9BHRUEXHEY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So, I bought this TV four days ago, and out of the box, the lower left-hand corner had very visible backlight bleeding. I called Sony, and was told to call back when I was in front of the television so they could fiddle with settings. I was clear with them that I already did that and it wasn't going to make a difference. I called back that night and described the issue (again), and was told they would send out a repairman and then someone would email me the days/times. The next day, I received a phone call from Sony asking me to email them photographs of the television rather than sending out a repair person.I was miffed, but I also realized that if I sent the photos, they might return the set and send me a new one because the lower left-hand corner clearly has an issue. This turned out to be exactly what they did. I emailed them the images and they wrote back within a few hours asking me to call them. I called them *again* and they said they would send out a new TV in the next 5-7 biz days. They took my credit card (and did a test charge against it, I see) and said that I would have to ship back (pre-paid by them) the old TV. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to disassemble this TV by myself and I'm really hoping the carrier will pick it up because it's not like I have a car or an easy way to transport 50 lb. objects. And I'm incredibly unhappy that I'm going to have to miss work for a TV delivery.But, I guess I'm pretty pleased with Sony's customer service so far. They're not at all fighting me on the issue. I'm just hoping the next set is in perfect condition.As for the set itself: even if this TV were perfect, if I had to do it all over again, I'm not sure I would. The screen is VERY glossy and reflects a ton of background lighting if you have other lights on in the room. The viewing angle is also pretty poor, although while in the store, it had the best viewing angle I could personally assess. It may just be that edge-lit LED LCD TVs (or all LCD TVs, for that matter) simply suck when it comes to viewing angle. The images on the screen itself look pretty good.I will give this TV set high marks for not having a terrible \"Soap-opera effect\" that seems to plague Samsung TVs in particular. Even with motion control on, the picture doesn't look too unrealistic when watching movies. I think I'm going to focus on that as my victory here because I cannot STAND the soap-opera effect.I think TV technology in genral is well behind the curve at this point. The quality just isn't there, and things like clouding and backlight bleeding shouldn't be acceptable. I'm glad that Sony seems to agree.I think I'll enjoy the TV for the most part when I finally get it in total working order, but I'm honestly not that jazzed by any TVs right now, and having it broken out of the box makes a large, expensive purchase demoralizing. Here's hoping OLEDs come down in price in the next 5 years and we can ditch this LED edge-lit crap.I'll post an update when I get the replacement.UPDATE:Nearly 10 days since my post. I've been calling Sony and getting stuck on hold for 20+ minutes at a time (3 times!) only to be pushed to other departments. I kept calling back, getting different answers. Finally, I was told that they can't give me a tracking number yet on my replacement TV because it takes 2 weeks to process. Um, that was new news after being told they should have a tracking number w/in 5 biz days.  I called AGAIN yesterday (8/24/13) and was told that their systems was down for maintenance and I should call back on Tuesday (!!) to find out if/what my tracking number is because they couldn't help me. How is their system down for maintenance for THREE DAYS? What? I'm getting annoyed, very annoyed.So, no replacement TV yet. This is pretty absurd.UPDATE: 9/5/2013I'm downgrading this review to a 2 star because I can't get adequately fast responses from Sony. I'm STILL waiting on a replacement. I've been posting to their Facebook page, and I'm getting near-immediate responses back saying, \"We'll get back to you\" and then they're not getting back to me. I got one yesterday saying they'd get back to me that afternoon--but no. At this point, I just want a refund. It's nearly a month since I bought this thing.UPDATE: 11/10/13I got the replacement TV sent to me by the end of September. I had the old TV shipped back to them. Sony paid for the shipping both ways. The new TV is better than the prior TV, but still has some clouding issues in the upper left-hand corner.The picture looks best with all motion control turned off--almost no \"soap-opera\" effect that way. I like the TV well enough, but I'm not blown away.BOTTOM LINE:If you have trouble with the TV, don't call Sony, just go to their Facebook page and post your complaint/concern there. You'll get the best response.I wouldn't purchase this TV again. Too much hassle for not enough TV. The viewing angle sucks, btw.

I will upgrade/update my rating if they resolve the issue.I researched a lot of TV's to replace a smaller LCD as we moved into a new house and have a fireplace that has a pre-built mount for TVs.  The selection of TVs to choose from is pretty daunting however I chose this model due to its ratings, features and most of all the fact that it has a built-in DirectTV tuner (allowing me to have less electronics in the main living area).Upon receiving the new unit around 12/6/13, I had a buddy that professionally mounts and install TV's and theater systems, mount our unit.  He 'dialed it in' real quick.  I was highly impressed with the picture.  As always, I quickly turned off the Cinemotion and Motionflow features (I still cannot fathom for the life of me why this is a default feature...).  SIDE NOTE: Turning this feature off when renting Amazon Prime movies can be done by hitting the Settings button while in the Netflix app.  After several days I noticed thin faint black vertical lines running the entire height of the screen.  They were off center, one on the right and one on the left.  You could only see them when a brighter picture was displayed.  This happened on several my Blu-ray or my DirectTV box.  I replaced cables and tried several ports for each device but to no avail. I called Amazon and they were great (as always).  They said to call Sony first in this situation and to call them if Sony would not assist.Sony had me go through the usual task of changing settings to factory defaults, power reset and cable/port swaps.  Afterwards they referred me to the product replacement people.  They sent another TV which arrived around a week and half later (the carrier they used was horrible but that is another story).  I hung the new TV.  After several days, guess what...more faint black lines.  This time, three of them running vertically (looked more like 3 mini tornadoes).  Prior to this my wife thought I was nuts as she never noticed them.  Now, I am vindicated as she too sees them.  Again, it is only when a bright scene is on the screen.I go through the same process with Sony only this time they insist on sending me a \"re-certified\" unit as I already received a new replacement.  I made my case and demanded a new one.  After supplying a Amazon receipt, they agreed.  A new unit is en-route and my fingers are crossed.  I love this TV and its picture and features and truly hope the new unit resolves my issue although I must admit I am gun shy and fear the worst.

My twin Tiffany and I were raised all over the world by our old dad, a rock and roll roadie, songwriter, wine drinker and lover off all things wonderful.

He was the best, he was the greatest and he loathed TV.He used to say there is no difference between watching the news, football, a sitcom or masterpiece theater -- you're sitting on your couch watching people in a box, who make a whole bleeping lot more money than you. Only he didn't say bleeping. That was his way of saying, go out and live your life, don't waste away your hours watching others.However, my old dad loved the movies. No matter where we were, come the weekend, he took us to whatever silver screen was closest. I can't tell you how many American movies I've seen dubbed into French and Spanish. My old dad loved a good movie.And so do I. All my life I've lived without a TV, until now. At Costco I saw this Sony Bravia 60 inch TV and I really, really wanted it. So now I have a TV.

An Edge-Lit Problem.", "Author": "WARRZONE", "ReviewID": "R1GSEDUV3FMP8G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off, this TV is capable of producing great colors and 3D. All the functions work (although you do have to wait a few seconds after starting the TV to access SEN or Netflix). The 50\" I received has horrible clouding and flashlighting on dark scenes and black bars when the room is dark. I called Sony, and they said this is perfectly normal for LED LCDs. If this is normal, I will not be buying anymore LED LCDs. I contacted the retailer about this problem and sent them a photo, and they said their floor model does not have this problem (I have a feeling their ambient lighting is too bright to see it though).All I've ever owned are LCDs (none edge-lit though), and they did not have this problem. I have a replacement set coming. If it has the same problems, I will be buying a plasma instead, since manufacturers for the most part are not making full array LED LCDs anymore. I suppose it's cheaper to replace the TVs of the people who complain rather than having a person to test them in the first place. Not many people bought the full array local dimming TVs because they were so expensive, so manufacturers gave up on them instead of further developing the technology to make it cheaper. The general public keeps buying edge-lit LCD TVs, so manufacturers have no reason to change.Bottom Line: Don't buy an edge-lit TV unless you can see and test the one you will be buying or unless you feel lucky. Edge-lit technology isn't up to par yet.Update: I received the replacement, and it is much better. There is no clouding, but there is still some flashlighting on three corners (and a tiny bit on the fourth). I will try it out for a week to see if I can live with it because I would much rather have an LCD with passive 3D than to have to baby a plasma.Update2: I decided to return it for a refund.

If you're interested in picture quality, look elsewhere. Skin tones give this set a hard time in particular.--Abysmal black levels.

Save yourself the trouble of trying to use the built-in Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu apps. The television can take several minutes to connect to your wifi network after turning it on. During this time all apps are unavailable. Once connected, expect frequent connection drops that require the TV to reboot and begin the whole process again.

I wish sony would come out and explain this to me.Brett V", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Picture, Poor Smart TV Functionality", "Author": "DStellz", "ReviewID": "R1AG06XWCX3XCF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I decided to upgrade my 46\" Samsung Smart LED TV, and this was reasonably priced and had the added benefit of 3D.Pros:The picture is great, and it's very easy to use. I like the fact the remote has a Netflix button, and there isn't a delay in the controls. The simulated 3D works surprisingly well, although I barely find myself using it truth-be-told. The glasses are comfortable and have not given me a headache.Cons:The \"smart\" features on this TV are horrible. The interface between Netflix and HuluPlus for this Sony TV is the worst I have seen. Using these apps on my other devices (PC/Xbox360/PS3/Samsung TV/Phone/Tablet) is far easier to use, and yields much better results.To give you an idea, the Netflix app fails to show me much more than my instant queue. I cannot flip through movies like I can on other devices. Instead, I have a huge grey screen, and when I scroll around it locks up and the yellow cursor doesn't line up with anything. Furthermore, it often fails to track my progress across whatever shows I am watching, and I frequently have to back out and go back into it for it to work. I never had this issue with Samsung.HuluPlus suffers from an awful interface, takes forever to find what I'm looking for, and lags like crazy. I've used it on PS3, and while still laggy (HuluPlus seems bad in general) it is nowhere near how bad it is as the Sony TV app.When the TV turns on, it takes a minute or two for it to connect to the internet and allow Netflix to open. Not a huge deal, but not common these days.I also didn't realize the extreme lack of 3D content out there. Barely any video games, channels, anything on Netflix, and I couldn't even find moderately decent 3D bluray movies in Walmart.It lacks HBOGo. This is simply unacceptable at this point. PS3 doesn't have this either, so I don't know what's going on with Sony.Final Impression:Keep an eye out for deals elsewhere. I've seen 60\" Samsung LEDs go for significantly cheaper than this. My experience with their products has proved superior to my experience with Sony. For what this TV costs, it should yield more impressive functionality than what is offered. For a device to not run Netflix properly, especially one $1300+ is unheard of when you can now spend $35 for a Chromecast or $50 for an HD Roku.My advice is to scrap your dreams of having your own personal Sony 3D theater chock full of digital media to select without additional devices. You're better off saving yourself $300+ and getting another brand, lose the 3D (and smart functionality if you so wish) and pick yourself up a 60\" Samsung/LG/Sharp.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT miracast compatible", "Author": "Peter N", "ReviewID": "R14E10NIM041TY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although advertised as such, this tv will not connect to miracast devices from other manufacturers.

As most people here, I have spent about 4 weeks solid; reviewing tv's, and stalking them as well. I have been to BB, HHREGG, as well as a few other specialty stores, and spent 2 to 4 hours in each store. (i'm retired so i can afford to do so).I have asked the sales people to insert proprietary 3d disks. The only thing that has not been possible is to attach my Xfinity/Comcast cable box to these tv's to compare the difference in picture quality.The first thing that needs to be said is that none of these stores selling said tv's have calibrated them. So some tv's that are highly rated on the internet, look terrible in the store.One example is  the Panasonic 65\" ZT Series Plasma HDTV, which was placed directly in bright lights in the hhregg store. The poor tv looked lousy and dark...Sniff.Another thing that you should know about the reviewer (me) is that I have been actively creating 3d objects and graphics for years. Resolution and color representation are so important to me.Couple this with the fact that I have light to moderate Aspergers. I can focus on microscopic details and differences for hours. Idiotic perfection of sorts. It's a blessing and a curse.The contenders we have selected for purchase (within our budget) as of today are :Sony 65\" XBR Series LED Ultra HDTVSamsung 75\" Series 7 LED HDTV - UN75F7100Sony KDL-70R550A 70-Inch 120Hz 1080pVIZIO M801d-A3 80-Inch 1080pPanasonic 65\" ZT Series Plasma HDTV.As of this writing, we have eliminated the Sony KDL-70R550A. Although it is by far the most affordable ($2100), the colors and picture quality are simply inferior to the others above.We are also probably going to eliminate the Panasonic plasma for whatever reason, the 3d was not amazing, and it's only a 65\" screen.If you mention the name VIZIO to me, I will start getting cold sweats. Although the Vizio M series affords plenty of great reviews, I still have a psychological barrier towards stereotypical cheaper brands. Quite frankly, I also have a barriers towards Kia and Hyundai, although they are great cars.I have had plenty of time to observe the vizio M801d-A3 and the Vizio M701d-A3 in action. Despite my mistrust in the brand, the picture both in 2d and 3d is excellent. Many reviewers  have said that the screen is too reflective and that there are problems operating the remote control on these models though. The screen on the Samsung 75\" Series 7 LED HDTV - UN75F7100, is also just as reflective. The color representation and picture quality of the Samsung is superior to the Vizio though.Anyone who is considering the purchase of a Sharp Aquos should definitely compare/study Vizio M models as well. Personally, I would buy the Vizio over the Sharps, I prefer the Vizios image over the Sharps, and the Sharp 80\" is very expensive too compared to Vizio. If anyone here is considering a Samsung 7100 or 8000 LED, do not even bother checking out the Vizios or the Sharp models.I hesitated a long time Over the Samsung models, and when my research was over, I invited my wife to review the results.The 3 models we studied were the Samsung 4k ultra @ 65\" and both the UN75F7100 and UNF8000 both at 75\".I saw very little picture quality difference between the UN75F7100 and UNF8000, however the 8000 series is much more expensive. For this reason we eliminated it.My wife and I have Apple Tv at home, so we are less interested in Apps and gaming. We like watching movies both in 2d and 3d.Next we compared the 4K ultra Tv's, the sony Xbr and the Samsung 4k. Both have a 65\" screen.For some odd reason we did not find the Samsung 4k impressive. We played a few Sony Demos on it as well as watched a few 3d movies on it, and It was marginally better than the Samsung UN75F7100. Also the 4k is more expensive by $2000.The 3d movies we watched were nearly just as good on the UN75F7100. We also found that the UN75F7100 had better COLOR REPRESENTATION...wait let me explain !!!The sony XBR 4K.If money were no object, I would buy the 85\" model of the Sony XBR 4 K ULTRA, right now.The sony XBR is by far the best picture quality and especially COLOR representation we have seen. By far!!!If you do not believe me, get a few 2d~3d movies you guys like, and go and force the sales people to play them on the Sony.Sony is reluctant to allow third party content to play on their demo Tv's because they want to show you their demo stuff (that looks exceptional BTW. But if you are going to spend 5k on a TV it's your right to be anally retentive.The picture quality, the perfection of color, and the passive 3d blew us away. This tv does an amazing job at up scaling content to a higher a definition of clarity and color.For me, the difference between the Sony and most of the other Tv's was like creating a picture in Photoshop at 72 pixels per inch and then creating the same picture at 300ppi, then comparing the two. Forget the fact that there is little to no real 4k content yet. This tv has by far the best picture.The huge dilemma we now have is. Which of these two tv's are we going to buy? The samsung UN75F7100 or the Sony 4K. The samsung is much larger +10\", but the Sony is better quality in picture and color.We found that the samsung UN75F7100 was not far behind in color, but there was still a visible difference. The sony image is much crisper/clearer. A higher definition, no doubt.The samsung screen is much like the vizio, extremely reflective to any object that may be in front of it.We preferred the sony's screen.Another dilemma we have is that we view tv from 12 feet away, so logically the 75\" samsung would be a better choice. Price wise they are more or less the same given a few hundred dollars.We did find the Samsungs stand quite unpractical. Due to the relatively long TV one needs two small tables at either end of the tv. We cannot wall mount it.The speakers are no doubt better on the sony which has speakers on either side of the screen. Anyhow, all these tv's warrant an added sound bar, so who cares about the original factory sound?Sony is coming out with the same tv in a few weeks without the speakers, So i may wait until I finally decide which of these two to purchase.Hope this review helps you guys choose a tv.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Netflix doesn't work", "Author": "Customer10", "ReviewID": "R2NYQ3GMT085KE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We got this TV for its smart capability.
