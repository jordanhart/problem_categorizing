{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great 60\" LCD", "Author": "Larry Sawyer", "ReviewID": "R10XR7JUJOQ5TL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched which new TV to get for several months.  I went back and forth between Plasma and LCD or LED.  I went to all the usual stores and looked at the TV's side by side, trying to figure out which picture I liked the best.  For a larger TV (bigger than 55\") I liked the Sony 60EX500 the best.  The colors looked the most natural to me.  Some of the LED sets, the colors seemed a bit too bright and exagerated.I have had the set about 5 days now, and I spent all Sunday watching TV. I watched a bunch of sports in HD. I watched some football that looked great. I watched some baseball that was so clean, it was better than being there. I watched some golf, and the details on the greens and course made me think I could read the puts as good as the caddies.I watched a couple episodes of Wild Russia with the kids, and the colors were so bright and clean, while the blacks were dark but didn't bleed at all. I even watched the 5th Element in HD, and was amazed at how great that movie still is all these years later.Overall, the picture quality is very clean and realistic.  I was very impressed with the black levels of this set as well.  To me, it had the best picture quality and features for the price.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "A lot of tv for the money.", "Author": "C. Shay", "ReviewID": "R1MDFPWQDKZGJK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did not buy this tv from Amazon.com but feel compelled to review it here. I had a five year old WEGA 60\" that was 720p but top of the line in it's day. Three months out of my 5 year extended warranty a blue haze began to appear across the bottom of the screen. I called Sony and they informed me it was the dreaded optical engine failure. I could take photos, jump through a couple hoops and they would give me a new 40\", a 46\" for $250 or this 60\" for $550.00. Once you go 60 there's no going back so it was this set we bought. It arrived very timely and so far we love it (and love those class-action law suits). I went onto the AVS Forum and found a tech who had calibrated this same set. I carefully copied all the settings and WOW! Lotsa' punchy, realistic color yet not glassy, or candy looking. Blacks are deep and various levels of black are very distinguishable. I know I made a worthwhile upgrade when I find myself rewatching all my blu-ray dvd's to catch the detail I was missing before.Only downside is sound. The old rear-projection lcd set had awesome sound. This thin model has little room for speakers and subwoofers. I have a surround sound system but will still invest soon in a small sound bar or some powered speakers for non-theater listening. Just hoping to set the record a little straighter. Sony customer service may have treated someone poorly but that shouldn't reflect on the review of this set. That's a review of their customer service. One last word. Careful calibration of any set can make a huge difference. Plan on doing it when you purchase a set.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent all over!", "Author": "Carpes, RJ, Brazil", "ReviewID": "RKXVSPY78L9PL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Brazilian version of this tv about two months ago and I just get more satisfied with it every day!

Johns \"Bobby\"", "ReviewID": "R241IKZ7MMH9QR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a sony SXRD KDS-60A200 for about 5 years and started having issues.  I called Sony for help and they said they would send me out this TV for a very small price.  It was a win/win.  I got a new TV and they get rid of some older inventory and kept a customer in the Sony family.When I read the review on Amazon before the TV came, I was expecting a big PoS TV to arrive at my house.  I gotta tell ya, the picture is outstanding, the setup was easy, more HDMI hookups than I know what to do with.  This thing is great for gaming, blu-ray and everyday HDTV use.  This years superbowl looked amazing.  If I was to do a side by side comparison of a bunch of TV's in my living room I may be a bit more critical.  If I was going from a large HQ plasma to this I may be a bit more critical.  I jumped from a 5yr old 1080p that I was impressed with to this which is awesome.  I have a big room to fill and the super plasmas and 3D TV's that are rated highly will run you about 3 - 7 grand for the same size TV.  If you have that kind of coin to drop...more power to you.  This is an outstanding TV which you can find for $1,300.00 that will still WOW your friends when they come over and serve all the mainstream technology.  Let's face it...there is really not that much in 3D at this time so I'll hold off on that technology until prices come down and it solidifies it's market position.As an added bonus...Sony's customer support became rock stars in my eyes with all their help.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Strobe light effect and Sony won't fix it", "Author": "Stephen M.

Plenty of inputs and outputs. Sound quality for built in speakers more than adequate. The colors and sharpness are not the best but in this price category cannot be beat. The picture is just a tad below that of Samsung 60\" LN60C630 LCD, but not by much. Colors are vibrant but not overly saturated and false like Sharp Quattron. Clearer picture than Sharp 60\" LCD LC-60E77UN or LC-60E78UN. I prefer LCD over plasma. The room the TV is in has a large picture window with a lot of light during daylight. The matte screen effectively reduces glare unlike many plasmas eg LG - 60PK550C. The screen is much more vivid than plasma and does not appear artificial in movies. The 120 hz motion control appears effective.The original price was $1479. Tigerdirect had a 2 day special on this unit and Amazon kept its price match guarantee(14 days). The final price including free shipping , total was $1299 for a 60\" HDTV. Cannot be beat. Amazon service is as good as brick and mortar. The set was delivered on time but was not set up as promised. Complained to customer service and was given a partial refund which resulted along with price match to the final price of $1299. However to be sure you get the price guarantee and return policy(30days from receiving they will take tv back including I believe free shipping) the TV should be bought through Amazon not a third party vendor.

I would rate this tv 8.5 out of 10", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Worst Sony TV I ever owned", "Author": "Richie Thompson", "ReviewID": "R3QDQNGX5PFTR7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a Sony BRAVIA KDL-60EX500 in Feb 2011.POOR PICTURE QUALITY!!!I wish I kept the box as I would return this thingI hope it gets hit by lightning this year.I am wondering if this CRAPPY Sony TV is supposed to SUCK compared to the Sony XBR series...I have 2 Sony XBR 52\" and they are MUCH higher quality but more money too.I can get the screen ACCEPTABLE if I don't use VIVID or STANDARD.Instead use Custom and adjust the crap out of it.It does not have the HD appearance...or come out and grab you but at least the digital noise is tamed down.I will only buy Sony XBR series for now on.I don't like that Sony don't have a USA call center anymore so my phone call gets sent to the Philippines to someone that don't speak the best English.I hope this helps someone else thinking of buying this modelRick ThompsonHumboldt, Iowa", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Look further", "Author": "James A.

Upon setting it up, I was very close to sending it back. Compared to older SONY big screen TVs,the picture quality is marginal. Not nearly as sharp or bright as my son's 60-inch 3-year old DLP SONY, and not as clear and sharp as a friends one year old SONY 55-inch LCD. The picture settings are not effective. A brightness setting above about 45% immededially fades into the white. The manual claims a setting called \"picture\" controls the contrast. It doesn't. It simply darkens the image overall. The only way to get a reasonable image is to set it toward lower brightness. The ambient light sensor must be turned off. I called Sony for help. They said install newer software downloadable from their site with a flash drive. I did. It did nothing. Also if you have older analog DVD players and surround sound, you will probably not find enogh connection points for hook up. You need everyting using HDMI. The sound is okay even though the speakers are on the backside. The TV is too heavy for one person to lift. If you want to hook up a wireless head set, forget it. The analog outputs for them cut off if you turn on a surround sound. Rapid motion smears. I would suggest you shop around for a better picture. This is not SONY's best work.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony - Poor Customer Service!!!", "Author": "Unhappy Sony Customer", "ReviewID": "R27OFVWU1LVU95", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sony has the worst customer service.  If you buy this TV you will enjoy it, but if anything goes wrong with the TV beware of the service.  I had to send the TV back because it would not turn on.  Sony agreed to send me a new TV and they said I should receive the new TV in 7-14 days.  It is now day 21 and I do not have my TV.  I have called Sony's Customer Service every day since day 15 and It takes them on average 25 minutes before I get an answer.  Every time I call they tell me the TV will ship out that day.  I just got of the phone with them (31 minutes) and they told me it will ship out today.  WOW!  The same answer for 6 days in a row.
