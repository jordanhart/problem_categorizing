{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is a great TV", "Author": "D_deU \"D. de U\"", "ReviewID": "R1GDEZY3NA6BO8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent months researching for a replacement TV in the master bedroom and finally settled on the Sony KDL32EX523. Set up was a snap - and I did it twice as I did not have a DVR in my bedroom - so I originally connected the TV directly to my Comcast cable (no box or DTA) and it was able to grab all my channels (I do not subscribe to premium services like HBO). A few days later, I added the DVR and was channel surfing in no time. (Well - actually had issues with Comcast to get their own DVR to receive their own signals, so a 1 star rating for Comcast - dang near switched to Direct TV during that process.) Adding the Sony to my wireless network was as simple as entering my network password into the TV (this model Sony has built in wireless - no need for external USB device), just like adding a computer - join the network it found, type in the password, and boom - connected. Initializing the TV to work with my Netflix account was just as simple - I logged into my Netflix account with my laptop - input the code from the TV - and boom - the TV blinked and was instantly added to Netflix. This Sony streams Netflix content better than my TIVO DVR in the other room which is right next to my wireless hub. Picture quality is great - no issues with viewing angle, no high pitched power supply sounds. I do not want to sound like a Sony commercial, but for my use, this is one great TV.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Loaded with features... with room for improvement", "Author": "Dane A. Kantner", "ReviewID": "R723CLMHRTTK7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall this is a very nice TV.  It's very thin.One of the bigger draws for me was the built in Internet Apps. I had actually returned a Vizio where nothing was working at all (Pandora literally crashed the TV) and got this. This is much better.  I've tested a few other Internet App tvs and the speed of this Sony one is probably the fastest I've seen as far as menu navigation goes. And the menu is also well laid out. For some people it might almost be too many features.The Pandora app works well. There's lots of room for improvement in how it is actually designed (there are color codes on the menu, and they only associate one with a feature--skip--why not have one associated with thumbs up, thumbs down, etc). No good visual effects. But it works for what it needs to--playing music.The Qriocity video stuff doesn't work at all. I've never seen anything played through it, or even a choice of items to play. I don't know what the deal is, but my understanding is that Sony has been hacked recently and has completely shut the service down for now. It may as well not be there.The Amazon streaming on demand works REALLY well and is high quality. If you're an Amazon Prime member there is a fairly extensive selection of titles that become free when you authenticate with your Prime account. (The entire series of Inspector Gadget!)Netflix streaming was very high quality, but would constantly stop to buffer. It doesn't buffer enough of the content. It will \"detect\" network speed as you start anything up, but obviously this detection isn't very conservative or it would downgrade my quality in favor of better playback. As it's set up now, it's unusable.You can also download software onto your computer--PC, Mac, Linux, whatever--that will let you stream video, pictures, movies, etc off of the computer and right onto your TV. Google for DLNA software and there are any number of options, many free. Windows 7 has this built into Windows Media Player but there are plenty of other open source and paid apps that may offer more features than what Microsoft's built-in software does.  It's a pretty cool feature though.The TV is aesthetically pleasing. I would say Sony has other TVs in the Bravia line that I like more, but I like this one too. And it's solid, well built.The form factor is thin. However, it's so thin that all of the ports come out back at a right angle, there is no bevel where they go in parallel to the back of the TV. Why is this an issue?  If you mount the TV on a wall you may find that your cables themselves will prohibit you from using a wall mount that's slim. I have a new LG LED TV and what they do to get around this issue is use a proprietary dongle for the cables, you hook up a tiny dongle into the port instead, then that hangs down and you hook the cables into said dongle.  No issue with mounting it very close to the wall when you have this.  With this Sony, you may have to use a tilted wall mount to give you the clearance you need, or a wall mount that leaves a few inches of room between TV and wall. Or I guess you could buy a more expensive 45 degree HDMI cable and then it would probably work with just about any wall mount.The TV has Skype built in, but you need to buy the Skype camera/mic from Sony for another $130-150 for that to work.  Out of curiosity I hooked up a Logitech USB webcam up to the TV to see if it recognized it and you could Skype with that, it didn't work. Not shocking, but good to know.I'm glad Sony has finally abandoned forcing their Memory Stick down our throats by integrating it into all of their products--no memory stick port on this TV.  There are USB ports you can use a standard USB media reader to use.The TV does split screen, and does it fairly well. I can watch my HD cable box and HD antenna simultaneously (or HD cable and computer that's hooked up simultaneously, etc); I occasionally have gotten a \"feature not supported\" when trying to tune the channel and I can't figure out what I did out of order. Split screen is a feature that some other manufacturers seem to be removing, the aforementioned LG LED I bought doesn't have it...so don't take it for granted!It only has one component input... so at the moment I have no DVD player hooked up, it's basically going to force me to upgrade to a Blu-Ray with HDMI.  The industry trend seems to be reducing the number of component inputs to 1 and increasing the number of HDMI inputs.The remote is decent. I used to really dislike Sony remotes, but this one is workable. The buttons are well laid out, well sized.  It has buttons for Netflix and Qriocity, but no Pandora and no way to reprogram any buttons.  It's not a \"universal\" remote, you can't program your stereo. I think the primary reason for this is the TV itself has built in \"synch\" capabilities to control other Sony devices such as your Sony stereo, etc., so of course if you have a full Sony line you're good but if not you'll need another remote. The TV has a feature called \"control for HDMI\" (which is branded as \"Bravia Sync\") which will send a control signal to a device through the HDMI. For the most part this only will function with Sony devices but I don't think it's necessarily closed to other devices, they just don't support it. So for example if you have a Blu-Ray hooked up via HDMI it could pause/start/play/etc your DVD through your TV's controls. It would be nice if my Comcast cable box was controllable by this, but I have a feeling I'll be canceling Comcast before they ever support this feature.The TV has a built in guide that populates over the air station information if you have a digital antenna hooked up.  It works. I didn't have to configure it for my location, it just worked. It identified the stations, and filled in the guide data.  It's nice to have a really functional guide for antenna stations as well as my cable box.One of the coolest features of this TV is its energy saving mode... The TV has a built in \"Presence Sensor\" that detects when you're not in the room for awhile and will then turn off the screen, and when you come back it turns the screen back on. It works well, and is on by default.  Will this be the next horizon in American laziness though, never turning off the TV and just relying on this feature? Who knows. :)", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good and could have been great", "Author": "M. Cohen \"Marco1\"", "ReviewID": "R2O6F4LQTEW2AQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is very good and could have been great if it were not for the crappy internet experience. The form factor itself is quite nice; very thin, light and sturdy, with a small bezel. It sets up very quickly and easily. The picture in HD is stunning: beautiful color, very sharp with very black blacks. However SD pictures are frequently fuzzy and a bit washed out which makes watching SD a drag. My 3 year old 32 inch Sony does SD much better than this one. The viewing angle is just ok. Looking straight on, the TV looks great.  As you move to the side the pictures degrades quickly. At first I thought that the sound was below average. After tweaking the settings it now sounds quite good. If you are and audiophile you will however need an amp with separate speakers. I have not had a problem with the 60 hz refresh rate. I suppose it might be somewhat of a problem if I watched more sports.  It is the internet interface which is the weakness of this TV. I have the 40EX523 with built in Wi-fi. No need for a separate dongle on this one. Loading times for most of the internet programs are quite slow - much slower than my beloved Roku box. Netflix interface is very poor. You can't search and it's even hard to see the titles of many of the movies on the screen because they are so small. The Sony Netflix picture is much worse than Netflix on the Roku box. Colors on the Sony Netflix are a bit washed out and the picture is not crisp. The Sony picture on both Hulu and Amazon seem almost as good as the Roku. Again the interface for both Hulu and Amazon is far worse than that of the Roku. Crackle is not even worth using. It takes forever to load, then has to keep re-loading despite fast internet download speeds. It's almost impossible to get back to where you left off on a movie. It operates so poorly that I am amazed that Sony includes it in the first place.  They should make it work well or get rid of it. I would recommend buying this TV without internet connectivity (40EX520) and don't bother with the severely overpriced internet dongle. Do yourself a favor and buy a Roku box for $79 and use that for the streaming of TV shows and movies. It is far superior to anything that Sony has to offer on this TV. Sony engineers should study the Roku box and interface and use what they learn to improve this rather pathetic internet offering. Other than the internet, this really is a very good, satisfying TV.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it.", "Author": "Dreamspinner", "ReviewID": "R3H1TI9RBVVPEC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this model. I have it in my bedroom and the picture is large, sharp, and easy to see regardless of ambient light conditions from bright sunlight to total darkness. I especially love the internet ready feature since I am a great fan of Netflix. No extra box or plugs needed--just WiFi. I use the handy bright red Netflix button on the TV's remote which takes me there in one step. The Netflix search function on the screen is not easy to maneuver through categories, however, so I keep it simple by staying in my \"instant queue\" to find something to watch. I bought the TV from Amazon because it had the best price and I knew the model, but I have to admit I was worried about buying and shipping such an expensive item. All was good--the TV arrived quickly with perfect packaging intact. No worries.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Got TV for DLNA, NETFLIX, etc..., but these aren't very good", "Author": "GI", "ReviewID": "R1E8YU4V3XO8TK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this TV to be hung on a wall for a workout, Workbench area.  Since It is being hung I didn't really want to have boxes hanging from the TV on the floor etc... so for me it seemed the Sony EX523 would fit the bill: Wireless Network connection, DLNA (to connect to my media music, videos, pictures, etc...) and connection to Pandora, Netflix, et all.The good:1.  The TV picture was very nice, matched or exceeded the Samsung sets2.  Customer service knowledgable and helpful on getting and setting up MAC filteringThe Bad:1.  Sound, but then again I know ALL TV's sounds now suck, that is the new corner to cut2. Setup to wireless with MAC filter was difficult to know how to setup and required call to Customer service3.  Wireless kept dropping for a very short period of time, but it would create issue with the DLNA and netflix.The really BAD:1.  You need to setup an account with Sony to be able to use their apps, i.e. NETFLIX requires to go online and setup an different account than the Netflix account (NO OTHER TV requires something like that).  Remember SONY seems to have the inability to product consumer's information (not once but twice wihtin a SHORT period of time) so creating an account is a risky prospect.2.  DLNA is essentially worthless it basically only support MPG, MP3 and JPG,3.  DLNA has NO SUPPORT FOR AVI, AAC, etc...Update:Returned the Sony TV for a Samsung UN40D6300 (I had a wireless USB connector from another TV set that I hard wired.), so this got my wireless connection.The Samsung had tons of pixel issues 8 always on and about 20 dead pixels, tv returned and trying the third one (same samsung.)What ever you want to say about the TVs the on thing I will say is Amazon's return policy for the wireless and the pixel issues was amazingly nice (wish I didn't have the issues in the first place).", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works great, easy set up, great picture", "Author": "S.

I have a strong bias toward Sony, so take that into consideration.  This TV was easily set up, including connecting it to our wireless internet network, and setting up our Netflix account on it.  Now we can directly watch movies from our \"Instant Queue\" on Netflix on the TV, with no wires. The picture is great, the controls intuitive.  We are just starting to utilize the other functions, but for a basic viewer who wants to watch movies this is a good solution.  I am very happy with the TV and would recommend it.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does the job, looks good (1 week in, w/6 month update)", "Author": "Shakypete \"P.\"", "ReviewID": "R3JRGEXANEGH5Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture is pretty good.  I am waiting for a HD receiver to arrive to give a final verdict.  I'll update at some point.  Tomorrow the wall mount arrives.  I like that it is less than 1.5 inches thick.  Should look nice on the wall.  The BX420 and others from last years Sony line really disappoint there.  EX523 is also only 17 pounds on the wall, which makes for a minimal load on the wall mount.I know it is only 60Hz.  That doesn't matter to me.  I did not plan on 3D or HD sports of any importance.My biggest positives are the volume control, off-axis viewing and color quality.It is has very fine volume increments at the low end.  Great for night time TV in bed.  The Off-axis viewing has minimal drop-off.  Viewing alternatives in Best Buy led me to give Sony a shot. In there, they seemed to have this down, with earlier models, so I figured this one would work out well.My kids really like it over the 15 inch standard def LCD it replaced.  Now they can read the on-screen Guide.I didn't calibrate it.  But in that line of thought, I don't like that it only has three picture modes.  Normal, Vivid, and custom.  I typically use \"Movie\" mode on both of my Samsung's, and it serves me well.  I am stuck in Normal for now.  Another minor annoyance, I didn't find any good instructions for how to put the stand together.  I figured it out, but some better directions would have been nice.No idea if the Stereo is working.  I cannot tell.  But I do like the pair of 10 Watt speakers.  They deliver.  The 5 watts of my Samsung 22 inch TV is a joke.No noisy PSU issues, like another reviewer indicated.  I really hope he took it back.It also looks really nice.I like the internet connectivity.  Integrated Wifi made it easy to update firmware.  I don't really need the features, they just came along for the ride.  I may try and use the DLNA support with my media server, at some point.  It isn't a priority right now.  I chose this TV for the expected picture quality based on looking around Best buy at competitors.(Updated 17Nov2011 below is all new)I got the HD cable box about 5 months ago. I am very happy with this TV. The image quality is still very satisfying!Biggest positive observation for this 6 month update was the sound. Searching through the features, I stumbled upon an audio setting for being wall-mounted. It does something to improve the reflected audio, and it really does help. I can't explain it, but it does. Stereo is also more noticeable, vice what I said above.Biggest disappointment for this 6 month update, the sleep feature is really clunky to get to. Every other TV I have owned, \"Sleep timer\" was a button on the remote. Not on this one. It is like 7 or 8 software clicks to get to it, and 5 more to set it to the 120min that I like. At 32 inches, it is a good bedroom TV candidate, but this feature is really annoying.I tried the internet features a couple months ago. I don't have any accounts with the services offered to provide any good feedback. I tried the free movie service mentioned by another reviewer, it is really that slow to navigate, and it got really annoying, really fast. Resume feature stunk. Video playback was acceptable, when I found one I liked.Sony provided 4 firmware updates to the TV since it was originally released (when I bought it). No idea if it improved any of the web features, but release notes for all of them mentioned internet features as the main improvement. One of them provided Skype support, if you have the Sony Camera that matches the TV frame. I guess it looks cool since it matches the bezel of the TV, and it is a neat idea for some. I don't think it will ever be needed in my bedroom, that isn't my thing. It would probably be great if I put this in my kitchen, as I like to Skype to my family during breakfast when I'm on travel for work. But I do it via a desktop PC for now. If I ever move it to the kitchen, I may reconsider.The picture is still amazing. I still don't see the \"Significant\" light drop-off others claim is there when viewed off axis. I also noticed many others stating saying the USB wi-fi dongle works. What are you talking about!?! The TV's WiFi antenna is built in 802.11N! I think they are reviewing the wrong Television.I still haven't tried the DLNA support. It just isn't a priority. Maybe one day. I like knowing it is there, and I have quite a collection to stream to it. I have yet to set up my PC as a DLNA server.Verizon FiOS finally updated their on screen display, it looks amazing on this TV. Widescreen, and easier to read than its SD predecessor, but I credit the TV with providing the 1080p, to make it look crisp!PSU buzz, well Yes, if I get my ear within 2 inches of the TV, when it is powered down, it does have a slightly audible buzz. I have really good hearing (tested every year for work), and it takes that sort of proximity to notice it. I still think the other reviewer got a bad unit. I happened to notice it on a day when no one else was in the house, otherwise it is always too noisy to hear it during the day, and inaudible from 10 feet away while I'm sleeping.I'm still very satisfied with my purchase. I do like Sony products, as I have a good track record with them over the last 15 years. Only two minor problems with approximately 25 products of all types. My first Sony TV is still going strong. My second Sony AV receiver burnt out the center channel after 9 years (which was long enough for me). For my third Sony AV receiver I was happy to purchase a top of the line model to replace it. The original one is still working... My Second Sony TV had a bad speaker, that I never noticed until 6 years later, because it was hooked up to my AV receiver the entire time. I'm guessing it was broken when I got it, and would have been under warranty, if I ever noticed it. I have had several Toshiba televisions, and Samsung TVs, I still prefer Sony, but I'm willing to buy any major brand that I like the User interface, and image quality.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best TV we've owned!!!", "Author": "Paul D.

Yes, I too was worried about the 60hz engine, however, they've figured something out as we have no blur in sports or fast action scenes.  The TV does as advertised and boots quickly.  The Netflix viewing only the Queue was annoying at first since my PS3 allows me to search.  I basically added more to my queue on my laptop which is much faster anyway.  Can't see any problems with this unit and it's the third 40+\" TV I've owned.  Also, the base is really solid and swivels smoothly.I was not impressed by the shipping!  They called me to reschedule two times.  The TV was supposed to be here on a Friday. They called to reschedule for Monday. Monday, they called to reschedule for Tuesday.

I have had eight Sony televisions prior to purchasing the Bravia KDL32EX523.  I was VERY disappointed with this TV and I returned it to Amazon.  The picture had an overall magenta cast, even when I turned chroma all the way down (to black and white).  Reds were magenta (ever see a magenta Coca Cola can?)  If I adjusted color toward green to \"correct\" the red deficiency, the yellows went greenish.  The picture also lacked snap.  Colors were washed out.  Flesh tones were not natural.  Highlights tended to bloom, losing detail in highlight areas (like faces).  Adjusting brightness, contrast, backlight didn't help.  Could never get a satisfying picture.Also, the audio quality was poor, no decent lows or highs.  Just mid-range.  The remote control was very difficult to use, too difficult to navigate.  The printed instruction manual was very inadequate, basically dealing with initial installation and setup.  Everything else was on-screen.

No complaints there.Viewing angle is pretty narrow; you don't have to move far to either side before the picture gets washed out. But I usually watch straight on, so not a big deal.The integrated WiFi is a nice feature, mainly for watching NetFlix without having to hook up a computer or PS3.But there are a couple of really disappointing things I can't overlook.The worst thing is that the T.V. emits is a high pitched whine or buzzing sound constantly. And when I say \"constantly,\" I mean EVEN WHEN YOU TURN IT OFF! Actually, I think the reason the noise doesn't stop is because you can't really turn the T.V. \"off;\" when you hit the power button, it just goes into \"standby.\"  So if this is a bedroom T.V. and you want to turn it off and go to sleep, that means you have to get up and go over and pull the plug unless you are hard of hearing or can sleep through the noise it makes all night. If, like me, you have it mounted to the wall and plugged into an outlet hidden behind the T.V. itself, you're screwed.Another annoying thing is that the PC video input is on the side of the T.V., but the PC audio input is on the back (so you cannot easily connect your PC with one of those cables that has a 15-pin video and a stereo mini plug in the same cable). To mock you further, the designers did actually put a mini-jack right next to the PC input, but THAT mini-jack is not an input, it's an output (for headphones).I wanted to give this T.V. a higher rating, because the picture and sound quality aren't bad, but I expect better design decisions from Sony, and a T.V. that goes silent when I turn it off.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Had one issue but the picture is great", "Author": "JoeBrown \"ToolGuy\"", "ReviewID": "R3BZZJWPKTAW20", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this Sony Bravia after getting the Sony Google TV earlier this year at Target for another room.The picture is great on this TV.

After paying the \"early adopter premium\" on a Sony Grand WEGA in 2004, I'm happy to report it is still running strong and has never had a single problem. The sustained long term performance of that television led me to Sony and the Bravia KDL40EX523 when the time to update the primary television in our house...a 10-year old behemoth with rapidly degrading picture quality and a giant 25\" CRT picture tube that screamed \"20th century throwback\".If you were an early HDTV and flat screen adopter: you'll be delighted at the drop in price and increase in performance in the current choices on the market.  For this television, easy basic operations are supplemented with a range of Internet-enabled functions that expand its overall entertainment value (or time-wasting opportunities, depending on your point of view).Set-up was relatively easy. Assembly consisted of a three-piece base/post/rear bracket that secured easily with five screws. This can be done by one person, but you'll be happier with a helper. When I applied power for the first time, the television went through a brief self-test, followed by a menu-driven set-up routine consisting of on-screen menu items that you select with the remote. Following this, it took about 20 minutes to index the available channels and programming data from my provider (while waiting for my cable company's DVR to arrive in the mail, I tested this TV with direct input from the coax).The television's integrated WiFi immediately recognized and connected to the router (it will also connect via ethernet, which I did not try).This television is outstanding in what matters most: picture quality and ease of operation. HD programming is as vivid as you would expect it to be, and SD programming is also crisp. Sound quality won't be confused with anything coming from high-end speakers, but is perfectly acceptable. The controls on the remote are intuitive and nicely labeled.Most of the default settings for sound and picture were perfectly acceptable, and should require minimal adjustments for all but the most obsessive tweakers. I'd avoid the \"simulated 3D\" option, which mostly adds a buzzy echo.Among the Internet-enabled features are single-button access to Netflix. Additional menus provide access to many popular other Internet services, including YouTube Pandora, Slacker Radio, Hulu, Amazon video, Facebook, Flicker, Skype, Twitter...and any other site you want to view via an integrated browser). If you have a smart phone, you can install Sony's media remote application. While its usefulness as a remote control is basic, its best feature allows use of your phone's keyboard while doing searches of online content: far easier than navigating through the OEM remote's point-select of an alphanumeric menu.Video/audio quality in the applications I use (Netflix, Pandora and Flicker) were fine. Obviously the network carrying these services will have a large influence on their quality and responsiveness.Flicker is accessed via a family of Yahoo-driven \"widgets\", some of which work better than others. The Weather widget and Flickr widgets both work very well. There are nearly 200 others available (and the majority seem to be apps for local TV news markets).This television also immediately recognized and was able to access local media available via DLNA media server (enabled in a Buffalo Technology NAS device.Finally, if you are using this television with other late model Sony components connected with HDMI cables: the components integrate well with each other. This unit receives inputs from a recently purchased  Sony AV receiver and Sony Sony Blu-ray player. The receiver power and input functions are automatically synchronized with the television options for programming source and sound (TV or external speakers). Very nice.While nobody can tell how long a piece of electronics will last, it's always a good sign when they work well out of the box, and this television has done just that.Exercise its advanced network/Internet-enabled functions, will require some comfort with LAN configurations and media server set-up (if you are doing local streaming).The printed user guide included has minimal information on set-up and functions.

The difference between my old one and this is that this one has Edge LED Backlight and internet connectivity.  Because I read the previous reviews, I was prepared before the set arrived.  I bought a CAT 7 LAN cable in case I had to hardwire it, but I wanted to try wireless first.  The wireless works great for me, but then I have a Linksys maximum performance dual band N router.  The TV uses the 5.1ghz band while my computers and printers use the 2.4ghz band simultaneously.  I set the router up first with WPA-2 security and my chosen SSID and Security key.  DO NOT use the WPS setup even though this router has the capability.  What happens when you do, is the router generates a random set of security keys and then you have to go back and reconfigure all your other stuff so they will work.  Choose the manual configuration and scan for and select your network SSID, then input your preset security key. Boom - Done.  My cable modem and router are in a stand with my cable box, dvd, blu-ray, etc. about 3' below the wall mounted TV.  So far the streaming movies work well, and I would not expect then to all be free.  I bought the router and Sony Wireless LAN adapter refurbished and saved a chunk of money.  I do this frequently because they are TWICE BAKED as far as factory inspections go.I also was disappointed with the sound at first, but I went to the sound setup and selected the surround sound feature and adjusted the treble - bass so everything became clear as a bell.  Best TV sound I ever had.  I also have some Sony wireless headsets that have built in DTS and Dolby Digital decoders.What can I say about the picture.

I have honestly never seen a picture so sharp and colors so vivid. 1080p is well worth it.There are only two cons that I can think of.

I don't watch a whole lot of TV or even movies. 90% of the entertainment I watch is off the Internet, everything else is local stations I can get over the air. I could care less about the speakers and refresh rate.I use WPA2 AES on my WiFi network. I was eventually able to get this TV to connect but it was a pain. First, I had to enable SSID broadcasting. Even once I did get the TV to connect, if I made my network private again, the TV would lose the connection which is stupid since once it knows the name of the network to join, this shouldn't be an issue. I'd rather not have to broadcast my SSID but now I have no choice. Not even manually entering an IP address, subnet mask, gateway, etc. helped.Second, in order to get the TV's MAC address, you have go into the network settings. It's not on the box anywhere. This means when you first setup the TV, you'll have to cancel out of the WiFi setup to get to where the MAC address is and then go back and setup WiFi.Of the 20+ devices that span every manufacturer I've used, this is the only one I had to modify my WiFi setup to get it to connect. I'm sure if you use WEP (which is a joke) it'll work fine.Another complaint is that it takes about a minute for the TV to \"warm-up.\" Not in the traditional sense but for the remote to start communicating with the TV. More than likely when the TV first powers-up, the processor is busy with task like checking for updates, etc. and it doesn't respond immediately to things like changing channels and displaying the guide. This a bit of GUI oversight on the testing team's part.After a month, the right speaker started making a loud clicking noise even when the TV was turned off and all cables were disconnected. I called Sony Service on a Sunday the same day their web site was down and a big game was on. None the less, the service rep was very polite and patient and gave me a couple of options after we tried some troubleshooting. At the end of the call, I realized the clicking was feedback through the AC outlet and when I turned off a light in another room, it stopped!Also, beware, you have to have Hulu Plus to use Hulu on this TV.

I decided that a serious upgrade in size was needed and I was very attracted to the on-board Internet connection and built-in wifi.  I was not only not disappointed, I have been thrilled to pieces (with just one minor glitch that I'm sure will be resolved).  Set up was extremely easy.  I purchased the Sony Home Theater Sony HT-CT150 3D Sound Bar System to enhance the sound quality and the two products sync together.  The TV and all components (cable box, DVD, and even my iPod) connect through the subwoofer, which serves as a switching box, so there is only a single cable going into the TV.  With Bravia Sync you can control the sound system with the TV remote. I still have to switch channels when watching through cable with the cable remote.The HD picture is nothing short of astounding.  Really beautiful, sharp, clear, vibrant.  Watching nature shows and movies on this set is a revelation.  Movies look fabulous, and in my apartment-sized living room, the size of the screen makes you feel like you're in a screening room.  I will have very little need to ever pay movie theater ticket prices again.The one glitch so far is that I can't seem to get the streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon) to play through the sound system.  I suspect that I will need to get on line with Sony customer service to fix this.  Also, one of my HDMI ports had a somewhat loose connection and the screen would periodically back out for a fraction of a second.  I fixed this by switching ports and now it is fine.Edit on 10/5:  I solved the sound system issue for my Netflix and Hulu streaming apps.  It was a matter of making sure the HDMI cable from TV to subwoofer was as firmly connected at possible.  I did that and now I can not only watch all the streaming services I subscribe to, but they sound just great through the external speakers.This is an excellent TV that I highly recommend.  It's very interesting, also, that five years ago, when I bought my first flat screen HD TV, a 26\", I paid about $250 more than I just paid for this TV on Amazon.

I've read almost every review on CNet and Amazon. My goal was to find a solid TV with Internet Apps - as lately all we do is streaming Netflix and don't watch cable TV at all. My choice eventually narrowed to Google TV an this Sony Bravia EX52.Google TV (also produced by Sony) - seemed perfect, offering much more flexible platform - pretty much as open to content as any computer hooked to Internet, better browsing and convenient remote with keyboard  - it still left an impression of a Beta version. Plus it doesn't work with Skype (yet). Bravia has its own hardwired set of available applications, but the choice of them was exactly what I wanted. Skype ended up to seal the deal.It arrived in perfect condition and even one day earlier (and it is around Xmas time).Hooking it up took less than an hour.I have read complaints that process is a bit confusing (in particular - Netflix). System forces you to register on Sony site with the code, that TV provides (appears on its screen automatically) and then the site connects your TV with your Netflix account (with another code, that you get on Sony site). Although it seems complex - in reality it takes literally two minutes and under no condition this should be a subject to purchasing decision. It took me a few minutes in the most distracting conditions - my kids were all over TV and me like a bunch of monkeys. If I could do it easily - anyone can.The other concern that I knew about when purchasing - is inconvenient remote  - in particular the way of characters input. And this is indeed a weakness, Sony should do something about it. I said earlier that hooking it up took less than an hour - most of this time was taken by trying to find \"_\" character of my Skype login.But in general for me it is not an issue - I am one of those who was quickly texting on old fashioned cell phones way before T9 dictionaries, so putting in characters through the number pad is something I can live with, plus you don't do it often. Otherwise navigation is totally friendly.All in all I am one very happy customer. Works beautifully.

There are so many choices out there and yes, you can find another TV that is cheaper but you will not get the quality from a cheaper TV like you have in this one. This TV was replacing an HDTV that I purchased from Walmart and I had decided that I wanted an led 60h TV. I have chosen this TV because it has plenty of hdmi ports (4 to be exact) and what I also like about this TV is that it has a headphone jack,hdmi port, and USB on the left side of the TV. This comes in handy if you use turtle-beach headsets because you can just plug the headphones right into the headphone jack and power it with the USB jack right next to it and that's it. Also what I have learned about this TV is that if you have a PlayStation 3 and you turn it on, the TV will recognize the PS3 and change the channel for you to your PS3. I thought that was cool because it just saves you the extra time not having to turn the channel yourself. The sound is OK, but you can hook up external speakers if you would like better sound. If you're in a small room a mini surround sound system (or computer speakers with the small sub-woofers) would be nice with this TV because if your in a small room, you can just plug the speakers into the headphone jack on the side and that's it, better sound. I have not tried the Internet apps yet, but I can assure you they would work fine and the menu/guide interface are smooth and functional. I also like the fact that it has a sensor on the TV that detects motion/non motion and will turn off the display if there is no movement but the speakers will still be on, and if its no movement for a longer period of time, the TV will completely turn off. The only reason I did not give this TV five stars is the stand that came with the TV. When I hooked up the TV, the stand was slightly under a 90 degree angle and it says in the instructions that you can tilt the screen slightly back. The instruction was right, you can tilt the screen back but the stand can swivel and if you turn the TV, the TV will tilt back down. You can remedy this by wedging something behind the TV but if I paid this much money, I would expect the construction of the stand to be a little better. It also sits kinda low and I would have liked it to sit a bit higher, but this is just a preference thing. Also the remote is a little too bulky and large and I guess they weren't worried about ergonomics when they made this remote because it could be compare to the dimensions of a brick without the weight. Overall, this TV is a good buy, yes, it is a little pricey for a 32 but you get what you pay for and that is quality out of this sony bravia. Also, I can actually say I have a sony bravia now lol, this tv is definately worth it, just hit the buy now button.

I'll base my review by different categories and give the pros and cons of each. I have only had this tv for 2 days so far so this will be more or less an out of the box impression.Look and Style of TV and Stand: (5 stars)  Pros  - All black and sleek design looks pretty good  - doesn't feel cheap  - stand rotates  - has a hole in the stand it to screw to the tv stand (optional)  - very thin  Cons  - the stand seems flimsy, if you nudge the tv a bit the tv will shake so the stand doesn't seem to make it very sturdy, nonetheless it seems to hold the tv without too many problemsRemote: just about your average remote with some shortcuts (3 stars)  Cons  - does not have a keyboard or any feature that will easily allow for typing into the internet browser or searching things  in the internet appsPicture Quality (4 stars)  Pros  - picture seemed brilliant ( I don't have HD channels, but I connected my laptop to it and played a Blueray movie in 1080p and it looked amazing)  - I have heard on CNET reviews about how some backlit TVs don't have good black levels, but this TV has some very dark black levels  - screen seemed to be uniform throughout, no patches of brightness or darkness  Cons  - standard videos and channels (320p, 480p) did not look good at all.  - I watched my basic tv channels and they looked stretched and blurry  - only has good picture quality for HD vidoes  - the standard channels seemed to have double visionInternet Apps: ( 2.5 stars)  Pros  - plenty of video and music apps  - has the standard apps like hulu plus, netflix, crackle, youtube, dailymotion and others  - has an internet browser  - some of them do play in hd which looks really good  Cons  - doesn't have an app store, or a way to get more apps  - youtube and crackle are the only free video apps  - all the other video apps require a paid service, or pay per view, or rental service  - there is no standard and free hulu, only hulu plus  - I can't seem to get an option in youtube to play in HD, so I'm guessing they don't have it  - doesn't play youtube movies  - browser is really slow and seemed pointless without a mouse  - the keyboard used to type into the search is similar to a keyboard seen on old phones that have abc on the number 2, def on 3, and so on.  - There doesn't seem to be a point in having Internet TV if it doesn't really have good free apps, a good browser, or an app storeSound (3.5 stars)  Pros  - plenty of customization options for sound  - seemed clear  Cons  - didn't have deep base, although it is expected with a thin displayConnections  Pros  - has 4 HDMI, svga, audio in, component, etc.  - has usb  Cons  - could not figure out how to open up usb files and movies, couldn't find it in the manual  - could not get it to set up with my home networkI hope they come out with a software update for this TV because the internet apps could definitely use an upgrade.

As a film maker I am critical of picture quality, contrast, definition in blacks, and color rendition which are all excellent.  We noticed a lot of reflections in the Samsung sets. With many windows in our family room we were worried about reflections on the flat panel. The Sony's flat panel does a very good job of muting reflections.  The set is easy to set up.  An excellent on screen guide helps one set up the picture, sound and wifi.  The price was more than Vizio and LG but you get what you pay for.CON - Sound quality - the speakers in the thin set put out poor quality sound. That seems to be a problem with all LED/LCD sets. A sound bar is recommended, we have a sound system.Sony needs to work on the registration process, it is very difficult to link the set to the online services Sony provides.

Checked around though and was told that only the larger newer tv's have more component connections.-Sound is fine for me, but I have never been big on whether or not I have surround sound.  Just bought the 32\" sony sound-bar though for about $210, since my husband is.Love:-the screen is beautiful-it is lighter then the much smaller LCD flat screen tv it replaced-love the wi-fi and connection to our computer.  I have Amazon prime and it is nice to watch the free tv shows, as well as watching all of the digital content I had previously purchased on Amazon.  I have TIVO's and you have to go to your computer to download your shows to your tivo.  With this computer, you pick the show you want to watch right off the tv, no need to go to your computer and tell it to download.  Very cool.  It also lets you watch netflix and other programs, but since I already had TIVO, this wasn't a big deal.the 30 day return policy Amazon has.  It allowed me to take the risk and purchase this sight unseen.

I did actually look at other TV's and seriously considered 3-D or Plasma TV's, but there are just too many \"if's\" out there; direct sunlight on your plasma can make life difficult, and I really do not like the idea of wearing Elvis Costello glasses all of the time.

Laricheva \"book worm\"", "ReviewID": "R2D5RJX1AZFKNC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The main reason I bought a Bravia tv was to play video (.mov) files I shoot on my canon for work. The tv claims to be able to read video off a usb card. Turns out it does play movies off a usb... but only when you convert them first to an mpeg1 or an mpeg2 format. This takes a while and I find it to be misleading advertising since I'd assume that I can play anything off a usb directly with out conversion (which takes a while). That is a huge draw back for me as a video/design professional. I'm happy with the resolution though, although there is a thin black bar on top of the screen when ever it plays Netflix that no one (judging from other reviews) can get rid of either. Some of the films are pixelated and of course most content off youtube is pixelated as well (but thats not Bravias fault). The navigation/menus through out the applications is a bit clunky. It's very difficult to surf the web on it unless one has a keyboard. It does skype but I need to buy another camera for it that's another 100 bucks. I really wish I purchased a samsung since their tvs can play ANYTHING off of a usb stick and... even a memory stick off the computer.  I think it's a misleading claim to say that they can play movies off of a USB. Disappointed.

The problem we had was with the delivery.  Of course we accepted the free delivery offer from Amazon.  Had we known how it would turn out we would have happily paid to have a more convenient delivery.  The TV was shipped to some place about 100 miles south of where we live.  Delivery was promised to us on June 9th.  The company that received the TV and was supposed to call us and arrange delivery.  They did call us on June 3rd and left a message which consisted of 10 minutes of canned music followed by the message to call them and arrange delivery.  Of course when we heard 2 minutes of the 10 minutes of canned music when we played back our messages we like most folks just ignored it and went on to the next message.  On June 5th we checked online to see the status of the delivery.  It said a message was left and that they were expecting some sort of action from us.  It occurred to us then that perhaps that music message was the message we didn't receive.  So we listened to all 10 minutes of the canned music and sure enough at the end of it they left a phone number to call but of course they left it so fast we couldn't get it all so we got the pleasure of listening to 10 more minutes of canned music in order to confirm the phone number to call.  What a delight.  Since they were not open on Sunday we called them early on June 6th.  We were told that the earliest they could deliver the TV was June 16th, a week later than promised by Amazon.  They offered us the option of driving 4 hours round trip to pick it up but we realized that that would cost us about as much in gas as paying for delivery in the first place.  At last on the 16th more than an hour late the TV was delivered.  The delivery guys were very nice and even helped me set up the TV.  We are patient people and in the end we were very happy with our purchase.
