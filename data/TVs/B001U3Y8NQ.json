After having purchased a Samsung 46\" model A650 I signed up for Direct TV satellite but could not get the same programs (HD) on my old bedroom set. I didn't want to spend a lot of money so I started tracking Amazons listings. Long story short. it's everything I wanted in a second set. The picture is perfect, the price was right with no tax or shipping charge. Excellent clarity. Love this set.

Relatively thin so perfect for wall mounting and the picture is excellent. While not up to the LN52A650 by Samsung (and nothing really is) for the price you will not find a better picture than this set. The menu's are easy to navigate. Operation is flawless and with 3 HDMI inputs its got plenty for most applications. This set is less in cost than the 550 model mainly because it doesnt have the side inputs which for me i dont use in the bedroom and would rather save the $100 or so odd dollars. If you wanted them later you could easily run a wallplate with them to a another location which actually makes for a cleaner install. Samsung is the best picture out there and is worth a few extra dollars. I fully expect many years of trouble free service from this set as thats been my experience with this brand. Also register online for their warranty and they add 3 months to the end of it at no cost just for signing up. Would buy this set again.", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "R.

The colors and picture is amazing especially if you are going to watch tv and movies with it. One downside is that they seem to have a high chance of having Backlight Bleeding(parts of the screen are brighter or lighter than others) but that common with all LCD tv's.NOW WITH THAT ALL SAID!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS TV IF YOU PLAN ON USING IT FOR GAMING!!!!!!!!That is exactly why I purchased this tv, it has such great reviews because most people use it for movies or tv, for that its fine BUT NOT FOR GAMING!. I got this TV for Christmas and I am now currently returning it because it just cant play games. DONT LET THAT GAME MODE FUNCTION FOOL YOU...IT LITERALLY DOES NOTHING.The problem with is is that it has SEVERE ghosting..meaning if your playing a game (especially FPS) and you move with any speed at all the images double up so it looks really blurry. Especially in dark (dark as in, in the game dark) rooms.For example if you are playing rock band and your singing or something and the words are scrolling on the screen, they are EXTREMELY blurry and will give you a headache in no time.Again if your not planning on using it for games this tv will do ABOVE AND BEYOND what you need.

The picture quality is  very good with a couple, minor exceptions.  Even though the TV comes with a \"set\" normal, picture, I'm still learning to adjust it for even better picture (color on faces too much I feel).  After 2 weeks viewing I still haven't called in cable company to \"set up\" and give me HD.This tells how much I'm satisfied now with the set. The only thing I don't like is the remote dosen't have the \"main\" buttons in consumer friendly position.  ie. the mute buttom, the change back channel button are somewhat hidden when they should be put in a easy position on remote.

Crisp Image.  Poor internal speakers", "Author": "Chris H", "ReviewID": "R17Q84TCYQT84X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd Samsung LNXXB530 TV.  I think Samsung nailed it with this TV line.  Everytime someone walks into my house and watches either tv, they end up telling me how great of a picture it is.  I watch plenty of football and basketball, and have never felt the desire to go buy a 120Hz tv after owning either of these.  I could not vouch for hockey, but there is never a \"tail\" on the football or basketball.The picture is bright and crisp, but the internal speakers are no good.  The first Samsung we purchased was hooked straight into a surround sound system so we never even checked how the internal speakers worked.  The second (the LN37B530), was hung in our bedroom, where we did not have an external speakers to plug into.The internal speakers don't handle high bass or treble very well (so don't try to blast your ears off during an action movie with it) but are suitable for watching everyday TV.  In our bedroom, since the walls are closer in, the reverberation helps move the sound around.  Just to make sure we didn't have a faulty TV we unplugged the first TV from the surround sound to test its internal speakers.  In our larger living room, they performed miserably.  With no close walls for sound to bounce off of, the sound performance is no good.I would not buy any flat screen (LCD, Plasma, LED, or other) for its internal speaker performance, they are all probably no good.  This TV has a GREAT picture and is great for any tv, movies, or sports you may watch.CEVA SHIPPING NOTE:On a side note, the company AMAZON.COM used to ship this TV was CEVA.  CEVA was HORRIBLE.  I began calling CEVA the day the order was due, and had to hassle them to get my tv to me 4 days late.  They lost track of my shipment (didn't know if it had unloaded on a dock or was still on a truck) for those 4 days.

I haven't upgraded my cable service to HD yet but it looks great as is.  120hz is obviously better but the 6ms refresh rate compensates well.  There are some better features out there but to me it seemed like the law of diminishing returns.  I could spend an extra $300 or $400 but not really notice any better picture quality.I had a good experience with the delivery.

The shippers brought it in and would have set it up for me, but we declined since the old set was not out yet. The set is great for us. Only needed my husband and I to set it up. It was much harder getting the heavy old set out and on to a new home than getting this one in! It was relatively easy to set up and we had the whole thing done in less than an hour. The picture quality is great, much easier for us to watch from the kitchen which is about 40' away, though it is always preferred to relax on the sofa.  We don't use this set for any gaming, just for movies and watching. For this, it is great and we can still close it away in the cabinet when I don't want to have the look of the TV in the room.

After shopping around, the sales reps we spoke to consistently rated the Samsung LCD Tv's as the best available.  I have been a long time customer of Amazon.com, satisfied with the company's service, pricing and shipping practices.  However, in this instance, I was decieved when checking the specifications before buying.  Here's what happened.  The store sales reps I spoke with agreed that the 120Hz version of the same TV provides better viewing than the 60 Hz version.  So, when checking specs on the Samsung I bought, I was looking for the 120 Hz version.  The Amazon webpage listed all the features the of the Samsung I purchased.  However, and this is where the deception occurred, I read through the list of specifications.  In every instance but one, the features were listed in bold print on the left side of the screen, except, including the Hz feature.  In this case the feature was listed as 120Hz in bold print and the word \"no\" in faded, not bold, lettering.  Every other feature was, as listed, on the left hand side of the screen.  In other words, I wa sure I had purchased a 120 Hz TV that actually is a 60Hz TV.  After ordering the item, I re-checked all specs and was dismayed when I saw the word \"no\" in faded lettering next to the 120 Hz in the  features column.  When I tried, minutes later, to cancel the order, I found a) there was no way to cancel the order, the Amazon.com web site indicated the order could not be cancelled because the order was already in the process of shipping  After looking through the Amazon.com website for a way to cancel my order, the only thing I could do was to refuse to accept the TV when delivered.  That information was difficult to find, and b) I found there is no way to call and talk to someone at Amazon.com.In the end I decided to accept the TV when delivered after researching further on the difference between a 60 and 120 Hz TV.  I learned that my 37 inch version would not be greatly affected.
