That's the end of the good news.The customer service folks from LG are not all that helpful and you'll get transfered a few times before getting to the TV Warrany people.  I spent 55 minutes on the phone during my last experience, the majority of that time was spent listening to elevator music, waiting to get an appointment with one of their authorized repair goons.  My Amazing picture has been amazingly broken for 37 days now ... they've made two attempts to fix it and both failed (well, actually, one succeeded for about 4 hours), the remainder of that 37 days has been spent waiting on backorder parts and rescheduling appointments.Hopefully yours will not break down because LG, although they claim to be the greatest company since sliced peanut butter, do not blink at allowing a customer to sit with a broken product for over a month during the holidays.  I purchased two LCD TV's for Christmas and you can bet your sweet rear that they do not have an \"LG\" label on them.Did I already mention that it looked great while it worked (almost a whole year).", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Heavyweight with beautiful picture, sound", "Author": "T. A. Dominguez", "ReviewID": "R26HWGWHN8Y3PI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A young man in his early 20s enters an electronics store. He has a Best Buy compulsion and an overzealous father. He walks out with a new 50\" LG plasma television.I know what you're thinking, what does a 20-something need with a 50\" LG plasma? Probably nothing, be he replaces the broken Sony CRT from 1989 with a single mono-speaker and a 27\" tube. What an upgrade.Fast forward to many years later. He's now had the TV for almost 3 years, it's still beautiful. The picture quality on  blu-ray and over-the-air has all been tested thoroughly as while he has a 50\" LG plasma, his graduate school days didn't allow him enough money to pay for cable. The Onkyo reciever he's used, the DirecTV box, the Comcast box, the Sony, Samsung, or Panasonic blu-ray players he's hooked into it at one time or another all are shown as crisp as ever.Occasionally when watching a beautifully crafted 1080p film like Iron Man or The Fall he relishes the picture and color more than the actual storyline.Three years on, the LG still delivers.Why only 4 stars then? Because it weighs 130 lbs. Sure, it's beautiful but it comes with a price. Never again could he move the TV without a friend, never again could he change apartments without renting a truck and balancing the TV between two mattresses. It's the price he pays to forget how deep the pock marks on Morpheus' face are.Gross? Or Beautiful.
