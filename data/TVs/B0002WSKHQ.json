Seeve", "ReviewID": "R22UWNU5RYKK96", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this type of Sharp Aquos for about 7 months now, and I am still impressed, and still getting to know it's capabilities and range. I have it hooked up to my cable box, a DVD Player, and my Mac G4. As a TV it is great: a very good picture, and easy to move. The DVD's are excellent on it, although LCD does not show some types of pictures perfectly, including smoke, fast moving objects, and water, but it IS a great picture nonetheless. The main reason I bought it was for the PC Compatability, and My Mac G4 hooks up easily, and beats the hell out of even the largest Mac monitors which are all smaller (a lot) than this one.  I am still learning how to get a full 1080 i out of the unit, but other than that I really have no major complaints. The back of the TV and it's adjoining piece (about the size of a VCR) have too many large wires, and could have been made easier to understand, and with less clutter. The remote is large and bulky with a ridiculous extra compartment that should have just been made as part of the remotes face. The TV unit weighs about 50 lbs. and the extra unit weighs around 25 lbs.  All in all however, it is a fine device, worth the $3200.00 I paid for it through Amazon.com", "Date": "January 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not impressed", "Author": "Eric Hall \"Sher\"", "ReviewID": "R3600PO05MRB65", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For the amount of money that we spent on this television you would expect so much more. There are only a few HD channels available in our area.  We have digital cable and the tv comes in terrible. Our regular tv is much better. Every little pixel shows, it always looks distorted and the screen views are not impressive. We have had sharp and our cable company out to look at it, and unless you have HD on every single channel, digital cable will just not do. The picture is fuzzy and if you watch fast moving sports like we do, the tv will give you a major headache. Its going back. Don't bother waste the money for the name and the integrated tuner does not make one bit of difference.", "Date": "March 8, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0002WSKHQ"}}
