{"Reviews": [{"Title": "\" Incredible Picture, Stunning 3D \"", "Author": "J. Bronson", "ReviewID": "R3DPO0M52N1FRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:* Incredible Picture very near the quality of the high end Samsung's. Whites, Blacks,Colors are all exceptional.* Stunning, Amazing 3D - I can't even put into words how good this TV is at 3D, Other than its 100x better than I could of expected. Even when the source is 2D it does a decent job, of course this completely depends on the source. Now when the source is actually 3D, BluRay's or PS3 games, it's down right mind blowing how good and cool it is.* Beautiful Stand, if you don't hang it on the wall the stand doesn't disappoint.* Magic Remote, 1st impression was \"This is not going to cut it.\" Pleased to say my 1st impression was wrong. It is super easy to use and very quick at navigating.* Built in Apps - Netfix, Hulu this is becoming typical in most tv's,dvd/blu ray players,dvr's etc. Wont go into great detail, but its nice to have it directly in the TV and it works great , no complaints.Cons: App store - At the moment is pretty pathetic, nothing there worth downloading. Hopefully this is something that LG improves over the next few months. I must add, the extremely popular apps are already on the TV such as Netfix,Hulu,Amazon Video,Facebook,Twitter,Pandora,Youtube,MLB.TV,Vudu,MoG,Google Maps,Picasa.Overall I am going to rate this 4* but, really I'd rate it 4.5.Loosing .5 stars for the app store.Picture quality would be 4.75 stars.3D would be 5 stars. (Actually 6!)Extremely happy with my purchase would not trade it for any other TV in it's price range.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV - as long as you buy it with the right expectations", "Author": "Ramkumar Balaraman", "ReviewID": "R3DNYXPS2CV3O1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For my needs, this was an excellent buy. I imagine I would have been equally happy with the 55LM7600, but it was not in stock at my local MicroCenter where these are selling at insanely good prices. There are of course a few things to consider before you decide to buy this TV:Will the TV be situated in a basement, Or is most of your TV viewing done in dim lighting, Or do you care more about picture quality than brightness? If yes, get a plasma. If not, move on to the next question.Will you rarely be watching 3D content? If yes, get a Samsung 2D or even 3D TV. If not, move on to the next question.Do you live in a home with lots of storage space and outlets to keep 3D glasses charged (i.e. not a cramped NY apartment), and do you expect not to have more than 6-8 people watching 3D movies at the same time? If yes, get a Samsung 3D TV. If not, move on to the next question.If you came this far after the questions, as I did, this is the right TV for you. You might also be happy with the 55LM7600.What you should be prepared for:1. Ghosting and Flash-lighting. These defects are manifest in all edge-lit LED TVs. My previous TV is a Vizio XVT3D, which was a back-lit TV. It had no flashlighting, but still had noticeable ghosting, though not as bad as this LG unit. These defects are most noticeable when watching a dark movie (think dark knight), or a movie with cinema black bars on the top and bottom. For most content, when sitting a brightly lit room, the defects are not noticeable at all. The same issue affects top of the line Samsung TVs as well.2. Poor black levels. The black levels on this TV are nowhere near the black levels on my previous Vizio TV. If you calibrate the TV for deeper black levels, brightness suffers as well. LG displays are poorer than Samsung displays in this regard. A properly calibrated Samsung TV gets both better black levels and a brighter display than the corresponding calibrated LG TV.So why would you still buy this TV:1. Very good looking. TV looks great both on and off. It has such a thin bezel that the width and height are almost the same as the 47\" Vizio XVT3D that it replaced.2. In a brightly lit living room (which mine is), you will love the brightness and picture quality of this TV for most programming. Its only marginally worse than a Samsung TV having similar features. While videophiles would differ, I like the bright, vibrant colors on this TV much better than that of my backlit Vizio. Yes, blacks are not as deep and there is uneven flashlighting along the top edge, but the picture just feels so much better.3. Audio is much better than my previous TV, though this doesn't matter to me since I have an external Vizio bar and subwoofer that produce much better sound. But you could get by with just the inbuilt speakers. The only issue is that I now need separate remotes for the TV and sound control, so I ended up buying a Logitech harmony. I never liked the magic remote much anyway. It was very annoying whenever the mouse pointer turned up on screen when moving the remote by mistake, and what kind of remote doesn't have a dedicated input button?4. 3D is truly usable and excellent. A relative who swears by Samsung was blown away by the quality of 3D on this TV. The half-HD issue with passive 3D TVs is really a non-issue. Glasses are very lightweight and easy/cheap to replace. I don't have to worry about the kids breaking them. Nothing to recharge. Being an IPS display, 3D looks good even from wide angles. I recently watched Hugo in 3D, having previously seen it in 2D, and the experience is incomparable. The 3D in my previous TV was active-3D, and the heavy flickering glasses gave me a headache, and I never bothered recharging them after they ran out. I know the newer Samsung glasses are very lightweight and are rated at 70 hours per charge, but with a toddler around and never having enough outlets, its still a major entry barrier for me. I might consider active 3D again if they design TVs such that the glasses can be docked behind the TV.5. Excellent value. This unit set me back 12 benjamins at MC. A Samsung 3D TV with similar features was much more expensive at the time of this writing. Expense has never been the sole reason for me to choose a TV, but it definitely helps when the TV you choose based on features is also a great value.6. You can 'throw' youtube videos from your smartphone (Android/iPhone) to the TV. Probably useless for many, but very useful for me. All the other apps on the TV are redundant since I also have a Roku and PS3, but the youtube feature alone makes the 'smart' capability worthwhile.The only feature I really miss compared to my previous TV (Vizio XVT3D) is the ability to connect a bluetooth stereo headset. I got so used to this on the Vizio during those occasional late night gaming sessions using my PS3 while my toddler slept in the next room. I didn't realize this feature wasn't there until after I bought the TV. I just assumed since the remote was bluetooth a bluetooth headset would be supported as well. Sadly I was wrong. A little research also showed that the XVT3D was more of an outlier with such features and most modern TVs still don't have even half the features that it did 2 years ago. I do enjoy 3D gaming more now, so I guess you still really can't have everything.Overall, this was a great purchase for me. Definitely recommend, provided you have similar circumstances.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Twice malfunctioning, support non-existant.", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R2X46JJ7YNM4P9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this TV (55LM8600) after years of purchasing and trusting the LG brand, as replacement for an older 47-in non-3D LG LCD TV. While the delivery and appearance are top notch, this new TV either freezes or restarts every 10-15 minutes. When I first experienced the issue I contacted LG and they tried to troubleshoot over the phone, verified it was not a network/power/signal issue and a technician was dispatched for confirmation. The technician verified the issue, but noted that he \"thought\" it might be the main board, and that part was on back-order. The technician then recommended that I contact Amazon to replace. Amazon replaced it without issue. However, the replacement has the exact same fault. Upon contacting LG, I am told to once again contact Amazon as they believe I need another replacement. Upon contacting Amazon, I am told that a replacement would take a month or two as they are out of stock. I then contacted LG a final time and asked for a supervisor. I once again explained my issues and was told that a technician would need to be sent to diagnose the issue and order parts, parts that may be on backorder. LG would not offer a replacement, only a repair, but the repair might not work and it would take a few months to find that out (which would be outside of my Amazon return window). I am not sure what happened to customer service at these electronics manufacturers that after two malfunctioning TVs that it is apparently too much to ask to have them send out a technician with a replacement TV. I cannot be upset at Amazon, they helped where they could, and now unfortunately are out of stock of replacements. It appears that I will not to get to try a third time and will now think twice before buying LG products again.", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Top-notch pitcture, but lacking on the apps and UI.", "Author": "Brian R.", "ReviewID": "R34X5JFFT9XXRG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I'm very impressed with this TV set, from its looks to its picture quality.  This model sits just below LG's Flagship 9600 which upgrades to full LED backlighting vs. this set's edge-lit design.  This likely gives the 9600 the slight contrast ratio advantage, and the only other notable difference (specs-wise) is that this set is 240Hz vs. the 9600's 480Hz. For me, I doubt those enhancements would make much of a difference, and in fact, I've found myself able to comfortably able to enjoy LG's G2 model nearly as well.  If you must have top picture quality above all else, and this set is within your budget, I'd have no problems recommending it.  I value usability slightly higher, though, which is why I prefer the G2 as a family room tv because of its usability enhancements in place of picture quality.  Additionally, manufacturers are split as to whether they use Passive or Active 3D.  LG LCDs use passive, which I've found more than adequate for casual usage, and with a house of kids and their friends, passive is much more affordable in letting everyone enjoy the show.Specs don't tell the full story, though!  For me, while specs are important they can be far overshadowed by poor design and user interface.  Overall, the LG's user interface is very good.  In this review, I'll cover the remote, the main apps interface and the tv's general usage controls.--------Remote:--------The magic remote is a combination IR/Bluetooth remote with motion sensing features like a Wii's remote.  This allows you to shake the remote to wake it up, then point and click rather than navigate using up/down/left/right.  The scroll wheel also serves as the \"enter\" button.  I like using this remote and the point and click is much more intuitive than a traditional remote.  The dedicated 3D button is convenient, however, I'd give up the 3D button for an Input selection button in a heartbeat.The down-sides to this remote are that it's not universal, and since only the power on/off uses IR, you can't use this as a universal remote, nor can you get the functions you need from this remote in a universal.  Therefore, you'll always be using more than one.  Additionally, unlike LG's G2 google tv's, the remote doesn't have a keyboard, so you'll be clicking an on-screen keyboard instead.  With an emphasis on Smart Apps, this is a downer.-------------Smart TV Apps-------------The included apps are decent, however they don't offer an Amazon Instant Video app.  I haven't tried using the included web browser to get to Amazon's video service yet using this tv.  I've found LG's proprietary apps like the 3D showcase to be of little value.  With the 3D showcase in particular, the shows are a static selection, and frankly they're pretty boring.  It would have been nicer for LG to provide a channel with the latest 3D movie trailers or other promo content instead.The Android apps are paltry and not worth wasting time.  You won't find things like Angry Birds, but instead the spammy-style \"love-meter\" type apps.  Hopefully the selection will grow, but don't buy this tv thinking you'll find a bunch of useful independent apps.--UI--I like that you can customize the tabs that hold the apps, however, I wish you could also place specific functions on them - such as dedicated input selections like HDMI1/HDMI2, etc.Speaking of inputs, I honestly can't believe the limited selections for custom-naming your inputs.  You can only select from a pre-determined list.  Therefore, if you have both a Wii and Xbox, you will end up having two inputs listed as \"Game\".  Yep, that's your only choice for consoles, though they've felt it relevant to have HD-DVD as a selection.  This makes things more confusing than it should be, especially when every tv for the past 15 years has allowed me to actually input my own name for a device, yet this one doesn't.The built in picture adjustment wizard works fairly well, although the choices are somewhat ambiguous as to what they actually do.  The cover the basic adjustments, but leave the user in the dark regarding the refresh rate, local dimming, ambient light sensing, and some other things that will also affect picture.  For those looking to actually calibrate your set, it has the more advanced calibration controls built in and freely accessible.-------------General Usage-------------Picture quality is absolutely outstanding!  I turned off the ambient light sensing, as it darkened the image too much, and also when you bring up menus, it would try to darken the screen - even the picture adjustment windows did this, which is not the time when you want your tv automatically adjusting the picture.The 240Hz does take getting used to.  It seems almost too sharp and blur-free, so it feels unlike watching a typical television.  If you're a big sports watcher, this is great; however you may find the effect a bit un-natural and want to turn it down.--3D--3D is really nice with the passive glasses.  I've had the fortune of being able to directly compare the 47\" model of this tv with the 55\" G2.  My observations show that this set seems a bit more natural with the 3D effect, whereas the G2 seemed to have more depth out-of-the-box.  The tv's allow you to adjust this settings, as well, so you can fine tune it to your preferences.  Additionally, I can sit at a pretty decent side-angle and still see the 3D pretty well.  It seems more sensitive to top-bottom viewing vs. side viewing.I've seen some complaints on the glossy nature of the screen.  My guess is that it's due to the passive filter on the screen.  It's not a pure glass-like reflection, but isn't a matte finish, either.  It does have a decent amount of glare from side or rear lighting, but we really haven't had much issue with it.  The set it plenty bright to overcome most average lighting scenarios.  The passive filter on the tv causes bright lights to have some rainbow effects, but you'll really only notice this if the TV is off.---------------------Physical construction---------------------The looks of this set are insane.  The bezel is simply a 1-2mm piece of metal, which doesn't overlap the glass at all.  The picture comes within about \u00bd\" of the bezel, so pretty much all you see on 3 sides is the screen with a thin black border.  While the set is only about \u00bd\" thick at the top, it's a couple inches thick at the bottom to accommodate the speakers.  The stand is cool looking, though a bit wobbly.  The stand allows rotation from side to side, but no tilt ability.One other point I'm not too happy with is that there's only one shared input for component and composite inputs.  These both use a small cable dongle which takes the input and combines it into a 3.5mm jack that plugs into the tv.  Therefore, unless you use optical audio, you can only get sound for one of these.  Additionally, there's no s-video input at all.  Our Wii uses the composite inputs, and our Blu-ray was originally hooked up using component.  I could only get the sound to the tv for one of them, since the red/white wires only connect to the composite jack.  Luckily, I was able to just buy another HDMI cable for the blu-ray.  If you have more than one legacy input from these sources, you'll need to switch them through a receiver or input switch.-----------Conclusion:-----------I have both this set and the 55\" G2 Google tv.  I chose to put the larger G2 in our family room because it's more family and user friendly even though the 8600 has a nicer picture and looks.  If I were a big sports-watcher or someone who places picture quality above user interface, my choice would have been the opposite.LG has produced a very nice lineup of tvs, however they still need a bit of improvement with the user interface.  The lack of namable inputs and direct input selection makes these sets less convenient to use.  The default settings rack way to much toward energy savings creating a dynamically controlled picture that's often too dark.Use of the magic remote is good, but the magic remote causes the need for more than one remote to use your other components, yet a universal remote cannot replace the magic remote, either.Otherwise, the Smart tv apps are a bonus, even if the Android offerings and 3D samplers are pretty much useless.  Hopefully updates in the future will bring these to be more useful.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV, no warranty service", "Author": "photogo", "ReviewID": "R3VAV0EO0MIT8K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I briefly owned an LG 47LM8600 that, out of the box, had a dead Wi-Fi.  Web research showed that a number of folks had this same problem and a change of the main board was needed to fix the problem.  So ... poor engineering of the product.  I called the Canadian LG support line twice and both times (after having to go through their diagnostic procedure) was told that in-house service had been scheduled and that I'd receive a call to set up a time.  I never received a call.  I then entered an on-line complaint about the problem with the support line and the flippant e-mail response I received said to \"call their support line\".  The e-mail provide a link to give feedback on the support; which I did quite harshly; again no response from LG.

My co-worker was looking at it and the price was great on Amazon.  I had a Samsung LN52B750 which was only 3 years old, but I've wanted a 3D TV for a while now.  The reviews were very positive so I felt pretty confidant buying the TV.It was beautiful- slim, ridiculously small bezel and just a great size for my living room.The real treat however was after I turned on the TV.  What a picture.  I thought that the 2D picture wouldn't much surpass my LN52B750, WRONG!  The picture out of the box was noticeably better, after I used Picture Wizard to tune the picture the picture was leagues ahead of the LN52B750 - truth be told I had never adjusted the picture on my LN52B750 because there was no easy way to do it without some CD or DVD to tune the pic.My wife who doesn't normally pay any attention to things like picture quality even commented that the picture was much better(which was awesome because she was a bit P'od when i told her I had bought a new TV)The passive 3D is great.  I had seen demos of Sony's passive 3D and was pretty impressed, but this far exceeded my expectations.  HD 3D is phenomenal.  I was even more pleased with the 2D to 3D, while it doesn't jump out at you like true 3D content, the generated 3D effects make watching a \"Walking Dead Pretty awesome, watching the NCAA in 3D is pretty f'ng awesome also.I've only had teh TV for a week, I'll update this review as my impression deepens.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "good tv", "Author": "bonesky", "ReviewID": "R20PKSXJA6ODXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "has excellent picture--first one damaged in shipping replaced right a way--internet is good features easy to use--speakers not the best I use a stereo sys anyway", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous picture, but QA not the greatest (updated)", "Author": "J. Roman", "ReviewID": "R3N4MO01WB9ZXK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "***EDIT (06/04/2012)You may want to read the entire review, but I'm posting the update at the top so you can see the most important pro/cons right away.+++++++++++++++++++Pros:+++++++++++++++++++- Display is very bright, and colorful. Children programming looks outstanding.- Apps open quite quickly (guess that's what the Dual Core is for)- Very thin. Looks great when flush on the wall. This, however, will make the TV look smaller (depends on how far you sit from the TV, etc)- 3D works amazingly well on 3D content, better so than a 55ST30 with active shutter glasses, with less artifact and crosstalk. However, look at the 3D point in the Cons as well- Sound: Speakers sound well enough in situations where you don't need/want additional speakers. The speakers can fill up the room, if configured properly.- Settings: great menus for setting up the TV. Image quality increases greatly when properly calibrated, and 3D, speaker sound, etc all have their own long menus of settings.-------------------Cons:-------------------- QA, as commented on the title. At least I'm using this as LG's scapegoat. The TV I received had numerous problems. The light bleeding and clouding was unacceptable. It was all over the place. The easiest way to find this: turn on your TV (when it arrives) and move the mouse around the blank screen. If a vertical strobe of light follows your mouse, you've got a problem. Then, turn on any dark app on the TV, like Vudu or CinemaNow. Look for light bleeding around the corners and the sides. In my case, it was at all ends of the screen.- Magic Remote: I did not like this at all. It was a great gimmick that would probably work well if you were browsing the internet on the TV. For everything else, you'd be better off with a normal remote. The fact that the bluetooth would stop and the remote had to be re-paired with the TV every day was annoying, though at least it's easy to pair back up.- Glare: it's an LCD LED TV, but glare is worse than with a Plasma TV. OK, not worse, but about the same. I brought my 55ST30 upstairs to compare, and there was no difference. YMMV on this as my room is not your room.- Wireless issues: When the TV connects to Wifi, it tends to do it in under 10 seconds. That is, from the time you press the ON button, Wifi is ready in like 10 seconds. HOWEVER, some times the WiFi will not turn on at all. It'll just say \"connecting\" but won't do anything.- Netflix issues: In the 20 days I owned this TV, the Netflix app had several different issues: 1) At odd times it decided it'd not play any shows. It'd just say connecting and would not display the show, at all. Verified wifi/corded connection and everything else in the house was able to connect to the internet without a problem. 2) TV would lose App settings. Happened 4 times. We'd go to Netflix and our user name and password had disappeared, like if it was the first time we were booting up the TV.- 2D-3D conversion: doesn't really provide much. Was a big let-down. Maybe it's my fault for expecting similar depth to a 3D source. Sure you can make the show look like it's far away or closer to you, but the show itself doesn't change, and it causes strain on your eyes.- Channel Surfing: If you're used to switch from SD to HD signal on antenna shows by pushing up and down on the remote, I suggest you look elsewhere. For most people this is a non-issue since they all have either a cable box or a directv/dish box. However, the TV automatically generates channel listings. It groups the channels by type of signal: Antenna Analog, Antenna Digital, \"Cable\" Analog, \"Cable Digital. In order to change from Channel 2 to 2-1 you have to either scroll through like 50 channels, or click on a remote that shows on the top right corner, click on 2 > - > 1 > OK. A new, \"better\" remote should help you make things faster, not slower.- QA, yeah I mentioned it already, but it's that bad, at least with the set I got.- 3D errors: while watching any 3D sources, at times the TV would go blank for several seconds and would come back up stating \"3D signal detected\". It kind of destroys the experience. The worst part is that, even when the 3D is turned off (while watching a 3D movie), this would still happen, and the image would switch to 3D automatically.- Lipsync issues: Sometimes, you'll get lipsync problems, even when using the TV's speakers. This, to me, was ridiculous. Was watching YouTube videos on the TV, and when I switched to regular TV, the lipsync issue appeared. In order to fix it, I had to turn the TV off and back on. Makes me wonder if the other lipsync issues I was getting were the receiver's fault or the TV's. Now I'm thinking more of a TV issue.I'm sure I'm forgetting many things.In the less than 10 days between my first review and my update, the TV became such an annoyance that we didn't even want a replacement anymore. We simply refused the delivery when they came to pick up the original TV, and Amazon has been great at processing the refunds. Amazon CSRs get a 5/5 here.Updated Conclusion: I got a great price and jumped the gun. Reviews looked to be quite positive, and at first impression I liked the brightness on the set. The light bleed/clouding/lighting issues were noticeable immediately, even on the initial setup. There are 3D signal issues, the Magic Remote is more a pain than anything else, the image and audio (from the TV) are not always on sync, some apps lose settings randomly, the TV started shutting off and restarting the same day that the carrier came to pick it up.As much as I wanted to love this TV, the unit we got was so bad that, while I'm willing to give in and accept most issues could be isolated to just my unit, or a bad batch, I cannot give it more than 3 stars out of 5. Yes, PQ is crisp, clear, and bright. And there's no soap opera effect. And when it works, 3D looks great.Maybe I'm too picky or something.Please, feel free to read the rest of the review and to post a reply.I NO LONGER OWN THIS SET AS OF 06/02/2012. THEREFORE, I WILL BE UNABLE TO TEST/COMPARE THE UNIT.***ORIGINAL POST:Purchased this TV about 2 weeks ago, and I must say I have mixed feelings. I want to love it, I really do, but I believe my unit is defective.Picture Quality:Outstanding. My wife and I stared at it for a while, couldn't believe the picture quality was so much better than that of our previous TV. I researched the image configuration for a similar TV model (I think it was the 55LM9600, which is still on pre-order), and the picture looks more real, instead of so \"vivid\", or cartoony. Both 2D and 3D look impressive, with 3D making believers out of nay-sayers. Now, don't get me wrong, choose your movies. Don't try to show off the TV to a friend watching a 2D-3D conversion, because it really doesn't add much, and don't use a 3D Blu-Ray like Green Hornet (wow what a waste). You're better off purchasing the 2D version and applying 2D-3D conversion in the 2-3 action events throughout the movie. In fact, my son was so disatisfied, he asked me to put it on 2D if possible.However, get Avatar 3D, or Underworld: Awakening, and it'll feel much different. What a trip. My wife didn't like Avatar that much. Granted, it's slow, but full of special effects. She admited, after watching the entire length of the movie on 3D, that she likes it much, much more. The special effects, and the completely 3D movie makes it much more entertaining. A \"wow! look at that brain\" when they're checking for brain activigy in the connection to the avatar, which is like watching a movie on 3d, where they're watching something on 3D, and you see it on 3D! I don't know, it made the TV a worthy purchase.Sound:Not tested. I do have the TV hooked up back to the receiver through SP/DIF Optical cable, and the sound is just fine. On the TV itself, you don't see any speakers, feels more like a monitor than a TV in that aspect, but the sound from the speakers was good enough for going a couple days without the sound system and not complain. We put it at level 9-12 and you can hear it all clearly.When passing a 3D blu-ray from the PS3 to the TV through the Receiver, I end up having to put the lipsync all the way up, or video and audio end up way out of sync. I've never used the lipsync functionality and I was quite shocked that I'll have to use it every time I watch a movie. It happens on 2D too. However, I don't know if this is the TV, the PS3, or the receiver's fault.Internet/Apps:Very, VERY lacking. I guess, maybe, it's my fault. I've come used to my tablet/xbox, so having HBO Go, MAX Go, Netflix, Hulu, Hulu Plus, Crackle, Pandora, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and Spotify seemed like very basic requests. I Can play Amazon video on PS3, (have Prime), so the TV didn't add much. It does come with some 3D content, and that's always welcoming. So missing some of these on TV, makes me feel like the industry is working too hard to put the same technology in every piece of equipment. Why do I need the same apps on a network connected TV, a network connected receiver, a network connected blu-ray player, an xbox360 with LiveGold, a ps3 connected online, and a roku 2 XD? Each one adds its own benefit, but I'd rather see one single box that has all the apps that I use, and plug that in, so that I don't have to rely on other equipment. \"Do you want to watch Netflix on the TV, xbox, or ps3?\" Wait, what? In the end, we do tend to watch it on the TV.I have not tried browsing the internet, but my son did crack up at some youtube on the TV, and it looked ok. The WIFI is fast, and quick getting connected. I haven't had any problems. It detects my wife's computer when she turns it on, and I'd like to research on how to share some content with the TV, and its capabilities. I'm not that great at reading instructions lol.2D-3D ConversionOne of the reasons I wanted an LG 3D TV was that I had heard they were the best at 2D-3D conversion. So, of course, I tried it out. Yeah, I don't know. Can you really tell a difference? Now, you can make any movie \"3D\" in that you can push it further away from the front of the tv, kind of like looking at the far end of a box, or you can pull it closer toward you, where it feels like it's out of the TV. However, we watched Cars 2 on 2D>3D, and a couple other shows and there was nothing at all on 3D. I tried playing Borderlands on 2D>3D, and it hurt my eyes. Everything was on 2D, in reality, but some things did pop out (like some menu options, banners, Ads, etc along the road. Using the sniper also gave a 3D effect, but it was shortlived. It was more a gimmick, and a bad one at best, than anything else. I'm not expecting Dora on 3D, but I was hoping that at least some games would look \"cooler\". My son was playing COD:MW3, and I told him to switch to 3D. All I noticed is that, in order to generate the 3D imagery, the TV was cutting some vertical lines from left and right, and making the image a few pixels smaller. But then there was no real 3D. My said \"oh, it's in 3D!\", but not 10 minutes later he had already stopped wearing the glasses and the TV was back to 2D. It wasn't adding enough depth to the game to be worthwhile. This is just personal experience, and I'll surely try again with different content. In the meanwhile, I'm thinking of purchasing the Nvidia 3DPlay software to see if 3D gaming through the PC is viable. I'm not putting my hopes up, though with the machine doing all the recalculations instead of the TV, and the TV simply displaying the video, it should be much better than LG's own contraption. If this 2D>3D conversion is much better than in previous models, I can't imagine how it was before.GlassesThe TV comes with 6 glasses, and the added-for-free LG 6-pack was useful so that my daughter could wear some glasses. I like the male adult glasses on the set. However, My wife hates the female adult glasses from that set. She and my son reverted to the original ones that came with the TV. All in all, it's still 12 sets of glasses, and caters to multiple uses (does wearing prescription glasses, toddlers, adults, etc). Imagine purchasing 12 sets of glasses for an active shutter TV...In the best of cases, that'd be $240 with the new samsungs that each set costs $20, but Panasonic originals cost from $70 to $200 each. Add to that the fact that 3d cinema glasses work just fine, too, and that you can find \"cool-looking\" polarized passive 3d glasses in many differents shapes from different brands, and they all work.Magic Remote:The remote, while great, doesn't let you specify which channel you want to jump to when using the digital antenna embedded on the TV, so you end up having to use the wheel more than necessary. You also can't use the wheel all that often, and if you touch it while you're watching anything but TV, it'll prompt you a message asking you to switch to TV channels instead. With the remote, there are many usual functions that'll take you longer to find. For example, if you want to go to settings, you have to click Home, then go to settings, then go to video, and change the settings there, as opposed to having a button for settings or even display settings on the remote itself. The 3D button at least is useful, but more often than not the remote stays next to the TV where the kids can't reach it and where we don't use it. I mean, after thinking about it, there's not much you wouldn't be able to do with the remote that you wouldn't do with a normal remote with left-right, up-down arrows. When you're in menus, the scrollwheel doesn't scroll through the options. Well, then what's the point? Instead, you have to use the up-down-left-right that surrounds the wheel. Well, that's great, genious! In fact, if you don't want to use up-down-left-right, you have to click with the cursor on the up-down screen buttons for it to do anything. So I find it a useless novelty. Granted, it may be great for web browsing but...I don't use the TV for that. Netflix looks great, though by default all 3:2 is being zoomed and stretched in an oddly manner.This remote would be great as a companion, that is, as an extra remote, if a normal one were included! It's fine fur turning the TV and 3D on and off and...that's about it. For most other things, you're going to use your receiver's remote for the audio and input switching, and then the BD's remote for watching a movie, or the cable remote for watching cable, etc.I should note that, for apps, the mouse does scroll through the different app icons fine, but really, is that why we need a \"dual core\" processor on the TV? Oh wait, I heard that was required for the voice recognition! I'll admit, I haven't used that part yet, so I can't \"review\" that part, though I can definitely research it. My point, though, I'm better off using kinect, if I want to tell my system what to do.I'm wondering if a normal remote for 55LW6700 (correct me if I'm wrong) or similar model (with a NORMAL remote PLUS a 'Magic' Remote) would work on this TV, then the TV would become a little faster on some basic functionality (channel switching, for example).The TV separates the channels on \"Analog TV, Digital TV, Analog Cable, Digital Cable\", so if you're trying to watch TBS on 109-1, and Channel 2 HD news (2-1 over here), be prepared to run that wheel. If you use a cable box, you won't be worrying about this. But then again, YOU WON'T BE USING THE REMOTE ANYWAYS.Build:The TV is VERY slim, and very light! It looks amazing. When we first received it we were WOW!d it does look impressive. Moving from a 47\" Vizio SV472XVT to a 55\" \"frameless\" felt like the tv was only as wide as the previous TV, except it was all image and no frame. I put the TV on the stand for a couple days before installing the wall mount, and the wall mount is quite sturdy, though the TV feels a little wobly. When I researched the TV, I was worried that it didn't have an antenna input! it didn't show in any pictures, and nobody mentioned it. Same with other regular inputs/outputs. It actually has standard digital antenna in, SP/DIF optical out, VGA (not DVI) in, RCA, and Composite (if I can remember correctly). All these are located on the bottom left corner of the TV (when you're looking at the TV screen), going upwards, so that you can nail the TV to the wall flush, and still be able to connect everything properly. You get 4 HDMI on the left lower side, going to the left. We got some runner to hide the cables and make it look nicer without all the cables hanging around.GLARE! All my previous LCDs have had matte screens, and the only glare I've ever noticed was on my glossy TC-P50V10, due to it being plasma, which I already knew before I purchased it. Well, some reviews said it was matte, so I didn't even worry about it. On its stand, there was not much glare; but once it was hung on the wall mount, we started noticing that it was reflecting the light through the curtains, and the light fixtures. We got darker drapes to go over the curtains, and tilted the TV down. Now we can watch the TV without glare AFTER 8:30 PM. The drapes were obviously not covering the light enough, so this would be best in a room where all the light is coming from behind the tv, or the sides. Glad I got a tilting wall mount, or I'd have sent it back a week ago.The TV looks like a window, and with the glare, we can see the window that is behind us, so...heh, little joke, but not really.Cons/Issues/Bugs:1) When I watch 3D Blu-Rays (through PS3 connected to 3D receiver connected to TV), in several occassions the image would go pitch black for 3-5 seconds and come back with \"3D signal received\" or some such. I don't get the \"no signal received\" or the restart logo, just a blank, pitch black, screen. This happened watching Avatar 3D and Green Hornet 3D.Additionally, we switched Green Hornet from 3D to 2D (there's not much 3D there anyway), but at certain moments the image would go off again, and come back with \"3D signal received\" again, and it'd switch automatically to 3D.I have a Vizio 3D BD player, so I may test this again to see if the PS3 is causing the problem. Will try bypassing the receiver and connecting the BD-player directly to the TV as well, and will compare results.2) TV does not recognize input from receiver after having been turned off. 3 times has my wife already called me that when she goes in the morning to turn on the TV, our daughter cannot watch Dora, and that all she sees is a blank screen with \"No Signal\" on it. The screen shows that there's signal on HDMI 1 (as in it lets you select it), but once you switch to it, it shows \"no signal\". I've found that, in order for the TV to detect the signal, I have to switch between SD and HD channes on the Cable box, and then the receiver sends the signal switching to the TV, and then the TV starts showing the cable programming.3) Does this happen to anybody? is this the clouding/backlight bleeding many talk about? On a blank screen, such as before a movie starts, or after it ends, use the remote. Wherever the remote is, I see a band of white light that goes from top to bottom, following the pointer. I figured it was done so that you could find the mouse or some such. HOWEVER, Plug in the PS3, start a movie, and before the BD starts reading, when it's black and you see only white letters, there'll be a white band of light following the letters, again, from top to bottom. Annoying, but figured, OK, it's just for menu options, again, some kind of \"tool\" to see the text but...this has never happened on any of my TVs, and my TC-P55ST30 doesn't show this lighting either. I think the worst was when the credits are going up. You can see the lighting behind the credits very, VERY noticeably, and it's irritating. It doesn't cause much issues when the screen is full of movement and color, but I'm going to try using a command prompt on the computer to see how bad this is. I imagine that dark scenes on a movie will suffer from this as well.4) The TV channel separation makes for a lot of scrolling (the not having direct input through buttons on the remote doesn't help either).5) The 2D>3D conversion. I was expecting much more. Most of the times it doesn't provide the amount of depth you were hoping for, even with the ability to manually tweek the depth modes, settings, and levels.6) It has no PIP, no POP, nor Bluetooth audio, all of which my old SV472XVT has. When you're upgrading, you're hoping to upgrade in all the departments, not giving up functionality for a bigger, better looking image. Then again, those functionalities are missing from most TVs, still, nowadays, which is a bit ridiculous..Final Verdict:You won't find a TV with better picture quality (obviously, this is debatable, as this is my first 3DTV). This TV is definitely impressive. The PQ just feels second to none, and the 240Hz felt like the video was quick, smooth, but not \"soap-opera-like\" at all. The 3D when watching original 3D content is outstanding, specially taking into consideration that it's a passive 3D TV (with all the too-talked-about half-resolution 3D discussions - it still looks like full HD, whether it really is or isn't) with bright colors and deep, real-like, blacks. Viewing angles and incredibly great.Thigs to watch out for:- The Magic Remote is quite pointless on most normal situations. It would have worked better as a barebones secondary remote than as the main remote.- The apps that come installed work, but the app market has nothing to add to the TV, yet.- The clouding/backlight bleeding is present in many of the units sent by LG. I don't know if they believe that the normal unaware customer won't care, and therefore passes QA, but the effects are quite noticeable with just putting some little attention onto it.I'd love to be able to enjoy this TV, but there are certain things that I believe are wrong with the unit that I received, and I'll be contacting Amazon for either an exchange or a refund. I'd rather get an exchange, because the picture quality is great, and it was, in my eyes, a great purchase, but if the replacement (IF they can even replace it) has the same issues, I'd rather get my money back. Maybe I just jumped the gun too quickly on the 3D ecosystem.Feel free to comment on my review. It's my first time writing a review, so it's long, boring, and probably doesn't provide you with much help. The TV is truly amazing, and the few caveats I have may be due to having gotten a defective unit, or my high hopes on a technology that hasn't developed \"too much\" yet.Improve the 2D>3D conversion, add more apps, fix the QA issues, and we have a #1.By the way, with the TV being so light, we did our first wall mount install, and now the TV is just a couple inches off the wall (can bring closer if we want to), therefore the TV actually doesn't look any bigger than the 47\", because the 47\" we had before was over 2 feet closer to us, so 65\" would have been best, but at the price, and without as many options, it wasn't a viable option. I'd shoot for a 55LM6700 if you don't need 240Hz. Dual-Core is only for the apps and the voice commands, and the difference between 6700 and 7600 is 120Hz > 240Hz, I believe.4 STARS because most of the issues I've found may be caused by other components in my setup. The one star was removed due to LG QA concerns, the barely useful remote (that cannot control any other piece of equipment), the TV Channel configuration, the lack of apps, and the \"I haven't found it useful yet\" 2D>3D conversion. Regardless, the picture quality is outstanding and I'd not give it a lower rating.I have recently purchased a TC-P55ST30 so I'll be comparing the light bleeding, clouding, and picture quality.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "3 lemons", "Author": "racknac \"racknac\"", "ReviewID": "R22D28VUZMU02U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This has been a 2-month journey which has led me conclude that LG is all looks and crappy quality.

The price was great for such high end tv with all the bells and whistles. I thought I was getting one on the best TV's.. But after a short while dealing with the constant ghosting, blurring, and light bleeding I gave up. It felt like it was a job playing with the seetings everyday hoping to get it right and fix all the issues and make the TV look good finally, but it didnt... I gave it 3 weeks, but couldn't convince myself that it was me and not the TV. Sometimes the picture blew my mind it was so good, but 75% of the time it looked worse than my 8 year old Akai 720p plasma..Its difficult in making your decision, you and I rely on the reviews. I've been looking at TV's and reviews for months now. believe me there are all good and bad ones on every TV. So in my experience on this TV, it was not that good. I can see where the Tv can shine, but it failed most of the time. Especially coming from an 8yr old plasma, I thought i would be blown away by the picture, but I never really was. family members thought the same thing, and were not impressed.The LG LM8600 is strikingly beautiful though, it looks gorgeous on and off.(the actual TV set). Its crazy thin, sleek, almost no bezel. Wish I could say the same for the picture. I guess you just have to pull the trigger and take a chance, maybe you'll get a good one!  isn't it sad that we have to sit here and hope we get a TV that works properly for nearly 2k.I must say that this has kind of shy'd me away from the Edge Lit LED displays... I hear about light bleeding, and other issue it seems on almost all of them, unless its $4000. So I'm currently debating on a Panasonic GT50 Plasma. It has really good reviews, and I have a plasma and its been good to me! But its Highly outdated and on its last leg!Side note- Amazon customer service is great. Return was a breeze. But the Delivery company is horrible. Delivery day they told me between 10am and 5PM, which is crazy, so I was stuck waiting around all day.  The guy didn't show up until 730PM. Then when he finally showed, I look out the door and I see him dragging in the huge TV box by himself, Literally bouncing it off his knees to gain momentum. I was pissed!  I wonder if these tv's have so many issues because they are abused by delivery staff. On top of that, no help taking it out or setting it up. He didn't even inspect it. The return pick up was just as bad, one guy, no help. He sat there and watched me struggle trying to get the TV in the box by myself and put it together properly. I really did not like this service, wish Amazon would look more into this, because Amazon as a company is excellent!Overall, I would say Pass on this TV based on my experience. If it was $899 id say jump on it, but for $1599 or more, it isnt worth it!  Ghosting, Light Bleeding, Blurriness, Non-HD looking picture, it always says 60hz and couldn't figure out where the 240hz comes into play. the magic remote can be annoying for some, I got used to it. those are just some of the issues I encountered.

When watching a movie last weekend I began noticing significant clouding. It was most noticable during the credits but I saw issues with the picture throughout the movie.

That was the last straw for us, I'm returning it and getting a Samsung PN60E550 60-Inch 1080p 600Hz 3D Slim Plasma HDTV (Black) instead.Original post:I recently purchased this LG 55LM8600 and thought I'd share my initial thoughts.ProsBright picture with vivid colorsImpressive passive 3DVery responsive apps and a decent app libraryMediaLink in combination with a Plex server is awesomeWifi screen share seems really useful but I don't have a device that works with it yet.DNLA works really well, I used it to watch videos I had recorded on my phoneMagic remote allows you to navigate very quicklyConsAll the cons are with the magic remote:The magic remote is too sensitive. If I leave it on the arm rest of my lazy boy and start rocking then the pointer appears on my screen. They really need to add a quick way to enable and disable the motion sensitivity. They may be able to correct this with a software update but I don't know if they have plans too.There is no play/pause button on the magic remote so when watching video on MediaLink, DNLA, or Netflix you have to move the pointer to the play/pause button on screen. That feels like a lot of work when I just want to pause a video quickly. Seems like a play/pause button should be on a remote for a smart tv. Again, this they could maybe fix in a software update by repurposing the OK button when your watching video.The last issue is that the magic remote operates over Bluetooth. While this works fine, it also means you can't use the remote to program a universal remote such as my dish network remote. I was able to find a remote code to get the dish remote to control power, volume, inputs, settings, and some navigation. However, the dish remote can learn from another remote to add missing functionality and this doesn't work because the remote uses a bluetooth signal and not infrared. This means I can't turn on 3D or access the Home/Apps menu using my dish remote.SummaryThe technology in this TV is really great and the main flaw I find with it is the magic remote.

It reboots every 2 minutes on all settings/inputs.  I've owned the set a little over three weeks.  Because my window of return is so small at this point, I will NOT call LG and have a tech come out.  After extensive research tonight, it seems there is no fix.  I've ordered a return through Amazon due to my time running out to do so.  Disappointed.  I loved the TV.  I cannot recommend it anymore.  This problem seems very very common.I held off writing a review until I had the TV for 3 weeks.....I wanted to really learn how to use and adjust the unit before coming up with a knee-jerk review.Pros: Very nice design and picture.  The magic remote took some getting used to, but that's why I waited to write my review.  I'm used to it and it's fantastic.  The blacks are deep and the \"smooth motion\" makes blu ray images and HD broadcasting look like it's right in your room with you.  If you don't like it, simply turn it off.....the picture remains crystal clear but you don't get the freaky OMG clarity that comes with it.  Very very easy to hook up to my wireless network and start cruising around in within minutes out of the box.  3D is fun and the glasses are comfortable.  The 2D to 3D is commendable actually.....I had my doubts, but it is less gimmicky than kind of cool.  Works GREAT on Netflix streaming kids shows like Fanboy and Chum Chum......Cons: reflective screen.  I'm coming from a plasma, so it's not a HUGE issue for me, but I can see it as an issue for some coming from LCD.  Blooming effect.  I see many complaints about this on these reviews and, again, I held off reviewing until I really learned how to adjust my set.  If your \"local dimming\" is set on high, you're gonna get a lot of blooming (look up the term) around your mouse icon and whites against blacks on a mostly black screen....it's NON EXISTENT during regular programming.  If you can't stand it, simply turn off \"local dimming\" in your TV menu screen.

Well, after a month it's still there. The flashlight and the light bleed are on all 4 corners. It's more noticeable when you are watching a movie that has black bars on the top or bottom. For example if you are watching a movie where in the scene the right top corner is dark and the bottom has a light, the entire right column will light up and become distracting. Even the black bar lights up. In some other scenes, the light bleed completely washes out colors on the corners.The new problem I started to have recently is with streaming video from my media server. When I stream movies from my media server, the sound and the picture are not synced. The video lags behind the sound, which makes the movie unwatchable. There is no setting to adjust it during streaming while there is a setting during normal usage.The last issue I have is with TV speakers. At any level higher than 10, the speakers sound bad and I can hear static from the vibration of the speakers.I am out of my return period now and stock with a bad TV. I have to call LG again so that they can send a technician to see if they can fix any of the issues. I am guessing the flashlight and light bleed is due to the design since both of the TVs had it.

I bought this on sale from Tigerdirect and saved hundreds of dollars.  My previous TV was just a normal 47\" LCD with a low 60hz refresh rate.  I was tired of seeing all the ghosting of dark images and there were color fluctuations...so I bit the bullet on this set.  Simply put, the set is amazing!  My friend has a Samsung 55\" LED and this is a better image all around.  The image quality is pristine and color reproduction is fabulous.  Blur is nonexistent.  Blacks are sharp and deep.  Also, the 120hz-240hz refresh feature on most LCD/LED sets creates a \"soap opera\" image effect but this doesn't happen with the LG model.  Thank goodness because that looks ridiculous.  My friend's Samsung LED TV looks like that and drives me crazy.  Even over-the-air HD programming looks great.I have it hooked up to my PS3 and a Panasonic DMP-BDT220 Integrated Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player and the images are phenomenal.  The 3D feature is incredibly realistic and makes the movies look even better.  We were watching A Christmas Carol the other night and I was blown away and how flawless the image was.  It is also nice wearing the passive glasses as they are lighter and don't need to be recharged...and if you need new glasses they are so cheap.The smart apps are great, but we only use Netflix.  I wish it included Amazon Prime streaming, but that works on our PS3 and bluray player.  The image quality is just as beautiful using Netflix.  We also use the network streaming features and it connects without any issues and streams perfectly.  We have watched hours of TV over our home network.Some downside that I experienced is that the TV broke after about 1 month of use.  The left half of the screen began to flicker and was dimmed, which shouldn't be happening with such an expensive TV.  Fortunately, LG was quick to send out repair people and the TV was repaired to perfection again.  Also, the screen is incredibly glossy and this can cause viewing problems during daylight hours because of glare issues, however, it doesn't really bother me anymore.  The remote isn't perfect and can be annoying when dealing with it going inactive or being unresponsive, but it was easy to learn how to use it.  The last complaint I have is that the audio was out of sync with this TV.  I didn't have an issue with my last TV, but I was able to fix the problem through a setting on my receiver, but it was incredibly frustrating until I found the fix.Overall, I absolutely love this TV.  It has better image quality than any of the Samsung models I have looked and the 3D feature is a giant bonus that really brings movies and games to life.

R.", "ReviewID": "R3NQIA99ZK5WYS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It should be noted that I have neither owned an LED HDTV or a 3D HDTV before, thus this review will be from the perspective of a novice user and free of the technical jargon found in other \"expert\" reviews.  With that out of the way, my initial impression upon unboxing the unit was that it was sleek in design and extremely thin (roughly an inch in depth!).  The screen has a glossy finish associated with plasma TVs instead of the matte finish found on most LCD TVs.  I actually prefer the matte finish as it eliminates much of glare from rooms with various light sources.  As it is, to truly appreciate the rich picture quality of this TV, it should be situated in a room that is as close to a dark environment as possible.  A minor quibble, but still worth noting considering the high-end nature of this unit.  Mounting the TV to the stand with the included screws was a breeze and the initial onscreen setup after powering up the unit for the first time was also smooth.  In my first week of usage, I began to notice a bizarre \"ghosting\" or picture lagging effect during panning shots and fast motion (especially dimly lit sequences) when viewing blu-rays, as well as satellite transmissions (each on separate inputs).  I knew that this was highly unusual given the 240hz refresh rate so I immediately contacted LG customer service and after some troubleshooting tips via the phone, I was put in contact with a local LG technician who came to my house within 2 weeks.  He suspected a faulty mainboard (an issue with some previous LG LED models) and quickly replaced it with a brand new one.  Unfortunately, the problem persisted, and I was informed that the issue was not with the unit but instead with the equipment that I had hooked up to it, which simply was not technically adequate given the advanced specs of the TV.  He recommended upgrading from the Mediabridge Ultra Series High Speed HDMI Cable that I was using to a more high speed one.  Given the costly retail prices of such high-end TVs, I do not know why companies refuse to supply HDMI cables, are at the very least, offer up suggestions for HDMI cables that are best suited for a particular unit.  The technician also recommended that I upgrade my Panasonic DMP-BD75 Blu-ray Disc Player to a 3D player that could output at a higher refresh rate, as well.  ***Please see the end of this review for an update to this problem***As far as the rest of the TV's features, the remote control is perhaps the most glaring difference.  It is best described as a cross between a Wii game console controller and a computer mouse.  It is motion sensitive with very little actual buttons to push.  Much of the functions are performed by an onscreen cursor which one uses to navigate through the various menus, much to the chagrin of this reviewer's old-fashioned tastes.  While I eventually adjusted to the radical differences with this \"magic remote,\" I found the incredible motion sensitivity of the remote to be rather frustrating.  The slightest jostling of the remote results in a cursor appearing on the screen, where it will remain until the remote is kept absolutely motionless for 5 seconds.  This means that if one has the remote on the bed or the couch, the slightest movement will cause the cursor to appear right in the middle of the screen.  Why LG did not think of a way to disable this feature or at least not make it so sensitive to motion is a mystery.  As far as the actual 3D aspects, let me begin by stating that the 3D glasses are virtually identical to the 3D glasses used in movie theaters.  Made of lightweight plastic and slightly dark lenses that almost give the impression of wearing sunglasses, it is easy to forget that one is even wearing them.  The upconversion from 2D to 3D is done though the push of a button on the remote, at which time an onscreen menu appears with a several selectable choices in 3D effects, depending on the source material (blu-ray, satellite, video games, etc.).  The 3D effect is best when viewing movies with bold colors and brightly lit scenes.  My viewing of The Dark Knight blu-ray added little to the viewing experience given the drab colors and dark visuals of the film.  In contrast, though, the Back to the Future blu-ray simply looked amazing.  The lightning effects of the Delorean as it reached 88mph were remarkable and the shots of Hill Valley in the daylight had a feeling of depth that has to be seen to be fully appreciated.  While the 3D upconverion is not up to par with most 3D movies found in theaters or a 3D blu-ray disc played on actual 3D blu-ray player, it is still a nice treat to be able to view new and classic movies in a different light.As impressive as the 3D feature is, I must confess that I have used it less and less over time.  The reason is a combination of not wanting to wear glasses all the time but also the stunning clarity of the 2D image!  I did not think it would be so noticeable but it is worlds above my 3-year old 1080p Sharp LCD HDTV.  The black levels are indeed black and not the dark grey seen with LCD TVs and the colors are rich, vibrant, and as true to life as I have ever seen it.  This unit also upconverts the picture quality of DVDs quite nicely by eliminating much of the video noise and heavy pixelation that are noticeable when viewing DVDs on a 1080p HDTV.  My blu-rays movies have also never looked better, to the point where I am noticing things for the very first time.  While watching the aforementioned Back to the Future blu-ray, I was amazed at how I could clearly see the subtle color variations between Doc Brown's old-age make-up and his actual skin tone.  LG definitely delivers on its promise of seeing \"details and colors like never before.\"  It goes without stating that the various picture and sound controls should be adjusted to match one's personal tastes as the original factory settings are far from optimal.  I chose to minimize the TruMotion feature as leaving it on at the original setting caused the picture to look \"sped up\", almost to the point where the movement of people seemed to look like it was shot with a camcorder.  The sound is also great, but I would not state that it was as much improved from my previous LCD TV as the picture quality.  It is also worth mentioning that the actual physical manual that accompanies this unit only contains basic installation instructions and tips.  The explanations of the various picture and audio settings must be accessed through an onscreen user guide.  While this was a nice way to save on paper, it is also frustrating as one has to scroll through various screens to find out details on particular features and then exit out of the menu screens and then go into the picture/sound settings to make any adjustments.  Quite frustrating for those who may not have the best memory or would simply prefer a traditional paper manual that one could read while simultaneously making any changes.  There are also various apps that are installed on this unit, but I only accessed a few of them.  Accessing and navigating through the apps were quite easy and free from any technical glitches so far.Overall, LG has lived up to almost all of its selling points with this unit.  The TV is sleek and stylish, the 3D is quite impressive, and the truly amazing clarity of the 2D picture is perhaps the most surprising aspect for this reviewer.  The only real cons were the magic remote (which some will take to more easily than others), the glare-prone glossy screen, the onscreen manual (again, user preferences vary), and the \"ghosting\" effect during fast motion which hopefully will be resolved once I upgrade to better hardware.****UPDATE 6/16/12***I have since updated to a LG BP620 3D Blu-Ray Player Built-In Wi-Fi along with Monster Ultimate High Speed HDMI 1000 HDX cables and, much to my dismay, the \"ghosting\" effect during fast motion persisted.  I once again called LG and another technician was sent to inspect my TV.  This technician determined that the problem was most likely a hardware issue with this model and not a result of my particular configuration.  When he telephoned his supervisor about a possible solution, he was instructed to tell me to \"sit 11 feet from the unit as stated in the manual\" and that would somehow magically resolve the problem!  In other words, LG had no hardware or firmware fix for this particular issue and was simply looking to offer me a token resolution.  The technician stated that he wished he could offer up \"a real fix\" but LG had to take the initiative to investigate the issue, and that would only happen if they received enough complaints, which could take an indefinite amount of time.  He also cautioned that the next version of this particular model (the LG Cinema Screen 55LM9600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 480 Hz Dual Core Nano LED HDTV) would most likely have even worse fast motion \"ghosting\" since it has twice the refresh rate, and the problem was not resolved with my particular model before putting its successor on the market.  So, despite the vastly impressive specs, I simply cannot recommend this unit given the quality control issues that should have been addressed long before this model (or its successor) was ever put on the market.  If LG ever offers an actual solution via a firmware update or hardware fix, I shall update this review once more.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gotta Love Amazon! (Good TV, Somewhat Overpriced.)", "Author": "JoJo", "ReviewID": "R2SMW4JTDS823Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, two thumbs up for Amazon! They have the best return policies around, on top of having the best service to their customers. So, Kuddos Amazon! :)I had this TV for exactly 30 days, played around with it and enjoyed several movies, shows, and games on it, but I began to notice some heavy ghosting and clouding on some darker seens in movies. It mainly happened when watching TV late at night, under almost complete darkness. It was so bad that it distracted me from the film. I got online to research this and I guess the word out there is that these models tend to have issues with that.While Online, I found out the price had gone down significantly, from what I had payed for it, $500 lower to be exact. I asked if they would honor the price warranty I would keep the TV, and ignore the clouding, Etc. I rarely watch tv under these circumstances anyway, so for me, I was decided that I could live with it. They responded that the price warranty was only for 14 days and they wouldnt give in to extending this on a per case basis. I felt it was a fair enough request on my part. It was, after all, $500! Anyhow, they were stuck on their decision so I went ahead and used my return period to return it. UPS picked it up and took back to Amazon. Sorry, Amazon :( Maybe you should give your supervisors room to make decisions on a per case Basis. I would not have returned it if they would have honered the price warranty. So now I am left with the chore of researching a NEW option for a TV purchase or reorder the same one for $500 Less! I might just go with something else as I feel that this specific model is a bit overpriced. The Only mayor difference from the cheaper model is the Dual Core Processor. I actually own both models and have never seen any difference in performance amongst the two (LM8600 & LM7600).", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic 3D Television!!", "Author": "G. Cox \"Shanghaied\"", "ReviewID": "RXGDLNE6HNTE6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first 3D television.  I bought a 3D DVD player and 3D movie just to test it. Everything arrived the same day. And while I was very impressed with the 3D, it's the other things that fascinated me even more than the 3D.  This television really is a computer on the inside.It was so easy to set up the wireless network. It automatically linked up with my two computers via the network. And it is wireless N at that. I am watching home videos from my laptop computer via my wireless network.  So I can look at any shared photo or video. It has photo slide show and the picture quality is just amazing - all wireless from my computer. And the picture quality is very good.  I am so impressed with this television set.  I am still discovering things. It will take a long time to even learn all the things it can do. It has Netflix, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Vudu, Hulu, Cinema Now, and MLTV.  And they have joined the app movement where you can download applications - some for free and obviously some for a fee.The remote control is mostly an air-mouse with a cursor that appears on screen.  It is a little difficult for me to get it calibrated.  Sometimes I end up pointing at the floor or way off the left side of the television display. I think I have learned how to center it now. I have to shake it while pointing at the middle of the screen.  I really wish they offered a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse option. That would have been perfect. The virtual keyboard entry method is very slow. The more I explore, the more stuff I find. I wish they had a good user manual, but they don't.  There is a simple on-screen manual that is next to useless by the time you find it.  By then, you've already learned a lot of stuff by trial and error. They did not make any attempt to explain how to use what they call the apps (internet interface). You are on your own to discover how to use it. Many people will do just fine doing that, but there are many things for which I would like to read an explanation. Not everything is obvious. You are asked to activate things with no idea of what to expect ahead of time. But so far, so good. There is firmware update option available.  I checked and my television is already to the latest revision. The manufacturing date is only last month (March 2012), so I guess it can't be too far out of date. It was assembled in Mexico. I registered my television on their web site. It is so new that this model is not even listed yet. But you can type the model number into the apace provided.And the television sensitivity is nothing short of outstanding. I went into my garage and found a compact loop antenna and connected it to the television. The antenna is sitting on the floor on the first level and the nearest television stations are in Houston, 50 miles away.  And it picked up 30 stations. I watched a television program that was obviously a 2D image and turned on the simulated 3D just to see how well it would work.  It definitely depends on the scene, but sometimes it is just almost impressive how well this works. Obviously it is nowhere near as good as a true 3D image, but not too bad, all things considered.The LG 3D image system uses passive polarized glasses. I was pretty much in the active shutter camp until I got this television. I really cannot find any fault with it other than the 3D glasses do attenuate the light somewhat - like polarized sunglasses. The viewing angle is good. I sat on both ends of a long couch and it still looked the same. You can even adjust the amount of 3D effect you desire. Since the glasses are lightweight, I was able to wear my prescription eye glasses and just slipped the 3D glasses over the front.  It works just fine doing it this way. And it was reasonably comfortable, virtually little difference than just wearing my prescription glasses. A few weeks ago, I watched a 3D movie from a very expensive Sony projection setup using active shutter glasses. I think this LG 3D television works just as good (if not better) and without the expense and weight of the active shutter glasses. The active shutter glasses were heavy and I found them quite uncomfortable after about half an hour. And active shutter glasses are very expensive. With this LG television they really do include six pair of 3D glasses. I will not be tempted to buy a projector system because the picture is washed out in comparison to this LG 3D television. The black level is so much better with this LG.I really wish I could have gotten the 55 inch version of this television. I have a 65 inch plasma television upstairs and this 47 inch television is a lot smaller. But while it isn't lightweight, I carried by myself from the bedroom where I assembled it to the living room without much effort. I do suggest you assemble it on a bed with the face down.  The base comes in two pieces. First you mount the two pieces together with 4 screws. Then you mount the two-piece assembly onto the base of the TV with the remaining four screws. The stand seems quite sturdy to me. I tried to tilt it back and forth to test it - plenty stable. You can mount it on a wall, but that hardware is not included, as you would expect.When you find an internet site you want to keep, it does support bookmarking it. And there is a clear history and cookies option, too. It remembers your log-on ID and passwords for Netflix and other sites. Again, I really wish they had included a wireless keyboard and mouse option. The air mouse (remote control) is a little frustrating to use. The pointing accuracy is sometimes really bad. You have to shake the remote while pointing at the center of the screen fairly often to re-center the cursor.  And you will frequently be pointing well past the television set or even at the floor to move the cursor to the desired spot. Maybe I will learn how to use it better with practice. I cannot find any text to tell you how to calibrate it. It appears the documentation is seriously lacking. Maybe they were in a rush to get this on the market and hopefully the documentation is playing catch-up.  But somehow I really doubt that they even considered writing a true user's manual. I consider this a significant issue.I truly wanted to show my loyalty to LG by buying a LG 3D Blu-ray DVD player.  But the specifications and user reviews led me to purchase a Panasonic brand. Unfortunately, the Panasonic is wireless G. That really annoyed me today when I set it up.  At least the LG television is wireless N. I wish LG would have directly listed Amazon Prime streaming video to watch movies. I haven't had a chance to see if I can go to the Amazon web site to play a movie yet. I will update this review as I have more time and experience with this LG 3D television.In summary, I wholeheartedly recommend this 3D television as an excellent television value and technological marvel. I was truly amazed to learn how well they have integrated networking and internet access into this television. Televisions and computers have finally merged with the introduction of this model. The more I used it, the more it felt like a computer with a big screen - yet it is also a very good 3D high definition television.  Almost forgot to mention that there is no bezel surrounding the glass display.  I think that is a major reason I thought it looked smaller. The picture image goes almost to the edge of the glass screen, perhaps to within three-eighths inch from the edge. All I can say is that I am now a 3D believer and LG has designed a very forward looking masterpiece. If you can afford it, I strongly recommend the 55 inch size.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for quality, functionality and price", "Author": "Frank D Miceli", "ReviewID": "RO59JSZN8KI9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A friend purchased the LG 55LM8600 and recommended it to me.

I found other posts on the web describing the exact same problem.It is too bad because I am not sure I can find an equal value replacement eaisly.UPDATE 4/16: I didn't have enough time to debug it thoroughly but I believe a factory reset eliminated the problem.

I only have it for a week now but i can tell that i wont have any problems with it. The 3D is amazing, maybe is not the best 3D out there but for 2013 and for that price is perfect. The 2D is also really nice and clear. The remote control is something different than the usual ones but i really like it. Basically every time you move your remote, a (pc) point appears on the screen and then you just guide the point with the remote. I dont know how good it would work if you have your tv really far from you, but mine is 5m and it works really good. Some other features on the tv are: Internet browsing (no flashplayer though, but i don't know for sure.), Netflix, hulu, fb and other apps, wireless wi-fi connection, pc streaming, passive 3D with 6 glasses, and 2D-3D converter but it seemed that it sucks. Overall, i would recommend this tv to anyone who doesn't want to pay a-lot for a good tv. i researched it a-lot before buying it and i just came to the conclusion that for this price it was the best choice, and i believe i was right.

This build was from August. Very minor edge leak in the upper right corner and across the top...barely noticeable. Extremely happy with this TV!I used a calibration from the AVS forum and it's spot on. That in conjunction with the other settings give you a multitude of options for detail and color. The picture is the best I've ever seen! I went from a 6 year old top of the line Sony XBR LCD to this and all I can say is WOW!!! The 3D on Black OPs 2 is amazing! Much better than the active 3D in my opinion. My buddy has the Samsung 7000 and I like the LG better. Both are good sets though.It was between this, the 7600, and 9600. Glad I went with the 8600. The 9600 never got down to the price I wanted and this 8600 used was well under the 7600 new. I like the black metal bezel with the gun metal silver across the lower front as opposed to the silver bezel on both the other tvs. This tv looks absolutely amazing mounted to the wall. The screen is fairly glossy but almost all high end tvs have gone to this. Not as glossy as some others I've seen though. Wouldn't mind a semi-matte screen instead but the glossier screens make the colors pop more. Would highly recommend!Note**The Magic mouse remote was a good idea but sucks! The pointer gets lost all the time so you have to shake the remote to center it again. I can deal with that, but what I can't deal with is the poor placement of buttons! Whatever tech thought it was a good idea the put the menu button at the very bottom right hand corner should be fired. You have to use that button all the time to access input choices, apps, etc. There is a ton of room at the top of the remote where your thumb lies for multiple buttons. There's also tons of room on the bottom where your fingers are for more buttons. I like the vertical track ball in the middle for scrolling but that's about it. They failed here.

I'm not very technical when it comes to rating electronics, but I know what I like. Here are the likes:- The 3D glasses: Compared to my other (Samsung) 3D glasses which are active, these passive glasses are much more comfortable. There are no worries about the batteries dying mid-movie and there is no annoying flutter in my peripheral vision. They are just as effective, too. And, of course, the price is much better. The TV is in my bedroom so I'll probably never need six pairs of glasses. (Insert crude jokes here.)- The picture: Gorgeous. Both Blu-ray movies and HD TV look beautiful and crisp. I have Time Warner cable and the TV and cable work together beautifully. I've watched 3D Blu-ray movies, too, and have absolutely no complaints.- The internet: Looks great but it's hard to maneuver to sites due to the tedious input method. (Below)- The look: Nice and sleek. I wasn't happy with the stand and have since mounted the TV on a wall. (Don't try to do this yourself -- it's REALLY heavy!!)- Audio is okay for being built-in. My living room TV's audio passes through an amplifier and has surround sound; this is fine for the bedroom.What I don't like:- TiVo has an app called THX optimizer. I was unable to do much with it since the TV's menu covered the background. It was impossible to make adjustments since I couldn't see the background. It would be nice if the box containing the menu items could be moved to the side somehow.- The remote: It may be the worst remote I've ever used, and probably the one thing that takes away a star. It's hard to keep steady and is very similar to a Wii remote. Most options are reached through the menu -- the remote itself has very few buttons. So, for example, to set the sleep timer takes several steps. It's also difficult to point to the letters when inputting information on internet sites. Because of that, I rarely surf the internet on the TV. Don't feel bad for me; I have enough other options.

TV looks great out of the box, unfortunately this will be going back to the store for a refund.  I really wanted to love this TV, like many of the other reviews that I recently discovered after my problem, I'm afraid that I have the same issue.  I would have kept it if there were solutions to the \"ghosting\" or image trails during \"action\" movements, it doesn't even have to be fast action.  The ghosting trails would happen even if it was slow moving, when a person would walk across or turn their head.  I could have lived with the screen reflection, but this ghosting really really really bothers me.  It's odd though, if I have it on \"Standard\" mode, and toggle it to another mode, ghosting starts to happen.  Even if I toggle back to Standard, it still exists.  But if I just leave it on Standard and never toggle it, it seems fine.  You would think that the 240 Hz would prevent ghosting blur, but there is some quality control that LG needs to improve on, because this was my first LG purchase, and it might be my last, unless LG gets 4-5 stars 99% of the time for their next set.I was hoping to get a set that the other 4-5 Star reviews had, it looks like I'm in that population within 1-2 stars.

This is my 1st Edgelit LED as my 55in LG LH90 is full backlit LED and the reasoning I prefer not to have Edgelit LED has to do with the very common light bleeding or ghosting as some call it. This only happens usually during dull black load screens. So true black load or still screens do not suffer from this light coming through effect around the border where the edgelit LEDs are. Since Lg started using Local dimming technology and different modes to change how the LEDs are dimmed in certain areas when needed, this allows for much better and deeper black levels. LG has been known to meet \"THX certified\" as my LG LH90 and the industry ISF calibrations which speak of the high concentration they have on picture quality. It is truly sad that some manufacturers have slacked off in the most important attribute in what makes a great TV, by focusing on smart TV apps,games, and other non-essentials. Its great that this TV has all that and a very nice UI, but it's NOT what makes the TV amazing! Even the magic remote is pretty sweet and I find it very user friendly (which i was skeptical about using a knock off Wii remote) but it is missing a key button such as input select and picture/sound adjustment menu. Granted these are still fairly easy to get to with basically 2-3 clicks but would be great if they were 1 button clicks!The 6 3D glasses included are ok but the Gunnar 3D glasses are superior in every way--Bestbuy has them for 29.99 (regularly 59.99) in store.Also would recommend getting the 21Gbps Monster 3D HDMI cables as they improve the 3D experience by getting rid of crosstalk/ghosting artifacts.

Really thrilled with this deal at first glance.After mounting it and turning it on, I was just as impressed.  Picture is great, connected to my home network easily.  Even the odd magic remote is starting to grow on me.  There's also a great Android app to use your phone or tablet as a remote as long as both are on the same wifi network.  The only negative I've seen is the standard light bleed from the edge lit LED, but it's consistent or better than other models in the same category.  I don't expect my SUV to get 40mpg or my hatchback to give me 200hp, so I won't expect my edge-lit LED to not have a tiny bit of light bleed on the edge.Passive 3D is great, and the 2D to 3D conversion is surprisingly solid.  This is the way that 3D should be done, and LG is leading the way.  Some Toshiba and Panasonic sets seem to be using some of the same tech, but the extra money spent on the LG is well worth it, especially if you can get a steal through a Amazon Warehouse deal.  Already owned a 42LM6200 for the bedroom and this 55\" is a great addition to the living room.For some reason people are rating the 8600 lower than the 7600.  I don't think it's due to any real issues, I think it's that the higher end buyers are expecting absolutely perfection and the lower end buyers appreciate how great these TV's are.  Do not be discouraged, this is a great opportunity to get a better TV for the same or lower price.

But, after few days I got a confirmation from Amazon that my TV will be shipped by July 5th and I will receive by July 6th. Apparently, I got suspicious of quality of the item I am going to receive. As worried, I got a package from UPS which doesn't look like a new TV package. I told UPS the same and he said I have to talk to amazon if any issues with the product. UPS guy said he will note down that package is damaged. And when I opened the TV and plugged it, what I see is only a white, black and gray lines on the screen with black mountains at bottom of the screen. It's exactly similar to what happened to my laptop screen when it was broken. Then I checked around the TV for any damages, I found a big dent back of the TV. Then I called immediately Amazon and asked for replacement, they responded with a new replacement order. I am waiting for the new one now. I will post updates when I receive the new one.______________________________________________________________________________July 17th, 2012I have received new tv few days back as a replacement for my damaged one. So far, I like this tv and no automatic restart problems as most of the ppl complained. I believe this is something to do with overheating of TV when it's 'ON' for long time (yes, tv getting up super heat if its running for longtime). As I haven't hooked my TV to a wall mount, its working good, i guess... otherwise I may also have same issue.I also observed lip sync problem between audio and video when playing blu-ray 3d dvd, but its not that significant.Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the TV for the price I paid. I concur all the good things ppl posted here. It's almost like a computer but not exactly :).... I tried to watch some HD videos in Youtube which is of 60 mins length, didn't work (its working great for small length videos). Its too slow to load the program even though my internet speed in 10mpbs. The problem is, when the picture stops then there is no way to go back and you need to switch off the TV. Anyway, I can live with that when comparing with all other features it has got. There can be lot of improvements LG can make, hopefully they should all be easily downlaodable.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lg lm8600 Overall solid tv", "Author": "Jahn V", "ReviewID": "RI1P091LNGTVQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I love this tv. I am coming from a 2yr old Samsung led 55in tv (I don't remember the model) and I can say this is a great tv in comparison.First the negatives. Like most edge lite led tvs my tv suffers from bleeding. As far as how bad, not bad at all. It only bleeds a little from the bottom left corner. Isn't bad when movies are playing only really noticeable when switching from input to input or home screen. Next is the HDD playing feature. While this is an amazing feature (plays even .mkv files) its draw back is subtitles. Half the time they work, the other half they don't. While I don't need subtitles for every movie I would like to watch avatar and see the parts where subtitles are needed to understand what's said. Minor but it is annoying. The magic remote is a draw back for me too. I have a harmony remote but wanted to give the remote two weeks. It shines in some spots but lacks big in others. One big lack is the fact that it doesn't have a play pause feature on it. Takes about 3-5 secs to be able to pause Hulu or Netflix or even your hard drive. Also any slight movement of the remote and the curser comes on the screen. Another annoying factor minor but annoying is if you use Hulu or Netflix or playing from your hard drive, you can't access the full menu or picture or sound. For example, I was using Hulu and there is an episode that the audio is out of sync. Now the tv has a feature the can sync the audio with the video but you can't access it from Hulu. It is only available with inputs. As to why I have no clue.Now to the positives. The picture quality is amazing on this tv. Blacks are pretty black for a led tv. I calibrated it to my liking and it works great. Surprisingly the speakers on this tv are not bad at all. I had to use them for two weeks until I could get my speakers out of storage. Netflix and Hulu both work flawlessly for me. I've had no issues with setting it on wifi. A real nice feature that I have to say wasn't even expected is streaming from my computer to the tv. It's so simple to use and so amazing. I don't have to transfer stuff the the hard drive than connect it to the tv to get it to play. I can just go straight from my laptop from the tv. And works with both windows and osx. Another nice feature is wifi screen sharing. And works flawless for me no issues. I love the look of the tv. It is beautiful. And so skinny. The border around the tv is truly small. It takes less room on my wall and seems like it has more screen than my Samsung did. The tv calibrate picture wizard is pretty nice. It isn't a perfect calibrate but it does a pretty good job. I would recommend anyone who buys this tv to calibrate it. You will definitely see the difference. I use the 240hz with the clear plus feature and it works really good. No soap opera effect for me. Now to the 3d. This is my first 3d tv and I am not a big 3d fan. I didn't buy this tv for 3d. But I must say it looks really good on this tv. When converting 2d to 3d it does an okay job. It isn't totally 3d but it's interesting. And it doesn't bother your eyes. Now I played avatar in 3d and wow it was amazing on this tv. I never did see avatar in 3d before and my wife and I were amazed with it. Was like watching a totally different movie. We hated 3d because it would always feel like we would have to look through one eye or the other to get it to work good. With this tv no issue at all.Overall I I've it a solid 4 star. Minus 1 star for the little annoyances and minor light bleed. Hopefully they have a software update to fix some of those issues.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazon IS the place to Buy a TV , Period", "Author": "Movie Fan #2952", "ReviewID": "R1AYW33LH7PGER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello,I gave this LG - 47LM8600 a \" 5 Star \" ratting mostly for Amazon`s service , however I will also state my personal views of this TV as well.The TV is not perfect , if you plan on using this TV for long periods , then you may be \"Out-Of-Luck\".Once the TV as been on a few hours it will start to overheat enough to cause the TV to lose it`s white balance ( the ability to hold proper color and contrast ) , and you will find yourself reaching for the remote to make adjustments that you should not have to make.If you plan on using this TV on a limited basis , then you might be ok for a 2 or 3 hour movie night , and you will be happy with your purchase , however if you plan on watching this TV all day you might find frustration and the end of your viewing time.

It is my opinion that more vent holes or other means of venting the heat build-up would have made a world of difference.Now , you are probably  wondering \" did I keep it \" the answer is no \" and you might also be asking , \" would I buy another LG from Amazon.com if LG changed there design or came out with a cooler running model\" and the answer is \" YES \" .I very much wanted to keep this TV because it was perfect when it was cold , but what good is a TV that you can only watch for a few hours , at least  for me.Now getting to other views , so to speak , the 3D was the best I have seen in a Passive 3D-TV . Yes it was that good.The sound was equally impressive considering you only had to small drivers ( speakers ) making all that sound.The overall design of the TV was also very good and for a TV that thin very solid , and I liked the \"Ribbon Stand\".All in all LG should have done better , and I suspect they will and when they do I will be getting mine from Amazon.Great turn around time and service.Thank you for reading my thoughts and I hoped I have helped.Gary", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice!", "Author": "Shine Pillai \"Shine\"", "ReviewID": "RAFMT3KQFZ3QK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on Sunday and had it wall mounted using the VideoSecu Ultra Slim TV mount (available on Amazon).

Was looking for value, picture quality, and style at less than $1500. This TV meets and exceeds all three of my criteria.  Reviewed Samsung, Sony, and Panasonic models for under $1500, however, they were not even close in comparison to this TV unless you wanted to spend much more money.  I previously purchased online a 56\" Samsung LED DLP six years ago.  That Samsung TV had a matte screen finish and a fabulous picture \"when it worked.\"  Thank God I bought a 4 year warranty back then.  I had constant problems and repairs after year one from inadequate and undersized capacitors which caused significant startup and audio problems.  I paid  $1900 for that Samsung and at year six the main light engine malfunctioned.  With all this new TV technology, I would recommend  purchase of a  4 or 5 year warranty.  As for this LG television, I haven't calibrated it yet, but use the Intellisensor which adjusts the picture automatically to the light in your room.  Seems to work very well!  The picture quality is fabulous and 3D is sensational.  The 2D to 3D conversion works okay, thought not as good as straight 3D.  The sound from the speakers for a thin TV is good enough.  I have an old Belkin 2.4Ghz router wired directly with a CAT5 patch cable to the TV Ethernet port.  The TV connected to the router almost seamlessly and the SMART functions off the internet work fine.  I had no problems using the \"magic\" remote.  Glare on the TV screen depends on the placement.  I have a 22 X 22 great room with 4 large windows and glare on the TV screen is almost non-existent.  I also purchased a 5-year warranty.

But a few annoyances and a quality problem force me to rate it 3 stars.- The first TV from amazon arrived undamaged but had a dead zone of pixels in the corner. Not a couple dead pixels, but an oval area in the corner about 1\" by 1/2\" (I assume this was a TV quality problem, not shipping damage as the box was in great shape). Amazon sent a new TV immediately. The second TV was actually bent across the middle during UPS shipping and was also returned (no fault of LG). I was prepared for even more shipping carnage when the third box arrived, but to my surprise it was in perfect shape.- Volume adjustment is too coarse at the low end of the range. When watching TV at night when others are sleeping I try to keep the volume low. But it is frustrating how one click of the volume button is the difference between too loud and too soft. This is annoying but not a deal-breaker.- I like the Magic Remote and how it responds to motion inputs. But the volume Up/Down and channel Up/Down buttons have no shape, no texture and no bumps. They are virtually indistinguishable from the plastic shell of the rest of the remote surface. It takes a few seconds of fumbling around to make sure your thumb is on the right location. It's not a big deal - I'll be gluing a small black plastic bump to the \"up\" buttons to improve useability - but it's annoying nonetheless. The original Magic Remote that came with my TV has a bad button that doesn't click like all the other buttons on the remote. LG is replacing it. I hope they come through.All the comments about light bleed at the edges seem overblown to me. If you watch a grey screen you can see it, but I have never noticed the light bleed while watching real programming.Overall I am still very happy with the TV and wouldn't want to give it up.

The display is crystal clear, in both 2D and 3D.  The sound quality is a big upgrade from my previous 32\" Samsung, but I'd still like to invest in surround sound in the near future.  I actually like the remote even though some people's reviews were critical (if you have played Nintendo Wii before you will understand the motion control).  There are lots of settings for the TV, and I am still learning how to best use them all, but seem to be flexible for different needs (cable, movie, gaming, etc.).  Also, the overall design of the unit itself is very impressive and is the sleekest looking TV I have seen.Now a few notes on the defect.  When I first purchased this item from Amazon's reseller Vann's, the unit arrived in good condition but there was a group of 'stuck' pixels on the far righthand, center of the screen and another group of 'dead' pixels in the lower lefthand corner of the screen.  Despite troubleshooting (offered by Amazon's 30 day tech support) the 'dead' pixels remained while the 'stuck' pixels were able to be massaged out with an eraser.  I returned the unit to Vann's for a direct replacement.  This replacement unit had the same 'dead' pixels in the lower lefthand corner that could not be remedied.  I returned this unit as well.  I was refunded by Vann's and ordered another 47LM8600 from Adorama Camera.  This third unit arrived yesterday and is in perfect condition.  I'm glad I kept on pursuing a functional unit with Amazon, Vann's and eventually Adorama Camera as I knew this was the exact 3DTV I have been wanting.

Wanted and LED/LCD type TV - but a good picture and price. Our LG plasma has been flawless.3. Wanted a thin TV with a good picture for 3D and wanted it to be passive this time. we have the active 3D downstairs.So far the 8600 has meet our expectations and exceeded some. Once we got the picture calibrated CNET review.... its all been very good.TV is lightweight - we're currently using the TV stand but have plans to mount it on an articulating bracket once we can modify the TV cubby.Remote is their magic remote. our first experience w/ the magic remote was with our plasma (2010), used it twice and stored it.since this was the only remote, had no choice. It was easy to use and get the 8600 updated (firmware), online - Ethernet and change settings for calibration. but since then we only use the remote to turn on the TV since we have DirecTV and use that remote for the channels plus have a Harman Kardon receiver that we use for volume etc. most likely we'll be setting one or both of those up as universal remotes. only make sense.we only used the audio speakers on the 8600 for two weeks, decent sounding but not going to fill the room. we use our Harman Kardon as the workhorse now. once you go HDMI and the receiver the 8600 speakers become inop.the good news - a decently strong person can lift the set by themselves to set it in position or move it to make changes. the picture is good, 3D is decent, not eye popping like active 3D does but good enough for our living room and much cheaper with almost free 3D passive glasses.con - not much we can say.... wish I had got the 55\" but the extra few hundred would have put me in the dog house especially when the TV would not have fit inside the tv cubby.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than my Samsung ES8000 though", "Author": "Jeffery B.

Amazon had it for cheaper. I was attracted to its design and colors quality right away. This is a SMART TV that is not so smart after all. Overall, all TV manufacturers offer limited amount of Apps and not to compare with your Ipad or Android tablet. So if you are looking for a TV that acts like a tablet or a PC; you'll have to wait for another 2 to 3 years before you can fully take advantage of the technology. LG SMART Apps do perform as designed. The dual processor however is still slow and do not expect a fast ms respond after you push the enter button. the TV does take couple seconds before responding to your request.Out the box, the TV needs calibration to get the best picture. Check out websites that offer the best configuration. 3D works really well on this TV and you get 6 passive glasses.Pandora App does not work or at least for me. It opens with no issues but the main screen remains hanging and cannot navigate. it is useless. Nothing to blame LG for which they don't write the code for the Apps. Hopefully, a new patch will fix the issue.I highly recommend this TV if you are looking for all the nice features at somewhat cheap price. Samsung 8 or 9 series was my first choice but too expensive. this LG offers all the goodies for a fraction of the cost.one letdown however is the magic remote.

Not sure why thee would be so many negative reviews as I am very happy with this Model and have not experience any problems. The picture is excellent, although overall Samsung and Sony are slightly better, albeit overpriced. I was a little disapointed at the 3d at first until I realized that it is more the source than the TV. I was watching ESPN 3d and was underwhelmed until a fan in the stands threw up their hands in front of the camera and it made me jump. My children love the 3d feature and that is realy the only reason why I considered a 3d television. Young children have a better perception of 3D (you can look it up) And Its funny seeing them try to reach out and grab the images. They say that active 3D is better but I don't see it that way. The passive 3D glasses are much more comfortable and cheaper to replace. ACtive 3D glasses are heavier need batteies and use a \"shutter\" system to maipulate your eyes perception. I tried this out in the store and it gave me a headache. Some people are sensitive to this so I believe that passive is generaly more comfortable all around.The picture is crisp and sharp, I do not notice any bleeding or deficiencies that other reviews have referanced. The sound is ok, but I did'nt expect much anyway.The internet browser is fast and acurate, almost as fast as my laptop, however the apps are terrible and very limited: very substandard compared to virtualy any other smart tv.However I use my playstation for video streaming so it's not a big deal. I also found it nearly impossible to link my Iphone/ Ipad to this tv without installing a bunch of unwanted third party apps and subscriptions, so I gave up on this. This is Apple's fault not the tv however. the Apple company doesn't like to share with anyone else's platform and I have run into these problems frequently. An Android or Windows phone should work better.And linking my windows laptop was a easy by comparison.The remote is a nice feature and operates much like a WII controler, but with far better control. It is very easy to use and I was able to sync with my cable box which eliminates the need for shuffling remotes.Overall I would have given five stars if the apps were better, however I would highly recommend this TV.ProsExcellent pictureAbility to manipulate 3d image2D to 3D conversion works wellExcellent refresh rate of imagesInnovative remote control, that has a voice command feature for internet browsing and search commands.Quick web browsing.Reasonable pricePassive 3DNetflix appIncludes six pairs of glassesInstall and setup is easy and quickConsApps are terrible and very limited and the app store is a joke.

If someone posts something on their wall, you can see what they wrote, but not what they posted.... useless.- Youtube: Try to load a video, most videos do not work and you spend 20 minutes being redirected to a next video, then a next one... I don't get it.- Netflix: Basic, not even the subtitle feature you get on a 4 year old xBox- Games: I just don't know where to start, they recycled Games that probably existed on the first connected TV sets 10 years ago.- Internet: The worst Internet browsing experience you will ever have.You get the point, no effort was made to make this TV Smart or fast. Get an Xbox or Apple Tv.2d to 3d: Really ? Try it, tell me what you think.3D: I just tried the free 3D Korean Videos that came with the TV... Cool if you are watching a 3 min Video, don't think I would enjoy a movie, would end up having a headache or seeing double for a while But this is personal.Dual Play: Ok, this is pretty cool  if you are 2 (You must get special glasses to play this). Not perfect, but cool. You will get a headache quick and it is not fun if someone else is spectating the game, since they won't see anything (except if you get more Dual Play Glasses)All in all, I think the best thing is to get a very good TV and leave the Smart features to Apple or a connected PC or Game Console.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super thin bezel.

I tried watching The Lorax, and the colors are bright and vibrant. The detail is sharp.  Because this TV has an IPS screen, it looks good even when viewed from an angle.  I love the super thin bezel--only 1cm wide.  This, as well as the thinness on the side (1.6cm at the edge), give the LM8600 a very sleek, modern look.  Because the glass goes all the way to the edge, the TV looks completely borderless when off.  The screen is rather glossy, but glare and reflections haven't been a problem.This TV is very responsive.  It powers up in a couple seconds. Menus navigate quickly. This is likely due to the dual-core processor, and it is very much a welcome improvement over the sluggishness I'm used to with my Tivo.  The strange remote that comes with the TV is pretty intuitive and even fun to use, but a traditional remote would also have been welcome.I haven't had a chance to really dig into the many options available, but I have used the Netflix and Tivo apps.

No edge bleeding that I can tell yet and the blacks are deep and rich. Setup was a snap and there are more then enough applications to support what I will use the set for. I have to say that there are 2 issues: first is that the set is glossy as hell. It's in our main room which has floor to ceiling windows and the set is like a mirror unless you swivel it away from the windows, which we can. The other gripe I have is that Netflix looks comparably worse on this set when played directly through their ap then it does either via the Xbox or PS3. So neither are a big deal and the quality of the picture and overall look of the set make this a good value.Also, the 3D is AMAZING.

So I returned the call in less than 15 minutes of receiving it and was told they WON'T honor what they said on my voicemail and would only replace parts. So at this point I would say to you I would be leery of LG's customer service policies. I may have gotten a lemon but that doesn't exclude them from keeping their word. A formal complaint has been files with the BBB.UPDATE: Well the TV is a little over 5 months old now and I already had 1 major problem resolved and 1 major problem still unresolved. 1st problem was that after a firmware update the TV lost all ability to connect to any network. Apparently these devices won't allow for a firmware downgrade so LG had a technician replace the mainboard which resolved that issue. 2nd problem arose a fewweeks later. TV now drops the video/audio signal and displays only a grey screen with no audio. I tried multiple HDMI cables (3) and different signal sources plus different HDMI ports but replicated the problem each and every time. Now I am resorting to shutting the TV down 5-7 times daily to get a signal.Parts are on back order for so I asked for a replacement TV. Waiting to here from LG about this. When it works the image IS fantastic but only when it works. I will update again once I hear back from LG. I have had this now for a little over a week and I am extremely impressed with the picture quality. Friends that otherwise thought that 3D on a home TV set was nothing more than a gimmick found themselves saying \"WOW\" when I introduced them to my 47LM8600. Some reviews complain of bleeeding of the backlight but if you pay careful attention to most of those complaints it seems that this happens only when there is no signal being received.

The TV arrived when scheduled and the delivery crew did an efficient, accurate and careful unpack and setup. The LG Cinema Screen 55LM8600 55\" LED/LCD 3D TV performed perfectly in every way.

The Bose provides theatre-quality sound that has a richness you have to hear to believe.The LG's passive 3D glasses provide excellent 3D. They are the same as the glasses you receive when you go to a 3D movie. I used a number of 3D BluRay disks to test the system. I particularly liked watching Avatar and a variety of unbelievable 3D IMAX movies.The Magic Wand remote control takes some getting used to. If your hand shakes at all, it is hard to keep the cursor on screen objects in order to click on them. However, with practice you will get better at using it.The picture is beautiful, with deep blacks and crisp colors.

You have to use two remotes( LG + Universal) unless you don't want to use your TV remote other than to switch on and off3. LG apps suck. No premium apps like Amazon and stuff.

As a photographer I knew how to use the Advanced controls and was very happy with the result after tweaking.  I also went through the Automated picture setup just for kicks, and I was very impressed with the improved color it gave.  There are man ways to get the color you want out of it. If you have a problem with the color of this TV, you have no one to blame but yourself.2-BLACKS: Brightness, contrast, back-light, and other custom controls help you improve the blacks.  Again, the automated process does a great job as well.  Not a concern for me anymore.3-THE REMOTE: yeah...but its a remote.  even if it was completely worthless, i wouldn't give it too much weight in any review; after all, I bought a TV, not a remote.  It is true, they should have put an Input button on there; they shouldn't have made it so curvy that it won't stay top-up; they should have put a motion sensor Off button on there so the red arrow cursor doesn't come up on screen every time you twitch a muscle!  I had to get used to setting the thing down away from me, instead of keeping it handy on the couch.  Annoying, yes, but I forgive LG as long as they keep the TV itself awesome...fix the remote though please.4-240 hrz:  Huge difference in everything I watch!  I thought this feature might just be a marketing dealyo, but nope, it's legitimately a cool thing to have.

I recieved the bluray in 2 days since Im prime but after setting it up it did no turn on. Yes i was upset but its not their fault these things happen so they offered to refund me the $300 it cost so i basically could have gotten the TV for $1700 give or take. But i said no send me another LG home theater...I got it the next day they gave me free one day shipping for the inconvenience! After the easy setup it worked flawlessly. I put the 5 year warranty on the tv from LG through amazon for $179 because the tv is not valued at $2000 it was cheaper that way.

But before I get ahead of myself let me get started with the basics: The TV came shipped & packed in the LG box that you can see in the costumer photos above- My TV was packed well and was very easy to take out of the box and organize all the stand parts, manual, controller and even the batteries and screws. (The controller did come with its own batteries, and the stand had screws provided) I am most impressed with the extra plastic/safely grips on the sides of the TV- for it made removing it from the box SO much easier but also protected the sides/screen during shipment. Setting up the stand was so very easy, but I would recommend doing it with two people especially after you assemble the two body parts of the stand and then need to screw the stand to the TV directly. Hubby was so very excited about getting a new 'toy' that he wanted to set up everything himself but after looking at the manual (I do suggest you read over the manual- even for those of you who would consider yourself very tech-savvy. Hubby is the one person in our home who is the wiz when it comes to cables and hooking up new devices but he was even surprised on some of the things this TV can do. The manual goes into detail about some of the new hookups (located in the back- ie HDMI to computer etc.) that he personally found the manual to be very insightful and even had information that he didn't know) he found that it would be safer to have me help him with the stand. Total time for stand and TV setup without turning the TV on: 10min! This might seem a little long but we adjusted the screen to fit our viewing pleasure, cleaned off our TV stand, and got all of our external devices ready to be plugged in after we get the TV turned on and set up. We honestly had some trouble getting our satellite dish working with the TV- we have DIRECTV w/DVR and couldn't get any signal from our dish. Even when we went through the channel search and lineup process we were told that 'NO Channels' were found- it wasn't until we went and hit the input setting area and selected 'HBMI 1' that our satellite dish worked. Other than this snag setup of the TV and the magic wand was simple and painless. The magic wand reminds me of the Wii remote- so we were both use to the style and had no issues controlling it. The only problem we have with this style of remote is that it is not compatible with out universal TV controller. In other words- we now have to use 2 TV controllers to work our TV. It is a pain because if I want to adjust the volume I have to use this one but for channel changing I have to use the other. But I can see why you are not able to get rid of the magic wand in place of the universal controller- for it is a whole different type of remote where your hand moves the controller. Going through the set-up process of picking your time zone, daylight saving etc. was very easy and only took us another 10min or less to complete altogether. Setting up your Wi-Fi was very simple and it reminded me of when I was setting up my computer Wi-Fi for it does have the same format. You pick the name of your Wi-Fi then enter your password and you're done! It was that easy! I really enjoy the fact that this TV has built in Wi-Fi and that all my devices can be on the same network + that they can all share video and pictures while being on the network! While I was messing around with the all the extras this TV can do I was really getting the feeling of how much this reminded me of a computer and then I thought: I want to see if I can really pull stuff from my computer to my TV via Wi-Fi... so I did! I pulled some videos that I had stored on my mac, it was simple and easy! I even pulled some videos that I had uploaded to my mac from a trip I took that I had shot from a little handheld video camera- and let me just say how amazing these came out. I was worried that they would come out fuzzy because of the size but the picture was clear and now I can pull up all of my home videos onto the big screen to share and enjoy on this new TV! But that's not all: I can watch them all in 3D! Awesome!There are also tons of apps that can be added and viewed from your TV: We were giddy just looking at all the different things we can view and do! We started with Netflix and Hulu+ but I can foresee hours of looking up apps and even more hours of entertainment just from this TV alone.While watching regular TV our picture is crystal clear, sharp, and just beautiful! I am amazed at the detail that we can see and how sharp the colors are. I switched out a Toshiba LCD for this TV (the Toshiba is currently now sitting in my bedroom) and the colors are so much more vivid and sharp when I compare the two of them. One of the minor things that I have really enjoyed and 1st noticed right when we turned it on is that my Toshiba has a black bar or cover holding the TV screen in place vs. the LG is ALL screen! Let me just say what a difference this makes when viewing and if you're really in the market for a new TV I have to highly suggest you get a screen that goes out all the way without any types of bars. What is truly amazing is the fact that you can easily switch from 2D to 3D with just a push of a button. When you hit the 3D button it gives you different options on how you want to view the TV in 3D from standard to split screen. 3D viewing is just as clear and sharp as if you are watching it without 3D, so you don't lose any resolution by watching it in 3D. Comes with 6 pairs of glasses that are very light weight and comfortable to wear. We wore our glasses for a few hours and my ears didn't feel pinched and my eyes were not hurting from long use.What has truly impressed us and sold us 100% on this LG 3D Smart TV (along with all the apps, easy ability to switch from 2D to 3D, and to share a Wi-Fi network with my other devices) is the fact that I stick a regular Blu-ray movie into my Magnavox Blu-ray Home Cinema Surround Sound System and now watch that movie in 3D!!! AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! No 3D Blu-ray player needed!! Just to make sure we tried it on 2 Blu-Ray movies:  Avatar & The Green Hornet and we could watch both of them in 3D perfectly! The screen pops out just as much as it did when we were watching regular TV.  I am so happy because I was talking to hubby about going out to buy a 3D Blu-ray player but now we do not have to! I can't honestly say if this is the case on all 3D TV's but when hubby and I were at Target this last weekend checking out 3D Blu-ray players and asking about clarity of watching it on our TV we were told by the TV tech that to his knowledge when you watch a movie through DVD player onto a 3D TV it will not convert that movie to 3D. Now I'm so happy that we didn't buy that 3D Blu-ray player! But it gets even better: Yes this TV will convert your gaming (we have a PS3) into 3D gaming but when reading about the TV you're told that you need to buy special glasses. Nope! As soon as we hooked the PS3 up it asked us if we wanted to change our settings to allow for 3D and we said yes. Hubby got to play Call of Duty: Black Ops in 3D with the glasses that they provided.  Now for 3D gaming the screen REALLY popped out even more than watching TV. When he was playing the gun fire was flying so clear that it really looked like it was coming straight out of the TV at us.  Hubby said that it made the game harder to play and will take some time to get us to it, but we are excited to try out other games in 3D.Pros:Slim designClear vivid colors and pictureTons of Apps to choose fromAbility to connect other devices through Wi-FiConverts TV 2D to 3DNo need for 3D Blu-ray PlayerDon't need special 3D gamer glassesComfortable 3D glasses includedEasy to setup and customize to youGreat sound qualityCons:Wish I didn't have to use two remotesIn conclusion I am so very thrilled with my LG Cinema Screen 47 inch 3D TV! I am so very happy with everything that it can do and look forward to discovering even more apps as I continue exploring. The quality of TV with picture and sound is just perfect plus the fact that I can easily share contest on my Wi-Fi network just adds to how much I am in love with this TV. The icing on top is the fact that I don't need to go out and buy a 3D Blu-ray player! If I could give it 6 stars I would and highly recommend this brand and exact TV to anyone who is in the market. You won't be disappointed with it!", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stunning, just stunning", "Author": "Ivy", "ReviewID": "R137GNQZT23ZMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture is astounding.  A few friends and I watched Tron: Legacy / Tron: The Original Classic (Five-Disc  Combo: Blu-ray 3D  / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy) on this, and althought I love the movie, I couldn't pay attention to the movie the first time through.  I was too busy staring in awe at the way the clouds in the distant background moved, or the beauty of the image.  I was told passive 3D is an image quality drop from HD because it projects half the image to each eye, but I'm calling that theory out.  This picture is glorious.When it upscales images to 3D it can get a little odd.  I watched Naruto on it, and some moments were astounding, and some were just odd, as Naruto's eyes seemed to deepen into layers. Overall, I like the upscale.  It's an approximation of 3D, but it's a darn good approximation.My boyfriend wears huge glasses and these fit over them perfectly.  On a lark, I put them on over my largest sunglasses, and they still fit, so if you wear glasses, even very large glasses, and you have any concerns that they won't work well with these, stop worrying.As to connectors, there is one input for composite in, but it comes with a three-into-one adapter for that.  The same for component in.  Those are the only cable that come with it, so you will need those.  I suggest AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (9.8 Feet/3.0 Meters) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard] as they are reliable and implement 3D transmission well. There are four specifications for HDMI, 1.4 being the latest, and not every device or cable fully implements the specification.  The signal will downgrade to the lowest component, and with a TV like this, you don't want that component to be your cable.  The difference is substantial.There are four HDMI ports, and it doesn't seem to like connecting to an HDMI switcher. If you have a lot of devices plugged in, and you often find yourself wondering which input the DVD player is using, you'll love this.  First, if a device isn't actively sending a signal, it displays as greyed out, and moves to the back of the list.  Second, you can name your inputs.  You select them from a list (I would have likes to call one Playstation 2, but had to opt for \"Game\") but it helps a lot.The remote is kind of like a Wii controller.  You wave it around and it points at things on the screen you can select.  Very cute.  If you find it hard to use, back up a few steps.  It's counterintuitive, but it works.  The cursor slows down.For streaming it has the standard YouTube, Netflix and Hulu among others.  The only tiny downside is that it doesn't yet support Amazon on demand videos.  Plug in a Roku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player and you're set for streaming entertainment.  I am in the process of replacing my router.  It's in such bad shape that my Pingtest results range from B- to C when connected wirelessly.  Whatever caching the set top does, it can provide perfect clarity even in such adverse conditions.  Good to know if your Internet can have \"off moments\".The energy star note that came on the TV (the yellow tag required by law that you see on all appliances these days) claims that this TV will have an Estimated Yearly Energy Cost of $14 with a range for similar models (45\" - 49\" TVs) going from $18 to $51.  This is \"Based on 11 cents per kWh and 5 hours use per day.\"I wish I could give this 50 stars.

I'll be comparing this TV to my Samsung 46C8000Samsung UN46C8000 46-Inch 1080p 3D 240 Hz LED HDTV. I have read that it takes brand new TV's a little time to break in and most will need further calibration later. My review is for the last few days of using it and will update in in a few months. I'm no expert but just have a passion for great picture quality and try to do research online to help my reviews.The design of the TV is great. The image almost goes to the edge of the screen. It reminds me of the new Apple iMacs. The TV, is of course very thin, and unlike my Samsung there is more metal in the body of the unit. The layout of the HDMI and other ports are in the same spot on the left (when viewing the TV). After unboxing the TV, you have to attache an attachment that screws to the tv itself. After doing that you can attach it to the stand, which I had problems with on the inner left corner, the screw just didn't want to catch. I finally got it though but there may be a manufacturing issue with the drill hole.After getting the TV all plugged in and situated, I started the initial setup which was very, very easy. There is a great step by step guide that walks you thru the process using the \"Magic Motion Remote\" (which i'll get to later), and also gets you setup on your wifi too. Once the setup was done I began viewing some shows that I watch all the time to get a sense of the picture quality to begin my calibration. Out of the box the settings wer ok but definitely needed some adjustments. If you have any THX labeled dvd, there is an audio/video calibration test that does a decent job to get you started in calibration. So, after I did the tests, I did some final tweaking to get it to where I was happy with.In comparison to the color and sharpness of my Samsung, for this review purpose, I'll rate the Samsung as a 10 and give the LG an 8. I'm sure the TV can be tweaked more by a professional but most of us like to do it ourselves and do not want to pay someone. The samsung is definitely sharper and had better overall skin tones. It also did NOT suffer from compression distortion from the signal. I have Directv and use a good HDMI plug that gave me great quality on the Samsung. I do notice that on the LG that faces have a slight blur to them especially in the eyes and also most text looks jagged. The Samsung out of the box had a much sharper image but needed a few days worth of tweaking to really get the picture quality perfect for my liking. The LG was a little easier in that regard but I can say that the Samsung's image quality does still look better to me. I will continue to make adjustments as I see fit during the TV break-in. There is a built in \"Picture Wizard\" that guides you through the process to calibrate your TV but I found that in my opinion I still needed to really tweak it more using the expert setting where you can really get in there and change each color value specifically like reds, green, blue, magenta, cyan, yellow, green.For audio, there are many settings too like virtual surround etc. I liked that unlike my samsung that has a mono speaker on the back of the unit, LG has stereo speakers on the very bottom and gives it a much better sound. It does make the unit stick out further if your wall hanging because they stick out, but only slightly, most won't even notice his. The over all sound is ok, its no 5.1 or 7.1 but most would understand that.The Magic Motion Remote....well if you've played a Wii, its almost the same exact thing. The remote is just like moving the Wii controller with the arrow pointer to where you want to go/select on the screen. It takes time to get used to and I found that it wandered around the screen making me point it to the floor or ceiling to reach the top or bottom of the screen. I believe your supposed to shake it around to re calibrate the positioning. The select button on the remote is like a mouse wheel and I found it to be too small for my finger and it doesn't really feel like a button so half the time i'm pressing it, it didn't work. I also find that if you put the remote on the sofa near you and you move the motion will activate the mouse (being it works on motion) and then you get the big arrow pointer in the middle of your screen. It gets very frustrating when this happens. I also found that when I was adjusting the image quality you have to keep moving the remote to keep it active or it will time out and you have to start all over again. I much preferred LG's user interface its very Apple iOS inspired and very easy to figure out.There are also set settings that you can tweak a little but I always go right for custom. There is also an option if your a gamer where you can have 2 players play separate screens using a special pair of glasses that are NOT included.3D....even though i've complained a little about the color not being up to MY likings, the 3D is very, very good!. I watch the 3D all the time on my Samsung and there is always ghosting and the battery powered glasses make everything much darker. The LG glasses are lightweight and light tinted. No battery either! you can even use some of the movie theater glasses and it will work. The kit comes with 6 pairs and they are so comfortable not only on your face but on your eyes. I tested them out with Avatar and did a comparison with the Samsung and while they were close, the winner in my opinion was the LG. Reasons were that the glasses didn't make the movie darker and that they were lightweight and you don't see that flicker that the active glasses give. The tv also has links to online movies that are free for various 3D shows, most were underwater ones but they are fun to watch. My Directv has a few channels that are 100% 3D and are great to watch. Oh and unlike the active glasses you do not have to be right in the center of the tv to get the full effect. The LG passive glasses let you sit almost anyplace the tv is viewable and you still get the effect.LG has a ton of apps and other streaming content via wifi or wired. It has all the usual netflix, Facebook, hulu stuff so if you have accounts then your set. Blu-Rays looked amazing on this TV too. Although I watch more satellite tv, the blu-ray's really did look stunning and if your more a movie buff you'll be very happy. There also a ton of options for this Smart Tv including photo albums, and connecting your tablet, pc, mac, usb drive to the tv.The manual was not really a manual. It had no descriptions of all the hundreds of functions and adjustments this TV has on it. What is trumotion or what is mpeg de-noise? Some of us know what they are but many do not and would like to have the manual in front of you to read what things do while making adjustments. There are descriptions of all of these things in one of the onscreen apps. It breaks everything down for you and some of the selections even have a pop out bubble with the info but for me I don't want to have to go thru menu's and screens to find something and then have to go back to another menu to implement the adjustment. I like having the manual in front of me so I can work simultaneously.If your looking for a brand new tv with all the bells and whistles and that has amazing 3D with passive glasses, I think that you will be super pleased with this TV. You will have to do a little calibration on the picture quality but its quite easy.Pros:Super thinSleek modern designExcellent 3D and passive glassesDecent stereo speakersLots of options for picture controlWireless and wired WiFiTons of apps and customizable channels for streamingBlu-Ray movies look superVery energy efficient (5 hrs per day is said to cost only $14 per year to run)Cons:Color calibration takes timeMagic Motion remote is a bit of a pain (should be both a regular remote and have the option to be MagicColors on some shows especially non HD channels look muddyText at times can look pixelated", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "not recommended", "Author": "Esteban Ortiz", "ReviewID": "R51JV2GQP50YV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "two months I only drive well, I went a vertical line in the middle of the screen. very dissatisfied with the product, not recommended.You will not give me warranty", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally bought one.", "Author": "Richard Nowakowski", "ReviewID": "R3NIETSC1ZUZB9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have nothing to add to what everyone else has said.

The TV has its shortcomings, but they are few and far between.What I found that was most impressive was the unit's overall construction. First off, it looks beautiful and feels solidly built for such a thin unit (it measures about 1/2\" thick at the top). The stand did feel a bit cheap and plastic-ky, for lack of a better term. Though, the stand itself gets brownie points because it look cool, not that looks are everything. I think its designers sacrificed functionality for aesthetics here. That said, it seems to hold structurally.Performance is what really matters, and this unit delivers for the most part. The picture is bright with vivid colors, and comes within 1/2\" of the bezel. In full 1080p, coupled with \"TruMotion\" 240Hz technology, the set delivers brilliantly, especially on sports broadcasts such as NASCAR and NBA action. Audio is crisp as well.The unit comes with a 2D to 3D that renders regular broadcasts to 3D content. It's a nice feature, but I found myself not using it very often. Even with the feature off, there is a hint of 3D trying to come out of the 2D picture. A little eye-straining for the sensitive. You will get used to it, though. To fully enjoy 3D, you need a bonafide 3D broadcast or you'll be asking for more eye strain. Definitely not a deal-breaker.Connect this guy to the internet (built-in WiFi, woo hoo!) and you have unlocked a whole new set of features. WiFi is very easy to set up (You need an existing WiFi network.) The app I find most-used is Netflix. There are other bells and whistles which I didn't find as useful, for which you may find hours of pleasure.Now, the remote. At first glance, I thought the \"magic remote\" was pretty cool. It works almost like a mouse with only a few buttons, and is very intuitive. You won't need a Ph.D to figure out how to use it, except if you want to switch your picture from a 4:3 to 16:9. I'd like a single button on the remote for oft-used features instead of having to navigate with a wand. Blame me, I never got my invitiation to attend Hogwarts.So more on the wand: When watching a streaming video, you'll have to point the arrow to the pause button on-screen to pause the video. It's annoying at first, but something that you'll just have to get used to. It doesn't seem as easy to control as, say, a Wiimote (with which I can Wingardium Leviosa with ease, btw). Finally, what happens when this remote gets lost? I am doubtful a universal remote would be able to offer the same features.A quick note on the 3D glasses. Good choice here. No batteries, and they are very light and not as dorky looking as others on the market. They are lightweight and could be seen as a little flimsy, but not much different that something Disney would hand you at Captain E-O.Overall, I give this TV 4 stars. It's beautiful to look at, but exterior aesthetics aren't everything. Picture quality is good. If you're a big sports fan, you'll love it. Set up is easy, and at 240Hz with a Dual Core and built-in WiFi, it's at the top of the heap. Just be wary of the \"novelty\" remote.

Even viewing non 3d programs using the auto 2d to 3d upgrade option was a real surprise as it does add the 3rd dimension to the program with a better quality picture than just viewing it in standard 2d mode. The six 3d glasses (included) are lightweight as this set uses passive 3d so you don't have to batteries and heavy weighted over priced glasses that active 3d sets have. I did not need to change any of the color settings as they are crisp and balanced from the factory settings.

Picture quality is really really great. Great blacks, contrast, color, sound, etc. I always have liked LCD/LED TVs because I mostly watch TV on bright rooms, so they make the perfect match with brightness. Before buying the TV I did some research, mostly reading tons and tons of reviews, and spent time at electronic retailers comparing TVs.Why did I return the TV?Well I am an obsessive person who pay attention to small details and this TV has some:1)When you switch input HDMI/TV/Cable to Home Menu, the screen goes blank and only a pink cursor shows up. During this time is really noticeable a band of light following the mouse (other users have noticed this and called it halo of light). This cannot be noted during the day or bright scenes but during night time, when all lights off, it was really noticeable (e.g. watching Safe House movie, some time on the first minutes there are some dark scenes where the image is mostly black and only the face of a person shows) and annoying.2) Despite the 240Hz and multiple set ups to handle motion actions, the effect on images is not that great. So, most of the time I had this setting OFF.Smart features, internet and apps are great as long as you are not expecting your TV to behave as computer, because it was not meant to be one.So if you are the kind of person that do not care about small details, then this might be the TV for you. Also, price wise is a good deal.Update 6/30/2012I found another post in this thread from other buyer that might help:\"I bought the 55\" LM7600 and I'm glad I did on Amazon! The picture is gorgeous and the 2D-3D conversion while I won't be using it often; was amazing watching baseball games. Old movies and new movies) look phenomenal! I bought the 7600 because I saw more issues with the 8600/9600. No ghosting, no issues with the remote, and absolutely no bleeding.\"", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV!

The picture on it is very sharp and the 3D works really well.  Let me rephrase that, both picture and 3D are awesome.  I was really shocked how good the 3D works no matter where you sit. The wi-fi capability and ability to stream videos directly from the network was really important to me since I have most of my movies on  a network hard drive and it works great (even plays .mkv files which the PS3 does not support).  I am very happy to with the overall performance of the TV.  As mentioned in other reviews and the reason it does not get the full 5 stars is because it does have some small issues (none of which have made me even consider returning the TV), these are 1) glare - our living room has a lot of windows and the TV does have some glare to it.  It does not prevent us from enjoying it, but it is there. 2) Ghosting - with certain TV shows you can see some ghosting.  It does not happen all the time (actually rarely happens), but I have noticed it a couple of times. 3) For some reason at times the video and sound does not match.  There is a feature on the TV which lets you adjust this to sync it.

BROKEN IN LESS THAN 2 MONTHS!", "Author": "TennJen", "ReviewID": "R2SFJ3HNECSS0M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE 8/19/2012 - DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!! We finally got the advertised Skype app in the software upgrade, but after working for a few days, the TV is now non-functional.  Although it clearly is getting power (LED lights flashing everywhere), the TV will not turn on or off...completely black screen and no response from the remote or control buttons. LG could not troubleshoot at all.  Now I have to wait several days (and call the service company myself!) to get service.  Even if they do fix this lemon product, I will never believe that this new technology and/or software was fully tested by LG and will last a normal product length.  The customer service rep's last greeting: \"Thank you for choosing LG\".  Yeah, right.July 2012:  My parents and I purchased this LED TV for a birthday present for my video-gamer son, mainly because of the LG Dual Game mode (which allows 2 people to play games with split-screen capability, but see only his or her screen) and the gamer-friendly apps, like Skype.  I was actually shopping for good plasma TV, but opted to spend about $300 extra for the options advertised on this TV.Despite the Skype logo being depicted all over the LG ads and the box the TV actually ships in, Skype is NOT available on this TV, nor is the Amazon Instant Video app.  Also, the Dual Game mode works, but be ready to shell out additional cash and wait a couple of weeks if you want to use the Dual Game mode. Dual Play glasses are NOT included.  (Kind of a bummer at the birthday party!).  Apps are completely dependent upon the software version that LG decides to send out directly to your TV. You cannot download what they consider \"premium\" apps yourself. Apparently, some customers actually lost Skye from older models when they allowed LG to update the software.  LG claims that Skype will (probably) be available in the next software release, but they have no prediction on the release date (except that is is already late...scheduled for June 30).  Amazon Prime members, forget about getting to Amazon instant videos.  The Amazon Instant Video app has been eliminated entirely (LG has no plans to add it back).  Oh, and IF Skype is ever added, they say you will have to purchase LG's proprietary webcam (about $150) to use it, even though the TV has multiple USB ports and it's own processor.  We already have the X*Box Kinnect camera and several USB web cams.  I guess we'll continue to run everything through my PC, or I'll Google to see what loopholes LG customers have found to work around the many problems.On a positive note, the picture is good (if you like LED pictures) and the LG add-on equipment(home theater receiver/BluRay player, etc.) integrates seamlessly.  The magic remote works like a Wii remote, and it allows you to perform a lot of functions while still watching a program.  Although I'm not thrilled with this TV, I did get a free home theater system in the bundle and 12 pairs of 3D glasses (but not a single pair of Dual Play glasses?!).  However, in the absence of the bundle, I would NOT recommend purchasing this TV, even considering the Dual Play mode (which is pretty neat, but not worth $300).  I've read online that LG gets around the advertising discrepancies by saying, \"read the fine print.\"  Well, I (like many others) think it's deceptive.  I'm definitely not a big LG fan after this.  I remain, however, a big Amazon Prime fan.  The prices were much lower than local retailers, and they pulled miracles to get the TV shipped (ahead of the out-of-stock bundled items) and in time for my son's birthday party.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Satisfied", "Author": "D.

I hope the comments included here are still useful and pray that the replacement unit does not present the difficulties I have experienced with my set. I shall monitor LG 55LA8600 reviews to see if there has been any improvement over its predecessor.The unit was delivered within 7 days of the order.  And it was delivered right in the middle of the two-hour window that was promised.  Before delivery I was called by the truck driver, asking for directions to the house.  When he told me he was driving an 18-wheel truck I informed him I didn't think he would be able to turn onto my street or back into my driveway with it. We agreed to meet at a nearby parking lot, where the unit was transferred to my pickup truck.Warning: Be sure to inquire as to the mode of transportation for such a large item in advance.  There may be complications such as mine.Unpacking the unit was easy. Just cut two straps holding the independent bottom flap onto the box and lift off the top.  The box itself had no bottom.  There were not even flaps on that end.  In order to cover that end cardboard was inserted into the box from the opposite end to serve as the cover.  It was then held in place by the plastic straps, something the average consumer doesn't possess, I suspect.  So, if you decide to send the unit back to Amazon, I suggest you find a package store that has the capability to professionally bind the box.  The other alternative would be to tape the ends shut.  But this could result in a catastrophic event.  It would appear that the vendor was not encouraging product returns.PICTURE:  The picture on this unit, once it is optimized for personal use, is very good.  Since the LG Picture Wizard did not present a favorable result for me, I settled on the \"Vivid\" setting (more on picture quality later).AUDIO:  Speakers in a \u00bd\" flat panel TV cannot be deeper than \u00bd\" if you intend to enforce this width...elementary.  So don't expect very good audio with these units.  I applaud LG's efforts to enlarge the speakers somewhat by enclosing them in a slightly larger housing in the back of the set.  But you still might want to consider adding a sound bar or Home theatre system.  There were several audio effects available, but they were all quite similar, in my opinion.  I settled on the \"Cinema\" effect.3D:  I was interested in learning more about passive 3D technology. I was impressed by the fact that the 6 pairs of included passive 3D glasses required no batteries.  In actual usage, though, I was not so pleased with them.  Initially I was satisfied with the effects while watching Avatar in 3D.  But, after a while, I hardly noticed the 3D effects at all.  It all seemed to be rather \"ho-hum\".  And I understand video resolution is reduced with these glasses.  I had hoped to experience some \"reach-out-and-touch\" scenes. But that did not happen. I had experienced better effects while testing a scene with active 3D glasses on a display at a warehouse.APPS:  Personally I don't find the Apps to be very interesting.  I find them to be, primarily, vehicles for marketers to sell music and videos.  Anyway, I have enough movies on DVDs at this time to keep me busy.  I do wish the text under the \"My Apps\" icons on the bottom of the screen were larger.  As it is now it seems to be a vision test.  I would prefer fewer and larger apps on each page, with another page added to fulfill the apps list. But then, my vision is not 20/20.MAGIC REMOTE:  The introduction of the Magic remote is a bold initiative by LG.  I know of no other TV manufacturer who employs this concept.  The novelty of aiming a laser beam at the TV to initiate commands stirred my curiosity at first.  But soon I lost interest in it and now prefer a standard universal remote.  To me these questions are pertinent:  do I prefer to aim a small laser beam with the Magic Remote at a small target 15-20 feet away or do I use a universal remote to aim, basically, at the broad side of a barn with a shotgun.  To me the answer is obviousSMART SHARE:  The term \"Smart Share\" is, in my opinion, a misnomer.  I can't fathom how anyone could assign such a name to this feature.  I think a more accurate name for it would be \"Dumb Share\".  There is nothing smart about its futile attempts to share files wirelessly between my TV and computer.  I have devoted many hours with LG Customer Service troubleshooting this feature.  I have received in-home service by a licensed technician on two occasions.  I have sent a snail mail to an LG business office, outlining the problems. I have even contacted Nero, the developer of the software program \"Nero Media Home Essentials\".  All attempts to correct the problems have been in vain. No one can fix them.  So what's wrong with Smart Share?Where do I begin?  First of all, it just doesn't accomplish its mission of transporting video, music and photo files as listed in my PC to the TV.  Sometimes it assigned arbitrary file names to my photos, defeating my ability to search for particular files.  Sometimes many thumbnails depicting the file contents were not visible.  Instead they are replaced by generic icons.  Often some of the files were missing altogether.  Occasionally it cannot find any files at all.I don't find the Smart Share procedures to be intuitive at all.  When I open My Apps I am presented with 4 icons that, I assume, might assist me in streaming my videos, music and photo files from my PC.  They are:  \"Smart Share\", \"Video\", \"Photos\" and \"Music\".  So if I want to stream, let's say, my Music files, do I select the icon Smart Share or Music?  Let me expedite this review here by stating that the Video, Photos and Music files do not relate to wireless streaming projects at all.  They refer to other inputs, such as USB ports on the set.  By selecting Music I am able to access music files I have on a thumb drive that is plugged into a USB port on the back of the set, but will not be able to stream such files from my PC.The correct path to take, I have learned, is to first select the Smart Share icon.  From there you are confronted with 4 pages:  \"Contents Type\", \"Newly Added\", \"Recently Viewed\" and \"Linked Device\".  Although there is a Nero Media Home Essentials icon present in the Linked Device page, you must resist the temptation to choose it and select the Music file in the Contents Type page.  If you do select it in the Linked Device page something \"loads\" for 2-3 minutes.  During this time all efforts to exit this page  are fruitless.  When it is finished you are directed to My Apps again. The other pages present their own peculiar problems, such as the my Photo files in the Contents Type page are randomly displayed and listed as \"File 0001\" (all 163 of them).  Although the photos are categorized in my PC by subject matter in separate folders with individual names, no such folders exist in this Nero screen, rendering a search for a specific subject or photo virtually impossible.  LG states, in a promotion:  \"Now it's easier than ever to see your big moments on the big screen.\"  I just don't find that to be the case.From the Music file in the \"Contents Type\" page you will be able to access your music files, with all its associated Nero problems.  You can also access your Video and Photo files in this manner.  You will find many problems in the Photo files here as well.  In the interest of brevity, I shall proceed here directly to the main problem, video files.When the video files are streamed they are listed by file icons.  The frustration begins when you select one of them to open.  Then you are confronted with the word \"loading\" and a small circle that is supposed to inform you that the process has begun.  But, in fact, I don't believe it has.  The circle is motionless for 2-3 minutes.  Then, suddenly, it rotates for a few seconds and the video opens.  I believe the actual loading is represented by this rotation and not by the previous motionless circle.  Understand I'm not talking about loading a 3-hour movie here; I'm just trying to open a 2-3 minute music video.The Smart Share feature is governed by a Nero software program.  In order for the Smart Share features to engage Nero must be evident on the PC Desktop and the server must be running.  I try to keep the Nero shortcut with the server running in the Notification area in the PC Taskbar.  I use the word \"try\" because the icon often disappears from there.  At other times it shuts off its server and requires a manual restart.  These actions appear to occur at random.OTHER:  I might add that response time for almost every action with the TV appears to be mediocre.  I cannot detect any positive effect the TruMotion the 240Z processor has on response time.Not all of these abnormalities listed here occur at all times.  Some have occurred only 1 time, while others occur every time.  I haven't time to list all of them in detail here.Some might wonder who am I to judge the performance of this TV am.  How am I to know if the responses I am receiving with this unit are standard for all such receivers? Here is my response to that:In my house I also have a 46\" LED of another make.  Although it is not a 3D unit, it does have a feature similar to the LG Smart Share program.  And it works flawlessly.  Download time for all music, photos and video files is instantaneous.  All my files are visible in thumbnails on the screen and none are missing.  The program symbol is always present and active in the Task Bar and never needs any attention.  The files retain the name I assigned to them.  The controls for this feature are more intuitive than with the LG.  This is an excellent example of how streaming should work. And, by the way, there is no Nero program associated with it.But why 1 star?Whenever I enter an electronics store and look at the flat panel TVs on display, it soon becomes apparent to me that they all present excellent pictures.  And why not?  This is not rocket science technology. I purchased this TV because of the many favorable reviews and the extra features, like Smart Share, that I had hoped would make this TV stand out from the rest.  I had intended to use Smart Share extensively to stream and view my videos on the TV from the comfort of my living room.  As it turned out, this feature is useless to me. It is my fervent hope that Nero will upgrade their software to repair the current deficiencies.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "broken screen", "Author": "rojitas \"george\"", "ReviewID": "R2BDLJ2G65DKTX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this screen and it is broken and the frame looked as if it was hit with a hammer.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Producto Excelente", "Author": "Amarinb", "ReviewID": "R3S0U7HA9MSIG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Producto Excelente, diseno super moderno, imagen nitida con la mejor definicion, super liviano y delgado, lo recomiendo 100%, las aplicacions de internet son bastante buenas y faciles de usar.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV - poor shipping", "Author": "Photographer \"Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R30W6HNE0VOWN5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV setwas all I hoped for but the shipping experience was less than satisfactory.First, the good news.  The TV has a neat look and is so easy to use.  It was virtually plug in and start watching.  The WiFi took a bit of fiddling - I had to go to the 'expert mode' but after that move, it started up ri8ght away.  I have a cable box so I use the cable remote for changing channels (the normal way) but use the LG 'wave it in the air' remote for the apps and conviguring the set.  So far the picture has been fine but I haven't really tried to optimize the picture.  First try at Netfiix and Youtube was a breeze.  Haven't tried 3D yet.Shipping was a big hassle.  My big mistake was calling in to get an Amazon CSR do the price match to TigerDirect.  I shopuld have placed the order, gotten a delivery time online and then called in for the price match.  Instead the CSR placed the order which meant that I couldn't get a reserved delivery slot.  The TV went via Pilot freight but I couldn't get a delivery date until it reached the final destination.  It showed up at the Ontario airport on a Friday but the local Pilot office didn't pick it up until the following Monday afternoon.  I was supposed to get a call at that time but I had to call them on Tuesday afternoon to get a Thursday delivery.  If I had ordered online I would have gotten a Monday slot.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed with Amazon on this purchase", "Author": "R.

After submitting the order I was informed the extra parts of the bundle would ship within 30 days but decided to live with it.  The TV arrived w/o any external packaging and when we powered it up it had severe display damage with two golf ball size black areas on it.  The shipping box was not damaged.  Then I went to exchange it and Amazon informed me it was 2-4 weeks to get a replacement TV -- although these are readily in stock at Amazon partner suppliers.

The price of the tv was very good and the delivery was on time. I had the delivery men bring the box in the room where I wanted the tv and they asked me if I wanted them to unbox it for me to examine, which I did. Prior to opening the box I examined the box. There were no dents or tears on the box, so far so good. As soon as they opened the box one of the delivery guys told me that the tv looks damaged. On the very top of the tv there appears to be a bulge, almost like it was put together wrong. In my mind only two things could have happened. Either it was put together wrong and should not have passed quality control at LG or I was given a tv that had been returned to Amazon by someone and was now being passed on to me. Either way I refused to accept the tv. The delivery men took the tv back, by the way they were very nice and helpful men, none of what happened today was their fault. I contacted Amazon to let them know that I was returning the tv. I was advised they would send me another tv. The estimated delivery is between 07/02/12 and 07/25/12, I can not believe it would take that long to begin to ship the tv, hopefully it will arrive more toward the former date than the latter date. When the tv arrives and hopefully in good condition I will up date my opinion of the tv.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,899.99", "Features": null, "Name": "LG Cinema Screen 55LM8600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz Dual Core LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses (2012 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317-LxkNjbL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006ZH0MGY"}}
