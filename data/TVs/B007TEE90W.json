I am not into gadgets, accessories, games, etc, just wanted a new really nice HD TV. This is perfect. it arrived on time, and it was super easy to set up. There is nothing tricky or iffy. Direct TV came out and set up the HD for me and WOW. I can count the blades of grass and even see the pores in human skin. the TV is also lightweight and easy to carry and move around, quite unlike the old \"portable\". Flat screen design is great; no wasted space, more flexibility for where to put it.

Very pleased with the picture quality.  Easy to set up and navigate through the menu options.  The default audio settings cause the speakers to sound tinny but are easily adjusted as described below.I dug into the audio capability because I planned to run the audio output into an external amplifier (or PC speakers).  Note that this TV has both an analog and a digital audio output jack.  I needed the analog output because my amplifier only takes analog inputs.  I avoided other HDTV's when they only had a digital audio output jack.The analog audio output sounds great.  If you choose to use the TV speakers you might want to modify the default audio settings through the Audio Menu options.  I'd recommend setting the SRS StudioSound HD to \"Standard\" vs. \"Surround\" and the SRS TruVolume to \"Off\".  Then go to the Equalizer Settings and adjust the 5 frequency bands to your liking.  I upped the bass range a little and turned down the treble.  Surround Sound from two small 5 Watt TV speakers isn't going to give you that thunderous theater experience so I opted to turn it off and use the Equalizer.For those that want to run the analog output to an external amplifier, this TV provides two options under the \"Advanced Audio\" menu selection.  The Analog Audio Output can be set to \"Fixed\" or \"Variable\".  Fixed sets the output levels to a constant value and the volume cannot be controlled through the TV remote but can be controlled from your amplifier remote.  Variable allows you to adjust the volume from the TV remote where the maximum output (100%) gives the volume set on the external amplifier.  The TV remote Mute function does not work in either of these modes.  It only works when the TV speakers are turned on.Only had the TV about a week but it's performing great.  I'll provide further updates if performance declines.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "GERALD BLAKE", "ReviewID": "R3E811SJT90JRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV is lightweight and has great color and sharpness.

First, let me explain the purpose of this TV.  My wife uses it to watch some of her favorite programs when she is on the treadmill in our basement, so there is no high speed action like some sporting events that appear blurred on a 60hz TV.  I would never consider a 60hz set for the main TV.  The description states that it receives in 720p.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it received in up to 1080i.  You can see this because when you turn it on, it momentarily displays the signal it is receiving (e.g. std 480p, HD 720p, etc.).  The picture was very sharp, and the colors were very vivid right out of the box.  No adjustments were needed.  I highly recommend this set with the caveat above about high speed action.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Rottlover \"... and booklover\"", "ReviewID": "R1LNRCFUFQOFJL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was surprised at the light weight of this TV. I was replacing a similar sized LCD TV that weighs about 3x as much. I bought a bluray player to go with this, and it has one HDMI input for the bluray. However, I haven't yet upgraded my satellite receiver in that room to HD, and I'm concerned that the single HDMI input will need to be shared. I guess I'll find out later. The 3-color AV cables from my current satellite box weren't too easy to figure out because there are red and white inputs on the back of the TV, but not a yellow one for the video. I realized after studying the set-up guide that the left-most blue input is marked Y/V, so I tried plugging yellow into that. It works. The diagram in the set-up guide actually shows the 3-color AV cable being plugged into an input marked Y, but it's floated off the picture of the TV's back, maybe to indicate that these inputs don't actually exist on this TV. It was confusing. In any event, the high-def looks good from the blu-ray. The satellite box, of course, is only feeding standard def, but the colors and so forth are still crisp and the picture looks good. I'm happy with it so far, though 2 HDMI inputs would've been better than 1.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Replaced junk with scratched up junk", "Author": "MOM A", "ReviewID": "R1E5MN67RIEVBO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Completely stopped working 6 months after purchase.

I had to pay for shipping it to them, and shipping time was about a week. Vizio turned it around quickly (a day or two) and it took another week to get back to me. The TV worked, but it came back without the remote control! I called Vizio and they sent a remote (but no batteries). Shipping this took another week. I want to pass on a couple of things I learned. This is not in the \"owners manual\", but you can operate menu items with the buttons on the TV (you must do this to set up the TV for operation). Using the buttons on the TV, Channel +/- corresponds to menu up/down. Volume +/- corresponds to menu right/left. Input corresponds to \"enter\". Also, if you are the type to \"look under the hood\" to see if the problem is obvious and/or easily corrected, don't tell Vizio. They may claim that you performed an unauthorized repair and void your warranty. Honesty is not the best policy here!I bought this TV for a smaller bedroom, and it is the perfect size for this. It could also be a good kitchen TV.  It is thin and light and energy efficient.  Picture and sound are fine.  Basic setup is easy. One limitation that holds it back is that there is only one HDMI input.  While this is pretty common at this price point, there are choices that have more.  There is also a choice of component video and composite video, but you can only have one or the other.  I am also using an RF modulator with some older \"legacy\" devices.  Initially, I was getting \"no signal\" until I discovered that you must specify (or search) for TV channels (in this case, analog channel 3 for the RF modulator) to receive them.

If this is important to you, take note.There is no Owner's Manual included (just a flimsy setup guide)...you have to download the manual and print it out yourself.  I find this kinda Cheezy.The 'method' in which you screw the base on to the bottom of the screen for initial assembly is very badly engineered.  I thought I would have to put the thing down and go out and buy a teeny magnetic screwdriver but after 25 minutes I finally got it screwed on.The whole affair is *very* lightweight, and the base is Not Large, so I feel like I could brush up against it accidently (at night; it's a bedroom tv) and knock it off the table.  A bigger base would make it more stable.Something is wrong with the sound on my set.  Sometimes (more than once an hour) it 'fades' perceptibly (not completely, but enough so you notice) for a couple-five seconds, then returns to volume.  This happens consistently on both DVDs and network television, so it's not the antenna OR the DVD ancillary but rather the set itself.The picture is GREAT, even working off of the cheapest of antenna.However, the size of the 'picture' varies unpredictably depending on what channel or what *show* on a channel or which DVD is playing. But probably this is an 'input thang' not a 'TV thang.'On the whole, it is ok for the price.

Fast forward two weeks later, my roommate figures out that you have to actually press the exit button to back out of the Photo Mode because otherwise the programming still thinks it is in that mode. The set has some sort of build in auto tuner for ambient lighting and the picture flickered so much that I had to turn this feature off. In fact I turned all of these features off and it still flickers (just not as bad). I contacted Vizio because I bought it directly from them and they would not help me via email. They said that I had to call customer service. Well yeah right. From the horror stories I have read online, no thanks. I have it to a point where its watchable and the flickering is only a minor annoyance but for a tv that's only three weeks old this is pretty much unacceptable.

To date, my review has not seen the light of day on Walmart.com's website, which occasions this re-posting.If one simply ignores comments concerning Walmart and its return policies, the take-home message is that the TV set I received was not worth keeping due to inferior picture quality. Since most online user reviews of this particular TV set seem to be overwhelmingly positive, I consider it worthwhile to express a minority opinion.* * *The Vizio E240AR TV was delivered to our door by Walmart at no cost to us. The good news ends there.Vizio E240AR proved to be difficult to set up; I had to perform a full channel search twice since the program missed the ONE channel (DirecTV) that supplies programming via cable. Picture quality is JUST AWFUL; after spending the balance of the day trying to adjust the picture quality, which included a lengthy discussion with one of Vizio's technical assistants, I simply gave up. Colors are washed out; furthermore, the picture quality varies from channel to channel, and each requires readjustment, a task for which I have neither patience nor interest.At the time I purchased the set I applied for a Walmart Discover credit card, so the invoice was paid on that card. Trouble is, at that time Walmart.com simply assigned a temporary card number and provided only the last 4 digits. I won't know my complete credit card number until I physically receive the card in the mail. This point was never brought to my attention when I placed the order, but it became vitally important when I attempted to return the TV to my local brick-and-mortar Walmart store. Without the COMPLETE credit card number Walmart will NOT issue a refund in any other form than store credit, thereby locking me into ca. $200 worth of future Walmart purchases! Thanks, but no thanks!I refused this gambit; the option I have chosen to exercise is to sit on the TV for a week or 10 days until the credit card arrives in the mail, at which point I'm outta  there. The bottom line: If you purchase an item from Walmart on their brand new credit card, you should be aware that the return process is not quite as simple as advertised.So, let's summarize the outcome of this transaction in terms of win/lose:(i) Walmart sold a substandard product and delivered it to my door via FedEx at their expense. They lose the cost of shipping. Furthermore, the manner in which they chose to exercise their return policy has cost them customer confidence (if that ever meant anything to them in the first place). If you've ever returned an item to amazon.com you'll most likely understand the source of my pique with Walmart and their self-serving policy.(ii) When the customer attempted to return the item to a local Walmart store, I was given a runaround that required phone calls to walmart.com with infinite hold periods and ultimate refusal to release credit card information by either telephone or e-mail. Customer loses time and patience and is stuck holding the defective product for another week or so, at which time the issue HOPEFULLY will be resolved to the customer's satisfaction.(UPDATE: This issue subsequently was resolved the day after I received the actual credit card in the mail, when I returned the TV set to a local brick-and-mortar Walmart store.)(iii) The TV manufacturer (Vizio) gets a negative review of their product; I can't really chalk this up in the \"win\" column for Mr. Vizio, either.So, on a \"win/lose\" basis, this experience has proved to be a \"lose\" transaction from the standpoint of the manufacturer, the retailer, and the customer.Will someone please tell me why all three parties would subject themselves to a scenario that NO ONE can win?
