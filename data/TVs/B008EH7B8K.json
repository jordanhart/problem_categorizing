I am happy that their call center is in the United States but the only thing they could do for us is to send a store rejected sale TV that will take 9-13 business days for it to arrive at the store then another undetermined amount of time before a tech can bring it to our house to set it up and take the old one away.I am sorry they could not send a new replacement to me and I would have been happy to have returned the old one to them, but that is not an option with this company.  It is sad that I have to upgrade to a new TV that would only last 91 days when my old set that was 25 years old worked perfectly, just not with the new technolgy of today.The call center agent was very professional and I had a pleasant experience on the phone with her, just was not satified with the replacement option given with this company. Maybe the others are the same, don't know, hope I don't have to find out.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy Happy Happy", "Author": "CindyLu", "ReviewID": "R3K5U765Q3X3J2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After many years of watching new TV's come out I decided to purchase one for myself. I waited till early December 2012 and while i did not buy the TV on amazon, I did buy it at Costco and have been very Happy with it. I did need to upgrade the chords on my Wii system however it only set me back $29.00. This Vizio has amazing colour, great sound, and very clear reception (of course it also depends on the channels/ quality of movie you are watching). Would recommend this TV, and with care hope to have mine for a very long time.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, Great Price", "Author": "Andrew Munk", "ReviewID": "R2NWLTNHBUYJ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only issue with some Vizio televisions is they don't mirror up well with DIRECTV remotes.  It will volume up and down but you have to power it off separately.Highly recommend overall....", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "so far so good.", "Author": "Adam Isdahl", "ReviewID": "R10COCG7B5IU8T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV itself is fine.  The sound quality is just average and the picture quality is nice.  I've had it for about 3 weeks now and I make sure to have it on for a good 5 hours a day just in case but no issues so far.I bought the TV used and when it arrived I was very nervous.  It came in the original box with the original packaging, I think it was all there but it was in horrible shape.  Luckily the TV itself was flawless.  The only real problem was it did not have all of the mounting screws for the base.  It had one that was right and 7 that were about an inch to long, I think they just threw them in the box as they were just laying at the bottom.I would rate the TV 3-4 stars, but I would rate the shape the box it arrived in maybe 1 star.  If I had to do it again I would buy this TV but I would probably go with a different seller.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Edge Lit Razor LED backlighting for brilliant color and contrast\nSRS Studio Sound HD\nTV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 38.74'' x 25'' x 8.78'', TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 38.74'' x 23.49'' x 2.4''\nAmbient Light Sensing technology\nMeets ENERGY STAR 5.3 guidelines", "Name": "VIZIO E420VSE 42-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED-Lit TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VjJzFTnOL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008EH7B8K"}}
