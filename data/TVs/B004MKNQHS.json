I bought this TV from Vann's, and it came with 2 pair of 3D glasses for free. Amazon use's Paul's TV as the primary seller and they are a very good company as well, so purchasing this TV through Amazon would have been my first choice, but Vann's had the better deal at the time.My TV arrived via Fed Ex freight on April 21, and I immediately un boxed it and put it in my bedroom. This TV is replacing an Vizio 37\" 1080P LCD which was working fine, but I really wanted a 3D set!Initial Physical Impression was WOW. Very Sleek looking, much thinner than my Vizio, nice sturdy swiveling base, and has an almost Dark Cherry Touch of Color to it, which I was unaware of prior to purchasing but looks great with my Cherry Bedroom set.Performance: I have the TV hooked up to a PS3 with the most current software (3D Capable), and Panasonic BDT-110 3D bluray player (Was a gift) and a Directv Hr-21 3D capable DVR Receiver. All I can say is WOW. The PQ is amazing, the blacks are Inky dark, there is no motion blur when watching sports and all this from a 720P, budget 3D TV! I have not any gaming on the unit yet, as I am nearing the end of the break in period, but I have been doing a TON of 3D Blu Ray and TV Watching. I must say that the new Bluetooth 3D Glasses from Samsung are great! This unit came with 2 free pair, and they retail right around $70.00 each. They sync with the TV quickly and I have yet to lose signal during a movie.3D Performance: I have now watched about 10 3D Blu Ray movies on the TV and have seen zero Crosstalk/Ghosting. The picture looks at great in 3D as it does on standard bluray but with the Added 3D effect. You can even convert 2D television programming to 3D, while this is cool, it is not as in depth as original 3D Material (Blu Ray 3D or Directv 3D).In conclusion, this is a great tv for any price. I am sure if you wanted to you could nit pick a few things (Mostly the adequate speakers) but overall I am very pleased, and I will be picking up a Samsung PN64D7000 to replace my current non 3D TV in the living room!", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just fantastic", "Author": "Huckleberry Finn \"baghdad\"", "ReviewID": "RF9OK7PDRIAK3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say - I am amazed and speechless !!This bad boy is huge - massive. I spent 3 days in my local Best Buy comparing the HIGH end LED TV's and LCDs to this Plasma. And somehow could not pass the price point. I also did a lot of research on Plasma's before I pulled the trigger. AVS forum is a good place. This TV is supposed to consume relatively low power compared to older Plasma with bills of only 28$ / year. It may be a tad more than LCD and LED's but I am not ready to pay 500$ just to save 10$ in electricity bills every year. The final decision was the 3D, a 51 inch 3D for 750$ - was a steal. Cannot beat that price.Pros -a. Beautiful Build, slim and elegant - much much better than any LCD I saw in store.b. Glass stand, and solid glass construction - feels awesome....c. Picture Quality - Outstandingd. Though only 720p - I could not make out the difference between Full HD and 720p unless I think I stand very close to it. Played Full HD Blu Ray Batman Dark Knight as a test, and was truly blown away. Rem - it may not be as awesome as an LED - I think Full HD LED's give a better picture - but this is largely sufficient for any person. Also remember the seating arrangement, unless you are seating within 5 feet of the TV, you will never make out the difference between Full HD and 720p. It is hard to believe but that is a fact.d. Inputs - 3 HDMI, USB, PC input etc. Connected to USB drives and pronto - nice menu to navigate and play your favse. Pretty decent Sound inbuiltf. Awesome clarity even from an angleCons -a. The only con I can think of is that the glass reflects a little bit, but that can be taken care of by adjusting the lighting in the room, if you are watching a movie etc. Reflection only present during day time. Play with the controls a little bit before you decide which setting works best for you.All I can say is - that Plasmas throw out an awesome picture / beautiful blacks great contrast and are better off than the LCD TVs. If you are looking to save a few hundred dollars, and still get a killer picture and a beautiful piece - this is the one.The Burn in issue is over rated, the new Plasma's do not seem to suffer from it. Atleast this one does not. I just played full screen content for about 2 days, and den got tired of it. Its been a week since I have it, and it is just awesome....Samsung has released a statement that their TV's do not require a break in. Its all your comfort level. If you are not comfortable, just avoid playing content that has static images for more than 30 mins. The TV also has burn-in protection modes.Apparently this model is better than 51D450 since it has a better panel.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture", "Author": "Schieller Desire", "ReviewID": "R24PZGPFFH8866", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recieved this TV on April 26 directly from Samsung as a Replacement to a four year old DLP 3D 50\" HLT series TV I had when it came out in 2007, all I had to do was caugh up $300  out of pocket, this TV is Great with both HiDef and Great with Standard def which cant be said of all HDTV's, I was comparing at J&R; it to the 2011 Panansonics and this year I believe the 2011 Samsungs Plasma's blows the Pannys in their class out of the water!! The colors and the blacks just pop! I have a 7.1 surround system but this TV has pretty decent built in speakers much better than my old TV, I have not tried the 3D yet since I do not have the 3D glasses not sure if I will even buy them in the future. its a beautiful looking TV in terms of the thick All Glass Stand and the 51\" slim Bezel at the J&R; store I can barely tell the diff between this 720p set and the more Expensive 1080p version.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "for the price, it can't be beat", "Author": "Frosty", "ReviewID": "R1N2VUG7U4VTD2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just received this tv a week ago to replace a faulty 2010 model (free under warranty) I absolutely love this TV as I did the original before it stopped working properly.  I was a little leery of it only being 720p but after a trip to Best Buy to see it side by side with similar sized full HD tv's I couldn't pass up the deal.  The resolution difference is negligible unless you're sitting with your nose pressed to the screen.  It does suffer from some temporary burn-in while playing video games but it's gone within a few minutes and hardly worth complaining about.  I've yet to try out 3D with this set, the glasses I bought for the 2010 model aren't compatible with this set as Samsung has switched from IR reception to Bluetooth for the 2011 model TV's.  Thankfully they are super nice and swapping out my old glasses for the new Bluetooth models at no charge.  The old glasses had some trouble staying in sync due to interference from other light sources and possibly light from the screen itself, b-tooth should eliminate that issue completely so I'm super excited to try it out in a few days.  I think the only semi-complaint I have is the lack of built in internet apps, though it's not really needed as game consoles and a large number of the blu-ray players out there have them built in.  As for technical support and repairs I couldn't ask for better than Samsung has given.If it wasn't for the lack of internet apps and not being able to use the 3d on this set *yet* I would have given a full 5 stars.  Oh, also...Glasses have some down in price by a good amount, when I bought the first TV Samsung's glasses were sitting around 100-120 dollars, now they can be had for $50 a pair for the battery type, making it much more affordable to get the whole family in on it.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Well worth your consideration!", "Author": "HWWoman \"HWWoman\"", "ReviewID": "RE8RFV2XR5F2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We just bought this HDTV at Walmart online on Thanksgiving Night for $599 plus sales tax with free shipping \"Site to Store\". At the time, Amazon vendors were selling this TV for a higher price.  Now Amazon has a lower price - $598 and no sales tax for many online customers.  We set up this TV today easily.  The default Standard Picture setting was very dark, but the colors literally pop when you select Dynamic.  You can see variation in the quality of the picture based on the broadcast or source, but that's to be expected.  Older movies are grainier.  TV broadcast picture quality will vary depending on the production.  We got our Blu Ray player with NetFlix up and running and one of the series offered on NetFlix set with \"Dynamic\" Picture and \"Fit to Screen\" is dazzlingly gloriously colorful - surreal but fun \"eye candy\".We also called Samsung with one technical question and in less than a minute, our question was answered by a live human being in the USA.This is a great TV for the price, but with the Samsung D550 1080p with 3D going for just $150 more right now on Amazon, if I had to do it over again, I might opt for the better picture quality of the 1080p plasma (though the D550 model with 1080p and 3D has less favorable reviews as does the D530 with no 3D capability - hope the D490 is a less problematic model). You can definitely see the pixels up close and older movies will definitely look grainier on the TV.If you are looking for a good deal, then look no further.  The current price of $598 for this 51 inch plasma with 3D capability is one of the best values out there.Make sure that you closely follow the Plug N Play settings step by step.  It is an easy process, but necessary.I will add more to this review once I have the Samsung D6500 3D Blu Ray player attached and check out the 3D settings.NetFlix is working so beautifully on our current LG Blu Ray player that I may keep the LG Blu Ray player attached as well and pick and choose the best player for the situation.  We'll see!  I have the LG Blu Ray player connected directly to the router (or is it the modem?) - hard wiring seems to work better for us.I hope that my non-technical review is helpful.  Happy Viewing!Update:  Well, the low price from Amazon has come and gone, but this TV is still a \"showstopper\" with incredibly vivid colors. So if you want your onscreen viewing world to be brighter and more vivid than real life, consider this plasma TV.  As stated, older shows (such as \"Two and Half Men\" reruns on Fox) will still look somewhat drab, but acceptable.  New programs (such as the Country Music Awards) will truly be eye-candy if you want them to be.  You can choose the intensity of the colors to your liking.  You have a choice of brightness including several settings(Standard/Dynamic/Movie) plus you can adjust to your taste.  In addition, you can adjust the sound based on what you are viewing, such as for music or to bring out the voices for those who have trouble hearing.  The sound quality is acceptable even when no additional speakers are attached.Update #2:  We have now tried out the 3D feature with the first Shrek movie and it works great!  The colors are \"to die for\" and the images are sharp and stunning.  We paired the TV with the Samsung BD D6500 3D Blu Ray player and the 3100 glasses (with side blinders).  All 3 products synched perfectly.What's nice is that you can switch from 3D to 2D with the touch of a button on the remote.  Of course, at one point our kitten must have activated the 3D setting while we were watching regular TV and we were wondering why the image was blurred.  I felt a little queasy after about 20 minutes of viewing in 3D, so I am sure that will have to build up a tolerance. Also it's probably not advisable to have the 3D images on the TV while some of the viewers don't have their glasses on.  It won't be enjoyable for them, that's for sure.\"Glee\" and \"New Girl\" look great on this plasma TV.  I am very impressed.Another really nice feature is the extra thin bezel surrounding the TV.  It also helps to make the images \"pop\".  This is a very attractive and fairly lightweight TV.  The TV does not protude much in the back and the rotating glass stand included with the TV is very minimalistic.  That said, you won't want any \"rough-housing\" around your TV.  Make sure that you install the base securely and that you set up the TV so that it is very stable.The menu offers lots of options for color, sound, brightness, etc.  Even black and white movies look great on this TV.  You will experience bold blacks and astoundingly gorgeous color.  We added horizontal blinds to several of our windows to block out glare when needed.  If plasma can offer so much color intensity, then it's well worth it to make accommodations for getting rid of the glare that is currently the primary argument against buying plasma.For those of you who looked at plasma TVs in the past, but were concerned about energy use, take a second look.  This TV is very energy efficient.  The energy usage for this TV is $28 per year based on a comparison of similar TVs (50 to 54 in) that range from $21 to $67 per year (at 11 cents per kwh, 5 hours per day).  As you can see this TV is on the low end for energy usage.December 21, 2011We are still loving this TV.  I watched George Balanchine's \"Nutcracker\" Live from Lincoln Center last night and it was spectacular - a virtual feast for the eyes and ears.  Several days ago we watched \"Tahiti: Ultimate Wave\" with the Samsung 3100 3D glasses (the TV synchs up easily with the 3D glasses with Bluetooth).  It was such an amazing experience to see schools of fish, sharks and barracudas - as if we were snorkeling in the coral reefs of Tahiti.  XFinity has a handful of free 3D movies offered at their On Demand channel.  The design of this TV with very narrow bezel all around only serves to enhance the viewing experience.It is also important to note on the technical side that this HDTV has 3 HDMI inputs.  I wouldn't consider buying an HDTV with less HDMI inputs.  Until we are up and running we have our LG Blu-ray player and our new Samsung D6500 Blu-ray player with 3D capability connected.  I haven't taken the time yet to set up the Samsung player for wifi or ethernet connection, so we are still viewing NetFlix by using the hard-wired LG player.Sorry if I have repeated myself a bit!

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"", "ReviewID": "R3OT3BKANNIWFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was originally planning on buying a 60 inch LG 1080p plasma tv, but after I saw this at Target, I really couldn't pass it up. For my apartment, I know I am not going to miss that extra 9 inches, and after seeing the picture quality (\"only\" 720p resolution), I'm sold. Plus it has 3D capability (not that I really have a use for it) and I saved almost $400.This is my first Samsung tv, and after a week I am seriously in love with this product. Setup out of the box was simple. I purchased the Walker Edison Regal 60-In. 4-in-1 TV Stand with Mount, and mounted on the stand it looks gorgeous. For anyone looking for a nice stand, this one is great, and it makes mounting your tv very easy.I had the tv out of the box, mounted and hooked up in maybe twenty minutes. After that it's pretty much just the fun stuff. I had my laptop hooked up to it and was watching The Mentalist as I adjusted the color settings, which look a little strange at first. Default settings seem to be set at some kind of energy saving mode, and I was worried that the brightness displayed when I first turned it on was as bright as it went. Not so, of course, there is a vast range of picture options available, and it only took maybe 10 minutes to get a setting I was happy with.Picture quality even watching The Mentalist (which is DVD quality) was amazing. The colors are really vibrant, and the contrast really is something you have to see. I had read countless reviews saying that plasma's are better for contrast, or for deeper blacks, but having been around primarily LCD's all my life, I really didn't know what I was missing. I am really looking forward to watching something of Blu Ray quality on it, I already know it will be incredible.The only real con, of course, is that being plasma, the screen surface is highly reflective. I got this tv to go in my new apartment, and while in my old bedroom I could see a reflection of the blinds behind me, it is even more noticeable with this tv if the picture on the tv is anything dark (less noticeable for lighter colors, obviously). It is a bearable distraction right now, as I'm still a bit punch-drunk over this tv, but I have also purchased the Redi Shade 1617201 Black Out Pleated Shade 36-by-72-Inch, 6-Pack to try to cut down all the light so I can have unimpeded daytime viewing as well. I have two large windows and a huge sliding glass door in my living room, so it will be a challenge, I'm sure. I will update once that is set up.For now though, I am extremely happy with my tv. If you have a Prime membership, I would recommend buying from Amazon since there is no tax and that will save you almost a hundred dollars. If anything changes I will update this review, but all things being equal, I think this tv will last me quite a long time.

This was my fourth Samsung HDTV in the last 5 years (Still have 3 of them) and I purchased it to replace a 40\" Samsung LCD that had been moved from the living room to a bedroom.  As expected, the TV build quality is outstanding, and the picture quality in both 720p and 1080i is incredible.  The only drawback (and the reason why I returned it) is that the TV is too reflective and has too much glare.  It becomes distracting and all you see is the glare instead of the picture.

This one is an easy one.  OUTSTANDING performance, price, features.  I have 3 other flat screens, all panasonic (which I have never had a problem with).  This samsung BLOWS the panasonics away.  My other units are 1080p and, in terms of general performance (other than using the monitor as a computer monitor), there is no appreciable difference.  the 3d effects are unreal, easy to set up.  the glasses comfortable and well designed for people who have to wear glasses (!!!!!).  The colors, brightness and clarity of the screen made it difficult at first to realize that I had NOT YET ENGAGED THE 3D.  Amazing.  I was looking for a budget TV to be used for guests, but this TV may very well become my main one.  I LOVE IT!and now for the bad part (*Smile*).  It takes close to 15 seconds to sync the glasses with the screen.  There is no easy way to tell that it's engaged except that the tv says \"Glasses connected\" and suddenly your image brightens.  If you take the TV out of 3d mode, the glasses disconnect and you have to manually reconnect them again (i presume to save battery life).  Buy some extra batteries just in case so you don't get caught short on movie night.  Have you noticed yet my ONLY complaints are about a feature (3D) that i'm not likely to use much?In short, budget doesn't have to mean cheap.

Clark", "ReviewID": "R1KGATHBTSQFND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this for a week, but I'm very pleased.  My other large TV is a 50\" Pioneer Kuro Elite Plasma, which was almost 5x the price.  I wasn't truly considering this 490d until I saw it in the store, where the picture looked \"cleaner\" and PQ was equal (to my aging eyes) to the 1080p's it was close to...and I didn't feel the need to needlessly spend money.  My goal was to replace and edge lit LED LCD that was 42\" in the family room I decided was too small, and gain internet video which I'll do via a blu ray.  This did that for half the price I was about to spend.  I received 2 free glasses and the 3d is pretty cool...not something I was looking for originally but definitely something we'll continue to use after watching 2 movies so far in 3d.  This looked just as good in 3d as the Panasonic 3d I saw in the Magnolia Display room.  Downside is glare (reflection on the panel) with windows during the day, but it's not a deal breaker for me, and not too severe in my situation - expect some of that with any plasma.  The upside of these reflective screens is a clear, clean picture.  I'm very happy for the price...or should I say I'd be unfortunate to have missed this if I bought something more expensive which I was about to do...just for a bunch of \"specifications\".I've noticed no degradation in PQ from the 1080p LED this replaced...I've not compared the 2 via blu ray which might reveal that, but I use this TV most of the time @ 1080i fios (down-scaled to 720p I guess now) input and the TV shows look just a great as before- but bigger which is waht I wanted.

While looking through the Samsung selection and found this one. I thought I was almost too good to be true, only $800 for 51' 3D tv. After reading user reviews and other reviews online I decided it was the right choice and ordered it, and i was not only not disappointed , I was still shocked I got all this tv for $800.  First off I went from a 42' to a 51', so the size imcrease was great right off the bat. Now for the actual picture, it only gets better. The colors are bright and vivid amd it does blacks very well. The color contrast is excellent and the colors really pop. As for the refresh rate, I cant see any pixelation or artifacts when fast motion happens in an action movie or sports game. I found this especially impressive since i was looking for some and couldn't find any.  Being a self admitted gadget dork I was very excited for the 3D, but had no idea what expect, especially being a \"entry level\" 3D tv. The first thing I watched on my tv was Despicable Me in 3D, and it was absolutely eye candy. The 3D effects were great and not at all gimmicky. Right off the bat I wasnin love. Since 3D television is a relatively new technology there are currently only 2 3D channels. There is however several movies available on HBO on demand which is very nice.

We sit about 8 ft away and it is not overwhelming...it's just right.The 3d feature is amazing.  Adds great depth and realism.  I was torn between active vs passive technology.  But when I was looking at the effect ultimately the picture quality of a acitve tv is far superior to the passive technology.  For some people it doesn't make a difference but to me it does...because the passive 3d technology cuts the quality in half so you are effectively watching a high def movie in std def picture quality.  The only other concern then is the cost of the 3d glasses being about 50 per vs about 25 per with active...but I searched for used (like new/open box) glasses online and found them for 25 each so was a no brainer at that point to get this tv.I was lucky to buy this tv during the promotion of getting 2 3d glasses with my purchase so I only needed to buy 2 more to have enough for the whole family.  I bought a blu ray player that had all the wifi connection and all the apps which was much cheaper than trying to find a tv that had that built in...and I would have needed to buy a 3d blu ray player anyway to watch 3d movies so this works out a much better way of doing it.Overall a great buy and for anyone looking for a great high def tv for an amazing price I dont know why you would not consider this.  Also the warranty here is much better than Best Buy...4 year plan was going to cost me $200...buying it here cost me only $100..that was the icing on the cake...go buy it already!!", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "What's All The Buzz About?", "Author": "Chase", "ReviewID": "R3B9GIFGVNSZDH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After countless hours of research and many visits to Bestbuy, Target, Walmart,etc; I decided to buy this television from Abt Electronics(lowest price). I wanted the best television for the buck(under $1000). It also had to be over 42\" and be 3d compatible.In the end it was the Samsung 51d490 vs LG Cinema 47LW6500. So I choose the d490 because it was about $400 less and a couple of inches bigger. The LG Cinema's advantage  was that it had a higher resolution(1080p) and  had passive 3d technology(For the people wondering about passive 3d. I have tried it many times and could only say good things about it).The tv took about 6 days to be delivered. When it arrived I connected the Playstation 3 first to try the 3d. I downloaded a free 3d video about a couple of kids playing in sand at a playground(btw very funny). In my opinion the 3d was not bad and fun to watch. One thing I did not like was that the 3050 series glasses that come with the tv were not covered on the sides. This made them highly reflective(I could see the person behind me sometimes). After watching the video of the kids playing, I decide to put in some games. Like Gran Turismo 5, Assassins Creed Revelations, COD Modern Warfare 3, Twisted Metal, and Black ops.Out of those games, Assassins Creed and Block Ops gave me the most WOW factor. Assassins Creed Revelations looked like it had an graphics upgrade while Black Ops was extremely 3d. I also felt 3d for Gran Turismo, Twisted Metal and COD MW3 was pretty good, but not great. It was distracting at times.After gaming I watched  HD channels on Antenna(I don't have cable). Again, It looked really good and I was pleased with  the image quality. Colors were great and seemed very accurate. I have all the latest viewing technologies at home; Lcd(HP), Dlp(Mitsubishi), Led(ViewSonic), and now  this plasma. I can honestly say Plasmas produce great colors.Next lets talk about Audio.The d490 has the best audio of any television I have heard(when set to movie mode). I was shocked when I put the volume up. For tv speakers they sound good.Now for the real bad news. This tv does indeed have a buzz sound coming from the rear. I can hear it till about 6-10 feet with sound off. It can be reduce by using energy save mode or setting cell light to 0.Update: I managed to reduce the buzz by a tremendous amount simple by blocking two of the rear vents with black electrical tape. If anybody plans on doing this DO NOT BLOCK ALL VENTS! most plasmas run hot. The noise is barely audible after the quick fix and the ps3 slim is now louder.TO SUM IT UP.THE GOOD:Colors(including black)speakerssmall bezelscreen sizepriceTHE OK:active 3d720p resolutionTHE BAD:buzz soundadditional info: Plasma screen is made out of glass and highly reflective. Bezel is glossy and attracts fingerprints.Settings:DynamicCell Light - 5 Contrast - 90 Brightness - 45 Sharpness - 30 Color - 49 Tint - G50/R50color-standard", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "cbrow35", "ReviewID": "R2HMBYOGIAATLL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good quality with Blu-Ray and HD cable.  Really enjoy it.Sometimes if you stand right up to the TV you can see artifacting in the black.  It's much more noticeable in the 3D mode than normal HD.The 3D looks pretty good.  I think the active shutter (this TV) looks better than the new passive technology (new Vizios, etc) right now, but the shutters can make your head hurt after a while.Overall, you're getting a very nice TV for very cheap.  I bought mine used and it came in great condition.  I haven't noticed many issues due to this being 720p vs 1080p.Oh, and as far as I can tell this TV is not 600hz.  The best I've seen it at is 60hz.And the free Amazon shipping can't be beat.  They scheduled a time that was convenient for me, set it up in my house and it was free.

The tv showed some fainted lines every time the camera panned, which became annoying after a while. I returned the tv and purchased this one and paid a bit more.Extremely happy I did.

I've tested a lot of video games(360 and PS3) with a lot of action, everything looks greats, the colors pop, the menu's are straight forward. Tested a few Blurays too, and they look amazing. 3d I haven't tested, not really interested either.All I can say is if you have the space get this tv, only drawback is the glare as other reviews point out. This wasn't a problem for me since I have a dark room.Note: There is one review about the resolution being obsolete or very strange, and not even 720p.

We looked for the best deal and amazon had it.  We do not have anything to say about the excellent service that Amazon provides but, Samsung is another story.  After the TV stopped working (basically turned off itself and never turned on again).  We called Samsung who scheduled us with a Technical service.  This group has the worst comments in the internet and we confirmed their lack of professionalism and courtesy when trying to schedule a day/time for it.  After several calls to Samsung, they schedule us with another group but later canceled it and schedule us with the first one.  To make this long story short, their customer service really sucks.  Once we got someone to check the TV (now after 3 weeks), they said that the whole power blew out and they have to order a new one before they can tell us what is wrong with this (another week).  It seems as the quality of this product is less than optimal.  I would not recommend anyone to buy it, not only for the TV itself but also for the terrible customer service we have received.  By the way, we have not use the TV more than 3 hours a day.UPDATE: After having the tech coming to our place 3 times total, we decided to submit a complaint with the Best Business Bureau.  After 2 days, Samsung called back very apologetic offering a new TV.  We requested our money back and after some hassle, they agree to pay us back.

I was wrong.  Our plasma has the clearest, crispest picture and the colors are vibrant.We were worried about burn in being a plasma and we have an xbox 360.  My kids and husband are always on the xbox and after a year we haven't had a single problem with burn in.  The only downfall I see is the heat that comes off it.

By no means is this the best option out there, but I might say it's the best at this price.First debate was accepting 720p over a 1080p model. Ultimately I decided 720 was fine, I sit about 10 ft away so odds are I wouldn't notice the difference, plus I just couldn't afford a 3d 1080p model.
