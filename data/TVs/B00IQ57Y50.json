I'm using an antennae mounted on a tower. So I do have HD reception. The picture is fair, but not great, like our Samsung TVs. Also, the tuner is slow to respond when changing stations. I've found this is a problem on some cheaper TVs. Also, you cannot \"look ahead\" to view future TV programs using the info button. You can view the current program title and info. I guess that's another Samsung feature I enjoyed. Another flaw is the color tint control is \"greyed out\" and not user adjustable. I've never encountered this before in a TV. So, I emailed Seiki customer service and recommend a programming/service update to correct this issue. No response on that idea. So, I called customer service. There's no correcting the non adjustable tint feature. The only color tint adjustment is to use the color temperature control. I decided to keep the TV because of the screen size, which I like in the living room. For the price, it is useable. Someday, this will be a recreation room TV, when the larger screen Samsung LED TVs are reduced in price.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IQ57Y50"}}
