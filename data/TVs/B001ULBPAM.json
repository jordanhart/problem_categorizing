Size: I don't need a TV bigger than 50\". I live in a Condo. This is for my living room. Watch distance is ~8 feet.2. Output: For <=50\" size, I can not distinguish if the output is in 720p or in 1080 p(or 1080i).Comcast telecasts HD in 1080i in my area. As per my research, it takes at the least 2-3 years for Cable providers to upgrade their output quality to >=1080 p as such upgrade requires huge investment.3.Plasma vs LCD vs rear projection: Partly this choice was governed by next criterion, price. Rear projections , available in the market, are largely >50\". Between Plasma and LCD- I could not find any annoying feature in either technology when I watch those sets in stores -Walmart, target, sears, frys and best buy. At times I found colors of Plasma-warm and more appealing than I found those on LCD.4.Price- I found Plasma sets did better on this criterion over LCD sets. Also most LCD sets produce 1080p. I do not need 1080p and I did not want to pay for that feature.5.Other hygiene factors: HDMI inputs(3), Component connection, Optical link for sound6. Factors I did not care: height(above 6000 feet) . I 've no reason to believe that I'll need to use this set at that elevation. Watching in light: I 'm okay to pull the blinders if too much sunlight affects experience . Burn in: latest Plasmas have advanced technology that constantly moves the picture and does not let burn in happen. Also if burn in does happen after few years, I am okay. I am sure I'll go for another TV in next 3+ years and can use this in any other room. 1080p-bluray: my TV downgrades the output signal to 720p. I wouldn't notice any difference anyways between 720p vs. 1080 p at <50\".7.Brand: Pioneer, Panasonic, Samsung are the leaders in plasma. Pioneer's TVs are way above my requirements- in terms of TV size and price.8.Personal Tests- At stores- without looking at specifications- tried to call out output and LCD vs Plasma. I was largely successful in identifying LCD vs Plasma but not quite successful in identifying 720p vs 1080p. On closer look 1080ps looked better than 720ps.( I just told myself that store guys apply settings in such a way that 1080ps look better..See I made the decision to buy 720p and was looking for evidence to support my decision! )I narrowed down choices to Panasonic P42X1 and SamsungPN42B450. Both appeared great- my wife likes Samsung's external finish over Panasonic. I like the fact that Samsung is $20 economical compared to Panasonic.I bought this item from Amazon , received it yesterday. Out of box settings are great. Played around with those options on remote control -with energy efficient options, Picture modes, sound modes. It's exciting.Will post updates to this review if find anything exciting or disturbing with this unit.**Update 6/21/2009- I could not find any significant evidence that Plasma increased my energy bill.-My energy bill for May 2008-June 2008 was USD 76, for Apr 2009-May 2009 was USD 82 , for May 2009-June 2009 it is USD 63.

After much deliberation and research online, we decided for the money we should be thrilled about the purchase, and so returned the Vizio to Costco (they took it, no questions asked, even without the box) and bought this Samsung plasma from Bestbuy for $100 less. The result... this is what we were looking for. We watch movies in the dark and this TV is perfect for it. No grain, crisp and beautiful. Is 1080p really that important? Or is this just more size-matters syndrome? Who knows - but this 720p plasma looks worlds better than the 1080p LCD, for less money.

For the price, I had absolutely not expected how great this TV is.  The picture quality is definitely amazing, and I still can't find a TV in any display stores with better HD quality so far.  Like all plasmas, it does show the true black perfectly and there's no motion blur what-so-ever in any of the video games or sports programming I've played so far.  It also has inputs galore (3 HDMIs, VGA/sound PC input, optical audio output) which makes it easy to hook up to all the different components.  I'm also able to cut down on extra cables by utilizing the optical sound output to my Denon receiver, so anything I view on the TV feeds digital sound to my AV system.If you're looking for a true hidden gem, this TV probably offers the greatest value out there right now - and the Plasma is still superior to LCD at the moment.", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV/price.", "Author": "cawesjmu", "ReviewID": "R3104UOBTQUWWJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV for the price.

After three years, I came to realize that a 32-inch size is not optimum for viewing from 8-10 feet away in our living room.  So I set off on researching a larger HDTV option.I determined that a 40-42 inch size would fit our space perfectly and be well-suited to our viewing distance.  Based on my good experience with the 32-inch LCD, I started looking at 40-inch LCDs only.  I researched every model within our budget ($700) and found several good units from Sony, Samsung, Toshiba, and LG. It was very difficult to pick a clear winner.And then, while trying to make the LCD decision, I wandered over and looked at the plasmas.In the bright environment of BB, the LCDs definitely have the edge when it comes to \"wow\" factor with their bright, crisp displays turned up to the max.  This is because people equate bright pictures with good pictures.  In comparison, the plasmas appear more subdued and are not as \"punchy\" especially when they're side-by-side with the LCDs.  But the plasmas develop a deep, rich image that can't be matched by similar-priced LCDs with conventional backlighting.  Go take a look at the plasma displays set up in the low-light environment of the Magnolia section of BB and the quality difference of plasma becomes apparent.The beauty of the plasma is that each pixel can be turned \"off\" and essentially emits no light -this allows for very deep blacks and higher-quality color reproduction.  Conventional LCDs have a constant backlight that bleeds through the LCD matrix and this makes it difficult for LCDs to reproduce dark blacks.  Plasma is also free of image lag when viewing fast moving scenes such as sports (something that even the best LCD's have a hard time resolving).  Plasma pretty much dominates the home theater world due to its excellent color fidelity, fluid images, and deep black reproduction.  If you can control the amount of ambient light in your viewing environment (e.g. no bright windows reflecting off the TV screen or strong overhead lighting) then plasma can't be beat.  From what I have researched and personally experienced, a lot of people struggle to find their perfect LCD display.  They never find it...until they finally try plasma and realize that's what they've been looking for all along!I narrowed down my research to two, similar, 42-inch plasma models:  the Panasonic P42X1 and the Samsung PN42B450.  With Panasonic's long-standing reputation for plasma technology, I decided to order the P42X1.  This is a well-built unit with a massive stand and solid construction.  After viewing some HD feeds (Discovery Channel, etc.) from Dish HD and performing some image adjustments recommended by online forums, I realized that the 42X1's lack of multiple user adjustments is a detriment to what could be excellent picture quality.  You get brightness, contrast, color, tint, and sharpness only.  After several days of experimentation, I could not get the perfect balance of color and fleshtones.  A more disturbing effect was that the 42X1 had trouble displaying very bright images and very dark images on the screen simultaneously.  It was a subtle effect but was very obvious when displaying the Dish Network program guide.  In the Dish program guide, there's an inset \"view\" of the tuned-in program superimposed over the dark blue/gray program guide that fills the entire screen.  When the images in the inset view would go to high brightness, the dark blue background of the program guide on the rest of the screen would shift or \"flicker\" in brightness, as well.  For some reason, the TV was being fooled by the high-brightness in one small area of the screen and would adjust the brightness in other portions of the image (this used to happen on old CRT TVs).  Unfortunately, this phenomenon also existed while watching normal HD programming -if one area of the image became bright then the darker areas would shift in brightness, as well.  A very unusual effect but noticeable while viewing different programs.  I also ran full-screen \"plasma break-in\" images of various color gradations and noticed that about a dozen or so red and blue pixels in the lower left area were somewhat brighter than the others.  Of course, this could only be seen up close.  There were also some small dirt/dust particles in a couple areas behind the outer glass.  I really wanted to like the 42X1 but had a hard time with several of the shortcomings mentioned above.So, for comparison, I ordered the Samsung PN42B450 plasma (similar in size and price to the Panasonic).  Once I got the unit set up at home, I set both the 42X1 and 42B450 side-by-side in our living room and did a comparison test, making tweaks to both units, as needed.  Both TV's looked good but the clear advantage was with the Samsung in overall color fidelity, contrast, and fine detail.  The wealth of picture controls on the Samsung menu makes it very easy to calibrate the black level, gamma, white balance, etc. -adjustments that cannot be made on the Panasonic user menu.  The Samsung could be easily adjusted to match the black level of the Panasonic, as well.  As a matter of fact, after running several calibration test patterns for contrast and brightness, I found that the Panasonic could not display the dark gray patterns on my test disc no matter how much I adjusted the brightness and contrast adjustments.  The Samsung had no such problem.Overall, I came to appreciate that Samsung allows the user so many different adjustments to suit individual taste.  In addition, careful inspection of the Samsung's plasma screen revealed no defective pixels.  The Samsung also had no problem with displaying bright images on dark backgrounds and suffered none of the resultant \"flickering\" problems that were easily seen on the Panasonic.  The only vices on the Samsung so far appears to be its somewhat wobbly stand (a minor drawback since the stand also allows the TV to rotate to suit the viewing position) and the fact that the plastic bezel surrounding the screen makes crackling noises as the TV warms up. (UPDATE 2/25/10: I exchanged my first 42B450 for a second unit and the second one makes absolutely no crackling noises whatsoever.  Based on my research, I believe that a brief production run of the Samsungs were built in late 2009/early 2010 with some \"noisy\" plastic bezels.  Most people do not appear to have this problem.)OVERALL PERFORMANCE - SAMSUNG VS PANASONIC:PICTURE:  Samsung wins this easily by virtue of its excellent color fidelity, contrast, and wealth of user adjustments.  Both the Samsung and Panasonic achieve good black levels.SOUND:  Both have adequate down-firing speakers that are ok for casual listening.MENU:  Samsung's menu system is extensive.  Panasonic's menu is very basic.FRONT CONTROLS:  Samsung has attractive, touch-sensitive controls on the front of the bezel where they are easy to see and access.  Panasonic's controls are located on the side behind the tv and can be difficult to see.REMOTE CONTROL:  Both are adequate but Samsung's is more stylish on the coffee table.INPUTS:  Both units have similar quantities of HDMI and Component inputs.  Samsung has a VGA connector input for PC; Panasonic has an S-Video input but no PC connection.  Panasonic has an SD Card reader for easy photo viewing.  The rear of the Samsung includes a built-in cable tie to bundle the wiring.STYLE AND APPEARANCE:  The Samsung has a more attractive bezel with dark red accents.  Panasonic's bezel is all black with a bright silver strip running along the bottom edge.  Overall, the Samsung unit is thinner than the Panasonic.BUILD QUALITY:  Both units have good construction and all-metal back panels.  The Panasonic's base is remarkably sturdy and feels adequate to prevent the unit from tipping over.  The Samsung's base rotates to allow different viewing angles but this results in a more wobbly base.  Some Samsungs built in late 2009/early 2010 may have \"noisy\" plastic bezels that crackle and pop as the unit warms up.  My first 42B450 had this problem and so I exchanged it for a second unit -the second one is perfect and makes no noises at all.QUALITY CONTROL:  The Panasonic unit I tested had a dozen or more red and blue pixels that were brighter than the rest.  This could only be seen up close to the screen.  There were also two locations where dirt/dust was trapped behind the front panel glass.  On the other hand, the Samsung unit had no pixel defects or trapped dirt/dust.  Both TVs are built and assembled in Mexico.Overall, I'm very happy with the performance and features of the Samsung PN42B450.  Every HD show looks fantastic and the Winter Olympics have never looked better.  I was originally set on the Panasonic P42X1 but quickly found several performance shortcomings (poor color, brightness fluctuations, and pixel defects in my sample) that made me return it and switch to the Samsung.  I own several Samsung products and they've consistently delivered high-style, excellent features, and good reliability.  As usual, Amazon's price was excellent and their delivery service was prompt --only three days from order to delivery at my house.The Samsung PN42B450 is an excellent value all-around.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Best Plasma This Size and Price Point", "Author": "A. Genco \"'Respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz...", "ReviewID": "R283V3GIXAK9DX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this Samsung PN42B450B on May 20, 2009. Today is Thursday May 28, 2009. As promised it arrived shipped from 6AVE in exactly one week. I helped the U.P.S. man carry it in yesterday at about 9:30 a.m. All the way from the warehouse in New Jersey, it was easy to track the shipment to our house in Orlando, Florida. One week is pretty good for FREE SHIPPING.  Our old television was a standard 32\" Toshiba which we purchased from Sam's Club in October of 1999 when we moved up here from Pinellas County. We shopped around quite a long time for that one too. It lasted up until now. The picture is just getting enough power to give an hour glass representation. Other than that, the Toshiba was fine. In fact, I looked around for a Toshiba to replace it. The closest I could come was a Toshiba 40\" at just around $740 almost everywhere. Honestly, it seemed like the price was price fixed!  We saw this Samsung in BJ's club and realized that it stood out from all the others. I had been looking for a plasma set, but did not want to get out of the Samsung, Pioneer and Panasonic corridor. These are the three manufacturers extant which build plasma. Why plasma?  Honestly, 1080p is a lot crisper; of this there is no question. The screen 'seems' brighter, and the longevity of screen is greater than some plasmas....BUT...There is no question that in the end, the plasma will give the best rendition of black. The colors are a lot warmer.  All other things being equal, after my wife got home last night, we lifted it on to the stand (while I screwed it in place and connected cables from my antenna and the Dish Network SD box), and then I sat back to see if it would start up right away or if we had a D.O.A.  It is beautiful. It worked like a charm right out of the box. I have not had to fiddle with the colors or brightness as it came out of the box. I am a sound person. I made some adjustments with the equalizer. We watched three hours of Law and Order HD on NBC using my Phillips indoor antenna (I have it situated in a corner ... everything comes in including the independents in HD). I could not discern the difference between an 720P or a 1080P picture. For our use it is more than ideal. I haven't tried it on sports as yet; other reviews think that the argument for 1080p is there. This television is more than adequate at the price.  Price is very important to me. If we could not get this set, my wife started querying me about a 50\" Samsung plasma which was coming up for sale at BJ's. After I quoted her the sale price of $850, it was right back to Amazon!  The set is excellent. I recommend highly that you purchase the extended warranty. Anything can happen to these sets. We are living in the lightning captal of the world. I have it running through a very expensive box for protection, but one can never tell. I never buy these warranties, and if you look at it closely, it covers the set from DAY ONE. You may think that this is ingenuous of them; on the other hand it also includes damage from SPIKES in the line which the REGULAR warranty does not. Get the warranty. It is already at $710. That brings it up close to $800. You pay for it now or you pay later. Read the reviews of the service calls regarding the warranty. They are MUCH better than average.  Over the years I have populated my home with MANY purchases from Amazon. Even when returning a D.O.A. DSL router/modem we received nothing but the highest level of service. My living room is replete with sound equipment purchased through and from Amazon. Their service is great.  Buy this Samsung 42\" Plasma and enjoy. The setup is simple. Turn it on and follow the screen instructions. You will NOT be disappointed.  Tony Genco", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Could not be happier", "Author": "Noah B.

My experience bares this out. Connect this TV to a HD source, adjust the levels under the \"Standard\" preset, and u won't be anything but amazed.I went with plasma over LCD because plasma TVs handle motion much better. LCD is hindered by a signicantly lower refresh rate that gives the most this weird 3D quality that i always thought was disturbing.For action movies, video games, and sports... plasma is the way to go.I also play GTA4 on this set, and it handle the motion beautifullly.If you are on the fence with HDTV, this is a great, great start.

I was looking for an LCD and just happened to stumble on this tv while shopping online.  I then checked it out at BB where it was on sale for $700, $100 more than the BB online price I found.  I informed the BB salesperson of the better BB online price and the store matched the BB online price.  So, by shopping online and then speaking up, I saved myself $100.  Wow!

I have owned several HDTV's both LCD and plasma. Panasonic, LG, Olevia, JVC, Sony and Samsung. LCD TV's have their advantages (no glare & less power consumption) however plasma TV rendering of colors & contrast simply outmatch any LCD I've seen. In my opinion, these are the most important factors in picture quality. All of my LCD's including the LG 120hz I owned had comic book colors and severe ghosting / image blurring. It was very annoying, so much so that I finally sold them all! Regarding the Panasonic S1 Series 1080p 42\" Plasma. Although the Panasonic had a good picture, this Samsung has an overall BETTER picture with more features. Yes, the Samsung is 720p (and thus should provide a less detailed picture) but even when viewing 1080p blu ray movies, its picture is superior. At a viewing distance of 10ft, my eyes simply cannot see any measurable loss in image detail when compared to the 1080p Panasonic. However, where this Samsung really excels is in its more fluid, clean images with more realistic but brilliant colors. NO background noise, NO problem with red & greens, (both of which the Panasonic suffers) a better ability to handle SD broadcast AND a brilliant & accurate HD picture. Also, unlike the Panasonic, this Samsung has a VGA input, analog audio output jacks and a far more intuitive program menu. More importantly the Samsung has a wider range of picture controls including gamma, white level, flesh level, film mode, 3 levels of dark or dynamic contrast and various other settings which cannot be adjusted on the Panasonic. There is much more that goes into a TV than numbers on a paper. Specs often tell very little about picture quality. Just look at the low end brands with their high specs and abysmal picture quality...you don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure this out! The panel and picture processing are vital to achieve quality images.  All I can say is that with proper set up, this Samsung's picture quality is stunning...and for less than $600 its a steal.", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "NO BETTER DEAL OUT THERE", "Author": "mhb650 \"Mark\"", "ReviewID": "R65DX4LNH7M6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After over a year of researching, I finally pulled the trigger and got this TV and I am extremely happy with it!The picture on this TV looks amazing.  Blacks are really black and not bright grey/black like you see on LCDs.  Since the TV is a 42 inch, there really is no reason to go with a 1080p.  1080p is not noticeable with TVs 50 inches or less.  Some people say they can notice the difference, but if you look at side by side comparisons (CNET did one) with 720p and 1080p on TVs this size the clarity difference is virtually non-existent.When I compared this side by side with similar sized LCDs, the difference was night and day.  Shadows look realistic and not washed out.  Blu-ray looks ultra crisp and the images pop out at you.  Also the advantage plasmas have with regard to viewing angle is a huge plus (meaning if you look at the TV from any angle other than straight on, plasmas still look great whereas LCDs become bright and almost unwatchable).The people at Best Buy told me plasmas would be susceptible to burn-in (permanent screen \"ghosting\").

Don't worry about it only being 720p ... anything sized between 0\"-42\" raster the 720p perfectly, and 46\"-63\" (or above) I would recommend 1080p. Black levels are amazing, even with the dedicated chip disabled (for the break in period). I want to address a few concerns most people have:Q. Do plasmas get hot?A. They do get warm, but compared to a similarly equipped LCD TV, you are talking maybe one degree warmer of ambient temperature. I will say, the larger the plasma, the warmer it will get (and the increase is not proportional so do your homework behind that particular model).Q. What about burn in?A. Most plasma models include a pixel shifting protocol that protects the television from burn-in so that's not a concern. All plasma's have the possibility of exhibiting image retention (IR), which is a temporary ingrained image that goes away (could take between 1 hr - 3 weeks). If you adjust your television to lower brightness, contrast and standard picture mode (off of dynamic) for the first 120 hrs (break-in period) you should be fine. It is usually the first 120 hrs that you need to be slightly careful. NOTE: I personally have had absolutely zero IR cases thus far.Hands down, this television is a great size, for a wonderful price and I would fully endorse getting it if it is one of your considerations.

We had the old TV out and the new one installed in half an hour tops and I'm no whiz with electronics believe me. When I sat down to watch my new Samsung 42\" Plasma TV my cat jumped in my lap as usual to join me in my recliner. I knew soon after this that I had made the right choice. There was a show on the history channel about Rome when I turned the TV on and in the scene just as the picture came up they showed a simulation of how the Roman armies would be on horseback creating dust clouds in the desert from a distance to make it look like there were lots more men in their army than there actually were. In the scene the camera eventually zoomed in closer where all the horses were running right toward me on the screen. My cat saw this of course and took one look at those horses coming at her and completely freaked and ran off thinking they were coming to get her! Now my cat has watched TV with me for years but its never done that! That cinched it for me on my choice. This picture was awesome, and it wasn't just me. My cat agrees! Poor baby! She's fine now though so no worries.My thoughts on the TV are as follows. I researched quite a bit before our purchase and even with my limited knowledge going in regarding the benefits of plasma vs LCD I had no trouble discerning which had the better picture quality when watching all the TVs in front of us at the store even if I did do this rather unconsciously at first. Most all the TVs we looked at seriously were in the 40\" to 46\" range. I really thought I'd get whatever I bought at Wal-Mart but Sears surprised us with better prices so I did get it local from them in the end. I looked here at Amazon and read many of the reviews but being one that has run into issues having to return big items through the mail I figured with a big purchase around the holidays it would be best to keep it local just in case.Honestly I did not know what I would get going out that day with the wife, LCD or Plasma. Which to go with was a question going back and forth in my head all day long. I wanted a 50 plus inch and figured I'd get LCD if I could talk the wife into a TV that big. The wife insisted no saying it was just too big for our space and limited me to smaller screen sizes so we compromised and I had her convinced for a 46\" we both liked. Problem is I kept drifting back to this 42\" Samsung in the corner over and over in the store to both our amazement because I wanted the biggest screen I could talk her into. I could not put my finger on why I kept going back to this TV when I had her talked into a bigger one. Dwelling on that I caught myself using it as the standard to compare and judge all the others by, albeit somewhat subconsciously at first. This alerted me to the fact that my eyes knew that this one was the TV to beat in the store. One by one I compared it saying, nope this ones not better, nope this ones not either and so on. Many times that day I found myself looking at other TVs back and forth in two stores thinking it was just my imagination or something when at times I swore I saw some blurred images on LCD screens and some grainy textures on others that were LCD screens. This one didn't have any problems like that though.In time it became obvious to me that this 42\" Samsung had better angle viewing by far than the others on display and it just quite simply had better colors and depth, and in the darker scenes it was noticeably better also looking more 'real life' to me. This TV also had a stand that really supported the TV without much wobble compared to the others there beside it and some of the LCD models seemed unstable to me. I could see our big Main Coon Cat knocking one of those over.In the end after a day of shopping and reading I finally had to admit I'm really not technical minded about these things, I'm not into blue ray or all the games. I just want a good big screen for fight night and no one broadcasts in 1080 anyway. Salesmen didn't help much just wanting to sell something by telling you what you want to hear. So, in the end I went with what my eyes told me was best in the store trusting that somewhere inside my brain I do still know what I like. It took me a little time looking but this TV has the best picture for the money even when compared to many TV's I saw at the stores that were many more dollars to get into. Tax and all I paid $678 for this TV. I could have beat that by a bit I'm sure but again, I wanted to stay in my town and not risk a repack and remail of something damaged in the mail this time of year. (Dec 18 09).Our Sony lasted 18 years. I doubt I'll get that kind of longevity out of this TV but if I can come close I'll be happy. One thing is for sure though.

I ruled out LCD because I never saw one that didn't look blocky during fast motion scenes. LED hasn't impressed me enough to make up for the huge difference in price. It's hard to believe that plasma TV's are the least expensive of the 3. When I started researching I was surprised to find 42\" was the smallest plasma size. 37-40\" would have been plenty for our bedroom, but getting a 42\" plasma for less than a 37\" LCD is a no brainer.I was originally leaning towards the Panasonic 42\" until I downloaded the manual and found out it didn't have an analog audio out jack. Neither does the LG. The Samsung 430 & 450 however do have L/R RCA audio out jacks on the rear panel. Not having audio out was a deal breaker for me since this TV is for our bedroom and my wife insists I use headphones at night so she can sleep while I watch TV. Having just spent about $60 on a wireless headphone set I had to have audio outs on the new TV. Most sets today only have a digital audio out and a converter costs about $50.Contrary to some online reviews and even the online manual, I've discovered \"my\" 450's audio output works even with the TV speakers set to ON. I can simply lower the volume and audio is always available through the rear RCA L/R output. Since my headphone has its own volume, I have zero issues. Even after I updated the firmware the feature still works. I could not get by without the external audio.So far I only have a few minor issues. The Anynet link between my Samsung Blu-ray player only worked for a few minutes now I have to use both remotes. I haven't figured out what I could have changed to disrupt the operation but even when it worked I was disappointed to find the TV remote doesn't have the \"Next Track\" function. There aren't a whole lot of things you need to change once your DVD player is setup but you need more than PLAY, STOP, FF, REV buttons. I have a lot of TV show DVDs that I like to skip past the opening and closing titles. Now I'm forced to use FF or grab the other remote. And speaking of remotes, the TV remote is unecessarily HUGE! The Samsung DVD remote is the exact same shape/layout but smaller. Again, it's only missing a couple important buttons to work the entire TV/DVD set but Samsung forces us to keep both remotes handy. There is NO way my wife is going to remember which is which. Add to that our FIOS remote won't operate the Blu-ray player at all, and it only works the TV power, volume and channel buttons. So we're stuck with 3 remotes.All that said, the picture is fantastic. It's \"smoother\" than the Panasonic with the default settings. You can crank up the detail and colors etc if you want but I actually turned the color down to about 45 and nudged the flesh tones up a little (they seemed a little too yellow to me out of the box). Other than the remote issues, I think this was a very good purchase. The store even threw in a simple wall mount for free which easily offset the tax amount. Do NOT spend a fortune on wall mounts, Amazon has some great low priced mounts. Luckily I didn't need anything special, no swivels and no tilting that a few washers couldn't fix.

I found a better deal at P.C Richard. It was going for $679. All together I paid $723. Not bad for a 42 inch Samsung Plasma TV. Originally It was a choice between this and Panasonic P42XI. I picked this one because although Panasonic makes the best plasma that particular model color accuracy was not on point. Its black level was great though. The Samsung 42B450 is a great plasma TV. Its color accuracy is on point and you can not even  tell that it is not a full HD(1080p) To be honest any size that is 42 in and below you don't really see the affect of 1080p. I like to watch action movie on this TV because it has no blur thanks to the 600hz. Anyone interested in getting a HDTV this a excellent value for the money. You will not find another great HDTV at this price. The only complaint I have about this set is glare. The glare is a distraction. But if you research the difference between Plasma and LCD you'll notice that Plasma always have problems with glare. Frankly the only thing LCD has over Plasma is glare and power consumption. When it comes to color, black level, blur and off angle viewing Plasma far more superior.

After checking up on the major electronics retailers websites regularly for several months, this television popped up on Amazon for a mere $540 including shipping. A relative steal! I assume this had something to do with HDTV sales for the Superbowl. Whatever the reason, we snapped one up quickly.We did quite a bit of research into 720p vs 1080p, 60/120/240mhz vs 600mhz refresh rates, lcd vs plasma. Having been into our local big box electronics store and comparing various brands and features side by side, I could tell the difference between 720 and 1080 resolution sets on any tv below 50\", so spending the extra $100-$200 for that added feature seemed extravagant. I could definitely perceive a difference in refresh rates, however, which ultimately became our first priority in terms of features. The plasmas' 600mhz refresh rate was flawless and there was never any perceivable lag.We have a PS3 console (with the wonderful blu-ray player) and a Wii to hook up to the set. One of our concerns with the plasma technology was the constant warnings of the risk of burn-in or ghosting which could come from a static image appearing on screen for any significant length of time. Video games as well as even the network logos of popular news stations are the most popular causes. However, sets manufactured after 2007 were built to address this issue and the PN42b450 has built in features to prevent this occurance as well as fix any ghosting that might appear if a person accidentally falls asleep and leaves a DVD menu or a paused game on screen for several hours. We've been careful to pay attention to not leaving anything on too long, but we've never encountered even the most minor evidence of ghosting.We couldn't resist the price, size or Samsung reputation. The set was very straightforward to set up. The picture is flawless and the colors are very deep and accurate.  For the first 100 hours or so, experts recommend 'breaking in' new plasma televisions by dimming down the brightness and contrast settings out of the box to the half level while the gas settles. We've taken this precaution just to be on the safe side and, even still, the colors are vibrant.Now for the (relatively minor) downsides: the screen, although coated with an anti-glare protector, is very reflective, which means you'll have to be careful where you position your set, relative to any windows or other light sources. We have a tiny 19\" lcd in the bedroom and this is less of an issue with it's more matte finish screen. Because of the set's glossy surface, as well, it is a magnet for dust. Another issue that might be up to the viewer's taste is that this set is best viewed in rooms with dim to no light in general. This makes the colors really pop, but in a bright room this might be harder to discern.All in all, at this price, you won't find a better deal. You can rely on Samsung's excellent quality and knowing that you've invested in a great product.

I don't know if that is because it is a plasma or just Samsung quality coming through. One of my best friends kept commenting that he could not understand why I bought a 42\" TV that was only 720p.

I determined that I first needed to get a plasma.  Why?  #1: I prefer quality over anything else (deeper blacks, more vivid coloring and detail, and more accurate motion display).  #2: A friend of mine has a $1800 LCD of which I get motion blur sickness when watching (everyone's eyes are less or more sensitive to motion capture technology).  #3: The lack of contrast/brightness compared to LCD doesn't affect me since I don't watch it while sitting outside in broad daylight or in an atrium full of windows.  #4: \"Burn-ins\" is a completely null argument.  LCDs get burn-ins just as much as plasmas do; I've seen it first hand.  And burn-in prevention (pixel shifting which isn't really noticable, among other things) helps prevent it.  Either way, if you're watching TV or playing a video game that has stationary menus or display frames for more than 4 hours, you need to get out more IMHO.I then determined that Pioneer had the leading quality, but was also discontinuing their plasma product lines and were extremely expensive.  Samsung and Panasonic were pretty much tied in second for quality, but Panasonic was pricier for roughly the same quality.After this I found that the media content displayed on a 42\" won't be as noticable in 1080p as opposed to 720p, and 42\" happens to be the right size for a mediocre budget and viewing distance.  Another note is HD channels from all content providers are actually only up to 720p now.  Blu-ray discs (1080p) are still expensive to purchase and higher layering technologies are coming, which will drive those costs down later on.Surprisingly though, while playing 1080p content from my computer connected via DVI-HDMI cabling, I can still see a difference compared to 720p content, even though the native resolution on this TV is only 1024x768.  As a side note, playing any content via a computer with a good graphics card yields much better quality compared to most DVD players, tuning boxes, or other converting devices since you first have options to change resolution and refresh rate at your finger tips, and second the hardware and software used to display the content is much more capable.Over-all, the only problem I had with the TV was the low native resolution.  For the price and quality, I couldn't really complain.

The price is right, the screen quality is good, the colors are phenomenal. I was worried about the connectivity, since I have two things that use composite video (Wii and a VCR), but this television can actually accept two composite inputs despite the specs that say otherwise (one of the component inputs can be configured for composite input). I also love the PC monitor input. This allowed me to hook up an older computer to the television and watch Hulu to my heart's content.The image adjustment capabilities (color, contrast, etc) are good. I just used the thx setup (available on most Pixar DVDs) to calibrate since I'm just interested in being the ballpark of correct image quality. I'll do this again when I have 200 or so hours on the TV.I've played plenty of hours of gaming and lots of hours of Hulu, both of which have some static content on the screen, and see no visible effects of burn-in.I only have two minor complaints. First, that the onscreen guide is poor. Several of the HDTVs and converter boxes I've worked with will keep track of current and future programming in a way that is easy to navigate. The \"channels\" function of this television will show you the stations' call letters and the current program, as well as future program (for what appears to be the next twelve hours), but it takes too many button presses to navigate. The second complaint is the remote - it's too big and poorly laid out. For instance, there are several colored buttons that have no useful everyday function, but common functions (like changing the input source from TV to DVD) require going through a menu, which is a pain. Plus, there does not seem to be even basic universal remote functionality, such as controlling a DVD player (my $200 TV from 7 years ago even had this). Ther are buttons on the remote which could work for as a universal remote, but they can only be used with other Samsung products. Bummer.

During that time, while I learned about resolutions, color contrast, HDMI cables, plasma and LCD, and the basics of HDTV specs, I thought that I wanted to get an LCD.  My price range was approximately 600-900 dollars, so I WAS mainly looking at 32-42 inch 1080p LCD TV's.  The rationality behind this decision was that I could get a semi cutting-edge TV that was capable of receiving a 1080p signal, the best resolution available now.  This seemed to make sense.However, I spent a lot of time watching LCD TV's in electronic stores and realized that, in my price range, plasma TVs all had higher color contrast ratios than comparable LCDs.  After having this TV for a couple of months I realized that for me, the sacrifice of not being able to accept a 1080p signal was well worth it after you factor in the brilliant and life-like appearance of plasma TV's.  It seems that plasmas have taken quite a cut in popularity.. there are probably a tenth the amount of models of plasma as compared to LCD.  Many are concerned about the burn-in, but I can say from my personal experience that if you are even somewhat conscientious about not leaving the same image on the screen for long periods of time this won't be an issue for me.Some videophiles will tell you that it's a big mistake to buy a TV that does not accept a 1080p signal.  However, The 720p resolution of this TV looks phenomenal on HD channels.  HD channels don't put out 1080p signals anyways, and this will be a very slow and complicated process.My two cents about resolution, plasma, and color contrast: you're much better buying this TV than a 1080p LCD with similar color contrast.

I didn't perform a break-in period of any kind and have had (lack of) burn-in from the horizontal & vertical bars for several months. I watch quite a lot of 4:3 SD programming. Was hoping it would even out by now, especially after performing the whitewash and watching more stretched out tv. Returning for replacement and will perform 100hr break-in on new unit. Other than this love the unit.I was saving the dvd \"Star Trek\" that I received for Xmas for when I upgraded from my Sony Wega CRT. The Samsung performed beautifully; nice contrast during the many explosions. I watched it mostly in Zoom 1 mode and really didn't notice any stretching and it almost filled the screen which was really nice. I don't know when you'd use Zoom 2 as everybody is elastic in that mode. I used the following settings that I found somebody posted during my exhaustive research period, claiming his TV was setup by a TV station engineer friend:CELL 10, CONTRAST 55, BRIGHTNESS 50, SHARPNESS 0, COLOR 40, TINT G50/R50After the movie it was on to Simpsons(tv) & Futurama(dvd)...wow, the colors just popped! I was happy to find extra channels now accessible (I'm using regular expanded basic cable); most major networks have an HD channel alongside with the SD channel. It's like night & day - compared to the HD the SD is for me to poop on! Others have mentioned how the SD picture takes a hit from CRT and it does a little, but it's not bad and certainly watchable. I think it's more when you switch from an HD to SD channel that the quality differences are so easily noticeable. This was one of my main concerns as I don't want to shell out more $ for digital cable. Of course I'm comparing a 27\" CRT with a 42\" Plasma, so it's not exactly apples to apples here.I was originally leaning towards the 50\" due to it having the USB and internet connections, but figured I'd wait and get those on a Blu-ray player and save me quite a bit of money since the 50\" was twice as much.Only CON that I can come up with is that the remote is oddly shaped; the back curves and makes it a little awkward to hold; somebody else described it well as \"bottom-heavy.\" Not sure who came up with that idea, must have been submitted as a joke by an employee. Certainly not a deal breaker. The button layout is fine.I've now had the tv a couple weeks and have watched a few dvd movies and plenty of cable and am 100% happy with the set. I am sitting 9-10 feet away and this TV is PLENTY big enough! The image is so crisp I can't imagine 1080p being much of a difference. The internal speakers are adequate at best; I use them for regular tv and my stereo for movies. The SRS surround really doesn't do anything surround-wise, just sounds different. The TV has now shed light on how inadequate my cheap 20-year old tower speakers are.

I previously had a Panasonic LCD 32\" that had some really annoying issues with sound and remote delays. I eventually took it back after about 3 weeks.I decided to do some more research on the subject and found this particular model to have the best ratings. I checked around and found Sears had the best local price. I've had this set for over a month now and I still can't get over how awesome a TV this is! Colors are very vibrant and detail is incredible in HD. First night I had it, I spent about an hour watching a PBS show on hummingbirds in 1080i. Amazing! Anything filmed in HD and broadcast in HD looks incredible on this set! I still can't get over the richness of the color compared to LCDs I've had in the past.I picked up the Samsung DVD-1080P9 1080p Upconverting DVD Player on the same day. Turning on the DVD player will switch the TV input to that HDMI connection and turning the DVD player off will switch it back. Nice. These work great together! Anynet seems to work well with other Anynet Samsung products. Watched Gamer on it the other week, and the detail was as close to Blue Ray as you can get. Hitting info on the TV shows I'm watching at 1080p with correct resolution for 1080p. (weird that)I've got an Xbox360 hooked up through HDMI cable as well and have that connection set to gamming on the TV. Xbox is perfect on this TV. I play lots of fast action games on the Xbox and didn't want any issues with motion blur, stutter, etc like you can get on many LCDs. No issues at all! I have the xbox set at 1080p and sure enough, hitting info on the TV shows I'm at 1080p there as well. I'm starting to wonder if this TV is really a 1080 sold as a 720 by Samsung.The remote for this TV is a bit big but works well and button layouts make sense. It's big. I've knocked it off my chair at least a couple of dozen times. It also has a bit of a curve to the bottom of it that makes it slide off surfaces if it's not fully on the surface. Fellow owners will know what I mean. Otherwise, I've had no issues with the remote.The Sound on this TV is really good compared to most. After a couple of days of use I read the manual and discovered there was a Simulated Surround Sound setting. I turned that on and am very happy with the sound output. I also have it set to the Voice setting. Works for me well with the volume no higher than 12-15 setting. Eventually I'll probably go with a true SRS system (Samsung), but for now I'm happy.I've seen several people complain about glare from windows and such, but I've got this near my glass French doors and have had no issues in this regard. No different from when I had a CRT TV most of my life, perhaps people have just forgotten. When it's off, it looks like a CRT screen (just flatter) and is somewhat gray rather than the flat black of an LCD. I kinda' dig it. The glass on the front doesn't appear to attract dust like CRTs did though. The glass makes it heavier than an LCD that uses plastic, but I think it looks nicer. I haven't noticed the TV getting hot even after running all day.Something others haven't mentioned is the 3d sync connector on the back.

The reasons I got this product are: the good reviews, the picture quality, the cost, and finally I've owned Samsung products before and all of mine seem to last.Did my homework before purchasing this television. The size of our room verses the resolution and television size indicated this was the perfect television for us. Recommend before you buy that you stop by Best Buy or some other store and try to get an idea of the picture quality in comparison to other Plasma and LCD models. Also pay attention to the size of your room before you get a huge television, your viewing distance can help you determine what size television to get. As for resolution - granted this television is only 720p but I had a next to impossible time of telling what was 720 vs 1080 at this size, in other words I didn't feel like I was losing any viewing quality by not spending the extra money on a similar sized 1080 tv.If you're still debating the choice between LCD and Plasma - my take on it was - for my eyes LCD gives the impression of being extra crisp in the image it produces, but at some point I usually end up feeling slightly nauseous watching action scenes on them. On Plasma I don't have the nausea problem and watching HD action content is flat out awesome. Add on top of that the cost of a Plasma television in comparison to a similar sized LCD and you'll really feel like you got a bargain.  Overall, LCD for me is great as a computer monitor, but not as a large television. One more thing, people mention lighting conditions with Plasma tvs - as long as you're not getting direct sunlight into your room, you'll probably be fine - our setup has a window a few feet to the side and a couple of French doors about 25 feet from the front of the tv and our viewing picture is still pretty bright and awesome.The features on this tv seem pretty standard. Menus are easy to follow, picture adjustment was easy, and the remote seemed pretty standard. Tested the HDMI hookup with a friends upscaling Samsung DVD player (wouldn't recommend this DVD player though, picture was awesome, but it was bit noisy for me) which worked fine for me through their Anynet setup - plus having a single out of the box remote that worked for everything was great.And finally, getting this television through Amazon was a breeze.

Upon delivery the CEVA guy came in setup the tv, checked all the cables, setup the remote, turned it on, flipped some channels, then I inspected the tv and signed off on it.

Which, while it worked, worked great, I had no complaints, the picture was great, it worked great, the sound was decent, however, after the other night in the middle of watching something (and now a 3 year old set) all the sudden it turned itself off. Then immediately started cycling on and off. I unplugged it and let it rest and plugged it back in, it still cycled itself on and off. I did some research, seems this was having one of several problems accounted for in the class action law suit. This set seems to have either bad capacitors, a bad mother board, or possibly both, there were millions of Samsung tv's with this problem. Unfortunatley, this model was not included in the law suit. I filed a report with Samsung, there response was a chearry automated response basically saying, \"We're sorry, your product is out of warranty, we'll be glad to forward your issue to an authorized tech for you to set up service at your expense.\" Well after doing the research, the bad capacitors would cost me roughly $200-$300 to repair, a bad mother board would cost another $200-$300. I had to ask myself if it was worth it? These tvs have come down in price I can get a better tv now for roughly the cost of the repairs, or a much better tv for a little over double. Should I have to buy another tv after 3 years? No, I bought this shorlty after it came out, and while I got what I felt was a great deal at the time, it still cost me more than 3 times the cost of repairs, I shouldn't have to pay for costly repairs, I shouldn't have to worry about replacing the tv at all.Then I started to think about all the Samsung products I have, because with all the hype, I believed, as most people do, you can't go wrong with Samsung, they are one of the best! But I have a 19\" LCD monitor that had to be replaced (thankfully under warranty) after 1 1/2 years, after it mysteriously had huge amounts of dying pixels that kept growing bigger and bigger. And now again I have an issue that the connection at the back of the monitor does not hold tight and I get really bad \"ghosting\" or streaks and have to push the connector up to briefly get rid of the symptom, I think I need to file another claim, and this monitor is also about 1 1/2 years old. I will say, while under warranty, their customer service is great, and they replaced the first monitor, with speed and efficiency, and I had no issues. That brings me to my cell phone...My cell phone is a Samsung as well... not even 2 years old, and the thing is trying to quit on me, delayed message receipt, the camera isn't working properly, just to bring up any of the menus takes forever to load, making a phone call should be a simple quick task, but it isn't, everything on this phone is now very slow and sluggish to perform, it freezes and locks up now, and half time rebooting doesn't work so I have to take the battery out to restart the thing...I think the only thing I haven't had problems with, YET, is my Samsung blue-ray player... but it is the same age as the tv... so who knows how that story is going to end. I am just really disappointed that a company that has such customer loyalty and is toted as being one of the best, seems to create throw away electronics that people have spent their hard earned money on. So as I am researching a new tv and a new phone, I am pretty certain Samsung has lost me as a loyal customer, because really the only way I could feel secure with them, is by buying an extended warranty on any of their products, and their products are pricey enough... because they are supposed to be one of the best. Incidentally, in my research, I am also researching reliability.. not just picture quality... and it is kind of funny to note Samsung and Panasonic are not coming up as the most reliable tvs, and while Panasonic are not noted to have severe problems like Samsung is reported to, they still ranked lower on the list, just not as low as Samsung and Mitsubishi... LG and Sony are top ranking in reliability though...", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not what I wanted but So happy I got it!!!!", "Author": "Shaun Boyer \"Shaun\"", "ReviewID": "RMC66QFDBS3YU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "when I first picked up this TV it was not anything I wanted.

Once in the Costco store they perused the TV section and after finding the 32\" we were after they set out to do the shopping and would come back at the end to pick it up. Once they had the cart full, they returned about 40 minutes later to get the LCD. My son wandered down the isle to the front of our 42\" Samsung. They had just put the clearance sticker on and as it was a floor model the price was $480.00, a mere 20 dollars more than the 32\" LCD. Needless to say a no-brainer. I never realized watching a movie at home could be so engaging as watching it through our PS3 blueray. I would recommend this set to any one, and the difference between the 720 and 1080 is a sales ploy. I don't doubt there are differences if your watching a 60inch screen.

Even in the store, some graininess was evident during fast action with all the LEDs. I did a lot of back and forth with the 42\" 720p plasma and a variety of other sets, looking for a drawback that justified the much lower price.

I was very pleased at first - but then something really strange happened.  The sound would occasionally start to sound \"funny\".  It would develop a bad echo or something that sounded like a \"robot\" talking.  As soon as I would change channels, the problem would go away.  For a while.  Then it would start again.I had a hard time finding information on this problem, but eventually learned it is a very common problem with several models of Samsung TVs, and is still appearing in brand new sets.  Samsung is aware of the problem, but they haven't even fixed it in their new products much less come up with a solution for those of us stuck with these things.This is a VERY ANNOYING PROBLEM.  The good news - there is 'sort of' a fix.  The bad news - it is a pain and the problem will re-appear.  This seems to occur whenever there is a loss of power to the TV.  The only solution is to do a full factory reset - which takes 15 minutes or so to complete, and then requires you to reprogram your favorite channels, hidden channels, picture settings, etc...Samsung has a long history with this problem - and of not fixing it.  I will now avoid any Samsung TVs, and recommend you do the same.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "500 bucks wasted", "Author": "javier d. fontanella", "ReviewID": "RP8LG8PIAECVX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "OK, the Samsung Plasma PN42B450B1D has a 2 years life span, plain and simple. I won't number the problems that I'm having with my TV but I deeply suggest you make a thorough search in the internet to check what I'm telling you before buy it. If possible buy another brand. In this digital times we're living is better to wait before buying, why? Well, companies like SAMSUNG LOVE TO INSTALL CRAPPY PARTS in their products and later they won't cover your losses and don't tell me to buy an extended insurance. We're talking about $500 for a well taken care of appliance that supposedly have a 20 years life span. On the other side if you try to repair it'll cost you almost the same you paid for. In this case is hard to apply the old saying that you get what you paid for.

I've owned two LCD HDTVs, an ancient but good viewing Syntax Olevia 27 inch, and a 46 inch Sharp which was burgled before I really got to enjoy it. On both the HDTV viewing experience was fabulous to my non-technical perspective, while standard def shows had bigger images and better colors, but no drop in quality.I was about to buy another LCD but was lured to this Samsung plasma by a great price and deal at Amazon... thinking if it gets lifted like the last one, my out of pocket loss is reduced. And I'm surprised by my disappointment. I'm 30 miles north of Albany, NY, a Direct TV subscriber, so lots of standard def channels and relatively few HD channels. The regular def shows, especially on a light background, have a fuzziness or halo effect around the edges of images, such as a person's face, that is really distracting. Switch it out for my venerable Olevia attached to the same HD Direct Tivo, and the problems go away.I was also concerned about the elaborate instructions in the (excellent) manual on how to avoid burn-in. Other reviewers say this is less a problem with newer plasmas, but why should I even have to worry about it? Also, the screen when it is turned off is not a dramatic dark black like my LCDs but rather a dull grey, like an old tube TV.I'm not so unhappy as to send it back, but certainly would not buy this same model again.

After two weeks, everything is perfect with DirecTV HD. The sound, the picture, everything.Everything, that is, except the lack of a headphone jack.Now, I knew it didn't come with a headphone jack when I bought it. But on the Samsung web site, it stated that I could use the audio out to connect to headphones.I use headphones for about 50-60% of my TV viewing. They are of utmost important to me because there are kids next door, and I can't turn up the volume after a certain hour. Plus, I have a loud fan going so it's more comfortable to listen with headphones rather than turn up the volume at full blast.When the TV arrived, I immediately tested the audio out to headphone connector I bought at Radio Shack. But I soon discovered that in order to listen to the headphones exclusively (without the speakers blasting) I had to turn off the TV volume.Unfortunately, turning off the TV volume disables the volume control and mute buttons on the remote.Thus the sound on the headphones, which is VERY, VERY LOW, can't be turned up or down.In response, I bought $22 external computer speakers to try to boost the volume. Unfortunately, that didn't work.Then I called Samsung, and they said there was no hope of boosting the volume. I was scared I just wasted $680 on a TV that I can't truly enjoy most of the time.I assumed listening to a TV with headphones would be a very basic component on a TV set, like it is for possibly every other device.I had all but given up hope and was going to return the TV, when I discovered the Boostaroo headphone amplifier on Amazkon, which costs about $22. So I bought it, and it actually works great. It boosts the volume. But unfortunately it requires AAAA batteries, which are expensive and hard to come by (unless you buy them en masse).So because Samsung didn't include a headphone I had to shell out the following:Audio out cable and headphone jack connector: $12 at Radio ShackExternal speaker: $22Boosteroo Headphone Amplifier $22 (it now lists at $42).50 AAAA batteries: $30I spent $86 to use this TV with headphones.Anyways, sorry for the drawn-out review, but nobody mentioned a headphone problem in other reviews.
