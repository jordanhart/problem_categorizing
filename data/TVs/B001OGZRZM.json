If I had posted this review a week ago, I would have written good things as well. However, it is currently 8 months after I got this TV, and it started having a burning smell yesterday. Then, while I was watching TV today the Screen went black, and nothing but a high pitched whine came from the speakers.After trying to find a fix for the problem online, I found that this model is notorious for this problem. It is extremely unreliable, and mine ended up lasting longer than most others have. The problem is costly to fix and will likely recur, so I strongly recommend finding a non-Sylvania brand TV to buy as this one is not only unusable after a short period of time, but a potential fire hazard from what I can tell from the smell it makes.", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible TV", "Author": "Carol", "ReviewID": "R293RZ7R3M01HE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HI!  I bought this TV (from Kmart) hoping to watch the Super Bowl on it.  I plugged it in Sat. night and about an hour later, got a huge headache from the burning smell coming from it.  I thought it was burning dust and what not off the lights and it would be better Sunday. Turned it on again, 1/2 way through the Super Bowl, my son and I both had huge headaches from the smell of it.  (I finished the Super Bowl on my analog TV).I decided to get online and see what was causing the burning smell.  What I found was astonishing.  This TV goes out within 5-12 months, you get horrible customer service from Sylvania and the TV is a discontinued model.I cannot get a headache every time I want to watch TV.  Yes, the picture is great and the sound, too, but it's not worth a cent when it will die soon.  I am not the only one smelling the burning smell, (except on these reviews).Please, if you want a lasting TV, don't buy a Sylvania brand.  Go to reviews and see all the complaints from other people.  People who have had the TV, for a month can't give a good review (unless it has a burning smell).  Read the ones who have had it for 5 months or more. If you have bought your TV recently, good luck with it.  I am returning mine tomorrow and will buy a Samsung or Sony, probably from Amazon.I hope this helps someone out on not getting stuck with a nasty TV.  Google search this TV, read the consumer reviews  and common complaints yourself.  The best one was the family who bought 3.  One went out within weeks, the other within 5 months and still waiting on the 3rd one to go out.", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Value For The Price", "Author": "Gerry W.

After a call to Cox and one to Sylvania, and not getting anywhere, i did the following. I programed the Cox Box to only power the the AC outlet on the back of the box to only get power, when the cable box is on. That took care of the on/off of the TV. Next had the Cox Box control the TV volume through it and that took care of the volume. Now i don't need the TV remote to operate the TV.

Funai (Sylvania) markets this TV for department stores targeting consumers looking for low cost deals. The off side to the price is little to no costumer support, poor quality manufacturing, and a one year warranty.The LC320 models in general are sub par in performance and engineering. 720p and 60hz is the lowest possible quality you can buy for a LCD, LED or a plasma. The LC320 models generally have a life of about 1 to 3 years before the board burns out. Funai (Sylvania) has a record for making cheap TV's and you get what you pay for. The best word of advice I can give is to spend a little more and save a lot more in the long run.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "I've had no issues", "Author": "Kelsey", "ReviewID": "R3DQ51OJY33AM2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've read some bad reviews on Sylvania TV's and I kinda feel lucky.

Any dark areas found in a light area (like eyebrows or nostrills on someones face) leave trails as the actor moves. The only way to fix this is to turn the brightness up so far that the picture looks pale and lifeless. The DVD feature is nice and works well, but without a quality image there isn't much to save this product.

We got it right before we moved into our new house and didn'y use it until we moved in. The DishNetwork man just set the dish remote to control the TV too so I haven't had any issues like the other reviewers have. No strange smells, either. Just a good TV! We got it for $300 at Target and couldn't be happier with it!", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "A nice set that won't work with Dish's old remote control - you have to upgrade to HD", "Author": "vfrickey", "ReviewID": "R3IESNGO7JYQFO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought my Sylvania LC320SLX expecting an average quality television.  It looked pretty good in the store, and the price was right.  Unfortunately, Sylvania for some reason didn't choose to make it compatible with many existing Dish (and from what I've seen on the Web, DirectTV) remote controls.  Now, admittedly, the Dish receiver we had when we bought the Sylvania was not really capable of taking full advantage of the LC320SLX's capabilities (no HDMI port, for example), so our picture quality on rabbit ears was higher than from the old Dish DVR/tuner box (standard analog NTSC video/audio).I expected to be able to control my new Sylvania LCD TV with the same remote that has controlled several other televisions, VCRs and DVD player/recorders with no trouble whatsoever. I was disappointed.  I went through every code in the Dish satellite receiver manual, in their web site, and I scanned all of the codes in the remote using the procedure in the Dish receiver manual.I called Dish technical support, who at least tried to work through the issue with me, to no avail.  Then they gave me a technical support number for Sylvania, which turned out to be not for the TV I just bought.  Calling the technical support number in the TV's service manual, I was told forthrightly that it was not Sylvania's problem that their TV won't work with a standard Dish remote control.  Wrong.  When you make and sell a TV set you're responsible for seeing that the remotes already on the market wiil operate it.Sylvania should - at the very least - warn prospective purchasers that the TV comes in that this television is not compatible with non-HD Dish or DirectTV remote control systems.  Most people don't spend $400 after taxes to get a TV that mostly works.A few days after buying the Sylvania LCD set, we went over to Dish HD (high-definition) service.  After we input the remote TV code 672 from the NEW HD satellite receiver manual, our NEW Dish remote DOES control our new Sylvania LC320SLX LCD television.  This still doesn't excuse Sylvania for marketing a television that won't work with many satellite TV receivers in the US market. Consumers should still be warned of this.Now that the problem with the Dish remote has been resolved, I can say that the television has a very clear picture; it has a very good selection of jacks which will allow the user to connect three HDMI accessories (say, a Dish or Direct TV satellite receiver, a late-model video game console and a DVD player/recorder, or a home computer) at once.In addition, there are connectors for S-Video, component-level and composite analog video, and several sets of analog audio (as well as a digital audio line).  There's also an audio-out line which, connected to our living room stereo amplifier, allows us to improvise a home theater very well.  But the audio \"in\" jacks associated with the secondary or tertiary HDMI ports wouldn't work when I tried to play dowmloaded movies back from my laptop (which has both HDMI and S-Video outputs on its backplane).  No amount of trying would get the audio output from my laptop (which worked fine through my home theater amplifier and my headphones) to play through the Sylvania's built-in speakers and audio amplifier.The ease of use of the remote controls for adjusting picture and sound quality are above average - there's even an on-screen \"equalizer\" to allow adjustment of the built-in audio amplifier and speaker system, and several pre-set groups of settings for picture quality you can select with a few keystrokes.  The screws which hold the chintzy stand on the television (you need to use it if you're not going to hang the Sylvania on your wall) are easy to lose, so if you see them, hang on to them.  We STILL haven't found the AAA batteries for the remote control.The Sylvania LC320SLX is a very well-laid out and executed system, and certainly worth the $379.95 (before taxes) I paid for it at our local Target store.  Don't buy any cables if you plan to upgrade your satellite or cable system to HD, because your service provider will probably have the needed cables and install them for you for free.And be sure NOT to spend $26-$30 for HDMI cables at the store where you buy your television until you've checked Amazon's affiliated stores.  They sold me two HDMI cables of the same quality or better for $3.58 combined.  Even with $5.96 shipping and handling, the total cost was just under $10 - well worth taking the time to shop amazon.com first.  These cables allow me to connect my laptop and DVD recorder/player to the Sylvania LC320SLX HDMI input ports.And don't buy the set unless you have access to lots of HD channels over the air (here in Denver we have around 30 over-the-air digital channels, about half of them HD, although a third of those are either televangelist or Spanish-language stations) or over your cable or satellite connections, because you won't be able to take advantage of all the digital goodness of the Sylvania LC320SLX.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not bad for $260", "Author": "Matthew Wiltz", "ReviewID": "R2CPT8DSN11XG2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this from a Radio Shack as the display model 2 years back.  It didn't have a box or anything but the tv worked fine.

It has; 3 hdmi ports, rgb composite, s-video component, coax, an audio out for adding a little more omph to your sound or wanting to use a gaming headset.  It works very well and I haven't had a single issue with mine since I've bought it.
