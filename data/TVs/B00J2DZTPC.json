Unless something is really right I just don't buy things that are acceptable. Much of this review is going to matter to the person who needs a really high performing TV and wants a great price. If you don't care for the details and logic of why I like this tv so much just scroll down to the details.A television is where you really should find exactly what you need if you spend plenty of time in front of it. Our DLP is either dead or temporarily down so we went to Fry's Electronics to see what our options might be \"just in case\". If you've been to Fry's you know they have one of the largest displays of televisions you can find.seeing how Panasonic pulled out of plasma and others might as well. Our window of purchasing a panel TV with the refresh rates we wanted was likely closing. LCD's are great but just don't keep up with plasma for sports and action getting worse with larger sizes.Price was a key feature. VERY key because it isn't a necessity. We could just get our old TV fixed.Our requirements: We watch a lot of sports. Football, Basketball, Soccer, Tennis, Golf and the list goes on. We also watch a lot of action movies. We play console games as well.  Needless to say many of our favorite things to use a tv for tend to expose problems with refresh rates. We were going to find a plasma because the larger LCD's even at 240hz show those artefacts around the ball when it's in motion. The gentleman who tried to help was trying to explain to us how LCD at 240hz is a different thing completely and just as good since the eye can't notice the difference, when I pointed out to him the problem isn't the eye but the TV's ability to refresh those pixels which ANYONE's eye can see. I quickly shut him down as we talked because... well if you watch lots of sports you know how annoying the ball in the air over a crowd with ghosting or pixel tracers is.blacks and brights: We quickly realized that many of the screens didn't have a deep enough black. This made them not look as sharp. Now it could have been settings but far too many were only ok at best. There were the 2500k dollar sets which weren't really what we wanted to spend so we stopped looking. We turned a corner and saw this set. None of the other LG's looked as good. I sadly, quickly stopped looking at the LG's until this one jumped out. The picture looked so much better than it's neighbors. The only ones we saw that looked as good were the nearly 3k dollar Samsungs. This TV didn't have a high enough price for what we were seeing. Figuring there was something wrong with it... something. This TV goes very bright. There is a lot of detail in the darks and it went far past dark grey like so many sets are limited to. It was contrasty and bright enough to look more like an LCD panel than a plasma.as I looked further into it I found out it indeed is a smart TV. you have a to purchase a $50 dongle to connect it wirelessly. It does have a LAN connector if it's close enough to your router.  There are 3 HDMI and a lot of onscreen features. This could not be right.Getting this TV home and quickly setting it up was simple. The onscreen setup was quick and easy although the remote part made very little sense. Either way it didn't matter because I use a Logitech harmony so it was going to be in a drawer soon enough. The picture settings of which there are six if I recall correctly. They are easily modified for your personal taste. We very quickly made the field less saturated and everything got clearer and more detailed fast.This could easily be the best television deal we've ever found. I wanted an expensive TV picture but could never bring myself to justify a ridiculously high price ever again. We did it once but in today's larger TV market selection there just had to be a worthwhile deal. We've had it one day and I definitely feel that we found an incredible deal that we wouldn't regret. In face we LOVE the way this display looks. As I write this I'm watching BPL and it's crystal clear with no pixilation. We watched part of Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull last night, as well as Iron Man.  The darks are dark, there is no pixilation with the action in Iron man and the BPL game.Colors: I'm a photographer so this section is very important to me. Colors are rich and easily go from natural to oversaturated depending on your taste. Some like those colors over the top! Sometimes I want it crazy bright and unnatural while other times I want it very realistic and low key. The settings allow for easy modification and switching between what type of movie or show you're watching customization. We've already setup a mode for darker movies like Harry Potter, natural looking colors for sports (as that grass and team colors can get oversaturated fast)and the list goes on.Build: The tv is black with a shiny plastic bezel. The base is a big plastic unimaginative functional base. No it's not the most attractive tv turned off. I rarely even notice the bezel or the base. I don't care about it's plastic finish since it's a tv and I'm looking at the screen not examining it's frame on a daily basis. It's a TV and the display is so stunning which is what a TV is.Smart TV functions: I have an Xbox one so I don't bother much with these parts. Looking quickly at it there is a lot of smart tv functionality in this set. You can watch Netflix, get apps, and all your other necessary doodads if it's what you need.Setup: fast and easy. We use a Logitech Harmony remote so I'll likely not use the remote much.Refresh rate: 600hz subfield .. ok this TV rocked the hard action and sports so easily that I am writing this review as quickly as I can for those of you who want a large screen for sports or gaming as well as movie viewing.Inputs: 3HDMI, 3usb, 1LAN, RGB component, Optical Audio, Antenna Cable inSmart TV: LAN internet in, wireless requires a $50 dongle if you're not near your router.Display: Most importantly this screen looks great for action and has crisp and clear definition. It looks like a far more expensive display. I compared it to many others in person and it held it's own beautifully with the sets three times the price and up. The only issue is that it is a very reflective screen. We luckily have it in a darker room setup for it. When you turn on lights you can clearly see the reflections and at some point we may purchase a matte screen filter but we tend to watch this in a darker room. If you have a well lit bright room with windows and a very reflective screen is an issue it may be a problem. It works well in our theater room setup. In every other way this screen is out of this world. Even purchasing a $200 matte filter would make this a steal. The only other displays I liked were in the $2500 and up range so... the math was easy to do.Pro's and cons are all up to you. Do you require wireless built in? It has lan and the dongle is only $50. It's a smart TV but we use an XBOX ONE as well so it's less important, but this tv seems to have everything you could need. I think there is plenty of information in my review to figure out if this is a TV worth looking at for your needs. I just have to say it's one of the few I'd consider worth anybody looking at. The only stopper for me would be a very bright room with lots of lights.. you'll either need a matte filter which you can find online or look at a different set. Everything else is most likely filled by the 60bp6600.If it would've come with a matte screen filter and had the Wi-Fi dongle included this would have been a major five star item. The Matte filter being more important and the Wi-Fi dongle is negligible due to having the LAN port. My router is upstairs so I'd have to get the dongle but with the Xbox it's a nonissue for me. The biggest problem I see for most people is the very shiny screen in a bright room. If you're like me and have a basement or room setup for theater/tv use it's not a problem. I rarely open the curtains in the TV room anyway. Besides those two minor things this, set is phenomenal.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00J2DZTPC"}}
