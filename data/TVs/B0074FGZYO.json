{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible TV", "Author": "partyparty", "ReviewID": "R641AZM0AHLH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't normally write reviews, but am doing so now, as this is a huge investment for anyone thinking of buying this TV and I would like to share my own observations.We have owned this TV for only a week, but after many hours getting acquainted, we are already quite familiar. If you are unpacking this item and mounting it on the wall - a couple of important points. Firstly, the danger with any large TV is that the screen may crack if it is allowed to flex. So, be very careful handling it. The TV comes in a huge carton, which lifts off vertically. There is another similar carton inside and this also lifts off, leaving the TV sitting on its stand, in the bottom of the carton. Removing the stand and attaching the replacement plastic cover could be tricky, but the solution is to have your partner lift one end of the TV and rest it on a pile of books 3 high and then to do the same to the other end. This way, when you remove the 5 screws, the stand drops away and you can easily lift the TV on to the wall mount, after attaching the cover that replaces the stand. After removing the heavy stand, the TV weighs a little under 100 lbs. Several reviewers have mentioned that other big TVs weigh more than double this. The first impression, after the TV is mounted is just how slim it is and the bezel is very thin too.So, about the TV itself. We looked at an Elite 70\" and a Sharp 80\". Both are excellent TVs. In the store, most TVs are set to \"vibrant\" or \"store\" mode, which gives an artifically bright, high contrast picture. We asked for the TVs to be set on normal and natural settings, so we could see the detail clearly. Stores also vary in the quality of their input signal. In the end, it seemed very clear to us that the highly-priced Samsung 75\" was the best.When my wife and I set up the new TV at home, the picture was already great, despite several reviews that say you need to get help calibrating it. After experimenting, we set the TV to the standard setting and also slightly reduced the contrast to around 85. The picture is unbelievably good. We have U-verse and I noticed that, despite the extremely good picture, sometimes close facial detail would be missing, unlike on our 47\" Samsung, where you can see every pore. After a little research and talking to AT&T;, I realised that the reason is that U-verse and other cable providers are pumping out 1080i - NOT 1080p. On a smaller TV, like our 47\", you can not see this, but when the screen is 75\", you lose a tiny bit of detail - although, as I said, the picture is still fantastic. Off the record, a couple of the U-verse people told me that both 1080p and 3D are coming. Someone mentioned that only Directv is currently transmitting 1080p.Here's the thing, we have a TV with maybe the best quailty picture we have ever seen, but we know that it will get even better, so I next rented a blue ray movie and the picture is now truly staggering. On closeups, every hair is shown in fine detail. This is an incredible TV! The instruction book isn't that hot. Bit thin on info. The 4 supplied 3D glasses are excellent. We have only tried the built-in demo 3D movie extrects, but it is really very very good. Not sure I will use this feature much. The TV comes with 2 remotes - a standard one and another that has components like a laptop touchpad. The TV also responds to hand signals and the spoken word, but frankly, we prefer to press normal buttons. The wireless features are good and connect easily to YouTube, Halo etc. The ambiant room auto-dimming works very well, unlike our 47\" that tends to make the screen too dark in low light conditions.If you can afford this mightly TV, it is, in my opinion, the best out there, by a mile. Don't fall for the $999 extended warranty. The store makes 50% profit on that and if the unit doesn't fail during the normal warranty period, it should go on for many years. I registered the TV online and Sumsung gives you 15 months, instead of 12, for doing so.One last piece of advice for anyone who has bothered to read all this. Our wall mount has quick release tabs that hang down at the back. Because the TV is so large, you can't reach these tabs and need to spend 20 mins with a bent coat hanger trying to reach them. Tie string to each of them.Oh yes, one other thing, several reviewers suggested turning of the auto motion plus feature. This is a personal choice. I turned it off and was watching some British motor racing. Cars shooting across the screen. I could see a little jerking. I turned the auto motion feature back on and not only was the fast movement corrected, but the picture also seemed to look better.Hope this helps!", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, must fit for your circumstances and desires", "Author": "R. Harlow \"FredH\"", "ReviewID": "R1AM4GHGF6FOXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, lets be honest, this is an expensive tv.  So the question of is it worth it will be a matter of priorities for you.  Picture quality is amazing, I think better than Panasonic, pioneer elite, etc.  but my specific set of circumstances found this as the only current tv that fit the bill.  I wanted a TV for a home theater (I do not like projectors, I don't care what they say, no one I have seen can rival that of a good tv and there are too many limitations).  The TV needed to have a great picture, be at least 75\", be easily wall mountable, be thin, relatively low weight, and esthetically pleasing.  There is no other tv out there that has all of these requirements.  Even though it seems minimal, 10 inches makes a huge difference in a home theater so the 65\" would not work for me.  The sharp 80 \" pictures quality just doesn't compare and it's twice the weight and 3 times as thick.  You can spend almost as much for a 70\" elite, but you get 5 less inches, a thicker and heavier tv, and IMHO , picture not as good.  So that leaves this tv.  Is it worth 9k?  To me it is, I am blessed to be able to afford it.  And it fulfilled all of my requirements.  Trust me, I thought long and hard about this TV, but in the end I would rather spend a few thousand more than invest in something that was heavy, thick and not great looking.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best TV picture on a screen bigger than 70\"- a comparison", "Author": "Chris \"Just a movie fan\"", "ReviewID": "R1RGAZBL8R9OLG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, the Samsung is very expensive, but the picture quality is just hands down gorgeous- the best I've ever seen on a screen bigger than 70\" by far. It looks to be very, very close the Sharp Elite 70\", which is the highest rated big screen TV on the market today.  I took my \"Thor\" 3D blu-ray with me (it has a lot of dark scenes that torture 3D TV presentation) and \"The Dark Knight\" (a lot of high-contrast scenes) to run the floor models through their paces and here's what I came up with...  The Samsung's contrast and black level detail was far superior to anyone else with bright color and outstanding picture quality. 3D was a revelation- I have never seen a TV able to present such resolution and detail in 3D mode on a super-large screen before. The \"micro-dimming\" works spectacularly in producing a vivid, high-contrast picture that outshines everything else in it's size. The more I analyzed and compared, the more the Samsung UN75ES9000 stood out from the rest. I could only find one fault (well, besides that scary price!)- a momentary, slight pixilation occurring occasionally in some parts of a few moving images- which could be a result of having some motion enhancement turned off or on within the set ( I didn't have the staff at the stores do anything else other than turn off the mode on the TV's that cause the \"soap-opera effect\"- a plague on all 120/240 Hz LED's that luckily can be shut off). But if you want the best picture that money can buy right now for under $10K, this amazing 75\" TV fulfills all those wishes.  In comparison, the Sharp Aquos 80\" LED is a nice entry- the picture is clean, with good blacks, nice color and decent contrast- not as brilliant and defined as the Samsung, but still a solid set. I did find the Sharp to have some ghosting occasionally when viewing in 3D, not terrible, but still noticeable when it appears. The clarity in those tough, dark scenes was slightly muted, especially after seeing the Samsung, but it's still pretty decent. When you add in Sharp reliability, a 5\" larger screen and a price at almost half the Samsung it then becomes a tough decision to make.  A cheaper, but good option for those on a budget are the Mitsubishi DLP sets. I've owned several and never had a problem with any. If your main watch mode is broadcast TV and \"normal\" movies you probably can't go wrong. DLP's suffer a bit with blooming in dark scenes and the darkest scenes in 3D viewing can become almost totally washed out, but for everyday watching they're quite satisfactory and less than half the price of a comparably sized LED set.  Well, that's just my opinion based on several days spent at two stores, going back and forth having salespeople play my movies between one set and another and watching from 12-15 feet away (except I got right up to 5 feet from the Samsung and it still looked spectacular!)- do your own research! I'm still on the fence for the moment- reliability issues mentioned here and there on the internet with past Samsung TV's that make me hesitant to pull the trigger for $9K, when I can get a solid upgrade from my old Mitsubishi to a darn nice 80\" Sharp for almost half that. To be sure, those fears may be somewhat unfounded, because the latest Consumer Reports rates the two the same in reliability- and that's based on reports from thousands of consumers, not just the small sampling that post online.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware! Picture quality does not match outrageous pricing", "Author": "Matthew Fritz", "ReviewID": "R2AFDL4UT2ESN4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I purchased this tv and received it over a week ago. Had plenty of time to mess with the ES9000 and after debating with my wife and with myself, I'm having the tv picked up tomorrow and returned for a refund. I'm not doing this because I think the picture is by any means bad, I just can't sleep at night knowing I paid $9,000 for a tv that I can basically get the same in 65\" for $3,499.. I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, I'm just more or less sending a warning if you're expecting anything much better than the Samsung ES8000. This tv is nowhere near worth the asking price.Im not going to start a Samsung bashing or go on a angry tirade. My main issue with this tv is that it's basically the ES8000 with two features from the D8000 added back in. Doesn't make sense at all and I believe that calling this tv a 9000 series as opposed to an 8000 is a marketing scam. This tv had no superior processing other than bringing Cinema Black and Smart LED back into the menu. Again, two features that were found in last years D8000. I see no difference in picture quality from either tv other than increased brightness and slightly increased black levels due to Cinema Black turning off the LEDs behind the letterbox bars.I guess it's my fault for buying into all the hype and not viewing it in person first. I just can't justify this price. However, the black levels are very good, and I've yet to see any flashlighting, clouding or banding that I saw on both the D8000 and ES8000. At least I can say the quality control on this tv seems much better than the other Models. I just think its crazy that there's no superior picture options or improvements. Motion handling is the same and just as bad as the other samsungs, same with lag input. I don't understand how they can call this a superior tv than the ES8000 by bringing back two features from last years model that they intentionally left out of the ES8000. Also, I'm not sure if its due to increased brightness or size but the 3D has much more crosstalk than the ES8000.

The usual TV box was put in a much lager brown box and packed very carefully and with a lot of protection. Not a scratch anywhere inside.Next, setting up was quick and easy. After connecting to the net, the TV took about half an hour to update everything, and I had to access most of teh features in Smart Hub one at a time to update everything, but that's okay. It is not much different than first time turning on a laptop or Smart phone.Then, it paired without any complaints with both my HTC one and my wife's S4 without any complaint. In fact, my friend brought over an iPhone just to see if Apple plays well with Samsung here, and it did! All you have to do is to search for \"Samsung smart\" in any app store for all the great free apps.Finally, cough up a few bucks for a  few extra apps, and your world will become perfect.BTW, although getting a wireless keyboard may seem like a good idea, since the on screen keyboard is annoying, you shouldn't bother about that if you have a smart phone.=====Verdict:Best smart TV and Best value.

I put it in place of our Sony Bravia 65\" which we've had for several years.  I wanted to see how long it would take her to notice the difference if I didn't say anything.  For the \"Taste Test\" I put on a 1979 episode of Fantasy Island on DVD.  The aspect ration is 4:3, so the size change was less apparent.  What this TV can do with lower quality video is simply amazing!  I've never in my life used words like \"eye popping\" and \"stunning\" to describe anything, but those words are truly appropriate for this TV.As I predicted, my wife didn't notice the size of the new TV right away, but she immediately asked me what I did to make the picture look so good!The moral of this story is:1. Size does matter2. Bigger is better3. You get what you pay forDon't believe me? Go to your local store and see for yourself.On the technical side:1. The TV can convert regular 2D video to 3D.  3D encoded discs are still better, but what the TV can do is very surprising.2. One button on the remote can toggle immediately between 2D & 3D regardless of disc type.3. Be sure to turn off Auto Motion Plus, which is found under \"Picture Options\".  The Auto Motion Plus makes the video look like a live stage play rather than a movie - very disconcerting.  I would have returned the TV if this feature could not be turned off.3. The four pair of active 3D glasses that come with the set are rechargeable, I much prefer regular batteries.  You can buy standard battery powered glasses for $20.Samsung SSG-4100GB 3D Active Glasses 2012 Models - BlackI'm not really a big fan of 3D, but I wasn't going to buy a new TV without it.

When we first got the TV, the picture made everything look like a bad soap opera - from regular HD TV programming to FIOS movies to Blu Ray DVDs.  I contacted Samsung and they had me turn off some random feature and that help to some degree but them the TV started to get the jitters (probably because it knew I was getting ready to go all Office Space on it).The jitters consisted of random periods between 5 and 30 seconds where the entire picture would suddenly become, well, jittery - like multiple frames were being missed.  Samsung told me that I had to turn that annoying Soap Opera Feature back on to remove the jitters.  They even tried to blame the jitters on the FIOS receiver even though that receiver has worked flawlessly with large HD TVs both before and after this one.I ended up returning this hunk of junk (which was a JOY to re-package) and I was so turned off by my experience with this LCD (Large CR***Y Device) that I actually downsized to an awesome 65\" Plasma found here - http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-VIERA-TC-P65VT50-65-Inch-Plasma/dp/B00752VLSG/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1350609876&sr;=1-1&keywords;=65+plasma+tc-p65vt50Please Google this TV before buying and read similar horror stories - this TV is NOT worth the money - I would not take it if they gave it to me for free!!!", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not as large as the current Sharp 80\" LED TV but thinner", "Author": "EMANUELE DE STEFANO", "ReviewID": "R34X4H1H2C8BW5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The race to who can make the largest consumer LED TV is on.In addition to their 80\" LED TV Sharp has announced their Largest TV yet, the Aquos 90\"LEDThe television, named the Sharp Aquos LC-90LE745U, is as long as NBA star Lebron James is tall LOL.Now this is where my mind starts wondering...I have no doubt that companies like Sharp, Sony, LG or Samsung can make larger screens in the future.
