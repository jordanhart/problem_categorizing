Was cheapest price for 1080p, good size for up close gaming, and fit perfectly on my desk! Now I get to play all my games in HD, and if necessary can hook it up to my computer for dual monitor action. The TV has actually decent sound for the size- I find myself just shelving my headphones most of the time due to comfortability.Coby has shined to me so far, as I've bought a few products of theirs and have been very happy with them.

Occassionally the channels need to be re-scanned. I have found this to be true on another brand we have. The problem is you lose all of your favorites and channel settings. Setting them up on this unit is really a pain in the butt and very time consuming.-----------------------------------------------------------------We bought this TV for the bedroom. Hooked it up to basic cable, plugged it in, easily found the menu and selected scan. Took about 5 minutes but it not only found all of the analog stations but an additional 60 digital channels. We have basic cable with no box so this was a surprise for us. It is initially bright but after some adjustment the picture quality for digital is pretty good for this price range.However, there are two major flaws. The speakers for this thing are par for what you get with any TV/monitor like this. The problem is you can't just add a set of external speakers. The only outlet is coaxil which requires an amplifier. This is not a TV you want to keep adding additional expenses.The other small but major flaw is that while you can turn the power light off while watching TV, the power light comes ON when the unit is off. Their tech support calls this sleep mode and say it is dim but in the bedroom at night it is very annoying.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great set for the price", "Author": "David \"David\"", "ReviewID": "R2D56MCE567KI2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this as a TV for viewing from about 4 feet away (next to my desk). Fine picture and OK sound. Easy to set up. Auto-find found digital channels without a cable box. Decided to try it as a monitor for a small laptop computer. Perfect, crystal clear picture. Am now using as a computer monitor and will buy another for the TV. Hard to beat the price for 1080p LED.Free shipping was slow from Amazon on this and it arrived 4 days late, but TV great for the price.December 7, 2011 follow up: I purchased a second unit for use as a computer monitor (it has VGA input plug). Worked great for about 3 weeks, then would shut off when warm and computer screen went blank for standby mode. Only way to get it to restart was to unplug power for half an hour or so (to cool off??) then reconnect power. Coby warranty is horrible, only 90 days and $25 shipping each way.Amazon was absolutely great! They allowed a return even though I initiated the request 2 days outside the 30-day window (because I troubleshot for a week until I gave up). Amazon immediately, with no hassle or discussion, allowed a return and gave me a prepaid shipping label. I could not ask for more. I was so pleased with Amazon I am ordering another Coby TV from them because I trust them to take it back if it is defective within a very short time.The TV is great when it works, but now I have one out of two which was defective. First one is working great and is currently my monitor while I wait for new Coby to arrive.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Coby LEDTV2226", "Author": "J.

I didn't need all the bells and whistles from a name brand, just something that worked. Unfortunately, after two straight have ended in a non-functioning TV, I can't recommend this product at all.The first TV came with a purple line right down the middle of it. I was informed that the set was bad and to return it for a new one in which I did. The next TV worked fine for about two weeks before it would no longer power on. At this point, it's just not worth the hassle of dealing with this brand and model.Perhaps I just have incredibly bad luck, but I don't think the hassle is worth saving a few bucks. I'll be sticking to more name brand products and dropping a few bucks more.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for what I need!", "Author": "Hector", "ReviewID": "R3PI8TBY4Z3QJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this TV for when i'm recording video game footage onto YouTube.

Milne", "ReviewID": "R38DS7KWLDCH9Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this and two of the Coby 19\" TV's for the bedrooms. The picture is really good, HD looks really sharp and the color is vibrant. One of the 19\" tv's doubles as a desktop computer monitor and works fine for that as well. If you do use the monitor function, you'll have to spend a little time in the display settings finding the right resolution and font size for the image to render in a way that is acceptable. The only caveat: the sound is really pretty bad and sounds like it's coming out of a tin can. :-( But, I read the other reviews and knew about this in advance. After all, how big could the speakers be on such a small and thin tv? Where would they put them? Personally, I think the small, down-firing speakers are fine for treble and mid-range, but the tv's sound could be vastly improved if they (and other small tv manufacturers) could put a large back-firing speaker in the rear for the bass. It would add that needed low range that is missing in these small sets. Great set for a small bedroom or on the wall facing a treadmill or similar. So far, so good after almost 30 days, and all three tv's with articulating wall mounts were under $500! :-)4/30/2012:All three sets are still working great, and I've increased the bass and decreased the treble and they sound less tinney, but the sound is still lacking and could be improved.

Without an external amplifier, I wouldn't have kept this TV, I couldn't make out dialogue from across a small room, at FULL volume. There IS a coaxial output for an amplifier, BUT, IF (as in my case) you hook the TV up to an HDMI cable, the coax output doesn't work (it's only for the built-in tuner). It's no problem to hook up the external amp to the RCA jacks on the HD box & TV, but then you have no remote volume control/mute (unless you have a remote-controlled amp, which I don't). I may look into another very small amp with a remote, it's a hassle as-is.Otherwise, this TV is fantastic for the price, the picture is incredible & setup with my HD box was very simple. Just anticipate the audio issues; the use of an external stereo for sound is a vast improvement for most any TV, for this one it's a necessity.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value!", "Author": "streetsense", "ReviewID": "R1TPRKRR3YG5GN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great tv.
