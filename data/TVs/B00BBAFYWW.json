{"Reviews": [{"Title": "There should be more stars ...", "Author": "J. Richards", "ReviewID": "R2BNAQA35Y8DYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is now updated, after having this unit for several months. The reliability story is still yet to be written. Unfortunately, that takes years.New as of October 7, 2013:Got another automatic update yesterday. I have not determined what changed. Anyway, since last review I played with the DLNA Receiver fuction. It was there all along, but I didn't understand it. Basically, you can \"Play To\" any DLNA device from any other. So I played some videos directly to the TV from my PC (MS Windows Media Player DLNA Library), my phone and my tablet. The TV just stops what it is doing and instantly starts rendering the requested material. Just make sure you have a robust connection directly between your media sever and the TV. You can even Play To from Youtube on your phone, or play a playlist. When the media is done, playng, the TV switches back to whatever it was doing beforehand.News as of August 29, 2013:- At the current price, $300 less than I paid, this unit has to be the deal of the century. Also see the 55 inch.- Just TODAY, the firmware was updated (both the TV and the smart remote). AMAZON PRIME IS NOW SUPPORTED!!! Yay, yes it's your birthday. Now, an almost perfect TV is beyond belief. Amazon Prime is playing in HD, output through the optical cable to my a/v receiver and the sound is home theater quality.Run, do not walk to get Amazon Prime: free shipping and thousands of free videos. Watching Dredd now.Original review follows.I don't think there is much point in discussing the well known obvious stuff. This is a top of the line 3D LED Smart TV. So you know what that means. And it is awesome. I can't compare with other brands, but I couldn't imagine better performance. This is the latest technology, stylishly packaged and with a dazzling array of features.I originally ordered the 2012 version (47LM8600) by accident due to the lack of a clear description that it was not the latest model. That being said, even the 2012 item was stunning in every respect. I was awestruck for the two days that I owned it. But when I missed a couple of expected features, that was when I discovered that did not have the 2013 model.In the interest of efficiency, I will defer to existing reviews of the 2012 version of this product (47LM8600), and briefly discuss the major differences found in the 2013 model (47LA7400).Styling: The 2012 model was better IMHO. This model has a clever swivel mechanism (Edited: thanks to R. Neal), but I do not like the ribbed chrome border around the screen. However, it is stronger  and easier to handle due to the more rigid frame.Audio: There is a \"subwoofer\" of sorts. The 2012 speakers were not bad, but there was very little bass. In this 2013 model, you are reminded of the lower registers, due to a large, slim, rear firing speaker. I hope that in 2014, a subwoofer output is added, and the sound will be vastly improved. Of course, the full range of sound is provided when you are listening through and external a/v system. Update: The subwoofer sounds even better today, now that the speakers have been broken in a bit (adjusted to temperature and humidity of my home.) Perhaps it is really that I have adjusted to the sound without the extra bottom of an external subwoofer. The result is still more balanced and deeper than typical TV built-in speakers.Remote: Redesigned for more comfort. Improved speech recognition, which is still listed as Beta. Gesture recognition - cool. You can draw \"603\" on the screen, and the TV will switch the cable box to that channel. Or you can speak \"Turn to MSNBC\". Amazing.Skype Camera: Same as 2012. Just confirming that it also works with 2013 model. Awesome picture and audio quality.HDD Access: Can be plugged into any of the 3 USB slots. Works a treat. I can play recorded HD content, pictures and music perfectly. Seamless access of files whether from external HDD, DLNA or network shares (SMB). The codecs and players on this TV rival the best I have on my fastest PC server, in their ability to render supported content. I can still support more formats on a PC of course (e.g. DVD ISOs, WMA). Update: I have noticed that more formats are supported from a USB HDD than DLNA. For example, over DLNA, a \".tp\" file is not recognized (unless renamed .ts), but from a HDD, the .tp file is recognized and plays just fine.USB: No longer specific designated ports. Any supported device can be plugged anywhere. User manual says even some hubs may work. (Updated: Wi-Fi is built in. No dongle needed on this model, even though the user guide shows a dongle - perhaps this varies by model, but I have confirmed that the 47LA7400 indeed has Wi-Fi built in.)Video: What can I say. Stunning. There is multi-level set of adjustments for all aspects of the video. Use the defaults or manipulate to your heart's content. I'm not sure whether this is the same or different from 2012.External Control: Definitely new for 2013 is the ability to control the TV using RS-232 (over USB). Complete specifications are available from the support site, as an appendix to an upgraded User Guide. IP control is not mentioned, but I would expect that it could be provided with a firmware update (as Sony did for the CX7000ES). Update: there is a tablet app for LG remote, so that implies IP controls are available.Amazon apps: Not (yet) available. I was told that these are more likely to be added to 2013 models than 2012. Amazon Instant Video is needed, and a Kindle app would be gravy. My Amazon mp3's play just fine with DLNA.That's it for now. Wish me luck. I am thinking about purchasing the extended warranty. I've seen the reviews with all the pros and cons of doing that. My one experience with customer support, via chat, was awesome. The Rep was helpful and well versed on all the details of the product.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEAUTIFUL DESIGN... A LOT OF FLAWS. DISAPPOINTED. I bought a few TV's & have included those comparisons in this review.", "Author": "Brandy.A.", "ReviewID": "R1ZKG7D0ET15UH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was in the market for 2 TV's with 3D and apps.  One for the living room the other the bedroom.  I'm a tech geek and I know what to look for.  I also do a lot of homework by reading forums, reviews, etc on any type of electronic before I make a purchase.  In a word, I'm picky.  You need to be picky, after all, it's your money and these things are not cheap.  After reading many reviews and forums, and going on prior experience with my older LG,  I made the choice to buy the 55LA7400.  Not only would I save a little money, but I would also get a nice TV with all the bells and whistles, or so I thought.  I also made the choice to buy the 47\" inch version of this TV for the bedroom as well.  Both arrived quickly from Amazon.  Packaging Great.  Set up, fairly easy.  TV -beautiful.  Here is where the joy quickly faded.Plugged the LG 55\" TV in, powered on.  Immediately noticed 2 red stuck pixels on the screen and some clouding in upper right and lower left sides of the TV.  There was also a little clouding mid-screen.  Very distracting to say the least.  Once past setup, I noticed some banding on picture.  Unacceptable!  It became very obvious rather quickly that LG's quality control department failed with this TV.  I had read about the lighting issues and uniformity issues on the forums, but it was pretty much hit or miss with some people.  Not every TV is perfect because some flaws are considered \"acceptable\" from the manufacture.  But this,  this was ridiculously bad.  I immediately scheduled a return with Amazon.  Next, came the 47\" inch set up.  As soon as it powered on,  the lower left corner of the TV had an estimated 100+ of black and white pixels going jagged and horizontal across the screen.  Another failure of LG's quality control.  The packaging was perfect, no damage.  It certainly was not Amazon nor the shipper's fault.  Again, another return.Frustrated and thinking I just had bad luck,  I went to BestBuy.  Looked at the floor model.  It appeared to have some clouding though minimal.  I went ahead and made a purchase anyway of an unopened box 55LA7400.  Got it home, set it up, powered on.  Again, 4 red stuck pixels on the screen, and some pinkish hue to only the right side of the screen.  Commence to banging my head on the wall in frustration.  TV returned.  Before returning, I did play around with the TV.  Calibration is somewhat ok out of box.  True Calibration not the easiest.  Their calibration tool will make it easier but still feels a little off in colors.  Picture was smooth, although I noticed some pixelation around the mouths of actors on TV.  No matter what I did, I couldn't get rid of this.  Colors tend to push to much yellow almost to the point of making some things appear greenish.  Watched MasterChef and the eggs on the show, the yolks appeared nearly green not yellow.  I tried many calibrations from CNET and AVS, none worked to correct issue.  Apps are not as snappy to load as other TV's though the interface is nice and responsive.  Remote is point and click which is a nice feature but will require a little patience for those not used to this sort of thing.  The magic remote is small, and comfortable in hand.  LG's app store is lacking in my opinion.  Many of their apps will cost you $.  This is not the case with Samsung which nearly all are free and there is no shortage in apps (see the last part of this review).  The LG does have the Amazon App now.  Lag is noticeable especially with gaming.  Gaming is horrible on this model and not recommended with you play any FPS games. My husband couldn't stand it.  Vizio did great in the gaming category and the Samsung surpassed both with gaming.  Sound quality of the LG was great.  This is the one thing I can give compliments to LG for.  Impressive sound.The LG processor lacks the power it needs especially when watching movies from VUDU in 3D.  You will have constant buffering.  LG also lacks enough memory in my opinion leading to even more issues with buffering.  I contacted VUDU and they are saying it's a compatibility issue with the HDX 3D and this LG model.  Normal 720p HD 3D through Vudu will play just fine with no buffering or minimal buffering.  I have a 50mbps connection, so this was not the issue.  If you get this TV, test a free demo of a 3D movie such as TRON or Tangled through VUDU in HDX and you see what I am talking about.  Vizio could play these with no issues and the Samsung even better with ZERO buffering.Bought a Vizio 60 M601D TV to save money and based on reviews, seemed to be a good TV although lacking in Apps.  TV, nice, slim but not nearly as thin as most.  Heavier for sure.  Apps are widget based, not pleasing to the eye and Amazon Instant is a huge failure on the Vizio.  3D was great.  Overall picture on par with LG, with a tad bit more graininess although not to noticeable.  No power buttons on back.  TV froze and locked up when accessing YouTube or Yahoo.  Only solution was to unplug from wall because when it froze remote became unresponsive.  TV returned.  Vizio admitted they were aware of issue.In the end I spent more, and got a Samsung 60\" UN60F8000.  My first Samsung ever, btw and  I have been in total awe ever since.  Perfect packaging, it felt like Christmas.  Perfect screen, flawless stunning picture.  So real it's unbelivable.  No pixelation issues.  Beautiful design, even prettier than LG and thinner! Extremely light weight too, yet solid.  The stand is solid metal!  The TV looks as if it is floating in mid air.  One reviewer from CNET stated they felt Samsung was giving away the ultra 4K in this model.  I have to agree.  I have never seen anything so perfect in a TV.  Apps are great, setup easy.  Tons of content for families.  Educational apps for kids.  Fitness apps, you name it.  Nearly all Apps are free.  Pandora, Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, VUDU, YouTube, Crackle, Web Browser, tons of 3D content -the most I have seen on any TV.  Interface simple, clean, beautiful.  Fast and Snappy.  No issues here.  3D awesome!  Gaming, nearly no lag unlike the LG which was horrible!  Upscaling and 2D-3D conversion is much better than LG.  Out of box configuration excellent.  Minor if any calibration needed.  Picture just stunning.  I am a very happy Lady now.  My husband is happy that I'm happy...finally!  I was so happy I got the 46\" Samsung UN46F7100 and again, a PERFECT TV.  Props to Samsung and their quality control.  You can read more of my review on my purchase of the Samsung UN60F8000 here at Amazon dated Sept. 10, 2013.Bottom line,  if you are looking for a great 3D tv with the perfect balance of quality, picture, and apps. Go with the Samsung.  Yes you will pay more, but you can actually see where your investment is.  If you want to save a little money, the LG is a good choice if you can get past some of the issues and if you get lucky enough to get a good tv.  As stated, my previous TV was an LG and I was quite happy with it for several years.  I just personally feel quality control is severely lacking now with LG.  Buying a TV shouldn't feel like you are playing the lottery to get a winner.  It's your money, you deserve a good TV with out issues or having to go through 4+ TV's just get a good one!", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome LED picture & sound (both 3D & 2D), NFC, and fun remote with voice recognition made me switch from Samsung", "Author": "Dr. M. A. Dixon \"hyper-observant\"", "ReviewID": "R2U47LDRIGDYSK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE:  This tv starred on The Celebrity Apprentice April 28, 2013 tv show as the latest and greatest.When you turn on this tv, the first thing you see is the logo - \"LG Life's Good\" and that does set the mood.  I do think this amazing LG 55LA7400 does make life good.The television itself is a beautiful piece of art which is lightweight and smooth enough to easily swivel on my wood stand when I desire to do so but you don't need to because of the new technology where every seat is a good seat from every angle.Picture is very vibrant and crisp; I can not think of any picture I have seen that is more crisp or vibrant.  As with all LEDs there is a reflection at times especially in black or when the television set is turned off in a brightly lit room.  It would be perfection in a dark theater room but alas mine is in a well-lit living room.  The 2D has so much depth to it that sometimes I think it is in 3D.  The video quality is simply amazing.I love that the thin bezel is black making it look like the television screen is just floating in air with no frame at all as it just disappears with the way human eyes perceive.Audio is robust, full and booming.  I think many people who have not invested in a home theater system would be happy with the audio and not need the additional investment unless you like the surround sound like I do and am used to with my 7-1 system.  There has definitely been improvements made in audio and video technology that comes with the higher end sets like this model.  The audio installed on this LG 55LA7400 is as good as any separately sold 2.1 system I have heard.  It is impressive.No problem with ethernet internet connection or with using the Smart TV apps installed on the TV, I entered my HuluPlus username and password and had access to my account immediately.  This LG 55LA7400 does have built-in wifi - no dongle needed.  When I watch Steven Colbert on HuluPlus through this SmartTV's app, it strobes with what looks like a low refresh rate but the tv says it has 240Hz so I plug my computer into one of the tv's HDMI inputs and watch the exact same show and now when Steven makes hand gestures or high fives intern Jay, they look good as hdtv digital broadcasts so the problem isn't with this tv's refresh rate.DLNA connections to pc and smartphone work flawlessly.  This LG LA557400 comes also with a cool Tag On feature which is a data transmission technology that can be used on android  4.0+ smartphones with NFC (Near Field Communication).  Simply by tapping your smartphone to a Tag On sticker, you can share content between your smartphones and TV.  You know in the commercials where you can just touch the two new smartphones to each other to share information?  That is NFC and this model comes with that technology!  This is news to me of this technology being used with smartphone to tv NFC transfer - whoever thought of that, BRAVO!  To connect your smartphone to the TV using Tag On, they must be connected on the same Wi-Fi network or Miracast/Intel's WiDi of the smart TV is set to On.  The directions say to not attach the sticker to a metal part of the TV or your smartphone cannot recognize the Tag On sticker.  It also says to not crumple or fold the Tag On sticker or it will not be recognized.  You can purchase Tag On stickers from LG Electronics Service Centers but my box had one in it.  This Tag On feature is super cool and works great with my Galaxy s3.The magic remote is super cool.  It will come on if you shake left-right or touch 1 of 3 designated buttons closest to your thumb.  You can control it just by moving it around in your hand and doesn't require the direct pointing at the tv like the old IR infra-red technology.  Moving the remote downwards will bring up your app menu which include your input list, settings, internet, search, OnNow, LG Smart Mall, LG Cloud, Game World, Universal Control, User Guide, Smart Share, Channel List, Recent List, LG Smart World, 3D World, K-Pop Zone, Social Center, Videos, Photos, Music SimpLink and Quick Menu.  Skype app is on here but camera is not included.  If you purchase model LG Electronics 55LA8600 55-Inch Cinema Screen 3D 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV, Built-In Camera and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses you will get the built-in camera which also allows for your control of the tv with finger gestures.  Amazon VOD is not on yet but is scheduled to update through firmware to all the LG SmartTVs any day now.  You can browse Amazon, shop, and purchase but it won't load videos through the browser, I just get error messages.  The voice recognition works as well or better than Siri and Android and this makes web browsing fairly easy but a keyboard pops up that you can use when needed using the point and click method and arrowing/scrolling around and clicking.  For example, I can touch the microphone key and ask \"how many liters are in a gallon?\" and the tv will take me to the web page search that has the answer to the question.  I can also use voice to turn to ShowTime or Channel 63 or I can draw 63 in the air with the remote and it will turn to channel 63.  Pretty slick!  Although the Smart Remote would not control my Onkyo Home Theater as promised, the LG 55LA7400 is awesome in so many other ways such as voice recognition that I am going to keep it right next to my Harmony One remote, keyboard, and mouse and use all four.I do not care for 2D to 3D conversion at all as it just looks to fake and gimmicky for me.  You know like when you go to the amusement park and enter the FunHouse of Mirrors that are warped in all different ways so that you look even more wierd in every mirror you look in?  That is what the 2D to 3D conversion is like IMO.  You get a more real-to-life with depth in the 2D and in order to have 3D look good it, the video needs to be produced to be shown in 3D so that someone is fixing all the effects to have the effect that makes since.  The 55LA7400's 3D display of box office 3D movies is just as good as in the theater!  You can view 3D either from DVD or internet broadcast.  I watched Step Up in 3D from the LG store and I highly recommend it as it played flawlessly and definitely showed off the cool factor of this awesome LG LED HDTV.  The 2D has so much amazing depth to it that sometimes it looks 3D to me.I knew one could watch 3D from 3D dvds played in a 3D player but I did not realize that there is so much avaialable online in 3D as well.  From the SmartTv, for $5.99, I could stream in 3D any of the following:  Wreck-It Ralph, Monsters, Brave, Step Up, Up, Alice in Wonderland, G-Force, Finding Nemo, Frankinweenie, Bolt, Hana Montana, Mars Needs Moms, Tron, Tangled, and many more.  I have a 20MBps download feed and everything streamed in beautiful 3D flawlessly.  LG 55LA7400 reminds you to put on your 3D glasses!  The glasses are lightweight and comfortable by the way.  Included with this television were 4 pair of 3D glasses in one box.There was a new TV Firmware update available.  You can set the TV to update automatically if you want which I did.  It took approximately 5 minutes for my 20MBps to update the installed 03.07.20 to 03.20.25.  This firmware has 7 display settings:  Vivid, standard, eco, cinema, game, expert1 and expert2.  Some of my friends like to change settings depending upon whatever they watch.  I like to optimize for the location where it is at and then write down the settings on the back of my manual just in case it ever loses the settings I can reset it to my preferences for my location without having to re-figure it out.  I think it is worth the extra $200 to have high-end tvs like this calibrated for the location you place them.  While the pre-sets will probably get them 80-90% perfect, that last percentage that a computerized calibration service can do for you can pop out lines on a lizard you did not realize were there and such.Although previous televisions came from Amazon to me through UPS sometimes making it here undamaged other times not, this television was delivered and set up by CEVA who does contract television delivery work for not only Amazon but also our large local big box electronics stores here in this large city.  CEVA and similar companies are definitely the way to go over UPS so you can get white glove treatment and have them take back the tv if it was damaged in transit as they help you unbox it and set it up which really is a 2-person task with a 55\" television.Important tip:  save the box.  If you move, the first thing the moving company will ask is \"do you have the box it came in?  if not, that will be an additional $80!\"The LG 55LA7400 is a beautiful piece of art HDTV with gorgeous crisp vibrant picture showing amazing depth and full booming audio and the most fun remote ever.  I can not recommend it enough.  You will be so delighted.  Also, another thing I really love about the tv is the logo.  I really like being reminded whenever I turn the tv on - LG Life's Good.  Best logo and tv ever!UPDATE:  I included the computerized calibration settings in the comments on this review below.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply stunning", "Author": "Chicago Book Addict", "ReviewID": "R1Q1M9NJU79SMS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this TV for a week now and I have to say, it's stunning!  I also own the 2012 version of this TV (LG Cinema Screen 47LM7600 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses)  and was expecting minor improvements at best over that model.  Not to mention I LOVE that TV so it was hard for me to imagine how much better it could get.  So I was pleasantly surprised at the enhancements in this model - namely the quality of the picture, the sound, and the improvements to the smart aspects of the TV.  While it's too soon to tell on lifespan, my 2012 LG TV has continued to perform well over time so I'm confident this TV will do the same.Before you read the rest of the review it's important to note that while I did do a fair amount of research before buying my first LG TV I'm by no means a TV expert so this review comes from the perspective of someone who appreciates a high quality TV viewing experience, but doesn't understand every technical in and out. Consider me your slightly savvy average consumer.  Warning, this review is a tad long since there are so many aspects of owning a TV.  Accordingly, I organized my points into buckets so that hopefully it is easier to skip to the parts that interest you if necessary.Set up:My TV came with white glove delivery standard so it made set up a breeze.  Mine came through Ceva Logistics and they carried the TV up to my condo (a huge plus since I live in a 3rd floor walk up), removed it from the box, and set up the stand for me.  They also turn the TV on while they are there allowing you to check for any damage before they leave.  If you've ever been worried you're more at risk for receiving a damaged TV by ordering online this offers huge piece of mind.  (Though I now have 3 LG TVs all from Amazon and have yet to receive one that was damaged or defective.)As for the TV itself, there are just a few set up screens and then you are in business, though some individual apps also have their own short set up to validate your accounts (i.e. Facebook).  You will also though likely want to calibrate the picture and sound before watching.  I personally liked the results far better when I did this vs. when I used the TV with the preset settings.  Even if you are a relative neophyte like I am, there are a lot of great resources online that can help you do this.  Also, there is thankfully nothing you can do that can't be undone so if you create a setting you don't like it is easy enough to change it.  I also found connecting it to wifi to be very easy.  It found my network right away and accepted my password.Picture quality:Once the TV was properly calibrated I was quite satisfied with the viewing quality I have with this TV.  I thought the detail, vibrancy of the colors, and depth of the black with this TV were great when watching cable television, movies (DVD and Bluray), and playing video games on the PS3.  I also paid close attention (closer than normal) when watching for flashlighting and bleeding.  I noticed some flashlighting when the TV was first booting up, but nothing was detectable during actual viewing.I also think the TruMotion 240Hz does a great job of managing motion blur and judder.  It's on par with my 2012, though I had no complaints with that TV to begin with.  At least from my experience it seems like you're always going to get a little bit of both with LED-LCD TVs but this TV seemed to handle both well, even when I was watching for both with a more scrutinizing eye than normal for the purpose of writing this review.  It also handles both better than the LG Electronics 42LA6200 42-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses, though the differences were more subtle than I might have expected.I also thought that the TV did a good job when viewing it from side angles.  I did find that the contrast was a little less pronounced then, but still the viewing quality was pretty good.  The option of energy saving features is also nice though I personally like a brighter TV experience so I generally opt not to use them.  Also, from everything I've read and my own viewing experience this TV doesn't seem to have a matte screen.  However, I've found that while I do see slight reflections from the can lights in my ceiling when the TV is off or on the start up screen, I don't notice any reflection when I'm actually watching it.Sound:Typically I watch TV with a home theater system so I'm not reliant on the sound quality of the TV.  However the built in 2.1 speakers work noticeably better than both the LG Cinema Screen 47LM7600 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses and LG Electronics 42LA6200 42-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses and I like that there are different settings for the sound.  It definitely has a much fuller sound than these other 2 LG models.  I found it sufficient for TV and web video viewing and most movie viewing. Though because I already own a home speaker system my preference will still be to use that, especially when watching movies with a lot of sound effects.The only thing I haven't found is a solution for shows with laugh tracks in the background.  Thankfully these are few and far between but when I watch them, the laugh track sometimes sounds a little louder than what I'm used to.  I've been playing around with the various sound settings and I haven't found a solution so if anyone has it please leave it for me in the comments section of the review.  I would very much appreciate that.Functionality:One of my favorite things about the TV, beyond the picture quality is how easy it is to access a range of content.  I love being able easily use YouTube, Hulu Plus, Netflix, Pandora, Picasa, and Facebook.  I think it is possible that I could drop my cable subscription and still be quite pleased with how much I'm able to use this TV.  At least at the time of writing this review, Spotify and Amazon Instant Video are absent.  However, Amazon Instant Video was recently added to my 2012 TV so it seems realistic it will be added here soon as well.I also have been pleased with the experience of using these services within the TV.  `On Now,' which is new in 2013 has become a huge favorite of mine.  Basically it learns from your viewing habits and offers recommendations from live TV and video on-demand services that you can click to right off the Smart TV screen.  So far it's recommended some programs I wouldn't have otherwise known were on and is a much more visual and engaging way to browse my cable channels than the cable guide interface.Among the bunch the only interface I've found that I haven't liked is Facebook.  (It's a very dumbed down version of the Facebook experience and I dislike that when I look at my wall it omits links and pictures from people's posts, which makes for an unsatisfying experience.)  Everything else has been easy to use.  I especially like that YouTube works with my phone (as long as you are using both on the same wifi network) so I can use my phone to control what plays on my TV, including finding videos.  I've been especially pleased with the speed and quality.  When I'm watching YouTube videos, for example, they load quickly and I don't have any problems with buffering.  I do find with all these programs I spend much more time on my butt in front of the TV than I did pre-Smart TV.  Thanks to the addition of a dual core processor, I also find that web browsing is faster than it is with my 2012 TV, though it is still slower than with my MacBook.Remote:The Magic Remote comes standard with this TV.  I was already sold on the Magic Remote technology based on the 2012 version.  If you've ever used a Wii, it is incredibly intuitive to use and makes navigating complex menus and screens a breeze.  I love that with this 2013 TV they've added the ability to use it to control my cable box and voice control.  I didn't think I'd use the latter but it's actually been a great way to find cable channels quickly when I'm not sure what number they are.  Saying `Find HGTV' is turning out to be pretty handy and I actually find the voice recognition to be more accurate than Siri on my iPhone, at least so far.  (Though in fairness, all my commands/requests with this TV are pretty simple and often just a couple words.)Aesthetics:I love that like my 47LM7600, this TV offers LG's Cinema Screen design, which makes the TV virtually frameless.  This was one of the things I LOVED about my 47LM7600 because it makes the TV fit in nicely in a well-decorated living room.  It also gives this TV an edge over the LG Electronics 42LA6200 42-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses , which instead has a beveled edge so it is a little less sleek and modern looking, but nonetheless still looks pretty nice.  The Cinema Screen does come with a higher price tag so I think you have to decide for yourself it if is worth the extra expense.I will also say I was initially skeptical of the chrome bar on the bottom of the TV because I thought it might draw attention away from the TV picture itself, but it's much less bright and reflective than it looks in the pictures here.  I find that it isn't distracting and actually looks thinner and less obtrusive than the similar bar on the bottom of my 47LM7600.Overall, I love, love, love this TV.  It reminds me a lot of how I felt when I went from an iPhone 4 to an iPhone 5.  The 2012 version of this TV was already pretty great and I was quite satisfied and the new additions and enhancements take my viewing experience over the top.

It comes with four pairs of non-powered 3D glasses.Since it connects to the internet, you can get content directly instead of having to use a separate device (like a blu-ray or Xbox) for services like Netflix. You can also browse the web, but it is probably better to use it for videos or video-based content, including some games (that you have to pay for). If you have one of these TVs and a blu-ray (and the current Xbox 360) I don't see how getting one of the new Xbox models is really going to be essential.This TV also can be set to know where you are and can help you choose content you like, based on what you have watched before.Our other HDTV is a 47 inch Vizio with 4 HDMI, one Component and one RGB / computer input.The set was delivered by Ceva and the box was not as big and did not seem as heavy as I expected. The packing material is Styrofoam, but they ship these things all over the world, and I don't think the packaging was excessive. I did not have them set it up, so my son and I did it and it was quite straightforward.This TV is also very nice looking, even when not turned on.

The one thing to consider however, if you do not have a 3D audio/video receiver, you will not get real 3D to pass through if all connected through the receiver, BUT, if you connect your HDMI cable from your cable box or sat box directly to the TV, then run the optical or digital coax from the back of the cable or sat box to your optical or digital coax inputs on the back of your receiver, then you will get full real 3D from your TV and super great surround sound.

I was.  The 3D shows have added depth, but nothing is projected outside the screen.  And when I try and convert 2D to 3D I notice eye strain almost immediately.  It is so bad, I do not watch it.  My kids were thrilled about the 3D functionality, but have not opted to use it much either.Energy Saver--Another feature which I was really excited was the energy saver option.  Our TVs are almost always on, and it does eat up a lot of energy.  This feature simply dims the picture until it becomes miserably dark.  You do not pick up this TV, to watch a sad shadow of programming.  We do not use this function either.Sound--My last gripe is the sound.  Unless this is hooked up to a home theater system, not much sound makes it out of this set.  It just doesn't fill the room at any level.Pros:Set-Up--I've never had a TV that was easier to set up or use.  Set up took about 20 minutes all inclusive.  From the base to the wifi.Apps--This TV was just made for me.  It came pre-loaded with HULU, NetFlix and Youtube apps.  I can access it with one touch of a button.  I can also control these apps on my devices without any extra set up.  And the TV comes with access to a decent library of films for rent.Magic Remote--The remote is genius.  It is similar to a mouse and is probably even more intuitive.  My four year old mastered it instantly.  It feels good in your hand and is streamline to perfection.Visual--This set is so thin.  Thinner than any TV I have ever seen in person.  When you are sitting in my living room, it really does look like a cinema screen.  The base doesn't look it, but is surprisingly stable.

A product review makes no sense if a manipulation is possible by the manufacturer.**********Final Update, 21. December 2013All (3) repair attempts have failed. The repair man from the authorized service was also disappointed as he could not fix the TV after all the visits. He exchanged the front panel once, and twice the motherboard covering about a 2 month time frame. When he visited the last time, he had a long call with LG. They finally came to the conclusion that the malfunction is not due to the motherboard but the panel, which had been replaced initially. After a lot of calls and e-mails to LG (demanding to talk to a supervisor finally), LG eventually decidedto send me a new TV in exchange. This would have meant a few more weeks to wait.Asking for some kind of reimbursement for all the lost time that I could not use my new TV properly,not to mention days of wasted efforts on my side too, this request was immediately declined.This is a 'service' that lets any customer run away from buying any LG device in the future. LG: Take Amazon as an example what customer service really means.So I accepted to just get a new TV and send back mine, but after a couple of days I got a call back from LG thatthey cannot exchange the TV. Their reason was the fact that I bought the TV online from Amazon, whatever this means for them.The only way to proceed was to refund the original price after I sent back the TV. Well, I fully agreed with this offer as I have no trust anywayin LG products anymore. To be fair, the ladies at the call centerwere all polite (they have to), but this did not solve any technical issue.Now I received my money back and have my old Samsung TV dusted off and connected to a Roku player.I have to say this was the best decision since using a Roku player opens up much more smarter options than any so-called smart LG TV.The LG TV was not smart at all, slow to connect to servers, limited with apps and options, and the 'magic' control is a big pain too. I had to constantly wake up this thing by shaking around. The Roku remote is great to use and so much better than the LG magic remote control. The magic control is a technology not well developed yet. When it worked, it did not fully replace the remotes of other decives, only some features of my set top box and TV worked. Also, it often lost the remote assignment (needs re-programming via the TV wizard again) or was completely unresponsive. I had to use the original remote controls then anyway including the DVD and amplifier it did not cover at all.I learned my lesson from the bad LG experience.1) No LG product anymore2) Do a detailed research, do not rely on advertisement, and also carefully study the serious reviews with lower ratings.Then either invest in other products or just safe your money since your 'older stuff' might do the job just fine. New technologiesdo often not satisfy the expectations and are manufactured with lousy quality not comparable to older days. This is an experience notonly based on this LG TV, but a large set of items.********Update 3B, 14. November 2013We had another visit from the authorized repair service today bringing in the long-awaited (brand new) circuit/mother board to eventually fix the TV.To no avail! THE REPAIR FAILED AGAIN! I also had a chat with someone from the upper LG management today about how to go on. There is no resolution yet and I am once again on the waiting line for a few business days (!!!), though now the TV has been decided to be replaced after 3 failed repair attempts.So far I have lost multiple hours e-mailing, chatting and having to provide proof myself (!!!!!!) how often I have had a service call and whatthe service history was. I had to be at home for all service repairs loosing valuable time and money on this, which I estimate tobe in range of the costs of the TV at the first place. What in the world is going on with LG. We are in the 3rd month with a dysfunctional TV and waiting...LG clearly said they will not reimburse me by any means for not having a fully functioning TV for this long and there is nothing they can do! Well, thanks to LG or should I abbreviate LB.The lesson learned: Do not buy anything from LG.To LG: Learn from Amazon, what it takes to satisfy customers, if a failure occurs. Errors may happen, are human or just based on technological flaws, it is however necessary to approach customers such they feel confident as to how the issue is remedied towards a full satisfaction instead of leaving customers fully upset. The latter is true with me. It is not ok to let the customers do the work for LG, e.g. to provide a full history of calls as a prerequisite to go on with the repair service (what does it matter anyway how often I called, it does make things only worse!) instead of providing simply the service to fix the device once and for all !$%^&#", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Set!!!!", "Author": "Michelle Wiseman", "ReviewID": "R14OYN5Q5HHRDC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first state, that Amazon's delivery date was a bit off, with their carrier, Ceva, delivering a day late. The tv was delivered in perfect condition however, and it looks stunning on its stand. I had researched this particular model extensively, with regard to its back lighting method versus the edge lighting type of its sister set, LG's flagship LA8600 model, with the only differences other than the aforementioned backlit/edge lit method being the Skype camera(which I have no use for) and one additional HDMI input, for substantially less money. Back lit technology, from what I have researched, is more expensive for the manufacturer to produce, hence the proliferation of edge lit sets that can be had. That being said, I notice that Amazon is charging $150 more for it now than 2 weeks ago, glad I ordered it when I did. Now for some 1st hand experience with this model. To begin, the TV's built in calibration software isn't all that bad, and very easy to accomplish, perhaps even enough for most to be pleased with the color/clarity in the end, but being the perfectionist I am, I always want the best from anything I purchase, so I opted to tweak both mentioned areas according to a supposed professional calibration chart that I came across in my research and printed out. It had all sorts of settings to plug into the set with regards to white point setting within the ISF Expert 1 option, settings to plug in within the Picture Option heading as well as others to plug in under the Expert Mode heading. Most were pretty good, but I eventually opted to tweak some of those settings other than those which were stated in the 'professional' calibration one, and I have to say that this set has amazing color and clarity to rival ANY of it competitors, other than Ultra HD or OLED, of course. The 3D is amazing, 2D to 3D unbelievable, and personally, truthfully, I have found this set's sound capabilities outstanding, finding no need to supplement its sound with an AV device, or even a sound bar of any kind. The built in subwoofer on the backside of this set really enhances the sound, I have the settings set to Cinema, virtual surround ON, with clear voice ON and tweaked to my liking...you may think otherwise, but I am impressed with the sound, far better than more expensive competition. I have this paired with a Sony 3D wifi Blu Ray, and couldn't be happier. I have the LG linked to the Net wirelessly thru My NetGear router, and have nary a problem utilizing Netflix, although I feel it necessary to suggest you Not try to stream anything in 3D which is far more of a data hog than a regular movie or show....you might encounter buffering even with a decent@30mbps download speed connection, just the nature of the beast so to speak. Save your 3D stuff for the Blu Ray player, you'll be glad you did. The remote while not perfect in all regards, is not bad at all, and I especially appreciate the voice commands I can give it, especially browsing through You Tube....oh, and btw, you might find it easier and better to use You Tube through the TV's browser rather than through the supplied built in App- I could give You Tube voice commands(easier than using the remote's cursor in the built in App), and I think you get more choices as far as content, just as you might using your computer on this site.....just a suggestion/observation. All in all, I must say I am thrilled with this set's quality/picture/features, and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a 60\" that you don't have to take a 2nd mortgage out to be able to afford.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Picture very happy with purchase", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "RGH68P0HVJWWE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about 3 weeks and the picture is amazing.

LG collects your viewing data, in order to advertise on the smart screen home page, this would not be a big issue, every internet browser does the same, however, there is a menu to turn the data collection off, but it does in reality nothing, it's just a scam at this point. Even worse, if you play data from your USB connected device, it is collecting the file names as well. This goes beyond data collection for commercials, this is a big privacy concern. They say a future firmware update will enable the function of being able to turn it off, but they deliberately build in a check box to turn data collection off, knowing that it is just a fake and does not do anything, until they got caught right handed.Sorry, but even though the picture is great (well, not on mine due to the defect), it is enough to not keeping it.If you are looking at a 3D TV with a awesome image quality, this is for you if the scam LG was trying to pull does not bother you.

Going to the TV, it \"found\" my folder and listed all my media in various ways like Folder, Artist, etc. The next day, I chose my music folder and discovered a BUNCH of single MP3 songs that I never heard of floating on top of my list of mP3 folders! The TV decided to download all that free promo music that I HATE from the Internet! To get to MY music, I had to scroll through all that music that I HATE, just to get to my songs. So I thought...I'll just delete them. NO WAY. Those songs are there to stay. I haven't given up yet. I might find a solution some day to get rid of that \"music\".How I fixed that: I put all my media on a Hard Drive and play it through the USB inputs. The DLNA server is still on, but I'm not currently using it.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~But then...there's the AN-MR400G \"MAGIC\" REMOTE!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~****Please do not use my review about this remote to decide NOT to buy this TV****It is a fine TV at a great price, and free Prime delivery and points are huge pluses.If you want to unify the inputs & audio for very little cost, that's an option, and I have described how to do that, in detail, below.Again, some of you will actually love the remote. I've been playing with the \"Voice\" thing and it really works good and it always understands what I say.The following is my review of the \"Smart\" remote design.*F.Y.I: I am using the remote at less than 15 feet from the TV and the batteries are good.First, the good thing: It has a cursor just like a computer mouse (in RF). A good feature for surfing the Internet on this TV.Read on.....I like to clone all my remotes into my unified learning remote MX-500. (A matter of choice and convenience). I can't stand having a pile of remotes to choose from.This LG remote operates on 2.4 Ghz RF, and CAN'T be cloned with a regular IR learning remote. However, the Power button is IR and that's the only thing on this remote that can be cloned.I have unified that power button, but I can't put that TV remote away like I have in the past.When I tried to unify my DishNet DVR and LG DVD player with this remote, what a nightmare mix of the navigation buttons with missing functions and that pesky cursor arrow sleeping and killing the navigation buttons that was! You would think of all the brands out there, the LG DVD player buttons would be complete, but there's no EJECT button. You can click around in the menus with the 4 transport buttons, but if you pause for 5 seconds, the cursor goes to sleep and then you can't control the DishNet menu buttons with the remotes transport buttons any more. You have to shake the remote like crazy every time there's a 5 second lapse when navigating the DishNet menus. What a pain!The remote's cursor SLEEPS after only 5 SECONDS of non use, then POOF!, you find that all the menu steps you went through to get to where you were are now LOST, and you have to start over! Then you have to VIOLENTLY SHAKE that remote to wake it back up.  The instructions say to move the remote \"slightly\" to the left and right to restore the cursor.NO WAY! Is something wrong with my remote? Maybe it should have a mercury switch rather that what it has. Then just handling the remote gently will wake it up.I called LG Tech about the sleep time and they said it was timed short to save battery life. REALLY? There REALLY needs to be a \"remote sleep time adjustment\" built into this TV for people that can afford to buy a couple AA batteries more often or use rechargeable batteries. How about a FIRMWARE UPDATE about the cursor timing, LG!The Power, Volume up/down, Channel up/down are direct. The power button is IR and the other buttons are RF. The 3D button brings up a one click menu to select the 3D mode, but then...it recognizes 3D content and you just exit out without clicking anything. If you want 2D to 3D, you can select that, and the 2D conversion is better quality than I thought it would be. All other buttons on this remote are deeply menu driven.My Bose Cinemate is Analog Audio (Simple RCA L/R jacks) and so are my Sennheiser wireless headphones. This TV has a Headphone jack that would have worked, but I couldn't get it to work, and I'm pretty good at settings. This TV also has an Optical Toslink audio output, so I purchased this inexpensive converter adapter from Amazon and it solved my Audio problem: B009GER8A6So, readers...I think I have tamed down and transposed most of the often used functions to my MX-500 remote. Some of you might think that LG remote is just fine, but those of you that hate the remote, I have offered a way to control your FINE LG TV the easiest way possible.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~OK LG, Are you listening?LG...When we watch TV, we want our remotes to FUNCTION properly and easily, with MINIMUM navigation. We don't actually like your idea of a \"Year 2050 Jetson's remote\" that actually DEGRADES your fine TV by making it almost totally menu driven. (When it works right).LG...You should return to designing remotes with all the buttons on it so we can address the settings DIRECTLY, instead of having to navigate through a maze of complicated menus to do things we do every day. How can you possibly think that this remote is handy or easy?LG...Keep the RF mouse cursor in RF. It's handy for the INTERNET, but please make the rest of the buttons IR, so if we wish to unify the remote into one remote, we will have that choice.LG...If you decide to keep designing this remote the way YOU THINK WE LIKE IT, at least add a sleep time adjustment in a firmware update if that is possible.Fix the INPUT button so is shows ALL of the inputs without any menu navigation.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE:The sluggishness or full cache \"sticky mouse\" delay problem (my description) I had described has completely stopped. It might have been just the TV being busy downloading Apps or something like that when it was new. Maybe it was fixed by a firmware update. I have removed that part from my review.I have learned to navigate better with the function buttons.I'm going to buy a \"compatible\" LG IR remote and try it. I really don't need that RF web cursor.It is now over a month since I bought this TV and the remote batteries are still working, so saving batteries is NOT the issue with the sleep timer.Makes me wonder why LG puts so much emphasis on putting that remote's RF cursor arrow to sleep in 5 seconds.A few days ago, there was a HUGE update that came in on broadband to the TV. I was hoping it was so we could adjust the \"time to sleep\", or set it at 20 seconds (my suggestion), but it wasn't. I really can't tell what that update was for.If LG could fix that quick sleep problem with a firmware update, I would be happier.Is it possible that they CAN'T add an adjuster in the settings or make it a static 20 seconds with a firmware update?UPDATE 10/18/13:(FYI: My TV is the 60 inch with the silver color RF magic remote).Because I have been seeking a solution to unifying that RF remote, I took a gamble for $29 and purchased a LG Remote Model AKB73756506. Although Amazon does not carry this remote, I found it at electronicadventure dot us, (yes, dot us) and it arrived fast, 6 days later. This remote controls ALL the TV's features except the RF cursor. So now I know the TV understands IR remotes also.UPDATE 11/01/13:I just cloned all the new IR remotes function buttons into my MX-500 remote and now the TV remote is unified and well tested.As for surfing the web with the RF remote's mouse cursor, I'll always have to get the RF remote out for that, but I don't normally use the TV for the internet anyway.UPDATE 11/11/13:This has to do with unifying Dishnet Hopper remotes, and a lot of us have Dishnet Hoppers.The Hopper v.40.0 remote uses RF and IR.In the Hopper \"Remote Settings\", you can actually turn on the IR capabilities.That's great, but for some reason, the 4 colored buttons and the search button either remain RF or just won't clone to the MX-500.Those Red, Green, Yellow & Blue buttons are very handy in Hopper navigation, but you can get the same thing with extra button pushes.So, I gambled again and bought a Dishnet remote control model Dish211 from Amazon for $13.95 here: B007JIBAVEThis great little remote has a RF/IR switch. It arrived in 2 days.I flipped the switch in the battery compartment to IR, inserted 4 AAA batteries, and all the IR functions worked perfectly with the Hopper!Then I cloned the colored buttons and \"search\" into my MX-500 remote.My MX-500 is fully programmed now for TV, Dishnet, & Blu-Ray. I am happy!I have removed the info above about the HDMI SWITCHING device. It was HDCP capable, but it will not pass a 3D HDMI signal for some reason.If your TV doesn't pass 3D, the 3D Dishnet PPV channels won't show in the guide. So....I put the HDMI cables back on the TV's HDMI inputs and that fixed it.However, now that I have the TV's remote functions cloned, the inputs are much easier to set now.The batteries in the original LG remote are still good after 86 days.Please comment if this helped you.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tv never looked so good", "Author": "Carlton Kiser", "ReviewID": "R301W5XSU7624D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several flat screens in the past.

I've had several LG televisions but this one takes the cake.  Picture is amazing and the screen is beautiful.  The first show i watched on it was House of Lies and the skin tones looked perfect.  If you are debating whether or not to buy this, dont.  Make the plunge.Gamers Perspective:I use this for my Xbox One.  I have not played Titanfall on it yet (so im not sure about response time), but NBA 2K14 worked flawlessly.  There was no need to adjust my shots so the response time is good.  This TV REALLY brings out the Next Gen graphics, so any of you with a PS4 or Xbone need to pike this unit up ASAP.One issue that i dont know is related to Xbox or just how great the TV is, but initially I plugged my cable box into my Xbox and noticed it wasnt as clear as it was when the cable box was hooked directly to TV.  its not a slight difference..its a substantial one.  if you own this tv and an Xbox one, i suggest you try both ways...then stick with cable box directly to TV.3D:I am not a big 3D person, but i have to say i was impressed with my first experience with passive 3D.  Watched some of the free videos that they give you and it never gets old watching a fish come at your head.REMOTE:I see a lot of people saying the remote is complicated.  It really isnt. if you have any idea how to use tech, you will be fine.  I use the scroll for my guide and i love it.  Unfortunately the remote doesnt work with my XBox one, but oh well.FLAWS:-Wow these speakers are terrible.  i bought a sound bar within 20 seconds of having the TV. however thats most TVs anyway, so i cant blame LG.-The microphone on the remote doesnt work while watching tv. you have to actually navigate to the Search Section on your TV , then hit it.  Minor inconvenience, but they dont really specify it anywhere.Overall 5 stars.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommended!", "Author": "datruem0", "ReviewID": "RBIOAYVGEQ5ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, this TV is sold at the cheapest price I have seen anywhere. Second of all, if you check CNET and lcdtvbuyingguide.com this LED HDTV is ranked among the top three! Now for the break down. After COUNTLESS hours of research I decided to buy this TV and I am very glad.Picture Quality:The picture quality is amazing once you calibrate it correctly. There is one or two recommended calibration setting online but i did not find those to be very helpful. The most helpful to me was using the caliberation tool that comes built in to the TV. It is easy to use and brings out the best of the TV. The only tip i have is if you have a dark or not very well lit room you may want to turn down the \"backlight\" on your screen setting to around 60. If you have a well lit room then turn it up to 70 or 80 depening on your preference. This will alleviate the screen light uniformity issue that LED TV's are notorious for.Refresh Rate:The 240hz refresher rate is overkill because all cable providers in the USA only broadcast at 60hz. You really see the 240hz come to life when you are streaming movies or watching DVD/Blu-Ray. So if you would rather opt for the LG 60LA6200, which is pretty much an identical TV with the lesser refresher rate of 120hz for a cheaper price then you are better off saving that money.3D:I don't know much about 3D, but the picture seems to be pretty good and crisp. The cool thing you can convert any content on your TV in to 3D.Cinema Screen:The screen is very sleek with barely any edge which makes it very attractive. It's a glossy (clear coat) finish which makes it highly reflective, but it is still better than the matte finish screen because it is brighter and more defined. You may have to play with the placement of lamps or lighting as you feel appropriate.TV Stand:The stand is actually quite awesome. It is easy to put on and has clasps attached to hold your TV wires in place behind the stand so the apperance of your overrall TV is better. The stand also swivles left and right for you to watch at an angle with out having to \"move\" the TV.\"Smart\" Features:I like the smart features on this TV. It is responsive and quite easy to follow and function. Most of the apps and features are cost based BUT you can dowload things like Pandora and use it for free on your TV. My favorite is the YouTube feature where you can connect your phone and just project any YouTube video to your TV in HD. You can also project almost anything off of an array of devices if you connect them to the TV.Magic Remote:Awesome remote. Looks very futuristic and works like a charm. Sometimes it takes a few shakes before the remote arrow shows on your screen but it's no big deal at all.WiFi:Wifi connection is simple and fast. I have no complaints.Overrall:This LED HDTV is an AWESOME addition to anyone's home. You have to be a bit tech savvy and appreciative of newer technology because it is a TV at the higher end of \"middle\" class TVs. I find this TV to be an awesome bang for your buck, especially considering the performance of the competition. The only worthy competitor to me now is Samsung because LG has really stepped their game up.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures, Smart: Not So.", "Author": "Shubham", "ReviewID": "RFB1LGY8KVLFZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this TV for about 3 Weeks now.  Here is a summary of what's good and what's not:Picture Quality: Great.  With some tweaking it really outshines anything in this price range.  In the unit i have there are hardly any bright spots on the corners (they are present but visible only in very dark scenes and are not much of a distraction).  I have used this TV to watch OTA channels, BluRay, ChromeCasted Webpages,  3D Videos and Movies (Streamed and from Camera).  PQ is as good as it can get for this price range.  Side note:  I use a small LED strip at the back to provide bias lighting. Trust, it does improve the viewing experience a lot.3D:  Really good.  Specially when compared to Panasonic Active.  Even though 3D content plays at 720p (per eye)  if you are at the proper distance(8-10 ft) you will barely notice any interlaced lines.  Passive glasses that come with this are light and provide a strain free viewing experience.  Some people complain of 3D content is dark, this can  be compensated to some extent by changing the settings.  I have made several short videos with a 3D camera  which have been shot in daylight. These look amazing on the 55 inch screen and make me go wow every time.  Do note that  POP out can be adjusted through 3D settings but is also dependent on how the original scene was shot.  For e.g in my setup i have to get someone do a punching action very close to my camera lense to have that pop out on the TV screen.  I have also viewed almost all of the  2 Min Previews of 3D movies available on VUDU. I can say this TV faithfully reproduces the 3d content it has been fed.SmartTV:  From a checklist p.o.v  LA7400 has all the major apps supported  but most of them have a sluggish interface (except for Vudu).  SmartTV apps are ready only after a good 2+ minutes from the time you power on.  Onscreen keyboard layout is not consistent among the applications (some have abcd others have qwerty). Another bummer is that TV settings cannot be accessed from all the apps.  For e.g. when running the vTuner radio app you cannot turn off the screen while in YouTube app you can.  Another feature that i found missing is the ability to pause an app (if not multitask).  If you are running and app and decide to go to home screen, it kills the app.  So whatever video/station you were watching is gone.  Add to that the annoying delay in launching these apps.  No wonder i have a ChromeCast and will be getting a Roku soon.  Coming to buffering, i rarely notice that even though i have a modest 12Mbps connection that i connect to using an Ethernet cable.Sound: TV has decent speakers but only good enough for Talk Shows and News.  I have since added a soundbar (LG NB4530B)  and use that 100% of time.Magic Remote:  This small remote is pretty good and fits nicely in my hand.  It may take couple of days to get used to it but is a nice toy to have.  Remote has very few buttons on it which give access to the functions we use 90% of the time: Vol,Channel,Settings,Scroll/Enter.  For everything else one has to move the remote in a wand like fashion.  For e.g if you move the pointer to bottom left of the screen a \"My APPs\"  button will pop. You can click on it  to access more features.  Overall the remotes is a nice fit with the UI of this TV.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Blaze TV app :(", "Author": "BRay", "ReviewID": "R3KCBT08Z79LVG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, I don't watch TV.  Everything I watch is a la carte streaming content with an occasional DVD rental.  I have 2 large LG monitors and a 42\" LG TV that I watch with a Roku--so you know I love LG.  Second, I only have wireless internet at the location I put this new one.So, obviously, the picture is great.  The sample 3D stuff that comes with it looks awesome though I haven't actually watched a 3D movie yet.Pretty much everything else about it is a disappointment.  Internet ready, watch your favorite content, Smart remote.Even after downloading the software update, shows streaming from Netflix, Amazon etc. constantly stop to reload.  I gave up on that after 2 days and bought another Roku.  All is great with the Roku, but the ad for this TV makes it sound as though you wouldn't need the Roku.I wrote to both LG and The Blaze asking about an app and both just said 'no' there isn't one.  That was pretty disappointing and would have necessitated the Roku in any case.  This TV did come with apps for Netflix, Amazon prime, and a ton of other junk--but see above for my experience with them.The browser that comes with the TV is very limited, don't think that you're going to watch anything streaming there.  And, when I went to the Drudge report it wouldn't load, giving me an insufficient memory error.  If it won't load that web site, I doubt that it will be useful for much--probably Microsoft had their hands in it.The voice recognition seems to only work for searches.  I'm not sure how useful that will turn out to be.  The Smart remote is slow to respond.  The 'universal' function of it is so slow that I'm resigned to using the DVD controller instead--and it doesn't work at all with the Roku.Overall, this TV has the operation of something that was rushed to market too soon.

After a bunch of research I decided to go the LED route since I was afraid of the Plasma's potential to \"burn in\" images since I'm an avid TV watcher and video game player (xbox).  Plus, I didn't want to go through that whole \"aging\" process with a Plasma.  I decided to buy an LG because my brother bought an LG tv 3 years ago and the picture on it was AMAZING even back then.The picture on this TV is AWESOME!  I calibrated my picture settings with what I found on avsforums and it looks great.  I would like to play with it more but there are so many options to tweak, I just said screw it lol.  The colors are so vibrant and with my settings, I saw no motion blur or any image \"weird-ness\".  I put on Star Wars Episode 2 on Blu Ray to see the image quality and it was incredible.  I could see things in the movie that I never really realized were there before due to the great picture image.I also played some xbox to test it out.  I played NCAA Football 14 and the graphics looked good on this TV.  It wasn't much of an increase in picture quality compared to my old HDTV but was slightly better which is what I expected - with video games you can't expect a huge increase in graphics or picture image when buying a new TV.  I bet the PS4 or xbox One will look amazing on these new TV's.  I didn't try any online play or try out any First Person Shooters so I do not know how these will perform but when playing NCAA I experienced NO input lag.  I was in Game mode and didn't try any other modes i.e. expert (custom) settings.3D Testing.  This is what I was most interested in when I received the TV but yet didn't buy this TV solely because it had 3D capabilities.  I do not have a 3D Blu Ray player so I cannot comment on that but I did use the 2D Conversion to 3D when playing Star Wars on Blu Ray and Xbox NCAA Football 14.  When using 2D - 3D watching Star Wars I didn't see much of a change compared to 2D.  It didn't stand out as much as a true 3D feed but you did see some 3D qualities.  Again, I expected this since converting a 2D image to 3D is difficult to do when not originally captured with a 3D camera.  BUT, when using 2D - 3D with the xbox I was pleasantly surprised!!!  When playing NCAA Football 14 the 3D image popped and added a really cool depth of field when lined up on the line of scrimmage.  Really felt like I was in the stadium playing a football game - it was really cool.  Plus, I felt like it gave me a better vision of the field and made passing and running the ball easier.The magic remote is cool but didn't fully link up with everything I hooked up to the TV.  For example, when syncing up my Blu Ray player to the magic remote all of the buttons worked like the play button, power button and so on except for the pause button.  I know this seems like not a big deal and it isn't but how can the remote sync up with all the other buttons EXCEPT the pause button?  It was just weird and I am not able to pause any Blu Ray lol.  Also, I couldn't sync my xbox with the remote.  Which makes sense but would be nice to have the remote recognize my xbox input so that I can seamlessly rotate between separate inputs i.e. xbox, Blu Ray player, stereo and others.  Also, I liked that after syncing up my magic remote to the cable I could still use my old remote if I wanted to with no issues to change channels and use the TV guide.The TV is a 47 inch but actually seems a little bit small surprisingly.  With the screen almost meeting the edge of the TV it tricks the eye into thinking its smaller than what it really is.  Its still a nice size TV but if this is your center piece for a large living room I would definitely go with a larger version of this TV.  I went with the 47 because it was at my price point but in hindsight I might have held out a little longer and waited for the larger version's price to go down and grabbed one of those.The stand is surprisingly sturdy but has small wheels on the bottom that helps rotate the TV for viewing but makes me a little nervous.  The wheels turn somewhat slowly which is good for stability but worries me that if someone were to hit my TV stand the TV could tip over or roll off the edge.  I don't think this would happen even if someone were to budge the TV stand but is something to consider.I used the internet app and messed with a few other apps - I'm not a big app guy for TV's.  People who do love TV apps and stream might have an issue with this TV.  I tried running a few youtube video's off the internet app and it was pretty slow even with my wireless signal strength at perfect/max.  I know this TV comes with a dual core processor but it is somewhat lacking.  I don't have netflix (this TV comes with a free one year subscription but it hasn't taken effect yet) but I am super curious how it will perform on this TV.  The processing speeds worry me that Netflix won't run efficiently but I don't have that answer yet.  I bet processing speeds would be much better if connected to a Ethernet cord.Lastly, I saw no light bleed or bum pixels.  Having only 3 HDMI inputs kinda stinks....four would have been better. Setup was really easy.All in all, I am pleased with this TV.  Would I buy it again....yes.  Would I go up in the next size? Yes.  Am I satisfied with LG's quality?

You should first begin with what it is you want or need out of a TV, then work your way up from there. I'm on the technology side of the consumer spectrum so there are things I knew i wanted in my next big purchase of a flat screen. Having been through just about all the major manufacturers products in multiple categories of devices I knew that LG was the best *in my opinion\" for the size i wanted and spec's i needed. This TV is a good size for a normal size living room, which is were i have it and the \"smart tv\" performs very well in conjunctions with my cable providers set top box. I even have an external hard drive that has close to a terabyte of movies on it and it was able to be hooked right up to the TV and it played my movies. I don't know which codec's it cant play but I've yet to see it not play anything i have.. navigation was a bit of a let down for me but thats only due to it being a tad slow at times when opening apps like hulu,netflix etc.. thats one of the things you'll have to get use to now that TV's are entering the arena of having processors to handle not only apps but external hdd's with other features like wifi crammed in as well. Aside from that the design is amazing, very thin.. the bezel is almost non existent  when viewing media, the stand which i use is nice and adds to the look or design in my opinion. The magic remote is just like a wii remote and is nice and responsive, if you've never owned a wii then its just and the name suggest, you point at the TV screen like a magic wand click for selections like you would a mouse with you're computer.the browser is decent nothing to write home about but light surfing is easily done with no major complaints, the voice navigation is quite nice, it pulls up anything from a move or tv show to searches with the internet browser. Sound quality is pretty good, I'm sure audiophiles might need a surround sound system or something paired with this but for the average person not yet into all of that it get prett loud and sound just fine. Picture quality is really good to me, the black levels are dark and the white levels are bright, there are setting to get the colors where you want them so it look good to me, but again I suggest before settling on any big item purchase you do a good amount of research and by that mean read \"reviews\" .. the good and the bad t get a full idea of the positive and negatives of the product, look at youtube videos so you can see it being operated, and if possible go into an actual store and sample it for yourself and ask question. otherwise this TV is a well built 60\" flat screen LED 1080p Smart tv by LG that performs very well.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "An elite buy", "Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "R28IWPK4DIVTLZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent probably 7 months researching the LG brand as a whole.  I initially started looking at the comparable Samsung model (UN60F8000).  Ultimately price won out for me.  I had a set budget to stay within and the LG just had more bang for the buck. I purchased the LG 60LA7400.  The magic remote takes some getting used to when utilizing the on-screen QWERTY keyboard, but not unlike using the XBox move or PS3/4 wireless functions.  I wanted to have as much connectivity via WiFi as possible between my PC, PS3, Sound system (PS the LG 3530A Sound Bar is a terrific compliment to this TV) and this model delivers very well.  The initial set up was a breeze to ensure proper connectivity via the internet.  Amazon Instant Movies look terrific, and is fairly intuitive to navigate through.  Same goes for the Netflix, HULU and VUDU apps.  This is my first 3D TV and was an upgrade from my 9 year old Toshiba REGZA 42\" 1080i LCD.  I have not used the 3D capabilities yet, but will update this review when I can.The only drawbacks are the stand for making this a set-top TV.  It's fairly unsturdy, so if you have young children, try to make sure this TV is up high enough so they cannot touch it or consider a wall mount.  I didn't mount this to a wall since I am single, and the building I live in has horsehair plaster instead of sheet rock for the walls.  I just didn't want to deal with a mounting disaster.  The mounting stand was the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, otherwise this is a solid purchase and worth the $1500-$2300 price tag.

Ands other than a 4K TV this set had the best picture that I have seen. The 3d is crazy cool my kids absolutely love it. The glasses are inexpensive should you need to buy more.  2D to 3d conversion works well also. I have read a few reviews that complain about quality of construction not sure how people complain about this 60\"tv that weighs only 50# or so.

For one, it looks absolutely stunning in person. The image on the product listing is a bit misleading though, as they show the picture going from edge to edge with pretty much 0 bezel. There is about a half inch of bezel on all sides, but it's definitely much less than most of its competitors. I upgraded from a 40\" Dynex LCD from back in the day that was basically a space heater with large, thick bezels. The stand on this TV looks great, but as some other reviews have said it feels just slightly less sturdy than what you'd expect for a TV in this price range. Either way it went on easily and I'm not worried about the TV falling off.This TV is a massive size increase for me, and I am LOVING it. Every time I turn it on I say to myself, \"self, you made the right call.\" The picture is vibrant and looks great with next-gen consoles such as my PS4, which supports Deep Color. I did set the color settings according to this page here: [...] -- I don't have a color meter, nor am I going to pay to have it calibrated. But it definitely looks fantastic. It did take me about 10-15 minutes to get the 20-point white balance set, due to having to scroll up and down and manually click the left/right arrows to change the values for each point. That's my only complaint there.It also has Game Mode! This removes almost all of the image processing to deliver the lowest input latency and lowest response time possible. It's not just about the time it takes for a pixel to change from one color to the next (response time) -- there is also a delay between pressing a button and seeing the associated action take place on TV (input lag). This means you will see people in-game and have more time to react. For those who do all of their console gaming on a TV, this is a big deal. It actually has an impressively low input latency for TVs in its class, clocking in at 39ms - [...] - though there are some faster ones out there that may not have as many features or as good of a picture. I definitely notice an improvement over my old TV.The reason I docked one star is due to black levels and viewing angles. I am used to IPS panels on phones and computer monitors that have incredible viewing angles and accurate blacks. However, due to the edge-lit LED technology in this TV, it won't reach a nice deep black like that of a plasma display (or an OLED/AMOLED display, for that matter). The color also washes out slightly when viewed from more than a 50-degree angle, but I view my TV from straight on, so that's not a problem for me. I do wish the blacks were darker, but all things considered, it's an acceptable hit on an otherwise great TV.I haven't even tested the speakers on the TV as all my sound goes through my receiver to my floorstanding speakers.---- Smart TV / remote control mini-review ----I don't intend to use most of the smart TV features on this TV because I have streamer boxes and gaming consoles that do all of my media for me. However, it is nice to get firmware updates for the TV over Ethernet and the Smart Menu looks pretty nice. I wish there was a faster way to get into picture settings than going through the Smart Menu, but it's not a big deal.The remote is actually kinda cool. I love how I can point it at the TV and move it around to click on what I want, not unlike the Wii controller. It makes it easier to select what I'm looking for rather than scrolling up and down with arrow keys on a remote. Sometimes I end up pressing the wrong button when I'm looking for menu (often hit the Mic key) but that's more of just having to train myself to know where to press. The scroll wheel is pretty neat too.---All in all, this TV is a bit spendy but it delivers a great picture, has gorgeous frame, and packs in a ton of smart features for those looking for an all-in-one setup. It isn't as popular as those by everyone's other favorite Korean manufacturer so it's harder to find more reviews or calibration settings for it, but that shouldn't stop you from buying it. It's one of the best in LG's lineup right now, and if you can find it on sale, I would not hesitate in recommending it.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV", "Author": "Robert  Greenberg", "ReviewID": "R1P9CW2OKVK1PB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent TV  Best value out there I looked at Samsung Sony etc and for the money nothing comes close Even the sound is better than I thought it would be", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING 3D!!!", "Author": "Rachel Closz", "ReviewID": "R3BKPBTPG5NAAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV will not disappoint. I was surprised that the 2D to 3D conversion worked so well on regular TV. I was expecting more fuzzy of an image but it did a good job of converting the image clearly. Though I probably wont use it much on regular TV it is a nice feature to have. I have not tried using it on a regular DVD yet but I'm sure it will look just as good if not better. But pop in a 3D blue ray and prepare to be amazed. I heard that the passive 3D TV's were not as good as shutter 3D TV's and that they lost 1/2 the resolution in 3D - that is completely FALSE. I watched Man of Steel 3D and it kept every bit of crystal clear blue ray quality and detail expected from a blue ray, I was amazed. The 3D is better than anything I have seen in the theaters. Plus, this TV has an amazing amount of adjustable 3D setting so you can tweak it to fit your preferences.The magic remote works great but takes a couple minutes to get use too.The TV speakers are pretty good but if you don't have a surround sound system like I do I would recommend getting a sound bar.I haven't watched much regular TV yet, as I just received the TV yesterday, but from what I have watched the picture looks pretty darn good.

I haven't yet done a pro level calibration, but just using my best judgement, the picture is fantastic!  I was not interested in 3D, but did buy a 3D disc just to see what it was like, and I must say that It was quite remarkable.  The built in speakers provided remarkably good sound for such a slim TV, not a substitute for an external system but very fine for casual TV viewing.  We use our external sound system for serious viewing of films.The TV was delivered by Pilot and I was surprised that the delivery people were not allowed to attached the base, which I thought was included with the white glove delivery.  The guy informed me that officially they weren't supposed to do it but if I asked them to they would attached the stand, which they did their policy notwithstanding.I had some question regarding operations and used the Amazon 30 day tech service and they were very helpful.  The voice recognition did not work on the magic remote so the Amazon tech gut connected me to an LG rep.  They were useless.  The Tech at LG told me that the voice recognition was suppose to work from pressing the mic button on the remote.  I know that this was BS so I call the Amazon tech people again.  This time they asked me to turn the set off, unplug it, plug it back in and press the power on button on the right side of the TV for 30 seconds to perform a static discharge.  This solved the problem.  Yesterday, we had a bad electrical storm and the remote wasn't working constantly so I repeated the above procedure and it cleared the problem.  So if you are having glitchy remote performance, you might want to try it.This brings us to the magic remote. I hate it!  The pointer is slow to become active, and becomes inactive before you select the function and make the adjustment you want.  You have to shake the remote to reactive it.  It is just to difficult to make simple changes because of the menu within menus approach.For example, to switch from the TV internal speakers to your external sound system, you have to press the magic button them move the pointer to settings, then move the pointer to sound, then repeatedly press the down arrow to get to the sound output choice then make your selection and then click two more time to get out of the menu system. This is also the procedure to change aspect ratio and turning on captions we use a lot in our house.  I really think that ofter used features should have  a dedicated buttons.  There is a quick settings menu, but you  still have to click and click and click, so it is only marginally better.To remedy some of these problems, I just ordered a standard remote LG # AKB73756506.I am not impressed with the voice recognition either, because it is slower to perform a function then just using the remote. If i use the voice recognition feature to change channels for example, and there are sub-channels  it always go to the secondary channel.  So, if you tell it to got to channel 12 it goes to channel 12.2.  The default should be the main channel not a secondary one. Same thing on my cable box, If you tell it to go to MSNBC, It really doesn't know what to do and brings a list of stations for you to choose from.  Not as convenient as just using the cable remote to enter in the channel number.Also, the thing that is the most inconvenient about the remote is switching between input devices.  Again you have to press a button on the remote which brings up a box, now you have to move the pointer to the device you want and press to select, then press another icon to exit out.  I was hoping that the voice recognition system would work to make this easier.  For example, it would be great if you could say  \"Go to TV\" or \"Go To Cable\", but when try to do this , I get a message saying \" This feature is not yet available\"  Seems that this would be the most obvious feature to have implemented for the voice recognition system.Another note. sound output is only through optical out, so if you like me, want to feed the audio to a 2 channel sound system, you will need an optical to analog audio D/A converter and select PCM audio from the sound menu. Also, it would have been easier to have the internal speakers and the audio out active at the same time since you can always turn down the volume on the TV speakers.  This would eliminate the need to switch from internal to external speakers.Five stars for the TV, sound and 3D performance, two stars for the remote.  Hopefully future software updates might fix some of the problems.

Gripping 3D, Clear screen, etc. I can't complain about that. What I don't like are the smart TV menu functions. The biggest problem I've had is that there is only one HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel). That means that if you want to play sound into a home theater setup with in-wall speakers using an AV Receiver you will have problems. First, to get ARC to work, you have to enable Simplink, which is intended to control other LG components. If you don't have any other LG components, then maybe you are in luck. If you do, the problem is that with Simplink enabled, the other LG component insists on running, which is great if that is what you wanted to watch or listen to. If you turn off Simplink, then ARC is disabled.  That means that the TV will only play through the TV speakers. That may be OK if you have a small room, but if you have a 5.1 or 7.1 system, it is sort of a waste. I jury-rigged my LG Bluray so it has an electrical switch that turns if completely off. That allows the Simplink to run, not trigger the Bluray player, and still allow the ARC channel to run. Alternatives would be to run an optical cable from the TV to the Receiver (but I've not tried that, so no guarantee), to replace any LG components with non-LG components, or to not use the smart TV menu or functions and only run functions off a Bluray player or something like a ROKU.

Lo' and behold, LG offers Direct-Lit LED with Local Dimming in only its 60\" model of the LA7400. Wow, it makes a huge difference!Now I'll be honest, I was disappointed that it wasn't as sleek and sexy as the Edge-Lit. It's thicker because of the Direct-Lit LED panel and needs a thicker bezel, but none of that matters because the picture quality is so beautiful! I kind of like the black thin bezel now because it doesn't distract from the picture, and I feel it's much sturdier than it's anorexic model cousin.I've had this TV for over three months now, and my family still says \"Wow\" when we're watching HD.

Slim with a metal frame. Has a simple, industrial look. However, no part of the design feels or looks cheap. A nice added feature is the small bezel. The bezel is about 1/2 inch around the screen. The stand also adds a nice aspect to the TV with its curved design. Plus, it has tiny wheels that allows for easy placement adjustments.Picture Quality:The 240Hz can be the best and the worst feature of this TV. It performs well on movies and gaming. However, can lag on certain TV shows, becoming more apparent on the commercials, than the actual show itself. However, I believe that this may have more to do with our cable provider than the TV itself.3D:The 3D feature is brilliant. As expected, with a 3D source the TV performs wonderfully. A nice feature is the 2D to 3D conversion. So, if you are wanting to experience 3D but do not have a 3D source at the moment, you can convert a traditional 2D movie to 3D on the fly. But note, that since you are converting from 2D to 3D, the picture or 3D quality is not going to be exactly the same as something that was natively 3D to begin with.Smart TV functions:It is nice to be able to use a full web browser on the TV. While the browser is adequate, streaming from sites, such as Crunchyroll, can be a pain. Whether it is lag or waiting on the site itself, using the browser in place of an app is not always a great experience.The TV comes preloaded with Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Crackle to name a few. Currently, the app selection is a little on the low side. With apps such as Amazon Instant Video and Crunchyroll not having native support at this time. Therefore, before getting rid of your external player (such as Roku), make sure that the apps you currently use are available on this tv / LG app store.The lack of apps and still needing to keep a Roku at this time is really not a huge deal, since this TV supports the usage of Plex Media Server (From smart menu go to Video - Linked Device). We currently use Plex Media Server for various reasons, so having this ability was a wonderful addition and surprise.LG Magic Remote:The Magic Remote is a nice addition to the TV, but there are some down sides to it.

After using my Logitech remotes for so long I am used to lots-o-buttons. But this one only has 14 buttons and a wheel. Everything else you need is on the screen and you select it with a cursor that move as you point your cursor at it.Bad: As neat as this is, I can imagine this would be difficult to use for some elderly or disabled people.Ugly: Trying to use the remote first thing in the morning or when you are sick.Good: 3D! This is the first time I have seen the current generation of 3D on TV. I have never been able to \"see\" previous 3D or those \"Magic Eye\" pictures, but this I can see and without a slitting headache.Bad: The quality of the 3D is totally dependent on the show or movie. I don't have anyway of playing 3D movies yet, but there are several trailers for them on the TV's 3D site. The Nightmare Before Christmas was incredible! If they all were like this one, I would have bought a 3D DVD player that day, but they are not. Most don't really seem to have any \"3D\" in them.Ugly: Jack Skellingtion in your face!Good: Voice Command is neat! I was watching Batman Begins on my other TV as I was unpacking this one, so  my first voice command was \"Find Batman!\" And it did! You can also use this for internet searches, which is far faster than trying to type with your remote.Bad: Mind Sun Tan!

It was extremely easy to set-up the remote and wireless internet (just enter the router password and voila! connection).  The picture quality is unsurpassed and the voice command is really cool. You can watch one channel, but tell the TV \"change to AMC when The Walking Dead is on\" that way you don't miss the first 10 minutes of because you didn't notice the time or got distracted by re-runs of SVU.One other note, I have a southern accent and when I said \"guide\" into the voice command, it thought I said \"Die\" -the TV icon (a cartoon lady) poped up at the bottom of the screen and said \"I'm sorry, are you bored? let me suggest something to watch\" AMAZING!It is also really cool to be able to use voice command and the internet.  My TV is mounted so that I can see it from the kitchen so now I can cook along with youtube recipes on the big screen.I think I'm enjoying this way more than I should be, and I haven't even discovered all of its features yet. The simplicity of use and clarity of picture inspired to write a poem :-)How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love your 3D picture depth and the 55 inch bevel-less 1080p cinema screenYour soul, like mine is directly connected to the internet andWe can be at one with cyberspace by simply whispering \"open Google\".I love thee to the level of everyday's most quiet need,I love thee by the light of your dazzling big screen.I love thee freely, as husbands strive to turn thee to the sports channel;I love thee purely, as the quality of your picture and the simplicity of your set up.I love thee with a passion put to useAs you hang upon my wall and cook with meScrumptious recipes found on Youtube - with the utterance \"open Youtube - search Vindaloo recipe\"I love thee with the pure unadulterated love that one can only have for anew*fangled electronic deviceMy love for thy Magic Remote is rivaled only by the simplicity of which \"Set-up\" was achievedI love thee for bringing together my premium TV selections of Hulu and Netflix...But Alas, I have not discovered if you offer me easy access to the content of Amazon Prime.

In this regard I can only say good things about this TV.But regarding the \"smart\" aspect of this TV I'm not happy at all. The TV connectivity to your home network is almost useless, as accessing your files is so slow that you give up. Browsing through files is slow an painful.In the SMART world I would say that this is a very beginners level TV. Some of the built-in apps crashes - luckily the power button always work and you can restart!!!I was about to return it. If it was small as a radio I would return it, but I'm keeping it as the picture quality is really good (including the 3D, although 2D>3D is useless).The Internet side of the TV will be used as an extra: it works but needs to evolve in the interaction aspect.The so called \"Magic Remote\" is a good idea, but missing buttons to change basic things like Aspect Ratio, Picture Size, Inputs, Sound Output, is really, really a drawback. I recommend to buy the model with the other remote with keyboard.Some will say that it has voice recognition. Yes it does, but only works to go search on the web. If you are filling a field in a application, the voice recognition will close that window and open the browser to search for what you said. It's not a voice-to-text system, but a search tool.I prefer to control the TV with my Smartphone.For sound I have the  Logitech z906 THX Certified Home Theatre connected to the TV via optical cable. Really great!Don't need to go to the cinema any more.3D is passive and it's like in the Theatre. Awesome!Bellow you can find some of my complains about this TV. But don't forget: you will not find any picture as good as this one!!! And the 55 size is great but I would recommend to get bigger: you will feel inside the scenes. Cinema is great on this TV.29JULY13: I have this SmartTV for 2 days. It's smart to connect to your WiFi network, your PC or even Phone, but it's not that really smart when it comes to details: when the input is TV I would like the sound to be by default by using the TV speakers; when the input is the Blu-ray, I would like to sound to be via Digital Out.The Magic Remote is good, but to change things as normal as aspect ratio you need to hit 5-6 clicks. If you have a regular remote you would have a dedicated button to change the inputs, or aspect ratios, etc. To change anything in the TV you basically stop to watch what you were watching because a new screen pop-up for you to annoyingly navigate under menus and windows. Welcome to the stupid future of endless menus and more clicks to do simple tasks that you would do in less than a second 20 years ago, but now with a \"magic\" remote and android screens takes you several windows and clicks.The digital output doesn't accept DTS, therefore I had to set the TV to use the very poor built-in speakers and had to connect my players directly to my speaker system. I was expecting that this TV would be my \"new hub\" of my home entertainment, as announced by LG.The good part: for $1400 it's good enough.02 AUG13: The WiFi streaming is really good: it can play youtube videos right from my cellphone with no streaming problems (the same video in my cellphone would stop for streaming, but in the TV, never stops) and the quality of the picture of the videos from the net it's amazing, even for this big screen.There is no auto-screen saver, so when you pause a DVD the screen will be on forever with the same pic.This TV is not only for watching TV, it is also a media hub. When playing music from the web, the display could have a screen saver to even could be turned off to save energy, as I only want the sound and not the picture.When using Pandora, for instance, you cannot change ANY settings without exit the application!!!! First you need to close the application, only then the \"smart\" or the \"Q.MENU\" buttons work!When I turn on a new device, why the \"smart\" TV asks if I want to change the input? Of course I want to change the input; that's the reason of turning  a new device on, to interact with the TV. Couldn't LG add an option like: \"Always remember this action for this input\" or something similar?Not very SMART this TV :(ALMOST CONSIDERING RETURN IT AND BUY A SONY SMART TV :(5AGO13: today I tried connect the TV to one PC using the SMARTSHARE and I'm able to watch movies that I have in my computer. That's great, BUT while playing VOB files the \"smart\" TV there is NO button in the magic remote where you can change the \"aspect ratio\". \"Quick menu\" will only allow you to play with \"picture size\" and even \"Full\" mode won't expand the picture to all the screen. If you use the \"Smart menu\" button you will exit the movie and the SmartShare. Is this a smart TV?To change the \"aspect ratio\" you need to exit the SMARTSHARE and go then to \"Smart\" menu and then choose \"Quick menu\" and only there you have \"aspect ratio\"!!!! Incredible how a \"smart\" TV is that stupid.There is a \"cinema zoom\" option but is not accessible while the picture for the network video is there!Tried 16:9, Zoom, Cinema mode but  the movie is not fitting the entire screen and the picture is distorted!Unless you don't mind to watch circles as ovals, or squares as rectangles, this little-\"smart\" TV is what you need.Does LG personnel uses these TVs before putting them in the Market?!?After several attempts, the video from my home network is also not usable, as I can't stand distorted pictures, is this not-\"smart\" TV! :(", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing display Life's good", "Author": "jaymez125", "ReviewID": "R3RG1HIPITO1J0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first HD SMART tv and I cannot be happier about it.

You already have streaming video from your other devices, right?  And photo display, and all that.  In fact, I don't use those on the TV because then the sound wouldn't go into my home theater, which is the real bugaboo about on-TV apps, they're only useful if you're limiting your audio use to the bare-bones speakers built into the TV instead of a real surround sound system.  So all in all, it's no big deal that the apps are kind of clunky, nor does it matter much that the remote has all this fancy voice-activated, mouse-wand stuff, since you won't use any of that anyway.The picture quality is fantastic.  That's what you want from a TV, right?  As with most, the settings from the factory are terrible, giving this oddly jerky, over-bright feel that had me worried; but once you find a good guide for calibrations the picture quality improves immensely.It's also super-thin and, for its size, surprisingly light, making wall-mounting a fairly easy job with a good mount.3D looks good and is even viable at an angle, though you'll want to be nearer the center of the field of view for the best effect.  Note that 3D on a TV doesn't live up to 3D at the movies; you'll notice the frame rate being halved, giving it a sort of \"cheap videotape\" feel (at least in the movement, though the picture remains sharp and lovely).

I've calibrated and optimized the settings on ISF expert 1 (20pt white setting) but the picture quality still doesn't come close to the old LH90. The 3D setting is a nice feature but my family has only used it once and the kids (who love 3D movies at the theater) just wanted to watch the movie in 2D, so we switched out the blu-ray and turned off 3D (they also weren't impressed with the 2D to 3D up-convert).  I've used the smart features quite a bit yet they aren't any more impressive than using netflix or amazon prime on the xbox or ps3, the only thing that I truly like is the ability to cast (a la chromecast) from my iPhone directly to the TV.In retrospect I should have spent more for the 8600 or went with a samsung or panasonic. happy hunting!", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome tv", "Author": "John M Sisco", "ReviewID": "R2TKYBLE1QDTN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read a lot of reviews on this tv & some were not very good, I am here to say that this is a great tv.

Pretty sweet looking bezel all the way around. However, turning it on... the default TV settings are garbage. 1st thing I did was turn off all the soap opera effects and auto bright/dim features that really annoy the living heck out of me! Still cannot 100% get rid of the dim/brightness thing and I seriously debated returning the TV just for that reason alone. I just want to see the natural picture, how the director intended the content to be displayed. Don't amp up all this artificial crap that looks fake, it's horrible LG! It also doesn't demonstrate a very good picture with non HD content. If it's HD, or 3D this TV shines, especially the 3D holy cow it's amazing! I used to install TV's for a living and this is my favorite aesthetic panel on the market, it's also the best 3D I think I've seen on a flat LED type panel. The Internet is downright garbage. Initially I couldn't even get main services like Netflix and Pandora to work, and it's very cumbersome. Also, when you 1st turn the unit on, don't expect to use the Internet for at least a few minutes. This is with a hard line connection folks, at 40megs DL. My $99 tablet turns circles over this thing, I mean seriously the TV is not capable of any speed whatsoever. Surfing on the browser is like using dial-up, it's not usable or practical at all. It also needs a serious set of updates, each requiring a restart and not telling you it needs another update. Very disappointed with that. We bought a Roku unit and that takes care of our Internet features, since the TV couldn't. The remote works like the Wii, I kinda like it but you have to shake the thing a million miles an hour to wake it up, and it times out too quickly. Ok so there's a setting to change that right? WRONG! It's stuck on the poor setting. Also crappy because you have to use it to change sources, etc. they didn't provide enough hard key buttons, which also makes it almost unusable. I got a universal remote since again the TV could not do its job. See the pattern here? It misses the boat on several key items. Disappointed with you LG!!! I've had a Zenith plasma forever (LG parts), it still kicks butt in our bedroom and I've always been a fan of LG appliances, but I would not recommend this TV. Also has poor light glare, light prism/rainbow effect and cannot watch during the day since we currently don't have blinds! I think it's due to the extra layer for the 3D, so that's a drawback to 3D not the TV itself.The 240 Hz is a joke. Doesn't do anything for me, I'd rather have a 120 Hz since this isn't a true 240 (didn't realize that til after I bought it - false advertising??)I'd probably recommend Samsung, check out the 8000 or 9000 series!", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lg", "Author": "Liz", "ReviewID": "R249LB3JHF8YEM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Luv it.

Golf, particularly can be horrible to watch as a panning picture will score dark smudges and blotches throughout the entire screen.  Soccer can also show the same thing.  Green backgrounds on both sports show up very obviously with these clearly dirty black splotches and smears. You may also see vertical bands in the picture in these scenes.

Normal viewing excluding golf and soccer is beautiful but I am sure when football season starts , I will notice dirty screen effect in the green background.For me, this tv I would not buy again due to this dirty screen effect. It  can ruin watching sports, not all but most. This is a problem you can google and find out more. LG has had problems with some recent panels.  Hopefully, this one is a fluke lemon.

There are a lot of things to like about this TV. Design is sleek, picture quality is overall superior (especially 3D of animated movies), TV stand swivels to left and right.However, there are a few things I do not like. For one, the magic remote is more annoying than anything else. If you want to talk to someone, go to the Psychiatrist, and don't talk to your TV remote. Biggest flaw is that it does not have a button designated to change the input channel. Can be very annoying.Sound is OK if TV is on the stand, but rather disappointing if you hang this TV on the wall. Also, I share the view of others that most of the apps and the overall smart feature of the TV do not do much for me. Sure, I can watch Amazon on demand, but my TiVo and PS3 do that, too, anyway.The picture really only is very good if you apply the expert settings published in another review.

Entering SmartTV mode often times just fails and hangs up with the swirling \"working\" icon3.) ONE OF THE MOST ANNOYING ASPECTS: Your kids are sleeping and the last time your TV was on they were watching Dora at a relatively high volume during the day. That evening you turn on your TV and WHAM volume set same high level on same channel. Which makes sense...BUT You need to wait for the TV to finish booting or initializing or whatever it has to do in it's start-up sequence BEFORE you can turn down the volume, leaving your TV to blast for sometimes over 45 seconds while the TV figures itself out. Unbelievably bad design here.4.) The Skype app ONLY works with 1 camera that is never in stock and incompatible with every other webcam built for Skype on TV's5.) You will be required to make several adjustments to the TruMotion settings to get around the default \"soap opera\" effect on movies.6.) Other LG devices allow integration with your smartphone for transmitting audio, this TV does not and the need to add it as a feature.These are not \"extreme user\" quips, these are common features that any user of this TV will encounter.Other than that the picture is beautiful and the physical design is slick. This tells me that at least the engineers with an \"E\" are doing good work. But all the programmatic issues come down to very poor quality control and management of the SmartTV features.

I could be the source, however playback on the Panasonic was always smooth.

So, this is all new to me.The set, as you might guess is large and heavy.  You will be required to be home to receive it.  CEVA Logistics is used in LA.  I got a phone message from them.  I called back and left them my number, as requested.  After four hours, I did not receive a return call and called again.  After four more calls, I got a live person!  It turns out that they deliver on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. (so you potentially will be waiting at home all day).  They arrived at 8:30 a.m. and the delivery guys were very polite and delivered the boxed TV set upstairs. Couldn't have been better.The box is actually two parts.  So cut the straps and lift the outer box up and the TV is set in a the bottom box.  The TV is very well packed.  The stand for the TV is probably still in the part of the box you just took off. (Or the piece of styrofoam on the top of the set.  There will be a bag with the remote, power chord, instructions and the screws for the base.The base to the TV connects very easily to the set and you just need to screw in the four screws provided and it is ready to set on its stand.  Just plug the power chord in the set and outlet and you are ready to go.  Connect the cable and any devices you want in the back.Put batteries into the remote and turn it on.  This is the MAGIC remote.  This does not look like your standard remote because it is not.  This is more like a super mouse.  You shake it and a pointer appears on your screen.  Just move the remote to control the pointer and follow the set-up instructions.  If you want to use your wifi have your password handy.  Total set-up time is about 30 minutes.As for the picture quality, with the initial exception below, the quality is excellent not much more to talk about here.This one comes with the \"Magic\" remote which is a small remote with only a few options.  This is because it is more of a hybrid remote.  By that I mean it is half remote and half mouse.  You shake it back and forth and a pointer appears on the screen.  This means that most of the normal remote functions can be accessed on screen.  This is especially helpful when using the onscreen keyboard.  You just point and click.  The remote has direct access to the Smart TV menu, access menu and of course, the on/off, channels and volume.Here are a few helpful hints:1. The TV is set on Eco.  After a few minutes the screen will start to fade.  So turn this setting to standard and your picture will stay alive.2. I was having problems with the older pictures (pre 50's) looking like they were filmed on video instead of film.  It appears that it is the standard settings.  Go to picture settings and move each one to the middle.  Then adjust to the picture quality that you like.  When doing this, wait about 30 seconds and the picture will adjust to the new setting.  This way you can readjust.3. This comes with 4 sets of 3-D glasses but they do not fold up.  Save your 3-D glasses from the movie theaters because they work fine and they do fold up for easy storage.  Also note that you need to be as far away from the screen as diagonal width.  And finally, the closer to center of the TV the better the effect (this is also true at movie theaters.)4. You need to choose the picture aspect ratio either 1.33 standard aspect ratio, 1.65 widescreen aspect ratio or use aspect ratio from device.  If you select 1.33 then this is like the old TVs.  Widescreen programs will be shown in letterbox - i.e. you will be using a smaller portion of your screen because of the bands on the left and right to make it 1.33 and the letterbox bands on the top and bottom.  If you use the 1.65 widescreen, standard pictures will be stretched out to fit the full screen.  So I recommend the choose by device option.Here is why I say it's not user friendly.1. You really cannot use more than one DVD player without getting a HDMI conversion kit.2. With my old TV, I can move from one attached device to another with just a push of the button.  This one you have to go to apps either at the bottom corner of the TV or using the button on the remote, then click on inputs and then the device you want.3. I set the aspect ratio to be defined by the picture but everyting was showing 1.33.  So when I was watching someting in letterbox, instead of it expanding the picture, it would just show it in 1.33 with the bands on top and bottom.  I found out that if choose Zoom for the aspect ratio, it will expand the picture to the full screen.  The issue is when you are watching a regular 1.33 show, it expands it out and cuts off the top and bottom!.  So you have to switch it back to regular view.  The Select by Source aspect ratio should do this by itself.Now that I have been using it a while, I still love the set overall but have found a few things that need improvement:1. I was using the internet feature because I wanted to watch a tennis match on ESPN.com.  I input the site and selected the match.  It never uploaded.  I did this on two different occasions and got the same result.  I am guessing that the TV doesn't have enough memory to play shows from the internet websites.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG 60 inch LED TV", "Author": "Levy Dixon", "ReviewID": "R21AJDW0C73SCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture, clear sound,enternet works fast, and it has 3-D also. the price was very good.

Like I said, there were no flashlighting issues right after unboxing; however, after a couple of days after I hung up the TV on the wall (using the Framsta wall system from Ikea with the Ikea TV hanging bracket), I started seeing the same flashlighting issue only on the bottom right corner (had both left and right bottom corner on the first one).  Thus, my conclusion is that hanging this TV on the wall will create some stress on the panel to where it may bleed some light at the bottom edges.  You may have different results if you're using another way to hang on the wall.  I did not try switching back to the stand to see if the flashlighting goes away since the reason I got the Ikea Framsta wall unit was to hang my TV on a wall; however, since I did not see the issue until a couple of days later, I assume that one should not see this issue if using the stand.  I have reduced my rating to 4 stars due to this issue; however, I am keeping the TV since I love everything else about this TV.  Again, only see the flashlighting when there is a letter box at the bottom or a really dark screen. Looks fine when the entire picture consumes the full screen.  BTW, the 47LM8600 that I have is on the stand and seeing no issues.Update 12/5/13: Well, I received the replacement TV today, and looks like my first one was defective since NO flashlighting on the replacement.  Everything works great now, so upgrading to 5 stars.  Again, Amazon did a great job of taking care of this customer.  Not sure if the date of manufacturing made a difference, but the original was made in October 2013 while the replacement was made in June 2013.  Something must have happened to the first one after the final quality check at the factory up to the delivery to my house.  Replacement is now safely static in one place with no flash lights at any of the corners.  If things change over time, then I will provide updates.  BTW, I also bought the 47LM8600 about a year and a half ago, and it is still providing me with just as beautiful picture as day one, so hoping to see the same with this one.I received this TV and am in the process of exchanging for another since the one I received had serious flash light issues on both bottom corners.  I thought that I could get by even though very noticeable on a black screen / letterbox borders, but when watching a regular video streaming from Netflix / TV show, and a person's dark clothing or a dark scene passed by the bottom corners, I would see those darks wash out which is totally unacceptable.  When my wife, who could care less about PQ, also notices something like this, then it is most definitely an issue.  I tried to play with the brightness, contrast, local dimming, Picture Wizard, and even a little voodoo dance but to no avail.  Also, I tested with my Xbox thinking that different input devices may affect.  Not so.  BTW, all my observations above were not even in a totally dark room; all this was observed at night but with all the ceiling lights on in my family room which is fairly bright.  Turning off the lights just made everything jump out of the screen more - not the 3D I had in mind for this TV.Everything else about the TV (overall PQ, magic remote, apps, etc.) are great, but the fact that the flashlighting was so severe on the one I received is justification for the 3 stars.  If it wasn't for this issue, then I would have given 5 stars.  We'll see how the replacement unit turns out, and I will update my rating and experience.Not so hot with these edge-lit LCDs.  Not sure if a quality or design issue on LG's part, but I am sure a lot can happen to a large [flexible] display like this one from manufacturing all the way to delivery to customer to where any stress or bend in the glass can create uniformity or edge misalignment issues.  If the next one does not work out, then will need to consider getting a plasma set or an LED set with full / direct LED array.Amazon was great in providing the swap which goes to show that for any large item, internet purchases like this one, Amazon is the only way to go.  They even said that if the replacement set did not work out, then they would accept return / refund and provide a $100.00 discount for another TV purchase as compensation for the inconvenience.  All good, but I am hoping that the replacement set will be OK since I really like everything else about this TV.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Read reviews on Smart TV's in general -- They say it all", "Author": "RO", "ReviewID": "R1C5TK4MAYHX5L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "TV is really nice - Excellent picture, thin, light Low power consumption and really good 3d-- But the 'Smart Functions' are pretty dumb.At first they were fun to play with but that faded quickly.

J. Marshall", "ReviewID": "R3OYBEVN8FNA73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The last time I bought a big TV, Samsung and Sony had a shared production facility and I ended up comparing two TVs that had exactly the same panel yet looked markedly different in terms of picture. The reason, as I learned, is that there's a whole lot of value added - or not - by the software and the processing. And there's the rub. A TV can have a high refresh rate but not use it to great effect. It can be edge-lit but still have trouble directing that lighting and keeping up with where the picture needs to be lightened or darkened. In the final analysis it's how good the picture looks that matters.LG have done an outstanding job here. Anyone that has seen one of these sets will get why CNET and other reviewers compare it to TVs costing thousands more. The closest competition in my view is from Samsung, whose latest top-of-the-line models are superb. It's a very close call, but if you look carefully, the LG edges it out - particularly in how it renders skin tones. It's a more realistic look while still having a vivid picture that is rich in color but not over saturated. It's tough to pull that off, but this set does. Yet, despite being better, it costs a lot less.For me, the other features are icing on the cake. For example, we en-smarten our TVs with Apple TVs, so a lot of the Smart TV features are duplication for us. Similarly, 3D is a feature I only see us digging out the glasses for once in a while, but it is impressive. The remote control is very nice; simple, fun to use, and effective - especially when you let it control other devices such as your cable box. And I'm giving the stand top-marks for understated elegance. No boring black plastic here - the dark-grey metallic look is futuristic while managing to look great even when paired with more traditional furniture.I do wish LG would allow more customization (especially removal) of the Smart TV features. For example, I have no idea why I need 4 icons on the menu bar that simply go to go to different folders in the same Smart Share app, or why I have to see icons for services I don't want to subscribe to. I also don't like that LG don't sell their accessories directly or make more of an effort to ensure they are available elsewhere. For example, the Skype camera is only listed by a couple of online retailers for multiple times the price LG have listed. After a month, it's still backordered for me to get a somewhat reasonable price. LG support pointed me in the direction of their parts distributor who couldn't help. That needs fixed.Conclusion: A superb TV with outstanding picture quality. To live with this set is to love it. It gives us \"wow!\" moments every day. A great buy.UPDATE: Two models of Skype camera are available from LG as of Feb. 2014. The AN VC-400 and AN VC-500 (which has a higher resolution). This TV works with either. If you want to make completely sure, go to Settings on the TV and make sure it has the latest software update. After that, try to launch the Skype application and you'll see a message telling you what camera(s) you can use. Still loving this TV very much. Doing more voice searches than I thought I would (you can search the web, TV guide, etc that way) and also using the web browser when multiple people want to see something. The free LG iPhone / iPad app comes in handy (also available for Android).", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice for the price", "Author": "MusicBuff", "ReviewID": "R392PV9FSP2Z79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simple to setup, great picture, love the magic remote and direct wifi connections.

This may not seem like a big deal, but when your wife says you can't get anything \"bigger\" this is the only way to get more screen! The bezel is so thin it almost disappears when you see the bright, vibrant, crystal-clear picture.We have a universal remote to avoid the clutter, but it doesn't do the pointer like the included magic remote. This was disappointing at first until I realized how useful the Wii-like remote is for using the Smart-TV and internet functions. The button layout is very well thought-out, allowing immediate access to the most frequently used functions: Arrows, Power, Smart-TV, Back and Microphone. (for voice recognition when doing searches) Then, as if to top it with whipped cream AND a cherry, there's a scroll wheel/select button in the middle that works perfectly. The voice recognition works well and is MUCH easier than trying to point-and-click with the on-screen keyboard. My only complaint, like some other reviewers, is that the arrow disappears too quickly and you really REALLY have to shake the remote to get it to come back. I've actually tweaked my wrist doing this!I haven't tried installing any Apps, but the Smart-TV (NetFlix, YouTube) and internet work very well. Mostly because of the well designed remote, but also because the on screen layout is intuitive. I'm still kicking myself for not getting Smart-TV functionality sooner!Haven't tried the 3D yet, so no comment there.We've enjoyed several Packer and Badger games on this TV and happily report no noticeable ghosting or trails... not even when Randall Cobb or Jordy Nelson blow past defenders on their way down field. Our previous TV was also 240 Hz, so we expected this, but if you're used to a 60 Hz, 120 Hz LCD or worse, a Plasma, you will delight with how clear fast sports action is on this TV.I never had an issue with black levels on our past LCD TV, so I can't really comment on \"better\" black levels with the LED TV.

Only problem is if you are setting it up to control your set-top box make sure that the remote has clear view of the box itself otherwise it will not be able to control the features.  I tried using one of those IR extenders that plug into the back of the set-top box and allow you to put the little IR receiver tag anywhere else and it still doesn't work unless the remote has a clear path to the front of the actual set-top box....so keep that in mind in case you have your entertainment center setup with a hidden set-top box.I watched some of the free content they have for 3D and I was extremely pleased.

Last year, I bought an LG Cinema Screen 55LM7600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses, which is a great TV.

The only positive thing that I got out of this purchase is the fact that it was delivered at a respectable time, which is a good being that I wasted my whole day trying to get digital cable to work with this \"Smart\" TV.I spent all day bouncing from one vendor tech support to the next troubleshooting how to get this \"Smart\" TV to receive cable signal from the box, which worked fine on my old \"Non-Smart\" TV. A whole day gone and no success. What kills me the most is that this tv can do all these fancy things except for its most basic function... Watch television!It's really a no brainer, the cable box (TiVo receiver) connects to \"Smart\" tv via HDMI, that should work... Except it doesn't and both TiVo and LG are saying I need to purchase an Audio/Video breakout cable.

But the one I got from Amazon appeared to be inferior in picture and/or screen quality. I also discovered that that viewing angle was much dimmer after about 20 degrees from straight-on. Unenjoyably dim. Both of these seemed totally different from the wide angle, clean screen I saw at the store. My screen seemed to have a film or dirt or just less-bright pixels all along both sides and across the bottom, with less noticeable but entirely distracting \"smears\" extending up into the middle on very bright, even scenes like golf. The bottom corners were especially dark. I also noticed, despite many hours of setting adjustment attempts, that colors tended to bleed over, like a golf ball flying across a blue sky appeared to have blue edges, or across a fairway to have green edges. I also discovered that, with a normal ir universal remote, there is no way to conveniently switch inputs, and the \"Magic\" Remote does not operate my DirecTV or Roku devices with any real convenience. To operate other devices, you have to point the Magic Remote at the (incomplete) on-screen virtual remote for that device and click the correct on-screen button, which can be much more time-consuming and less accurate than simply pushing a button on a remote. Anyway, I have to carry two remotes around to get convenient functionality, which doesn't work for me, and I feel was very thoughtless, not to include at least input cycling via ir.  Another minor con was a good amount of motion jitter on flying golf balls, etc., which is not there on my new lg plasma.The sound on the TV was excellent, with many settings (but no treble or bass, strangely) including an auto-content detector that seemed to work very well. We enjoyed AXS concerts on this TV; they really showcase its pros and hide its cons.The unit did have excellent connections with 3 hdmis and 3 usbs, and the smart functions worked very well. This was the only unit I've found that actually plays embedded videos on every website I tried, even p**n, and the remote made it easy to navigate the web. Even the voice-search worked amazingly well, and filled in web addresses too. I had no trouble voice-searching for Pizza hut, baseball scores, etc. Very cool. Too bad about the cons. Oh, and LG doesn't have Amazon Video available on their 2013's which is weird, and also a major con, as I use that a lot.This was my third & last attempt to buy a TV from Amazon. I've become convinced, probably incorrectly, that the units they receive to ship out are not the same quality as the ones makers send to the local store. I went to a local store and got a 2013 50\" lg dumb pn6500 plasma for $600-ish, because they don't seem to have the plasmas as smart or with lots of inputs, but they do have dazzling pq with none of the above issues, great viewing angle, and amazing sound. To this I'm adding (from Amazon) G-Box Midnight MX2 Android 4.2 Jelly Bean Dual Core XBMC Streaming Mini HTPC TV Box Player, for even better internet than the LA7400 offers, and HDMI switch, 5 in, 1 out, with remote control, Built-in Equalizer, Blue Jeans Cable brand, for the lack of HDMI inputs.  After many hours of effort, I believe I'll have a fulfilling video experience from my new TV. I just wish it was easier not to cost Amazon's profit in trying to get a quality viewing experience, but it was their idea to try and service my need in that area, so I'm not feeling guilty.
