We moved the set to a larger room and was replacing a 32-inch SONY Bravia which, except for size, was a great HDTV. After reading other reviews, I wasn't confident that the JVC would be comparable to the SONY in features or image quality and was pleasantly surprised to find that it performs better in all respects.  I can only say ... WOW this JVC is a great buy!  Plugged in components with HDMI and all was absolutely perfect without any adjustments required. That being said, I need to point out that I am using my Panasonic DVD player for internet connectivity because it has a more full range of media providers, including Amazon.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV, Great Deal for the Money", "Author": "Douglas Beckling \"Doug44\"", "ReviewID": "R3HE6DQB1X1IXV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now this is a really Nice tv for the money. Plus it has Netflix, pandora, Youtube, and a couple more Apps. It has everything I wanted on a tv. 55 Inches is big and the picture is really sharp too. Oh and the Remote has a Keyboard on the back side.That comes in handy for putting in your passwords or for telling what you want to play on Youtube. We are Watching Dancing With The Stars, and it is so nice. It is like going to the movies in your Living room. Buy this one you will like it alot.

The picture quality is amazing.  Best I have ever seen and super crystal clear. The contrast ratio on this is 20,000,000:1, ya find that on another tv! Awesome! The built in ambient sensor adjusts the tv's brightness to match the lightning in the room. The sound quality is outstanding. It has xinema sound 3D and comes with 2-15 watt speakers and a 15 watt subwoofer built in the set.  You don't even need a sound bar with this puppy, although I did purchase one prior to receiving the tv.  The 3D is fantastic and comes with 4 pairs of 3D glasses, no batteries needed. The set has 2 USB ports and 4 HDMI ports, the most I have seen in a set so far. My son hooked his laptop up to the tv and loves to surf on a big 55\" screen! There is a qwerty keyboard on the back on the remote.  Comes wi-fi built in and has netflix, pandora, youtube, hulu, etc. It should be noted that this is NOT a full web browser tv, which was not a problem for me because I have a full web browser on my Samsung 3D DVD player. The tv is super easy to set up.  We had it out of the box and up and running within 20 minutes!  You can't go wrong purchasing this unit.  I have nothing bad to say about it at all.  We love it and would purchase one for every room if we could afford it! Go ahead, get it, what are you waiting for?", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not the best picture", "Author": "Sarah J. Cataldi \"Sarah Jean\"", "ReviewID": "RII4LNWZT0JH1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We are sticking with our Samsung 50 inch plasma tv. Although it takes but 2 more seconds to get Netflix through our PS3 the picture quality of the JVC is just NOT good. The blue hue that you see when you stand on either side of the TV was annoying along with the slight separation of color while watching a movie or show. We changed the settings and color several times. Returning this TV and excited to hookup our 7 years running Samsung that we paid $2400 for back in the day! Def worth the money so we will hold out until it dies! I only gave it 2 stars because the remote is nice and the smartv features. Otherwise what good is watching a color tv when the color isn't good!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible Image Quality", "Author": "Madhav Mehra", "ReviewID": "R3TJG71KWJL2QQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I fell for the reviews. I assumed that in this day and age, with most of the screens made by Samsung and Sharp that all TVs would largely have the same image quality and that the differentiation of the integrated Apps, innovative remote and improved sound would be worth it. Boy was I wrong.Terrible TV.I must say that J&R; Music was a pleasure to deal with as they took back the TV and let me exchange it for a Sony that I love.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "D. stapleton", "ReviewID": "R29DU5UDVMA4OK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "just received and setup our new jvc jle55sp4000 tv that we purchased on hsn tv channel. we are VERY DISAPPOINTED in this tv. the worst tv ever. it is NOT what they claim it to be. our old 52 inch rca rear projection tv that we have now is a thousand times better than this tv will ever be. as soon as we turned it on we knew immediatly that we werent going to like it. it is blurry, out of focus and has shadows everywhere, especially text. not just tv channels but the tv menu items themselves look terrible and are blurry and have shadows. it is built into this tv. if you dont have all digital tv channels do not buy this tv. it is not viewable on standard channels. Hd channels looked a lot better but at this price range there are a lot of options available. what i do know is its not this tv. we tried tweaking every possible setting to get this tv to look better. nothing helped. it is what it is. the sound quality is ok but it doesnt have this cinema sound and deep bass that is supposed come from the so called built in subwoofer. no built in web browser. have already boxed it back up and are going to return it at our own expense asap. going to be looking at a samsung or sharp, the only tvs worth buying.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quite Disappointed with my Purchase", "Author": "Vivian", "ReviewID": "R26BRLQBJWKJLK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So I finally got a smart TV and I was totally excited for it. I was literally jumping up and down when the TV arrived to my house. I read the instructions, set it up and the screen was mat and very pretty. The remote was really cool because there was the actual remote on one side and a keyboard on the other. After I set it up (which I found quite easy) I put the batteries into the remote (which they included), waited for the the screen to load, and was totally disappointed. The box clearly stated \"55 LED 120HZ 1080P 3D\" but to my surprise, it was not that way. When I was entering the password for the internet into the TV, the remote buttons weren't only hard to push in but on the \"HD\" screen, I could see each of the separate pixels. Then, I thought that maybe if I change the settings once I was finished with the scan that took like half an hour, it would look better. Well, I waited for the entire time in high anticipation and again, I was disappointed. It turns out you can't change the quality of the screen and it WASN'T 3D!  I even called the service guy and he said that you can't do anything about it since this stuff is automatic. Then, I tried to get into the internet or into Netflix and of course, it didn't allow me to go into it. I have decided to return this smart TV for another and hopefully, it won't be as bad as this one is. It seems my dreams of a smart TV have gone down the drains and I'll have to have a week of intense research before I will have decided to buy another one although, this time, I want to buy it in person so that not only will I have to go through the trouble of shipping it back to return it but I also want to see my future TV in person.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,163.50", "Features": "55\" LED 120Hz 1080P 3D", "Name": "JVC BlackSapphire JLE55SP4000 55\" 3D 1080p LED-LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lC45KMluL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009EN23ZE"}}
