Likely not true 120hz though.", "Author": "Snaby", "ReviewID": "R22GDBMBDKEYEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love many things about this TV but one of my favorite features is the built-in picture calibration tool. With proper calibration this TV looks just as good if not better than my Samsung LCD.  With 3D Bluray content this TV is fantastic.  The 2d to 3d conversion is neat but nowhere close to the quality of true 3d content.  Also, it's nice that \"movie theater\" glasses work with this set.  I notice very little motion blur but LGs claim of 120 hz is likely bogus.  Apparently this model and several others LG put out are actually 60hz panels that they cycle the LEDs on and off to claim \"Trumotion 120 hz\".  I spoke with LG directly and they claim 120hz is \"always on\" for this TV, but there are no menu settings or controls for the Trumotion.  You will NOT get the soap opera effect from this TV, but to me that is a good thing, though I realize some people will be disappointed with this. The  HDGURU website has a great article on LGs claim of 120 hz on its review of a similar TV the 55lm6700 called \"When 120 Hz isn't 120Hz\".  Anyway, this was not a deal breaker for me as this TV has such a great picture and the 3d is amazing. (By the way passive 3d sets like this model don't have to have 120 hz as they are using polarization to display two separate images as opposed to cycling images for active shutter glasses). The sound on my set is fine but I ended up getting the TVee 25 soundbar from Boston Acoustics because I wanted the extra punch that a subwoofer adds.  On another note I bought this TV from Walmart for 849 before Christmas and it subsequently went down to 799 an unbelievable value for this set, strangely cheaper than the non-3D \"LS\" version of this set.  It is a myth that these retailers get inferior sets.  As long as the model numbers are the same go for the lowest price you can find with a retailer you feel comfortable dealing with.  I usually buy most of my gear through Amazon but unfortunately they didn't have this set available when I was in the market for a new TV.  If you already have all the \"smart\" gear and just want a fantastic LED TV with the ability to watch 3D content you can't go wrong with this set.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tried 4 Different TVs & This one is the Keeper!", "Author": "Daniel B.", "ReviewID": "R3M5XPQ2PPMEV0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went through 4 TVs before I landed on this 55\" LG LED 55LM4600. Initially bought a very inexpensive Element brand 46\" LCD 60Hz. Picture was just OK and the menus and input/output ports were sorely lacking. Also, I could never make it work with my Harmony Remote properly. Not a keeper. Next was an LG 50\" 1080p Plasma. Great picture but the screen was simply way too glossy. I could not stand seeing the lights reflecting in the screen during the entire movie! Back it went. Next TV was an Insignia from Best Buy. 55\" LED 120Hz. Tons of inputs and outputs. Very nice picture but had major \"soap opera effect\". Every scene looked \"fake\". Not sure how else to describe it but even my wife noticed it. I tried really hard to ignore it but it really did drive me crazy. Changing the motion settings in the menu did not seem to make any difference. Best Buy took it back. (super-great company by the way - very nice and easy to work with!) Next bought a Panasonic 55\" Plasma (ST30) but the Sears store where I went to buy it had been playing the CARS movie non-stop on all their display TVs for 3 months. I was buying the display model (on super sale) and the DVD Title Menu was completely burned into the screen so I passed on that one too. However, sitting right next to it was the LG 55LM4600 55\" LED (also on sale). The picture looked fantastic and I brought that one home instead. I could not be happier. Excellent picture, brighter than any plasma I looked at. No \"soap opera effect\", no ghosting. Very clear and crisp. I'm not a huge sports fan so I cannot testify to refresh but I have not noticed any blurring on any shows. Even the \"ticker\" at the bottom of the screen on news stations look fine to me. Screen is not as matte as the Insignia but still very little in the way of reflection. Works perfect with my Harmony 600 remote and Sony 590 Blu-Ray player. Menus are easy to use (remote is very nice). Comes with 4 pair of 3D glasses too.

I had a 42\" I was looking to replace, but I don't want to be dropping money on a new TV every few years. I wanted to make sure I picked something that would last. So here I am.I purchased this for a few reasons. The price, 3D (honestly didnt care much about this) and the reviews. LG has a good overall review for most of their TV products and coming from the \"low\" end of pricing, it seemed like a good choice. Also, based on value per inch of screen, I chose this one.After receiving it a few days ago, I must say this TV is AWESOME! It looks great. Converts 2D-3D if you want (looks alright). Colors are great and has options to modify if needed.Now with that said, I will give you some pros/cons I have seen so far:Pros:Price4 Sets of 3D Glasses3D that looks AWESOMESize of the screenThinnessUSB port you can plug things in like flash drive to see pix etc.Divx SupportSupports WiFi/LANEasy to use remoteSmall bezelEasy to learn and use (settings, etc)Wall mountableCons:This sells as a 120hz TruMotion, but in reality, it is a 60hz TV with some \"tweaks\".Only 3 HDMI (I need more)The manual states it needs 4 inches of \"breathing room\" so that killed the flat against the wall mount idea.There seems to be some ghosting on some 3D, but maybe it's a settings thing I haven't figured out yet.No customization naming for the ports such as HDMI, etc. It does have some preset ones you can choose from.Some have complained of audio. I feel it compares to many others out there and it shouldn't be that big of a deal. I think it sounds great/loud. When I want to listen/watch a movie, I use a receiver/speakers, as you should as well.I had an issue with shipping as well. Heads up, of course depending on the seller, you may need to schedule a delivery date and time. I was sent a general email that the TV was shipped and given a tracking number but it didn't correspond with regular shippers. I had to contact the seller to get the shipper and then found out that they tried an old number to contact me and since they couldn't contact me, they had send me a postcard for a time. I was able to contact the shipper and get it fixed, but there wasn't any info that stated all that was going to happen.Overall, this TV is a great buy and product and you will not be unhappy with.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Audio is horrible.

Thinking that a 55 inch, 1080, 3d tv for that cheap most have some serious issues, I did a little research.  Finding nothing wrong, I purchased the TV and are very happy I did.Pros:Packaging- The television came packaged up amazingly.  It was wrapped up in very firm Styrofoam that was very well done.Setup- The setup was very simple.  It did require two of us, my wife and I, but that is simply due to size, not weight.  My arms were not wide enough to fit around the entirety of the screen.  But it was incredibly easy to setup.Picture- The picture is really quite good.  At first my wife was complaining but that's because she didnt connect our satellite box up with an HDMI cord.  Once we fixed the issue, it was amazing.  Crisp picture and beautiful edges which was very nice.  The picture was a little dark for me, but that was easily fixed in the televisions menu.3D- The 3D looks great. You will need to purchase a 3D blu-ray player and 3D movies.  When you do, the picture is great.  It isnt dark like most other 3D televisions.  It is an easy switch and the picture looks really great.3D Glasses- The TV comes with 4 pairs which is nice.  Also, the TV works with the glasses that you get from the movie theater.  So, you can always have a ton of pairs.Cons: (Which there are few)2D-3D- It isnt true 3D.  This isnt a major issue as I dont really care about making non 3D things 3D.  There is a layering effect, but it isnt the true 3D, so dont expect much.Mounting- As others have said, you have to have 4 inches of space for cooling purposes.  So, buying a mounting kit isnt the best thing.  That is not an issue for me as I have a stand that like.  If you are interested in mounting this TV, you will need four inches of clearance.Sound- The sound is not horrible for a flat screen TV, in fact I would say that it is actually better then most.  However, you might need to bump up the sound on some channels because it can in fact seem really low.  However, you can purchase a 3D blu-ray player with sound system for around $200.00. Then, just connect the speaker to the TV and you have fantastic sound.Overall, I am incredibly pleased with this TV.  It was a nice purchase, and look around online, you may be able to find it for cheaper.  Highly recommend.Update:::I have had this TV for about a month so far and it has honed itself and it is working incredibly.  My wife and I love it.  The only issue that I seem to have is that it seems to reset itself every time we turn it off.  We, perhaps, are doing something wrong, but it resets.

The 2D to 3D works pretty okay, but the split-screen to one screen 3D converter gaming definitely takes some getting used to. I haven't tried it out yet, because the TV is currently above a fireplace, but you can adjust the angle of the 3D. So theoretically if I can mount the TV eye level, I can adjust the 3D to only affect top / bottom and or left / right and improve upon the split screen overlay. Has anyone tried this?This is a really thin 3d tv. Really takes some tweaking to get things looking great, and even when you have settings up as high as possible without looking washed out, I still don't necessarily feel 'wow'ed. I believe this might be due to viewing angle, and again will be solved by making the TV eye level. My 50\" Panasonic plasma looked great up there on the mantle but that's comparing apples to oranges.Most programs were good, but the first one program I watched with the adjust and fit aspect ratio mode that had that solid yellow line down the left side made me forever switch to another viewing mode. Couldn't stand it. Wife didn't see it until I walked up to it and pointed it out to her.Still it's my first 3D TV and I love it. Cheap w/ 2D to 3D mode? Yes!

And considering it is half the price of a Samsung make the deal even better. Now for some advice... If you have researched 3D TVs you know this uses passive glasses. Samsung uses active glasses that use a battery. I bought an active glasses 3D TV a year and a half ago for more than twice this price because active 3D gives you full 1080 3D where the passive, using polarized glasses, only gives you \"half def\" or 540 for each eye. After having the Samsung for only a short time I realized I blew a lot of money I didn't have to spend and I hate the active glasses. You have to turn them on each time and the batteries run dead. The passive glasses you just pop on; and they are lighter... A no brainier in my opinion. Whether you are looking at this or any other 3D TV take my advice and buy LG or Vizio with passive glasses.

(I've owned this TV for three weeks.)I tried several TV brands/models, and this one was the best.  Extra-sharp, beautiful, realistic HD picture quality.  Real and pretty colors.  There is no \"smooth\" mode (so-called on Toshiba models) which most people call the \"soap opera effect.\"  I LIKE that mode, as it's amazing for things like the wildlife shows on Animal Planet, and for making blu rays of older movies jump off the screen with sharpness and lifelike vividness.  But not having this feature is not a major thing, either, as it's a minor inconvenience to switch to it and then to switch back later.This 55\" TV was next to a 55\" $1360.00 Samsung (reputedly the best HD TV brand) at Costco, clearly both were set to the same settings, and the pictures were IDENTICAL (and I'm extremely detail-oriented).  It was nearly impossible to see a difference as to sharpness, color, brightness, you name it. And I looked for a long time.  Where there were any tiny differences at all: advantage LG.The sound is easily loud enough without a sound bar, and it has good stereo and surround-sound effects--but not as good as my 1998 JVC tube TV (this is a problem on all flat-screen TVs due to the inherent limitations on speaker size).However, I DID experience the speaker problems cited by other reviewers: vibrating sounds that occur only on SOME TV programs, even at very low volumes (like at setting 12 out of 100 max).  I do believe the vibrating/almost buzzing problem only occurs for certain TYPES of sounds--this person's voice, that particular musical instrument playing only CERTAIN notes--because this ANNOYING speaker vibration doesn't occur the majority of the time, EVEN when at much louder volumes. This will bother me a little forever, every time it occurs, I'm sure, as it simply shouldn't exist.I think this is something that LG should have gotten right, since no other TV brand seems to do this. I called LG about it, and they suggested a very bad thing--to turn down the CABLE BOX's own volume by 25%. . . which of course would eliminate the stereo sound (on my box, anyway) and permanently lower the volume of any DVD recordings you might make.  I didn't try this, because it's not even possible to do for the home user--I subsequently called my cable company so as to try doing it, and they took me to the right menu, but, as they acknowledged, it simply cannot be done on my Comcast box.Overall, however, I love this TV for its immaculate, best-in-class picture, fine remote control, great looks, swiveling stand, and great value ($699.00 at Costco before they sold out).", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth Your Pennies!!!

I then went to Sam's club and got another one. The one from Sam's club, didn't have ANY ghosting at all. Maybe they carry higher quality versions of this at Sam's club?? Another reason why I returned the previous one, was that after a firmware update, the tv would not let me control picture settings that I could previously control.

I am very happy with this television though, and get compliments on it when people are watching a 3d movie, or bluray.

I haven't gotten a new TV in 6 years and it's pretty amazing how they can make such a huge TV so thin now. At 1.4\" thick with a thin, shiny black bezel, it looks really great either turned on or off.This was very easy to assemble out of the box.  The supplied stand was simple to connect to the TV...5 minutes and I had it connected and propped up on my entertainment center.  I didn't realize you could swivel the stand...nice touch.Initial set up was quick and simple as well.  The menus are easy to follow and straight forward.  The supplied remote control is well laid out and easy to use.  I turned on the TV, went through the initial set up process, and I was up and running in about 5-10 minutes.The number of video outputs worked out perfectly for me (3 HDMI for XBox, PS3, and Apple TV, 1 component for my cable box, and 1 USB for whatever). And I can finally replace the old red and white RCA cable going from the TV to the surround sound receiver with a digital optical audio cable.As far as the picture goes...I'm not a videophile by any means, but I think the picture on this TV looks great. It definitely took some tweaking right out of the box, but the built in calibration tool is useful, and I was also able to find some people online that shared their calibration settings. After a while I was able to find the sweet spot for my viewing preferences.The 3d function is useable, though I didn't buy the TV for this purpose.  I played around with the 2d to 3d conversion and it is pretty neat and surprisingly effective.  I haven't gotten the chance to do any 3d gaming or watch any 3d movies, but I expect those experiences will be even better.The menus are well laid out, simple to follow, and have a generally \"premium\" look to them.  The supplied remote control looks nice, feels solid, has large (but not too large) buttons, and is very easy to use.All in all I am very happy with this TV.  I specifically wanted to get a \"non smart TV\" for the fact that I already have all of the apps and functionality I need with my XBox, PS3, and Apple TV.  I was really happy to find such a high quality TV without all the frills.  I was more than happy to pay a couple hundred dollars less for a quality TV set without the \"smart\" capability.  The fact that it has 3d capability was a really nice extra that seemed almost \"free\" considering the price tag.I decided to choose this TV over a smiliarly priced 55\" Samsung TV because this set was about $90 cheaper, it has 3 HDMI outputs as opposed to 2 on the Samsung, and it has the 3d function (icing on the cake).  So far I am very happy with my decision.I was able to purchse this set for $799 + $29 shipping and at that price I feel it was an absolute bargain.EDIT:  There have been a lot of negative things said about the sound quality on this TV and the internal speakers making rattling noises and things like that.  I have not experienced any issues with the sound on my TV whatsoever.  Granted, they are internal TV speakers so you can't really expect mind blowing sound out of them, but I have found the sound to be quite adequate at normal viewing levels.  I have actually noticed a few different sound effects and things like that on programs that I would watch on my previous TV that I had never heard before.

Manual says to keep this 4 inches away from the wall so not sure how great wall mounting will be if you choose to.Be warned that it wouldn't recognize a good portion of my inputs until I used brand new HDMI cords (used the Amazon Basics cords, other ones were a few years old at that point).Actual setup was very easy. I'm using a HD Cable box via Comcast and couldn't get it to scan my channels into it, not sure if that's a flaw or user error on my end.Inputs: TV has majority of the inputs on the back - one HDMI and the PC are on the side. Has a optical output, etc too for sound systems.Features:2D-3D: So it's not real 3D, let's get that out of the way. Whereas 3D pops out, this makes it sort of layered. It's interesting. So far tested on Despicable Me and the Matrix.DLNA. So if you install Nero MediaHome Essentials, you can stream from your PC to your TV pretty flawlessly (both have to be on the same network). Worked with most of my files, though some had audio issues.Volume: volume levels aren't bad. I can usually play my Xbox on like 10-20 without issue. Volume for TV is fine around 20-30 or so.

I was blown away with it, and the 3d is especially good when watching news and commercials. It's not as dramatic in comparison to watching an actual 3d movie, but it's good enough. It adds a lil bit of fun to watching my fave tv shows. The screen is a bit big so you can't be too close when turning on the 3d feature (they recommend sitting 2 meters away).The tv itself is sharp and bright. Picture quality is superb. I haven't updated the firmware yet so I hope I don't run into the same issues as the other reviewer when updating the firm ware. I also compared this TV to a similar model in Sams Club by  Vizio and Samsung. Ofcourse, the Samsung beats both competitors but only seems to be marginally better than this LG model. The LG model was by far sharper-looking, had better screen quality and brighter than the Vizio. The LG was actually the cheapest of the three at only 898 at Sams!", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Great picture!", "Author": "John R Hunter", "ReviewID": "RUZRHER7N4DXT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We put these HDTV in the hotel i work for The Westin DFW Airport and i just had to have one with this great picture!", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "its great", "Author": "elgo", "ReviewID": "R22DWNOBTR6FK6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the tv is beautifull, great image but the TruMotion function can not be changed, there no exist option in the menu the tv, according the lg page [...] , \"The TruMotion feature is activated at the factory, and is set to its LOW setting by default.

The picture quality in great, crystal clear. I only tried the 2d-3d conversion a few times, but it does add something extra to regular TV and games. I prefer to put in a high quality 3d blu-ray movie and enjoy it at it's glory. I'm very happy with my choice, this TV is just what I wanted and a beautiful addition to our new home.

It was 2am when I ordered, clicked the wrong one.As far as this tv goes.. It's awesome.  Great value.  You can't find deals like this.. Even at Walmart.  Not with all these features.  Shipping took alittle bit due to the shipping company they used. (1.5 weeks)My fianc\u00e9 and I are very satisfied with this TV.  Looks great on the wall.  If you wall mount it.. Be sure to buy the swivel wall mount, spend the extra money for it, you just paid $740 for a $1200 tv, you can spare the extra $30 for the swivel mount.
