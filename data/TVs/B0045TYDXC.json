{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrific 2D image, Good in 3D, less than stellar remote", "Author": "Mark Sumner \"Devilstower\"", "ReviewID": "R1DBQTPVI5SOHW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 2D image here is extremely sharp, almost shockingly so. Remember when you first moved from SD to HD and all the TV shows suddenly seemed kind of... shabby? As if the sets just weren't up to HD scrutiny? The image here is so clear, the colors so deep and the contrast so high, that you can have that experience over again. Sometimes it even feels like the 2D images are 3D. Compared to my earlier sets, it's actually disorienting.I've made some changes to the review to address questions and discoveries.CalibrationAs usual, the out of the box settings tend to favor a brightness that could give you a tan. However, the default \"movie\" mode tones things down a lot (and looks very much like what I got after spending hours on calibration, so you may want to spare the effort and just make that quick selection, assuming all these things emerge from the box equal). Technically, the out of the box modes all seem to run a little to the \"warm\" side, so you'll need to cool the image down a bit if you want the textbook values, but I find myself liking the warmer image a bit better. Somehow (even though I know better) it looks more lifelike.Screen glossinessThe screen is glossy. Yup. I've found that it doesn't cause a problem during the day because the set's inherent brightness shrugs off evenly distributed lighting from reflected sources (I don't get direct sun on the set, but that would be inadvisable for most sets). And naturally, the set looks great in a dim room. However, if you're sitting down and have some lamps in front of it at night, they can be reflected. Some reflections even give a scattered, prismatic effect that can be distracting. It's not a big deal. It doesn't take on the mirror-like appearance of some screens. But it is noticeable and may require that you rearrange your set position or lighting.RemoteThe slide-out keyboard remote works fairly well, but it has a list of problems. First off, it's not backlit, and on a remote this complex that's a real problem if you expect to use it to replace your cable box or DVD remotes. You'll find lots of small buttons, many almost flush with the case, that you can't make out by touch. The slide-out alpha keyboard is fine for entering information needed to access Netflix or search for clips, but a Tweet is about the longest thing that can be typed comfortably. The handling of multiple devices is both clever and irritating. The remote associates a device with each input to the TV. So if you tell it that HDMI-1 is your satellite box and HDMI-2 is your blueray player it will (after correct setup) switch the remote function to the appropriate device when you switch input. However, getting it to control a different device -without- changing the input (if, for example, you have all your devices running through a receiver) is much less neatly handled.3DInitially, I was having trouble getting DirectTV to recognize this set as 3D and kept getting the \"Your 3D TV does not support this resolution.\" This appears to have been resolved, and I can now watch soccer re-runs and old tennis games while waiting for more 3D content along with everyone else. The depth of the 3d is good -- equal to the apparent depth on the Samsung X500, which is the best I've seen. However, there is no apparent way to use the 3D effect on 2D images which, while a gimmick, is a handy gimmick when you don't feel like watching \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" for the 20th time just to see some 3D.USBI've been unable to view any video off USB ports. I have a downloaded 3D clip saved to a flash drive which was provided as a test of the Samsung. Though there are 3 USB ports, none of them seem to recognize the clip (or actually, to even respond to inserting the flash drive)2D Image qualityI'm still very taken with the 2D image. Even neighbors who were unimpressed with previous Vizio sets are excited by this one. Very deep blacks, color saturation nice (initial setup is slightly on the warm side... but I find that I rather like it). Brightness and contrast have a wide range and will go right up to the \"torch\" level that many stores seem to like. If you think it looks good on the shelf at Megamart, it looks even better on the wall at home.I've upped my rating a star after two weeks of owning the set. I still wish it came with an improved remote, but now that it's all calibrated and connected to my system, I have little else to complain about.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "XVT3d554SV Good value", "Author": "Gordon8452", "ReviewID": "ROBMWC4GV746G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me preface this review first off with the fact that I have not yet purchased the 3d glasses, so this review is about everything else.I ordered mine through Sam's club on a day when they had free shipping, so I paid $1999 plus sales tax.  Purchased on December 11th.Superb clarity and 2d picture quality.  Almost shockingly so, the picture is very crisp, details pop.  Color was obviously crap from the retailer, as with any tv you will want to make sure you adjust it accordingly.  Brightness for mine was way too high from factory, and colors were a bit off.  If you don't want to go with a professional calibration from someone with the hardware to do it, a good baseline is to use a THX certified dvd or blu-ray made within the past few years and find the THX optimizer in the menus.  Blacks are very black, not that sort of greyish backlit black you get from edge lit or ccfl backlit models.  Very impressed with black level.The tv has plenty of inputs, enough hdmi to hook up lots of dvr, gaming system, htpc, etc.  Same with audio inputs.  You do get an rgb pc input with a 3.5mm audio in to match, pretty standard on a vizio, but not included on alot of other maker's sets.  Three USB ports that are currently useless (more on that later).  One good thing to note is that the hdmi inputs are downfacing, which make this set a decent choice for wallmounting.  Unfortunately most of the audio inputs as well as the rj45 ethernet jack are rear facing.The menu system is a fairly straightforward layout.  You have the regular audio and video options, the input selection, and the via internet apps stuff.  It isn't terribly difficult to navigate around and find what you are looking for.  The set came with a pretty decent manual, and it's easily findable on their website as well.  I haven't had the chance to use vizio's telephone support recently, but I had used it about two years ago for a set my mother owned and they were really great.  It was a call center in California, not overseas, and the set ended up getting exchanged with minimal hassle.  Hopefully they still have great service, but also I hope to not have to use it either.Internet apps.  These are pretty much identical in layout to all the other major brands who offer them.  All the standard ones are there, and work just fine.  Netflix and Amazon HD streaming worked well, I have seen no hiccups over the wireless connection viewing either for the past few weeks.  Pandora also works well.  Wifi worked straight up out of the box with my home network as did a wired connection.I did not have issues with the remote, though I am a normal user of a qwerty slideout smartphone, so it may just be me.  The remote does feel very light, which gives it a sort of cheap quality feeling, but in my use the sliding mechanism is solid and it isn't really awkward to use.  The up/down/left/right arrows would be better placed on the right side, but I can see why the put them on the left as the red/blue/yellow/green buttons are on the right.I received it in good working order, no dead pixels, no issues with the dimming zones greying I have seen a few others on here had.  After the few weeks usage I have had and the break in period, I have seen no issues.  As with other full array backlit sets, there is some halo effect when you have bright white text on a solid black background.  It is expected until such time as we have tv sets which can control each LED individually, or when there is a sufficient number of dimming zones to abate this effect.  I haven't had any issues with refresh or anything.  Pretty quick response time.The screen is glossy.  Alot of vizio sets come with a matte screen, this one doesn't.  This will affect some people more than others.  My particular room setup causes this to be a non-issue, but your mileage may vary in this respect.The bezel is also glossy, not really an issue, but it displays fingerprints and dust considerably more so than a matte bezel.  This is a vizio, not a samsung, so the bezel is plenty wide.  Not really an issue for me but if you are OCD about this sort of thing, just something to take note of.A few features I wish were included:Use of USB ports.  According to vizio - Functionality to be enabled in the future.  The future is now and most other manufacturers now provide this functionality out of the box on sets of similar price and model range.  Same with DLNA.  Include it.  Should be standard on a $2k set.From what I can tell the HDMI inputs do not include audio return channel functionality.  I have a home theatre setup and an hdmi running from my denon receiver to the set itself for my blu-ray, htpc, etc.  It works well, but when I want to use the Vizio Internet apps on the set and have the sound through the receiver I have to hook up an additional cable to have the audio go out from the tv to the receiver.  This should be unnecessary as HDMI standards support audio return over the hdmi cable.  The tv has both a red and white rca style audio out as well as an optical toslink style out.Honestly this is a great set so far.  Those issues are pretty nitpicky.  I did my research and viewed many sets locally and read regarding the other options available.  At the time of this writing, samsung has no full array backlit 3d models out, all are edge-lit, and while nice, I bought this set specifically for the full array local dimming.  Sony has the hx909 and lg has the lx9500 for full array local dimming sets.  However I was unable to find the sony set at any retailer within a decent price difference to the vizio.  Similarly for the lg, they were just considerably more expensive, and the wifi was a separate addon for additional cost.  I had also read multiple reviews regarding the LG having banding issues.  So I went with the vizio, for the price you get a ton of features, full array local dimming, and 3d.  I am really quite happy with the choice and do not in any way regret the purchase.UPDATE 1/6/11: As of this morning, Vizio has enabled the USB ports via firmware upgrade, they are now accessible through the VIA apps.  They only show photos and music from a usb drive though, no video.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best 2010 TV on the market for the money", "Author": "Kuala", "ReviewID": "RBXRDGJ22I624", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really wanted the CNET Best Buy rated 55\" non 3D model XVT553SV but couldn't find any in stock anywhere. The 47\" had some good deals but is just too small when you compare it to bigger sets. I'm so happy I bought the 55\" 3D instead. The 2D picture is absolutely stunning but the 3D is simply amazing and worth the small increase in price compared to the difference in price to a non 3D Samsung. Everyone should demo a 3D in a store before writing it off as a gimmick. DirecTV already has 3 dedicated channels and more 3D video will surely be on the way soon. Games will probably lead the revolution in 3D but 3D sports broadcasts will be awesome as well. The new BluRay players are also now 3D capable. Vizio has long had a rep for the best prices but now they have the best technology and features along with the best prices.This is a complicated entertainment system- not just a TV. It takes a while to get used to, to set up and to test all the amazing features. Most people will never use all of them but there is something amazingly new and cool for everyone. Even the remote is way ahead of its time and needs to be used a lot to get comfortable with. Think of it as a large cell phone with a slide out full keyboard to access all the aps. The LED backlit technology, 480hz refresh rate, the 55\" size, the HD 1080p picture quality and the wireless internet all open the door for the future of internet TV and home entertainment. The 3D just adds one more exciting element to the platform that has to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Its not your father's 3D! Even my wife loves it. This is one of those major innovations that if you don't buy now to save a few bucks you will always wish you had. Your next TV should be a backlit LED, in 3D and offer wireless internet aps and firmware updates. Vizio makes that affordable now.FYI- Although the remote is well thought out and very functional, setting up the remote for other devices takes some practice. If you want to set up the Vizio remote to operate your DirecTV DVR you have to turn off the RF function on the DircTV remote and leave it on IR. The Vizio remote is BluTooth to the TV but only works in IR for other devices. Even Vizio support couldn't figure that one out when my Vizio remote wouldn't set up to run the satellite receiver. My only complaint is not having the remote backlit but even DirecTV doesn't do that. After a short time you get the main keys memorized by feel and location just like every other remote. For the slide out keyboard you will need a light on and tiny fingers. Those who can already text or tweet from a cell phone from their pockets will find it plenty big.The 3D glasses are also BluTooth which makes them superior to the other brand's IR glasses. All in all I am very impressed with Vizio in technology, features and value. I just hope it holds up better than my Sony HD Plasma did.

Bosak \"SRB\"", "ReviewID": "R1SJQEHFY9NKGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent months doing research, and lots of review/viewing/and interviewing to come to this decision. I think the deciding factor was when I told a sales accocite at a big box store about the 480Hz and back-lit features of this set when compared to a Samsung, he said \"well, hell, if they have those features for less than the Samsung, you should buy it.\" We did. The picture is as good as Samsung, better than Sony, and comes in much lower in price. Research shows Vizio is using the same glass and LEDs as Samsung. Regardless of the ambient light, the picture is brilliant and well-defined. The blackest blacks I've seen, even when compared to most plasma TVs. Easy set up, and instantly recognized my DISH DVR reciever and trained the remote. Works flawlessly with the PS3, especially with 3D (Tron, bowling) and Move games (The Shoot, Sports Champions. I haven't even tweaked the standard settings-- just paired it with the Vizio soundbar/sub woofer, deleted a few worthless (to us) Internet Widgets. The bulit in Wi-Fi works flawlessly with our home network, and took 10 seconds to setup with the initial setup ultility. Netflix works great with no bandwidth issues. My wife and I actually love the remote. Sure, backlighting would be great, but so would free popcorn for life. You can't have everything, but this set comes VERY close.3D: great 3D picture on The Universe and on 3D games. (that's all we have at moment.) Vizio's 3D glasses are WAY less expensive than the competition-- You can pick up two sets for $148 at Sam's Club...far less than the $200 a pop for each set of Sony, Samsung, et al.The only thing I can't vouch for is reliability, which only time will tell.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "After 3 months of research, the Vizio was the best value", "Author": "R.

It was a difficult decision for me to choose Vizio, as my last 5 HDTV's were either Sony or Samsung and I was generally very happy with those TV's, however, when it came to buying a 3D HDTV there were not many reviews to help me.I went to several big-box stores, and viewed the 3D sets they had. I asked the attendants (when I could find one) to let me adjust the pictures to my liking. As usual, all the TV's were poorly adjusted on the floor, and the picture could be significantly improved. Only two times was I able to view 3D content, and in both cases I was only able to stand 4 and 6 feet from the screen... not enough for a 55\" display, however it was clear to me that the Vizio glasses were comfortable, and that the 3D effect was stable and clear.I have been very happy with the Vizio, and despite the lack of good 3D software, I feel was an excellent value.My favorite 3D disk is the IMax \"Under the Sea\".

Since it is out of stock on amazon and the vizio website this was a shock so I bought it. As I hooked it up and turned in on I was in awe of the picture. Law and Order Los Angeles was on and it looked like it was live, no exaggeration. I had to stare at it for just a moment. I then set up my Netflix and that works beautifully. At 7.99/month and direct streaming to TV the premiere movie channels should be scared.Now the remote just sucks to put it harshly. I am sticking with my comcast remote even though the vizio remote can perform the same functions. It is just not comfortable. The keyboard is a pain. You just need to to access your setting and the VIA apps aside from that just don't bother, in my opinion. It was a cool idea but the keyboard should just be a separate stand alone option. In their haste to integrate the ruined a simple device).I did have issues hooking it up to my stereo receiver. For some reason the AV out jacks on the TV did not work. I don't know if I just did not have the settings right on my TV or receiver or it is just malfunctioning. In either case I just decided to use the optical output and it works just fine.So aside from the remote and the some issues with the hookup it was worth it. The picture is great and that is our sole/main purpose for TV. The VIA apps are okay but I do not put too much stock in that feature except for the movie streaming.Added 1/12.Still pleased with the TV but I came across something and was wondering if it may just be an issue of mine. I recently recieved my Vizio 3D glasses and decided to try it out on some Comcast 3D content On-demand. It appears that when then I use the glasses it keeps by cablebox from recieveing signals from the remote control (thats either the vizio or comcast remote.). Only after turning off the box manually and shutting off everything does it return back to normal. After severla trials I found this to happen only after using the 3D glasses. has anyone else expired something similar?", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great TV", "Author": "Eric Cencer", "ReviewID": "RDST76RMJLEVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with the specs and performance of the XVT3D554SV. I have to admit that I'm on my second one already.  The first was delivered exactly as scheduled during the checkout process on Amazon.  But after setting it up, I noticed a whistle that changed pitch with screen color.  I called Vizio support and they diagnosed a power board problem and sent a new one to me within a week and picked up the old one.  The whistle is gone.Setup - My hookup is cable TV into a Tivo HD with two cable cards; HDMI from Tivo to A/V Receiver; HDMI from receiver to TV.  Additionally I have a PS3 going into the receiver. So, I'm essentially only using a single HDMI into the TV and using my receiver to switch between the sources.  I'm sure i will need to revise this setup and add the audio going back from the TV and into the receiver if I want to start using the streaming features built into the VIA apps.  Finally, I have the new Vizio 802.11n dual-band router (also very happy with) and the TV recognized it and connected without problem.The remote - I also have to disagree with other reviews about the remote.  I agree that the size is a bit awkward, but I like that it's Bluetooth, I like the slide out qwerty (true, you won't type up a paper on it and fingers work better than thumbs on the top row), and I like that it works with my other components. It even works well controlling the Tivo (I can do all the Tivo menu functions).2D picture - I expect nothing less than a great picture from an HD tv, and this one delivers.  This TV replaces a Sony XBR Bravia that I really liked.  The Vizio has topped it.  The picture color and sharpness are incredible. Blu-ray movies from the PS3 look incredible.3D picture - I picked up two pairs of the 3D glasses but so far my only 3D content has been Call of Duty - Black Ops for the PS3.  Sure enough, it's in 3D.  I think it's pretty good and look forward to renting a 3D movie to investigate more.Extras - The VIA apps work pretty well.  I haven't done too much with them yet, but I like that I can setup multiple user profiles, including one for guests and lock out admin control.I highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Customer Service...but I wish I hadn't needed it. Twice...and definitely not excellent the second time", "Author": "Uma Duffy", "ReviewID": "RMGC98WUAHUFV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this set because I already have a 37\" Vizio that is rock solid and I love it.  We'd already cut the cable cord and I thought this XVT3D554SV  would be great since it had the internet apps, etc. The picture IS great... but it completely cut out after 2 days necessitating a service call to replace 4 different boards inside the set.  Seems they KNOW there is a bad batch of circuit boards out there and they aren't going to replace them BEFORE they sell you the television.  Even so, the customer service rep was extremely helpful and got the ball rolling and a repair guy, also excellent, came to the house and methodically swapped out board after board until he finally resuscitated the set.  That was an awful lot of moula for a set that worked only 2 days and it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence to know that they probably knew the set would fail and shipped it anyway. I think they should have given me a brand new set that they knew was going to work and refurbed the lemon they sold me.As for the internet apps... Hulu and Netflix are so impossibly slow to load...and it's not my internet connection, either.  I run 2 Roku boxes that load incredibly fast and those boxes only cost $99 each. I would have expected much better from a $1500 set.  I haven't stuck with the loading of the Hulu and Netflix because we switch to the Roku just to get going in a timely way...plus it appears that I get more out of the subscriptions by using the Roku.  It doesn't seem that the full Netflix or Hulu is readily available...or maybe I just haven't figured that out yet.  I guess I don't have the patience when the Roku is proving to be so superior in that regard.And, while I knew that we wouldn't be getting any 3-D glasses in the package, I have to say,  it seems pretty chintzy on the part of Vizio not to include at least one pair.  Customers should get everything you need to enjoy the full functionality of the purchase. Batteries not included is one thing, but if you're selling a 3-D set, I ought to be able to enjoy 3-D out of the box.The remote has the feel of a very cheap grade of brittle plastic, it doesn't follow the format of my other Vizio remote, and it is impossible to tell right side up from upside down in the dark.  Plenty of room for improvement there.I would have been a lot happier with this whole experience at about $500 less than I paid.That said...I love the tv, it has a fantastic picture and I hope that this set lasts for a very, very long time.******revised rating******So here it is, December 5, 2011 and 3 stars plummets to 1 lonely star (only because I can't give negative stars).After the repair guy did his magic we thoroughly enjoyed about 3-4 weeks of stunning tv.  Really, it was great.  But on 11/30/2011 in the morning I was watching the news, scanning during the commercials for another channel and it just goes completely black.  Still great sound...zero picture, nada.  I get to work and call Vizio immediately and wait on hold only to be told they can't do anything unless I'm right in front of the tv, prepared to go through the power down- cycle up sequence that I learned pretty well from the first catastrophic failure. As though perhaps I hadn't thought to do that already, 3x. I told Vizio then that I wanted a new working tv, most definitely from a batch that didn't need all the circuit boards replaced.  I get home that evening and call again and I'm understandably pretty steamed by now and tell them they had their chance to fix it, now I want a new tv. The response? Oh no, simply not possible.  I bought and paid for a NEW tv but they're going to replace it(if they absolutely have to) with a \"recertified\" tv.  We quibble for a time over the the issue of recertified vs refurbished vs open box and I'm not interested in anything but a new tv, you know, like I paid for.  I'm starting to wonder if I already HAVE a \"recertified\" tv and that's the whole problem, since I have no idea if what I got was EVER really new. As a side note I've purchased many recert/refurb/open box computer items and paid a much lesser price than new and got a much lesser warranty and all was still right with the world. Anyway, back to the story...So this goes on for an interminable amount of time (wherein I say: new tv or full refund)and the guy finally says fine, you can have a new tv. Only the next morning I get a call from the supervisor saying we're shipping you a tv....a RECERTIFIED tv.  So we're back to square one and I said no. In her infinite generosity she offers to escalate the issue but I had the definite impression that I was really heading for the bottom of the circular file. The escalation person finally lets us know that the recert is their final offer and I said I'll think about it.That's when I did what I should have done in the first place.  I called the number on the back of my Amazon Rewards card. And in less than 24 hours my full purchase price was refunded.  So pay attention here because this is the moral of the story...If you want to take a chance on this tv ( and I can't imagine why you would)be absolutely sure to pay with an excellent credit card that will intercede for you with Vizio and refund your money at the first sign of trouble.  I really believe that Vizio is eyes wide open with respect to knowing that there is a seriously bad batch of tvs out there and they are perfectly willing to ship them to you anyway.  And if they ever come to get mine, I sincerely hope you aren't the one to get my soon to be 'recertified' boat anchor.They called today, btw, two days after I got my refund, to say that they'd now like to ship a brand new set to me.  I think I'm going to say no...I didn't even mention in the first review that when the tv was originally shipped to my place of business, it arrived before anyone had arrived at work that day and was sitting out in the driveway , fully exposed...no one I know had ever signed for it. I had a few early bird customers sitting in our lot who recounted watching the guy just back the truck up and leave it there...and then drive off.  I don't think I'll give them another opportunity to ship an expensive item like this just to leave it outside , fully exposed to the elements and thieves... I'm still wondering if the freight company forged my signature...Moral of the story part 2Amazon is still the best internet retailer for my money.  Thanks, Amazon for making this right. I was seriously panicked at the thought of getting stuck with a recertified replacement that would limp along until the day after the warranty expired. That Samsung 8000 is looking better and better.  Maybe I'll try that one.  The picture on that Vizio 3d xvt554 , when it had one, was perfection. I loved it and I just really wanted them to come through for us.

I didn't think anything could be better than my VF552XVT. Man was I wrong.I looked at several 3D HDTVs for months before buying this one and this TV, hands down, is without a doubt the best HD and Full HD 3D TV on the market in the under $5,000 price range. I looked at Samsung, Sony, Panasonic and LG and in my opinion the Vizio smoked them all with ease pound for pound.The HD will definitely have your eyes wide open in amazement but the 3D will have you stuck on stupid, only able to utter WOW every thirty seconds or so for a while. Even my wife was blown away. Their Full 3D technology and 1080p active shutter glasses are made by the new undisputed champs in the 3D world, RealD, the same company who makes the 3D tech used in movie theaters. And I guess they pulled everything they could out of their trick bag because the 3D picture is nothing short of ridiculously amazing. Some minor settings tweaking and it was all good.Some people complained about the ghosting and I know for a fact that this has nothing to do with the TV itself, but rather the content. The only time I have seen some ghosting is when I was watching content from my cable company. I have never seen ghosting on a 3D Blu-ray, video game or rented 3D content through the cable company or Sony PlayStation Store. The images are startling clear with amazing depth of field, rich robust colors and incredible realism.And as far as the glasses go, I suggest you shop around on the net. We got our glasses at amazing prices for RealD 3D certified active shutter glasses. We got them all from BJ's wholesale club in store. Sam's Club has them also. Our first 2 pair pack was $150. I went back a week or so later and they were $130 so I got another 2 pair pack. About a week after that I decided to get another pair and they were down to $100. So I got 6 pairs of these awesome glasses for less than $400 and now I have plenty for extra people who come by. PLUS, I got the TV for $1,799 and a pair of HDMI 1.4 cables ($39.99) from BJ's with 2% cash back on top of that. So I got it all for less than $2,200. You cannot get everything this TV offers and comparable tech and glasses from any other company for that price.So my suggestion to you if your are looking for the ultimate affordable Full HD 3D viewing experience, is to purchase this TV, the Vizio HDMI 1.4 cables, a couple 2pair packs of Vizio 3D glasses and prepare to be dumbfounded every time you turn it all on. But don't worry. The stupor isn't permanent. Your intellect will return after a few minutes of constant viewing. ;)", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's very nice, but there is better value out there", "Author": "Andrew S. Lamott", "ReviewID": "R3JVPXUY0A7E10", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased it 12/11 at the local Costco for 1999 + tax.  This is my 1st large flat screen having come from a 2003 Projection screen with HD.  I didn't think there would be that great of a increase in picture quality, but I was very wrong.  The picture is stunning and can be distracting for me as I watch a show.  In the middle of a movie/show I will randomly say, \"Man is this picture amazing\".  So I have zero fault with the clarity of the picture sharpness.  Also, even though I am a very nit picky person, I have noticed very little judder.  (people have said the 480hz stat is a gimmic, I don't know what to think about it)Cons -The remote has been mentioned by others, so I'll leave that one alone.Color settings - it's not natural and I don't understand why they couldn't be right from the factory.Overly bright - someone earlier mentioned putting it in the movie setting to counter and I agree.  At the same time, when I normally can't see the picture during the daytime due to reflections, that bright picture does help.  (I'm talking out of both sides of my mouth)Gaming response delay - I play Black Ops on Xbox 360 and the delay is maddening.  The stats say 4ms.  If that is true, than it's too much of a delay.  Initially you end up going past what your aiming at.  Once you get used to it, still not the same as being able to aim at your target naturally.Reliability - after 3 hours of owning the tv, one of the backlit LED array zones went dim. (it's on the left side, 2nd section, of 5, down from the top)  Looks like a cloud is over that part of the picture.  Maybe it lost it's connection or maybe the dimming sensor is faulty.  Either way, I'm a little freaked out and will be returning it for a different brand.  That being said, went to Ultimate Electronics and found 2 tv's that I like more for less money.  Haven't decided yet, but I like the Panasonic vt25 54\" and the Sony 55NX810.  Both are $100 less than the Vizio and will hopefully be more reliable and better at gaming.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Great Value", "Author": "Bowser B \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "RIN8P9QBKOSZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered from Amazon, the delivery date and time (9-12) was scheduled, and it arrived on time in excellent condition.  [Side note.  Amazon is becoming my new department store:  Cosmetics, books, Kindle, 16x20 photo printer, even my new lawnmower came from Amazon!  Now if we could just get groceries...]Someone else here described the picture as almost painfully sharp.  I think that's pretty accurate.  Movies on the built-in Streaming/Netflix player are so sharp they look like video.  Indeed, it was a little distracting at first.  Like watching a video on \"the making of...\"  The 480Hz effective refresh is very good with fast moving action.  Blur free, almost as good as plasma.  This picture is much sharper than my 32\" Sony.  The Sony is 1080p, so being smaller it should seem sharper, but it does not.  It could be the non-glare screen on the Sony that reduces the apparent sharpness.  So the glossy screen is truly a doubled edged sword.  On the one hand daytime reflections from the windows facing the screen are distracting even with closed miniblinds.  I guess that's the price for the super sharp image.The feature to control a cable/satellite/U-Verse box with the remote is flawed.  Once you configure it, you lose the TV Menu button, as pressing it brings up the cable box menu.  I finally had to do a \"hard reset\" of the TV to remove U-Verse from the remote functionality.  It still works, and the U-Verse remote can be set to control the TV, and that's a better solution.  You can always grab the Vizio remote for special functions.Someone here had difficulty getting external audio to work.  I did not.  Regular audio cables connected to my Sony home theater amp with no problem after turning off the internal speakers.  And, I found that the TV volume control will work the Sony, although the U-Verse remote will not, so I still do not have a one-remote operation.  Pretty minor complaint.  The built-in speakers are better than many I've heard, but for sound that matches the picture quality, you really need an external amp and speakers.The qwerty keyboard in the remote is a big time saver for all the typing necessary to operate a modern TV.  My fat fingers make it a little tricky, but it's no worse than my HTC smartphone slide out keyboard.Internet apps.  A few...weather, facebook, twitter.  It's not a full-blown web browser, though, so it's pretty limited, and on facebook, it seems to put the oldest posts first, the reverse of facebook on a computer.  The Netflix interface is excellent.  Like with others and blueray players with Netflix, you still need a computer to browse the Netflix catalog and put shows in your queue.  The set supports Amazon.com streaming as well as the usual free (and worth the price you pay) streaming services.  So far, no Hulu Plus.  Hopefully that will be coming soon. All in all, though, having the Internet movies built in, rather than requiring an outside box, is nice (especially compared to the slow and clunky Sony Blu-ray player).The quality of Netflix movies, though, is the deal maker on this TV.  As someone else mentioned, HBO, Starz, et al should feel threatened.  I have not bought 3D glasses--and at $200 a pair, I think I'll wait until there is some really compelling content available.  Maybe a full time 3D channel, at the very least.Conclusion:  Two thumbs up for this extraordinary home theater machine!  This is my second Vizio TV, the first being a 19\" that doubles as a monitor for my file server.  So far, Vizio quality is impressive.  Only time will tell about the longevity.Update May 2011.  Vizio seems to lag in getting new Internet apps, other than the junk apps.  Hulu Plus is on Roku.  Even ultra-lame Sony has Hulu Plus.  Vizio says it is coming and will be downloaded to the TV automatically--they said that four months ago, and I'm still waiting.  Thinking about getting a Roku box to use with this TV.

Ramos", "ReviewID": "R2EJXNLUYVEHO9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this set for about a week. I purchased it because at the time the non-3D version was almost the same price and was not being shipped from Amazon. I really was not interested in the 3D and have not seen it in action. This review is just on the 2D capabilities. I read all the reviews on Amazon and went to Cnet, etc. to see what people were saying about this and the 2D set. I didn't know what blooming was so there was a bit of a learning curve. I read about sets shutting off and being returned. The following is my experience so far.The initial setup was relatively easy. I had read over at another site that Smart Dimming is off by default so I found the option and turned it on. I had a little trouble with the remote's auto device setup and my cable box, but I spaced out and chose Cox as the manufacture of my device instead of Scientific Atlantic. Once I did that I was able to find the exact code I needed to use my Vizio remote to replace most functions of my cable box remote. When the keyboard is slid out the Vizio remote does feel a little weak, but it is still a cool design.Visually, this set is quite stunning. I had a couple friends check it out and one of them is more of a video/audiophile then I could ever be. He helped me run it through the paces game wise using Little Big Planet 2 and Halo Reach. There was no lag detected. I played Avatar, Final Fantasy: Advent Children and Star Trek on BluRay from a PS3 and it looked great. I was really curious to see how Star Trek would look since the whole movie has tons of lens flare. My cable box is only 1080i connected over HDMI and it still looks pretty good. As for blooming, I did notice some moderate blooming when I was not viewing from the center of the screen and there was a bright white text on a black background. It is mostly seen when viewing from off angles. I didn't consider it to ruin my movie experience at all.I have been running my set quite a bit this last week to see if I had this shutdown issue I had read about. I ran into a bit of a scare. My set would run for about 30 minutes and then the screen would freeze for about 2 seconds and then shut off. I tried disconnecting the power for 15 minutes and then reconnecting it. Still had the problem. I hadn't really timed it, but the shutdowns seemed fairly evenly spaced. I had an idea that it could be possible that the TVs sleep timer was set. I checked and it was set to off. I fiddled with the settings changing it to 190 minutes and then back to off. Since then, I have not had the set shutdown on its own. I will still keep an eye on it, but it looks good so far.Overall, if this set continues to run I will be 100% happy with my purchase. From what I have seen from other reviews, even if I did have a hardware problem there would not be an issue getting it replaced. I plan on checking out the 3D side of this set this week. I will be curious to see how it looks.Edited 2/16/2011 - The self power downs continued. I preformed a factory reset and abstained from loading any additional widgets. I even deleted some I just did not care about. The shutdowns did seem to start after I had installed some widgets, but perhaps they are not related. Since the reset the set has remained on and no further shutdowns! The shutdowns might be software related which would be great news as it is easier to fix then a hardware problem.I tried out the 3D using the Vizio brand glasses. The picture was good, but I noticed Smart Dimming is automatically turned off when in 3D mode. This added some bright areas in dark scenes. I watched Alice in Wonderland on Blu-Ray 3d and Dispicable Me from my cable provider. The Blu-Ray 3D seemed a bit sharper. Overall, the 3D performance was similar as what I see in most theaters. There is an adjustment as with in the theaters, but that goes away after a while.I am extremely pleased with my TV's performance, but I don't believe I should have to troubleshoot it quite so much. Still happy with my purchase, but I will be dropping it down to 4 stars.Edited 3/2/2011 - My Vizio still remains strong after the factory reset and the continued minimal widget installation. Since my last update I have tested out even more 3D sources such as Vudu and games from my PS3. I am glad I have the option of 3D even though it wasn't my initial intent. Great TV. If you are on the fence about Vizio like I was, I would recomend giving it a shot.

It's as good or better than any 3D TV you might find at twice the price.THE EDITORIAL:  For those of you who wonder if 3D TV is a gimmick.. it's not.  It is very cool, very engaging, and you will get used to it.  It's just that 3D content is ridiculously expensive right now.  So, if you need a TV now to handle all the eye-popping 2D HD content that is affordable (DVD, Blu-ray, broadcast, cable or internet), and simultaneously get a flavor for that magical future.. look no further than this VISIO.OUR SET-UP:  We are set up with a PS3 and a few Blu-ray 3D titles, which have demonstrated that that will do a competent job on 3D.  But I will not be building a hard library of 3D content until disk-based media gets down to $15 for prime stuff, $4 for I Love Lucy Season 7, and full 1080p SBS or TB @ 240 Hz. Presumably this is a 480 Hz capable TV, which will look great when the media is ready.  Cable and internet options are not useful.  No fault of the TV, but Comcast only offers two 3D channels in my area, and the resolution is not up to the capabilities of the TV.  All in all, you are buying the promise of a better future, for not a lot of coin, before the genre is really ready for prime time.  Be proud, you are among the \"early adopters\".SOFT FEATURES:  Conceptually, VISIO has a good idea for an app-like interface between the internet and the TV.  I like apps on the iPhone.  But who is doing the development for VISIO?  And how much will new apps cost?  None of the apps that came with the TV are compelling, and none are essential.  Quite frankly, if you are making an investment in 3D, you've probably got (or will get) a gaming system that already delivers the basics and more; or you will have a laptop with an HDMI output.  Do you need apps that deliver Netflix on the TV?  Not if you have a Playstation.  How about VUDU, YouTube, etc?  There is a healthy competition between games consoles, laptops, and add-on devices for the \"best\" user interface, and I'm afraid the TV falls short.  This TV is not an internet appliance, it doesn't even have a competent browser.INTERFACE(S)  Great.. lots of options to get stuff into the TV.  HDMI on the side and in the back.  Down-facing angled inputs.. brilliant!!  USB on the side.. you can plug in a thumb drive and just run a continuous .jpg slide show.  However, the slideshow app is a joke  Only two screen time options, and not one of the \"transitions\" are useful. I just let it go from pic to pic. Come on, app folks!GLASSES:  On the plus side.. I don't mind the glasses.  The work as advertised; active shutter, fairly comfy, they're not heavy, they hold the charge, and I am not trying to make a fashion statement while watching TV.  If you are conceptually opposed to glasses, it is rumored that a no-glasses 3D TV is coming somewhere down the road.  If you can wait, you should wait.  On the minus side: I had to buy the glasses separately from the TV.  Some other sets offer 2 or more pair in the box.  To make this a reasonable package deal, Amazon offered a heavy discount (i.e. nearly free) on the first 2 pair of glasses.  This solidified VISIO's first place with respect to value.  I'll buy more when the prices drop (as they should..).REMOTE:  This is a huge disappointment.  It was supposed to be innovative, with the slide out keyboard, but it's not useful.  If you want to text your friends or search the web, get a laptop or an iPhone.  This TV will do neither, and after the first day you are only using the outer function buttons.  And here is the real disappointment..  Tiny little black buttons, with tinier little white lettering painted on the black keys, no backlighting, and 2 years down the road when the letters have abraded off, you'd best hope you have them memorized.  It is a throwback to the '80s.  I already need reading glasses.  In a dark room, with this remote, (and the 3D glasses on), it's all Braille.  As soon as I have identified a good all-in-one home theater unifying remote with all the VISIO codes, I'll switch.PICTURE QUALITY (2D):  THis is why you should buy the VISIO.  The picture is Outstanding. It is vibrant, the presets out of the box are useful and intuitive, and they're not hard to tweak.  Once you've got your favorites, and all your inputs are set up, you will just turn it on and love it.  My tweaks.. I have the set in a fairly dark room.  For a couple of presets, at first I had some slow moving horizontal waves.  Not really noticeable until a dark screen shot.  The cause: brightness and backlight were way higher than they needed to be.  A little tuning and the waves are gone.PICTURE QUALITY (3D)  Just fine.  Like I said, Competent.  I had previewed all the 55\" options at the big-box stores.  This convinced me that active shutter really does provide the best picture.  Not surprisingly, it is BETTER than you get at the local movieplex with the cast-off 3D glasses.  And isn't this why you want a 3D system in your home?  The switching from 2D to 3D is a little clumsy, but VISIO made it easier by strategically placing the only button you really need in a very prominent position on the remote (Hey, VISIO.. give that designer a bonus.)55\"  What's not to like?MADE IN AMERICA  OK, I should have got this up in the editorial comments, but really, folks.. we CAN buy a TV that is manufactured in the USA... it is VISIO.  Unlikely that all components are sourced here, but remember that every dollar we put into the local manufacturing economy generates 3 to 5 dollars of recession-busting, job  creating, stimulating, politics free, circulating economic activity that enhances the public sector, the private sector... and it really looks good in your living room.  Made in America.  The three legs of economic security are locally made, locally distributed and locally banked.  Whenever you can, look for the label \"Made in America\"  It matters.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "For the price a Great 55\" LED 3d TV", "Author": "Brent T.

I have had this TV for about 5 weeks but I just finally put it up 2 weeks ago.  I mounted it to my wall in my family room.  I used a cheetah bracket and it worked well. It is a pretty heavy TV for an LED.  It is also a whole lot thicker (depth) then a lot of LED I have seen.  We have a 55\" non 3d TV here at work that is an LG Brand and it is really thin.Anyways TV looks good on my wall but the room the TV is in is rather big.  Like 25 x 30 sized room.  So the tv doesn't really stand out to much.After messing with settings on the TV i got the TV looking a whole lot better than the default settins.  When you first turn the TV on you say to yourself \"why is it so dull?\"  After messing with some of the settings it really makes the TV look as good as the Sony Bravia xbr LCD it replaced.There is also a power saving or time savings feature (i don't know the exact name of it seeing I am at working doing this review and not at home) but you must shut that off.  It keeps the TV so dull it kind of makes you want to send it back.I also haven't tried the 3D feature seeing I don't have the 3d glasses no care to really get them at this point.  The reason I bought this TV is that my room is rather large, I have small children so I didn't want to spend a lot on a tv seeing they throw things around the house and might break something, and i got a deal from amazon with the store card and for the next two years i only have to spend like 50 bucks a month no interest.  So with those factors in mind.  I really dig this TV.Are there better ones out there?  Yes I am sure there are but with those things in mind I like this TV and once I found out there was going to be an NFL season.

That being said, I am very pleased with my decision to purchase this TV.  I looked at about 25 different models ranging between 47\" and 55\".  I think for the money this was a really good decision.  Especially since I see that you can get it for about $300 less than when I bought mine.  The picture quality is really good and I love watching BlueRay movies.  The 3D is a feature I never thought I wanted or would use at home but I find watching movies with it is cool.  My kid loves it becasue it really is like being at the theater.  And for the price of this TV it was easy to say OK to the extra expense for the 3D model.  I've had no ghosting issues with this that some poeple complain about and the remote is fun and easy to use.  I do wish the main keys were backlit but that is my only grip about the remote.  I love the VIA but wish Vizio had YouTube and Hulu on this model.  I expected it becasue several pieces of the sales lit had them listed but maybe its only on other models right now.

This is my first Vizio TV.Wow...lol. My Samsung was 60Hz, so getting this TV I was blown away by the Smooth Motion settings and other settings in the Advanced Picture settings. I thought the \"soap opera\" effect only worked with Blu Ray content, lol. It works with standard def content too. And more than the soap opera effect, it looks like a real clear home movie too. I agree when some ppl say it is weird at times looking at it.  But coming from my Samsung, I love it. And if it is too weird for you, you can always adjust the settings until you get the TV how you want it. It does look like the soap opera effect isnt as bad as one TV I saw in Circuit City when they had retail stores. Maybe the technology has gotten better. But compared to my Samsung from 3 years ago thats 60Hz and didnt have this type of setting, I can tell the difference right away.About the Smooth Motion and advanced settings: I dont know what it is but my standard def channels looks better on here than my Samsung. Is it because my Samsung was 60Hz? Is it the Smooth Motion settings and other settings in this Vizio? Is it because its more up to date than my Samsung? My Samsung is a very old TV by todays standards. Whatever the case, this Vizio is amazing.The viewing angles. I found out the hard way about that in 2008. I also had a 26\" Samsung that had terrible viewing angles. My 46\" has amazing viewing angles. So does this Vizio. Even with 3D its nice. You dont have to sit square in the middle of the TV to still see the 3D effects. Of course its better watching 3D straight on, but that fact you can even still see it off center and it doesnt mess up is amazing. Compared to my 26\", the 26\" would look black even a lil off center. I couldnt even lay down in bed and watch my 26\" sitting on my dresser good. My dresser was higher than my bed. Both my 46\" Samsung and the Vizio has real nice viewing angles. I got my 46\" Samsung on that dresser now and am so happy.Switching inputs is alot faster with this Vizio.Only thing I dont like is I wish it was thinner like some of the other LED TV's. I was able to put it up on an entertainment center by myself but I like to move alot and want the moving to be as easy as possible.

I love the menus, very easy to use. I got a Samsung 3D Blu-Ray player and the Blu-Ray picture is 100% perfect. Even the built in sound is good. I decided to leave it on along with my surround sound. Viewing the screen from all angles is even good.3D: Once in a while there is some ghosting on some of the items in a scene. For instance, I was watching Despicable Me. Some times the zipper on his jacket would be ghosted. Some times just a small thing like a glass or other small item in the scene. In one scene a character came towards the screen, we could tell it was done for the 3D effect, we got no effect. It was kinda blurry. Other than those things, even in 3D, this TV has a great picture and the 3D quality was really good and clear. Just an occasional ghosting.To try and clear up the ghosting issue, I tried a different cable that I already used the PS3 on, still ghosted. With that cable using the PS3 I played Black Ops. Perfect 3D like the movie, with a touch of ghosting. So, it's not the player, not the movie, not the game and not the PS3. Either it's the quality of their glasses, the TV 3D output or 3D TVs just aren't quite there yet.Number of times we noticed ghosting in the movie: probably about 15 times, each only for a second or two.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superb 55 inch TV!", "Author": "TOM8PIE", "ReviewID": "R2D5MAUJBWMKON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Buying from Amazon:  This is the second large television that we've ordered from Amazon... and, I must say, we are very pleased indeed.  The first television that we ordered years ago had only two bad pixels, and they turned to good pixels in time. This new 55 inch Vizio that we ordered had 0 bad pixels.  One can't complain about that!  Many tv outlets won't accept a return unless you have 9 or more bad pixels.  Anyway, we are very satisfied with purchasing from Amazon.Setup:  It arrived on a Tuesday; my wife was home; I was at work.  My brother-in-law and his family from Texas were coming by to visit us later that evening.  Well I had the whole thing working perfectly (including in 3D) in the very short time that I had to get the set ready. They were blown away by the wonderful picture quality, by the way!2D:  2D with this set is the best I've seen, period!  The deepest blacks, superb contrast and perfect color saturation! We love it!  This set, keep in mind, is very similar to the VIZIO XVT553SV 55-Inch Class Full Array TruLED with Smart Dimming LCD HDTV 240 Hz; however, it has the wonderful 3D capacity that its sister set does not. If you are thinking about getting this set, read the rave reviews about the  XVT553SV 55-Inch set; it has a lot of folks stating how very splendid it is.  Unlike most LED televisions, these sets from Vizio use full LED backlighting, not the more commonly used cheaper and less efficient edge (periphery) LED lighting that most LED sets get by with. That is why, with this set, you get such deep blacks and such rich colors.Energy efficiency:  This set uses less electricity and puts out a lot less heat than do large sized plasma sets.  For its size, it is more environmentally friendly than many regular LED sets.Screen Glossiness:  It's there alright; but for us, it is not a problem at all.  I suppose if one had extremely bright lighting at an ineffaceable angle, one would have to reposition the light source or set. It's something to reflect on... but it's a minor flaw in regard to a fabulous set.3D:  We've been into 3D for many years, way longer than most.  I used to make 3D holograms with lasers... and we religiously went to 3D IMAX movies way back, many years ago, way before it became in vogue.  I also used to have a gaming 3D virtual reality helmet when I was young.  The 3D is really excellent.  A little bit of ghosting here and there, in the splendid movies we've watched, but just a negligible amount. Some of the movies, like Open Season, look better in 3D on the Vizio than they did at the theater. I've seen 3D plasma sets at the local Electronics Outfits and I do not like their imaging as well as LED.  The plasmas have too much graininess and just aren't as good with contrast and detail, as far as I'm concerned.  I've played a couple of 3D games which I downloaded with my PlayStation 3, and they are very sweet when played with this set in 3D.  The game Wipeout HD had some ghosting, while the game Super Stardust HD did not... which is interesting; both of these downloadable 3D games were a lot of fun.  I bought a pair of Vizio Slim Design Ultra High Speed HDMI cables (labeled as being for LED and as being 240Hz ready); these work very well with this set.  Tip:  If you will be playing movies and games via a PlayStation 3, make sure that (under System Settings) you adjust the tv parameters such that it is set for a 55 inch screen (and, of course, for 1080p and all the other resolution settings); this will help with any possible ghosting.  Sometimes ghosting is due to problems with the encoding itself within the media you are watching.Other Parameters:  I took the advice of other reviewers of this set and used \"Movie Mode\" as the default for this set.  Movie mode works just great... and looks just right for us.  This makes for realistic imaging without that fake, bright, regular old tv appearance.  It's easy on the eyes and it is a joy to watch!Overall:  We are more than glad that we got it!!!  p.s.- It's made in the U.S.A.Update--- 8/29/11:  We continue to be very thrilled with this television.  We've purchased a very large quantity of 3D DVDs... and ghosting is simply not evident in most all of them. None of the major films, such as by Disney, DreamWorks, or Columbia Pictures, have any significant ghosting whatsoever. I cannot emphasize enough that many LED televisions do not have full LED backlighting like this Vizio set does; that is why the 2D and 3D images and colors look significantly better with this Vizio model.  Backlighting is vastly superior to the much more common (and cheaper to make) edge lighting.

I did not want to deal with customer support and all that, so I just had Amazon send me the same TV again.Not so many problems the first month, but then one day, the TV just turned off. Crap. So it has only randomly turned off a couple times, but the newer TV seems to have a few more problems of it's own.

At first glance the reflection in any model with a glossy screen at Sam's or Costco seemed to be a problem.  I'd had experience with both flat screen CRTs and rear projection screens where the image was hard to see in daylight, and reflected a lamp shade and other features of the room at night.  The 553 thus seemed like a wiser choice, at first glance, for most viewing conditions.On the other hand the high end videophile screens are apparently all glossy.  From of all I have read, I assume that the gloss screens scatter the light coming out of the screen less, and therefore give a sharper image, and deeper blacks in dark details of the image.  A matte screen would presumably scatter the light coming out of the screen around more, muddling, I assume, details of the image and lightening dark details.  Based on this buying the matte 553 would have meant sacrificing the home theater experience in favor of having no or few reflections most of the time, bothered me.  I continued delaying the purchase, waiting for some review or new development to make the decision.A little before the \"free\" pair of 3D glasses were thrown in to the deal I had come upon another observation about matte vs glossy that slanted me toward the glossy.  This was the clencher actually:  The reflections in a glossy screen are comprehensible to the brain only when your eyes are focused at the distance of the reflected objects(which are at various distances away from the screen PLUS the distance from eye to screen), and so get deleted when your eyes are focused at the distance of the screen.  Choosing to watch the image rather than the reflections deletes them to a large degree, if you just watch the screen.The human brain and eye physiology does a better job to some extent than the matte screen does, at removing reflections of objects from the experience.  The matte screen presents reflections as diffuse blobs of light right at the distance of the screen, mixing the image with the reflections, making it impossible for the brain and eye to separate image from noise in the far more intelligent way they are capable of doing.So this is my justification of why the glossy 554 was the right way to go, vs the matte 553.  Except for some particularly bright room conditions the glossy screen is a better choice, and the 554 has additional features beyond those of the 553.  Presumably the engineers were able to incorporate learning from the earlier 553 model which constitute improvements in reliability, firmware and such, on top of the improved frequency specs and 3D processing.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE THE 3D", "Author": "aatom", "ReviewID": "RF2AU7IIS3NL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this now for a couple weeks.

What's not to like?  It took forever to find the right picture settings, since the factory defaults looked bad (colors all wrong).  Compared side-by-side with a comparably priced Samsung (UN55D6000), the picture isn't as clear.  This TV's styling isn't very nice looking either.  The high contrast ratio and fast frame rate just don't make that much difference.  Plus the screen is really reflective, which tends to negate the high dynamic contrast.  To be fair though, most TVs have reflective screens now.  On the plus side, the picture is almost as good as a Samsung (most people won't notice a difference), and once you get the settings adjusted, this TV is better than almost any other.  Even with the Smooth Motion feature turned off, there's very little motion blur.  The Wi-Fi works great and is easy to set up.  Cable TV tuning is fast, and it's easy to switch between video sources.  On the whole, this is a pretty good TV and I'm not returning it.  I would definitely recommend that you also consider the Samsung, especially if you have good eyesight and value basic picture quality over all the bells and whistles that this unit offers (3D, great internet connectivity, fancy remote).  Too bad there isn't more 3D programming available.Update after two months: The picture is still good, but the unit has turned itself off twice in the last week, and there was another incident where it stopped responding to remote control commands and shortly thereafter the picture flashed on and off repeatedly.  I had to unplug it and wait for a while.  After power was re-applied, the VIZIO logo rapidly flashed on and off for about a minute, and then the TV worked fine.  One more spontaneous turn-off and I'm contacting the warranty service.

I wanted top image quality without going to Plasma.  I loved DLP, but the brightness wasn't competitive anymore and I was finally ready to go up to 1080p.This set comes as close to plasma as you can -- the blacks are amazing (thanks to local dimming... as long as you aren't really far off axis -- but really, how often do you sit and watch the TV from odd angles?), the brightness is amazing, and the colors are unbelievable.  The default calibration is a little off as mentioned before, but I'm pretty happy with only minor changes from movie mode.  Glossy finish maybe isn't ideal, but it's the norm these days, and when I compared glossy to a 2 year-old unit with matte finish in the store, I was shocked there wasn't a huge difference in reflective glare.  I run without the motion smoothing because it annoys me, but mostly because it's just too good for my eyes.  Others will find it to be awesome.  So far, I haven't noticed problems with true 1080/24 content. *EDIT* My player was set to not send 24fps, so I enabled that.  With one disc I tried it introduced some oddness.  Will keep trying and report back.Response times are great with gaming, as long as you enable gaming mode which turns off the processing.  Don't know why the other reviewer had an issue.Inability to directly stream DLNA (or even via the USB, I think) is one minor low light, but my BD player fills in the gap nicely.  Netflix is definitely way better on the Xbox, but I bought the TV as a display, not for the VIA apps.Remote is not as bad as some say.  The keyboard is nice, and you can program it via the TV as a universal remote.  How many remotes can do that?  But, I already have a much better universal, so I only use this as a backup.3-D mode is one major lowlight if you're considering the TV for that reason alone.  I have done demos with Panasonic plasmas and been amazed.  But so far, LED-LCD doesn't seem to do as good with 3-D.  This TV is no exception.  Too much cross-talk.  I think if you could turn down the brightness in 3-D mode, it would help a lot, but alas, you cannot.  I have the Vizio glasses.  Another problem is that the IR sync is constantly breaking if anything gets in the way or the angle gets too far off axis.  *EDIT* - I have read some reviews and think that it may be my content selections thus far.  If someone knows where to get some \"reference\" 3-D material, I will happily review and revise this accordingly.Overall, the set can't be beat for the sale price I got it for.  There may be better sets, but they're plasma and/or considerably more expensive.  As long as 3-D isn't something you really must have the best of, I think this is a great buy for the price.

We boxed it up and drove 40 minutes back to the store to exchange.  #2, hooked up by midnight (I will say that set up was easy). The clarity of the HD picture is amazing!  As for the remote, we like that it feels like a QWERTY slider cell phone.  We thought it was easy to use.  But that's about where the positives end.  Internet connection had to be hardwired.  From the minute it was turned on we could see two areas of dead pixels (each one about 2 x 2 inches), one dead center.  But the most noticeable deal breaker was the same as Andrew S. Lamott:  \"one of the backlit LED array zones went dim. (it's on the left side, 2nd section, of 5, down from the top) Looks like a cloud is over that part of the picture.\"  I'm not sure what size a \"zone\" is but the area that is \"clouded\" is approximately one foot high by a half foot wide on the left side of the screen.  There are also a number of other cloudy spots around the outside close to the frame.  It is a shame because there are so many desirable features on this television that we never got a chance to try.

The menus are all pretty clear and easy to navigate. I'm not making use of the 3D capability, so I can't comment on that. I have used the built-in Netflix app, and I'm very impressed. It allows browsing through available titles, whereas most other devices that support Netflix streaming restrict you to selecting items from your instant queue. The quality is also excellent (using a wired connection). Oh, also a nifty feature: if you are watching episodes of a series, it will keep track of which one you watched last and automatically queue up the next one. That's a major time saver now that Netflix keeps all the episodes of a series under a single heading, instead of arranging them by season like they used to.I noticed that a lot of people complain about the remote, and I was a little concerned because I could not find any information on whether the TV would accept a signal from an IR remote. I'm happy to report that it does. There's an IR sensor on the lower left corner, and it works great with my Logitech Harmony remote. So I don't have to use the included remote unless I want to enter text with the keyboard. I do agree with the general consensus that the included remote is uncomfortable to hold, and feels a little cheap due to the slide-out keyboard mechanism being very loose. But it's usable, and having that qwerty keyboard is kind of handy for some of the apps.One thing that surprised me is how long it takes for the TV to start up. About 10 seconds. On reflection, I guess that's not too unreasonable. It's technically a computer, and it takes a little time to boot up.Delivery was okay. It shipped and arrived at the local delivery firm quickly. They called as soon as they received it, and scheduled a day for delivery. My only gripes are that they would not give me a time window until the evening before, and then they showed up about 10 minutes early. The delivery guys were about to leave when I pulled into the driveway (still a few minutes early). They opened the box, plugged it in and turned it on to make sure it worked before leaving. Of course, this experience will probably vary widely depending on who is contracted for local delivery.All things considered, I think this TV is an amazing value for the price.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Irishman", "ReviewID": "R1AE1F57OYVG73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The XVT3d554ST is fantastic.

I replaced a 36\" standard 4:3 TV with this 55\" beauty.First the positives:1)The picture is absolutly outstanding in 2D High Definition and with 10 million:1 contrast ratio the images are acute2) Superior 480 Hz refresh rate. I watch sports ~75% of the time and there is virtually no smearing in fast motion. This was the primary criterion for my selection and I am certainly not disappointed.3) Full Array local SmartDimming feature works great. It's bright enough in daylight to clearly see everything yet dims well when the room is pitch black.4) SRS TruSound\u00ae (sound leveling between show and commercials) works well while on the same station but unfortunatly not while changing from one channel to the next5) 180\u00b0 viewing angle. They aren't off much there. Even with 3D, the viewing angle is great.6) VIA - Visio Internet Applications. Although this is low on my scale of priorities, it is cool.The negatives:1) The glare from lighting is more than I imagined it might be (and I was expecting some based on other reviews). There really isn't much difference between this unit and a plasma in that regard.2) 3D viewing is not great. I have a Vizio Blu-Ray 3D and Directv. While the crossover(ghosting)isn't quite as noticable with the Blu-Ray, Directv is to the point of annoyance.3) When viewing standard definition I have vertical or horizontal \"line\" either on the extreme top and/or bottom or on one side of the screen.4) there are intermittent times where the sound doesn't sync (off by a fraction of a second \u00b1) It may be ahead or behind depending on the show so adjustment is nearly impossible.5) I too will mention the remote. Although the bluetooth is nice, it's way too limiting and \"simple\". I ended up programming my Directv remote to my TV and sound with my JVC tuner.6)Here's the one RED FLAG. I've owned the set for a couple months and it has shut down and restarted 3 or 4 times in that period. At this point it is merely a nuisance but it may have underlying issues. I will attempt to keep you updated.In summary, If 3D as your primary purpose of purchase I would suggest something else, but if your focus is on outstanding picture quality and clarity in motion particularly in HD(2D)this set will not disappoint you.3.5 stars out of 5", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superb  video quality", "Author": "albert alberto", "ReviewID": "R3ATEW4F2N8MJN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The video quality with 480hz is amazing. real nice features.I LOVE IT.

Had never purchased a flat screen before so felt very lost with all of the info available out there.  After going around to several merchants, I found that 55\" would be the best size and after reviewing other options for a 55\" 2D and 3D, found that Costco's seemed to be the best bargain available for the features it offers 55\". 480 Hz, 3D, etc...  Didn't need a fancy TV.  Just one that had great sound and clear picture.  For only $100 more plus a free pair of 3D glasses, I chose the 3D version just in case we ever decided to use the option and then lucked out in getting the floor model and saving another $125 so ended up paying less than the 2D version and got a free pair of glasses.  I do realize a \"bargain\" is not always the greatest thing so was concerned that once I got it home and hooked up, it would disappoint me but knew I could return it to Costco easily if it did.  However, I was far from disappointed.  It surprised me in a very positive way. I find my self sitting in front of it saying \"WOW, this is amazing\".Clarity and Sound:It is the first new and first flat screen I've purchased and am thrilled with the quality, clarity and sound.  After reading reviews on flat screen TVs, I thought I might have to hook it up to a sound system to get decent sound but didn't.  Even on very low volume, it has great sound.Great Value:Worth it and would buy another if local Costco had any left:Since I bought it from Costco, their warranty is great so if this set does have any of the issues I've read about from a few other reviewers, Costco will ensure all is settled.  They have been amazing in the past with other items.  If our local Costco had another one, I would buy it for my basement.

It was by far the best picture of any TV they had on display and, frankly, it remains the best 2D picture I've seen anywhere to date.My family and I continue to love this TV and we've had absolutely no problems of any kind.  However, I do have a complaint with an important feature omission, that being Audio Return Channel (ARC) functionality.  WTH would Vizio bring to market such a fantastic 55\" TV with their heavily promoted Vizio Internet Apps, but fail to provide the capability to output audio for those Apps, e.g., Netflix, by any means except two underwhelming 15W built-in speakers?  Evidently, Vizio did not consider that customers paying a lot of money for their TV might actually want to output ALL audio to their home theater setup!  It makes absolutely no sense to have Apps with no ARC.  Because of this problem, we instead use Blue Ray player apps, rendering Vizio Apps a complete waste.I've twice contacted Vizio about this shortcoming, most recently on Independence Day.  Was told there was no timeframe for when/if this feature might be available via firmware auto-update feature.  The first time I contacted them, I was told the feature would be available via HDMI#1, if/when it ever was rolled out.Still waiting for ARC...and doubting Vizio will ever address it.Update 7/23/11:  A toslink cable out from the TV to your receiver will work for surround sound, if your setup and aesthetics will allow it, but ours doesn't. I have the TV mounted over my fireplace and my Integra receiver, blue ray, etc., on an adjacent wall. Our surround sound cables and HDMI are run in-wall. So, for us, the Toslink cable is not a tenable option.  Regardless, it's still rather ridiculous to not have HDMI-based ARC on a TV of this quality and be stuck with running another cable.Update 9/3/11:  Great news!  Vizio pushed out a firmware update this week, VIZIO_XP2.7.9.1, which INCLUDES ARC and some new widgets, USB port functionality, etc.  Strangely, VIZIO does not post firmware update notes on their website.

Had a 3D Blu-ray player, 1.4 HDMI Cable and Vizio  3D glasses and a 3D movie.  Well the 3D does not work.  There is just too much framing around this TV also.  If you are using an external receiver like I am you do not need to have that big Vizio speaker at the bottom of the Tv.  My receiver is also 3D capable.I liked the remote.  A lot of people dogged the remote and I thought it was very good.  Ok not for the smooth tweaking stuff.  I tweaked my set and and it the words that run off the screen from the movie credits were not too shabby.  They still are not totally stable.  Tweaking and smooth motion help alot but it still shakes.Don't buy this set for the 3D you will be sorry.  I went with the PN58C8000 that blows this set to pieces.  Plasma in my opinion is better then a full array of LED, LCD or and LED set.The only reason to buy a LED is because you want to cut down on your electric bill.  So you only use 150 watts vs 250 watts.  Big deal.Another thing I did not like about the Vizio is that you can not update the software on it.  There is not feature that lets you check and download the latest software.For a price over $2000 buy a  Sam sung.  This set is only worth it when the price drops less then $1500.Experience with Amazon was amazing.  The had my defective set pickup and issue me a full refund.

For all these reasons I do not recommend purchasing this TV despite the price, better pay a little more for a better product, I already lost my money because i buy from amazon but I brought it to my country, then returning it is very expensive. I have to watch normal tv and keep watching my movies with my samsung 3D active glassesHola, yo compre este televisor de 3D, pensando que era una maravilla ya que utiliza las mismas gafas polarizadas que las de los cines y pense, ahora ya puedo invitar a varios amigos a ver mis peliculas en 3D, sin embargo tiene multiples fallas por eso no recomiendo comprar este tv.- a veces se apaga solo sin ningun motivo, que me parace lo mas grave.- para poder ver medio bien en 3D se debe ubicar la vista por encima del nivel del televisor, es decir que no se puede colgar en la pared si uno quiere ver peliculas en 3D.- En muchas ocasiones la conexion a 3D se pierde y el blu-ray no lo reconoce como tv 3D, y el boton de 3D no sirve para resolver este problema, toca apagar todo , desconectarlo y volverlo a conectar, a ver si tienes suerte de que funcione.- Los videos que se ven por internet se ven muy mal y salen multiples rallas vesticales en la pantalla mientras se reproducen, tengo un samsung 3D y nada de lo anterior ocurre en este.- Otra falla grave es que tengo varios canales HD y al pasar de canales normales a canales HD aparecen unas rallas verticales todo el tiempo no importa que canal HD este viendo.- O casi lo olvido, el control remoto es de lo peor, en micasa hay 5 tv pero ninguno tiene un control tan malo como el de este tv, hay que oprimir supremamente furte los botones para que el control responda y como los botones son tan pequenos imaginen el problema, es mas comodo comprar un control remoto universal para la funciones basicas.- Ahora tras 5dias de uso el tv se apaga despues de 5 o 8 segundos de prendido, para que se quede prendio toca prenderlo y entrar al menu inmediatamente para que no se apague y aun asi no siempre funciona.- Yo conpre el modelo de 32 pulgadas de 3d pero cuando conecto el portatil al tv via HDMI el computador lo detecta como si fuera un tv de 42 pulgadas, el sorfware de esto equipos es terrible, definitivamente lo barato sale muy caro despues.Por todo lo anterior no recomiendo para nada adquirir este tv a pesar del precio, mejor pague un poco mas por un mejor producto, yo ya perdi mi dinero, porque lo compre en amazon pero lo traje para mi pais, entonces sale muy caro devolverlo, me queda para ver tv normal y seguir viendo mis peliculas 3D con mi samsung de gafas activas.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "BUYERS BEWARE:  DO NO BUY A VIZIO!!!", "Author": "Khoi Dang", "ReviewID": "R1PE3N5S0XG003", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "BUYERS BEWARE:  DO NO BUY A VIZIO!!!  Vizio TV's are cheap, and they appear to give you the biggest bang for your buck, but they simply to no work as promised.  I purchased a Vizio XVT553SV which, at the time, was their flagship model.  Immediately, it had video artifacts/flickering on every input (Dish, PS3, media player).  Vizio's website even admits to this and promises that a firmware update and clean storage procedure would fix this!!! Vizio updated the firmware, and the issue appeared to be resolved for a few weeks, but then returned.  Vizio customer support had me do a power recycle, which resolved the issue for a few weeks, but, again the issues returned and new ones appeared - the video would freeze upon a cold start-up, the TV would turn off automatically in the middle of watching TV for no reason whatsoever. Vizio technical support had me do clean storage procedure which appeared to resolve the issue for a few days, but then the issues again returned.  Technical support  also admitted that the issue of the TV turning off intermittently will still be an issue until Vizio updates the firmware and they are looking into this issue now.  Through these issues, we could still watch TV - the issues were merely a nagging nuisance.  Finally fed up and fearful that the TV would fail once out of the warranty period, I called Vizio and they sent out a Technician to replace the logic board.  Within an hour after the technician left, the TV failed altogether.  Vizio now wants to replace my new TV that was defective upon arrival with a recertified TV which I objected to.  In order to get a new TV, they want me to pay an extra $300.00 plus tax!  I asked \"Ashley\" of Vizio customer support how she would feel paying good money for a \"new\" TV, but instead, getting a recertified TV.  She said she would be upset but this is their corporate policy.  So, buy a Vizio at your own risk - because it is very risky to do so.  Incredible that Vizio would put out a product knowing that it had existing defects and then screwing customers over!!.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "54.64-inch diagonal TruLED LCD HDTV with 1080p resolution, full HD 3D, and VIZIO internet apps\nFull HD 3D immerses you in the action with high-definition 3D by VIZIO (active-shutter glasses sold separately)\nFull-array TruLED backlighting with Smart Dimming (120 zones) delivers realistic, vivid video with amazing contrast\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi connectivity with Internet Apps for access to Netflix, VUDU HD movies, Pandora internet radio, and more\n480Hz SPS Smooth Motion technology delivers 480 scenes per second, for clarity of fast action scenes and blur-free images", "Name": "VIZIO XVT3D554SV 55-inch 1080p 480Hz 3D LED HDTV with  Full Array TruLED, Smart Dimming and VIZIO Internet Apps", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417KADdKUHL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0045TYDXC"}}
