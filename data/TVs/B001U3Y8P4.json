The delivery service came at the time we scheduled and he set up everything for me.I loved this TV from the moment I turned it on. The picture is perfect, the menus are easy.My only not-good surprise was no optical-input.  That was solved by replacing the component cables & optical sound with a single HDMI cable - that is easier to hide anyway!", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture, Great Quality, Incredible Value", "Author": "Dennis B.", "ReviewID": "R2JKTRLFVUFGFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an incredible television.  You cannot beat this TV for the price.  The BAD REVIEW listed on this site is for a different Samsung TV so I am a little confused as to why it remains.  Do not let that bad review sway you from this purchase.  The black trim around the screen is shiny black but the screen is matte finish so if you have glare issues like I do, this TV is great.  The sound quality is just typical TV speaker quality; very little bass.  I bought a set of Sony Shelf speakers on this site for $49.00 and they sound awesome (hooked up through a tuner).  All my  electronics integrated perfectly with this TV.  You will be amazed at the quality of this TV and will ponder how you got such a great TV for the price.  If your worried about the 60hz, there is no noticeable difference between it and the 120hz.", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Quality is perfect.", "Author": "amazon_buyer", "ReviewID": "R3IO7YS6HE5FCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV, it was a refurbished deal and I use it as a computer monitor.

Williams \"BuyCheap\"", "ReviewID": "R3JJ4X5AJ36KEP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yes, there are some good reviews, but none that have had this TV for a long period of time. You can take the chance in buying, HOPING you won't get a DUD, but the chances are slim as I hear Samsung has not fixed this problem yet. I bought this from Walmart a week ago and the picture was beautiful, BUT THESE ARE KNOWN FOR THE BACKLIGHT GOING OUT and that is what mine did....A WEEK LATER! It is a circuit card that goes bad, and Samsung has never fixed them. I will NEVER buy a Samsung again. Looking at Sony now!UPDATE: I did buy another Samsung (I'm probably an idiot) from Crutchfield, and it is the LN52B630 model. It (Unlike this model) has 5 STARS (BUT I will say SAMSUNG CUSTOMER SUPPORT SUCKS!!!!!!). Pretty much the same TV, but updated, without all of the problems, more options, lighted remote, With an ETHERNET cable, you can get Stocks, weather and the latest news right on the TV screen, and so on. PLUS it is 120hz which gives a smoother picture! NICE OPTIONS, NICE PIC, and I will update later if it is NICELY built if it lasts. If it does not last, I am going straight to SONY!", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "the best", "Author": "Margarita M.

I was told I would be charged of return fee of 129.00 which I was willing to live with but I needed to return the tv. A few days later I get an email saying they are charging me 220.00 dollar return fee. When I called and asked them why they are charging me so much they just responded that was their return policy and there was nothing they would do. So I wrote a bad review about them and that's how I got a hold of Bruno who told me they would return the difference for me and sorry about the inconvenience. Well that was 2 weeks ago and I haven't even been able to get a hold of him never mind seen a penny of my money. They deal in shady business and I would not recommend you spend any money on their products.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Capacitor will break when your TV just past the warranty", "Author": "Jijun Zeng", "ReviewID": "R6IZZ5XJ3NC3E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Before you buy any Samsung LCD TV, please take a minute to check the link below:[...]I have the same problem after just 2years, spent $300 to replace the parts.
