{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Picture is great, but buzzes loudly.", "Author": "A. Niebruegge \"Selune\"", "ReviewID": "R3QP7WO0P5CBME", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this set for my father.  The picture quality is excellent, and even has video options for when you have a bad signal (it kind of smooths it out).  The colors are bright, text on-screen is crisp and straight (no slanting).  But, the bottom line is that the thing buzzes constantly.  It's extremely annoying.  You can't hear it if you turn the TV way up, but my father often listens to it at night when he has the volume down low, and the buzzing sounds really loud if there are no other sounds around.  Maybe it has something to do with being a flat screen, as I've heard there have been problems with flat screens and buzzing.  Don't know.  But, if buzzing sounds will bother you when trying to watch TV or a DVD, skip this sucker.", "Date": "February 11, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000HAS2AS"}}
