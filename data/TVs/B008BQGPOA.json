It arrived quickly, and the picture quality looked good.  After using it for less than 1 week, the picture went completely black.  The sound worked, but no picture.

Paid $207 shipped for each one so the deal was incredible and it allows me to use it as a monitor as well as a TV so this is a great space saver when you combine it with a low profile wall mount. Simple setup with HDMI inputs allowed for the TV to be up and running in no time at all. The 1080p image is clear and crisp. I have seen other 240hz 1080P TV's that don't match up in video quality. You do need to tweak the settings a bit to get the most out of the video but if you invest 3 minutes the image is a 8.5 out of 10 which is great for the price. The sound is the only downside as others have stated. I don't think that the sound would cut it in a larger living room but for a bedroom TV you really can't go wrong.Very happy with my purchase so far!", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with this TV!", "Author": "Coffee Drinker", "ReviewID": "R9CM95K2B5QGX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this about 3 months and couldn't be more pleased!

The replacement, received today, had the same problem. I tested the headphone jack on both TVs with multiple speaker sets and a headphone set.Since I'd planned to use a set of Bose PC speakers with the TV, to overcome the reported poor built-in speakers, this was quite irritating. I can confirm that the built-in speakers did work, but were as poor quality as reported elsewhere.When I received the original TV, the online 'chat' service person was unhelpful. But today, I reached a live Sceptre service person, who suggested using the RCA sound output instead. And, after buying the right cables ($6 here, but $12 at the local Radio Shack) it now works fine.Obviously, if you don't plan to use the headphone output, this problem doesn't matter. But, if you do, be sure to ALSO order an RCA to 3.5mm female cable, along with the TV. If you buy at the same time as the TV, you can get the cable you need for $3 - $6.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Recommended Low-End LCD", "Author": "Elliot Lear", "ReviewID": "R1WMAHH7ELHMBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A friend sent me the link to this TV during cyber monday week and I decided to take the plunge. I saw a few reviews talking about how the TV died shortly after they had received it, but figured for $180 and with Amazon's great return service, I would take the risk. I'm so glad I did!I've had it for a week and it's going strong, so I'm not sure if some of Sceptre's TVs were made incorrectly but are still in stock at Amazon? I guess just be aware that there are \"duds\" out there, but in my personal case, it's working fine. The screen is typical of an LCD system: if there's a lot of light in the room, it can be a bit too reflective. However, I usually watch the TV in the dark so it's not an issue, and even with some lights on, it's hardly that detrimental. Certainly nothing to quibble over at this price point.The 1080p is picture-perfect! I was a little hesitant about buying a TV online and not being able to preview the screen in store: as we all know, there are some TVs at 720p that look better than 1080p due to a variety of factors, so going to a brick and mortar can be helpful in choosing a set that meets customer standards. But there was no need to fear here, for the picture is clear and not too \"digitized.\" I also have a 46\" LG 1080p which out of the box required a lot of fiddling with picture quality settings to be watchable: the trigger sensing made all movies look ridiculous. Not so here. The TV also has a handy picture button on the remote, where one can cycle through power saving mode (the lowest light setting) to vivid for HD content. If I'm watching a BD, I set it to vivid; a DVD, power saving so that the up-converting isn't too obvious of lesser quality.The one down side? The headphone jack doesn't work. I know this was mentioned in another review, but when listening on headphones there's a loud, consistent hum. The sound quality on the set is pretty low quality, but still very listenable. I don't know what some people expect from the sound on a lowrange LCD, but this met expectations and is not overly tinny or hard to hear. It's simply not a high quality setup. I took the advice of another reviewer on the headphone issue, though: buy an RCA-3.5mm cable, plug the male end into the red and white audio outputs and your headphones into the female cable. Works like a charm.All in all, I'm very happy with the set and the price can't be beat. Though $179 made it impossible not to jump at this TV, even at its current price of $220 the Sceptre is a steal.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice overall", "Author": "Julian", "ReviewID": "R20NKXF4KRWT4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice TV it has 1080p and a great price point at 199 for a 32 inch.

Clark", "ReviewID": "R3VV87FW8TP3JX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW I know I said that already but that just keeps coming to mind when I think about this TV. I ordered this TV as a monitor first and as a TV second so I am very pleased as to what my new monitor looks like. I had brought a Samsung before on Black Friday for about 350 from Best Buy but was not happy with it for several reasons, one of the main ones is that it did not have a VGA port (OK blame me I did not check before I left the store). Nevertheless this one has one and as far as I am concerned it has just as good a picture as the Samsung. Another thing with the Samsung is that it only had 2 HDMI ports what a waste. But the main reason I am writing this review is because the picture was awful on the overpriced Samsung but on this 180 buck Sceptre it is all that I would want it to be . So if you are like I was looking for a cheaper TV to use as a monitor this might be just the trick for you and it is 1080p which is as well just what I was looking for. Oh let me say this as well the Samsung even at the price that it was did not have a swivel base but this one does so that is another major plus other than the price of course. I could go on all day talking about my new monitor but let me just say this, buy it and you will not be disappointed if you are like me you will be blown away as I was and still am. Now also I need say this I did buy the coverage plan because the one question that is still on my mind is how long will it last, I hope for more that the 3 years that the coverage plan covers but that part is still left to be seen. Oh that is right others are complaining about the sound well since I am using it as a monitor the sounds works great for me I even had the turn it down some so for me this TV is all good, buy two I know I wish I had!", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad.

When I saw this on Cyber Monday for $179, I couldn't NOT buy it. Now that I've tried it out, I can hardly believe what a good deal it was.How I use it: Currently it's connected to my laptop so I can watch videos/movies by using it as a 2nd monitor and still use my laptop screen at the same time. When I have a desktop computer and a computer desk, this 1080p TV and the 720p TV I already have will work as dual monitors.Image Quality: 1080p resolution is great because there's no noticeable pixelation even when using it as a computer monitor (which is not always true for 720p). The color is SUPERB. The color and brightness on this TV actually produce a prettier image than theater projectors IMO. And the blacks are DARK. When displaying black, it's hardly lighter than when turned off. It's also worth mentioning that the screen is lit extremely evenly. My 720p LED TV has a glow around the edges which is mostly noticeable when displaying a lot of black. On the Sceptre, every pixel is evenly lit with no distortion whatsoever.Sound: It doesn't sound like a speaker system, it sounds like a TV. My 720p Vizio is in the $350 range and has quality HD sound, but its also in another price/resolution category. At the time I'm writing this review, the Sceptre 1080p 32\" can be found on Walmart.com for $198. You can invest the extra $150 and get an HD 5.1 surround sound system here on Amazon., or an HD sound bar if you don't want all that hassle.In summary, this is a great TV and computer monitor.

It's more likely that it's due to placement, since this one is in my room and not in a living room.The one huge negative is the stand, it's made from cheap plastic and is wobbly and looks unstable.

Besides supporting 1080p, I also like that this comes with 3 HDMI ports, a VGA with audio, USB, composite (RCA), component (RGB), audio L+R (RCA) out, SPDIF, an old style RF cable hookup so you can use a set top box or even an over-the-air antenna because the internal tuner is both digital and analog, and finally a headphone jack for private listening, The TV is easy to set up and the remote is easy to use. There are enough adjustments so getting the color right is fairly easy. There is a simple equalizer and some settings for the audio, and the sound is pretty good, but it does sound a lot better hooked up to an external sound system. The plastic stand is sturdy enough, and it swivels quite far, but it doesn't tilt. Though there is the option to wall mount it, some of the connections are in the back, facing downwards, so it shouldn't be too difficult to hook stuff up, except maybe the USB port which is in the back too. The remaining connectors are on one side of the TV and there are some button controls on the other. All in all, I am very satisfied with this TV. It may not be internet ready but I have it hooked up to my laptop, so I have the internet on my TV, and as a monitor, it sure beats my laptop screen for watching Youtube and streaming movies, TV shows, or anything that the web offers, Good price, nice features, decent quality...

But now it works fine.We live in the country between 2 TV markets and we get many over-the-air channels, many in HD, and switching from external antenna to our DISH satellite is quite easy. Our previous set required an external tuner and we still have one set that requires a tuner. The Septre requires less of a signal than does the external tuner making reception of over-the-air channels quite reliable.The set does a good job of letting you know what resolution the channel is using and you can adjust the picture accordingly. I have read that the sound you get from most of these very thin sets is never as good as the sound you can get from the older sets which had larger speakers. This set has undistorted, reasonably good but not great sound. The 32\" size is just right for our viewing space. Most of our viewing is done 6-8 feet away from the set. The angle at which you can view the screen is good and viewing in room light is excellent as is the picture contrast. I was able to easily carry this set around using one arm and the set it replaced (same screen size) required 2 people to move it out of the room.

Yes it's a no name brand and yes it's quite possible I may need to replace this sooner rather than later and but of course if you read any other reviews you know the sound isn't top notch HOWEVER the sound isn't near as bad as I expected from reading other reviews.If you go into the sound menu there is even an EQ with presets of rock, pop, jazz and user (100, 250, 500, 1k, 2k, 4k and 10k) as well as your basic bass and treble and balance controls. This allows you to tweak the sound the way you like it. Not to mention the basic sound settings with presets they have already (Dynamic, Standard, Soft, and user) I simply plugged in my computer surround sound speakers into the headset jack and the sound is above average but I did mess around with the sound before I added the speakers and it was passable and not as bad as expected.The picture quality on this is A MAZE ING! I have a 48\" Sanyo in my living room and I bought this to be a TV, PC, and Xbox Monitor in my office/bedroom. Those that feel a 32\" monitor is too large for a PC monitor don't know how to adjust the settings on their PC. I actually have 2 PC's hook up to it. One is personal and the other is for my work at home job. If I ever have to go back to using a smaller screen for work I think I would.....well I'm sure it will never come to that since I'll just buy me another one. It is so nice to have multiple windows open and easily accessible of all different sizes on my screen. So nice to sit back and work without having to be right up on my monitor. On the personal side I love using my wireless keyboard (I bought a Logitech K400) with Multi Touch Touchpad to operate all my browsing/movie watching that I do from my PC. And for the Xbox 360 it's perfect for gaming at 1080p. Not to mention the picture quality while watching TV. Now I'll be honest most feed from cable companies are not at 1080p BUT if you are like me you can access your cable channels through your PC or gaming console and there you get full 1080p on every channel. I only use the TV tuner when I'm getting ready to fall asleep and set the sleep timer.Having 3 HDMI inputs was one of the main reasons I bought this model but everything else has been great as well. For instance the different settings that are available for the picture size is PERFECT! You have full 100%, normal, wide, cinema and zoom. Depending on the source I have used full, normal and cinema so far but I can imagine a need for all of them.This TV has so many different settings and tweaks I couldn't even imagine talking about all of them here but I will mention a few others that I haven't mentioned yet. Blue or black background when no source. Auto off when no source. Internal digital tuner. Parental settings. Date and time. Five picture modes (power saving, vivid, standard, mild and user. Color temperature. Noise reduction. Just to name a few.If you are even considering this for TV or PC or gaming console and haven't bought it yet you should add to your cart now and pick it up before they run out.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "tv for my son", "Author": "Anthony S.

It was of decent quality, with good picture and sound that is a bit tinny and cuts out during sudden increases in pitch. Overall, an average television, which is expected given the price. However, about three weeks ago it stopped working regularly. When I press the power button, the red light turns blue, which signifies power on. The problem is that the picture doesn't always show up, and the power button on the remote and the unit itself will not turn the television off. You have to unplug it, then hope it works. It's not uncommon for it to take at least five times to finally work. I would not purchase this product again. If you do, spend the $20 on a better warranty.Update - 10/25/13 - The manufacturer agreed to replace my unit. This sounded like great news, but I've now come to realize that their service is every bit as bad as their manufacturing standards. I requested a box and was told that I could expect delivery within 5-8 business days. Well, that was a lie, as they didn't even bother to ship the box until the seventh business day. I can now expect delivery on the 29th, which will make it a full eleven business days. I've asked customer service about this, but received only a very short message detailing the date the box was sent and a confirmation number. To make matters slightly worse, the email reads like it was typed by a child and the confirmation number was given without instruction. Luckily, I didn't have trouble figuring that out, but there might be a lot of people that lack the online familiarity to complete the task without some assistance.

To switch inputs you have to hit \"input\" then scroll up/down, then select. Not a big deal unless you are using it with a universal remote like a harmony. When it has to switch inputs it kicks off a macro that has to do each of those steps individually which takes a while, and one signal doesn't make it to the TV it throws off the remote.

It'd be nice if it had Picture in Picture but I guess that'd be a little too much to ask.  While I didn't need the screwdriver or the lens cloth, it was nice that they were included anyway.The reason I took a star off is because I have one stuck pixel (always at magenta, full brightness) on the left half of the screen.  I was seriously considering returning the TV but when you consider the price, the size of the screen, and the screen resolution, there's about a 2% chance of getting a single defective pixel so I figured I should just deal with it rather than take a chance on a new one.

Obviously HD is going to look the best but it does admirably with SD sources as well.  The tv came with 3 dead pixels.  1 i was able to get out.  1 is completely dead and the last one is stuck on red.  Also,  the horizontal row with the red pixel is dimmer than the rest.  so it you look closely there is a faint line running the entire width of the tv.  I felt none of this was worth returning over as i dont notice it from my viewing distance. The speakers are hit and miss.  While they arent great,  they are more than adequate depending on the source.  When the Tv was receiving digital audio,  the sound was more than adequate for my 12x13 room.  When it is analog audio,  its mediocre at best.  It really is liked night and day.The speakers are aim downwards.  had they been aimed at the wall, it would probably sounded better.  I ended up purchasing a samsung soundbar to compensate.  the stand is a joke as well.  It uses 4 screws(2xtype 1,2xtype2) to old the base to the tv.  The screw are either wrong or threaded improperly because the type 1 screws i couldnt get in for the life of me.  I wall mounted it anyway, but worth mentioning.  Its also fairly thick.  i bout a very low profile mount and from the wall to the front of the tv is 4.5 in.  It has a good number of hook ups that are all placed appropriately to make wall mounting easier.  it has a glossing black finish that scratches quite easily as well.

The tv worked for just under a year and then it decided not to work. There was a burning/melting smell and I couldn't figure out where it was coming from. One of the boards must have melted. So, I sent it back to Sceptre to get the tv fixed under warranty. Note: Don't throw your box away because they won't take it for repair without the original box. They will send you one by request if you don't have the original box. The warranty was just about ready to expire by approximately 4 weeks. We did receive the tv back from Sceptre and it was working. Then about 4 weeks later, my girlfriend noticed green lines and sound issues. Well, the tv is dead again. Total junk. I won't spend the $250 or more Sceptre charges to fix it. I can buy a better quality tv with that money. I purchased another brand tv from Dell a year before purchasing this one and I have had no problems at all with that one.

The 3 HDMI ports are a very definite plus - especially at this price.The picture is sharp and clear - I use over-the-air reception. 1080p HD is true 1080p HD. For OTA people, 480 and below will look like crap no matter the source, pc or OTA. OTA channels will vary by location (I get 80+ detected of which the big 4 + PBS are well represented.) The remote is very, very basic - again emphasis is on getting what you paid for.Sound is basic, although both a local jazz station and a classical world channel, both sound surprisingly good.

I connected it to my Fios box first with component cables and later HDMI cables and the picture quality is phenomenal with either option.  Some reviewers complained about the sound quality, and to them, I'd recommend an HDMI cable which seemed to broaden the audio spectrum, at least with mine.  Perfect for a bedroom television.

Thank you Amazon.Why we have come this far as humans and now someone decides to put speakers BEHIND the t.v.  I will never understand.  Engineering Devolution. The manufacturing of this t.v. is subpar.  The stand is loose so the t.v flops and sways if touched.  It leans to the right and slightly forward due the small cheap plastic base. There were also plastic shavings still dangling from the frame around the glass due to hasty assembly.  Considering the the rear facing speaker design, the tv sound is actually ok despite some of the other comments about the sound. (it is a tv after all, not a home stereo)  The picture and recovery are fine, although I don't know why the 'normal' screen setting makes the picture about 16\".  Why can't I watch a normal screen that fills the frame?  I need just one screen setting. (one that captures the entire display and fits the screen wholly.)  So the tv works.  yay.

I tried various on hand adapters, no dice.So I emailed Sceptre's tech support. I described the problem. They got back to me in about an hour, an exceptional response I thought. They asked about the HDMI cable, asked if i had tried one of the other HDMI ports, and asked if I had the right source selected.Source?Yes, dummy; source. The upper right button on the remote. I selected HDMI 1 in the source sub menu and it worked immediately.Picture quality was good, although some of the characters seemed to have a coloration to them (which could also be my eyes). I also noted that the dock at the bottom of my screen was running off the bottom of the viewable area. Using the remote (I can learn) I selected the button near the bottom labeled 'Aspect', and ran through the various options available; the dock ended up in its proper place, and red coloration of some characters went away.In summary:  good monitor for the new Mac mini, and excellent tech support / customer support.

The blue power light is still on but we are not getting a display or sound, We cut the power off and unplugged it for several minutes and tried it again,,,not good,,,SAD Valentine's Day! 20 days past Amazon return date so either way I am going to be out of more money trying to take it to get it fixed.
