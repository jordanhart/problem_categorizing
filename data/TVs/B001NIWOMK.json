{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My backyard barbecue enclosure is complete!", "Author": "Dustin Perry", "ReviewID": "R211CORLJWSRIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I frequently entertain friends, family and guests from the neighborhood with weekend barbecues, and the cookout space in my backyard is the toast of the town. We've got tables set up, a marble pool and a trampoline for the kids, but until now everyone had to relocate inside once the traditional \"Movie Night\" portion of the evening kicked off. Now, don't get me wrong: the entertainment setup in my living room is a thing of beauty, but with mountain view we have from our back yard, it's a crime not to be able to sit under the stars, relax with a drink, and enjoy a movie with company.That changed when I purchased this 46-inch all-weather LCD TV (which, oddly enough, is mounted on a brick-wall backdrop similar to the one pictured here). Now I can screen my favorite films in my back yard without having to worry about the elements putting a damper on the evening or wreaking havoc on my TV.The aluminum casing is excellent and protects against all types of adverse weather -- rain, snow, fog, wind. I of course don't recommend leaving this thing outside in a storm or hurricane, but there is no need to pack things up and bring the party inside just because it starts sprinkling (my enclosure is covered, too, which certainly helps protect the TV.)Looking on Amazon's site, it appears this is the only all-weather HDTV of its kind, so it goes without saying that if you're looking to extend your home entertainment center to the outdoors, you cannot go wrong with this set.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$4,779.99", "Features": "Bright 46-in 1,920 x 1080 Full-HD LCD display for improved outdoor viewing\nAnti-reflective protective glass reduces glare, increases contrasts and protects LCD screen from damage\nPowder-coated aluminum housing protects internal components from weathering effects such as rain, humidity and dust\nMulti-fan airflow system keeps unit cool and dry in temperatures up to 122 Degrees F\nInternal thermostatically controlled heater protects TV from freezing in temperatures as low as -40 Degrees F", "Name": "SunBriteTV SB-4610HD-SL-R Pro Series 46 in. 1080p 60 Hz LCD Full-HD True Outdoor All-Weather TV (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61aGRZ8bI%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001NIWOMK"}}
