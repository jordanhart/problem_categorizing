I put the wireless media box which came with the set about 10 feet away with no direct line of sight and was able to show HD tv with great clarity WIRELESSly... this is a great feature.I have wireless phone, internet and head sets which did not cause any interference with this TV.The 55LHX's lg logo on the TV is where the TV's receiver is, so if you stand right in front, you will see some static or no picture as you are no blocking the signal. But, I will know to avoid to stand right in front of the TV :)The viewing angle is good, I tilt it downwards about 12 degrees for less glare. The TV screen do not reflect much, but the black frame does.Just a note, with the 240HZ True motion on, sports looks very life like; but on movies it looks 3D ish, so shut I had to shut it off. Now I know why a 240Hz tv can possibly view 3d movies.I have a Pioneer plasma which still looks way better than this TV, but this TV is as good if not better than my sharp Aquos. So, maybe its a settings thing.There are lots of settings, but I have yet to find the best one, so please leave me a comment if you know what the best settings are....GL.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV but too expensive at Amazon", "Author": "jrsposter", "ReviewID": "R1IQVYW4E1229J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a perfect HDTV set with a great wireless media console which avoids the necessity of having a million wires going up to the screen unit.  The wireless connection to the screen works flawlessly with absolutely no interference-induced flickering, but I have my console right in front of the set.  Come to think of it, where else would I put it when I want to control the television set while I am watching it?The picture is sharp and bright, and it has loads of wonderful features.  It is backlit with local dimming, and this set really does have \"blacker blacks.\"  The contrast ratio is 5 million to one.  Setup was a breeze.The only thing I want to mention is that Best Buy is selling this same HDTV for $2999.98 including delivery and setup, five hundred dollars cheaper than Amazon is offering it.  That is a surprise to me, because Amazon normally has the lowest prices.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Finally! The Ultimate TV", "Author": "Peter Browne", "ReviewID": "R1NDSANO5FJOGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall Rating 5 out of 5 \"Have gone through about 10 TVs since 2006. Samsungs, Sharpes, Sonys and even other LGs. Always finding something either lacking or a problem that got to be annoying enough for me to start looking for another set. When I heard about the Matte Screen disappearing, to be replaced with these new super thin reflective models with their own problems caused by compromises to the LED system, decided to jump on the super deal LG had in it's 55LHX model. This use to be their top of the line with the top of the line pricing to go with it: now affordable, Matte screen, Wireless (I don't use it), and incredible Blacks and Colour. Some minor Picture Wizard tweaking, THX Values put in Expert 1 and 2, transfer the Picture Wizard settings to Expert 2 and THX. Drop the Backlight down on Expert 1 and THX to 10 for evening viewing. Expert 2 for Day. The result, the Ultimate TV I've been looking for! No desire to buy any more TVs!LED count 3360 - the new Models 920 - so figure it out more, means Better! The Panel itself Black! Not Greyish. Can't go wrong with this purchase!\"Would you recommend this product as a gift?YesWho would this be a perfect gift for?Me!", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Only gets better as it ages.", "Author": "P.

It has a Matte Screen Finish, Wireless(*) and is just the Best of the Best! (*) - the downer is the Wireless Media Box - so unless you want to go Wireless, plan on Not using it. Go directly to the 55LHX Panel from your AVR or VE system. The Wireless Media Box does downgrade the 55LHX PQ. The Panel itself, is just about as Black as the Bezel! So for those Not liking these new Highly Reflective Panels now being offered on the Newer Models, grab one of these quick before they're all gone! After 4 weeks of use, the PQ is Stunning! (Out of the Box, it's already Great!)One of America's best known calibrators has now rated this particular Model with a 50. Next was the Pioneer (Reference)Kuro Plasma at 48. So this IDE/LCD is being rated higher than the Standard Reference Pioneer Plasma! No other set he's rated has this high a rating!April 10, 2013 Update: The New Calman 5.1.1, plus an iScan Duo on my wife's 55LHX, plus a Lumagen Radiance XE-3D on mine, recent calibrations are making this TV one Spectacular TV! The PQ was there, it took continuous calibrating experimenting, new Calibration Software, and our sets only continue to get Better! And I'm still working on making it even Better still!

If you know how to read and write and as well follow instruction you have nothing to worry about. This TV has a very funny setting. Don't try to block the signal or get blue-tooth derives closer because some interfere with it. Sometime they will even transmit line like lighting in the sky. when you watch movie or play game with this TV it feels like you are inside it. I bough this TV couple of months after the release date, still till-date I am still enjoying it. I bought mine from qvc.com because no other store has it. Don't hesitate just pull that check and check it out.

I wanted to place a new TV on a certain wall in my house but in doing that it would cause me to have some seriously long HDMI cables! It's hard to explain here why but I began by checking prices for 30ft plus long cables and found the term wireless HD TV on a website. That peeked my interest obviously and I began researching. I figured it was too good to be true and didn't work as good as advertised. I read several positive reviews and decided to give it a shot. Glad I did! The ease of hooking up the cables to the media box along with the TV's feature of instantly searching for the wireless feed every time it's turned on makes it so easy you forget its wireless. (Except when you look at the TV on the wall and you don't see a bunch of wires hanging below it.You do have to have a power cable obviously but if you place the outlet behind the TV you don't even see that cable! It's just looks like a big picture hanging on the wall!My media box is only a few feet from the TV (I know I mentioned needing a 30 plus ft cable and I would have its just hard to explain the layout of the room/wall I'm talking about) and I normally have 3 bars on the wireless meter. I have it in a small cabinet with it facing away from the TV. If you were able to project the signal directly to the TV (line of site) I can get full strength (5 bars). That would require me to turn the media box around thus displaying the back of the unit and I didn't want that to be visible. Nevertheless I've never lost signal but I have noticed a few lines that will occasionally appear on the TV when my kids are jumping around in front of the cabinet in our living room. Nothing that drastic and since it's only happens occasionally I don't mind it.Overall a great find and I couldn't be happier.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002N95XZ8"}}
