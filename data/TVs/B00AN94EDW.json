{"Reviews": [{"Title": "4th HDTV, and its not great, but not bad", "Author": "Kat \"Reviewer @ Shivers Of Horror\"", "ReviewID": "RBO8HVGCLHJUR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I originally had the Sony BRAVIA S-Series KDL-46S5100 46-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV, Black for 4 or so years. Great picture, except for some ghosting and sound cutting in and out. It was under an extended warranty (highly recommend that for these HDTVs, they don't last long!) and I was able to get my money back and purchase a new TV.We got the VIZIO E470i-A0 47-inch 1080p 120Hz LED Smart HDTV because we HAD to have streaming. We were sick of paying $60 for xbox gold and the streaming ability on our Sony BluRay player was busted for some reason. So our choices of TVs with streaming in our budget with extended warranty was limited. Unfortunately the E470i had some serious issues. It was very pixely, and the color presets were all a mess. I messed with that thing for about 3 days and we had to return it.The only one left within our budget was this M470VSE. As soon as I turned it on I knew it was a keeper compared to the last Vizio. Its MUCH clearer. The color presets weren't that far off what they should have been, and everything worked great...However, I still do not think it is as clear as the Sony. The colors don't quite POP like it did. Even with a ton of tweaking. And it seems to have audio sync issues. Sometimes it constantly happens, and then other times it doesn't happen for days. I'm really hoping it won't be a problem. But considering there is an audio sync option build in, I'm thinking Vizio knew about the problem and just didn't know or care about fixing it, so added that. Who knows.As far as the \"Soap Opera\" effect as the other reviewer mentioned. This is because of the 120hz. I've done a ton of research on this. As far as I like, I like the 60hz better because I hate that effect. What is the point of paying extra for a feature you dislike? But my husband (who hates that too) wouldn't take anything less then a 120hz LED.Anyhow, you can turn off the effect by going to:Menu > Settings > Game Mode and turn it ON. This will stop that effect. HOWEVER, I've recently learned that if you do play video games, this effect will go OFF, and you have to go back in and turn it ON again. A little annoying.As for my personal color settings (for most shows and movies its decent, some look a little orange, I have the following:Menu > PicturePicture Mode: CustomBacklight 100Brightness 52Contrast 63Color 70 (change this if the color is too bright)Tint 0Sharpness 6Menu > Picture > MoreColor Temperature: NormalRed 58Green 50Blue 35Red 49Green 50Blue 49Menu > Picture > MoreAdvanced Picture:Noise Reduction LOWMPEG NR LOWColor Enhancement Grn/FleshAdaptive Luma STRONGFilm Mode OFFBacklight Control OFFAmbient Light Sensor OFFHope this helps someone! Any questions please feel free to ask and I will do my best to answerUPDATE 4/19/13: I was recently house sitting, and couldn't find the remote for the SONY Bravia 3D TV I was watching (sorry no more info then that at the moment), and it was stuck in the \"soap opera\" mode. But I realized it was much much much more of a subtle effect then the Vizio TV and there was no pizelization. So, I think I'm coming to the conclusion that Vizio really is not very good.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value for a 120hz smart 47\" TV.", "Author": "Pug Ster \"pugster\"", "ReviewID": "RRDIYM76X4PQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Vizio does it again, pushing the prices of smart tv's while other manufacturers are catching up.  The price of the Vizio 47\" smart 120hz led tv simply can't be beat compared to Samsung, LG, or Sony.  The quality of the TV at the entry level seems to be the same or better.  I like the feature where you can connect a usb drive to the TV and you can actually play 1080p videos in it, although it does not support some codecs.  Many other apps are nicely made like the youtube and maps app.  Though I wish they had some other apps like accessing gmail or hotmail and a web browser app.  Hopefully they will have an update in the future that gives you these apps.  Considering that smart tv's are relatively new, it might take a while before the software catches up to the hardware.  This TV also have a skype app, though if you want to do video chat in your TV, you have to buy 1 $150 proprietary Video camera for it.Besides what I mentioned above, my other big peeve about this TV is that it takes literally 10 seconds from the time you turn on the TV till you see a picture.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for T.V. VERY BAD for gaming.", "Author": "JasonUSMC", "ReviewID": "R1SPCJ3SDOFM88", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Have had this TV probably a little over 8 months now and while I'm basically happy with it, I do have a few gripes.The GOOD: Great price, good picture quality for its range, built in wi-fi is great and the super thin design is sexy as hell.The BAD: Terrible TV gaming lag!! It takes a little longer than I think it should to turn on, but that I can deal with.  What I can't deal with, however, is its rather Terrible TV-Gaming-Lag. it wasn't even until I had to temporarily use an older 32 inch LCD sharp tv that I realized how bad it was.  any first person shooter gamer out there knows that TV lag can be the difference of virtual life and death. for instance, on my vizio I have been struggling for months to obtain a kill to death ratio on most first person shooter games above 1 kill to 1 death.  been hovering around .6-.7.  when I switched to my Sharp tv, making no other changes I instantly saw it go up to 1.3 and a visually noticeable difference in speed.  it was literally like playing a different game.  and sharp doesn't even make good TVs. I can only imagine a good quality TV with a sub 20 mil second response time.  I would venture this one is above 100 milliseconds.  Due to its terrible lag, you can forget about 1080p for gaming! Out of the question! 720p in gaming mode (which puts it to 60 Hertz refresh rate) is what you're stuck with.OVERALL: unless you're a serious FPS gamer, this is a great TV for the price but if you're a gamer steer clear.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV, picture and features...as long as it doesn't freeze", "Author": "carey", "ReviewID": "R1R1JPMS6FR064", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I spent extra money for the extra features, such as apps, streaming and the cool remote. What I really should have done was purchased less features and used my savings to order a Roku box from Amazon.I haven't even noticed the \"soap opera effect.\" I guess I'm not smarter than my TV. No, my complaint is that it freezes too often, and by \"freeze,' I mean you have to unplug the TV from the wall to reset it.In reading through similar complaints, some people say it never freezes when watching a DVD on it. That's good, because I figure if I add a Roku box to it, my problem will be solved. While not certain of this, it seems to freeze most often while streaming Amazon Prime movies to it. Buggy app is understandable, somewhat, but a buggy app should not crash your TV and make you have to unplug it and plug it back in to make it work again...ever.Also, if you compare the Roku box to the apps on this TV, the apps would be two star and the Roku box would be five full stars. Here is why. The apps do not take into account the full screen of the TV. It's ten times easier to navigate Amazon Prime on the Roku box as it is this TV.Bottom line: GET A DUMB TV and add a Roku box to the mix to increase its intelligence! Forget about the Roku Jr. here, that crashes and burns. Shame on Vizio for not coming up with a fix for all the people online complaining about the TV freezing.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad tv", "Author": "321", "ReviewID": "R3TIOJBHAJJCTF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i have had this tv for 2 days and it is awful there is no setting for smooth motion everthing looks like a soap opera tech suport is no help i will be returning for a different brand and never buy any vizio product again", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Vizio 47' LED 1080p 120Hz HDTV | M470VSE", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HtHfk9KGL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AN94EDW"}}
