{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent choice, great delivery service", "Author": "JCM", "ReviewID": "R1IB9FA3UZXRYV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided on the new Toshiba XV545U after extensive research, mainly for the overall design, combination of features and SRT technology.Delivery Service: I ordered direct from Amazon.com and the TV arrived the day after I placed the order (amazing); the \"white glove\" service was great - the guys handled it with care and brought it straight into the room where I set it up. Came in perfect condition.Ease of Set-up: I turned it on right out of the box with the default settings (most settings default to \"auto\") and the picture is great - the new AutoView feature takes care of most adjustments for you, so it is very simple to get up and going.Picture Quality: I have the TV hooked to a FiOS HD DVR box and Sony 350 BlueRay player via HDMI, and a Wii via Component Cable. So far, the picture looks fantastic overall. HDTV quality is excellent and BlueRay is awesome as expected. However, SRT is the real differentiator, as standard DTV signals look very good; have not tried a standard DVD yet. SRT does not seem to improve the quality of the Wii picture that much, but it is still good. The 120Hz implementation is also well done, as I do not see any motion blur.Matte Screen: the screen is a matte surface and does a great job of minimizing glare.Sound Quality: the sound is better than I expected from the SoundStrip technology - you do not even see the speakers, but the sound is decent (for built-in speakers).Design: the TV has a nice, rich look - very clean lines with the new double skin thin-line bezel and high-gloss black cabinet.Overall -- highly recommend this TV!", "Date": "October 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great s far!", "Author": "Don J. Desmarteau \"Audio Video Buff\"", "ReviewID": "R24ZUBQMHEV0BV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for a month now, so I can not speak for it's reliability yet, but I can say that I am totally pleased with this TV so far.  I comparison shopped for a couple of weeks before deciding on the 46XV545U.  This TV was the best value and had the most bells and whistles for the money hands down.  The picture is stunning in HD, BluRay and DVD's and I can even say standard def TV is not too bad either, although once you watch HD it is hard too settle for standard def.  It's multi unit remote is well laid out and is now the only remote I use for my whole system, it runs the TV plus 3 other devices.  It takes about 4 seconds for the TV to turn on and from what I've been reading that's in a pretty good range.  The TV's menus are easy too navigate and well laid out.  There are 6 picture mode settings - Auto View, Sports, Standard, Movie, PC, and user preference, the TV will remember which setting you have for each device which brings me to my only complaint so far, there is only one user preference setting so if you want to tweak the sports mode a little bit then that will be your user setting, then if you tweak the movie setting then that becomes the user setting and you lose the tweaked sports setting, although I liked the factory settings I would like to tweak each setting a little so 5 user preference spots would have been ideal, all in all not a big deal but it is something worth knowing about.  This TV has plenty of inputs and I have tried them all, one thing worth metioning is the VGA D-Sub PC input can only handle the following settings: 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x768, 1360x768 and 1280x1024.  I hooked up my PC through the HDMI input and it was stellar at full 1080p resolution.  The sound from this TV was more than exceptable but I have surround sound so I do not use the TV speakers.I choose not to buy the extended warrenty after reading reviews on them. you get 1 year manufacter warrenty and my credit card covers the second year for free so it was not worth the extra money to get a third or fourth year of coverage, so I hope this TV will last!Delivery took one week, and I bought direct from Amazon with the \"white glove\" delivery.  They can unpack the TV and take away the box, but I reccomend keeping the box in case any returns are needed.  I had this TV unpacked and setup in less than 15 minutes.In summation, I think you will not find a better TV for a little over $1600 bucks that has all the features of this one.  As long as this TV does not break down I will be very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good HD TV, great price but SRT not really work", "Author": "K. Su", "ReviewID": "RVXUFRMBE827Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[...]Anyway, I agreed all the review above. The pictures quality is great and sound is good enough. What really disappoints me is the SRT feature that supposes to upconvert everything, but I found this feature is not really work like the way it should be.I have another 1 year old Philips 47\" LCD TV. Both Philips and Toshiba have great pictures in HD.  I compare the std Channel between my Phillips and Toshiba with SRT. The Toshiba SRT not really improves the pictures quality at all. I also have two Sony DVD players (same model) one for the Philips and one for the Toshiba. I did see the Toshiba SRT improve my DVD pictures quality a little, but if I compared the pictures quality with my Pioneer DV-400V-K upconvert DVD. My Pioneer DV-400V-K upconvert the pictures much better than the Toshiba SRT.Another complains about this Toshiba is the pictures size setting. When you switch between TV inputs from TV to DVD, this TV won't remember your last pictures size setting. Every time I turn on my Sony DVD, this Toshiba always default to 4:3 screen size. My last setting was widescreen 16:9. I don't have this problem when I watch my Philips.But overall, I am happy with what I get.

I price check everything. I ended up buying this set from a local Conn's who had a sale I could not beat online (which I found astonishing).There are some who complain about the green being off on this set. Honestly, I was barely able to see a difference when it was sitting next to one of the $2,600 new Sony models. And since most of us will not be watching the two sets side-by-side, there is no problem. The blacks are deep, the color is rich, there are no artifacts at all, and the uniformity is good.That said, this TV is not the best on the market. I would not pay more than $1,300 for it. The Samsung ToC's and Sony XBR Bravia models are nicer. If you are not concerned about money, go for those. I would have.

One small drawback: when switching channels using the numbers on the remote there is a slight delay.  That doesn't happen when you switch from guide to the channel or back to a previous channel.The delivery from Amazon was less than perfect.  The TV set was sent from a location in Pennsylvania to Texas via a company called Pilot.  It turned out that the delivery could not be traced at all.  Final delivery to our home was made by another delivery company (local) that we had never heard of.  However, the TV was brought in the house and set up by the delivery personnel as expected.

Color is off out of the box. Factory settings for green are oversaturated, skintones have a green shade to them. You have to adjust the green in (-13,-11,+7)COLOR MASTER, Color Temp (Medium),(-10)G DRIVE to get it under control, took me some effort but I got them just right without paying for professional calibration.(Don't get Best Buy to do it, they have no clue what they are doing). SRT works pretty good, it won't turn SD into HD but it improves the picture. I left my SRT on Mode 3 Level 1(it has 5 levels of SRT processing in 3 modes-15 deifferent settings), most of the people complaining probably have no clue. Too much SRT will make the picture terrible. SRT will be disabled if you have a 1080p/1080i video source. If you have an upconverting DVD player you need to disable it to get SRT to work. Have not observed artifacts in the 120Hz smooth mode like can be seen on the Samsungs.Cons -Don't like the menus on the screen. Don't like the remote. A power outage caused my HDMI settings to be messed up(orange screen - really weird). Sent an e-mail to Tech Support and got the problem resolved, unplug TV and video source from the wall for 5-10 min to reset it. Color controls in Color Master allow for +/- 30, but using anything more +/- 15 will introduce artifacts into the picture, at 30 the picture will be unwatchable.

Tack on that it cost $300-400 less than the comparable Samsung or Sony and this LCD TV has to be considered a \"Best Buy\".If you are worried about glare from lighting or a sunny room, this and the Sony are the way to go.  The picture quality for non-HD broadcasts is very good, but in HD the picture is superb.This is my 3rd Toshiba television.  My first is a 26 inch that I bought in 1990 that is still going strong.  My second (which is being replaced by this) is a Toshiba 50\" projection TV that I purchased in 1995 and has just started to require some adjustments to the CRTs.  I fully expect that this Toshiba will give me the same type of quality performance for many years to come.I guess if I was a hardcore \"Techie\", I could find some things to whine about regarding this TV.

Perfect size for our Living Room, fantastic picture, plenty of input options and I love what the 120hz does to HD images.  I find that it is very evident with shows and commercials that are filmed with HD cameras.  With out the 120hz on they are \"fake\" looking, too sharp.  With 120hz on they are more natural looking, like film.Again, we are new with this TV so only time will tell but for $1200 we are thrilled.ps - Call of Duty 4 rocks on this system!", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV", "Author": "A.

I use this TV with my PC (DVI to HDMI) you can go as far as 1080p (1920x1080) 60Hz although it depends how far you sit from the TV, you might not be able to read normal windows font @ 1080p (thus I have reduced resolution for optimal viewing pleasure, since I sit 8-9 feet away from this TV).As far as SRT feature is concerned it actually makes a heck of a difference with your good old DVD player (@ 480p resolution). I'm not sure why some reviewers were negative about it, I think CNET gave it a bad rap, difference is also visible on 720p resolution with my HD Terk antenna.I have not seen any \"ghosting\", nor have any dead pixels on my TV.

This Toshiba looked as good or better than these higher priced brands. I've only used the set for HD TV via $15.00 RCA antenna, (which has worked fine) and the picture is superb. Also, this Cinema is Toshiba's flagship line so it's probably been qc'ed quite a bit. This one is replacing my CR Toshiba which I had for 10 years with no problems, except the remote giving out.

Adam", "ReviewID": "R6IX7S4C9Z43V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will list the improvements I noted from a 47\" Toshiba LCD TV I purchased a little over 2 years ago.  My existing components (Sony DVD/VHS Recorder, an analog VHS/DVD player & a Blu Ray DVD player (brand new) were moved over to the new TV.1.  Sound levels are now the same when I move from different input sources, including outside anteena.  Previously, it was a mess (all different) and for the standard DVD player I had to increase the volume by 50-70% to nearly the maximum sound level.  Previously, I blamed the components.  Nothing worst than watching a DVD and switching to check sports scores and being blasted away by sound.2.  Location of the HDMI connections on the back are much improved.  The older TV had the inputs in the hardest to reach, worst possible location.3.  In the older TV, picture quality from an extreme side angle was blurry and unwatchable, now the picture quality is great from any angle.4.  The oversized remote control is a tad smaller by doing away the mode select buttons.  I used them, but won't miss them.  It's thinner, weighs less, but the buttons are the same size and same number.  It is just better designed.5.  Trust me that the stand is better.6.  Picture quality is better and fast action scenes are flawless.It seems like Toshiba did a really good job with these major improvements as well as some minor improvements I didn't mention.My only complaint is that I wished there was a \"CC\" closed caption button on the remote like there was on my really old analog TV set. Instead, you have to pull out the manual to figure it out.  Usually, I say the heck with it and hence I never learn.If you are a first time buyer, be happy that you waited until now to buy.

We were looking at plasmas, but the reflection problem was a show-stopper for our family room.  The Toshiba has no reflection problem day or night.  The picture is beautiful.  You'll wonder how you lived with your CRT.  No jaggies from the usual sources, though some from some 24p movies.  Color balance was perfect on delivery; we haven't played with it.  We watch from 10-15 feet away, but the picture is clear and bright from 20 feet.  Watching from the side.. 45 degrees, there is no distortion.  The images are very good in the daytime and awesome at night with the lights turned down.  We ultimately bought the 46\" size, but in hindsight, I think the larger version (52\"?) would have been better, tho more expensive.The Toshiba has half a dozen aspect ratio options, all available on the remote.  We found to our dismay, that a lot of cable/broadcast TV, while digital, is still in the conventional 4:3 format; essentially a square picture with black bars on the side.  Forcing it into a wide screen display distorted the images, so we mostly watch channels that broadcast in HD widescreen.The multi-function remote is complex, but once you get used to it, the necessary controls are easy to manipulate via an on-screen display.  It's also lit, which is very helpful at night, when the lights are off.  There is also a limited set of controls on the TV itself in case the remote conks out.  We weren't looking for that, but it was nice to find.It has more connections than you'll likely need including multiple HDMI, component, composite, PC, even a USB slot.  We have cable coming into the component (Y, Pb, Pr) connection, DVD/Blu-ray through S-video, and PS3 through conventional composite connections.  The Toshiba has its own digital audio out connection (Dolby), but there are lots of ways to hook up an external audio source.  It sits pretty low on its own stand, so you don't see the cables coming out of the back.The Toshiba has its own sort of 3d/stero sound system, so audio sounds like it's coming from the side, even though the speakers are just on the bottom.  A nice touch -- hard to appreciate looking at the specs.Some of the reviews mentioned that the shiny frame was a drawback.  We found no problem from the frame.  It's pretty narrow, anyway.  Reviews also warned that store displays would have the brightness turned up, but we didn't find the image much different when we got it home.  The Toshiba name on the bottom is lit, but it dims depending on the light in the room.It's an excellent unit.  It seemed when we were looking, that each brand/model TV had some sort of limitation in one of the specs, usually in the number or type of connections; or it was too expensive.  There are no limitations on the Toshiba and it's a great price.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 46\" TV Regza", "Author": "John J.
