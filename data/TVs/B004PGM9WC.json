We hung it on the wall with a swivel and have been completely satisfied with everything about this product. The picture is great, and having the combination unit with the DVD player right inside the television is really convenient so that we don't have to find a place to store another piece of equipment.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture and decent sound for 26-Inch TV", "Author": "R. Diamond \"Diamondback662\"", "ReviewID": "R2VI1EOOIASLDC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Picked one of these up for use in a bedroom after looking one over in the store.For an LCD that is not LED, it has a very good picture with a pretty good viewing angle.Sound is surprisingly good for 8w speakers. I like that there are various connections for different external speaker add-ons. A built in equalizer with slider bars is nice with several presets plus a customizable user selection. Not a lot of bass but what do you expect from a TV this size. (After just a little adjusting, I am satisfied with the sound and won't be adding any external speakers.)5ms response should make this a good Display for video games and action movies. (sports fans should be happy as well)Folks that are finicky about their CC should be very happy as there are all kinds of CC text settings: Font, size, color, opacity, and background color.4 x HDMI Ports! Wow! Don't see that very often on smaller TVs!VGA port for a PC plus an audio input so it can double as a very large monitor.There are also two component (YPbPr or YCbCr) and one composite (RCA)if you have some A/V stuff with these old connections.Built in Tray-less DVD player is a great bonus.Comes with nice solid feeling RCA remote with smart layout.Input button on remote is easy to find and isn't hidden in menu as on some remotes.DVD controls are all there as well.200x100mm VESA Mounts.800:1 dynamic contrast ratio could be a little better. Picture will require a little tweaking out of the box as will the sound.Stand assembly was probably the easiest I've seen and all the holes lined up great!Roku users will be glad to know it works great via the HDMI connection and this is how the TV will primarily be used in our home.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Glad I bought this product.", "Author": "wonderwoman", "ReviewID": "R228Y81YPBHU5T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the RCA 26\" TV w/DVD player for a great price. Actually I hadn't realized I'd ordered a 26\" and also was not sure if RCA was still a good product, it is. The TV came very well packaged, nothing broken, all parts there and so easy to put together. I kept the box til yesterday in case I needed to do a return, I don't. TV has great picture, sound. I really like buying from Amazon.com. I like getting purchases delivered to my door. I prefer to buy sold and delivered by Amazon and so far have not been disappointed.I've purchased and had delivered, yesterday, another item from Amazon.

I had the old tube-type and as HDTV became the standard, I felt out of date and also frustrated by the current TV picture screen. With the new television season approaching, I realized that if I wanted to buy a new one, I better seriously start looking. Did some searching as to what features I wanted and narrowed it down to what size, because I have an entertainment center that limits my options.  So, I checked Amazon and another store online, as well as a couple of stores here locally. Then I saw this television and it just seemed right. Did some specific research and decided I liked the combo TV/DVD aspects. At the time the other online store was selling it for the same price online and what sold me on Amazon was the fact that I could get free ship to home in two days (I belong to Prime). I made the plunge and purchased it. And am not sorry I did.It was easy to put together. Sits perfectly in my entertainment center and the remote was easy to understand. I decided to upgrade my cable (gotta do that when you get a new shiny TV!):) and while I had a few problems with hooking up (but not the television's fault), it's now running perfectly. The sound is good, but not outstanding, but to be expected since I don't have a surround sound system. Heck, I don't have a sound system at all. But not to fear, the sound is good. The picture is awesome. Beautiful colors and clear.All in all, I am well satisfied with my purchase and am enjoying watching TV again after years of distorted pictures.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "baso56", "ReviewID": "R1C7TBZAMNFVU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An excellent TV, especially the picture. Dvd works great and plenty of device inputs and connections. Easy set up including connection to an older AV receiver and speaker system that I have and now sounds very nice. Also fits into an older entertainment cabinet that housed a 27\" tube TV and looks great. Swivel base is also a plus. Would recommend this for any smaller room. All in all, a great little TV, especially for the price (I paid $269 w/ no sales tax and free shipping that took about a week). I've always had a good experience with Amazon.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incompatible Parts", "Author": "L. D. Rafey \"math'nmore\"", "ReviewID": "R1YGRPXA5QGFEN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "TV arrived well packaged and unbroken and in a timely fashion, however there were two necks supplied, both identical, neither of which were compatible with the supplied stand. They were apparently meant for a stand with widely separated screw holes. I ended up using my old stand, which isn't as stable but it will have to do for now. The TV set up was a bit more difficult than I anticipated as there is no user's guide and the menu was a bit more complicated than usual but once you can locate the autosetup (not so easy to find), it gets-er-done without much fuss. Channel location took a good deal of time so be prepared to wait ... and wait ... and wait. Great picture and sound and you can, of course, alter the screen for wide vs. cinema, etc and get surround sound, etc. I like the DVD Combo but have not tried it as yet. There are a variety of additional options as well, which I have not had a chance to use so far. Although this has turned out to be a great purchase in terms of cost and quality, I only hope this TV lasts longer than what was noted by several of the reviewers.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I got a  lemon too", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "R8JCMGDJQUOY5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's fine for watching DVDs but when I try to use it to watch TV, the DVD player keeps going on by itself even if there is no DVD in it.
