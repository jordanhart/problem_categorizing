{"Reviews": [{"Title": "BIG TV, has all the current features, user friendly", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R24YCNQPVYMDJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is a strong solid performer.  It's Consumer Report Magazine's #1 ranked projection TV.  It has all the up to date features a HDTV needs ... it has the DVI option for HDTV, has Component Inputs for your DVD player, has S-Video for your satellite or similar, has several standard A/V inputs for your VCR or game system, etc.,.  It has everything you need for your basic entertainment system.  Additionally the picture quality is one of the best for a projection system.  But be weary of that concept, this TV is huge...57\", and with this amount of size, the picture quality on \"smaller\" objects is not going to be super crisp or sharp using even a satellite digital feed.  But that holds true on all TVs this big...I think.  So for example when watching basketball and you get the half court view the players are not real super sharp ... you can't really see those little details like face features, etc.,.  You know it's KOBE but you can't pick up the eyes, etc.,.  But for \"regular\" shows that usually don't have such small images, it's wonderful.  Toshiba has made the remote and TV use very easy and user friendly.  You can easily access video 1,2,3,4 etc.,. for the various electronic components you have.  So all good.  BUT ... one drawback was the amount of time it took for delivery from Amazon.  It took a month although the initial advertised estimate was 1 to 2 weeks.  I notice now, though, it says 1 to 2 days, but I notice it's coming from J&R not Amazon and the shipping jumped like $200 so maybe that isn't an issue now.  Bottom Line: An overall high quality, full featured, 57\" HDTV.", "Date": "April 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV, Excellent Price, Excellent Shipping", "Author": "Daniel C. Staples", "ReviewID": "R4WOE16QWR1ZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had the TV a few days, but I have to say its spectacular. It worked great right out of the box and has an awesome picture. I was particularly impressed with Amazon and the shipping company. The Amazon price including shipping was over $300 less than Best Buy's best sales price (with tax). I was a little worried about shipping such a beast, but it came on a pallet, they wheeled it right in and it was set up in about 15 minutes flat. FABULOUS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. 5 STARS.", "Date": "February 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Broke after the first week-2 months gone by and still broke", "Author": "\"mholleran2\"", "ReviewID": "R26RLX1RUT6O83", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Toshiba TV was rated the #1 buy by Consumer Reports.  This is what motivated us to purchase this TV even though we had read alot of negative feedback from buyers who experienced breakdowns soon after purchase and long waits for part replacement.  We shrugged off those reviews by rationalizing that out of the thousands of people who buy this TV, probably only the ones with a bad Toshiba experience take the time to write one.  One week after buying the Toshiba however I turned on the TV and when the screen just showed solid green I had the sinking feeling I should have listened to the nay sayers a little more closely.  It is two months later and all I get is \"the part should be shipping Monday and then it will be 3-5 business days after that\" followed by \"I'm sorry sir, the part should be shipping Wednesday\", and finally, \"It's not going out this week but we show it should be shipping on Monday\".Toshiba customer service was unable to provide any help at all and they generally don't see a problem with someone spending $2000 for a T.V., using it a week, and then having them wait weeks and weeks to get it fixed.  Again, it is a great T.V. if your are willing to risk having it break and waiting months for a replacement part.  I would strongly advise anyone thinking of buying a Toshiba projection TV to think twice and read some of the things other people have written.  It just isn't worth the frustration", "Date": "March 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price!", "Author": "I. Littman \"Cordless phone expert\"", "ReviewID": "R1WHNSJ56SE5QZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading many reviews and having past experience with Toshiba (good ones), my wife and I took the plunge and bought this projection tv (Toshiba 57H83 57\" HDTV-Ready TheaterWide Projection TV).  Other than the slow shipping, when arrived, it was amazingly easy to set up, with automated focusing to line up the 3 cathode rays.  The picture is incredible.  We don't even have cable or satellite, using just an aerial antennae, and still, just an incredible picture.  The image is even viewable from side angles without much degradation of the picture.The one gripe I have is that for some unknown reason if a wrong button is hit on the remote by accident, it has changed the default input setting from antenna to cable.  Mostly a minor annoyance.  Other than that, the menus are easy to navigate and the front panel with the video 3 inputs are nice.  Component video on the back is really nice with a progressive scan DVD.  Makes a big difference!  I'd recommend it to anyone and am pleased so far with the quality from Toshiba.  Other information, we've had the tv about 3 months now with no issues, paid 1799 through Amazon directly, shipping was very slow though, took about a month and a half total.", "Date": "December 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good picture when not broken...", "Author": "\"mtzullo\"", "ReviewID": "R2PL61DVEAD5F0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had this TV for less than a month and the picture was great.

Gelb", "ReviewID": "R3I8JGOEPV744O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My wife and I were excited at finding such a good TV at a semi-reasonable price ($1900); we had owned a Toshiba 26 inch for 11 years without a hitch. Much like the some of the other reviews, about two months after we bought it; POP! The screen went blank. After a week and a half of waiting, Toshiba sent out repair people and fixed it. They replaced something they called a reflection board. Then, a month later; POP! Same problem. No picture, and now the part is on backorder. No one can tell us when it will arrive. I've been told to FAX a copy of our receipt to them and they will consider replacement. Why do I think that will take even weeks longer? We have a brand-new TV that refuses to work, and Toshiba is being zero help. SHAME on Toshiba for not recalling this piece of JUNK!

Another important and uncommon feature of this television is that splits into two pieces for easier moving.
