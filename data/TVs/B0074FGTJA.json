{"Reviews": [{"Title": "5 Stars Revised to 1 (60 inch screen review)", "Author": "Mack \"Mackharder\"", "ReviewID": "R34CUKRT794AQ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV is absolutely incredible. I got the 60 inch and bought direct from Samsung's website as I had a discount. I love the design of the actual TV, it's base is sharp looking and the TV and bezel are so thin it's going to look amazing mounted on my stone wall. The resolution and black levels are amazing. When I first saw the motion control demonstrated at Fry's when they first got them in, it looked completely unresponsive, but after getting mine, I now know why that was. The room has to be bright. They were demonstrating it in a very dim room. It doesn't see your hand movement completely if it's dark. It is totally responsive and much more fluid than I originally thought. Honestly speaking it's REALLY cool, but I doubt I'll end up using it that much, maybe for my fantasy football app during football season or when I can't find the remote and I want to turn the volume up. I bet Samsung will create a wider range of uses for the motion control through updates later on. So I feel like there is more to come from the motion control as well as the voice control.The voice control works really well. There isn't a huge list of commands, only ones on the screen, but it's neat and very impressive to people to speak to your TV, definitely peaking on the wow factor. Like I said, there aren't a ton of voice commands, but I feel this is a good base for expansion by Samsung updates.The amount of apps is plentiful and I love the fact that Samsung has introduced the Evolution Kits. What a great idea. Just a simple software upgrade instead of selling a TV when something new comes out.Now for my only negative thus far into my purchase. I rented The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo on bluray to test how good the quality of the TV really is. It's phenomenal. HOWEVER, once the screen went to black as the credits rolled you DO see spotlighting from the corners. It's weird because you don't see it when you're on non-HD channels and they black bar the left and right sides. In fact the ONLY time I've seen the spotlighting is during the credits of the movie. You don't see it in dark scenes or when the movie in letterbox format. If someone can explain why I only saw it during movie credits and not when in letterbox, that would be great. I know this TV is edgelit not backlit, so the pixels aren't turned off.All in all it's a tiny complaint for such an awesome TV that is packed with features no other TV has right now. How often are you watching just a black screen? Never. So seeing spotlighting during credits I really could careless, but for those who are completely obsessive may find it annoying. I am not going to knock down such an awesome TV a star over something like that. When you put this thing on your mantle, wall, or TV stand your jaw is going to drop at how sweet it looks even when it's off. Then you say \"Hi TV - Power On\" and wave your hand at the screen and it just gets even cooler.**UPDATE**  4/14/12Voice recognition actually has a lot more capabilities than I originally thought. When creating a Samsung account instead of remote control analog typing which can be tedious or the motion control which hurts you arm keeping it up for awhile typing out a long email, you can just say your full email address into the controller and it will get it pretty damn close. You can also say your name and all that and it did it no problem. My name is Chris, so it's not that complicated, but my last name has 2 Ts in a row and it got that somehow instead of just hearing one. Impressive. What is stupid is that you can't use the voice for entering in a URL or stuff like that. Why did they take away the QWERTY remote? Stupid. Also, to keep from having to manually log in, you can take screen shot of your face and it will log you in and all your PERSONAL setting from reading your face. That is super cool if you have people who like different settings.Exploring the app store more, there is not a whole lot there, but I expect it to grow since this TV just came out a couple weeks ago. What I am REALLY hoping for is that they bring back the Yahoo apps. The immediate predecessor TVs had Yahoo apps and this one doesn't. A big thing for me was having Yahoo Fantasy Football on screen live updating while I'm watching games. I really don't understand why they dumped Yahoo or why the app store is so scant right now. They have dozens and dozens of kid friendly apps that probably make great use of the motion control, but how does that help me with no kids. I don't care about the Kids section or Family Story. Give me my Fantasy football app. I'm not kidding, they have like 4 sports apps and 25 kids apps. COME ON SAMSUNG!! Please expand on that soon. I am still trying to figure out how to rearrange the Smart Hub, it's unclear. I'll have to check the manual I guess.I absolutely LOVE the AllShare Play. I just plug my external hard drive with downloaded movies into one of the USB inputs in the back and I got a full movie player and organizer. You can operate everything from the remote. It plays all the formats I've tested so far. Some had the volume kind of low, but if you choose the AUTO VOLUME setting it will automatically correct a volume issue.Lastly, the amount of storage space on the TV is 785mb, but I've downloaded ZERO of anything and 407mb of that space are already used. I don't even feel like THAT many apps are downloaded already. You got Facebook, VUDU, Hulu, Netflix, MLB.TV, Pandora, Youtube, MTV Music Meter, NBA Gametime, Fitness VOD and CinemaNow. That's it. Then you have the Fitness, Kids, and Family Story programs which I think is what sucks a lot of that space away. Most of the apps are 5mb and below so I guess you can still download a lot of them, but I don't know what else I may be able to download as I explore more and 785mb seems skimpy.**UPDATE** 4/15/12AND..... I got a faint vertical yellow line of pixels (very thin) across the left quarter panel of the screen. Top to bottom. At first I thought it was an entire line of dead pixels, but I turned the TV off then back on and the line was gone. Few minutes later it's back again. It goes away then it comes back. It comes back EVERY time whenever I click on the Smart Hub. Also, there is so very faint gray lines across the whole screen that you can see during light scenes. In some parts, it looks like a 3D rectangular boxing. I though it may be some interference, but it's on all channels now and it wasn't there before. It only appeared at the same time as the faint yellow line.Contrary to some other reviews knocking on Samsung's service, I called 1-800-SAMSUNG and was speaking to a live person after 2-3 button pushes. They are having a service person come out to fix it. If he can't fix it then they will exchange or refund my money they say. The entire service call was 22 minutes and that included describing what was wrong to 2 people and being on hold for 2 minutes. So as of right now, their customer service has been great. However, we'll see how the repair goes. They say I will get a call tomorrow from them to set an appointment.I changed the review from 5 stars to 2 for right now because I was SOOO careful getting this out of the box and putting it on the TV stand. I don't know if the TV is super fragile because it's so thin, but I treated it like it was regardless. Maybe it got bumped around during shipping, but there was zero box damage and it worked fine for 5 days before the line appeared. I think it was just a quality control issue. Two stars, because this thin little line coming and going is super annoying. Screen is everything. I am very tempted to give it 1 star because it's been 5 days. But if they can fix it, and it never comes back and I never have an issue again, I'll raise the review up again. I think I am the only 60 inch screen review, so watch out.**UPDATE** 4/23/12Repair company contracted by Samsung came out last Tuesday (a day after scheduling, great response time) to diagnose problem. He typed some code on the remote to do a color test. I asked how he did that, but he said it's strongly advised you don't do the color screen test yourself because you can damage your screen. Anyways, the color test makes the whole screen go red, blue, green, white, black, or a pattern of colors. When he did this we saw that on blue, all the pixels were dead in the line top to bottom, as well as little speckles of dead ones around it. It was weird because on every other color the pixels worked, so maybe just the blue pixels were dead? Maybe this is why the line looked yellow when  just watching tv. This line is so weird because it goes away sometimes. Even when it's there it's barely noticeable unless it's pointed out to you or it's a very light colored or bluish scene.The repair guy said that the screen is ruined and it needs to be replaced. I was like wtf do you mean, the screen IS the TV, it's like an inch thick. I don't fault him because he's not even a Samsung employee, he's contracted by them. This was weird. He said it's Samsung's policy to allow 10 days for a part to come in, if it doesn't come in within 10 days they exchange the TV for a new one. The repair guy said because the 60\" TV is SO new (it was the first one he'd seen) and that it was on backorder he said it was slim to none they'd get a new replacement screen in 10 days. He told me to call Samsung and tell them I don't have 10 days to waste when it's ultimately going to be the same result. When I spoke to Samsung on the phone, they didn't know what that \"10 days\" was about, but they confirmed that they have no replacement screens in stock for replacement. They are sending me a new TV and will take the old one. They said it will take 10-12 days. I don't know why people bitch about their customer service. I saw it as being great. I understand they have a process of trying to repair before they just jump into replacing. There are a lot of idiots who can't differentiate normal from defective.The issue with the TV isn't unbearable to see, so I've been fine waiting. Although this has given me more time to see some things. The fact that the TV doesn't have a keyboard is completely annoying. You will no doubt want a keyboard if you are going to websurf or do anything where you frequently input text. They sell one separately. The voice thing is very good, but not always completely accurate. When you go to Smart Hub right now it says they are updating their system on 4/24/12 from midnight to 5am and the service won't be available during that time, so maybe their ironing out some kinks. I've also noticed the spotlighting is a little more frequent than originally thought. Whenever the screen is black and their is white on the screen with no letterbox, you will see spotlighting. I'll revise my review if my new TV is perfect.**UPDATE** (5/12/12)So my order for replacement was processed and I was called today and they now said there are no 60 inches for replacement and they have to give me a refund. Fine. I just want to move on. I like the look of the TV and some cool features, but I was scared my new one was going to be shoddy as well after several warnings from other users. I got IRATE because the guy said my SALES TAX wouldn't be refunded in addition to my $60 shipping since I purchased straight from Samsung's employee website which is the manufacturer and not a retailer. If there is NO SALE, THERE IS NO TAX no matter who the hell you are. I hung up with him and called Executive Customer Service and got her to give me my sales tax, but I lost my $60 shipping. 12-17 business days for my refund after picking up the TV. So through all of this I got NO TV and LOST $60. Hence another revising of my review from 2 stars to 1 star. Samsung just does not have their crap together with their TVs lately and BELIEVE ME I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS TV. I learned a valuable lesson.Last bit about the TV before I'm done. You will be sitting in your room, push no buttons, just watching and the voice control menu or motion control will come up (unprompted) and turn down the volume on your TV till it goes away or you pick up the remote and close it. It's like a glitch or something. Annoying. I am telling everyone out there, this is straight up honest review. I am not a Samsung hater. I've owned several Samsung TVs in the past. I picked Samsung because I felt it had the best picture and they are a reputable manufacturer. I gave it 5 stars in the beginning! Then 5 days later, it messed up and now I have no TV and $60 less. I was PUNISHED for buying this TV. Don't let it happen to you.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best 60\" currently out there", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R1CTYHYVHS106B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When you move from the 55\" to the 60\"-60\"+ size, LED TV options become a bit more limited.Often its a toss up between size vs display quality.That said, purchasing the Samsung Es8000 doesn't feel like a compromise at all!######### OUT OF THE BOX #########Out of the box the picture quality is OK at best. The TV has a natural tenancy to throw to much RED filtering. The brightness vs contrast is off causing quite a bit of clipping to occure.I also had quite a lot of light bleeding around the 4 corners and a patch about the size of my hand above the SAMSUNG logo at the bottom of the screen.######### Light Bleeding #########Out of the box I had a small amount of light bleeding at the 4 corners.During the day 85% of the time it wasn't enough to bother me.That said, at night it was a different story. The light-bleeding really distracted from dark scenes in movies.This is where CALIBRATION comes into play.After calibrating my TV almost all the light bleeding vanished. I was able to find my TVs ideal black / white, brightness and backlight settings.Now there is NO visible light bleeding during the day and only a very very very small amount when viewed at night in an almost pitch black room. All LED tv's will have a small amount of light bleeding due to their design - once calibrated the Samsung ES8000 really preforms well above most current LED's out there.######### CALIBRATION IS A MUST #########Calibrating your new TV will 1) Fix a lot of the light bleeding issues and 2) Bring out the best picture of your TV !If you don't preform a simple calibration on your TV then you're wasting its potential and your money since you'll be left with a under preforming TV.Calibrating the TV yourself using a calibration DVD or Blu-Ray is very easy to do and can be done for as little as $20.I recommend using the following Calibration Disc:Disney WOW: World of Wonder [Blu-ray]Let the TV run for a few hours after you first take it out of the box and get it set up.Once the TV has been running for a while, pop in the Calibration Disc and enjoy a easy step by step walk through of your TV's settings.Calibration is easy and can always be reset if you want to start over again.######### 3D Display #########While I'm a fan of PASSIVE 3D, I've been very very pleased with this TV's ACTIVE 3D.It's been so sharp and clear with NO noticeable cross-linking in TV shows, Movies and most of my ps3 games.(Again this is after calibrating the display)The only time I noticed cross-linking was when viewing some high speed scenes in the background of Wipeout HD 3D on my PS3, but that has more to do with my old PS3 processing than the new LED TV.Also it has a lot to do with the fact that I was searching obsessively for any signs of cross-linking.######### Gesture Commands #########The voice and hand commands and hand gestures work - ok - at - best.That said, I see how the commands could really improve the User to TV interaction in the not so distant future.Preforming internet searches via voice command has its uses, but to be honest most of the time I find myself using the Bluetooth remote.Again - its all a work in progress.DON'T buy this TV if you're main reason is the voice and hand commands.Buy this TV because of its excellent colour and picture quality.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "60\" review after 5 weeks of use (had to order another one)", "Author": "Big Bad Rob", "ReviewID": "R1XJ6SYJSPFT84", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the 60\" ES8000 for about 2 weeks now.It is a nice TV.We have a 46\" ES8000 at work and I have never seen such an amazing TV, once I used it for a few hours I was hooked.The 60\" TV is really nice, it fits right above our fireplace.I used a VideoSecu Ultra Slim Thin Flat LED HDTV Fashion TV Wall Mount Bracket for 32\"-55\" LED TV VESA 200x200 300x300 400x400 up to 800x800 - Adjustable Cable Length 1Y2 to mount this TV, and it was awesome.You hang the TV like a picture with a wire and two special washers.The TV is less than 1.5\" from the front of the screen to the wall, thinner than most of our paintings we have.The picture quality is GREAT, not perfect GREAT. This 60\" has some cloudyness/bleed through in the corners that is EXTREMELY visible on dark/black backgrounds.I have read a bunch of forum replies about leaving the TV on for 100hours to get rid of that, and we are on hour 80 right now. It SEEMS to be getting better, but it could be the placebo affect going on.The 3d is awesome, Transformers and Avatar on the 60\" in 3D rock!You get 4 pairs of glasses with this TV, so it is enough for the family and friends!The Smart Hub is really cool, the application selection is a bit sparse, but it should be growing.One last thing that sold me on the TV was the expansion pack  that this TV has.It allows you to constantly upgrade your TV with whatever new technology Samsung comes out with next year, so instead of having to buy a new TV, you can buy the corresponding upgrade kit and plug it in to the expansion pack!If you have any specific questions about the 60\" please ask, I will answer in the comments.I will update as time progresses with the TV.***UPDATE****The clouding was getting pretty bad in the corners, so I contacted Samsung and they wanted to have a service center come out and service the TV. I called the service center and he said return the TV to Amazon.I called Amazon expecting a big fiasco, and was very surprised that it was extremely easy.Amazon ordered me a new one (without paying for it) and had it delivered. At the time of delivery, they returned the old one.The second es8000 is 10X better than the first one, but still not perfect. The ghosting/clouding in the corners on dark scenes is FAINTLY there. I am going to let it run for 200 hours and see if that helps, if not I will try one last es8000, before going with a different brand.It is very upsetting that Samsung has this issue, and is not doing ANYTHING about it. I never had this much trouble when I was buying 42-50\" tv's that were much cheaper. Hopefully this TV fixes itself or the third one works.......**update** 5 months in.TV is still awesome.Fixed the issues with clouding and ghosting by simply changing some settings around.Now the blacks are intensely black, like NO light black!", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good But Could and Should Be Better", "Author": "Brett A. Haberle", "ReviewID": "R4MN1X83TJXMB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*Update 5/19* Didn't notice any changes after a week of using the new update.*Update* 5/12* Samsung released another patch on 5/11 to 1017.8.  Not really sure what changes it does honestly, since Samsung uses the same update descriptions for every patch.  Will update if there is any noticeable differences.*Update 4/18* Samsung released a patch on the 15th.  It has definitely improved the voice sensitivity so it is a lot better.  In fact I don't have to yell anymore.  I will  update this post as I go.  The patch also claimed picture quality increases, \"hi tv power on\"(Which I thought the previous firmware update did), etc. too but I will play around more before I confirm that.  Still though, no updates to the gestures yet. (not that I care much).---I will rate this TV in 4 categories.  This is my first ever Samsung TV btw.  I have had to Samsung ES8000 60\" for about 17 or so days now.Picture Quality 9/10The picture is great after firmware updates and tweaking the settings.  You can see random brighter spots where the LEDs are shining in on dark scenes with the lights off.  (dinged a point.)  I still found that the color was rich, deep, and accurate.  The PS3 displays games like Journey, Flower, etc. looking beautifully.  I even tried \"Resistance 3\" in 3d mode.  It played great.  Lord of the Rings Extended Edition (Bluray HD obviously) looked wonderful as well.  I was even able to get rid of that disgusting Soap Opera effect after altering the settings (see below).Functionality 8/10 (Was 6 before updates)This is what really had me shaking my head.  The \"Touch Remote\" is garbage.  It is not friendly to use and the sensitivity is so odd to use. I forgive Samsung about the remote since they included a second one.  It doesn't change the fact that the previous year's remote was better.The voice commands are great........... if you are not listening to tv too loud (which is 90% of the time you would use these commands.)  As far as I am concerned, the hand gestures are unusable.  I managed to get it to work plenty of times, but it takes way too much time and effort.  I expect firmware updates to help address this problem though.As far as applications go, don't hold your breath.  No Amazon Video on Demand.  They do have a few good ones like Pandora, Youtube, Netflix (no issues for me), and HuluPlus.  When I use the voice command, there is a mirror app.  When I try to use it I am told to download it from the Samsung App store.  As far as I am aware, it does not exist.Also I noticed in lots of Youtube videos people would use commands like \"volume keep up\" to have the volume consistently keep going up.  I cannot get that feature to work or find anything similar.  Feel free to correct me if I am wrong about that.The speakers have trouble with certain sounds and sounds tinny (play Journey on the PS3 to find out.)  I won't hold it against the TV though because it is so skinny after all.Design  10/10This is the most gorgeous tv on the market.  The bezel is very thin just like the tv.  The stand is extremely unique.Value  8/10This TV is very expensive.  If they charge this much they should have much better functionality and a \"ready-to-go\" product with less blooming.  It did help that the price of the TV lowered greatly, even though Samsung released guidance for a much higher price.  This should be the standard price.  I have taken the current price into account with my rating.Why did I still give this TV a 4?  Because I feel most of the problems are firmware solvable.  My primary use it to watch TV, not use the hand gestures, voice command, or the bad touch remote. (And I think the former two can be improved VIA firmware.)---------------------Optimal TV Settings (Also will remove \"Soap Opera Effect\")I don't think I can post links here so simply google this, \"un55d8000 cnet calibration\"  .  Obviously that is last year's TV, but go ahead because it is close enough that those settings work well.  There were 1 or 2 settings on the directions that no longer exist, but that's fine.  I DID keep my Gamma 1 higher.If you don't wanna change your settings and just want to remove the \"Soap Opera Effect\" then simply take off \"Auto motion plus\" or set it to a custom setting of your choice.I will give a better review when I have more time.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "UN60ES8000", "Author": "OpTiMo", "ReviewID": "R3EXRORHJ6HTOU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having this TV for about two weeks now all I can say is that I'm very pleased.  The clouding is almost non existent except in the darkest of scenes and the flashlighting in the corners is not present at all on my tv.  The voice command function technology isn't quite there yet.  I set it up and while watching a movie it turned on by itself from what I can only imagine someone said something on the tv that sounded close to one of the commands.  The motion control on the tv is too unreliable to be used frequently, plus it's tiring on the arms.  But... I didn't buy this tv for those functions.  I bought this tv for the great picture and thin bezel.  The camera on top of the TV is actually pretty good when using skype or when the GF wants to mirror herself on one of her workout programs.I wouldn't think twice about recommending this tv to anyone looking for the top of the line 2012 flagship model from Samsung.  Maybe I got lucky by not having the more common problems other owners of this set have.  Either way, this tv is fantastic.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV, but SmartHub has a Major Bug in it.....", "Author": "T. J. Daugherty", "ReviewID": "R2QUG1KMARQLA2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "EDIT #2:  I've not had any additional problems with the SmartHub network identified in Edit #1.  As such I'm pushing this back to three stars and will probably call it good as Samsung has moved on to a new line of 2013 TV's anyway.EDIT #1:  I'm adjusting my rating down to 1 star from 4 due to the simple fact Samsung insists on linking their SmartHub network operations to all my TV watching options.  Let me explain:  If Samsung's \"SmartHub\" network goes down it pushes an error notification to your screen every two or three minutes.  It does this even if you are not using SmartHub, but watching cable, apple TV, DVD's, etc.  This is not cool and certainly not necessary.  Why should watching a DVD out of your personel collection require Samsung's remote network be functioning?  In an especially ironic twist, I can't watch Apple TV (which works fine) due to SmartHub networks!  When (if) they fix this I'll adjust my rating and remove this edit.Original Review:To give this some context I've now had the 60\" ES8000 for 5 days and have sampled HD cable TV, Blue Ray, and Apple TV streaming HD.Aesthetically the TV looks fantastic.  I think somewhere Samsung was inspired by Apple architecture and a less-is-more approach to style.  Deciding to wall-mount the TV I was slightly disappointed to not be able to use the stand that come with it as it is really sharp looking.  The lack of edge and thin profile invokes some iPad sensibilities when it comes to appearance.  If I were to nit-pick I'd say that the silver edge on the TV would look better with a more brushed finish than shiny, but that is really a function of style and preference.  I also think the \"samsung\" power indicator at the bottom is a bit too bright in a dark room setting.  These are minor items.I've had no issues with image quality so far.  If there are problems with with screen quality on this model I've not witnessed it, so time will tell if there were early lemons that others got stuck with.  To my eye the TV came calibrated too bright and sharp, so i've gone in and adjusted down a number of the settings.  I don't know if that is their standard factory default settings, but it was easy to adjust so I'd not consider it a real flaw.The on-screen user interface works pretty well and seems fairly easy to navigate.  I'm not sure how valuable some of the Apps are at this point, but I like the concept and assume that function will expand in time.  The TV setup was reasonable, as was the network connections (I was connecting to an Airport Express - no problems).Here's why I'm only giving this 4 stars, and what prevents this from being a Grand Slam in my opinion.....the physical user interface with the two remotes, along with Hand and Voice gestures are a bit clumsy and needing refinement.  My first reaction to seeing two remote controls was \"Why?\".  Why not make one REALLY GOOD remote, instead of two in which neither are perfect.  The basic remote is not universal, so if you're hooking up to a Set-Top Box or other accessories it's almost useless.  The touch pad universal remote was a great concept that was poorly executed.  The touch sensors are skittish and the 7-8 buttons on it really have no intuitive qualities.  At this point I'm using the universal remote supplied to me by my cable service provider.In summary the two things that were really important to me; how the TV looks, and the screen quality, have both been fantastic.  My recommendation to Samsung is to really give this user interface some additional thought.  If nothing else make a fantastic App that allows us to use tablets for navigation.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't buy or test it before..", "Author": "KennyG", "ReviewID": "R23CR65P2Q5RV8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought UN60ES8000 (60\") from a local store.I've realized \"light spots\" (white clouds) on the screen watching Star Wars. They were visible in low light and in space scenes. Called samsung and explained the issue, they said to turn the back light down to 7 and test for a week.After a week nothing changed, they've have scheduled a technician's visit. Third party technician's company called and told me that this is common problem on this style. They need to replace the LED screen or I should return it to the store.The store that I've bought TV didn't have samsung's Exchange Policy, so check it if your store has one..

Krebbs \"Krebbs\"", "ReviewID": "R14AV9LMHOOGJE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'll keep this fairly short and sweet. I did a tremendous amount of research before purchasing this 60\" TV. The picture is great although almost too bright in some cases even after precise adjustments. However, it was the best picture with the best specs after comparison with similar TVs.After installation it worked great.... for a couple of days. Now, whenever the TV is turned on, it takes a good 3 to 5 minutes (or more in some cases) before any picture shows on the screen. This is the case with any input source or even at the smart hub screen. It is not an input issue, it is definately the TV. When turned on, the screen stays black for awhile and then we begin to see really glithy ribbons of a picture. After a few of minutes of this static, then the picture kicks in and everything is fine.One other issue is the wireless receiver appears to be fairly slow. I have the fastest broadband cable internet offered by comcast, the fastest modem and wireless router available, and it still has issues with streaming feeds. No other wireless device in our home has this issue.This TV is going back. Not sure if I want to hassle with a replacement to see if this is a lemon or just move on to another brand.Update 8/18/2012: The TV is now taking about 15 minutes to turn on. I see others are having similar problems. Return has been scheduled.Update 9/4/2012: Well, I returned the TV for a replacement to see if I could get lucky and get one that was not a lemon. So far, so good. The TV turns on fine. The original one had gotten to the point where it was taking a couple of hours for a picture to appear after turning it on. This one also seems to have much better wifi connectivity. With these problems solved, I like the TV. I would revise the rating to 3 stars at this point. Thanks Amazon!Update 9/29/2012: After having the new TV on the wall for a few weeks now, I thought that I would share an update. The TV has terrible ghosting and light image around each of the side borders. For about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch along each side edge, the image is noticably lighter. Very distracting. Not what you should expect from a $3k TV. Also, the sound is almost worthless. Very tinny sound is almost unbearable. Just one problem after another. I'm not sure if I got another lemon, but I'm stuck with it now. I shared this experience with Amazon and they offered a small refund and I foolishly accepted it. I should have just sent it back. I do not recommend this TV. I wish I'd have gotten a SONY! STAY AWAY!!!!", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Support", "Author": "B.

No more light spots on the TV.  I had a really good experience with Samsung support.  I opened with online chat explaining my problem, they suggested I put in a service request (online form).  I gave them all my information and a few pictures of the problem and they were on top of it.  They called me the next business day and ordered parts based on my pictures, asked if there were other problems, and came out as soon as the parts arrived (they actually wanted to come out immediately, but I wasn't home that day).  So, good Samsung support means they get a star back (back to 4 stars now)01/21/2013 edit - Reducing my review to 3 stars because my TV has developed some light spots approximately 1 inch in diameter located approximately 2 inches from the top of the screen.  There are about 5 of them spaced evenly across the screen and they are most visible in light, solid-colored scenes.  They are not visible in complex or dark scenes.  I have opened a service request for this problem so I'll keep this post updated on the outcome.  Thankfully we have a one-year warranty... but I hate to think what other problems could develop down the road, even with a new replacement assuming I get one.  Other than that problem, the TV has been great barring the spot-lighting I referred to below (5/17/2012).05/20/2012 edit - I'm one of the few people who find the motion control helpful now.  I finally turned it on and went through the install and now use it quite a bit.  It's nice to control the TV without having to reach for the remote.  I have lots of things going on when I watch TV and I often lose track of where I put the remote.  I can just wave my hand and then choose to change the channel, volume, change sources, etc with just waving my hand.  Also, the touch mouse now works better after properly installing it.  I guess it's not setup right out-of-the-box.05/17/2012 edit - reducing by one star to 4 stars because of the spot-lighting/edge-lighting issue on dark scenes. This is the only picture flaw I have found in the month that I have had it. Great picture otherwise.I bought the low-profile hanging wall mount and installed that myself to thick drywall with the drywall kit and it worked perfectly.04/13/2012 - Just received the 60\" ES8000 today.  Apologies for the poor quality in the video: iPhone 3GS video doesn't do this justice, but it's what I have for now so you'll have to deal with it or just look at all the other video reviews of this product.  This video is playing through the YouTube app on the TV and over a 5mb/s wireless connection.So far the only issue I have is that it has to keep updating the software.  At first it wouldn't update the firmware, but it must have been working in the background because it updated automatically while I was trying to download to USB from the Samsung site on my computer to transfer to the TV.  Other than that update, it keeps updating the Apps menu so it has all the latest services.  I guess this is to be expected and it's probably not going to need constant updates once it gets through this initial phase.  For some reason I cannot get to the Samsung Apps store yet.  Probably needs another software update for that.Other than that, the picture is amazing.  No issues whatsoever with dead pixels or blemishes anywhere.  The backing had no problem like one other review so that's a relief.  Just an amazingly beautiful product.The web browsing is a bit clunky with the remote so I'm looking forward to getting a wireless keyboard and mouse for it.  But I can get to my favorite video sites and it plays the free stuff like a champ.I do see some edge lighting when the screen goes black between transitions.  I have not played with any settings yet so hopefully that doesn't become distracting.Will post updates as necessary.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good TV", "Author": "Fly2high \"Fly2High\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q7KOB9NDC5EF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to compare at home a Panasonic 55VT50, the so called top rated plasma from the 2012 HDTV Shootout to this one.  I hooked them both up to my DVR, one via HDMI and the other via component.  Since Best Buy offers a liberal return policy, I did the comparison at home right where they were to be used, side by side.  When one looked worse, I switched cables to ruleout the cables being the issue.I found the viewing angle of the Panasonic to be better but even though they were both hooked up to the same DVR (FIOS), the Samsung looked much sharper.  I turned the Panasonic's sharpness all the way up and down and could not get the picture as sharp.When I was watching Despicable Me at the end where they are trying to reach the farthest, the plasma looked grey whereas the Samsung was much whiter.  The plasma could not get the whites as white.  Also, during the rolling of the credits on a movie, the Panasonic was stuttering while the Samsung was scrolling cleanly.  The LED Samsung also could get much brighter than the plasma.Both have 3D but the depth on the Samsung is much deeper than on the Panasonic even when the depth is turned up all the way.The Samsung is not perfect.  the voice controls really work best when talking into the touch remote or within 9 or 10 ft or less and needs a rather quiet room.  If you use the microphone on the touch remote, it works very well but once you have a remote, why would you bother talking in commands.  They should make a remote microphone to enlarge the area usable for voice commands.The gesture controls work but, if you are Italian like me, you might find them going on occasionally. It really wasn't that often.I do see the clouding or flashlight effect in the corners but it only shows when the screen is nearly black.  The autodimming prevents it most of the time and when the picture is black, it shuts off the light.  It is not at all noticeable during normal viewing.  I find myself using either natural or movie mode and tend to keep the back-light down around 7-10.  That pretty much prevents it from coming out even during nearly dark credits.  Clouding/flashlight is really only noticeable during the credits on some movies.I chose the Samsung because the sharpness was better and the 3D was better and the set was much brighter.  I could not see any real difference in color or black level in my living room even though the black levels are metered to be darker on the Panasonic plasma.  I couldn't find a movie to show it.  I tried Sanctum, Green Lantern and Avatar.  In fact, during the scene where he first meets the girl and she saves him from those jackals and extinguishes his torch, the colors are sooo much more vibrant on the Samsung.  they felt muted and did not jump off the screen like on the Samsung.  Also, no tuning could make the Panasonic pop or show the whites as white as on the Samsung.Add to the fact that you get 4 universal 3D glasses with the Samsung, tons of apps, less wattage(LED 84-124 to 219-300 plasma) and a bigger screen, we decided that we could live with the shortcomings of the Samsung more than we could with the lack of brightness, lower and noticeable lack of sharpness and grey whites of the plasma.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "overall a great TV for the current price. Best Black level for LED edge lit", "Author": "howie", "ReviewID": "R23BI80L1CZVYE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i've had the TV for about a week now. based on research and experience i would say the majority of the one or two star negative reviews here are from 65inch models, please refer to \"Additional Comment\" below. for me this was an upgrade exchange from ES6500 which had the infamous green halo trail. i got the 60ES8000. overall i would say the TV is great for its current street price.Pros:1. strong black level performance due to Micro Dimming. beautiful beautiful black. one of the best blacks i've seen for LCD/LED sets.2. best design esthetics. no need to elaborate more. it speaks for itself.3. best color representation right out of the box without too much tinckering. but of course if you're one of those who is hardcore about calibrating, you'll end up calibrating it anyway. but i am not that anal, although having work in the motion picture VFX industry, i do have a pretty trained eye and picky about quality. the set is pretty accurate and true right out of the box.4. slightly better viewing angle than other edge lit LED sets.5. Super Bright, and Super awesome contrast ratio. it even made my last ES6500 looked bad.6. Dynamic contrast preserves over 95% of details even in medium setting, thanks to its 500 sub region micro dimming capability. i tested it with color and gamma palettes, even in medium setting, the color information is still preserved. unless you go all the way into HIGH, which starts to crush some shadows.7. minimal to none clouding/flash lighting issues. with micro dimming on, it's completely none issue.Cons:1. slight screen uniformity issue. slight back light bleed in rare occasions. Thanks to Micro Dimming. most of the back light bleed are eliminated. the only time you'll see slight back light bleed is a thin edge of bleeding will appear on both lef/right side of the screen when hovering over a neutral color. but in all of the dark scenes back light bleed isn't an issue at all thanks to Micro Dimming.2. slight DSE/banding toward both left/right side of the screen. i only found this out when i started looking for it. and once i found it, it's hard not to forget. do yourself a favor, don't look for it. i now also find some banding on all my other monitors and TV's around the house. the banding isn't bad, and you probably won't notice unless you start looking for it. so don't.Additional comment: overall, it's a great TV. based on my previous research, it seems that if you stay away from the 65 inch set, which has the most amount of screen uniformity issue, you should be ok. i honestly couldn't find anything wrong with it the first few days. it was until i started doing all the test, and started \"looking\" for flaws and i found some slight banding. honestly once i found the banding, i went and look for it on my old 46inch TV set that the ES8000 replaced, i found worse banding on the old one, which to my surprise i never noticed for the past 6 years. so now i wish i had never went and looked for those issues, because now psychologically, you always tell yourself there is slight banding at a certain place, and you look for it. maybe as time goes by, i'll forget about it. in case if you're wondering if the banding is as bad as those example pictures of 65 inch on AVS forum, no, it is not. i can still watch hockey without noticing any, unless you start looking for it.EDIT: 2/26/2014do yourself a favor, pick up an Xrite Colormunki, or Xrite i1Display Pro. if you think the image is awesome on this set, wait until you calibrate it with the meter. it'll blow your mind. you'll need to use the meters with HCFR calibration software, which is free. the white balance on this set, like all other tvs in the market, are off. color temp out of factory in movie mode is over 9000 Kelvin. and there's excess Blue and Green across all color scale. Red and yellow are actually pretty accurate out of the factory. but after you calibrate it and get the white balance to D65, and using CMS on your tv to match all color reference points, the image is breath taking. i actually got a even blacker black level after calibration, and overall better perceived contrast (without the excessive blue tint).", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN60ES8000", "Author": "Jim Savoy \"Simple Jim\"", "ReviewID": "R1L7O235DTBDZF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't get the negative reviews, granted this type of unit must be calibrated to achieve a nominal viewing performance. For the unfamiliar user this could seem a daunting task but there are numerous web sites to visit to retrieve all the information necessary to do a quality in home calibration, I used this one coupled with my personal tastes, AVS forum.I suppose the bells and whistles are a little over the top, the hand motion coupled with the camera is a little weird, but the access to Apps is relatively easy to navigate as is the personalization. The voice controls work.....no issues there. Clearly this type technology is the future of television viewing, internet connected, streaming and personalization.The picture quality for me is excellent, viewing angles are better then previous Samsung units and the sound is better then older Samsung versions, not to say it's great though.3D is very good, it's such a personal issue....but it works for me.The design is amazing, the bezel is the thinnest in the business and the stand is very attractive. The connections are easily accessible and the basic remote is simple, the voice and motion remote takes a little getting use to.

The 3D is as good as it gets. I run the 3D movies through my PS3 as it has 3D capability and does very well with this format.As mentioned in other reviews, when the scene on the TV is very dark/black, there is some \"cloudiness\" seen, but you kind of have to look for it. If you are engrossed in the movie or show as the case may be, chances are you may not even notice. You have to look for it. Kind of like that little itch you have, normally you don't notice it, but if you concentrate on it then it may bug you, otherwise not an issue. For some people this may be a non starter, but realistically, what percentage of your TV watching is a predominately black/dark scene or background?

This is a great overall performer.  I've owned a number of high end Samsung TV's including a couple of 3D plasma TV's.  This one trumps the plasmas.  The whites are much brighter and truer compared to a comparable plasma TV where whites are almost gray.  The micro-dimming ultimate and increased black levels are definitely noticeable over my 55C8000 Samsung.  Yes, black levels are not as good as they are on my 7 series Plasma, but it's very rare that I'm watching TV in complete darkness so this doesn't matter to me.The new voice and gesture control may be gimmicky to some, but I will be the first to admit that they are incredibly handy and accurate.  There is nothing better than walking into your living room and saying \"Hi TV, power on\" and having the TV on before you sit down.  The voice control also allows you to tell the TV to change channels, volume, and a handful of other commands without ever leaning forward to grab the remote.  (Very handy when eating!).  The gesture controls are great too.  It took me a day or two to figure out how to do the motion control properly.  You don't wave your hand like the advertisements show, you just hold your hand up and make sure there's some lighting in the room to illuminate it.  The voice and gesture controls sync with your cable box, making them useful... rather than useless.3D is nicely improved over the two 2011 3D Samsung's I own.  The TV comes with four pairs of bluetooth glasses that never lose connection if you look away from the TV like the old IR models do.  They're also very light and fit over eyeglasses well.  The 3D effect itself seems crisper and more pronounced.The app market is also a nice improvement and contains a number of board games like Monopoly, the Game of Life, and others.  Good for sitting around with a group of people.  Angry Birds is also fun with the motion control and comes free with the TV.The new touch remote isn't all that great, and I wish this TV included last years special remote with the keyboard on the back.  Although the touch remote makes web browsing much easier (think laptop trackpad), the typing is still a chore because you have to select each letter separately.  You can always sync your Samsung phone to the TV though (Galaxy models, Focus models for WP7, etc), this enables you to use your phone's keyboard to type.Other features that I haven't tried yet but may be nice are; connectivity to a wireless printer so you can print directly from web pages, Skype functionality with the built in camera, and facial recognition that can bring up each person's individual Skype phone book, app preferences (I think), etc.Overall this is a great performing TV in terms of picture quality, but also adds some great extras that you just wont get on a high end Sony TV.Pull the trigger now while the price is LOW!", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very attrictive TV with lot of fun features", "Author": "J. Boyle", "ReviewID": "R2EKWQFJ00GQNE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the Samsung UN60ES8000 from a Samsung LN52A750.  I took advantage of Amazons free shipping.  It arrived a few days before the expected due date and had the, \u201cWhite Glove\u201d service!  I was most impressed with the delivery people care that ensured that the TV was in working order before they left.I\u2019ve used the 8000 for around 3 months now.  The TV is beautiful with the thin silver colored bezel with very narrow black edges. The stand complements the TV.The TV came with a standard remote control and a touch pad remote control.  I much prefer the standard remote over the touch pad remote, and a remote control extender.  With the extender I have my Blu-ray and satellite DVR programmed so it matches my satellite service channel line-up.  This is a nice feature. The touch pad remote is sluggish execution responses when touching the pad.  The touch pad remote control is not as user friendly when filling in data fields with letters and numbers.  I used the Motion Control and Voice Control, I find neither beneficial. Using voice control via the touch remote gives best results.I rate the Picture quality with a \u201cB\u201d.  If the quality of the program is top notch, the video quality is exceptional.  If the program is less than average due to being over compressed or having a low bit rate, digital artifact becomes evident. The LED/LCD has robust color, great contrast and brightness.  I\u2019m impressed with the quality of standard definition content. The viewing angle is narrower than my replaced CCFL/LCD.  I have a smaller LED/LCD TV.  It like this TV has the same narrow viewing angle.  This may be caused by the LED back lighting (edge lighting process) and the much thinner encasement width.  When moving to the either side if the TV, I see is the increase of white saturation similar to high Chroma.  At greater side viewing angles the washout becomes very evident.  I have not had the 8000 professionally calibrated.I have Dish Network receivers.  I find that channel video quality is not always equal.  Some channels have slight judder when the Auto Motion is set to \u201cStandard,\u201d or \u201cSmooth\u201d.  Changing it to \u201cClear\u201d fixes the problem 100%, but makes the picture look flat as compared to \u201cStandard\u201d that makes the picture look more realistic (or the soap opera effect).  Using the \u201cSmooth\u201d setting actually increases judder on some channels.  \u201cSmooth\u201d should make the picture smooth.  I\u2019ve tried different user settings and can emulate Samsung\u2019s presets, but can\u2019t get it any better.Using the Smart Hub internet features is remarkable.  The picture quality of the HBO-GO & VUDU applications is close to perfect.  I have not used every feature application in the Smart Hub but can attest that the video quality is exceptional for some applications.  I\u2019m a Netflix subscriber and use the Netflix app.  The video quality for the Netflix app is disappointing.  This application causes what others describe as blooming in the four corners of the screen with dark to black scenes.  Data streaming may be slower making the picture looks softer with an increase in macro blocking.  Samsung and Netflix need to work on and improve this application.I using the 3D feature with Dish Network VOD programs.  The quality is average, depth could be better.  I compared quality with my 32\u201d 3D VIZIO that has passive 3D.  The VIZIO 3D has more field of depth; the 8000 has a much better viewing angle.  My biggest complaint about the 3D is that there is occasionally a good amount of side reflection of image, usually to the left of a 3D object (like there is a pane of glass next to the object reflecting a ghost image of the object when the 3D effect is set to Auto).  Using the 3D Auto setting also causes side banding to increase and decrease depending on how much 3D content is present.  Using the 2D to 3D feature is amazing.  The quality is remarkable.The included 3D glasses work well, however other surrounding light sources will introduce lens flicker.  Corrective lens glasses are hard to position while using the included 3D glasses.  I don\u2019t have a 3D player however playback of Blu-Ray videos provided outstanding picture quality which makes me believe that 3D would be much better when using Blu-Ray.  There is occasionally some white side banding when I first start VOD 3D playback. I found that I can eliminate it either by stopping and starting the 3D program.The audio quality is average with the built in speakers.  I\u2019ve tried modifying the sound setting for the TV speakers.  Quality is not improved.Network setup is easy.  Using either WiFi or connecting an Ethernet cable proves positive.  There are no problems.This TV has Eco friendly user options.  I don\u2019t use them because the TV is quite energy efficient with the standard settings.  When room lighting compensation setting is used, the picture dims to dark for my liking, even in a dimly lighted room.Module upgrades are part of the design for this TV that attach to the back.  I\u2019m curious to learn what features and upgrades will be made available.I recommend this HDTV for those who have an unlimited budget.

I have now had my TV over 90 days so lots of reviewing time.This TV is beautiful, and looks amazing mounted on a wall with a thin mount display.  The Sanus Extra Thin works great with this TV.  The minimized bezel and clean lines make this a work of art even when it is off.

Still so beautiful and one of the best on the market and certainly at this price range.I did not find the smart remote provided to be intuitive but thankfully Samsung likely figured this out and provides a standard remote as well that I found much easier to use.One of the major disappointments has been that Samsung has chosen to no longer to offer compatibility with their remote app for IPhone users.  This app is awesome and allows you to control the TV via an app on your phone.  It appears because these companies are now not playing nice with each other, they are taking it out on the consumers and the IPhone app no longer works with the latest TV software updates.

The image quality is pure, clean, and so lifelike that the perception to the eye is that you are looking out your own window. The 3d effect is excellent, and has a sense of depth that implies the TV is 10 feet deep. The setup is time consuming, but once you have it all set up, it DOES work as advertised. So...why only a 2 star review? Simple. The problems we have with the TV are in it's construction. I hate to do it, but I am going to be returning my 2nd of these due to major flaws in how they put it together. It looks appealing when it is on. BUT...the problem is, at the factory, they over tighten the screws that attach the various parts, and the bezel, which is enough to distort the Gorilla Glass badly. The first one arrived, with about 8  6 inch \"bowls\" of distortion, and when the TV is off, and the light of day is shining into our family room, it is really annoying. Not a little bit, rather seriously irritating. My wife commented on it, and we returned the first one. The second arrived last week, and has the identical same problem. BOTH TV's also had a problem with corner stars...meaning in a dark room, at night, while switching between sources, and black is displayed on the screen, white stars shoot out out from each corner. The first TV was much worse, but between them both, we have to say, this is a consistent problem, and though we would love to consider this done, and move on to other things, it is NOT done. It makes me wonder where the quality control is at the factory, and why they are tightening screws so much that it ruins the display. This is not a new issue. I had this happen to a SONY Bravia XBR2 I bought 6 years ago, though loosening the screws relaxed it, and the problem went away.  On these displays, no such luck.  For 3500 bucks at point of purchase (now 3199 average) it ought to be perfect.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm concerned", "Author": "Bob Harrington", "ReviewID": "RVYWWW9Q164L1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Amazon delivered my UN60ES8000 at 10:30 AM Friday, July 27, 2012. The two Pilot Freight Services reps had it out of the box sitting on its pre-installed floor stand and operating acceptably within 10 minutes.Getting my components plugged in and operating well together took another half-day or so.Since I am a Comcast subscriber, getting my High Def 3D converter/DVR slaved to my new TV and working with my Comcast remote and other Samsung component equipment was critically important. The two remotes Samsung included in their TV package were approximately worthless other than you need the Menu button on the Samsung TV remote to make adjustments to settings for picture, sound, etc. Once I had those programmed the way I wanted them, I fell back to using my tried-and-true Comcast remote to select all functionality.Surprisingly, the Samsung HW-E450 Sound Bar which came as part of my $2,997.99 bundle does improve the sound quality some on Movie mode yet it cannot be turned ON by my Comcast remote; OFF yes, ON no. And, while the sound bar does have a dim display showing the sound level in numbers, the TV screen only shows that you are increasing or decreasing the sound level, not the numeric value of the level. This feature could be fixed with a simple Samsung software upgrade, but I'm not holding my breath.My concerns began with my careful reading of the 50 or so Amazon reviews for this TV before I bought it. Given my excellent experiences with several Samsung TV products over many years, Samsung got the benefit of the doubt. The jury is still out whether my faith in Samsung quality control will be rewarded or not. I certainly have faith, and wonderful experiences, with Amazon.About 12:30 PM last Sunday, August 12, my TV picture would not turn ON. The ON function worked so that the Samsung SmartTV logo appeared within 3 seconds, and the HDMI1 logo a couple of seconds thereafter, but NO PICTURE came on within 5 seconds as it had every time for the prior 2-week burn-in period. After trying a half-dozen times to turn my TV ON with no success, I called Samsung Support 1-800-726-7864. After enduring their lengthy telephone tree and getting cut-off once, I finally was connected to a live support rep. While she seemed clueless, she did write down my TV symptoms and started the process of scheduling local tech support for a prem visit between 8 AM and Noon on Thursday, August 16 (4 days away).At exactly 2 PM that same day, my TV magically came to life. Evidently (and fortunately), I had left the power ON without realizing it. Using the Menu, I investigated various time-related settings, but could find none toggled ON that logically might have caused my TV problem. Nonetheless, I toggled every time-related and energy-saving setting OFF. Motion and voice control (really annoying) were already OFF.Since then, so far, so good.TV Unlimited 1-408-733-6913, the local tech support vendor contracted by Samsung to provide premise services in Silicon Valley has phoned to say they have two replacement parts (a new power supply and control board) they think may solve the problem my TV symptoms indicate. The TV Unlimited tech is due out tomorrow.Currently, I am giving this Samsung TV 3 stars since I do not favor negative surprises with premium solid state products like this. I will keep you posted as my saga plays out.Update Aug 16, 2012: As recommended by another reviewer, I called off the service tech and am returning the Samsung TV for a refund to Amazon within their 30-day return window. It is being picked up next Tuesday. In the end, it was more trouble to accommodate a tech to service the TV than it was to return it to Amazon. And then, I would never be sure that the tech fix was really a fix, or just postponing another failure.About Sep 1, my plan is to order something to fill the now-gaping hole in my TV cabinet wall. It may be a Samsung UN60ES8000 again from Amazon, hoping for no more negative surprises. In the meantime, I am open to suggestions for a 60-inch 3D HDTV that may be better than this Samsung product.

The black levels should be called deep gray levels. Also notorious for Samsung is getting LED white glare in the corners during dark scenes which are worse on this year's highest end TV compared to Samsung previous year's middle of the road. When I called an ultra high end audio / video store which charges $250 for calibration of EACH INPUT said, it's not worth the money. That it will not fix the poor blacks and LED white glare. It may improve it slightly but it's inherent to the TV design. I'm returning the TV and opting to buy a full array LED backlit TV or a plasma TV.Voice control - one word to describe it \"junk\". The only words that work are \"power on\" and that s only part of the time. I've had my family and friends try it. Out of 6 people standing within 6 feet its works about 20% of the time. Once sound is coming from the TV and voice commands are attempted the results go down even further.In summary, I rate this TV a 1 star purely on the aesthesis of the TV. It's the only thing going for it. My guess is that Samsung took its highest end TV from the previous year, made it thinner which hurt the picture quality and added voice and gesture control to drive sells. For $3,200 consumers want a quality picture first and foremost. This TV on picture alone should retail for $1,600. The voice and gesture control don't work and add no value.

The rep said it shipped out of South Carolina and that I should give it 5 business days. She also said it was sent via USPS (not UPS as they said in previous calls). At this point my TV had not been working for 3 weeks and the thumb drive had not arrived. I had also been told that it was shipping out of 3 different states and 2 different mail carriers. I had also asked for a tracking number at each phone call and was told that it wasn't available. After giving my address to the rep, she noticed that they had the wrong house number in their system. This was their mistake and only caught at the 4th phone call. So I asked to speak with a manager. The manager told me they would expedite the thumb drive and that I would receive an email later that day with a confirmation. I never received an email.I called the next day to tell them that I never received the email. I was then told that the software update COULD BE EMAILED to me. Are you kidding me? I had spent hours on the phone with Samsung customer service and waited 3 weeks without a working TV to then be told that I could have received the update via email.They emailed me the update and the TV worked for 2 weeks. Now it is doing the same thing as before. A technician is scheduled to come by and fix the TV next week. I has now been almost 2 months of not having a TV work that I paid a lot of money for.Samsung's customer service department is totally incompetent.

However, given the price point this TV sells at, I would expect Samsung to have better QC and ensure that these sets have minimal to no clouding and flashlighting.  Sadly, this was not the case for me.  You, however, may be more lucky and have no issues with clouding or flashlighting.The Bad:- The first TV I purchased from Amazon had very bad flashlighting and clouding.  I exchanged it for the same model, and the second still had the same issues, albeit not quite as bad.  This is a deal breaker for me.  I'm returning for a different model.  Thank god for Amazon's awesome return policy.- 3D mode cranks up the brightness even more, so if you have issues with flashlighting you will notice it more during 3D movies.- TV randomly rebooted a few times, especially when using the Smart TV interface.- Do yourself a favor and turn off the voice control and gesture control.  If not, you risk the TV randomly deciding that you are trying to control it with your voice and/or hands.- Only 3 hdmi inputs.  All of my components go through my receiver, but I expect at least 4 inputs on a high end model- Horizontal viewing angles are just ok (imo).  It wasn't a huge issue for me, but for others it might be.  Watching off angle can wash out the color or make blacks look grey.- Glossy screen can be somewhat distracting in a bright room- As at least one other person has mentioned, the power cable is too short.  I don't know what Samsung was thinking here.The Good:- Picture, other than clouding and flashlighting, was very nice.  Blacks were pretty good for an LCD, especially edge-lit.  Colors were good after calibration.  Do yourself a favor and turn on the eco sensor.  This will dim the backlight in a dark room and help minimize flashlighting and clouding.  I also recommend you use the Disney WOW blu-ray to calibrate the picture.  It's very easy to use, and calibrating really helps take the picture to another level.- Tested 3D with Transformers and was pretty impressed.  I'm not a fan of the included 3D glasses, though.  I wear prescription glasses and found them a bit cumbersome to wear.- No dead pixels- wifi was simple to set up and worked great on my network- I did not detect noticeable lag during gaming.- independent adjustments for judder and blur.

The last time I counted, my set restarted 17 times in 3 minutes.  This is simply unacceptable in a high end set like the ES8000 series.

The flashlighting and clouding from the backlight are so severe that it makes it nearly unusable at night.  I have tried lowering the backlight level to extremely low levels with no success of eliminating the problem.  As a married individual that works during the day, the only time I can play my video games are at night after the wife goes to sleep so keeping a light on is not possible nor should it be a requirement.

We are still really happy that we made this change.  We are like children watching 3D movies and the 3D function was not an important part of our decision.  We love the beauty of the picture and it has allowed us to sit in the same room again to watch tv.

Now when powered on it works fine for about 15 min then the picture is replaced with multiple vertical colored lines all over the screen .  After awhile the TV automatically turns itself off and then back on and then the colored lines cover the screen again and TV goes off/on again.  The same process repeats as explained over and over and over and over....  The only way to stop it is to pull the plug.  After pulling the plug and letting it rest for several hours the same process repeats.Called Amazon to exchange the TV and I was told its outside their 30-day exchange period and so I could either get 50% of my purchase price back from Amazon or keep it and take up the problem with Samsung.  Samsung repair man is scheduled for tomorrow.Oh joy, paid full price for a new TV and will probably end up with a refurbished one.

Bottom line, awesome tv with a great picture. My only complaint is that it isn't full LED, but unfortunately, is only edge lit. Being edge lit, there is a little light bleed. Nowhere near as bad as lesser models, but still noticeable.All in all, for a tv that's under $3,000, it's one of the best, but if absolute perfection is what you're after, I'd look for a full array LED set instead, but plan on spending the $ for it. Those sets start at $5,000 for the 55\" models. I think Sony and Pioneer each have one.As far as all the other stupid \"Smart\" features, they make work well, but I can't stand all that stuff, so I disabled every bit of it.Also, do yourself a favor and get the tv custom calibrated.

Called Amazon and they were so nice about trying to fix it themselves so I didn't need to call Samsung myself but it still came to a point were Samsung wanted to deal with me directly.

I got a call they already placed the order for the missing 3D glasses...that was June 1, 2012...guess what...Today is Aug. 13,2012 and haven't rec'd the glasses...called them and they said it is backordered...promised to update me as soon as they have the order in.

I can't seem to get either of these features to work well in my living room, but I don't think I'd ever really use them.

Tv is very thin, light and stunning appearance.I've had 46\" samsung lcd tv for about 2 years and it is good, but I wanted a bigger and thinner led tv as I always watch 720p movies and HD Channels.The problem is, I am using a laptop connected to my tv to watch hd channels.There was no problem with my lcd, but today when I connected it to that 60\" led tv, I realized that there is vibration on scrolling text, and also the picture quality is not as good as my lcd tv.I tried some calibration by myself but it was still same so I searched for other calibration options and applied some of them that I found, but they haven't worked out either. Red is very shiny, faces are not CLEAR.I tried hd cable, hd movie but I couldt get the expected picture quality.I saw that WOW calibration bluray and ordered it. Does anyone have an idea that bluray can help me ?I really cannot feel comfortable while watching it . The screen is cloudy at the back, and not clear.I always use the laptop connected to tv to watch tv, soccer games, movies so I need the best picture quality for that .I thought that as the screen size is bigger, hdmi connection has failed that much. Or its not that good because of being led tv.Also this must be much better than 46\" samsung lcd.Is it because the laptop connection ?  Is it because of 60\" ? What do I need to do ? Should I return it back and get a lcd ?Waiting for comments ..

It seemed to me that either the Samsung WMN2000B or WMN200C would be ideal.  Online information was contradictory as to which one would work the 60-inch set,and compatibility was only listed for 2010 and 2011 models, not 2012.Multiple queries to Samsung have gotten me absolutely nowhere: refusing to help at all, contradicting themselves, telling me to ask J&J; International (Samsung Parts), and finally telling me that they don't have mounts for 2012 models so I should pick any VESA 400x400 model.  And of course, telling me that the information is in either the manual or the website.Per their suggestion, I queried Samsung Parts, which told me they cannot answer me since the mounts were only branded Samsung, not made by Samsung, and I should go back and ask Samsung.I have never found a manufacture so unwilling to recommend an accessory for a paying customer.  Let me take a different approach.Which slim mounts have people here used, and how did they work out?Postscript (5/26/2012):I want to thank the people who commented on my review; there were some promising suggestions.  For now, I am still intrigued by the Samsung slim mounts, so I ordered both the WMN2000B and the WMN2000C.  It says right on the box for the WMN2000B that it is works with the 2012 Samsung LED ES7000 and above 46\"-60\", despite Samsung's claims that I should order the WMN2000C, or that neither works, or that I should ask SamsungParts, who would not help at all.  I contacted them again, pointing this out, and they again sent me useless replies, not even vaguely acknowledging the specific content of my query.  I guess customer support though the internet is not a big thing at Samsung.As to the TV itself, I would say that for high definition content, the picture quality is at least as good as a Sony LCD set that I bought around 5 years ago, and probably slightly better.  For non-high definition content, the picture quality is definitely worse.  The sound quality is also a lot worse, but I guess this is why most people end up getting external speakers for these thin TVs.
