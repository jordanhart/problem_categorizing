LCD, LED, Plasma oh my! I have a basic 50\" LCD in the bedroom, but wanted something with a little more punch for the living room. This is definitely the punch! I couldn't imagine watching TV at home with glasses on (for 3D), but after a few minutes of some incredible 3D from Netflix I forgot I had them on. Wifi set up with ease on 5GHz dual band router that is upstairs. I really like the Magic Remote but I put the LG TV Remote app on my phone and it works flawlessly. Haven't used it with my tablet yet. I posted to Facebook from my TV last night for the first time...while watching TV. The Social Media app (I think that's what it's called) let's you have them side by side. Nice!I have played movies from USB, Netflix, and streamed from my computer all without any flaws. This plays a wider range of files than a media player I previously purchased for my other TV. I've used the web browser and it's faster than my daughter's laptop. Checked out YouTube, installed an app to play chess, the only thing I haven't found is Amazon Prime but I knew that from reading reviews here before I purchased. There is way too much to praise in this review and way too much I have yet to experience.I'm slowly learning how to get rid of the Soap Opera effect, thanks to some other reviews. The TV's sound was actually pretty good considering the slim size of the set. But I connected a Boston Acoustics TVee25 soundbar to make the experience even better. I wanted to connect my older surround sound system but this set has no analog output. And it shouldn't!This is my first 3D/Smart TV and it wasn't my first choice. I had reserved a Panasonic for pick up, but met with an informed salesman (which is rare these days) and he was able to expound on the research I had already done. And I am grateful he did because this model wasn't even on my list. This is way more than a TV and I am extremely pleased! It comes with 6 pair of glasses and I just ordered some more - my two year old is having a hard time keeping them on.I was going to mount this on the wall because I don't like TV stands. But even the stand on this is nice. I have it on a black table and it almost looks like the TV is floating above the table. It only swivels 10 degrees each direction but that's not an issue for me. Plus, I stood across the room and \"tested\" how well I could see at angles and it looked good to me until I was at 180 degrees of course.I'm writing my review because I was helped tremendously by the reviews here. After the salesman showed me the LG 55LM6200 I came here and started reading. Thank you all for taking the time to share your experience. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because nothing is perfect. But this is close. Lol. I hope this helps someone.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG 55LM6200 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses", "Author": "S. Dancer", "ReviewID": "RV9EC1KMJSQKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful LED, 3-D, \"SMART\" television.  I am not sure about all the hubbub and complaints wrt the white spots, ghosting, or black levels (whatever that is) nor the 120 Hz problem when no one broadcasts over 60 Hz right now anyway (according to Consumer Reports), but I respect technical expertise.  This is my 2nd LG LED TV purchase, and once again I feel like I purchased a great TV at an awesome price, with a wonderful picture and chassis.  The 3-D both delivered AND converted is a hit out of the park!  The kids love it and frankly, so do I.  I am going to buy another one of these for our upstairs game room when they come down in price just a bit more, because the kids have taken over mine each night with their games and 3-D movies.  OK by me, love having them spend time with me and be home safe, keeps them off the streets.  They don't want to watch my 52\" JVC rear projection up in the game room anymore, they say the picture by comparison is simply not as good, and the JVC is \"Not as nice\", as this LG, and the JVC is only 9 years old!!I have this LG TV hooked up to my 15 year old Bose Lifestyle 5 Surround system with REDLINE surround speakers and an Acoustamass Module via an inexpensive Optical/digital converter I purchased here on Amazon (You will need this type of converter if your surround system is still Analog RCA input because the LG TV sports Optical sound output), and the sound is phenomenal!!  Feels like we are in a theatre when we watch movies, and NFL football is incredible, it sounds like you are in the huddle with them!!  I have the same Bose unit upstairs and will purchase the converter again for that when the time comes.  You can find that converter here:http://www.amazon.com/SANOXY-Digital-Optical-Converter-Adapter/dp/B005DIRI6I/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleYou will also need this cable to hook up the Optical converter to the TV.http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Digital-Optical-Audio-Toslink/dp/B001TH7GSW/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleBottom line.... this is a great LED, 3-D, Smart TV for the price range (I did hours upon hours of 3-D, internet capable TV research before purchasing this one), and the 3-D glasses are awesome being passive and cheap to purchase.  I like having to only use the magic wand remote along with my Direct TV remote.  After a month now, all APPS are up to date and everything works as advertised, even Pandora!Btw, I had originally purchased the LG 55\" Plasma TV months ago and my electric bill went up pretty high each month I had it.  Once I purchased this one in replacement, my electric bill came back down as well.  Some Amazon users beat up my product review pretty bad on that TV saying that, that was impossible, the TV was rated at this or that annual power consumption and that I was on drugs, so I removed the review.  But I will tell you I have the electric bills, purchase date, and return date to prove my claim.  Now I am not sure if there was something wrong with that particular set and that is what caused the excessive power consumption or what, but it happened, and I wont be purchasing a plasma any time soon.  Besides, the picture of this TV is far superior to the LG 55\" Plasma, and it had a 600 Hz refresh rate.In this day and age with the economy the way it is, I cannot see spending more than $1200 on an advanced large screen television.  It is only for entertainment, and there is much more around the house and in my kids education I can be investing in, that will be fruitful in the future.  Years ago I would have purchased the most expensive Sony or whatever brand simply because it was the hottest thing on the street and no one else had it.  Well, my 52\" JVC TV up in the game room was just that 9 years ago, and now look at it's future......Please respect my review.  This is not a political debate, I don't desire any Subject Matter Expert replies about what black levels are, nor that there ARE actually programs in 120 Hz, I have already purchased this unit and I am honest and very happy with my purchase.  If you have technical expertise or a disagreement with me, make your point on your product review and respect my opinion as I have others.  If you would like to ask questions I would be happy to reply to any and all inquiries.God Bless America!!!!", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Spectacular 3d performance", "Author": "JJP", "ReviewID": "R2KQA1XGNEPTZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With all of the options why by this TV?*Passive 3d is best in class performance with cheap battery free glasses*LED is the lowest power consumption technology about $15 a year vs 60-70 for Plasma*Super thin, looks like a poster on the wall*Magic remote is pretty cool*Great viewing angle*Solid SmartTV apps*Auto sensing HDMI inputs*Great picture in SD, HD and 3D* Ability to display split screen video games in full screen is very cool*White glove delivery from Amazon is great", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "55 lm6200 bells n whistles", "Author": "270bamf", "ReviewID": "R3A7ZAC8PC1MMK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Beautiful tv with beautiful picture.

Roehm", "ReviewID": "R2IT2UX77GG4T5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The main reason I purchased this model was because the dimensions were perfect for fitting just right into my entertainment center furniture.  There's only a quarter inch left on each side so it fills the space just right.The picture quality is as good as any others.  Looking at the TVs in the stores it's hard for me to tell much of a difference.  As for the features, a salesman in Bestbuy recommended that I get a TV that had wifi and apps so I would be ready for the future.  I would say that the wifi is good to have, but most of the apps are useless to us.  The one app that is worthwhile, along with the built-in wifi, is Netflix.  It is convenient to download a movie directly from your TV.The 3D feature is kind of cool but we haven't gotten a 3D movie yet to really test it out.  We've just watched some of the videos that LG provides on its own app channel.  (They have things like short videos in 3D of different locations around the world).  The good thing about LGs 3D vs. Samsung or Sony is that LGs glasses don't need batteries.  You can even use the glasses you get from the movie theater.  Also, LGs 3D is more depth than things popping out at you which is easier on the eyes.I'm not a big fan of the magic wand.  It activates (puts a cursor on the screen) every time you move it, even if you just want to put it in a different place on the coffee table.  It's also not very easy to move the cursor around the screen, and the \"mouse button\" isn't always responsive on the first click.  I would've rather had a directional remote.The other thing I'm critical about is the menu system.  I just don't think it's very explanatory with a lot of the settings.  I feel that my Samsung that I've had for 4 years is easier to navigate and make adjustments.  Now that I think of it, my Samsung has better sound quality too, but I was told that most of the larger TVs made now will lack in sound quality because they've taken the speakers off the sides and put them on the bottom.  I just connected it with an optical cable to my sound system and that takes care of the sound quality issue.In general, I'm happy with this TV, but I wanted to point out some of the downfalls in my opinion.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Already needs warranty repair work after only 3 weeks of use", "Author": "Dave Dedrickson", "ReviewID": "R21XSRKMV7Q56C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I first received this product and it was missing 2 of the 8 required screws in order to attach TV to stand.  I called customer support and the gentleman I talked to insisted it only took 6 screws instead of 8.  He fought me over this issue for 10 minutes before I finally took a picture of my owners manual to prove it to him.  He told me they would send 8 new screws in the mail and to date I still have not received them.  Bad start.  Once the TV was hooked up to HD, the picture was of excellent quality and the 3-d was great as well.  The TV worked fantastic for the short time that it actually worked.  This last Sunday night my son and I were watching a movie when all of a sudden the TV just shut off.  I thought I accidentally hit the remote power button or something.  Not the case.  The LED indicator light no longer worked but I hoped the TV still had some power.  Not to be.  Now when I attempt to turn the TV on, the LED indicator light just blinks red 3 times and then goes out all together.  Appears the mother board took a dive.  So I called customer service yet again and they asked me the usual stuff - is the power outlet working correctly, did you try a different outlet, did you unplug the set for 1 minute and try it again.  Of course I had tried all that stuff but to no avail.  Here's the kicker.  I live about an hour west of Denver - not exactly in the middle of nowhere, but LG does not support a service area where I live.  So I'm still waiting to hear back from them on when they can send out a repair technician.  Terrible customer service when I just spent $1200 on this product and heaven forbid I expected it to work.  Amazon customer service has been very good, but LG tech support and customer service certainly leaves something to be desired.  I'm seriously considering just returning the LG and going with Vizio or something else, but NOT LG.  Frustrated and pissed at the moment.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy So Far", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "RU6D7I0YP9Z39", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first major TV purchase. My old TV was a 32\" box set, so I wanted a \"true living room TV.\" I was torn between this or the Samsung as I think many researchers are. I ultimately went with LG. Mine is the 55\" have to say I'm definitely satisfied so far (about a month in).Look/Shape: Very thin frame and depth. Impressive. The stand mostly stays out of your view, which is ideal. Like others have said, it looks great just sitting there. Definitely a focal point of the room. The TV does swivel a bit, but not too much. At 55\" it really doesn't need to swivel that much to give good sight lines from a few seats. It does kind of \"feel\" like it might tip over, and I'm usually careful when I'm touching it. No problems so far, and I'm probably just being overcautious.Picture: Quality is great out of the box. I think a lot of the settings are personal preference. They have this thing that's kind of like being at the eye doctor where they say do you like picture a or picture b better, and then it makes settings for you. That was pretty cool. There are also some suggestions online, which I've tried. I watched a couple movies and the quality is so great it looks like you're standing 10 feet from the actors. There's a particular scene in a Pirates where J. Depp is in a canoe. It seriously felt like I was the director or something it was so clear. A nice touch is that the picture will automatically change to game if you're on a gaming input or cinema if you're on your DVD player.Sound: I'm not big into audio. It sounds alright to me, but I have found myself needing to crank it to hear anything at times. You'll probably need to buy something extra to achieve great sound.Remote: The wand works great. I think it actually controls a little better than the Wii remote. The cursor pops up whenever the remote moves. This is a problem at first, but I would recommend changing the pointer to the smallest setting, which will help hide it. You'll also get pretty good at balancing it so the problem becomes moot. I do find myself pressing the apps button when I meant to press mute a lot because they're kind of close together. Maybe I'm just clumsy.Start Menu/Apps: I think it's well designed. You can customize the bottom quick links bar, which makes it easy. Changing between inputs is very easy from the menu, though I do wish there was a button on the remote to switch back and forth between inputs. I'm hesitant to critique the individual apps too much, since I don't think that's necessarily a reflection of the TV. However, I will say the Netflix and MLB.com apps are fine so no hesitations there. The YouTube one is akin to a YouTube phone app. For some reason it won't let you watch all the content as you could on your computer. Pretty annoying. There are also a bunch of apps you won't use and I wish I could delete, but that's minor.Linking to computer/Smart Share: The program they make you use, Plex, is pretty poor. You have to load any files you want to use at your CPU first. I wish I could just remotely access my CPU from the TV directly. I've found the quickest way to move from CPU to TV is by using an external hard drive. Playback is fine from my 5 year old Western Digital with no lag to speak of.3D: The glasses are nice and easy to wear. I tried some of the stock 3D shows LG has and they look incredible. The only real problem is that there's just a limit of 3D content out there. I'm optimistic it will grow in the future, and I think this TV will be able to handle it. I've shown a few friends and they're always in awe of the 3D. I throw the 2D to 3D on random things and it has a varying effect. Some original Xbox games looked surprisingly awesome using the 2D-3D feature. The 2D-3D tends to make the picture look deep as opposed to jump out at you like normal 3D. The 2D-3D a little gimmicky and I wouldn't buy the TV just for it, but still neat.I got a notice recently that this TV had dropped like $200. Of course, right after I order it! IDK if they're coming out with a new model or something, but this TV is a steal at it's current price.

I have now had the TV for about 3 weeks and I really do like it. The 3D is excellent when shot as true HD (like IMAX movies), and I really like the few Xbox 3D games that are available. Picture looks good to me, it feels like I have seen better pictures in stores on other sets, but this is plenty for me.The \"Smart\" element of the TV is kind of limited, but I guess if you just want Netflix it seems fine. I have some difficulty streaming movies from my home computer (Plex media server keeps crashing...) but I think this is more about my network.I do still see the light areas in the corners of the set and the black is not very deep, that is really my only complaint. I did have a crash/reboot, but so far it only happened once.Overall I think it is good value, just wish I could justify the 65\" version.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:I have had this TV for a week now and to be honest its great. Hold on, why 2 stars? Well even though I love it, the 120Hz TruMotion feature heavily advertised is nowhere to be found on this TV. I did some digging and started finding all kinds of forum posts about this, notably on avsforum. So I contacted LG and this is what they had to say:James: Hi I just purchased the 55LM6200, and I was unable to find the settings for TruMotion.James: Do you know how to enable this feature?Naomi: helloNaomi: Good EveningNaomi: I will be more than happy to check that for you,.Naomi: the engineers are working on the software for it to be on the menuNaomi: I do not have a ETA but they are working on itJames: So there is no way to turn on the feature until that software is released?Naomi: No the engineers are working on itSo basically one of the key features of this TV is simply not available. Locked up in software until they release an update that has no ETA... That seems pretty dishonest. There are some interesting other factors here. Although I just purchased this TV mine was manufactured back in March, well I don't care about that, except that the TVs with newer manufacture dates indeed have the TruMotion feature enabled and available on the menu... They have an updated firmware that is not available for download from the LG site, that seem strange, why wouldn't they release that firmware for these older (I got mine a week ago and it is \"older\") units.I suppose if the firmware isn't released in the next week or so, I'll have to send this unit back to Amazon which is a royal pain.Other than that I do like the TV, the passive 3D is great, really impressed.There are a couple of other downsides. The corners are really lit up by the backlight, so when the picture is black, they are almost white.

It is an excellent buy for people who want a good TV with useful features and very little 'fluff' for general use. 'Videophiles' should perhaps consider a different model. 3D performance is good, even if the image is only 540 lines to each eye, not full HD. Personally, I was unable to spot any huge PQ differences between this and an Active 3D TV.While the picture quality is very good, the screen is glossy and prone to reflection. The Trumotion smoothing requires upgrade to the latest firmware, although for most casual viewing it wasn't really an issue whether it was turned on.A few caveats worth mentioning:This panel is not a true 120hz panel (if one cares for this sort of thing). It is a 60 hz panel with some supposed (suspect) processing that 'deserves' a 120Hz rating, according to LG.The HDMI ARC feature is a little mysterious - it requires setting up the audio to go to the external speaker and also REQUIRES that the simplink feature (found on the input list for that HDMI input) be enabled. This is not documented in the manual and one is left doing a variety of useless activities (changing HDMI cables, tweaking connectors, banging receivers, etc) to achieve the desired result.Netflix (and other apps) have very slow response times on average. Browsing for Netflix movies is best done on a computer.The internet browser is not very useful, one is better off using it as a monitor for a laptop/desktop.Couldn't figure out how to automatically change to 4:3 letterbox when 480p content is detected.These minor issues notwithstanding, this set is highly recommended for casual users.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stopped Working After 2 Weeks - LG Customer Service Couldn't Care Less", "Author": "bsolds", "ReviewID": "R2DJRF8O1J2GI9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Beware!

What a GREAT TV", "Author": "L Breul", "ReviewID": "RYDXCIUDHR0NI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had another brand that lasted less that 3 year (Toshiba) and tried contacting them for some help, but they literally have no Customer service so I decided on another TV.  I shopped around quite a bit and finally decided on the LG 3D HD Smart TV.  I couldn't be more satisfied.  First, the set up is easy and with the Magic remote, navigation is a snap.  The high definition is exceptional, and on a large TV, that says something.  The Smart TV function is just that, plug in the internet cable from your modem or router and you are online; and if you're not close enough to plug in, no worries, it has built in WiFi.  After setting up I decide to try the 3D.  I tuned to the LG 3D world app, pressed the button and had a load of 3D content available.  If you think there isn't enough content available, the 2D to 3D conversion works pretty well (not as good as if it wasn't converted, but it'll do just the same).  One of the things I like about the 3D LG offers is it's passive.  I know there are people who say it's not as good as Active, but if it's not, I can't tell the difference.  Another plus is that you don't have to buy expensive replacements if the ones that came with the set fail, any 3D glasses of the Movie theater variety will work and LG Cinema 3D will make you feel as though you are in a movie theater.Another option that helps to set this TV apart from the pack is the split screen/full screen capability that it has.  Any genuine split screen video game can be viewed as full screen by each player individually without the players having the ability to see each others screen.  My son LOVES it!Finally I have to say, the one thing you don't think you need but it has is apps.  I admit, it's bordering on corny to have apps on a TV (we all have smart phones and tablets at this point, don't we?) but they are surprisingly nice to have.  Again, my son loves the games as well as viewing videos using the YouTube app included with the TV.My next purchase is going to be a 3D BluRay DVD player (LG of course) so I can enjoy the TV to it's fullest.  If you're thinking of buying a TV, look no further and buy an LG, you WON'T be disappointed, I know I'm not.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV Great Price", "Author": "mike", "ReviewID": "R1ZL7SN1PYIR2K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Price, Size, Quality, Smart Features, Input options.Cons: Remote is goofy, changing inputs requires going into a menu, Speakers have crackling sound at high volumes really quickly (I didnt expect great sound quality from the speakers in it, I plan on getting a surround sound system)", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv,but---", "Author": "Clayton Holland", "ReviewID": "R1GO4DT48ORIN6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i would give it a 5 if it were not for the remote. it sucks?  the cursor will not stay on long enough unless you continue to shake it to death. i am trying to replace it with one with no magic attached.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Test Run", "Author": "IBK \"irfanbk\"", "ReviewID": "R3BTFCCTI3YH69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is what I've tested so far with the TV in a week that I had it.

I had 2 partitions on the drive, FAT32 and NTFS, both worked (PS3 supports only FAT32, so files greater than 4GB needed to be split or converted, not anymore.) JPG and MP3 were a breeze.  Sound from the TV was also good for built-in speakers.  Magic remote (mouse) is superb.  Youtube worked great (My PS3 is having problems with youtube for sometime now.)  Netflix - no problem at all.  The TV has a really fast processor to be supporting MKV/3D HD files and so the input switching are instantaneous.  Tried Dual Play glasses but they were not as good as I was hoping.

I did purchase others that would fit children better and found those for $10 on amazon for 2 pair.The only complaint I really have is that the screen is glossy and that does cause some reflections at certain times of day, but it really is not that bad and not enough for me to remove a star from the rating.

Those that aren't used to wii's or xbox kinect may have a hard time getting used to it at first, but believe me, it makes navigating the tv menus much easier.

Took an hour to assemble on the stand and set up (lots of cables). Had a problem with too much black in dark scenes obscuring most detail, fixed that. Then I checked the internet connection. It told me there was a software update I should apply. I did. Then the problems began - USB issues, bluetooth not connecting problems, messages that my wired connection was disconnected, then a message that it was connected, sometimes repeating for a few minutes at a time. So I called LG tech support (on Minday). A tech came to my house on Tuesday, saw the messages about the wired connection disconnecting, and told me that the software update has major problems, so bad that it affected all the boards in the system, and told me that LG would replace the TV with a new and properly updated one. It was, he said, cheaper to replace the whole TV than to replace all of the boards.Internet connection works OK, but the rendering is a bit slow. No Skype yet, they are still working on it, and the TV will only support an LG webcam. USB home movies play just fine, so does my Roku box.I should be able to connect my tablet, phone and laptop via bluetooth and wifi, but the software update apparently killed that according to the tech. I also want to be able to turn the bluetooth off (it seems to be on all the time by default).The picture quality is so good that anything I watch seems almost like a play, rather than a movie.

This television is set up in a basement playroom and is intended to be used primarily for streaming movies, playing PC games, playing Xbox games, and playing Wii games. I purcahsed the 55\" version. This is the second LG TV I have purchased from Amazon, so in general, I know and am satisfied with LG quality.Delivery - The delivery was a bit confused by emails from Amazon that it had to be rescheduled and emails from the frieght forwarder that it would arrive on time. I made a call to the freight forwarder and determined that Amazon was in error. The delivery van was only staffed by one person, so I had to give him a hand. This item is not heavy, but bulky. They did help me put it into the room for which it was intended and helped me remove the old television. Very pleased with the extra help.Out-of-the-Box - The Televison packaging was well thought out and was very \"Green\". The packaging was all recyclable (assuming that your local recyler accepts plastic bags and styrofoam - mine does) and marked with the appropriate codes. Everything was in place with nothing missing or damaged.Set-up - Like most flat-panels, the stand is not installed when you recieve it, so you will need a padded areas to install the stand. If you plan on wall mounting, they include the stand-offs. This is to be placed on a stand, so I had to install the stand. This was easy and all the parts went together (two pieces to the stand and eight screws) well. I was able to easily lift it to a height of three feet and position by myself. The set-up was easy and the connections adequate. HDMI is the primary connections anymore, so it was not a surprise that there were plenty of HDMI connections and only one composite connection. No cables are included other than the adapter cables for composite and standard video, so make sure you ahve th ecables you need on hand. Amazon sells a solid set of HDMI cables and I was already using these on the other television, so it was just a matter of plugging in the old cables to a new television. There is a guided set-up when you turn the TV on, and it assumes that you will have cable connected (which I do not). My only suggestion is that you set the clock to manual if you do not have cable directly installed. I had hoped that it would use network time, since I plugged this TV directly into ethernet and a router, but it does not.Picture - The picture is very good overall. The look of the PC, XBox, and WII were noteably better then the picture I had before. The only thing I did notice is that you can over-drive the edge lighting, casuing a \"Halo\" effect. Watch out for that!! I also noticed that I had to play with the Gamma to lighten up items in shadows. Although Black Blacks are good for cinema, my son complained that he could not see things in the dark. The colors are excellent, and the pre-sets offer you some variations for your taste.3D - This the second 3D TV of this type that I own. We also own an Active 3D television. Although the 3D picture is not as crisp as on the active, it is very good and I would argue that most users would never know the difference. The 3D conversion software is also very good on LGs. Look at my other review and I will tell you all of the pluses and minuses that I have seen. The last comment is 3D gaming. I did try a first person game in 3D conversion just to get a feel for what it does. It actually did a good job and even thought the game is not designed for 3D (Battlefield 3) the effect was a lot of fun and it did not change the playability, well, at least from what I can tell. I am really not very good at these games. LOL.Dual Play - You need special glasses for this. I have not tried this out, but will update this if I ever do. If it works, it is a great concept.Game Controllers - Since this will be used a lot for gaming, I think I should comment on putting the Wii bar and the XBox camera on top of the TV. I can not see any way to do it without the purcahse of the Xbox mount. I did buy the one licenced by Xbox and the 3D gaming controller now has a stable home. I also purchased the Wii adapter to put the controller on top of he Xbox camera. A lot of people on Amazon said that tape would work just as well, but I did not want to stick a bunch of tape on to the controllers. This also worked well asn gives the overall look a very nice, professional feel. I would reccomend spending the extra money for both of these items if that is your intended use.Software - The LG comes with a lot of web connectivity. It makes you wonder if turning off cable and going over the top is a better deal. Basically, much of what you could do with a Roku or Apple TV you can do with this. Set-up is painless and other than getting use to the remote for text entry, fast.Remote - The remote is different then you would expect. It has only basic functions on it (Back, Home, Volume, Mute, Channel, 3D, My Apps/Menu) and a wheel and arrow function. Basically, the remote tracks your movements and a mouse like cursor moves across your screen. This works fairly well, although not perfectly. Overall, I like the old style of remote better, but this is adequate. The only curious thing is htat hte box included a leash for the remote, but I will be darned if I can figure out where it goes. If someone else figures it out, let me know. Batteries are included, so once you put them into the base, you are ready for remoting.Wireless Picture - So, this TV also comes wihtthe ability to stream from a PC or tablet to the television. Using Windows, I was able to do this. I have not tried it with my iPad or Mac, but if I do, I will let you know. The picture was good and stable from a distance of 10 feet.Value - This is a lot of TV for ~$1300 (at the time of the review). the price will go lower as newer models come out, but as yuou start to look at features and size, this is a good value. You will also note a large jump between 55 and 65 inches.Warranty - I had a very bad experience with another TV and thankfully I had purchased the extened warranty. Although I genrally believe that warranties are not a good value, I do buy them on complex electronics. It may be a waste, but if you get the one in a million that has and issue...well, yoiu will be glad. I purchased the LG warranty. I have never used it on my other LG TV, hope never to have to, so I can't comment on service.Summary - I do reccomend this tv for someone who wants a solid TV with lots of features.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sound", "Author": "KITCHENMAN", "ReviewID": "RHIVZSRRBQZM5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the picture/resolution..... but I am VERY unhappy with the sound.

After setting up and starting the TV was a breeze.PRO:1) The Wii-like remote isn't as hard as others stated. I never used a Wii before but using the remote was real easy. So, don't let the remote discourage you from buying the TV. ( I actually enjoyed moving around the remote for actions, it was fun! )2) The setup was easy, and the WiFi connected to my wireless network without any issue.3) The sound is great. I have a large living room, and bringing the volume at 60 was loud. I did test it all the way to 100 and it was blasting. Although having a surround sound speaker wouldn't hurt.4) Light-weight. For a 55\", the TV was light and very thin. The packaging of course was huge but very protective! But I am only guessing they did it to protect the TV from any type of damage.CON:1) While playing netflix, it starts out a little blurry but the quality becomes like blu-ray in matter of minutes. Again, I use it as a CON, because I was a little nervous but shouldn't be a game changer.NEITHER:1) TV will run on 60Hz and 120Hz based on the input used for the connection.( Not tested yet ) I connected my XBOX and played a game as well as watched Netflix and they ran at 60Hz.Still thinking... Whether or not I should buy the LG 2-year extended warranty. They are running a promo but IDK if it's worth the money even at a price they are offering.

It goes away after 3-5 seconds of no motion but once you move it, it pops right back on screen again.

At the time, it was the new kid on the block and therefore cost $1,799.00.  We have thoroughly enjoyed the picture quality, apps, and ease of use since owning.  Unfortunately, on May 7, 2013, we turned the TV on to find what looks like a \"burned\" spot on the top of the screen.  The affected area is approximately 10\" wide and comes down 5\" from the top of the screen.  It is non-linear.  I called the 800-243-0000 number to report the problem.  It seems it connects to a call center in the Philippines(?) and the experience was awful.  The call center honestly sounds like it in the back room of a chicken fighting arena.  I could not hear the rep for the yelling in the background.  After several minutes, I asked her to turn around and tell everyone there to shut up so we could carry on a professional conversation between customer and seller.  It did no good.  The young lady who answered is not a TV guru.  She was only able to read from a script that took me through my TV settings.  I kept telling her this was a waste of time as I had already checked settings and this was definitely a defective area on the screen.  She hung up.  I then logged on to lg.com to fill out a repair request. The \"description\" block that relays the problem allows 1000 characters.  I completed and sent the request.  The next day, I recieved an email stating the description was \"cut off\" and could not be understood.  Note: My phone number was given to them in addition to my email address so why not call me to find out instead of sending an email which caused further delay?  I logged back on to lg.com and completed another repair request.  The same thing happened...no intelligable description.  I called the 800 number again and after 15 minutes (no exageration) of explaining that I was at work and not in front of the TV, I convinced the rep to stop trying to troubleshoot the problem from her script and to simply put in a repair request.  I was told there are no repair reps in my area but the request would be submitted.  It's been two business days and no contact from lg.  I don't even know if the answer will be, \"Sorry, there is no repair technicians in your area and as such we can not repair your TV.  Please read the fine print in regards to the warranty and repair.\"  This scenario is highly possible given the customer/technical support track record so far.Lg was happy to sell the product but the support behind said product is very dismal and you will feel like a second class citizen who has been taken advantage of if you decide to purchase this TV and anything goes wrong outside of the retail stores return deadline (usually 90 days).

It got great reviews on Amazon and on other websites. I've had 2 Vizio LED TVs, one 37\" with 60 Hz and one 42\" with 120 Hz, so these are what I used as a baseline for comparison. Sadly, even the 60 Hz Vizio outperformed the LG. The picture quality while watching HD channels was just okay, and there was noticeable motion blur during sporting events. I tried tweaking every possible setting myself and with an LG representative over the phone, and I even had my cable guy weigh in on the picture quality while he was here to drop off a box. He agreed that the picture quality was mediocre at best. Next, I went into a local electronics store just to see what the same model would look like in order to make sure I didn't get a defective set. The sales rep told me that it's a great TV with a great picture, but to be honest I was unimpressed. Maybe I'm spoiled by my Vizios, but I think for a TV that costs $1300 the picture quality should be stunning. Not the case here, and it was at this time when I started to wonder whether you have to get into the next tier of TVs, ie 240 Hz with CMR, to get that stunning picture quality. I ended up sending the TV back (or at least trying to, see below) and my plans are to check out the larger Vizios in person, and if I'm not satisfied to spend a little more, ie $2000.As for the shipping, I'm not sure if Amazon uses 2nd rate shipping companies like CEVA to save money, but I will never buy another product from Amazon unless an alternative shipper is available. The \"white glove\" delivery service is a joke; the 2 guys that delivered my TV were so inept it was scary. I had to take over before they broke something in my house or the merchandise, and we're not talking about anything complex here. The \"scheduled pickup\" that CEVA didn't show up for forced me to sit in my home for 6 hours waiting, and I even called the company and was assured that they would be there last night.

There was no safety or care for my product or consideration for me as a customer.  If you order through adorama they use a company called Manna and they are horrible with service.  But onto why I am here.  The TV !The television itself gets 5+ stars and two bug thumbs and toes up.  I had this unit from rent a center and was going to pay upwards of 3grand for it, but that's what you get when you use that company.  The price of $999 was a steal for this tv.It has everything I need,  its a smart tv which lets me surf the web, utilize Netflix, Hulu Plus and Vudu along with a list of other apps.  The picture is crisp and clear  the only complaint I have is the sound which is a little soft even when turned up, but there is nothing a sound bar wont cure.  So it still gets 5 stars.  I have watched many films that are not in 3d in 3d with this device and it does the job just right.  For instance I watched with my daughters The Princess and the Frog in 3D and Aladdin on Blu ray ( regionfree Uk copy)  in 3D and they look stunning.  They look just as if it would if you were to use a real 3D blu ray.  There are  many features to this television such as games, and other apps that you can go right through LG for.  Also the tv can be controlled with an ipad or tablet or even a cell phone if you download the app to make it a controller.  The tv comes with the magic remote which is a fun little gizmo and doesn't have a bunch of button which makes it easy to navigate in the dark.  This tv also can use a camera for video chatting and you can use a wireless mouse and keyboard to have your own 55 inch monitor .  This is a must have unless you want larger.  I recommend this tv to anyone looking.  The 2013 model looks nice but I prefer this.  A+ for the tv and a solid D for the seller even though they have agreed to refund $75 because I had to pick the tv up because their shippers wouldn't have arrived until the 2nd or 3rd week of march when I ordered this on Feb 12 2014.

Consumer reports rates this as a top pick (5 overall among all TV's in its size class) and when we received it we could see why. The colors really pop on this tv. The picture is just vibrant and crisp......until the motion sets in.There is noticeable blur on action scenes, which the Trumotion is supposed to remedy. The only problem with this is that Trumotion makes everything look like it was filmed with a backdrop. It's really hard to explain, but coming from a plasma all I can say is that everything looks really fake. I contacted LG customer service a couple time as I read that this isn't a true 120Hz tv, but instead a 60Hz display with Trumotion to make up the difference. Not sure if that is true since LG never responded to me. I also have noticed, during really dark scenes, a fuzziness in the black portions of the monitor. Now, I'm not an expert with tv jargon, but after having a plasma and doing some research I am led to believe this was an LCD issue as LCD's are not able to reach the deep blacks that plasmas do.On a positive note, the 3d is amazing. We bought Tangled and absolutely loved it. We didn't buy this tv for 3D, but it made it really hard for us to return it once we saw what it could do in 3D. We did, though, want a tv with amazing 2D picture and since that is 99% of our veiwing experience we decided to return this set and get the Panasonic VIERA TC-P55VT50 55-Inch 1080p Full HD 3D Plasma TV. It is supposed to be one of the best plasma's ever made. I know we won't get the same with 3D ( we looked at the GT50 in Paul's TV and the 3D was painful to watch) and we will need to pay $50 for each pair of glasses (the LG came with six free pairs of lighter, superior passive glassses), but that's ok. We just cannot stand that fake look.If you are ok with some motion blur and are use to the fake look Trumotion gives you then this is a beautiful tv. My wife and I were actually torn in returning it because there are things about it we really do love, but in the end we went with our main reason for choosing a tv - a beautiful 2D veiwing experience. The 2D isn't bad by any means and for the price it is an excellent deal, but the 2D isn't great and when you spend this kind of money and watch a good amount of tv then, well, ya know.....", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "TV IS NOT 120hz REFRESH RATE!", "Author": "Average user", "ReviewID": "R1DK3A0U5K7P9L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It is a decent set, but like many others, I fell for LG's marketing ploy.

However, the picture looks AWFUL during some (not all) commercials. I understand that some commercials are not shot in HD (even on HD channels), but my old Vizio LCD (3 years old, 1080P 120hz) never had this problem. When watching an Apple commercial for the new iPad, the images of the iPad screen were so grainy and pixelated that I could not even read the text... this is worse than a hotel TV. I have tried all calibration settings and cannot overcome this.. it was evident when watching HD sports, too. Is this a problem with the individual unit, or the TV model line as a whole? Any advice would be welcome as I love the looks/pricepoint of this television and the 3D was awesome.
