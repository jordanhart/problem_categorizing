So Far...", "Author": "BlueMango", "ReviewID": "R2UTS96KX12KCK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased the Vizio VX200E 20\" HDTV last night at Sam's Club for $170. I had been considering a Samsung LN19B360 19\" HDTV to replace our older non-HD Samsung 19\" LCD on the kitchen counter. The Vizio VX200E caught my eye with a great picture, larger yet still compact size plus a lower price compared to the Samsung... so off I went with the Vizio. I'm connected directly to the cable... no cable box, no outside antenna. When given the \"Turn On\" command, the set does take a few seconds to \"warm up\" before switching on, but that's not a show-stopper. After going through the setup procedure, we were pleased to be watching a top-notch picture considering the price. Broadcast channels in HD over the cable look great on this set. Sound quality is satisfactory though a little hot on treble... haven't tried to adjust sound or the picture/ color... default settings are quite good.I wonder if TV remote design engineers use the products they design?? Seems that none of the TV remotes are flat on the bottom so one can push remote buttons with the unit sitting on the table/ counter without ending up with the remote flipping over.Overall I am very pleased with this product... after less than 24 hrs of use... it's performance over time will determine my long-term view of quality & reliability.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "disappointing", "Author": "spin_nin", "ReviewID": "R3MIGE1I0PXTO0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This set was for use in a kitchen. Based on the low price, lots of available connectivity, decent sound quality, and it is a good size for the application we went with the Vizio.The TV falls short in the most important area which is picture quality.It is not sharp, it is very pixelated at all times, and suffers from major motion blur. Images just don't look right on this set. Colors were vivid though.Used an OTA HD signal from a roof top antenna that doesn't display like this on other sets.I suggest spending a few bucks more and go with a Samsung or LG in this size range. Their picture quality is excellent.", "Date": "October 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice TV for the price!!!", "Author": "Clem J.

I like the fact that it was 20 inches not 19, and I liked the Vizio over similar offerings from Samsung, Dynex, Sylvania, and Insignia. I purchased it for use in my home office, would have prefered a black housing instead of white, but that was not a concern.  I got it set up and hooked it to my Dish Network DVR via coax cable and the non hd channels look good when setting the tv to the Zoom 1 setting, and watching the Winter Olympics on the local NBC HD channel looks fine, I went on the internet and looked and the recommended viewing distance for a 20\" to 5 feet so it looks a little fuzzy closer up as compared to it being in VGA mode for the computer, the other knock on this Tv from what I read was that it has only a 160 degree viewing radius, but since I am will primarilty the only one watching it, was also not a concern. The tricky part was hooking it to my notebook computer, which was the part of the reason for buying it. I used a VGA cable as oppose to HDMI, the native resolution is 1600x900 and windows 7 set it up correctly, but on the TV the computer image was pushed way right, and up. I called tech support and the women was of no use in assisting me in correcting the problem. I moved internet explorer over to the tv screen and after maximizing the window, I then using the TV settings, played with the horizontal alignment, size, and vertical alignment and got it adjusted correctly and it looks just fine.  The remote is quite large, but its no bigger than my DVR one so I don't mind. My initial opinion is that its a great tv for the money, so only time will tell on the the durability.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "20\" diagonal *ATSC/NTSC/Clear QAM tuner * Supports 480i (SDTV), 480P (EDTV), 720P (HDTV), 1080i (HDTV), 1080P (FHDTV)\nNative Panel Resolution: 1600 x 900 * Pixel/Dot Pitch:  0.2768 (H) x 0.2768 (V) mm\nSignal Compatibility:  Supports 480i (SDTV), 480P (EDTV), 720P (HDTV), 1080i (HDTV), 1080P (FHDTV)\nDisplay Compatibility:  HDTV (720p) * Response Time: 5ms\nBrightness 300 nits", "Name": "VIZIO VX200E 20-Inch ECO 720p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513uU857M4L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002GP9JR2"}}
