Since it came with only a regular remote and every time you want to type something like say your 10letter password you have use the up/down/right/left and select key for each of the letter. As well as trying to move the mouse pointer with the remote is so ridiculous  the amount of time you have to press for it to move barely.  Along with this there wasn't any postcard for a better remote like other people have mention, since we bought two and either of them have it.The good new is that it is compatible with some wireless mouse and keyboard.  The bad part is that none of its documentation list what it is compatible with, and nothing can be found on its website.They offer a App for apple and android, BUT right now the apple version doesn't really work (so many people are having issue of it keep saying \"Disconnected...Network Connection Failure\" they haven't update it since fall of 2011.  As for the Android version of it is actually working but trying to move the cursor on a web page is a real pain and effort to even move it a little as well as a full keyboard is not accessible anywhere.  It is supposedly pop up when you need to type but haven't had work yet.Overall the picture quality and sound of this for the price is awesome.  Not to mention some of their app like Netflix, Allshare and other that you could download.  The setup of it to the internet through lan or wifi was really really easy.The Main downfall of this device is that for a smart tv, it just really suck that you can't make full use of it due to the lacking of a proper input tool (like a keyboard or a better remote with a full keyboard)", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Picture is great, software and network sucks", "Author": "K. Williams", "ReviewID": "RTNM9NH2CZ86K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture is awesome. The TV is nice and thin. The Samsung Smart Hub software pretty much sucks. It's slow. Buggy. Loses the DLNA connection frequently. Even when it is still connected, it pretends it's not connected -- it will tell you there is no device connected, but if you pull up the previously viewed items on the network you can browse and watch those. Just can't browse the network. Doesn't play all video filetypes, even though it recognizes them. When you try to play one, it will disconnect itself from the DLNA connection. I'm thoroughly annoyed with all these devices that they build extra features on and then don't clearly put any bug testing into them. Way to go Samsung. Next up on the pet peeve list is the Smart Hub is filled with spam. Yes, permanent spam that you can't remove. Don't subscribe to Netflix? Too bad, their icon is always front and center and among the biggest. Don't subscribe to Hulu, Pandora, etc. etc.? Same thing...It's like having a PC where the desktop comes with all those bloatware shortcuts, except in this case the \"PC\" (the TV) won't let you delete them. You just get to have your menu cluttered up with crap you'll never use. That's the absolute -worst- kind of design and UI interface philosophy ever. Now, I'm pretty down on this aspect of the TV because I'm really annoyed by half-baked software that isn't designed at all with a user perspective in mind. I'm sure if you subscribe to all these services, you're fine with it. But it's pretty poor that you can't even move or delete the icons out of the way if you don't want them. There are a few nice features in the Smart Hub, but overall even when you stream videos it seems pretty laggy. Getting a dedicated piece of equipment (roku) to handle the network/streaming is the way to go.Ok, after bashing the TV software, I'm going to praise the picture. Very crisp and smooth movements. The TV is very thin and pretty light weight. The power cord placement in the back proved to be a pretty big pain since it's a thin TV. I did cut a hole in my wall and install a cable gang box, but the right angle on the cord wouldn't fit. So word to the wise... if you are cutting holes in the wall and installing gang boxes, for the TV, make sure you get a double gang box so it will be wide enough. A single gang box will bind the cord up on the wall and stick the TV far off the wall (if you're using the Samsung slim mount).If you don't care about the TV software get this. If you're buying this so you can have the great picture and the software don't get this unless you plan on buying a Roku box as well (it's what I did). Annoying that I'm paying extra for the software/network features and not using them because they pretty much suck.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung light years ahead of the competion!", "Author": "D. Neal", "ReviewID": "RUFU9M4D3D2PG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just brought this tv yesterday after 4+ hours in Bestbuy comparing it agaisnt LG's, Sony's and Panasonics. I found that the picture clarity surpassed tv's that costed hundreds of dollars more. But when I got it home is when this baby began to really shine! Set up was easy and once the tv updated it was ready to go. I logged on to Youtube and watched a few videos as though I owned the DVD of them! I knew if this thing looked that good watching Youtube videos I was going to be in for a pleasant surprise when I hooked up my Xbox and began gaming! Well let me tell you....I SAW THINGS IN GAMES I OWNED FOR A YEAR THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE! The picture was sharp with deep vivid colors like I never saw before. I played my Xbox for about 30 mins and couldnt take it any longer. I had to see what Blu-ray would look like! So I went downstairs to my basement (man cave) and took my Blu-ray player from my 61 inch Samsung 1080p DLP tv. Well let me tell you, I put on Clash of the Titans and I almost had an orgasam!!!!!!!!! The damn movie was so clear it looked like a LIVE PLAY! The parts where water was involved I had to check my screen to make sure it wasnt wet....thats how life like it looked!Bottom line is if you want a tv that looks awesome yet doubles as a computer then this is what you are looking for!", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "M. Elterman", "ReviewID": "R1IBXAWR6FHMG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: This is the review for the 40\" model.This is a great tv. Superb picture quality, great blacks and color after calibrating. Supports a bunch of important settings including xvyCC (full color range mode), and 1:1 Pixel Resolution (called \"Screen Fit\" in the settings.Unlike some other reviews complaining about spacing between the mount holes and power connector, I had no problems mounting the TV on my wall with my Sanus wall mount.I do not use the Smart TV features as I already have an Xbox 360 for all that, so I cannot comment on those much. I tested netflix as well as playing movies from my PC, both worked perfectly.The sound coming from the TV is just ok, not as good as fat LCD TVs for obvious reasons. However the sound is not bad at all and for most people it is fine. You can adjust sound settings including equalizer if you wish.A note on input lag: I measure the input lag on this TV to ~30ms with Game Mode enabled. A very good result for an LED TV. With input lag at 30ms game play feels very responsive and fluid.All in all this TV is well worth the money. This TV uses the exact same panel (the screen itself) as the ES6500 and even the ES8000 series - the TS01 panel. The differences lie in the software and video processor hardware between these series. This means that while you do not have access to the features available in the more expensive models, the picture quality should be very similar across the board.

Avoid Allshare.", "Author": "TGav", "ReviewID": "R2A0H8JGGFTST1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review is from the perspective as an entertainment center for streaming standard and HD content.Bought the 40\" model for an upstairs bedroom. As a basic TV this set is superb. Perhaps not the top of what's out there, but for a secondary TV it does its job elegantly.Used for:  cable TV, streaming audio, streaming video on-line and from media server. No other input device/player used.First, the wi-fi on this set is built in. I have another Samsung 32\" older model that needed the separate proprietary USB wifi adaptor which fit in perpendicular to the back making a tight on wall mount impossible without an extender.I stream from a downstairs room ( Apple AirPort router). Signal remains strong without dropouts streaming smoothly 720p AND most 1080p content - it can't do 16:9 1080p wireless stream, same as with all devices, but it does 2.35:1.I advise against using Allshare as a media server due to many limitations although it is free. For me, the deal breaker was that it doesn't accept content from a CD or DVD to place in its library, so archived photos or videos will not be available to stream. After trying many free and demo alternatives, the one that runs perfectly is Mezzmo ($30), very highly recommended.That Samsung has decided to include Amazon Prime Video is welcome. The older generation of their TVs do not.Needless to say, streaming on line content (Hulu, Pandora etc) is flawless.Next, this set is able to handle most standard CODECS out there including flac and vorbis! I cannot overemphasize the advantage of this versatility if you want the TV to function as a multimedia center. Sure it has limitations, such as the lack of .wav support and won't allow flac audio from an .mkv container. However, it's the only TV brand I found that does DTS(!!!!) audio from . mkv which is a big plus.SUBTITLE handling in mkv containers has improved greatly over previous models. It automatically decodes .srt, .ass, and vobsub formats. Before, one needed to extract the subtitles from mvk in order for the TV to see them. Worse, it only read .srt so any other format needed to be converted. This is a huge advantage for people like myself who are unable to obtain esoteric and US unavailable anime except in mkv.The bottom mounted built in speakers do a good job. Option for digital audio out is a plus, but haven't tested that yet. The available apps are mostly junk except for a few. Your taste may vary.I really wish it could zoom on HD signals like my Oppo BR player. As such, 2.35:1 aspect cannot be zoomed to 16:9 without that annoying stretch artifact.In conclusion, this TV is versatile enough with fantastic picture and sound qualities, loaded with codecs, excellent wifi connectivity to make it a perfect multimedia center for the serious geek without the need to buy some external box. I cannot think of a better set at this price level to include all these technical features without the need for some separate device.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN40ES6100 Has Quality Control Problem", "Author": "Zhizheng Chen", "ReviewID": "R1ZO5GIQO7DW23", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "1.  I like its design. The picture quality is good. Internet connection is easy. Another reason I bought this model is its size fits my place perfectly. However, after one week of enjoyment watching my new TV, a group of quite serious Bright/Dark strips start to flash around the left upper part of the screen. Then everytime after the TV warmed up (about 15-20 minutes of playing) the Bright/Dark strips showed up. I asked amazon for an exchange. I got the second brand new set very quickly. This time, the new set immediately showed a one-inch wide, not-so-obvious brighter (or lighter) vertical edge on the very right of the screen. It will not bother the whole picture but it makes me very uncomfortable. I do not want to make more exchange and decide to keep this one. As a customer, if you go to a store to see the TV demo models and you find one that showes a brighter border (inconsistent with the whole screen), are you willing to buy?2.  Samsung Service. After I found the 'flashing strips', I immediately called Samsung Customer Service (SCS). After I described the syndrom, SCS asked me to contact a service center in Denver (about 1 - 1.5 hour driving). After I contact with the Service Center (SC), they asked me to wait for their call in 24 hours and make an appointment (in order for me to drive to the SC to deliver the set for their service). However, they never called.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV w/ Options", "Author": "FrustratedCatOwner", "ReviewID": "R2ORJJQJ5OEZ5J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This television offers a great combination of features and quality, but there are a couple of things that most certainly could be better.- Picture Quality: 5 stars. Feed a high quality signal to the set and the picture is bright, crisp, colorful, and smooth.- Sound Quality: 3 stars. The super slim design requires that the speakers be exceptionally small and positioned so that they don't fire forward. This detracts from the sound quality and makes it \"just ok\" for use in larger rooms (mine is in a large kitchen). The sound reflects heavily off of the wall behind the set, so wall mounting is the best, and I would not recommend using a full-motion mount (use a fixed or tilt mount only to keep the reflective qualities for the sound consistent).- Network connectivity: 4 stars. The wireless setup works well, but the wired connection is definitely better. Either way gets you connected in a reasonable amount of time, but entering WEP keys using the on-screen keyboard is cumbersome.- Available Applications: 2 stars. There are a few applications that many would find very useful, but the list is quite short. I appreciate having items like Pandora, but why not iHeartRadio too? It's also very misleading that you are able to access applications that say \"free\", but they are paid services. Hulu Plus is a perfect example - the app is free, but the service costs money.- DLNA / UPnP Support: 1 star. This is the absolute biggest disappointment for me in this set. They specifically call out DLNA support, but fail to tell you that you MUST use *THEIR* software on a PC. I have a very large media server setup using a standard UPnP software package, but I can not access ANY of that content with this television. This means that all of my family photos and videos can not be played back on this set. DLNA is an industry standard. If a company supports the standard, there is no requirement to use specific software (thus, the definition of a standard). I will be looking for ways to circumvent this.All things considered, it's a very good set. The primary use is watching broadcast shows, so that gets the most \"weight\" of the different ratings I used.

There are also a looooot of additional settings (especially in the Advanced Settings) that allow changes to be made to many different attributes that affect the picture color and quality. Most of which are available only if the Picture Mode is set to one of the other choices besides \"Dynamic\" or \"Natural.\"Unless you want to spend hours tweaking all those settings, I suggest changing Picture Mode to \"Dynamic\" or \"Natural\" even though that will cause the Advanced Settings to be unavailable, because it will also make fine tuning a lot simpler. One reason for this is that changes to many of the advanced settings are inter-related; changing one causes changes to other aspects of picture quality.  This can turn the process of dialing in the correct image quality using the advanced settings into a time consuming struggle. You can still to get excellent image quality with Picture Mode set to \"Dynamic\" or \"Natural.\"The \"Dynamic\" Picture Mode appears to have artificial dynamic contrast expansion on the quarter-tone to three quarter-tone range (the middle part of the contrast range, e.g.: maybe the 30%-to-70% range is expanded out to maybe 20%-to-80%), at the expense of shadow and highlight detail (e.g.: the 0%-to-30% brightness range is compressed to 0%-to-20% and the 70%-to-100% brightness range is compressed to 80%-to-100%), to make the image have a more \"punchy\" look. This dynamic aspect of this range expansion is that it appears to vary somewhat depending on the image on screen at any given time. Sometimes this causes very slight, but noticeable shifts in the image brightness. In comparison, the \"Natural\" Picture Mode doesn't appear to have this contrast adjustment, so compared to \"Dynamic\" it looks more natural, less punchy, with slightly better highlight detail and noticeably better shadow detail.In all four \"Picture Modes\" the default Picture options: \"Color Tone\" setting is \"Cool\" and I am pretty sure that is wrong for just about every situation.  Color Tone: \"Cool\" makes whites a little too blue and also introduces a greenish/bluish color cast to highlight & shadow areas that should be close to neutral (e.g.: causes a greenish color cast in men's beard stubble). Color Tone: \"Cool\" also causes grass (e.g.: football field) to be even more unrealistically bright glowing green than it should be. It should be changed to \"Standard.\" The other two choices (Warm 1 and Warm 2) are not available with Picture Mode set to \"Dynamic\" and are probably undesirable anyway, because Warm 1 and Warm 2 introduce a noticeable color cast into what should be neutral highlights (unless compensated for in white balance; an example of how changing one advanced setting affects something else).- - - - - - - - - -So the easiest way to make the Samsung UN40ES6100 look a lot better and more realistic is use either of the following settings as a starting point:Picture Mode: DynamicBacklight: 15 or less (Reduces backlight bleed-thru \"clouds.\" Lower backlight setting may require slightly higher brightness)Contrast: 70 to 80 (default is 100. Helps compensate for \"Dynamic\" Picture Mode's artificially expanded mid-tone contrast)Brightness: 35 to 40Sharpness: 35 to 45  (default is 55. Depends on personal preference; sharper picture = more noticeable sharpening artifacts)Color: 35 to 45 (closer to 35 is more natural, but some people like over-saturated colors)Tint: should be within 2 of the default 50-50 setting; e.g.: 48-52 or 52-48Picture options-> Color Tone: StandardPicture Mode: NaturalBacklight: 15 or lessContrast: 95 to 100 (definitely requires a higher setting than the \"Dynamic\" Picture Mode)Brightness: 45Sharpness: 35 to 45Color: 40 to 45Tint: should be within 2 of the default 50-50 setting; e.g.: 48-52 or 52-48Picture options-> Color Tone: StandardIn summary, either of these two setups should give a pretty good result:Set Picture Mode to Dynamic; significantly reduce backlight, contrast, brightness, sharpness & color saturation; set Color Tone to StandardorSet Picture Mode to Natural; significantly reduce backlight, brightness, sharpness & color saturation; set Color Tone to StandardAlso, the \"ECO\" settings (System->\"Eco Solution\") should be turned off, because they cause the screen routinely change brightness when it should not, with the net result being that it looks like flickering.- - - - - - - - - -These settings should get you pretty close to having an excellent - but realistic looking - picture quality, especially for Over The Air HDTV signals. I had to use slightly different settings for the HDMI signal coming from my HTPC DVR (which itself has an even more extensive set of image adjustments available in the video card software). When you throw in the adjustments that are possible on each other device that sends a signal to the TV set (which itself has independent settings for each input and signal type), it's easy to see why the overall complexity increases very quickly.If possible, I'd start with the most consistent possible source - an OTA HDTV signal, and I'd use the live local HDTV news broadcast as the guide, because they seem to have the best control over lighting in their studios and the signal is live.It is also important to note that these video quality settings are tied EACH video input and/or signal type.  This means that not only will settings made for HDMI1  *NOT* automatically apply to any the other input (i.e.: you have to repeat the adjustment process for EACH and every input), but also if you are using the antenna connection, the settings can be different for each different signal type as well (HDTV, SDTV, analog, etc.), and this also applies to aspect ratio control - which is a good thing, because it allows different picture quality and aspect ratio settings for each different signal type coming in via the same antenna connection. The settings for SmartHub/Netflix/HuluPlus, etc. are also different too, so you need to check the values for each app you use.- - - - - - - - - -After setting up the new Samsung 6100 TV set, I had to re-configure my home theater audio system. Normally, I would have used an external powered woofer/subwoofer, and let the TV's internal speakers take care of the mid-range and treble, but there's a problem in this case:The Samsung 6100 external audio output is fixed volume, which means the internal volume control does not affect the volume of the external audio output.Not only that, none of the other audio adjustments (including the 6100's equalizer, sound effects, and \"Automatic Volume\" volume leveler) are applied to the external audio output either. Since the internal speakers are wimpy, and even worse, down-firing (which makes them muffled), I had to disable them entirely and use only an external speaker system.I can't believe that Samsung did not provide a setting to make the external audio output variable with the TV's volume setting, especially considering that would be a fairly standard way for some people who don't have elaborate sound systems to improve upon the dinky internal speakers, and also considering that competing products like the Vizio M420SL provide a setting to make the external audio volume change with the TV's volume setting.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "M.

So, I plugged in a cheap USB mouse and it was MUCH more tolerable but still takes time to learn (took a long time to find the / (forward slash). I see I can buy a bluetooth keyboard or mouse so I would be \"wireless\" which I may do.  I see many complained that a wireless keyboard won't work and I wonder if that is because they didn't get the bluetooth keyboard/mouse?  I should clarify that mouse works in most apps....some don't allow.Also, it has taken several attempts to connect to wireless modem (unlike all our family smart phones and laptops)- maybe the modem I have doesn't support Samsung????? I do have high speed internet and You tube played reasonably well.So, it appears to return the TV to amazon will only cost $6.00 but we will keep because this is our 'upstairs/kitchen TV' and we don't watch a lot of Movies there plus my husband hopes Samsung will add / improve all their apps in the future.  Certanily we have learned a lot about smart Tv's from the experience.Positive:  I can buy movies from vudu and other apps for 3.99 (non HD). The HD move are 4.99 which I could just purchase from Direct TV for same price.  I may get subscription from Netflix over winter as it would be handy vs. plugging in laptop.You Tube works great but need mouse or keyboard to do search videos timely.My existing wall mount works if I buy a adaptor and metric screws...........M6 15 mm deepI would rate this \"smart tv\" as a 1 star because samsung has a long way to go before it is as smart as our laptops/phones.....but the same TV without \"smart\" is five stars because picture is WONDERFUL = average of 2.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Network error loop", "Author": "Lyssa", "ReviewID": "R3UIX522XKGTHJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV worked well for about a month and then it no longer recognized the internet network connection.

To be honest, it was hard to tell the difference when you're comparing both on display at a big box outlet, but it was on sale so it was only $50 more than the UN40EH6000. Granted I've only had it for a few days but I find the picture to be very impressive and vibrant, and I *still* have to calibrate the settings to get optimal results!Based on the reviews, I didn't expect to use the Smart Hub features that much, but I tried a couple of them. The wireless connection went smooth and worked like a charm. Several updates came up for both the Smart hub and firmware. That took a couple of minutes but nothing particularly onerous. I watched a number of YouTube videos just fine, although I noticed the selection returned isn't the same as what I'd see on my PC. Most of the bundled apps don't look terribly appealing, although Netflix support will be nice. Haven't tried web browsing yet as all I have is the bundled remote and I'm not a masochist. I've read that the Logitech K400 wireless keyboard/mouse combo works fine with this TV, so might give that a go.Really, my biggest gripe so far is the so-called DLNA feature that lets the TV show content from your computer network functionality. I had an older Samsung BluRay player that could just connect to my network and access media from my NAS box. It was clunky (sometimes forget passwords & other settings, etc) but could work in a pinch. Not so with the TV. You can get it to work, but you do need to download the Samsung AllShare application, which sits and runs in the background on your Windows PC. You're out of luck if you've got a Mac. Now, I have thousands of photos and several videos, etc. The program took a good day scanning my PC's shared folders and adding content to its library. Why, why, why is this even necessary? Come on Samsung, it's 2013! One of the reasons I have a NAS box is so that my PC doesn't need to be on just to access media. DLNA devices should just work, but for whatever reason Samsung makes you run some app on your PC...That being said, it's been able to play back all the videos I had on my PC, except for videos from my old Firewire-based camcorder and premium content from iTunes. Interestingly, video playback was smooth for non-HD files, but playing back an HD video from my PC resulted in the occasional pause while it was buffering. I was trying this all with a wireless connection and I still have to see if a wired connection would give better results here.Ultimately, I bought the TV for what seemed to me the best picture quality for the price. I read about plasmas but it was hard to find a decently spec'd one in the 40\" range that I was looking for, and the TV is in a room that gets quite a bit of ambient light. The Samsung UN40EH6000 was also very tempting; I would've just connected it to a WD HD TV Live Player or perhaps an Apple TV if I was going that route. But there were more differences than just the Smart functionality as others have already noted here.

The image resolution is beautiful! And, despite the mess that my cable tech made when switching my service from one company to another, I was connected to my cable service AND my home wireless network in under 15 minutes. I would place myself at maybe 6 or 7 on the techie scale of 1-10, yet set up was a snap.I mainly purchased this to watch Netflix movies without having to connect a separate computer. The Netflix app works beautifully! I was able to sign into my account and watch a movie within a matter of minutes. The You Tube app also works great. And the Fitness app is a bonus for both fitness buffs and beginners alike. Although the TV was not purchased for that reason, I consider the fitness app a lovely surprise extra!Right now, the TV is on a stand. I plan to do a wall mount later.

It makes browsing the App databases (like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu) basically impossible. So for a TV it works great. For the \"Smart\" stuff I am going stick with my PS3. I returned this TV in favor of a much cheaper, \"dumb\" Vizio. I probably wouldn't recommend this or any other \"smart\" TV to anyone with any other \"smart\" devices such as PS3, XBox, roku, TiVo or whatever.

(see update below - we did go wireless a couple of days after I wrote this.)We bought this tv a couple of days ago and set it up just to watch basic tv and thought then that we needed a wireless router so we could see just how smart this tv was & get on the internet. We drug out the old Linksys wireless-G 2.5 GHz router out of storage and a friend told me I needed the newer wireless-N router so we didn't hook the old router up figuring that we had to go buy a newer one. My husband had picked out this TV and after we brought it home I read many of the reviews and comments here and became discouraged thinking that this TV was going to be totally dumb, not do what it advertises to do and that we would have to return it and get something else. We were totally 1/2 way expecting to have to return it.We downloaded the e-manual from the Samsung site since we couldn't at first figure out how to read the e-manual on the tv. It took us a while to figure out the on-screen keyboard which was VERY cumbersome pointing and clicking with the remote control. Since we didn't have a newer wireless router we decided to hook up an ethernet cord to our modem to see what would happen. Wah Lah! we clicked on the internet icon and in three seconds were on the msnbc homepage. I guess it's the default but we changed the homepage to our liking. Then we decided Hey let's hookup a keyboard & mouse and see what happens. We were very surprised - it's just like a computer plug & play - the tv detected new hardware. I have a mac pro and husband has PC - this is easier than a PC!Our set up is that we have 2 home computers/ 2 other tv's & now this TV connected. We have Comcast cable. The internet function is working just absolutely great for us. We've been playing for at least 5 hours this evening with the TV and it's past our bedtime we can't stop.  We signed up for the trial Netflix and expected to have problems but NO problem, no skipping, nothing -we sampled movies, tv shows, etc. Everything is streaming fine, internet pops right up as does email and all our favorite sites. Youtube, Live U-Stream and plugging in the keyboard makes it SO much easier to get around. It's JUST LIKE having another computer - browser and all.We were expecting to have one of our kids come over this weekend and show us how to work everything (like I used to have to do when MY parents had a VCR lol) but when they come over this weekend WE will be showing them how this smart tv works! Did I mention we are in our 60's? Now they won't be standing over my shoulder telling me to click on this, click on that Mom, I want to show you this or that MoM. I'll just tell them to use the TV and click it on themselves!We will probably try the wireless later and see if it then becomes \"dumb\". We don't mind the ethernet, keyboard or mouse cords for now. So far, we're really happy with this smart tv!PS - I almost forgot to mention that we followed Brice S.'s calibrations which for us perfectly tuned the picture color, sharpness, etc. We love the picture quality and today took our old 50 lb. clunker TV and dropped it off at a Seattle Goodwill. No more heavy TV to move yay.UPDATE 12/6/12: We went to Comcast and got a newer modem with wireless built-in. Configured our devices including new wireless mouse & keyboard.

I discovered the screw size had been changed! That information was also not listed anywhere, nor could anyone at Samsung tell me what the screw size was!They were NOT included with the TV... I think this is ridiculous! They should include at least two lengths.The screws needed are M8 at least 15mm in length... M6 we're what my old Samsung TV used, so I had to make the holes in my mount bigger.After that was done it mounted up fine.The TV picture took a little time to get the settings right. I went between live TV, Blu-Ray discs, concerts and movies (I have Verizon FIOS digital HD) to find the best balance in the settings. I settled on the MOVIE picture setting as I thought it looked the best to me.One plus is that it saves the picture settings for each HDMI input. However, it DOES NOT save the sound settings for each input. I think the latter would be useful.The picture and sound are decent for the $$$ but if you have the space (and the money) I would go for the higher end Samsung LED's.Using the remote on my iPhone is neat but not super practical as it needs to connect to the TV via Wifi everytime.

Thin, lightweight, elegant case with slim bezel. Average to above average remote control.The sound is OK. Wifi works and is pretty easy to setup. It doesn't make any sounds when you turn it on or off.ConsSmart TV feature works, but is slow and clumsy, sometimes annoying. I'd give it 5 stars were it not for this shortcoming.The manual states that the wall mount requires a 200mm x 200mm VESA pattern with M6 screws, but my unit required M8 screws. Of course, they did not come with either the TV or the mount.I read some of the earlier reviews where the TV has developed problems after an hour or even a week.Most of the reviews were positive however, so I decided to give it a shot. The price was right. I've had mine for about a month now and I can happily say that I've had no problems with wierd or changing colors, network problems, or login issues.So what are my complaints? Short answer - it can be downright annoying.Samsung missed the mark where so many other companies miss the mark these days, in the software.The Smart Hub on my TV works just okay. Getting around is a little slow, but it works. I wouldn't call it a total failure like I read someone else say. Maybe my unit is newer. That doesn't mean it's not annoying.I got this TV for the bedroom. I like to watch movies streamed from Netflix, and catch the local news and weather once in a while. As a result, I haven't had a need to connect this TV to a cable box. I just watch whatever channels the cable company sends in the clear (all the locals, plus a few cable-only channels). If you plan to use a cable box and ignore the built-in tuner, you'll save yourself one of the headaches that I went through. Programming favorite channels is not at all intuitive, and waaay more complex than it needs to be.I had to access the built-in manual to figure out how to do it. (The built-in manual is one of those things that you're glad you found, but know you really shouldn't need in the first place.)The channel programming is divided into two separate functions. Initial channel scanning is under the setup menu (pretty straightforward), and programming favorites is under the Smart Hub menu. I suppose the logic is that the lines between TV and internet are getting blurred, so it makes sense to put channel programming with internet functions. Right.  You can't rename channels. You can reorder them, but it's rediculously painful to do. This part isn't very smart. Oh, and if the so-called \"Smart Hub\" was really smart, it would remember your last selection, and not default to \"Family Story\" every time you enter. Quite painful if you use the Smart Hub alot. Clearly they have some work to do. The good news is that all hope is not lost. Since the hardware is pretty good and it's the software that's flawed, all we have to do is wait for them to fix it, right?Well - what's the first thing this \"TV\" did when I turned it on and connected it to the internet? It downloaded the latest software and rebooted itself!  After using this device (or any Smart TV) for a while, one thing will become clear. It's really not a TV. Think of it as a viewing appliance.  A computer-controlled cable tuner connected to a display. It boots when you turn it on.It's pretty quick, but you can tell it's booting.  Manufacturers love software based devices because they figure that they can fix it with an update. It doesn't have to be perfect when it ships. That could explain some of the problems people had early on, as well as why problems for some developed later.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEAUTIFUL PIC!

Well, in some ways...", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "RSPYD7ZDT9SEP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV and wanted to share some of my experiences so far, both good and bad. First, as a LED TV this thing rocks. The picture is bright, the sound is good, and the scanning rate on this thing makes HD content \"pop\" off the screen sometimes. Lots of adjustment choices in the menu for getting the display settings just right for you. It is slim, light weight, and comes with a decent stand if you decide not to wall mount it.The \"smart\" features are definitely a mixed bag of tricks. The main reason I bought this model was for the AllShare features...streaming content from my PC or my NAS to the nice 40 inch screen. Yes, it does have apps, but there are not that many and most are not that great. The only one that has been useful to me is the Fandango app - you can check movie times and watch trailers on the TV. So first I tried the built in wireless for streaming. This worked for Netflix and the music apps, but it could not handle the 1080p Blu-ray rips that I wanted to stream across my network to the TV. I had some long Ethernet cable, so I tried wired connection next. Much better! No skips or drops in the video at all....I am running a Gigabit network at home so that might be helping. My main issue with Samsung's AllShare streaming solution is the fact that YOU CAN'T STREAM FROM A NAS. You have all this great content that you want to stream, it take up gobs of space, and you put it on a network drive for safe keeping. Sorry, you should have put that in your computer! Ah well. I do have multiple drives on my main computer, but it would be nice to stream from a network location. Otherwise the AllShare client works well...it can even stream MKV files IF they are on your C: drive or E: or F: or G: =D. There are other DLNA servers out there like Serviio that will stream but most have the same problem with network storage.So, a great television that can be used for network watching, but you do have to make some adjustments to make it \"smart\".", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Youtube not streaming", "Author": "VA", "ReviewID": "R1ZG91B3IDCB9E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this led a week back and have problem in streaming youtube videos , i initially thought problem could be because of built in wifi, so i tried hard wiring it but the problem still exists and even i reloaded the app but no avail, so will be returning this tv and would rather buy a different one.On the good side the Netflix and hulu are streaming well.It does not have the amazon video app, also some apps are missing from 2011 model...", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV", "Author": "Saji", "ReviewID": "R1Z9XPBXWF8RSX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a TV it's an amazing product but the smart TV part sucks !!!!

That alone is a nice feature, no more cables to play your movies, just leave the movie files in your PC and access it from your TV wirelessly using media player installed in your windows 7. Another cool feauture is the added usb ports for you to plug in a usb with media files inside and play the avi's and mp4's in your TV. the CMR motion smoothing effect of the TV works well only on animated movies and watching sports, you get clear motion like 60-fps like effect.

This allows the TV to produce an amazing picture. I have used this with a DVD player, Blu-Ray player, laptop, cable, and over the air HD TV. All of them look crystal clear.3. Movie option: This is probably the best part about this TV. You can hook up your laptop to it via HDMI or just use a USB thumb drive. It does not matter how the USB is formatted [FAT 32 or NTFS] it will read it. It does not matter what file type you have .avi, .mp4, .wmv, .mkv, .mp3 it plays them all. I have tried to find a format that it does not play and I have not found one yet.This particular option on this TV is amazing. Most TV's will play music or photos but not videos.

For the past ninety minutes I've been trying to get it to stream Netflix (which is primarily what I bought the tv for).  I tried another brand (Visio) that had a button for Nexflix and set itself up almost instantly.  This tv doesn't have a Netflix button and you have to go searching for where to find it.  Once you do, you enter your email and password.  Then you get a nice screen that says \"watch movies & tv instantly\".  The screen tells you all about instant watching (like anyone who already has Netflix needs to read?).  And then nothing - no \"continue\" button or anything.  So I'll have to call tomorrow to figure out what the next step is.  If I was judging this tv on picture quality alone, it would get a high rating.  But the set up is not intuitive and so it is time consuming to figure out how to set it up.  I always am slow at setting up electronics.  But my last 40\" smart tv (that I returned because I couldn't get wireless headphones to work with it) was about 100 times easier.  It took me less than an hour to set up the Visio and I was watching a Netflix movie.  I'm really frustrated with this set.  Picture quality isn't everything!  This one was $200 more than the Visio.  So very frustrating.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Netflix not working", "Author": "John & Annie", "ReviewID": "R174PJYS22AN87", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just bought one of these last weekend and Netflix dosn't work.

It was a simple 40 inch LCD (LA40C530), with a 60Hz refresh rate. Nothing to brag about. But the picture was great, everything worked great - the TV was responsive, I could tune it the way I wanted to. And even with a 20 feet viewing distance, I could really enjoy the picture and sound quality. I would have rated it 5 stars.So, it was obvious, that when I had to move on to an LED TV, I didn't really consider anything but a Samsung. I did spend time reading a few reviews about Panasonic and LG but didn't give them much thought. My previous experience with LG had been that it just looks like a cheaper version of Samsung. The only reason I was considering them was the IPS panels.Yesterday, I brought home the (46 inch) UN46ES6150. I got a great deal at Costco where I got the Samsung Smart TV and the Samsung Smart Blue Ray player for $950 + taxes. The disappointment started right after I plugged the TV in.The first thing I noticed is how unresponsive the TV was to my button pushes on the remote. I ignored it, thinking I just need get used to it and then I made the mistake of going to the Smart Hub. Smart Hub, as most reviews put it, is terrible. It is such a poorly designed, completely unresponsive, completely unintuitive piece of junk (The Smart Hub on the Blue Ray player was actually slightly more responsive !).I don't have a cable connection yet, so I knew I was going to live off Netflix and Youtube for a few days. I got to Youtube and played a few good HD videos. The picture quality looked excellent, but only a for a while. As I moved around the house, I realized I should have got myself an IPS paneled TV. The colors and brightness just drop when you're not right in front of the TV. I had tried this out in a store before and I couldn't tell the difference a lot, but it was very obvious in my home, probably because of the softer lighting. With a much shorter viewing distance in this place (10 feet), the viewing angles are going to be more acute and this is something I can't live with.The real disappointment came when I started a few HD movie trailers on Youtube and witnessed the dreaded Soap Opera Effect ! I spent the next couple of hours trying to get rid of it. \"Switch of auto motion plus\" is what the Internet recommends - guess what, that option is disabled in Smart Hub mode. \"Switch to game mode\" is the other recommendation - guess what, the ES6000 series doesn't have a game mode !! Then I tried out a few suggested hacks where I started the Vudu application, played a 2 min demo and tried to turn off Auto Motion Plus - again, the option was disabled.It doesn't really matter by now, but the sound on the TV is pretty bad as well.This is terrible. Nothing about the TV has caught my attention so far. I'll be returning the TV this week and getting myself a Panasonic (either an LED or a Plasma). I no longer want a smart TV if this is how terrible Smart TVs are.Edit: After playing a lot with settings I've managed to get a much better picture and to get rid of the Soap Opera Effect. I've raised the rating from 1 star to 3 stars now. What still sucks is the small viewing angle and the software (the browser is unusable - I primarily use YouTube and NetFlix, which are barely bearable). Also, I've given up plans of switching to a plasma because of their power consumption and phosphor trailing effects.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Most of the Samsung apps like ChannelLive.TV, YuppTV are not available for this model.", "Author": "Suresh", "ReviewID": "R3VW14PTFE9YTI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The TV picture, sound are good.

Computers do it, other TVs do it, even my 15-year-old Sony HDTV had perfect color for the entire time I had it to the time it died and never had to be adjusted. But from the time I turned on this piece of c..p, I was continually trying to get a decent picture but usually everything looked surreal. Lime green sky one minute and mustard yellow the next. Adjust it to the mode you that looks best and the next minute it wanders off into a dull neverland. Get fine tuned adjustment the way you like it and five minutes later it's horrible. So why can't Samsung produce a TV where the color is not a joke? I took it back after two days of minute-by-minute adjustment frustration. Even with auto control turned off, the color was still unstable. Lucky I didn't hit it with a ball bat.Also, the motion in this TV is jittery, jumping from one scene to the next with visible discreteness...very disconcerting. 125 Hz framing? Yes, I know the source is only 16 or 24 Hz but the interpolation is terrible. On the other hand the picture was sharp when not jumping...give it one star.Another frustration was the use of the on-screen \"keyboard.\" This made using the browser unbearable. Cursor movement was excruciatingly slow so any internet function requiring feedback from my end was beyond the pale. I guess there must be a way to hook up a wireless keyboard but I didn't keep the unit long enough to find out.Don't go near this one.
