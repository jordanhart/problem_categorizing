{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Duckquin", "ReviewID": "R27X20CCFS2MTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received this TV a couple of days ago and was very satisfied with everything it has. It's very lightweight, as a petite female, I was able to screw the TV to its stand and lift it to the table. Setup was easy, I was able to watch Netflix in a couple of minutes. In the beginning, the lighted Vizio logo was very annoying, till I found out that I was able to turn it off from the TV menu.I sorta got an info overload from the Apps; so far I only setup Netflix and Yahoo! weather, the rest can wait (or I'll never use, due to the clumsy keyboard on the remote). List of preinstalled apps: Rhapsody, Yahoo! (Finance, Weather, News & Store), flickr, Netflix, Vudu, Hulu Plus, Amazon, YouTube, Skype, Twitter and Facebook.Remote is ok (see attached pic). Too many small buttons on both sides, accidental pressing of the buttons can't be avoided.One feature that this TV doesn't have (and my old dear tube TV from the 1990s had) is the wakeup feature. It has sleep feature though. Why not both? Hmmm...Please note that this model is better than its cousin M420SL. Dynamic Contrast Ratio for SL 200,000:1 and KD (this model) 1,000,000:1.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just OK", "Author": "akreader", "ReviewID": "R3TFYLWWSZFALA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was pretty excited to find this TV at first. Under $600 for a smart tv with four HDMI ports and a 120 Hz refresh speed? That should be awesome. The speakers in the front were a plus for me too, because most LCDs have rear or bottom facing speakers resulting in rather poor sound quality.But I gotta say, after having this TV for a week, I am somewhat disappointed.  Here are my issues:1. The internet apps are terrible. Netflix doesn't have captioning and Amazon Instant Video doesn't even display the video choices correctly (so you can't see what movies are available until you directly scroll over each individual selection). I e-mailed Vizio about this to see if these apps could be updated in any way. Nope. I was just stuck with third-rate apps that couldn't hold a candle to my Roku. So I reconnected the Roku to my TV, which works fine, only it begs the question: why have a \"smart\" TV at all if you're just using your Roku? (Most Blu-Ray players have app functions these days too. I've really come to the conclusion that \"smart\" TVs are a waste of money.)2. The remote is clunky and heavy. The QWERTY keyboard didn't even work on mine, which isn't a big deal because I don't really know what I'd use it for anyway. The buttons on the remote are super-small. Normally I wouldn't really complain about something as trivial as the remote, but this one is really remarkably bad.3. The sound really isn't that good. It seems like most LCD TVs have poor sound so that's not typically an issue. But one of the selling points of this TV is that it has the front spacing speakers with \"surround sound\". The sound has a lot of hisses and so forth. Again, not remarkably terrible for LCD TVs, but not good either.All in all I think this TV still presents good value for the money. It looks good and I think the picture is at least adequate for TVs in its class. I just wish they'd come out with decent apps and a usable remote. I'd recommend checking out this TV if you really have your heart set on a \"smart\" TV but don't have a ton of money to spend. But otherwise I think you're better off going with a high quality not-smart TV and hooking up a Roku or Apple TV.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty good TV, but slow response on the internet apps", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R1LHHVJL8QKBE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall a good TV. Picture quality is good, contrast and brightness leaves nothing to be desired, refresh rate and 120Hz is quite nice.The response time when starting the Internet Apps, such as Netflix or Pandora, takes about 30 seconds if you're starting them up for the first time after turning on the TV. Also, it comes with a lot of apps that I didn't find useful. These can be uninstalled though, and new ones installed. Pandora isn't pre-installed, but can be downloaded easily. General TV turn-on time is also a bit longer than I'd like, about about 15 seconds.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "JayBee", "ReviewID": "R13OYQB0YHLMC2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I couldn't find it cheaper anywhere else. As for the TV, I've very pleased with it. Its a little sluggish in the Smart TV apps area, and you can't run the apps in the background, like Pandora playing while you watch something, but why would you need to I guess. Would be cool to watch the game and listen to music at the same time for parties etc, but I have a stereo so w/e. Great picture once you tune the settings, and the blacks and contrast are great.I am disappointed with the wireless file transfer/media server though. I thought I would be able to integrate with my network and stream video etc, but it isn't possible. Not even possible with a movie on a USBdrive..I think the new Vizio Tv box lets you do this, but I wish they would update their TV software...", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is going back", "Author": "P. Radcliffe", "ReviewID": "RUR6R7XF4Z9FZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this at Costco, not Amazon.  We have had it about a week and it is going back to the store.  The good: My husband says it was reasonably easy to set up though he did have to call Vizio customer service twice.  Customer service was easy to reach, very helpful and friendly.  The picture is good with some channels outstanding.  The bad: (1) The sound is awful.  Very tinny with audible hissss sound with the \"S's.\"  Sounds like a cheap radio. We diddled with the audio settings per instructions from Vizio but it made almost no difference.  I understand that the speakers on these thin sets are not great, but there has to be a 42\" screen out there with better audio than this.  No way to attach external speakers.  (2) Takes forever to change channels or go to on-demand or DVR.  Black screen just seems to sit there forever.  Together, these two issues are deal breakers for us.  Other problems for us (though I did not factor them into my rating): The volume range is rather limited, i.e., the top volume is loud but nowhere near as loud as other TV's I've owned.  You need to adjust the volume bar pretty far up to get a moderate level and we can't find an internal adjustment for this.  The stand does not swivel.  Sorry, but I can't comment on the Smart TV features.  Because of the audio and slow channel surfing we didn't bother trying out these features.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving this TV", "Author": "Wild Woman", "ReviewID": "R31LOY525XJZ8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this because of a great price at Costco and because Costco doubles the one year warranty and has \"concierge\" ( in home) service if you have problems.

Chang \"Aacidus\"", "ReviewID": "RTRASCKXYB1O5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had the model E422VLE and it surpasses this model in many ways.The brightness levels were better, the ambient light sensor was more sensitive/accurate, and the Netflix app had Closed Caption and Audio Settings available.There is no way to update the apps at the moment.The M420KD, has kind of a foggy/opaque  display brightness to it. Sure it can be corrected, but only to a certain point.The HDMI inputs are all on the left side of the set, this might be an inconvenience to many, since the cables will not be discrete.Unlike many other sets out there, this one has an ethernet port for a more stable connection.As for the price, I got a good deal at Costco. This set is light and thin. The Vizio logo, looks cool and you can turn on or off. It is compromised of many LEDs. If you turn the logo off, the hdtv set actually looks elegant.This set will play avi, mp4, h264 and so on, the only files that it will not play from my library are mkv's. No biggie since my Blu-ray player can take care of that. It supporst USB and DLNA connectivity, it grabs share from my router and from computers that are sharing media in the house.If you can get this set for less than the $600 that amazon is asking for, get it! There are no other sets out there available in this price range that has 120Hz, LED (edge-lit), 4 HDMI ports, and is a SMART TV.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vizio LED TV", "Author": "S.

First off, the picture is absolutely incredible. I would say roughly equivalent to other televisions costing twice as much.  The remote is fine. I have not accidentally hit one of the reverse side keyboard buttons once. It is a bit slow to process what you are typing when entering text like passwords, but I'm not planning on using it as a word processor. Netflix also works well and is not slow by my standards.  The only knit is I could not connect through wifi with my tethered Iphone4. It's a known issue, but there's no solution.

Wolfson", "ReviewID": "R2RCMJQU07TECV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Television randomly loses power after less than 10 hours of watching. Vizio would not back the warranty because they told me connect buy (amazon reseller) was not an authorized reseller. Connect buy would not back the television because it was past 30 days when this problem started to occur. (this tv is in a second home and we have watched less than 10 hours when problem started) Have filed an A-Z complaint with Amazon. Connect Buy is trying to correct the problem but will not pay shipping back to them. They sold me a broken television that the Manufacturer will not back because they claim that connect buy is not a authorized seller and further claimed that bj wholesale club bought the television from them and not connect buy. Vizio, Amazon and Connect Buy have really screwed up and have been very difficult to work with. Never ever buy a Vizio again.

So I have a decent amount of TV's to compare this product against.Review:People, please take the time to tune your settings, the TV will not look amazing right out of the box! Take 30-45 mins out of your busy schedule and fine tune the picture settings. The best advice I can give you is TURN OFF Ambient Light Sensor, it dulls the TV. Turning that off will solve the issue for most of the people saying that the screen is not bright enough.After tuning the picture settings, movies and games look amazing to me! Almost as good as my Sharp 60 inch. I cannot find a fault with the picture quality at all. Like I said, please take the time to fine tune the TV.There are over a 100 apps currently on this TV and I think that is amazing for the price I paid. Most of them work pretty well. The remote is also not as bad as everyone says it is, but it could be better. The QWERTY keypad works pretty well on my remote, so no issues there.People complaining about the sound, please buy a true 5.1 or 7.1 SRS. Even if the TV says SRS, the volume is coming from one direction! SRS speakers are placed all around the room, thus the name Surround Sound! Coming back to the TV speakers, they are much better than a lot of LED TVs I have seen, they are very decent for a small-medium sized room.All in all, I really don't think you can beat this TV in this price range. I would definitely recommend it if you have a small budget for a TV.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Value for the Price Paid", "Author": "Primal Strings", "ReviewID": "R1OH0RNM5ZIU6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife picked one of these up at Costco as a birthday gift for me.  As with any TV, I had to play with the image settings to get the picture right for our location, but, once it's dialed in, the picture is pretty great.  The sound isn't bad for most normal shows, but, for movies, the dialog is quickly washed out by the sound effects.  My quick fix was running it into our stereo with a 3.5mm-to-RCA cable I had lying around.We don't use the web apps, since we've using a Roku box for some time, now, so, I can't speak to their speed or usability.The biggest selling point was the inclusion of 2 USB ports, and, the TV will play *.mp4 files through the USB port, directly from an external hard drive; HUGE bonus.All in all, the M420KD paired with a decent audio system (it doesn't have to be super high-end) is a very good setup at a great price for casual watching and a weekly family movie night.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing quality for the price!", "Author": "Lovergirl", "ReviewID": "R10VBATVL34ESS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The tv is perfect, I've had it for almost a year now and it still works as if brand new.

I have the TV mounted on the wall and used closed channel ducts to run the cables to a Blue Ray player and an X-Box.  I also have the wireless setup to work on the 5GHz frequency for my wireless router.  Here is what I liked:1.  Setting up the TV was very easy.  The set was light enough that I could lift it up onto the wall mount by myself.  Naming the inputs for the HDMI cables was very easy and configuring the Wireless took very little time.2.  While I am not a fan of the double sided remote (much preferred the earlier version where a keyboard slid out from the side of the unit), it does work and is not too bad once you get used to it.3.  Since I mostly use Amazon Prime for movies, that app was very important to me.  It works very well and I only had one issue with it which was easily resolved by doing an update on the TV.4.  I use the 5GHz band on my wireless router for entertainment systems and the 2.4 GHz band for laptops and computers.  Having this TV support both bands was very important to me and it works perfectly.  I have excellent range with this unit.5.  I have had the TV installed for over a year now and it works perfectly!  I have had absolutely NO issues with it.Things that I did not like:Audio is good, but not great.  A sound bar should really not be an option and should be included with the set.
