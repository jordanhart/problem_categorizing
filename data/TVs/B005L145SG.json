I transitioned this to a PC monitor and it works great. Never fails and super reliable. I have it connected via HDMI from my PC and it syncs with no issues. Plus the TV Tuner is nice and is cheaper than some Monitors without sound.Bought from costco for $179.99. Great gamer tv and the features are awesome. sound has a 5 band equalizer and the settings are great. 3 hdmi and other connections make this a very versatile hdtv. Setup was easy and comparable tv is $100 more.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "NO DIGITAL CHANNELS WORK", "Author": "Mike L", "ReviewID": "R3GTE3MG04RMXX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "All HD Channels don't work.It would show the HD Channel's for around 30 seconds, then shut off.I know it is not the cable provider, because I tested it at different locations, and other TV's that I have work.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good LED TV for the price!", "Author": "onesolo", "ReviewID": "R1GTBNBG5CKCMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picture is really good.

Set it up, ran it briefly and over the next month ran it about 4 hours.  Then dead.  First customer \"service\" told me to ship at my expense, after my squawking they offered \"reduced price shipping.\" On, 2/7/12, a free shipping label was approved.  Six outgoing emails, three incoming emails, three calls to the outsourced call center and still waiting for a shipping label.  Flat refusal to put me in touch with US support. This company is committing commercial suicide in the US.  Buy at your peril!", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture", "Author": "Kevin D.
