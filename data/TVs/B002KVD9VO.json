{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not for older components!", "Author": "MollyDawg", "ReviewID": "R1GU35QY5DFOWW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first LCD HD purchase. (I'm late to the party.) I chose Samsung, and paid a premium, for one silly feature, which is an on/off timer. Most TVs have sleep timers, but I used my little old 14\" JVC to wake up! I couldn't find a reliable maker of LCDs that included an on timer except Samsumg. It not only has an on timer, it has three! Perfect for when you're going to be away and want your TV to go off and on at different intervals to make it appear that someone is home. And of course, to serve as my alarm clock.Sadly, I had to return the unit the following day. Why? Because even though the specs say that it has one composite and one component input, you can only use one or the other as it only has one video jack. Depending on your cable, you plug the video link into the one jack, and the audio into either of the remaining based on whether it's composite or component. You cannot have two machines. I had my old VCR (yes, how quaint that I still use one) and a middle-aged DVD player--one of each. Of course if you have later model attachments, you can use the HDMI, etc. But be advised, this set has limitations for older toys.As for the sound quality I have read about here and on other sites, I didn't notice anything particularly wrong with it. There are about 5 different settings and admittedly one of them is tinny, but the sound was much richer when set to \"movie,\" and it includes an equalizer of sorts. The sound was perfectly enjoyable. So if connecting components doesn't mean anything to you, I recommend it for bedroom or kitchen placement.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good for price", "Author": "Spartan Basketball", "ReviewID": "R18R5TJYE52G4K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This LCD TV is great for the price.  Perfect size for my home office.  I have no issue with the picture or the sound.  People need to be realistic.  It is a 22\" TV, not meant to be the focal point of a home theatre.  Easy plug and play setup takes about 5 minutes from box to functionality.", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "Lang M. Ho \"Just Another Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3BDK0EXU5ZWCJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is one of the cheapest 22\" LCD HDTVs out there.  And you get what you pay for.  When I opened it and set it up it seemed fine aside from a rather flimsy stand.  It worked great for a couple weeks (aside from the first time I tried to connect my PC to it).  Then it would start acting up while I was playing Xbox.  Either losing the picture completely or having it keep automatically adjusting the screen size, changing tints and shades, you name it and it freaked out in that manner.  It stabilized itself and stopped doing that, but I have no idea what caused it and basically am just waiting for it to do it again.  Do yourself a favor and remember that you get what you pay for, low price means low quality.UPDATE:  I would not recommend this product under any circumstances.  I had the picture go out or get messed up at least (literally, no joke) 15 times while trying to watch a movie last night.  And for anyone wondering if it might be just the component jacks, well, I switch it over to cable just long enough to catch half a car chase on some cop show (I'd be more specific on the title, but the TV didn't stay on long enough for me to see it).  At this point I would deem it inoperable and am in the process of returning it.I would also like to add that a lot of the features on the TV make me believe that the TV is not actually made by Samsung, but rather a different company that has coordinated a deal with Samsung to allow the Samsung name to be placed on it.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "High Quality at a Bargain Price", "Author": "C. Stricklen", "ReviewID": "RKM3CES0L4I3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this in my office for about a year and I couldn't be more pleased. The picture is as good as any 720P I have seen. The sound goes well with the screen size (i.e. the set is designed for a small room), so you might want to crank it up a bit more than usual, but the sound doesn't get tinny at higher volume.Custom adjustments for picture and sound through the remote menus are extensive, but if you're not inclined to tinker with things, the default settings are just about perfect. I played with all of the adjustments and ended up leaving just about everything as it was in the beginning.I actually prefer the more realistic tones of Plasma--I have Panasonic Viera and Sony XBR in other parts of my home--but this little Samsung can hold its own against them. That shouldn't be surprising, really--Samsung makes some of the best LED TVs out there, and this one lives up to that reputation.My only explanation for the one-star review I saw is that it must have been a lemon. That happens with electronics regardless of price. This is a solid set.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad source", "Author": "Doctor", "ReviewID": "R3SBTYXYX1J3GI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv from Tech For Less on amazon.com and although it was supposed to come with its original remote control, it was missing. I was never sent a replacement remote control. I also purchased a refurbished 32\" HDTV from Tech For Less and there are problems with turning the tv on. Sometimes it will not turn on with the original remote control, the universal remote, nor the power button on the tv. I do not recommend Tech For Less. This 22-in tv is great for any situation where you would want a smaller tv.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Surprising Speakers", "Author": "Randall G. Mathis", "ReviewID": "R2C49505CMQMP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this television for approximately six months and I feel as though I am well qualified to judge the quality of this television.  This is an excellent television for the money.  When you pick it up you will be surprised by how light it is and you may believe that it is a poor quality product.  Don't be fooled.  Unless you are in the habit of carrying your television around and/or beating on it the durability of the shell won't be an issue.  The piano black finish is beautiful and has held up these many months just inches from my kitchen sink and directly in front of three windows.  This is a quality product.Before I purchased this product I tried several small televisions for my 15' x 11' kitchen and every one of them failed when it came to sound.  I even went so far as to hook up computer speakers in order to compensate for the weak speakers of many small televisions.  The speakers in this television are excellent when compared to the others that I have tried and I would put them up against any television in it's price and size categories.  I no longer need those ugly computer speakers in my kitchen.The picture is true Samsung quality.  I have a Samsung 46A650 that I purchased from Amazon and it's clear that the people who created that gem had a hand in creating this television.When I first bought it I tried to calibrate it by hooking up a bluray player and I accidentally left it on 1080p and I was surprised to find that this television can accept such a signal.  It does down convert the signal to 720p because it has to (it doesn't have enough pixels to display 1080p) but the picture was amazing.  The only tweaks that I needed to make were to the brightness and contrast which should be adjusted on every television.  There aren't a lot of adjustments available on this model but the picture is very good.I have not tried the built in tuner so I can't comment on that.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "samsung LN22B350 22=INCH 720p LCD HDTV BLACK", "Author": "Wennetta C.
