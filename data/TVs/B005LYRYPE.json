I was apprehensive about the quality of the picture since you can not tune or adjust them properly while in the store.  I am a SAMSUNG fanatic.  I get the TV home and set it up in minutes, but concerned about the picture.  The mistake made was using the  picture settings I normally selected with my Samsung.  I used the following settings for the STANDARD picture setting and I AM BLOWN AWAY at the quality and depth of this picture.  It actually, I thought I would never say this, has a picture quality better than the Samsung.  Those of you that don't agree, that's OK, I am pleased beyond expectation with my new Sharp 70\" led.  Blu-ray is breathtaking and the VUDU Apps delivered incredible picture quality via the internet.This set is HUGE so make sure you can sit back at least 10 feet from the screen.  Some of the menu items and APPS are confusing, but take the time to experiment with this TV, you will be pleased.

I am so satisfied with this purchase!You really cannot appreciate the picture until you set it up at home,on 1080I/P and have time to \"tweak\" it.Having installed some 250 TV's this year, that's part of my job, I have seen all brands, types, claims and trust me, this TV is vastly superior to anything I have ever had the pleasure of setting my eyes on.  (Don't be swayed by the 120hz, you cannot tell the difference over 240hz unless you create a test picture, don't spend a lot of extra money for 240hz, it is media hype.)Settings are a bit tricky, but well worth the fiddling time.  To get the best picture, you should raise the \"contrast\" while watching the brighter parts of the image, and the \"brightness\" while watching the black areas.  The trick is to bring up the blacks using the brightness  verrrrry slowly, a touch at a time, just a little brightness to the \"brighter blacks\", yes, brighter blacks,a result of the 8,000,000/1 contrast ratio.  Example, I was able to see the lunar eclipse, faint black on black, while the announcer appologized for the screen looking totally black!  Imagine shades of black, it is a trip, for sure.  If you don't set up the contrast and brightness correctly, night scenes will turn brownish, but just keep slowly adding brightness till it becomes rock solid.  The picture is utterly amazing, I am not kidding.We have our's mounted on a swivel pin floor stand, and we easly swing the direction of the TV over a 40 degree range, only because it is so lightweight for it's huge size.Also, SIZE MATTERS, when you sit 10' away, you get the giant theater experience, yet, when watching from an adjacent room 20' away you can still read all of the fine print.  Since owning this 70\" TV, I have decided that my favorite actor's head should be AT LEAST 20 inches TALL, 3x real life.I have always believed that unless you have to move your head to watch TV, the viewing screen is too small!Go Ahead, buy this one, TV will never be the same!", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "SHARP AQUOS LC-70LE632U 70\"", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R1WYSPOOJGJI39", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this on a Black Friday weekend sale and couldn't be happier.  The picture is fantastic.  Bluray, Xbox 360, and other 1080 sources look amazing.  Havent noticed any motion blur yet; 120Hz is plenty. Slight darkening in the corners, but that can be expected on LCDs, and it is barely discernible. The speakers are... there, but I don't know anyone that expects blockbuster sound out of a flat screen, nor anyone that would buy a 70\" TV without a home theater system.  Overall I am truly happy with the picture quality and features offered on this set.  A note about Quattron: this TV does not have it, but shopping around in a few stores with Quattron models playing, I honestly couldnt tell the difference.  You be the judge, but the price difference to go to the 732 w/ Quattron amounted to about 30% more, and wasnt worth it to me.The one downside I've found so far as can somewhat be expected with a screen this large, is that non-1080/full HD sources are sub-par, but I feel that this is more the underlying distortion being magnified rather than an issue with the TV itself. Keep in mind that not all HD programming on cable/satelite are created equal, and you'll notice those programs cheating with 720 immediately.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "One word..

Ok.. it is not all the bad. But my set is free from clouding issues. With regards to viewing angles.. yes.. at about 45 degrees - things look washed but who sits at that angle anywaysAnyhow... my take on this TV.. BIG BANG FOR THE BUCK! It is so good that you have to see it to believe it. Don't judge it by what you see in the store. At home - this looks big, clear and vivid. Takes some adjusting and you can find hints on how to adjust all over the web but in the end it is worth itBlacks are almost close to plasma and whites are really whites (no yellowish, reddish or bluish). Movie mode is a must and Film should be turned off (unless you like SOE)The best feature of all - it is not reflective. So in a bright room - it is very clear.One small issue.. movie mode with all the other settings I have does require heavy video processing so using HDMI 1.3 compliant receiver is a MUST. Component will result in lip sync issues. I bought an AVR-1312 to go with it after much research and I am very happy. So don't plug this via component or composite and expect wonders - you will be disappointedOh.. one other thing - adjust the TV after turning the lights off and then turn OPC on.

I was concerned about the low price compared to other large LCD flat screens I was comparing.  I was about to pull the trigger on a $5K 3D but after reading the reviews on this LCD I took the plunge.  WOW!  You will not be disappointed.  I won't bore with technical jargon because in the end what matters to most of us is how clear the picture is and how true are the colors.  Picture yourself looking out of a 70 inch window watching a live scene.  That is what this is like.  At first it is a bit unnerving because you see your favorite newscaster, for example, like you never have seen them before with all the blemishes and almost as if you are in the studio with them.  Trust me, it took me back because it is so lifelike it almost looks 3D without the glasses.You will not be disappointed if you are looking for an incredible picture unless you only have standard definition channels or try to use this as a huge SD TV.  I am not so concerned about the menu/user interface as i dont spend my time adjusting every aspect of the picture.  I will play around with the settings but always end up resetting back to defaults with better results.  I also dont care about audio because like most that own huge flatscreens we have surround sound systems that are designed for awesome audio reproduction.  IOW I want my TV to give me awesome picture and not try to be an audio system.  I also have three large TVs in the same room and i switch audio between them.

I exchanged my Sammy 59D7000 for some dead pixels and decided to try something different. I calibrated both TV's from settings found on AVS forums, and tweaked with my own WOW disk. This TV is amazing. Firstly, the sheer size will amaze you. Secondly, the picture is, to me, much better than the edge-lit Samsung I returned for it. Full array really makes a big difference. I use OTA and QAM as HD sources and they both look great. Honestly, the standard cable channels don't look that bad either. Better than the Sammy looked on SD. I have had zero issues. I have not yet messed around with the internet applications, so I can't comment on those.I will post the calibration settings, but remember, these are only a starting point as the same panel can vary slightly. I plan to follow up this review after I've had some more time to watch and tweak it.**2 Week Edit**Only complaint I have so far is that in sheer white scenes you can see a slight diamond pattern. Only reason that I notice it is because I read about, then looked for it. It doesn't bother me and I've only seen it two times when the screen was completely white (T-Mobile commercial). I guess I could see how it would be bothersome for someone who watches a lot of hockey. Otherwise I wouldn't even call it an issue.I have found that Game mode works best for me. I had some lip sync issues in movie mode because even with all the extras turned off, there is still some processing and longer response times. So at this point I have found GAME mode to work best all around and really like the way everything looks. Here are my GAME mode settings that I use for everything.....Enjoy!

I was considering a 65 inch Panasonic plasma because of the great picture quality and was doubtful about this one.

Taylor \"photogeek\"", "ReviewID": "R31JCN1RZ9G6BW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "LC-70LE632U is last year's model, without the Quad pixel technology, slightly lighter than the current LC-70LE732U and perhaps uses a bit more energy. The picture looks great for a 70 inch-er. Basically the larger the screen, the more quality will suffer, so reviews about picture quality really aren't fair unless you compare them with others in the same size class. With that said, pure 1080p content still looks awesome, but you certainly can start to notice the different picture qualities accordingly (1080p, 720p, 480i, etc). Those with discriminating vision (or sit a bit too close) will notice a sharpness difference between 70\" sets and smaller TVs.I found some of the options/controls a little awkward, although I've seen worse. Generally speaking, TV makers stink at UI design -- thankfully once you setup the TV, you don't have to visit this too often. On the upside, I like the way DLNA is implemented and seems to work well with most formats I have.A hidden gem of the TV is ARC -- which eliminates the need for extra cables to route sound originating from the TV back to the receiver (rca or optical). ARC works flawlessly with my receiver (Onkyo TX-SR702) -- which makes switching between the TV and receiver sources trivial.Keep in mind this TV is nearly 100 lbs with the stand. Not many TV tables are designed for the weight and/or size of this TV, so plan accordingly.I've been reading several reviews regarding how much (if any) is impacted by \"quad pixel\" technology. Most serious AV reviewers recommend disabling the \"yellow\" pixel in quattron TVs -- since one of the few major differences between this TV and the newer model is the quad pixel -- save yourself the cash if this set is deeply discounted (great sale/clearance). Based on the collective opinion of most well regarding AV experts, \"quattron\" technology seems even more of a marketing BS/hype than 3D -- if you don't mind paying nearly $1K more, Sharp has a model with both.I wish the streaming media library was more extensive (apps). Amazon Instant would be nice, but a rare item on TVs. Considering most \"boxes\" (blu-ray players, PS3, Roku) connected to this TV generally have all internet/network enabled features in a more comprehensive and better UI anyway -- I would prefer a cheaper non-network-enabled model. Again, this is an area TV makers generally fail at. However, Sharp's interface isn't bad and might be fine for someone without a network enabled device.I wasn't willing to pay the 240htz tax (nearly $300-500 more) since 120htz looks fine to my eyes, but it would have been a nice feature to optionally disable. :-)I gave it 4 stars because of some awkward UI choices and missing some important internet apps -- based on current internet sale prices. I would automatically promote it to 5 stars if you can find this on a clearance sale (deep discount [I did!]).", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally a large, flat screen TV worth spending money on!", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "RIHEXKKWTOFBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am quite choosy when it comes to TVs and similar electronics; what most consider \"good\" for me is unbearable. Hence, I could not force myself to buy a plasma as most of them emit a relatively loud hum (and even the most expensive ones are not that bright or even reliable); or an LCD as they had other problems, mostly with color compression, poor lighting and bad viewing angle. It seemed that I would have to get a KURO to satisfy my need for a TV with decent picture, except that KURO is not made any more and is still quite expensive for the size.And then Sharp came up with this TV.The first impression was - WOW.The second impression was even better: when one starts looking for faults on this TV, it is hard to find them. For instance, while most LCDs and Plasmas have terrible sound which makes the TV useless without external speakers, Sharp LEDs have excellent sound (for a TV). So, if you are not yet setup for a separate surround sound system, you will be just fine with the built in speakers until you make the switch. Even more importantly, the more I dug into the menus, the more I was surprised with its ease of use and intuitiveness, and range of options. This TV was designed by someone very smart.So what is it that is so good about it?- Enormous size. Only one LED TV in the world is larger than this one as far as I know (80 inch Sharp LED). Sit about 8-10 ft away from it, turn off the lights, and you have a REAL home cinema, not just an empty promise. Your entire field of view will be filled with the wonderful picture and you will discover things in movies that you never noticed before. Actors performances are more detailed, picture is rich in every respect, even film grain is apparent (provided you don't kill it with poor settings).- Fantastic brightness and uniformity. This TV has a full array LED lit screen; not just edges, but entire panel. That's a big advantage compared to its slightly smaller 60 in sibling. The only place that has slight fall off is corners, the one or two inches in corners, but it is very slight and not a problem at all. Having slightly darker corners is omnipresent in photography and theaters due to lens optics so we are all used to it and do not even notice it.- Fantastic range of options in terms of color and contrast. I am still experimenting with my settings, so I will not post any here, but I was really happy to see that there is a whole range of options which will satisfy even people like myself. Since it also has an RS-232 PC connection, I assume it can be callibrated too.- Yes, I have not even opened the user manual. Haven't even touched it, and you can tell as I actually still don't know everything there is to know about this TV. But that is a good thing as it is a testament to its ease of use. I don't use cable TV but an antenna instead and even that was a breeze. The receiver found some 60-70 channels... with picture better than from cable. A lot of TVs don't have a good receiver, but this one shines.- I am typing this while using the TV as my computer monitor. It is kinda cool to be able to sit relaxed on a sofa and use a computer via the 70\" TV screen with the wireless keyboard in my lap and wireless mouse on the side table. You have to try it sometime, its a blast. It is also much healthier for ones eyes.- As far as connectivity, this TV has it all: wireless internet, menus which allow one to connect to netflix, cinemanow, blockbuster, and others, and even a little portal which gives access to some internet services such as weather, news and so on. It also has a few HDMI inputs, standard AV inputs, standard VGA input for a computer, component inputs, audio in and out, USB and so on. Setting up the wireless connection was a breeze. Actually, setting up anything on this TV is a breeze.- The TV has no hum at all and after having it for a month, I cannot find one fault with it. Perfect picture, great viewing angle, no buzzing, no hum, nothing stupid going on. Even the normally challenging computer signal is displayed very well, with great color uniformity. The only problem I ever had came from my BD player: panasonic Viera was ON, and every time I used play button on the BD remote, it would switch the input on the TV. That is - until I finally realized I should turn the Viera link OFF...- Did I say that watching movies on it is better than going to a theatre?Interestingly enough, playing well authored DVDs on it produces picture that is marginally worse than blurays, so one does not necessarily have to buy all those films on bluray again, although well authored blurays do look absolutely amazing. I am using Panasonic DMP-BD75 if you are curious.I am sure I am forgetting to mention some other great points about this TV, but basically whatever good things you have heard of it, it is all true. I really cannot find a fault with it, no matter how hard I try. Even if some picture setting is not great, there are many other options, and one just needs to find those which one likes. For instance, I really don't like motion compensation, noise reduction, and other similar filters, so I have them all OFF. Truly, that may be the one best feature of this TV: perfectly easy to use, without being dumb. Other companies should follow suit and realize that customers are not crazy about dumb products.This TV is one incredibly smart product, with fantastic picture and at a price which leaves one with no excuse not to buy it.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Red vertical band, known issue with Sharp TVs", "Author": "SV.TV", "ReviewID": "R2B9PLQF1OAZ78", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Typical cloudiness, poor picture quality overall, but as big as can be.

I really don't understand all of the reviews on this tv but have to assume many of these owners have not owned another high end larger tv to compare it to.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "The Witchdoctor", "ReviewID": "RVY3YHRKB1ZS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATENovember 28, 2013This TV is still going strong and I've had no problems whatsoever.  I've updated the firmware once.  Unfortunately, the update didn't contain apps for Amazon Prime or Netflix.  Just Vudu, which is useless to me.  I have recently bought a Vizio S3821w-C0R sound bar and connected it to the TV.  So, I have a v1.4 HDMI cable from my computer to my TV.  The TV's HDMI port is only v1.3, but v1.4 cables are just so cheap these days it doesn't make a difference.  Then, from my TV, I use an optical cable to connect it to the sound bar.  The TV passes the DTS, AC3 or PCM sound it receives from the TV through to the sound bar, which is spectacular.  Now I don't use the built in TV speakers.  I only use the sound bar.  It does have an ARC (audio return channel) HDMI port, which means you can control your TV and sound bar with your Sharp TV remote, but my sound bar doesn't have HDMI ARC functionality.  In summary, the picture is still great, and it has no trouble passing surround sound information on to a sound bar connected to the TV via optical cable. After a year, the TV still has all the connectivity you'll need for today's peripherals.  This TV is still great.  Sharp did a fantastic job.March 19, 2012Previously I had an LG 50\" 720p Plasma TV.  This 1080p TV is much better because of the upgrade in both size and resolution.I connect this TV to my computer and use it as an extra monitor.  Since I don't have cable TV, I download and stream all my content, which looks great on the TV.I also play computer-based video games (Batman Arkham Asylum, MotoGP) on this TV and they all look great.As for colour reproduction, this can be easily tuned by anyone.If you look closely at the colour gamut of this TV, it actually uses the extended gamut already.  Because of this, I didn't see the need to get the quattron version, which is a huge gimmick.  Read up on the extended gamut of this TV and compare it to the benefits of having an extra yellow pixel and you'll probably see that there is no content out there than can every make full use of this extended gamut, let alone the additional colour subtleties offered by the yellow pixel.The HDMI connection for this TV is version 1.3, not 1.4!  So don't get hustled into buying a HDMI cable that is more expensive than necessary.As such, when you connect your HDMI source to this TV, the TV will tell you the incoming signal source is 60Hz.  This number is different from the 120Hz LCD refresh rate.  Again, the numbers and labels seem similar but mean different things, so do your reading to understand what you're buying and the true context of all these numbers.The screen is slightly glossy.  In the bright sun, it is easier to see the images than on my previous plasma, but that being said, it still gets washed out a bit and I do have to close the curtains.The speakers are more than powerful enough for my room. (18ft x 18ft, I sit 14 feet away from the TV).The built in apps are useless so don't bother with them.The remote is easy to use and buttons responsive.I am very happy with my purchase and would absolutely buy this TV again.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, just have to tune the settings", "Author": "pj", "ReviewID": "RAAGP0DLJKN3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT TV, Electronix Express was a pleasure to deal with.
