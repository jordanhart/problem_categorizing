I've bought a few plasmas and LCD's previously, and this TV blows them all away.  This is a great price point, size and brand name TV.  You can't go wrong really, you will most certainly be satisfied.  The 120hz setting on Clear works best, otherwise gives your TV content a weird soap opera look, so either set it to Clear or turn it off.  This LCD works great with a PS3 also, and supports 1080p/24hz resolution, so when you watch blurays, the picture is crystal clear.  If you experience any input lag when playing games (delay from button press to action on screen), try setting the source name of your PS3 to PC, it seems to fix that issue pretty well.The sound on this TV is very robust and clear, although when watching blurays I have to turn it up to hear dialogs, which then makes action sequences really loud, but it's not a big deal.The design of this TV is just awesome.  It has the glass bezel and gloss table top, definitely one of the best looking TV's that I've ever seen.  The stand also swivels, which is something every TV should have, but usually don't.The remote works well, and is very sturdy.  The onscreen menus are very clear and even provide descriptions to most of the settings so you don't need to try and figure out what certain settings do.Its a pretty thin and light panel too, so if your mounting it, it should stay pretty flat on the wall.I've got nothing but positives to say about this set, its worth every penny, and I'm usually very critical about electronics, but I'd recommend this LCD to anyone.  It doesn't look that great out of the box, but after a week of playing with the color settings, I think the picture has been perfected.UPDATEHere are my picture settings for anyone that needs a little help getting startedMode: StandardBacklight: 14Contrast: 80Brightness: 40Sharpness: 20Color: 51Tint: G48/R52Eco Solution: all offEdge Enhancement: offDigital Noise Filter: Low (though I'm sure auto is about the same)MPEG Noise: LowColor Tone: Normal (some people seem to like the Warm settings)Auto Motion Plus 120HZ: Off (I didn't really like this feature)If you have any adjustments to these, let me know", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Time for an upgrade!", "Author": "Paul Pacis", "ReviewID": "R1JNP785ZCU81E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have literally been following the prices of HDTV's for about a year now, and there is no better time for an upgrade! Samsung just released their new \"C\" series, and somehow they are remarkably less expensive than their pre-existing models! The majority of the websites are selling this HDTV for $800+, Amazon's lower-than-low price is less than the rest of the market. I purchased it here on Amazon, and received my HDTV in 5 days (could have been 4 days, but I had school all day). CEVA did the shipping for my HDTV, which I was wary at first because I have only dealt with UPS and Fedex. However, CEVA provided excellent customer service as they did contact me and I verbally specified a delivery time. Packaging was very efficient, and surprisingly light too!For those who prefer using TV stands, you do have to assemble it on your own. Extremely easy to assemble though! All it took was 9 screws (already in the box) and I recommend using a power-screwdriver. Directions said it required two people, I did it solo! I was just eager to hook up my PS3 via HDMI cable and experience the wonderful world of 1080P.Okay, now for the specifics and why this HDTV deserves a spot in your living room - As I mentioned before, right up to my purchase I extensively followed the quality and price of several HDTVs. The Samsungs 530, 550, 630, 650. The Samsung 630 is the best deal for your money, here's why: The 5 series is less expensive, but only offers refresh times of 60Hz as compared to the 630 which is 120Hz. This is a big difference, and means that your HDTV with 120Hz displays at least twice as many frames-per-second which makes movies, not only sports, very fluid and more realistic. Another difference is the response time, where as the 5 series has a 6ms response time, the 6 series has a 4ms response time. And if you are a gamer, a difference of 2ms can make a big difference. So why the Samsung 630 and not the 650? The only difference now is the contrast ratio. The 630 comes with a 80,000:1 contrast ratio which in my opinion, still creates an extraordinary depth to the display. TV contrast ratio's are starting to become stable around the 70,000 - 100,000 range (or much higher for LEDs). Whereas, 3 years ago the highest was around 10,000 but kept constantly rising. So this HDTV is very much future proof. Yes, the 650 has a higher contrast ratio, but is it worth the extra $200 something dollars?All in all, if you're not worried about price, go all out and purchase a LED HDTV. But if you want to shop smart, this HDTV is the way to go.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pray that it doesn't break......", "Author": "michibilly \"michibilly\"", "ReviewID": "R2DS78QN7CRC9N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Up until two weeks ago, I loved this TV. I upgraded from a 32 inch non-HD/non-flat screen TV.  The picture quality is wonderful, the sound was really good, but I hooked it up to a Yamaha receiver anyway.Here's what happened.  A little over two weeks ago we had been watching the TV, and then left to go outside to do some yard work.  After dinner we decided to watch a movie so I turned on the TV.  Nothing.  Usually when a Samsung TV is off, there is a small red light.  When you turn it on, the picture emerges and the little red light goes off.  No red light.  I unplugged the TV from the power supply and plugged it directly into an outlet (the DVD was on the same power strip and was working).  Then I took the power cord off and went into the kitchen and plugged it into the little Samsung TV in there.  Worked great.  Dang. I pulled out the TV information and the TV was still under warranty.  I called Samsung.After just a few seconds on hold a real person answered and I explained the dead power supply problem.  She told me somebody would call me in three to five working days to arrange for the repair.  WHAT?  Three to five days just to talk to somebody to schedule a repair????  NINE days later somebody finally called and said that my 'ticket' would be sent to troubleshooting.  WHAT?  After nine days, still no appointment for repair????  On day twelve I got a call from a repair guy from a local business contracted to do the repair, and he asked me if the part, the power supply, had come yet.  WHAT?  What part?  I called Samsung again and they gave me the number of GURU, the company they contract to do their repairs, and the company that subcontracts to other local repair services.  I now realize that I'm twice-removed from Samsung and NOBODY is coordinating this repair but ME.I call GURU again after two weeks, and the part has not yet been ordered!!!!!  Two weeks after my initial call and the part isn't ordered yet????  WHY NOT?  Nobody knew why it wasn't ordered by GURU so they immediately blamed Samsung.  Now I'm thinking Samsung is stalling until the warranty runs out, which will happen in about two weeks.  Why in the world would there have to be so many layers of uncoordinated mayhem to do a simple swap of a power supply?  I'm guessing sometime within the next month or two somebody will fix this TV, and I'm guessing it will be about a 15 minute job.When the TV worked we loved it.  The picture quality was great and the sound was pretty good as well.  It has nice features that were pretty easy to figure out and setup.  However, would I buy another one?  Probably not.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding TV for its price range", "Author": "J.R.W", "ReviewID": "RHAE6BO88YPYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picture Quality -  Pros -  The picture on the samsung c630 looks very good right out of the box.  Watching Avatar on Blu-Ray is simply amazing.  Playing PS3 on this TV looks equally amazing and with no noticeable input lag.  I haven't had chance to switch to HD cable programming yet so can't comment on that but standard cable still looks pretty good on this 40 inch tv, a solid 8/10.  Watching standard DVDs through an upconverting 1080p DVD player also look very good.  You can see some graininess if you're within 3 feet or so of the TV but any further than that and the picture looks crisp and clear 9/10.  Blu-Rays just look phenomenal, no other words to describe it really. 10/10.  This TV has plenty of video adjustments to tinker with make the picture suit your taste.  I actually turned the contrast and backlighting down a hair on my set because it was a bit too good.  The TV will also save your picture settings for each input device.  Cons - One of the main reasons I went with the c630 model was for the 120hz capability.  I wasn't really sure how much better the picture quality was with the 120hz over the older 60hz models so I decided I'd be better off safe than sorry.  I can say now that the 120hz feature on the newer model LCDs seems more of a gimmick than anything.  Within the first few hours of watching my new tv I turned off the 120hz and set it back to 60.  This can be done by changing the Auto Motion Plus setting in video options(settings are standard, smooth, clear, custom and off).  The 120hz feature does indeed give the picture a clearer almost 3D like appearance,  however the soap opera effect caused by it unfortunately makes watching movies very distracting.  You feel more like you're watching a live stage show than a film.  It's good for watching sports and some other live broadcasts and events but bad for pretty much everything else.  Another comment i have about this tv is with the viewing angles.  While the picture remains clear even at the widest angles, the colors get a little washed out when viewing from the sides...although not to a huge degree.  Overall the picture looks great from all angles but you will probably notice a slight difference in color saturation depending where you're viewing from.  Color Reproduction overall on this tv is very good.  Colors are accurate, whites look white, blacks look black.  If I had to pick a weakpoint however it would be with the grayscale.  Some grays may appear fuzzy or grainy if you look very closely.  This should be unnoticeable however from normal viewing distance.Features -  Pros - The Media Play and AllShare features are quite nice.  you can plug a flash drive right into your tv and play a variety of video files, mp3s, jpgs with easy to navigate menu's.  Playing files from your PC works in the same way.  You do have to download a file sharing server app from Samsung (it's called PC Share Manager) for it to work but it's fairly straight forward to set up.  You just install the app and choose which files/folders you want the samsung TV to be able to browse on your computer.  Cons - I was unaware of this before purchasing the tv since the product description says you can connect wirelessly to your PC but I have since found out wireless network connection is not built in to this tv.  To connect this tv wirelessly to the internet or to your pc, you need a seperate wireless LAN adapter from Samsung which costs about $60 on Amazon.  So now I either have to purchase another 25 ft of ethernet cable or cough up 60 bucks for the adapter.  Another problem i have with the Media play feature is it can only handle a limited number of files.  I have a 16Gb flash drive with over two thousand mp3s on it but the tv will only read the first 999 of them and the rest cannot be played.  Also for playing music or video files there is no shuffle feature.  You can sort files a number of ways but Samsung left out a random playback ability.Sound -  Pros - Sound on the Samsung c630 is decent although not spectacular.  It's about what I would expect from built in speakers which there is little room for in many of these newer and thinner LCDs. I haven't seen an LCD tv yet that had amazing sound quality right out of the box.  There are plenty of Surround Sound presets and an equalizer to fine tune the audio to your liking.  Cons -  To get the true movie theater experience with this tv, unfortunately you'll have to hook it up to an external home theater system.  Built in speakers are adequate but certainly don't raise the bar for LCDs.  I purchased the Phillips DVD home theater HTS3371D.F7 along with the TV and it sounds spectacular for only $160 extra.Overall - For the $800 range the Samsung C630 seems to offer the best picture along with the most features and 120hz capabilities compared to other sets in the same price range.  The internet capabilities and media player of the C630 are very handy and this set has easy to navigate menus with plenty of audio/visual settings to tweak.  The casing of the TV also looks very sleek and stylish.  The 120hz in my opinion seems like a limited use feature and may not be worth the cost over a 60hz set if you're not also looking to get the additional features many of the newer LCDs have as well.  Although that and most of the other negative comments I had aren't even knocks on this TV set in particular but issues with LCDs in general.  The only true complaint I have with the Samsung C630 is that it requires a seperate adapter to connect wirelessly to the internet which is not what the product description would have you believe.  Some of the features I might be nitpicking about aren't even offered on other tvs in this price range.  Overall, unless you're willing to invest a couple hundred more to make the jump to the new LED backlit LCDs, this is one of the highest quality TVs you'll find for the price.Other notes -  The C630's Energy Saving features allow it to automatically adjust screen brightness to fit room lighting.  Although it's not as energy efficient as the newer LED tv's, the C630 doesn't seem to be generating too much heat.  The box that the Samsung LN40C630 came in was about half the size as the box the for an LG 37\" LCD I had bought my parents the year before.  Not much packing in the box besides styrofoam holders on the top and bottom end of the tv.  Recieved the TV one day prior to estimated delivery with the free super saver shipping.  Was shipped via Pilot Freight and then transferred to another regional freight service which did not show up in tracking information.  I only found out by calling Pilot to try and schedule a delivery time.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Samsung LN40C630, Definitely worth it!", "Author": "Is2r", "ReviewID": "R3SW5S3DW9OVWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For being my first HDTV, I am more than happy with my purchase.  I was debating for months to get the LN40B630, but the price didn't come back down to below $800.  Searching Amazon, I saw this year's model for less than last year's model, so I decided it was time to get one.  I'm more than impressed by what this TV can do: already I have hooked my PS3 and DVD player up to it.  The visuals are absoulutley outstanding -- I feel like I'm actually there.  Reading reviews from last year's model, I saw negative comments about sound quality; this year's model, in my opinion, exceeds expectations. Amazon had this delivered to me in under a week with super saver shipping -- I couldn't ask for better.  Out of the box the stand was easy to install: just slip the TV over the guide stand, screw in, and you're good to go.  Setup up was easy; the only thing I have an issue with so far is that you can't go directly to a different source/input unless the TV is picking up a signal from the device.  Starting up other equipment and then having to select the input again is a bit annoying because you miss the start up unless you leave it on that input.  Not sure if I've calibrated it right though, at this point, it seems fine and looks fantastic with some of the default settings.  The manual isn't very informative in setting most of the options; still being new to HDTV's, I have to look up guides on how to optimize it for different viewing situations. I can't say for sure if this TV is better than all the rest or how it matches up, but side to side at electronic stores it had the best picture in mine and my spouse's opinions.  The Allshare feature is also a nice addition: I am able to stream files from my network devices on to the TV with only having to run an ethernet cord to the router.  In conclusion, I beleive this TV will be more then enough for at least the next 3 years until I consider an upgrade, and I mean a BIGGER upgrade ^.^  Thanks Samsung!", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV, great price!", "Author": "Aggie Anesthesiologist", "ReviewID": "RZ3DNRMAM3OXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"I'm an everyday user, i.e. NOT a technophile. I did some research before buying, but at the end of the day, I wanted something I could enjoy without spending a fortune, and I'm happy with what we got. Some tips on buying your TV, whether this one or another:1) 120 Hz refresh rate -- great for future-proofing, but realize that your cable box may not yet transmit in anything faster than 60 Hz. I don't know if this is different for satellite or antenna transmissions. Also, make sure you buy an appropriate HDMI cable that supports 120 Hz...this should be listed on the package. (Although it may not be needed now, it will be when the cable boxes update again.)2) 1080p -- crystal-clear picture when watching 720p or 1080i programming (nothing on cable is shot in 1080p yet) or 1080p Blu-Ray video. The picture is almost kind of eerie at first, sort of like a soap opera-type appearance, which can be unusual if you're not used to it. I adjusted to it quickly, but it took my wife some time. In the store, ask them to show you something on the airwaves in full HD, or have them run a standard DVD if you think you'll be watching that some via your Blu-Ray player. It is definitely an adjustment.3) Sound -- always a knock on TVs, though for my purposes, it's fine (it's in our living room, not our media room). I really like the \"night\" option for the sound; it keeps the sounds from ebbing-and-flowing as dramatically, i.e. from conversation to a car chase, which is nice when you have kids in bed.4) Computer connectivity -- I have a laptop with HDMI output, so we have connected that the TV and watched something streaming from websites. You can pay extra for \"internet connectivity\" applications like Netflix, Blockbuster, etc., though since we already had that with our Blu-Ray, we didn't duplicate with the TV. The easy computer connectivity is a nice feature.\"", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Jaw dropping picture!!!!", "Author": "1Dub79", "ReviewID": "R2HOJHWKYJEW4C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to Brandsmart, and I was expecting to buy a Sony BRAVIA EX 400 Series 40-Inch LCD TV, Black. The associate told me though it was a 1080p LCD, it was 60hz LCD. Therefore, it would not show as good as an LCD with 120hz. Then, I was looking at the LG 37LH30 37-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV, Gloss Black. It was very reasonable. However, it was a little out-dated. I was then looking at the Samsung. The associate told me it was the top of the line. Of course, I know Samsung is a great brand, though I bought the LG 37LG30 37-Inch 720p LCD HDTV last year because it was cheaper. When I bought that LCD, I knew it would not show as good, but it has been good enough.While making a decision, I found that pixels AND the hertz DOES have an affect on how good an LCD resolution can be. The associate told me the difference between a 60hz and a 120hz LCD is an 120hz shows more of a live picture. This means, there is no blurriness on moving objects, and everything moves increasingly fast, as if in real time. I decided to purchase the Samsung. When I hooked this LCD up, I noticed how sharp the moving objects were. It was unbelievable. All I could say was, \"wow\"! The subjects, and the movements are almost 3-D like. That is the best description, which I can give. While watching some movies, it actually felt as if I was on a live set. I no longer felt as if I was watching actual TV. This is thanks to the 120hz. The picture is one of the most amazing features I have ever seen on a TV, albeit the HD features. Right out of the box, it showed great. I had to make no adjustments. I also noticed how the LCD is user-friendly. Though I am pretty good with gadgets, I don't know what every feature means. At least, every feature has an explanation of what it is at the bottom of the screen. The sound it pretty good, as well. I could not say the same for the LG.For those, who have a PS3 or Xbox 360, the featured Game Mode takes HD gameplay to a whole new level. The graphics, sharpness, sound and movements are enhanced by the 120hz LCD. I highly recommend playing a 1st person shooter, such as Modern Warfare 2. I was playing a Team Deathmatch, and the sound was superb. While playing, I could clearly hear every footstep, which my team, nearby enemies, and I were making. The gunshots sounded increasingly crisp and authentic. The gameplay experience has a lot more to offer on this LCD than playing on my LG. Also, be sure to switch the Game Mode off, prior to watching regular TV!!! If not, the screen will shake lightly per user manual.Also, if you buy the LCD, it will seem as if it does not swivel. However, the LCD actually does. Prior to placing the LCD to the base, look at the base bottom. You will see some screws underneath. Take all, but one of the screws out. This keeps the swivel stand in place. You should now be able to spin the swivel stand. Then, put the same screws back into the base. The LCD will then be able to swivel. Overall, the Samsung is great. It is worth the price. I did not feel bad about spending a little over seven \"big ones\". This is coming from someone, who is frugal, and tight with money.

OMG unless you can do it yourself, think twice about wall mounting your tv!!!  If you are installing this tv on the wall, think too about how you will get to the inputs which are mostly located in the back of the tv, ie home theater, audio and components, as well as extra HDMIs.  You will need to access these inputs from time to time so make sure you have the room to move the tv out and turn it to reach these inputs. That is why we bought an articulating mount.  Still we have to move some furniture out of the way to get at the back of the tv.  Hopefully we will not need to do this often.Con  The shortest power cord in the market I am sure, at most 3 ft.

Unfortunately, the TV was defective in that all images had a reddish tint. I have worked in the high-tech industry long enough to know that sometimes things are defective, so I figured that I would give them a chance to repair or replace it. I called Samsung, and they said that they would send out a service person. About a week later, a technician came out to repair my TV. First of all, he showed up about two hours after the end of the 4-hour window they provided, but even worse, he didn't have the parts required to fix my TV. He claimed that he had ordered them overnight two days before. The strange thing was that I had scheduled the appointment over a week later, so I didn't understand why the parts weren't ordered at that time. He basically said that I was out of luck, and that he would have to come back again.I called Amazon, and they cross-shipped a replacement. The replacement arrived in a few days, and seems to work pretty well.I did get a call about two weeks later from Samsung, telling me that they wanted to schedule an appointment to repair my TV. For a brand new TV, this level of service is unacceptable. If the product weren't so good, I would have sent it back.Despite the poor experience up-front, I have been pretty happy with the TV.

I returned because I wasn't in a rush and decided I wanted a bit larger than 40\" and perhaps wait for a sale or price drop.The television has a stunning HD picture although I thought slightly below that of the 650 model. I was surprised it also played divx movies, .avi, mpeg4, and mkv without a hitch(did not try other formats), by just popping in my external drive via the usb port (there are 2 of them). It was easy to navigate through the files and when playing a movie you can fast forward, reverse, pause, etc. It has a good choice of screen sizing/zooming. For a non-led the TV is also rather thin and light, and the stand was very nice quality and easy to install. CR says the viewing angle was somewhat limited but I thought it was pretty darn good as I could watch it from a very shallow angle with reasonable (but not face-on) picture quality. Sound was pretty good for a flat panel TV but of course not home theater quality.My wife and I were not prepared to see the weird \"soap opera\" effect that I now see many people comment about for LCD TV with 120+ Hz. What I refer to is that the lighting, etc. looks like a tv soap opera, or old \"Dr. who\", maybe like shot on video but also very \"real\" looking like you are right on the set and can tell it is a set. Supposedly if you turn off or turn down the antiblurring it will alleviate this effect. Some people like it but I don't. It may also be that the PQ is so good that you can detect the \"fakeness\" of movie props, makup, etc and some people comment that Hollywood has not caught up to the technology. However we were watching only a 720p version of \"AVATAR\" and even though it was only 720p on a 40\" screen it still looked soap opera-ish and the scratch scars on the military sargeant's head looked totally fake,and when they were inside the helicopter/spacecraft it looked like a scene from \"general hospital\" or \"young and the restless\". At least it made us laugh and thus increased entertainment value! However I didn't know then to try to reduce the motion effect which interpolates frames and inserts them between the actual frames. This seems to be a problem with basically any 120/240hz LCD HDTVs, but I was told if you buy one, try to get a TV that permits you to separately adjust the anti-judder and anti-blur so you can reduce \"soap opera\" without introducing more judder.only other issue was SD channels didn't look so good. It may have been our cable signal but it had a faint \"double image\" next to the image, but then again it may be because I had some sort of motion/image processing on that actually makes SD look worse so I can't blame it on TV. CR rated SD content for this TV \"very good\".Overall a great LCD and a great value. I think factoring in price, Picture quality, features, and physical quality about the best 120hz LCD you can find. If you want slightly better PQ plus some internet options and willing to pay about $150 bucks more then look at the LN40c650 model.

I purchased this LN40C630 for my bedroom and it fits in just right size-wise. After two weeks of use, I have not been disappointed with either the picture or other performance aspects. I set it to Movie Mode and Warm2 Picture Mode, which seem to suit my tastes for natural-looking colors. Unlike my LN52, which is connected to a 5.1 surround audio system in my living room, I am using the on-board speaker system on this LN40 TV. I wasn't sure if I would be happy with the audio quality but it is just fine for my bedroom needs. I even turn up the volume quite a bit when I am using my stationary exercise bike and it works great. My only disappointment audio-wise is the lack of a headphone jack, so I can listen in privacy or not have to turn it up so loud when I exercise. My earlier LN52A750 has this feature but Samsung must have decided to delete this on some newer models. This wasn't a surprise as I researched this before my purchase and still went with Samsung because of my good past experience. The lack of the headphone jack is the only reason I rated this TV 4 stars, as otherwise it is an excellent TV.As far as Amazon's customer service, I couldn't be happier. Both of my Samsung TVs were shipped quickly and arrived in good condition. The smaller LN40C630 was delivered to just inside my front door where I unpacked it and set it up myself, which was no problem at all. Although Samsung's instructions say that it's a two-person job to lift the TV and assemble it to the base, I managed just fine doing it alone. I then moved the TV to my bedroom alone, which was no problem as total weight is about 40 lbs with the base. Any larger TV would probably be too unwieldy to lift and move alone.

I'm gonna try it again and hope for the best, there might be two reviews from me that show up at some point. I am just so happy with this TV that I am going to give it another try.  I spent a lot of time researching different brands that sold 40\" LCD TV's.  I would say the main reason I went with a Samsung is because I have another flat screen Samsung that is still kickin at almost 4 years old. That may not sound like a long time but I bought a Vizio at Best Buy that lasted 13 months, it died one month after the warrenty expired, go figure. My old Samsung is 720p so I wanted to buy a 1080p, 120hz model to see what I was missing.  First let me say that I have purchased many small item from Amazon in the past. This TV (at 749.00) was a big pruchase for me, especially off the internet. Thanks to other reviews from this page I went for it and would do it again. The carrier was a company called Pilot. I was able to select a date and time for delivery. They were there on time, brought the box into my living room, took the TV out, and plugged it in to make sure it worked before they left!  I sat there for a long time reading the instructions and playing with all the settings. After that I watched HD TV, Blu Ray's, PS3 games, football games, even very old movies to see the difference with everything (Blu Ray is out of control)! The 120hz setting is amazing, it makes any Tv show or movie your watching look like a home movie. I can see how this would be distracting but for now I find it facinating. On most things it is overkill, it takes that \"movie\" feel out. Of course you can put the setting very low without turning it off, which I like.  This is a great TV for a GREAT price. I would buy another big item from Amazon since everything went so well.**UPDATE**  I have had this TV for almost a year now and I am still completely satisfied.

This is the newest Samsung engine and much better than the BE2 engine. I not only did a lot of research on this tv but actually spent time watching the ones I was looking to buy. The picture quality of the Samsung is extremely hard to beat at this price range and the Sony didn't even come close. The Samsung also have a better upconvert than the Sony. You can read about hz and contrast ratio all day but it comes down to what you like and what you're willing to spend. For me, this was the nicest looking tv at the best price.

Samsung seems to be a pretty reliable brand, and this TV is no exception. Everything worked out of the box (the TV required some minimal assembly, connecting the display to the stand, but that can be done by a single person). Video quality is very good (as expected), although some people might not like the 120Hz effect (makes non-sports TV shows look 'artificial', for lack of a better term - it's hard to describe without seeing it), or the dynamic backlight (the TV will lower the back-light intensity for 'dark' images to achieve deeper blacks). It's ok though, since both settings can easily be enabled/disabled in the TV's menu.I use the TV for all my video inputs (currently that's just cable, laptop, and Wii), and hooked up a fairly inexpensive external 5.1 receiver powering my surround sound speakers via the digital audio out on the TV. This seemed much easier to me than getting a more expensive receiver with a huge number and variety of inputs (the TV already has plenty for me) and then plugging everything into the receiver, and going from there to the TV. My way, any input on the TV that's currently displayed has it's sound go from the TV to the receiver, and through that, to the speakers. There's no delay between the audio and video that I'm able to discern.Lastly, Amazon's ability to schedule a delivery within a 2-hour window was great - I think most companies give you a much less accurate 8-hour window, which forces you to be home for longer.

The delivery guys were even able to install and test the TV for me before they left. Was perfect (I think that is an amazon prime facility though).Having said that, I must say that the first couple days I owned this I was in a slump. The picture clarity was so insanely real that it felt like I was a part of the movie or the scene. For example when Arnold Schwaz. flipped around with his shot gun in terminator I had to dart behind my IKEA sofa for safety. I might not have conveyed the right message in the above 2 lines but the clarity had a sense of unwanted realisticity to it. The scenes and people in the scenes looked like out of a documentary and did not have the \"flare\", if I might say so, of a movie - \"The movie effect\" you would get in a theater. Howvere, on a quick online search and enquiries at Best Buy and Walmart I learnt that I was not the first to experience this. I got into a painstaking effort of rectifying this and had to dig into the myriad of options the TV had (as recommended step by step in a webpage) before things began to look better. Not sure what I did in the end of the day but the picture clarity is just fine now and my wife and I have no complaints any more. Terminator and recently Avatar on Blu-Ray as well was insanity unleashed.Gud Luck choosing. I would recommend Samsung and the LN40C630 for sure.Update - 10/19/2011: In further exploring into the TV functionalities, one disappointment I have come across is the fact that the TV is not compatible with Samsung Apps. Therefore, you cannot browse the net on the TV and primarily cannot watch Youtube or Amazon Prime videos over the wireless (which is what is killing me). I have to use a PC-TV connection cable to display PC contents onto TV. It took me hours of exploring to figure out how to share my laptop local hard-disk content with the TV over a wireless network.

The price was almost half what I paid for the Vizio and with a 120Hz refresh rate it is a very good bargain.  The only slightly negative comment I have is that the onboard sound is not as good as the Vizio.  Having learned my lesson the hard way, I purchased the 4-year Square Trade Warranty offered by Amazon.  It was only 80 something dollars and I easily justified it to myself since the cost of the TV at Amazon was $50 dollars cheaper than anywhere else I could find it!  I highly recommend this additional purchase.  It's cheap insurance..just in case this TV does not age well.  Finally, I have to comment about the shipping.  I opted for normal delivery and though it took a couple of weeks for me to get the unit (I think it was back-ordered) the company in my area that delivered it was outstanding.

This thing blows the old style tv's away!  So maybe the big leap weighs my review higher than if I went from a 5 year old LCD to this LCD.The picture is perfectly clear, I only get OTA (over the air) signals.  No overpriced cable for me.  I live in Dallas, so there are over 30 channels, half of them hispanic, religious or product sales, so I get to watch around 15 channels that have regular shows.  The HD channels are awesome on this tv.The screen is very bright and clear.  I was considering the Sony Bravia EX500 - 700 series.  The 500 is in the same price range as the LN630.  The Samsung has better colors to me.  More vibrant with deeper contrast.  The Sony's have muted colors that some say are more realistic.  I like the more vibrant colors so the Samsung won me over even though the Sony has more features; like the internet apps.  This screen is also a matte screen which is what I was looking for.  It is in our living room with 4 very big south facing windows, so glare is a big problem and this really helps.  Don't let the sale people tell you matte doesn't matter and that glossy gives you a better picture.  Under ideal conditions, in a windowless jail cell, they are correct.  The glossy screens do give you a more vibrant and brighter picture, but in the real world of rooms with windows the matte definitely reduces the glare by 50%.  If you can't see the picture the quality doesn't really matter.I'm glad I didn't cave in to the internet features of other higher priced tv's, because they are very limited except for the very new Sony TV with Google TV.  Of course you have to pay a bit more.  There are other ways to get internet on this tv via, blu-ray, laptop, internet boxes, etc. for around $300 or less.The sound is adequate.  I have SD speakers set up, so I have the option to get very good sound at anytime.  I only use my theater system for movies and live sports.  Regular shows and news, these speakers are just fine.Plenty of connectivity; HDMI, composite, USB, ethernet.  If you really need more, then you need to get an AV receiver.  You'd fit the profile of a person needing an AV receiver.Basic setup is pretty straight forward.  Other people have posted their setup specs, which are a good starting point.  One thing I will mention is that I got this tv for the 120hz refresh rate so motion blur would be less noticeable, especially for football.  The best setting is - Auto Motion Plus 120HZ: CLEAR.  Otherwise you get the 'soap opera' effect, which is really weird that Samsung thinks anyone would want that look???  I see no motion blur watching football like the older LCD tv's.  So this is a winner in this category.Ethernet setup was a little more difficult.  I have my PC and router hardwired with CAT6 cable to the tv, getting the tv to see the router took some trial and error.  The auto detect did not work the first time, so I got all the router info and manually set it up... and got a connection error.  Finally I tried the auto set up again and it connected this time.  Why it didn't see the router the first time is beyond me.  But I now can use this tv to show all my photos and home movies to friends and family.  Goodbye projector slide shows, and crowding around a 20\" PC monitor !  You can also watch movies from the PC, but I don't do that because of the time it takes to format the movies and the space they take up on my hard drive.This is a more basic model, and the price reflects that, especially a very good sale price.  More expensive tv's have more features, but for the picture quality, this can't be beat.  Also the more basic the tv, the more future proof it is, since the next gadget won't make what few gadgets this tv has obsolete so quickly.  Google tv has already made the previous Sony app and Samsung app tv's dinosaurs.  And 3D tv?  they just came out and now I hear they are already working on 3D tv's without the need for glasses.The only real Con I have is that the IR sensor is to the extreme lower right corner of the tv.  I think most people are like me in that we point the remote to the center of the tv.  Often it doesn't pick up the IR signal if quickly pointed randomly to the center.Finally I checked into the Samsung capacitor problems the '06-'08 tv's were having.  Samsung told me that they had corrected that failure in the '09 models so the 2010 models are clear of that problem.  Incase you didn't know about the capacitor issue, what Samsung did was under engineer their capacitors to the point where after a year or so of use they would burn out and you'd end up with a nice black rectangular mirror.  Often after the one year warranty, so the buyer was SOL.  It's an easy fix for an electrician, but who buys a $1000 tv to last one year?  And how many of us are electricians?  You might want to do some research to clear your mind of this Samsung problem, because it spanned all their tv lines.This tv rocks for sports, everyday use and especially because you get more bang for the buck !****update June4, 2011****I have started to move all my movies from DVD to mp4 on an external hard drive (see my iomega ego 2tb review).  Man it's nice to get rid of the DVD's.  Mp4's are 1-2gb in size and the picture quality is about the same.  I cannot notice a difference.  I just plug in the iomega hdd via usb and use the samsung tv remote to find my movie and watch!  could not be easier.  Sound is also theater surround just like the DVD.  I plan on getting another HDD and getting rid of our 8yr old 5 DVD disc changer.DNLA also works like a charm.  I use the Samsung PC Share Manager program and can easily watch photos or movies from my computer.  Although there are some flaws with the samsung pc share manager.  The most glaring is that photos are displayed in a random order, not in the order as you see on your hard drive, WTH?!?!?!  So vacation slide are shown skipping all over the vacation time period?!?!  that make no sense.  It seems as if the program is a high school student's science project.To get around the randomness of the photo order, I have to use the plain DNLA connction, but that sometimes distorts the photos when they go from landscape to portrait.  the following photo is stretched to landscape when it should be portrait.

Delivery was quicker than I expected and the driver set up the TV (I requested the set up to check for damage and to make sure it was not DOA). Five stars as usual for Amazon.Now for the TV...I have waited 6 months to review this TV because I wanted to make sure that I was satisfied. No regrets! I was debating between the similar Sony (40ex500) and this Samsung LN40c630. I am a Sony man and to be honest the Samsung won because of the amazon price at the time and the offer for 24 months no interest financing.I could not be happier with my decision. The TV is beautiful. The Picture is excellent in HD and Bluray and standard definition is OK but I don't attribute that to the TV. The Menu is easy to understand and settings are plentiful. 40 inches is perfect for my sitting distance (about 8 feet). I know a few people complain about the sound but for me it is fine, I do have a stereo receiver that I have the TV connected to but I only use it for listening to music channels, for regular viewing the TV speakers are perfect for me. I have had the TV for 6 months now and I have not had one problem with and don't expect to have any at all because everything seems solid and reliable. If by some chance there comes a problem I will let you know.To those doing research on LCDs...I researched and debated for a year before making this purchase and as stated before I have no regrets.

I have been very happy with my Samsung LN40C630 until 2 weeks ago. The panel started going out (panel version code - AAO1). It randomly gets dark and sometimes it seems to have a ghostly white film over the screen and other times the colors bleed all over the screen. Upon further inspection I discovered that it also had what some call jailbars running up and down the screen. I was very surprised because I have always considered Samsung a reliable company. I expect a TV to last longer than 3 years no matter what kind it is (LCD, LED, Plasma). I have a Sony (Tube version) from 10 years ago and it still plays perfectly. The LCDs may not last as long as that but 3 years...give me a break.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very nice TV", "Author": "Jenny Cook", "ReviewID": "RAHTIT5IR1K2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this one recently.

Not all HDTV's come with a swivel base. It was a little bit more but the reports were very good. I was always taught you get what you pay for. Went to a few stores and priced a few sets. Amazon had the best price but I was concerned about having a TV shipped. I never bought anything from Amazon before. I was so impressed when I read that when ordered what time period and day I wanted it delivered. I ordered on a Sunday and chose to be delivered on Thurday between 10-1pm. I was able to track the package. Then I got a call at 10:15 on Thursday and the driver said he was in the neighborhood and will be there shortly. I walked out on my terrace to have a smoke and they drove up in 3 minutes. I checked the package and model number and told them I was impressed with the service. I hooked it up shortly thereafter and was very pleased. I would reccomend the TV but I should have gone a little bigger but I had a budget.

I researched TVs for quite some time before settling on . . . . a Panasonic Plasma.  Then I went to Best Buy and looked at televisions for a half an hour.  Then I went to Walmart.  Then I went to Target.  After all that time just staring at screens (and killing more than a few brain cells in the process), I landed on this baby.  Amazon had a deal I just couldn't pass up so I jumped into the brave new world of Hi Def.  After 8 months of football games in HD, video games, and lots of Netflix, I can honestly say this is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  Everyone in the TV realm talks about \"blacks\" and I find the \"blacks\" to be very \"black\" in this television.  Overall, the colors are great - very saturated.  The picture quality is crystal clear.  Seriously, I feel like I'm at the game.  Or killing zombies.  You know, depends on the day.The biggie in this TV is the 120hz.  Now, for the price difference of something like 60 bucks, they upgraded the model from 60 hz to 120 hz and it shows.  It doesn't show all the time, but when it does, it shows.  Panning through a Bluray feels much smoother.  Overall, the entire movie-watching, team-rooting, castle-storming experience is fantastic with this TV.  And as a bonus - I moved in the last 8 months and the TV made it through the move just fine, wrapped in a blanket.

However, I would still consider it heavy so don't try to do it yourself if you think you're gonna drop it.Adding the base was simple and hooking it up to my AT&T; uverse and surround speakers took me all of about 20 minutes and that's with having to run cords through the back of my TV stand, etc.As for the actual quality of the picture and sound.  I am extremely happy with picture quality; I adjusted the different settings to get the right fit for the room/lighting, but now it's perfect.  Every one is going to want to adjust their picture to their own liking--it really does depend on how your room is lit, where you sit in relation to the screen, and just your personal preference.  Sound quality is pretty good for an internal speaker--I would rate it better than most TVs in the same range of quality/price.  However, I already had external speakers with my last TV so I hooked them up.  I did use the internal speakers when playing music from a USB and I was happy with what I heard.Overall, this TV is a huge deal for what I paid ($568.00).  Free Shipping is a plus.

I had been watching LCD tv pricing for awhile and finally made the buy decision for this Christmas holiday.  Despite the Samsung's larger screen, the room feels larger again with the huge cathode ray HDTV absent.These are my subjective observations about the Samsung LCD TV:Physical Appearance.  It is just as handsome in the home as it is in the store.Ease of Setup.  The TV is basically plug and play.  For those not satisfied with the generic setup, the settings menu provides a large number of items to tweak.HD picture quality.  The clarity is amazing.  Only two things to mention.  One, you will probably want to calibrate the display to your own preferences (Google helps).  Two, you will also probably want to pair it with a PS3 or other suitable means of providing an HD signal to the TV to enjoy the full capabilities of the screen.Sound quality.  The sound is great for a TV, but for those expecting a cinema experience you may want to add an external sound system.Remote ease of use.  The remote gets the job done and is easy to use.  The TV takes a few seconds to boot up and turn on, you only need to press the power button once.  =)I preferred the SAMSUNG 40\" LED LCD TV because it seemed very crisp and sharp in the store while their LCD TV did not seem as bright.  But I am now content with the LCD TV after having it in the home and putting it through its different modes of operation.HD movies are amazing to watch on this TV.

When Amazon had this TV for $650.00 with free delivery, I finally jumped.  I have had my eye on Samsung TVs for quite awhile.  Most reviews I've read have been positive for the Samsung brand, and so far I've been very satisfied.PROs:-Great crisp video quality!!  Graphics pop and even smaller text is easy to read.-VGA input is an awesome feature.  I like to play computer games from time to time and also do some video editing on occasion.  Hooking my computer up to the monitor was simple and increases my workspace.  And playing games on the larger screen was amazing.-The USB ports are a nice touch. I only wish that the TV would have audio outputs, so that any music or video accessed through USB could be directed through my surround sound.  But it is nice way to listen to all your mp3s.  It's almost like a giant mp3 player!-Easy to assemble and set up.  Back in the day of massive CRTs and even more cumbersome giant projection units a 40\" Television would have required a couple of big guys to muscle it into position.  I was able to unpack, assemble the stand and lift it up onto my television stand entirely on my own, without incident.  It was harder getting rid of the 32'' CRT that was there before.CONs-While this TV allows you to adjust display settings to the most minute detail, it was a bit daunting getting through all the settings.  I found some of the online user comments extremely helpful in getting the display to look great.  It does take some tweaking.  I originally had some judder issues and frame jumping.  (Turns out it was the 120 Hz True Motion settings...they needed to be turned into \"off or clear\" mode to get rid of the judder)-120 Hz True Motion....I could be wrong here, but at this time I think that it may almost be unnecessary. Almost every source I've connected to the TV only inputs at 60 Hz.  Which is why having true motion turned on caused issues with judder. Perhaps some gaming consoles output at 120 hz???  I'm not sure.  Again, I could be wrong about that.  I had the impression that using 120 hz would improve the clarity and sharpness of images in motion.  With my current settings at \"clear\" it appears to be un-utilized.  Longterm, however, I could see sources catching up to the 120 hz output, so I won't need to get a new set when that happens.  So perhaps it's an investment in the future.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this TV.  The Pros far outweigh the cons.

I wound up going with the 40\" 120hz from Samsung with the hope that the higher refresh rate would make the picture unbeatable.Many people have noticed that the 120hz TVs from Samsung make the picture look like it was filmed with a camcorder, or look like soap-opera video quality, which is not all that desirable.  It turns out that this is really because of a technology that Samsung uses to \"upconvert\" form the 60hz broadcasts of digital cable and DVDs to 120hz.  This is the Auto Motion Plus feature.  Turning it off makes the picture look normal, and slightly enhanced from a 60hz TV.  There sometimes is a \"choppy\" look, but this is most likely just how a \"lower quality\" signal looks on a \"higher quality\" display, sort of like how standard definition video looks awful on a high definition TV.  However, the picture looks great, and there is no blur, as well as there being vivid colors.So what's the point of 120hz?  Well, essentially you are \"future-proofing\" your TV, since television and Bluray discs will most likely broadcast at the higher rate within the next few years, and that will undoubtedly look incredible on a 120hz TV.My recommendation?

If you want a quality, top rated 40\"-42\" TV for between $700-$800, this is the one to get. This Samsung TV replaces a 3 year old 37\" 720P Sharp Aquos that was excellent for it's day but doesn't come close to this 40\" Samsung. The clarity of the 1080p 120Hz vs the 720p 60Hz of the Sharp is like night and day. I looked at it in the store next to a 40\" 1080p 120Hz Samsung LED TV and could not tell the difference. Honestly, the clarity is so dramatic it takes a little getting used to.The only problem I had was getting the TV on the stand. The directions are poor and it took a friend who also has a Samsung to show me what I was doing wrong. If you have the same problem, be aware that the TV actually slides ONTO the base, it does not sit against the vertical section of the L bracket. If you do that you won't be able to get the screw holes to line up.I am loving this TV. I had rented Sherlock Homes in HD and it was the first movie I viewed on this TV...I was blown away by the detail. Everyone has their own personal preferences for the settings but the Dynamic option is awsome for everyday viewing.I highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice mid level hdtv", "Author": "andy", "ReviewID": "R458CD9Z6TIP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have had our Sammy now for just over a month. The good: black levels are deep--comparable to that of a low-end plasma, the factory corrective electronics do a nice job cleaning up bad TV signals, the adjustments are infinitely flexible--and simultaneously maddening if you are in any way OCD about visual picture quality, it has a slender frame for its picture size, the fit and finish of the TV are visually appealing, judder is kept to a minimum for the most part--except on a few, old slow-panning scenes. The bad: I have one stuck pixel--red, and it drives me slightly crazy...and it will not go away. I understand that you need a min. of 5 such pixels for them to consider it a defective display. Also, the sound is not so good. Please plug this TV into a good surround system to do it justice. The 2x10w speakers are tinny and somewhat harsh sounding. The display will tell you that it is operating at 60 HZ, but this is a misnomer. Your input is coming in at 60 HZ, but your display is still operating at 120 Hz...if that makes any sense.

You are only a few tweaks away from an excellent picture.This review is only about first day setup and viewing; I've only had the set 3 days so anything else is premature.The first evening I felt I had made a terrible mistake or had a lemon.  I have a Playstation 3 and expected it could only be a better experience than it was when played on the 2.5 year old 26\" LG entry level I replaced. If there were shadows, the screen became virtually unviewable; if the character passed a window with sunlight comine in, the whole screen would flash brightly.I went through the user manual - I am comfortable with electronics, but the information in the manual is very poorly written with little practical instruction; for example, there was a brief mention of a game mode (the comments about using the game mode indicated diminishment in the quuality of the image, the image shaking... based on all that negative information why would they even have a game mode?)  Further, I could not even find the game mode option (when directed to it by tech support the following morning, it was not an intuitive path at all).The next morning technical support was fairly helpful, after first suggesting setting up a service call before offering any information  - the fix to the screen blacking out in shadows was very simple: turn off the \"EcoSmart\" (there is a case of over kill: having the power consumption change second to second is one of those features that I am sure CNET will say to ignore.So, after experimenting with various settings adjustments the picture looks good, and I can get evening lighting in a game. I'm not done trying to optimize the picture, but a bit at a time.  I am comfortable with the purchase now.As I said, I wouldn't review anything I just bought, but the fact the default settings are not optimal and that the owner manual is really subpar robbed me of the pleasure of a new upgraded television.On balance, I am really pleased by the high sound quality from the built in speakers.  I am confident the major problems are far-less-than-optimal presets,and a user manual that should be a major cause of embarrassment to Samsung.It doesn't even include the specs; that first night I was questioning if it really was 120 refresh - Playstation was the only screen that showed rates, and that was 60!", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Died Shortly after Arrival", "Author": "J.D.H", "ReviewID": "R2XAWZSFGDFVLH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After carefully setting up this brand new Samsung LN40C630 TV it died after 10 minutes of first use.

The picture is a vast improvement over my old 32 inch Samsung, acquired in early 07 for more than double the cost. This model also boasts what I consider almost astoundingly good sound. Coupled with an Insignia internet blu-ray player, the sound of Pandora on here is better than with any dvd and almost good enough as not to require any type of external speakers. I am not sure why this is, but the sound is many times better than on my older Samsung tv. I have not even fiddled with the display controls yet, and am perfectly satisfied with how this tv looks. The multitude of display options is mind-boggling. Most of the normal dvds that I watch are in 720p, so they do not even take advantage of the tv's 1080p capacities. As far as the 120hz feature, I'm sure that makes a difference, too, but I am not qualified to judge it over the older 60hz models. It does look good.

Both worked fantastically. The picture is great, the sound is fantastic. In order to use the TV with the sound bar, you set the TV (under Sound -> Speaker Select) to use \"External Speaker\". Once you do this, however, every time you change the volume it says \"Not Available\" in a decent-sized gray box in the MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN. This box stays there for a couple seconds (more if you press the button a couple times). This is horrible. If the movie gets intense and you want to change the volume, you get an error message right in the middle of the screen EVERY SINGLE time you change the volume. Everyone in the room goes, \"Hey! What happened? Why can't we see what's happening?\".I called technical support and patiently explained my problem to them. They indicated this was a feature, not a bug, and that they would not be offering any way to disable this in the future. They suggested I just use two different remotes - one for the TV, one for the sound. Which is not, in my view, an option. Sure it's technically possible, but I got both products from Samsung specifically so that I wouldn't have to dp that - so they'd be compatible. I love Samsung products (I own an Epic among other products) and I love both of these products individually, but am returning them because this is so glaring a user interface error that I cannot live with it.

This is honestly the best one I have owned to date. Samsung continues to impress me with their line of televisions. The 120 hertz refresh rate makes the picture quality incredible smooth and the picture is so sharp and clear that I actually feel like the people on the screen are sitting right in front of me. The hint of grey is also a nice touch in my living room and should work well with just about any set-up. Very easy to install. Has several USB ports and has the same audio jack that your computer has so you can plug in a set of speakers if you want. The sound is the only thing that is a little underperforming. But it's nothing that a decent set of speakers can't fix.

I think Samsung makes the best LCDs & LEDs out there is terms of picture quality and TV set designs.I took a chance and ordered a Used edition from Amazon Warehouse that was listed in very good condition and saved about $100 off new price. With my Amazon Prime account 1-Day shipping was only $4.99. Brilliant!The TV came UPS and the box was brand new, there was a fist-sized hole punctured in the back of the box and my heart sank. When I opened it up there was not a single scratch anywhere on the unit, infact there was no sign that anyone had ever touched this TV before. Must've been cosmetic packaging damage. Feeling better about buying a like new used LCD TV through the mail!This set looks great! It took about 5min to set the TV on the stand and screw in the bolts holding it in place. This TV is LIGHT! My old 32\" tv weighed almost 80lbs, this set is about 30lbs.I have a PS3, 360, Wii, Cable TV, and Computer hooked into this thing and all them look great. I run my computer through a DVI => HDMI cable and it displays in perfect resolution, Hulu looks great! Game mode did seem to help my game session with some BlOps on PS3, did seem to improve initial controller lag.Games look great, movies look great, Blu-Ray looks awesome. I watched some Planet Earth and was blown away. My old set was an HD, but this is like looking a real HD set. Very nice black levels.I didn't play around with the settings too much, but for me the Dynamic picture setting was brightest and most vibrant. I do have what after researching on AVS forums the lower end display chip, but I haven't any issues after the 1st week. I will update this review if anything goes pear-shaped.Some people may not think the speaker are good, but I don't turn them past 20 and they are loud as hell. When watching something while going to sleep I have to turn it down to around 7 to not be too loud in the house. So speakers are really nice for built it units. They actually sound better than my 10yr old micro-speaker 5.1 system.Well thats it. Good TV, get the bigger version if you can afford it, or hell get some LED action if you can afford that, but this is an amazing buy for those looking for a great TV for a great price.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Why LG may be a better choice than Samsung!", "Author": "Internet shopper \"Retired but not tired!\"", "ReviewID": "R3QH6ID53UZ0AG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This brief review compares certain features of the LG 42LD550 with Samsung LN40C630.These features applies to all sizes of the LG LD550 series and the Samsung C630 series.I had the opportunity to test both TV sets side by side (See Technical Problem below).IN GENERAL- First of all the pictures on both TVs are outstanding.- I did not notice any imperfections in the LCD display on either set.- The base on the Samsung is of superior quality and very rigid whereas the LG model is a bit flimsy (this is irrelevant if you mount the TV on the wall).- The remote controls are comparable however the Samsung has built-in light and the LG does not.- The LG's price tag was $78 higher than the Samsung however the screen on the LG is two inches bigger and the LG has more features (details below)TECHNICAL PROBLEMOne of my objectives was to view MP4 video from a USB hard drive and from USB memory sticks.The Samsung would play part of the MP4 movies and suddenly stop then skip to the next movie when playing from either the stick or the hard drive.It would play 1 hour 25 minutes and 43 seconds of two of the movies and only 24 minutes of a third movie.I tried a 30 Gb and 8 Gb formatted with NTFS and FAT32 respectively.Yes, I verified that the latest software/firmware was installed by connecting the TV to the internet via the Ethernet port.I tried both USB ports but the problem remained.SAMSUNG \"TECHNICAL SERVICE\"The Samsung customer service rep explained \"that this TV model was not designed to play full MP4 movies, only short clips\".She offered to schedule a service visit but made it very clear that they would charge me for a service visit if they did not find a problem with their hardware.I talked to two representatives and finally asked to talk with a technical service rep. They promised me that he would call me back within 24 hours.I eventually gave up waiting, returned the TV and ordered the LG for an additional $78 instead.Nobody from Samsung has ever called me back (it has now been weeks).WHY LG MAY BE A BETTER CHOICEThe LG model has no problems playing my MP4 videos. It plays from my 1 TB hard drive and any USB memory stick (FAT32 or NTFS format).It will even play M4V video which is Apple's file extension for MP4 containers.Here is the best part!Apart from the extra 2 inches (screen size) the LG model offers:1) Netcast, providing direct access to online viewing of Netflix, YouTube, Yahoo weather (and others).2) Free Nero MediaHome 4 CD opening up for Digital Living (DLNA) capability allowing you to access wired or wireless computers or other networked devices throughout your home to the TV.NETCASTUsing the Netcast feature, I no longer have to have my laptop PC connected to the TV to watch NETFLIX and it appears that the picture and sound quality is better than via a connected PC. Also I like to be able to select, start/stop and pause the movies from the LG remote.The TV has the RGB and stereo mini plug for a PC in case you still want to hook one up.I connected the TV to my home network by wire because I like the \"wired\" Ethernet speed and reliability (wireless is also available - see other reviews for details).NETFLIX was very easy to set up. Simply push the Netcast button on the LG remote, click on the Netflix icon. Enter the code displayed on the TV on your PC and you can start watching Netflix movies (obviously you must have a Netflix account or sign up for one). For only $8 per month you can watch unlimited movies without commercials. (I have come to realize that life is too short to spend part of watching TV commercials).DLNA (Digital Living Network Association)Installing Nero on my computers allows the TV to access any drive on my network. From the LG remote I can browse all Music, Video and Family pictures stored anywhere on our home network (Nero requires you to allow access to the specific folders before the TV is allowed access).The LG rep informed me that TVersity software (free) will also work as an alternative to Nero (I have not tried it yet).INITIAL SETUPThe initial setup was equally easy for both brands. The Samsung software/firmware was up to date. It took a short while for the LG to update from version 06.01.05 to 08.02.16 which may be because LG issues updates when new Netcast services comes online.The initial channel lineup was easier to manage on the Samsung.LG CUSTOMER SERVICEThe TV arrived without the Nero CD.I therefore called LG customer service. They told me that they may not be able to ship the missing CD. Instead they suggested I download the trial version from Nero.I therefore contacted Amazon Customer Service and they instructed LG to send me the CD. LG has confirmed that it \"is in the mail\".I am still waiting for the CD (at the time of this writing).I am currently using the Nero trial version which does not support MP4!!!CONCLUSION$78 extra for the LG TV provides a lot of additional functionality and 2 inches extra.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I don't regret the buy!", "Author": "MrRuiz LXIX", "ReviewID": "RR9PTKQBOCZ7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to share a quick review but more than that a experience of this itemand for all you out there looking for a nice tv and great pricelet me tell you what I went through to find the right oneI bought the LG 42LD520 at Walmart and this Tv look really nice and all the feature were cool but came defective  and it was too big for my setting,  didnt like that and took backthen I ordered the  LG 37LE5300 this tv is amazing if you are gonna hook it up to a Home theatre but if you are notthen dont get it! speaker are too little and dont sound good and if you are a gamer you wont love itI sent it back and order this samsung 40\" 1080p 120  gotta tell you this tv fit my needs and my room like the way I dreamed of  I cant tell how happy I feel with every single detail since I opened it I couldnt stop saying .. waoo look this waoo look that.I use this tv as Monitor/ps3/netflix and all work greatnow I dont get into detail like picture setting and all that because there are many reviews of it .I just wanted to tell you that if you are looking for a tv and you are between Lg.visio and Samsungthis samsung is the best choice for the price and the look is way better than Sony x400 , vizio lg and the others.I took some pictures of the setting and you can check them out at the customer picturegood luck !", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "No internet or apps", "Author": "William G.

The first LCD that was delivered had an apparent power supply problem, as the TV would randomly turn itself off and refuse to turn back on, unless left unplugged for hours. Amazon quickly shipped a replacement, free of charge, and this replacement has worked flawlessly ever since.I love everything about this TV, but especially the vivid color (in standard mode), automatic brightness adjustment to save eyes and energy, the great built-in audio, the usbkey media support, and the clean look of both the LCD and even its stand.A few minor complaints (in order of annoyance):1) I can't use the Samsung Remote control android app with this TV because the Samsung LN40C630 doesn't have the \"Internet@TV\" feature that 650 series and above have. Should've bought it instead.2) 120Hz video smoothing looks like crap, so I've disabled it, HOWEVER, that setting appears to be ignored when playing content off a usbkey(!!!), so movies still have that 'homevideo' smoothed look.3) There's a known problem with playing 720p h264 MKV video files from a usbkey, where the audio is always out of sync by a few milliseconds. Still hasn't been fixed by a firmware update (but hey, most TVs can't play MKV video at all).4) It takes a looong time for this TV to turn on (what seems like 10 seconds), but hopefully that's a good tradeoff for saving power (haven't yet hooked my kill-a-watt meter up to see how much phantom power it's using when 'off').5) DLNA still isn't very compatible (especially with linux servers), so I'm not using it. Using usbkey sneakernet instead.6) The TV supports ext3fs formatted usbkeys, but not ext2, or ext4 (which is needed for playing back files larger than the FAT 4GB limit).", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tv", "Author": "S.

I was mainly looking at soundbar reviews. From Samsung to Sony. There wasn't a simple solution, each product had one little or major concern. From glitches to too much bulky equipment.I already have a great radio with rich sound. The Cambridge Works I765. I was wondering if it were possible to hook this up to my TV. After a little research I purchased a 6 ft audio cable (3.5mm male to 3.5 male). I plugged one end into the TV's audio out and the other end into the radio's Aux. Bingo! Great sound for all programs, whether they be Roku, Blue Ray, or regular TV.I can have the TV's sound and the radio's sound on together. I have the radio's sound set at 10 and the TV's at 22. The blend is perfect. The radio does a great job clearing up muddy dialogue and the bass is terrific. It's not surround sound but it was a simple solution with very satisfying results.Thus if you already have a radio with great sound, try this out and save yourself a few hundred dollars.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "LCD Love", "Author": "KB", "ReviewID": "R2UFJJILIU77NZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did about 3 months of research before purchasing this tv.

I don't have a very big living room, so it works very well for me. But if you have a stereo system this doesn't matterThe appearance: Pretty sleek looking TV. Not as thin as some of the high end models, but At this price point, it's as good looking of a set as I found.Features: I'm not one to use the TV to get online...so this doesn't matter nearly as much to me.

Removing the Samsung LCD TV from the box and set up was a breeze. The hardest part was removing my old 38\" cathode tube tv that weigh well over 80 lbs.This Samsung TV is beautiful and classy looking and was definetely wife approval with all the necessary features for her and myself.  My first week of use with this Samsung tv was fairly good with a little blurring during fast actions and without the HD signal. The following week I had upgraded to the HD signal and here is where the LCD TV performed to what its designed to do. The color, detailing and action is top notch! I used recommended setting that a amazon reviewer poster had listed with a couple of my own changes. I found that all LCD have a little blurring during fast action even at 4 ms respond time, but the more you use the tv the more the blurring smooth out. The one itch I have is only when using the Directv remote, you have to press the on button twice to get the Samsung TV to turn on and repeatly press the volume to increase the sound. After 30 days of use, I really enjoy viewing with my Samsung LCD tv that I have decided to protect with investment with a 3 year warranty from Amazon as well.

I will be updating this review as things unfold because I want to be fair.  This is the first TV I've had in over 15 years so I'm no expert on TVs, but I am pretty tech savvy. Right out of the box I had a problem. The instructions said to assemble the stand first, so I did.  Then when I tried to set the TV on the stand the screw holes would not line up.  Long story short, they shipped it with the wrong part.  I called Samsung and the first service rep told me the part was on nationwide back order and wouldn't even guess how long it would take to ship.  When I get a red flag like that I usually rethink my purchase; I mean it seems clear to me that they deliberately shipped it with the wrong part.  So I thought about it awhile and called back, this time the rep said the part was not on back order and should ship in 7-10 days.  One of them has to be wrong.  I ordered the correct guide stand.  I managed to get temporary use of another mount in order to make sure the thing actually worked.  So I set it up and turned it on and installed theSamsung  WIS09ABGN LinkStick Wireless LAN Adapter (purchased separately).  After some time I got it to link to my home network, but with an error message saying there was a problem with my service provider, Bellsouth. I called BS and they wanted $29 for an \"Advanced Technical Support Issue.\"  I declined. I haven't got a dvd player yet and I don't have cable so I don't really know if the thing works or not.  I'll be contacting Samsung for help with the Wifi.  I'll let you know how that goes.Update 12/19/2012.  No problems at all so far. This has been a long time coming but I got the stand issue taken care of at no additional cost. Kudos to Samsung. Bought a Samsung Blu-Ray DVD player and with wireless LAN adapter the DVD player found my home network easily and has not really hiccupped since.  The picture is great, especially with Blu-Ray discs or streaming HD from my Mac. (I also got an HDMI cable so I now have a 40\" monitor)  Some old tv shows when streamed look grainy, but that is not the fault of the TV.

Football is set up where normally the camera isn't panning much, or at least the player you are looking at stays in the same position on the screen, and this TV works pretty well for that.  And a freeze frame looks great.On blu-rays it's a different story.  I don't know if it's because blu-rays (and all movies) are shot at 24 frames/second so maybe the 120 HZ doesn't help, but on blu-rays, there is an awful amount of ghosting any time the camera pans.  It gets so bad that it actually occasionally makes me a little sick to my stomach.  It honestly makes me think that it might be better to watch movies on my low def CRT I used to have.  I've never had another LCD to compare it to, but if you are getting an HDTV to watch blu-rays on, you really need to get a much more expensive one that doesn't have the ghosting issues (if there is one) or go plasma maybe.

Before purchasing, google \"Samsung flicker\" or \"Samsung capacitors\" (in each case, without the quotes). There is a lot of information on the Internet indicating that Samsung's off-shore manufacturers have used faulty capacitors in their unit power supply--apparently this problem affects both Samsung TV's and monitors. When this happens, you will not notice anything wrong at first, as it takes the capacitors time to fail (google \"capacitor plague\") but when they start failing you will experience flickering and dimness at first and can expect this to get worse over time and for the unit to finally completely fail.If you are lucky, you will have problems while the unit is still under warranty. However, the replacement unit you receive may have the same problems, and when it fails will almost certainly be out of warranty.My experience: Samsung replaced my unit on warranty, but the replacement unit they sent me failed (with the issues described) shortly afterwards and was \"out of warranty.\" While I didn't expect much I did call Samsung customer service to see if they had any program to address this. They do not. Once the warranty is over, you're on your own. At the price they quoted it really isn't worth fixing it, so it looks like I'm stuck with a very expensive paperweight.

In comparison this set has more contrast, color control and runs at 120hz verses the 60hz of my series 5. These along with a much better back lit remote and a sleek glass front and other features like pip give this set a clear advantage over the series 5.Now to the trouble I have had. I have been viewing over the air broadcasts and when the signal is weak the tv freezes. The screen goes blank and all functions freeze. I can't change channels or switch to blue ray or pc. I have to manually shut off the tv and reboot it like a virus ridden pc. I have emailed Samsung about this issue and have yet to get a response. Frankly I am very suprised I have never had a day of trouble with my old set.The only other issue I have had is with the color. There are a lot of options for tweaking the color and it took me almost a week to find the right mix for the color orange. I watch a lot of football so I know when the color of any jerzy is off and found it a very frustating and slow process to get it right. My series five was much simpler and had better color right out of the box.If i did not use this set for pc and PS3 I would have opted for a plasma for about the same price I could have gotten a 50\" set, but I have friends that own plasmas and there are still burn in issues with even the latest models.

Of course your tv works for the first few months.I can't even get parts to fix them, they were made to break and be replaced, not repaired.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "john doe", "ReviewID": "R2V0XJB18BLDCQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just go ask your local TV repairman.

Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "RUE1VRELGGVBG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I own this item and before I bought it I also had a larger 46-inch Samsung (model number LN46A750) that I am very happy with.  Oddly enough you cannot find this 46-inch version using Amazon's search, but thanks to Google, it was able to find it for me on Amazon's site, so here's the link:http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-LN46A750-46-Inch-1080p-Touch/dp/B0014175OI  The 46-inch version has a \"Headphone Jack\".  I love that I can hook up my Logitech 2.1 speakers to it.  By \"hook up\" I mean when the speakers are plugged into the headphone jack, the crappy internal speaker that faces away in the back cuts off and I can control the volume of my external speakers using the TV remote.  This 40-inch version (a newer model BTW) has a 3.5mm jack in the pastel green color we come to expect; but when I plug it in, the muffled internal speaker stays on and the external speakers stay at a constant volume despite me using the TV's volume remote!  I searched on-line and found this response from Samsung_HD_Tech on a CNet forum:  \"I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble controlling the volume.The 3.5mm jack is a fixed audio out input, rather than a headphone jack, and isn't controlled by the volume controls on the TV. So the external speakers will require an amp for the volume control.\"  I'm sure for many of you here this means nothing to you because you're either pumping your audio through a proper Home Theater System (HTS) using a second remote or have cranked up the volume to 100 in an effort to discern the muffled dialogue coming out of this TV's internal speakers with everyone around you thinking your hearing aid is on the fritz again.  So, if you're like me and enjoy hooking up a cheap 2.1 sound system to your TV, then definitely pass on this one.  REMEMBER, it is not enough that the TV has a green 3.5mm Audio Out jack - it MUST say \"Headphone Jack\" in the specs and have a little round-shaped icon in the shape of headphones next to it on the TV.  As for the rest of the review of this TV, I can't get past the awful (and I do mean truly awful) sound to enjoy watching any programming on it.  It sits in the garage as a TV for those who lost out in musical chairs.  When we set it up, I noticed it was crooked (welded/glued/fused together) wrong, but it's not noticeable from regular viewing distances.  It tilts down and to the left, like it's turned a few degrees off.  I hear the picture is amazing from the rest of my family (but what else do you expect from a PS3 pumping 1080p to a 40-inch screen).  It is truly a waste of money for the way I want to use it.  I can't even give it away.  If I gave it to my grandma then I'd imagine poor granny trying to watch her tv novelas with the volume all the way up wondering why she can't make out what they're saying.  And I'm not spending 100-200$ on an HTS and teaching my family to juggle another remote.  This is the 3rd Samsung I've bought on Amazon, and everyone who visits the house loves them (they think I'm rich!).

I ordered the tv just before the new year, it got to me quicker than I would have ever expected. Unfortunately that's where my good news ended. I kind of blame both amazon and samsung for the issues that followed: I opened my tv like it was gold, making sure every thing was done correctly (not to destroy the contents). Placed the tv on the stand, put the batteries in the remote, and poured a cold drink. When I hit the power button nothing happened, okay lets try the power on the tv... Still nothing. Not to be out witted by my tv I try a different power cable, with no resolve. Okay, lets make the call to support and see what there suggestions a are; \"Thank you for picking samsung, how may I help you\". So long story short they tell me what I already know and tell me to contact amazon, but they will be more than happy to set up a service to come take a look. After searching the internet find a actual phone number for amazon (which was not easy), they stated that because the no longer have the tv in the warehouse that the can give me a refund and I can buy it from a distributer for more money... Ummm, no! Back on the phone trying to contact samsung only to find out that call centers can be effected by snow. It takes three days to get a hold of them, and the repair people can't come for another week. Okay, the repair guy is here, I get to watch tv right? Nope. So what happened is they didn't have the correct part, and that part if going to take a week and a half to come in, so I wait.... I think they forgot about me, its been a week a no update if they found the right part. \"Thank you for picking samsung, how may I help you\"Me: \"they haven't called, they didn't leave a number, oh and the took a part for reference\"Them: \"that's messed up, let me call them\"Me:\"thanks\"Them:\"they should have it, to install next week\"Me: \"okay\"What I didn't mention was I'm moving this weekend, lucky its just out of my parents house (yay for me!) so I didn't have to set anything else up, who knows how long treasury that would take. Today, after a month of waiting, its fixed with a new bezel. I have no idea how well it works because its at my parents place.Samsung: pick better contractors, your better than that.

Not sharp; not clear; not vivid.  Slightly blurry or runny. Average or worse.  We have tried multiple settings including fine tuning on a channel by channel basis but the video is still unsatisfactory.Perhaps this set works best with an HD input but that is not an option for us at this time.We do note that the picture is significantly better when playing material from an attached computer which reinforces the idea that there is some sort of tuner issue or incompatibility.In any event and unfortunately, it is on its way back to Amazon and we are doing more and deeper research before replacing it.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "WARNING, AVOID SAMSUNG AT ALL COSTS", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R1X6ED7Q10N8RQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Samsung LN40C630 model after searching the web for months.  Amazon had the best price so I pulled the trigger. I received the TV very quickly and unpacked the box and started assembling the stand.  After assembling the stand I began to attach the bracket from the stand to the back of the TV. Unfortunately it did not fit and after looking at it closer it was obviously for a different tv. I began looking at the other items in the box a bit closer. It was then I noticed the owner manual, and remote were also for a different TV(5 series, 46 inch tv I later found out). The stand as it turns out was for yet another model. Frustrated I called Amazon and they advised me to contact Samsung which I did. SAMSUNG customer reps were useless and told me that all of the parts in the box (excluding the tv) were incorrectly packaged.... I asked them how could this happen, they of course never heard of this happening ever. Anyways they told me they would send new parts. 2 weeks later, after waiting patiently, the parts arrived and they were for the wrong TV.At this point I was furious so I called AMAZON and after explaining the situation they told me a replacement TV would be sent right away. A few days later I got a 2nd TV, opened the box and lo and behold the same thing, all different parts. I called AMAZON and told them I wanted a refund,(which they promptly did) and they sent someone to picked up the old TV's.Moral of the story save your money, time and energy and don't buy SAMSUNG products. Obviously they have serious quality control issues, customer service problems and other issues. Just google SAMSUNG problems/customer service and you will see I am not alone.
