{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Laservue Saga", "Author": "Ernst Steinert", "ReviewID": "R123R38RMDU8BF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you all for your entries. Reading them was very helpful to me, and I would like to help others by adding what I experienced this past month. Keep in mind I gave this product a full 5-stars because that is exactly what a defect-free L75-A91 deserves. I also posted this review on the AVS Forum, a great resource for home theater. Also, I make no comments about sound. You don't buy a piece of gear like this planning to rely on the internal speakers.I received my Laservue from Walt's on Jan 3. I prepared three years for this decision, starting with considering the 82\" DLP, then almost the first 65\" Laservue, then waiting for the 75\" 2nd generation. I went to see a local Mitsubishi-run demo over a year ago that included the 65\" Laservue. A Mits rep handed me a confidential sheet that described the next generation Laservues, and it was an easy decision to wait. Also, I'll give up the extra inches the 82\" DLPs provide for the Laservue's elimination of the color wheel and bulb changes.If I want to get a total immersion experience I just plop my butt five feet from the screen at 1080p, and I'm experiencing IMAX! For routine programming 75\" looks great from the sofa 10 ft away. One month after my Laservue arrived, I'm happy. But it took a month to get to this point.Now for my purchasing saga...I had plenty of opportunities to view and buy locally. I really wanted the comfort of getting this thing from a reputable dealer just a few miles from my home. Unfortunately that comfort came at an $800 premium (shipping and taxes factored in) over what I found on-line, so I went with Walt's in Phoenix. They treated me just great and I have no complaints whatsoever. They shipped when they promised, and I got regular tracking updates. I was instructed to look for any signs of damage to the shipping carton, and to reject the delivery if anything suspicious could be seen.The truck arrived right on schedule, and the packaging looked absolutely pristine. They even put Mitsubishi's entire package onto a wooden skid, well strapped in the vertical position. I signed and brought my baby home. It was a very cold day, so I just let the whole thing sit in my home for about six hours before uncrating the product. When I opened it up, everything looked perfect.BUTThe moment I turned my Laservue on I knew something was wrong. The red screen logo popped up, but it had a strange shape, angled in from the sides. Sure enough, so did the picture. It filled the screen for about four inches from the top. Then both sides of the picture angled inward symmetrically. The picture height ended about for inches from the bottom of the screen. I also had the infamous \"tab shadow\" in the upper right corner. Everything worked. What there was of the picture looked great after some tweaking. It was obvious there was severe key-stoning, and I felt it was unlikely the set left the factory that way.BUT I HAVE A SPECIAL LASERVUE HOTLINE...JUST FOR ME!! I registered and called that night, Jan 3, 2011. I listened to the menu choices. Why are they asking me, on a dedicated Laservue hotline, if I want to buy a replacement bulb??? There is no bulb! Hmmm...I got through the menus and waited. My God that music makes me want to strangle the first person I talk to!! But that's not how I treat people, and when someone finally picked up I was a perfect gentleman. It didn't take me long to realize that my \"hotline\" was a low-level call center outside our beloved US of A (Philippines I later found out.) They try hard, but the point is they can do nothing but pass the info along to the real people that can help us, located in California (customer service) and in Atlanta (tech center). I was promised a call-back the next day.Three days later I got a call, but I missed it and it went to voice-mail. It came from a customer service rep in California, Marcus, but there was no way to return his call, except going to the \"hotline\" and talking to our Filipino friends. It took forever to get a live body there, listening to that fingernail-on-the-chalkboard music. Finally I got another very nice call-center person, who had no idea who or where Marcus was, but she promised me a callback before the end of the day. Two days later I was talking to Marcus, a wonderful, knowledgeable fellow. He told me he was personally handling my case. I emailed him photos of my issues and he said he would release a work order to my local authorized service center for in-home repair.GREAT NEWS! That service center is superb, friendly, and close. I called them. The owner took care of me personally, and he said he would come as soon as the work order arrived from Mitsubishi. It took three days, and several of HIS phone calls, with the same music-on-hold. to get the work order. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!!...Mitsubishi wants to brief all service centers working on a Laservue BEFORE they go on the call. This is such new technology that the Atlanta tech center wants to discuss the specifics with the repairman. I think that's wonderful, especially since my Laservue was the first one my center had been called on. One problem... it took another three days for the Atlanta tech center to conduct that briefing. Part of the delay was due to the ice storm that hit Atlanta.When the tech came (it was the owner himself), I was pumped. We're gonna fix this sucker! The \"tab shadow\" has nothing to do with a tab. Mitsubishi knows all about it and told my guy exactly what to do. (EVERYONE: the \"tab shadow\" is really just a peeling supplier label on the inside of the screen frame.) He popped the back of the cover at the top corner and there it was, pretty much right where the shadow is located.Then he went into the service menu to adjust the serious geometry problem, per Mitsubishi instructions. He got it better, but ran out of adjustment. Apparently the Mitsubishi Atlanta folks didn't understand just how bad my geometry problem was. He sent them my pictures, and they came back with instructions to replace the light engine assembly, a sealed unit that contains the chip and it's mirror). They shipped a replacement part 2nd-day air. The next day the tech switched it out and performed the mechanical alignment with the adjustment screws holding the assembly. You get those as close as possible, then do the fine adjustment electronically. He got it a LOT better, but ran out of mechanical adjustment. The best he could do was get rid of most of the key-stoning, and get the whole picture within an inch of the bottom. My Spears and Munsil test pattern still showed significant bowing on the right side.Marcus called. Mitsubishi determined that my Laservue needs to be replaced. This was initiated within 24hrs, and I received full tracking info all along the way. The TV came direct from Mitsubishi's tech center in Atlanta. (I had chosen early on NOT to involve Walt's because this was really Mitsubishi's problem. Walt's did nothing wrong; we did communicate during all this).Mitsubishi provided white glove delivery, and the service was top notch. It was a very cold day and I really did not want to turn the set on right away, but I had to. My Spears and Munsil test pattern was ready to go, and when I turned the TV on the geometry was absolutely perfect. I signed and the delivery guys took the old TV and all the packaging away. As expected, the picture was foggy for a while from condensation on the mirrors, but I could see it improve and after about two hours the picture was perfectly clear. I did some cursory display adjustments with my Spears and Munsil Blu-ray disk. The only thing I noticed is that the factory over-scan setting could be decreased a tad in all directions. Not messing with the service menus until my new Oppo BDP-95 player arrives.I got my original purchase on 1/3. A month later I have a perfect replacement. Perfect geometry out of the box. No \"tab shadow.\" And oh by the way, my old TV \"stuttered\" too when watching cable, but this new one does not do that.LESSONS/THEORIES:DON'T EVEN THINK OF BUYING A LASERVUE FROM A NON-AUTHORIZED DEALER. (Walt's is authorized.)The \"tab shadow\" is a part label that should be removed on the assembly line because the adhesive on it doesn't always hold.I believe my \"stuttering\" was caused by a poor HDMI #1 connection. The cable fits much more snuggly on my new set than on my old.I am convinced, as a degreed engineer, that these TVs don't travel well. I believe a bad pothole hit by the truck can knock these things out with no visible outward signs. They have to turn them on before they leave the factory. I can't believe mine was passed there. I have no worries now that my baby is home, but I believe our poor stretches of interstate can do them in. Walt shipped mine via Yellow Freight. It came through Kansas City to St. Louis, traveling one of the worst sections of I-70, in an ordinary trailer.  The replacement from Atlanta was on an \"air-ride\" suspension truck, the kind used to transport $million medical machines.There seems to be a communication lag between Mitsubishi USA and their call center in the Philippines.NOW THAT EVERYTHING IS RIGHT, I WOULD NOT TRADE THIS LASERVUE FOR ANY OTHER TV I HAVE SEEN. Are you thinking about 3D? You will not get the true effect without a very large screen, and this TV is the best way to get a gorgeous, LARGE image. You'll need the adapter Mitsubishi sells. It works great and takes care of any \"future-proof\" issues. Also, read up on AVS forums about 3D glasses.Happy Super Bowl Everyone!", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "This TV is worthy of it's accolades", "Author": "Darby Rose \"Darby Rose\"", "ReviewID": "R5G6VS9MR9LS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When Mitsubishi introduced their 65\" version of this set, my husband fell in love. We first saw it at a Los Angeles showroom a year ago, and I had a very hard time dragging him out the door. The minute we got home to Florida, he started tracking the information being provided on the \"soon to be introduced\" 75\" version. First, it would be by Christmas, then spring. Finally, Mitsubishi introduced it in August - a long wait, but well worth it.I'm not a techie, so can't begin to elaborate on the amazing features of this awesome HDTV, but if you are looking for a really big screen television, with 3-D like clarity (it is 3D ready) don't hesitate to buy this set. It will make your home the center of football season, with or without the popcorn and beer!The folks at Amazon were very helpful - I think we may have placed the first order for the Mitsubishi L75-A91 that they received. Their \"white glove\" delivery service was exactly what they said it would be. It took 2 burly (but polite) guys to carry in this set, take it out of the box, and plug it in, and they did so exactly within the time-frame we requested at the time we placed our order. Our hat's are off to Amazon - this was definitely the biggest online purchase we ever made, but it went smoothly, without a hitch. And I have a very happy husband!The only \"con\" that I can think of is that this dlp HDTV is 15\" deep, and weighs about 150 pounds, so you can't hang it on the wall. If having a wall-hung TV is more important to you than the picture quality, you'll need to look at a different product. For us, the picture quality, and the fact that our last Mitsubishi lasted 15 years (we just gave it away to make room for this big guy) made this purchase worth the money.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Oh my my...", "Author": "DanL", "ReviewID": "R1XCIRFTYO3B9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got the 75inch Laservue out of the box and did a quick setup.

Mitsubishi didn't make the 65\" so they replaced it with the 75\".  Much joy around the house.  Well, within 3 months the new 75 incher developed a 6 inch white circle in the upper right corner.  Mitsubishi replaced it with a new 75 incher.  Now, 6 months later it died with a black screen.  The tech said the code it displayed was for a bad laser on a 65 inch but was invalid for the 75 inch.

Soriano", "ReviewID": "R22XJXWUE91JWA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV after looking at every big screen TV on the net and in the area.  The Big Screen store is the only one I've seen have it on display.  No, I'm not affiliated with \"The Big Screen Store\" or \"Mitsubishi\".  The colors are vivid and the quality of the picture matches or exceeds any LED LCD screens out there.  The reason why I chose this is that you are getting a LED LCD quality in a 75 inch size.  You have to see it to believe it.  In addition, I made sure I got a 5 year warranty because the laservue technology is fairly new.  I would have given it a 5 star but the cost brought it down to a 4.3 months laterMy TV gave out three months after I bought it. I loved every moment of it till it gave out. Ever since it gave out, I've been in Mitsubishi support hell. Buying this TV supposedly gives you an exclusive LaserVue Premier support. I still think the TV is great, but be prepared for all the empty promises Mitsubishi has given in their warranty support.1 month laterOK, Mits does not have the best customer service but I harassed them till I got a brand new set.  I've had the set now for over a month with no problems.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "YelcickFam", "ReviewID": "R2V21Z3DDF2NNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, this is the first review we have felt compelled to actually take the time to write.  We have been tracking the laservue for some time, and decided to wait for the next generation when Mitsubishi released its original 65\" version of this TV - to let them get the bugs out, so to speak.  It was well worth the wait - I saw people review this TV and give it poor ratings based on the price without even owning it - I am glad these reviews were purged - complete and utter nonsense.  Basically you get what you pay for - we think we received a lot of value for this TV.  The picture is phenomenal without adjustments, other than not using the bright color option - we opted for the cinema color mode.  I saw on other reviews that the bright color option makes everything look cartoonish and unreal, and we agree.  Cinema mode is perfect for our tastes.  The only nit-picky thing is that the built in speakers aren't that great, but then again, whomever is buying this TV is unlikely to be without a good audio system.  We are picking on it a bit, mainly because I had to figure out how to get our Bose sound system to be controllable with the remote, and this is more a Bose issue because their equipment is RF controlled rather than IR.  My brother is a real video/audio phile (just his projector for his home theater cost many multiples of this TV), and even he is impressed - I thought he would never admit it.  The clarity from Blue ray and Hi-def pictures is amazing - almost like looking at a live 3D picture there is so much depth and clarity.  So, in summary, we would purchase this again in a heart-beat - no regrets.  We have had this TV for nearly 2 months using it with Verizon's FIOS, Sony PS3 (mainly for the blu-ray), and Wii.  We did get the 3d set up as well, but at the moment, there isn't a lot of content that allows us to take advantage of it - even the 3D kit that comes with the TV doesn't have a 3D movie included - just an intro from Disney (really cheesy - they could have at least included one good title for the $$ spent).Update - found out probably why no 3d movies were included, so we can't complain too much - apparently 3d content providers signed deals with the different tv manufacturers to include exclusive movies with each of their sets for a period of time.  Guess Mitsubishi didn't get on that licensing boat, can't really blame them.I saw someone give this 4 out of 5 stars purely by seeing this TV at a store, and not by owning it or being able to compare to other hi def equipment that is directly owned by other video-philes, etc.  That drives us nuts.  Seeing a TV in a store without someone there to adjust the TV for you and/or to make sure the best source of video is being sent to that TV is a waste of time.  Most stores do not hook up content to their TVs one of one to a specific source, like a blu-ray, instead it is routed through splitters, amplifiers, etc.  The person basically said the picture wasn't as sharp as other TVs.  Ugh.  The picture on this TV, even at 75\" is razor sharp out of high def sources, especially blu-ray.  If you take a source from a non hi-def player, or run it through an amplifier, etc. of course you won't have the best viewing experience.  If you want to compare, you need to go to specialty retailer and make sure that the source on each tv you are comparing to is identical, and the TV is adjusted appropriately (color, etc. - see our comment regarding default color on this TV can cause some issues regarding the picture).In addition, TVs have different characteristics - for example Plasmas tend to be brighter, on the other hand their screens are very reflective.  We looked at the top end Panasonic plasma, but it wasn't as large, and the reflective screen was a big issue - we have a ton of windows (14 4'x2' windows) in our great room which would make the plasma, even for its extra brightness, a disaster.  Yes, this TV isn't quite as bright as a plasma - on the other hand, it isn't Dim either - more like a traditional DLP.  It is fine even in a brightly lit room, although sometimes we do turn up the brightness a little if we are watching something special during the day. The reality is we do most of watching of movies, etc. at night where brightness isn't an issue at all.Update Jan 2012 - Still loving the TV.  Picture still crisp and bright, no issues.  Would still buy this TV again in a heartbeat.  I was sorry to see some people rate this poorly because they received a TV damaged in transit....  really not a fault of the TV itself.  I would suggest don't give up on it - just get it repaired or replaced under warranty.  Still a little bummed over the lack of good 3-D content.  We did find one shortcoming because the 3-D processor is external with one HDMI input - we have to switch what cable goes through it - the PlayStation3 for the blu-ray vs the FIOS dvr...  would be nice if it was built in.  when there gets to be more content out there, I can see I am going to have to get an automated DVI switch", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture", "Author": "gunmahoro", "ReviewID": "R2G2KA60W6450X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this TV for about three weeks.  It is connected to a Denon AV receiver, Samsung 3D blueray player, 3D hardware, and a Home Theater PC (HTPC). Viewing angles are very wide, so positioning this TV will not be a problem.  It has six video settings. If you have a bright room, the brilliant or bright settings will have no problems overcoming incoming light. Cinema produces natural colors. Make sure to read the manual for various screen settings. My HTPC resolution is 1920x1080. With normal screen settings the borders of the computer screen expand beyond the tv max screen size. The proper setting for the tv will adjust the screen so there is an black border of about 1\", but all of the computer screen will be seen. The black will blend in with the tv sides, so you will not really notice the border.The picture generated by the laser is nothing short of breath taking. Many scenes in Blueray movies are nearly 3D looking. A good example is from the 'Sky Crawlers'. There are several scenes which appear 3D. It is an amazing experience to see. I can only comment on the 3D demo disc which came with the Mitsubishi 3D hardware.  But that was a pretty amazing watch as well. The picture and overall effect was much better than I was expecting, so I'm looking forward to some 3D movies when they come out (the ones I want to watch).I had trepidations about getting this TV.  After a week of viewing, I have none.

It is huge, no doubt, but actually does not look disproportionate now that it is parked nicely in the corner of my den on a 73\" wide console. The picture quality is pretty amazing and it really strikes you when watching a Blu-ray. The picture is so good in fact that it makes the deficiencies in other picture sources obvious. I have DirecTV hi-def hooked up via HDMI and while it looks great, it makes me wish I could watch everything in 1080P all the time.Delivery was quick and free. I ordered on a Friday and it was in my den on Wednesday. Two delivery guys brought it in and set it in place for me which was nice. Not sure if my Amazon prime membership had anything to do with this or not.Pricing - I searched for lower pricing online for the 2 weeks after my order shipped and while I did find it cheaper on a couple of sites, Amazon did not honor them for price protection. I was told that they were not authorized Mitsubishi dealers. None of the approved competitor sites on Amazon's list seem to carry this TV. Which brings up another point, it's difficult to find anyplace to see it before buying. Certainly nowhere around here in NC had it. So I bought it sight-unseen and felt OK about that due to the no hassle/free return guarantee from Amazon. Once I got it setup, I knew I had not made a bad decision. Was it worth $5200? I would say yes. Also keep in mind when checking other sites for pricing, even if they say free delivery they do not mean inside delivery. They drop it in your driveway and you take it from there. It's much nicer having someone else do the lifting and taking the packing materials away.I also sprung for the 3D add-on kit. I'm not sold on 3D but thought I would give it a try since the TV supports it and since DirecTV is offering some limited 3D content. Having nothing to measure this against I would say that the 3D picture looks good but I'm just not that crazy about it, or sitting around with dark glasses on. It's just not that comfortable for me personally but at least we have it in place and can take advantage of new programming options as they become available.Thumbs up on this purchase. We're happy with it.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Mitsubishi L75-A91 review", "Author": "Bernard T. Lopinski \"Bernie L.\"", "ReviewID": "R2B3BA6QNIQE2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a big t.v., but surprisingly not too big. I went from a 62\" dlp to this 75\" dlp in a small apartment. The thin bezel design uses the real estate effectively to allow a big picture without overwhelming the room. With an overall depth of 15\"(including base) it's 3\" shallower than the 62\" Toshiba.LASER LIFE: According to a source at Mitsubishi, the lasers should have a life similar to the life of a CRT picture tube, so laser replacement should not be an issue.PICTURE (out of the box, no pro calibraton): Picture looks good. Something to be aware of, the picture really depends on the source, not just for content but for quality. In Toledo I use Buckeye CableSystem. The difference between a normal channel/picture and a HD channel/picture is very evident. There is also a noticable difference between a HD network picture and a HD premium channel such as Showtime HD, HBO HD, etc. Blu-ray DVD is outstanding (standard DVD also improved). The sample 3D DVD in the Mitsubishi starter kit (kit costs extra) looks great, just like a Disney 3D movie at a theater. Some other 3D movies are not so great and seem to be format dependent. Remember, you have to have a compatible 3D source for the t.v. to display 3D.SOUND: DO NOT buy this t.v. if you're expecting great sound via the t.v. speakers. Really! The t.v. sound is like going from a big boom box to a transister radio, tinny and not much depth. For the price I'd think a better quality sound would be included. Apparently, the thinking is that buyers of this t.v. will install it in a home theater setting to include a better audio system. I have my audio running through a Bose Home Theater system and it sounds great, but when I'm just casual watching (not movies), every time I listen through the t.v. speakers I'm shocked.THE PURCHASE: In general, this is one expensive t.v. but deals are available. Amazon lists a varity of dealers/prices. Through Amazon, delivery was by Home Direct. The guys carried the t.v. to my apartment, uncrated it, and set it on the stand. All packing materials were taken care of. Because of the cold outside, I let the t.v. sit for four hours to let it warm to room temperature before firing it up.Buying from Amazon was easy and fast. One thing I was surprised by though, I bought my t.v. in March 2011. While registering with Mitsubishi I noticed the Manfactured date was November 2010. It could be just me, but I expected a little fresher t.v. It is new/unused, but four months in the tech world is a long time for tweaks and mods to happen.

When I read the reviews here I went to the nearest store that carries Mitsubishi and checked it out. It looked pretty bad in the store. No detail in the black. I bought one anyway. Got it home and it looked just as bad as in the store. I figured I would have to take it back as it was very inferior to my Samsung LED DLP. I assumed the factory settings might not be perfect but must be in the ball park, but decided to see what I could do with the picture. Well, it turns out the factory setting are insane. It has a \"deep field\" feature wipes out any detail. The contrast is set full strength probably to try and fix the damage done by the \"deep field\" feature. Sharpness and color are over done no doubt for the same reason. When things were toned down and the deep field feature turned off, the picture became amazing. What a relief.

Best picture I've seen on ANY HD TV - LED-LCD or PLASMA - Worth EVERY penny", "Author": "HiDefGuy", "ReviewID": "R1RXXX8OX9WSWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a regular \"guy\" and I don't write a lot of reviews of products with the exception of really bad or really good items I've purchased.  Also, I'm not technically proficient in the area of TVs.  So this review will only be concerned with the quality of this TV from my eyes and ears.First off, I was going to order this from Amazon.com but checking out the companies that sell this TV through Amazon I found the reviewers who bought their set from Walt's TV in Arizona had the best experiences with regard to shipping.  I called Walt's TV and the salesman (Miles) gave me a break of $100 cheaper than Amazon's price with free WHITE GLOVE shipping.  Because of the positive reviews on both the TV and Walt's TV, I went ahead and purchased it directly from Walts.The people over at Walt's TV are great to deal with.  And that's important when it comes to buying something this expensive on-line (this TV isn't available anywhere in the state I live so it was either buy or not).Long story short, I have never made a better purchase in my life!!!  The TV got here in just under 2 weeks - longer than I had hoped for - but there was a mistake made by using the wrong shipping company that would have resulted in curbside delivery.  I noticed this error in my tracking the TV on it's way to me.  I called Walt's TV and told them about it and by the end of that day, arrangements had been made to transfer the TV in Boston to another company that would deliver the TV to me with the full WHITE GLOVE treatment (2 guys bring the TV into your home, you inspect the outside of the box for any damage, the guys remove the TV from the box, plug it in and when the picture comes on and it is okay, you then sign for it and the guys also remove the shipping box and all packing materials, and they even put the TV on the stand for me).  What could be better than this?With the TV out of the box and on the stand, I can't explain how HUGE this TV is.  I mean it's B-I-G!!!  I attached my Hi-Def Cable box and W-O-W I was in heaven.  I have NEVER seen a picture from ANY TV manufacturer, whether LED, LED-LCD or PLASMA that could even come close to the quality this set gives.  The experience is literally the same as going to the movies!!!One very important thing to remember is this is a LASERVUE TV.  There is a BIG difference between a LASERVUE and the other models by Mitsubishi.  The difference is that the other models can't come close to the LASERVUE as far as picture quality.  The difference is utterly staggering.  I cannot praise this TV enough.  I plan on purchasing a 5 year extended warranty on this TV as well and Walt's TV allowed me 30 days to buy the warranty at the discounted price (a little short of $700.00) but well worth it as it covers IN-HOME service by actual Mitsubishi repairmen.  I could go cheaper on a warranty by using a company other than Mitsubishi but in my opinion, I'd rather not take the chance to save a couple hundred bucks.I also purchased the complete 3-D kit directly from Amazon (which includes 2 pairs of 3-D glasses-battery, non-charging type) and I will be installing the hardware this weekend.  I also bought 3 extra pairs of 3-D glasses (from Amazon.com) that are re-chargeable at only $50 each and they are even better than the ones that come with the kit.  The only fault I would say about the glasses is that I wish they came in a hard case (like Panasonic's do).  But if you keep the glasses in a hard quality case (like the large Otterbox's) you will have an even better case to protect your glasses from damage.  I can fit up to 3 pairs of the glasses in one of the large Otterbox box with room to spare for extra batteries, etc.I can't wait to see how 3-D will look on the TV.  Albeit it will be as good and even better than my experience thus far.If you are seriously looking for the best large screen high-def TV out there with 3-D at a price of under $6000.00 you can do no better than buying this TV.  $6000.00 is the retail price for this TV.  I paid $3400.00 for mine.Also, I highly recommend Walt's TV based in Tempke, Arizona.  They've been in business for 50 years so they're not going to disappear after you purchase your TV.  Like I said, they are a pleasure to deal with and will do everything within reason to satisfy their customers.  They've made a believer out of me and I'm more often than not, a skeptic, based on raw deals from a couple of major TV manufacturers - the worst of the lot being SAMSUNG.So do yourself a favor, and skip all the other manufacturers around, forget about LED, LCD, Plasma and get the best TV made right now - buy a LaserVue by Mitsubishi.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "ordered online sight unseen", "Author": "ivebinbad", "ReviewID": "R25D7YJKJUZNWO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was stalking this baby for months reading reviews and hd forums, most of which where very positive.

Regardless my initial impression of this TV is WOW!The size is perfect for me sitting at roughly 7 feet away giving me a movie theater type experience.I use the TV mainly for movie watching and gaming. I got the TV yesterday and only had enough time to setup it up and watch TRON on Blu Ray (It was very comparable to when I watched it in the theaters, if not better). I will post an update later after I start trying some games out of this bad boy.The TRON Blu Ray I purchased also included a standard definition DVD copy. I used this as a perfect opportunity to test HD vs SD on the same movie. As expected on a TV of this size the Blu Ray is noticeably more clear/sharp/vivid. However, in my opinion this is not a reason to freak out and throw away your DVD collection. DVDs and standard definition sources display just fine on this set. They are just not as good as HD sources (Obviously).The inputs/outputs are easily assessable from the right side of the unit. The TV has tons of settings you can tweak to get the image looking just right for you in your environment.Really the only thing I don't like so far is how heavy this thing is. It took a couple of us to get this beast up the stairs and it wasn't easy. But the weight and price of this TV is worth the amazing picture and quality it provides. Don't settle for any of those \"Thin/Light\" alternatives that cut performance for the look. Do yourself a favor and get a truly amazing set.For those considering the new A94 LaserVue. In my opinion the A91 at its current price is a far better value. The only major thing I saw different on the two is the A94 now has WIFI on the TV, which I don't care about. But if that is a big thing for you, then spend nearly twice as much money to get it. I'd rather get a dang good price on a dang good TV.Highly recommended. I purchased mine from OneCall on amazon. I was highly pleased with their service and the degrees of protection they took to ensure my TV arrived safely.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "BREATHTAKING.", "Author": "T. Ryan \"Glumpo\"", "ReviewID": "RVK01YADHXHM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the set for about 2 weeks now, and I'm still stunned every time I turn it on. It seems impossible that a DLP television could generate a picture like this. I happen to own a Samsung 55\" led lcd tv, and so comparing the 2 has been fun. I'd say that the Samsung has a bit more \"crispness\" to the picture, but beyond that the Mitsubishi wins hands down. The colors on the Laservue are something you'd have to see for yourself to belive, and as I've said before, at times it's like being lost in a technocolor dream. Mitsubishi claims that the set produces twice the amount of color as any other tv on the market, which initially seemed like some type of gimmick to me, but seeing is believing.  The black levels that it produces are way beyond what the Samsung can muster,  and the amount of depth in the picture is well, amazing. You will notice a big difference between blue ray and standard dvd's, and the standard ones will no longer seem adequate. The same goes for non HD broadcasts, they look just ok, and will quickly remind you how much better hd sources look. The 3D works quite well, but this set requires shutter glasses which have been purported to give some people headaches, although no one in my family is bothered by them. The TV I replaced was a  73\" Mitsubishi dlp that used a bulb for back lighting. While it had a very nice picture, comparing it to the laserview is...well let's just say it would be unfair to compare them in any way. The 73\" bulb driven tv can be had for as little as 1199.00 shipped however (if you watch for sales,) and don't get me wrong it's got a beautiful picture, just nowhere near what you'd see on a flat panel led or the Laservue. My only concern about the Laservue is life expectancy. I've read that the lasers should last about 60,000 hours, and if this is true, that's many, many years, but this is new technology, so time will tell. I'm told that the lasers will never lose there intensity, ie they will not grow dimmer over time, but again we'll see. I would have to say that this TV is not for everyone, and even though the price has dropped substantially, it is still quite expensive, especially when you compare it with the prices of some quite beautiful flatscreen lcd's. However, there is a huge difference between a 60\" screen and a 75\" screen, make no mistake. I did get my Laservue for 2999.99 shipped, but I noiced they are a bit higher now, not sure why. So in the end, if you can afford this tv, buy it, and I mean TODAY!

Now, less than 2 months later I see is for $3,600 on Amazon and given the tax free nature and good return policies, I'd recommend go with Amazon.The TV itself is stunning  I'm scheduled to get it calibrated by a pro, but out of the box, the two major settings I use are 'brilliant' and 'cinema.'.Use Cinema or 'game' for most of your everyday watching.  Watching a movie like Black Swan on Cinema is every bit as good, if not better than watching it in a high end digital theater.  Except you don't step in gum on the way out :)However, 'brilliant' is what you turn on when you want your friends to fall out of their chair.  Put on movies like Star Trek (2009), Cars or Speed Racer.  Movies with alot of sharp 'over the top' colors, and put this TV into brilliant and you find you weren't aware your eyes could see the depth of color shown.  It's almost like they built the TV out of Neon.When Lighting McQueen pulls out of the Trailer in the opening seen in all is super bright red shiny glory, its absolutely mind boggling looking at this TV vs. anything else.The 3d is good, but maybe its my content, but I remember alot of 3d in theaters where the image doesn't just go 'in' to the screen' but pops out in front of the screen.  Yet I've yet to really see that affect with this TV.  I don't know if its the limited show's I'm watching or a limitation on the technology.Unfortunately the TV needs an add-on kit to be realistically 3-d ready.  That adds more cables and remote control complexity.  It takes a fair amount of button presses to bring up 3d content and then go back to 2d.  I'd hoped this would all be automatic.  I don't know if this is the case for other 3d TV's.The only other minor complaint is when you switch between certain settings (such as cinema or brilliant) or switch sources, it takes a fairly long time for the TV to start displaying a new image.  For about 5 to 10 seconds you stare at a blue screen with your source (i.e. DVR) displayed in the upper left corner while it get's its act together.Over, very very satisfied.  I have not seen a TV look better than this, and of course, nothing under $20k can come close at 75\" with other technologies.  I would say 75\" is the minimum size you need to truly appreciate theater like 3d at home.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing tv", "Author": "George C.

I score pretty well with color sight tests so I feel I am well qualified to comment. In bright retail showrooms most consumers will pick the TV that has the most vibrant colors that \"pop\". While this is what makes the first impact of a presentation, it is not what is true to the senses in the long run and what will be easy to live with later on down the road. In a showroom with many LED and LCDs set in torch mode, all Mitsubishi DLPs will come up pale in comparison. Those flat screens will look surreal in comparison and the DLPs will seem to be lacking. I own a Samsung UN55C8000 and the L75-A91. The Mitsu viewing experience in a dark room with bias lighting is much more visceral than watching the Sammy in comparison. The viewing distances are equadistant so I can hold the picture quality comparison as being fair. The color accuracy of the Mitsu is far more accurate in cinema mode than any other TV in stock settings.If you are considering getting the best TV possible, this TV along with the Pioneer Kuro and the Sharp Elite should be taken into careful consideration. It also helps to know that the Laservue only consumes 128 watts which comes out to less that $13 a year running 8 hours a day, while double that price doesn't mean much to most, I like the idea of being \"green\".", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV and Great Service", "Author": "J.

When this tv arrived I just could not get over the size of this beast. 75\" is huge when you see it in person. I hooked up my dish network set via hdmi and fired her up. Standard res 480i does not look good on a tv this size ,but go to hd channels thing look good at 1080i. I also have a ps3 hooked up for my blu ray player. 1080p is absolute eye candy.

Before I purchased this tv I watched every type of review they had on the laservue. From what I seen I thought all I needed to buy were the ir 3d glasses. I was wrong the ir emitter they talk about in reviews is for remote controllers. That means you need 3d glasses, 3d ir emitter, and a 3d signal adapter ,so a ps3 can reckonize the 3d tv. Just by coincidence I watched my first 3d movie(transformers3) in the movie theater over the fourth of july holiday. When I came home the last parts I needed to watch in 3d had just arrived at my door step. I watched imax space station in 3d. After watching both practicaly back to back.

Over the years friends and family have followed the latest LED, LCD, Plasma and LED/LCD formats.  The 3 to 5 year lifespan of Plasma is a joke and the others aren't much better.  LEDs don't have the pixel quality, LCDs didn't have the intensity so they compromised with the LED backlit LCDs, which of course can't achieve uniformity across a large screen. For uniform picture quality on a 50+\" screen it is front projection which has it's own set of limitations like minimun room size and lighting restrictions, Plasma which has yet to achieve a lifespan that amortizes the cost, or rear projection. My Sony Halogen rear projector I bought in 2000 was great, and is also still working as good as new, but this Mitsubishi LaserVue is the Platinum standard. Even if you have the room and dedicated environment for a front projector, or are willing to spend +$3500 for a new Plasma every 3 to 5 years, none of them will have the 6 color pallet or pure white light source of the LaserVue.
