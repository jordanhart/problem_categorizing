{"Reviews": [{"Title": "5 Stars. Here's why...", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R31RM3UQM44M91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In considering what TV to buy my parents, I had the apparent choice between buying an led LCD or a plasma. I opted to get the led, but you wouldn't really be wrong to go the other route. My parents just wanted any TV that was bigger than 50 inches while I, being somewhat of a techy, needed to find the best TV over 50 inches. Well, here you have what I would call the third best TV over 50 inches (the 8500 and 8000 models being better) at the time of this review. This is the first of Samsung's new line of lcds to come out this year, and it narrowly beats out last years 6 and 7 series TVs by offering a better contrast ratio (4,000,000-1 vs. 3,000,000-1) for virtually the same price point. Otherwise, it's pretty much identical after reviewing the specs. Newer is better though in this case also because of the firmware upgrades and other fine improvements in engineering and technology.The TV was delivered about 5 days after I purchased it through Amazon, and it took about 15 minutes to set up. Out of the box the thing looks incredible. It's as thin as a blackberry! Some assembly was required with a phillips head and about 10 screws to attach the tv to the stand, but it was only 4 steps total and added to the suspense. After plugging in literally two cords (the hd component cables and the power cord) you are up and running. When the picture came on it was CRYSTAL clear. It puts every other TV I've seen to shame. You can go to Best Buy and do a side by side comparison and you won't find anything better. Forget about the plasma, this is the way to go. I could describe in more detail how great the picture is, but suffice to say it's flawless from movies to news to sports. Even if this is not your first HDTV, you will notice a big difference. I bought a 32\" 240 mhz set in Decemeber and this tv is in another league. The LED side panel illumination works well, and there is very little adjustment of the settings necessary to achieve true to life picture quality.\"True to life\" will be understood in a new way when you buy this TV. The longer it has been since your last TV purchase, the more breathtaking this advancement in technology will be. Regardless, this will be a TV that will have a useful life for years (longer than a plasma) and will always look amazing. That being said, I would get the warranty (2 years) for an extra 170 or so.Note: I chose lcd over plasma because lcds are noiseless and don't have the risk of picture burn-in. The 58' plasma I was looking at is the same price. This TV is better than plasmas priced less at the time of the review. If price is the main concern, I might do an in store side by side comparison with cheaper plasmas to see if the difference to you is worth the money.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV, but may be too big for my room", "Author": "M.L.", "ReviewID": "RXIOKUPI9ZCND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to a local electronics store to buy a 46\" LCD to replace the Samsung 46\" LCD I just broke and ended coming home with this. F ry s had it on sale for 1 5 0 0, so we decided to spend the extra 6 0 0 to buy this.  I was torn about not buying the Samsung TV with the Internet functions (Netflix, Pandora, etc..) but we have the PS3, which makes up for it.  We had to decide between the Samsung Models LN46C630, LN46C650, UN46C6300, UN46C6500, and this model UN55C6300. They were priced and 8 7 9, 1 0 3 9, 1 3 2 9, 1 4 9 9, and 1 4 9 9. We were only looking at Samsung because we have had only good experiences with Samsung until I accidently hit the LCD :(( (Crack!!)  Long story short we walked out with the 55\"On to the Review:Before purchasing this TV, please consider your room size. We are about 10ft away from the TV and this is about as close as you want to be. There is a big difference between a 46\" and 55\"The setup was easy.  The size of the box makes it difficult for one person to carry it but the TV is light enough for one person to lift it.  The first step is to attach the back plate to the base with 5 screws, next it is suggested to use two people to put the TV on the base.  I was able to do this step by myself. It has tabs that latch in and 5 screws to attach the TV to the base.All 4 HDMI Ports are located on the side, so may need to use the cable management system that comes with the TV.  There is also a component video connection. There is no COMPOSITE video connector, which is a slight con for me because I need to buy a new connector for our WII. So if must have a composite connector on your TV then this TV is not for you. I did not dock the TV any stars for this because I could have looked closer... Besides composite to old school and I do not mind buying the component cableThe TV powers up fairly quick and noticeably faster than our 550 model I killed..The clarity of this TV is amazing, the colors really pop out and are well defined. It is almost like the people on the screen are in the room with you. I thought Blu Rays were unbelievable on our 46\" LCD, it is trippy watching them on the 55\" screen. Talk about seeing the pores on people's faces. Maybe it is a little too good of a picture :D (I know, no such thing) There is defintely some reflection from the TV but not enough to bother us.The sound is on par with our previous Samsung, which not great for audiophile people but more than enough then we need for our family.Because it is a LED LCD it is thin. It is a little over 1\" thick.  Not as thin as the 9000 series but I do not have that kind of money laying around :)I highly recommend this TV for anyone with a room larger enough to accomidate it.  I am not having any buyers remorse. If anyone has any questions please post a comment and I will try to answer them.7/18/2010 Update - Just a quick 2 month update.  The TV continues to amaze and the Blu-Ray are just insane on this TV.  I see the electronics store has 6500 model for 200 more than we paid for this", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "Island girl \"island girl\"", "ReviewID": "RGX68FNC41DD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had this tv for 2 months and it just doesn't seem like it could possibly be any better.  The colors are so true and there is so much depth that it actually seems 3D at times.  When you play a Blu Ray the colors pop even more and you really feel like you are part of the picture or scene.  I have done a double take at times because it appears so life like! We love this tv and are so happy when we get a chance to relax and watch it (not often enough!).  Wall hook up was a breeze and it has enough HDMI inputs to make it even easier.  I wouldn't recommend the Samsung Blu Ray player though if you are running everything thru a receiver. Samsung's \"Any net\" gets confused about what you are trying to do. Or at least the Universal remote doesn't recognize that the tv is in control of the Blu Ray player. (Or maybe it's me who gets confused on what it is trying to do!)  Anyway, I can't imagine any other tv delivering a better picture than this one.

However right out of the box I noticed that the lips were not in sync, and also that the display was skipping frames very often.I have a DVD player, Blu-ray player, and a Satellite HD Receiver (Dish Network) All hooked up, and all sources have the same problems. I've tried the HDMI input, Coaxial, Component, and Composite inputs. All result in laggy video and out of sync audio.If I use the HDMI cable and the tv speakers, the audio is in sync. However with any external audio receiver it becomes evident right away that the video lags the audio by a lot (at least 120ms). Even if I turn \"Game mode\" on, the video still lags, just not as bad.Even if I upgrade to an audio receiver that has a delay function to try to sync the two, that would not help because the time between the audio and video delay seems to vary a lot. In other words, without changing anything, the audio and video will go closer to in sync and further from in sync throughout the day. This is a very frustrating problem. My BluRay Player has a built in delay function, but it maxes out at 120ms. When I have it at that setting, the lip sync problem is significantly improved, however the video STILL lags the audio very noticeably!The choppy video appears significantly when the \"Auto motion plus\" feature is enabled. The strange thing is that even if turn this setting on to \"Custom\" and turn both the blur reduction and the judder reduction to zero, it will still skip frames regularly. With the Auto Motion Plus turned off it will still skip frames, just very infrequently.The video I posted demonstrates the choppy video problem. You can see at the beginning of the video that the panning looks smooth. Then I turn on the \"Auto Motion Plus\" on the TV, and play the same exact segment again. This time you notice that the video looks much more clear during the panning, however it is extremely choppy. Every second it \"Skips frames\".Another strange thing about the choppy video problem is that the frequency of frame skipping changes with what show/movie is playing. For example, LOST in HD would skip frames every two seconds, driving us nuts and forcing us to shut off the \"Auto Motion Plus\". However Spiderman 3 on the same channel also in HD showed hardly any frame skipping at all. Blu-rays allowed me to have the auto motion plus setting on pretty high, but it would still randomly skip frames throughout each film.I know one of the responses I'm going to get will be just turn the auto motion off, but this setting does a spectacular job and was one of my main motivations for upgrading to a Samsung TV in the first place. Even with the frame skipping you can see that the picture is so much clearer during panning and overall, and it is such a shame to have to turn it off.The best way to describe what I am seeing is that it is like I am watching TV on my computer, and my computer's processor can't keep up, and therefore the video skips a bunch of frames every so often. This makes watching anything a lot less \"fluid\" and distracts me from getting \"sucked in\" to what I'm watching.I called Samsung and they said they've never heard of either of these problems. This gave me hope that I just have a bad TV. So they sent a technician out, and he replaced the processor and the power supply. No cigar, same exact problems after he leaves. So I exchanged the TV for another brand new one, take it home, and same exact problems. Looks like that's the way this TV is supposed to perform.Another thing that really irks me is that they combined the component and composite inputs. This means I have to choose one or the other two hook up; I don't get both. That means if I want to use my VCR, I have to disconnect the component input from my DVD or Blu-ray player.Between the audio and video always out of sync with my external speakers, and the fact that I can't use the \"Auto Motion Plus\" feature that looks so amazing but does not work properly, I am at a loss as to what to do. My wife is distracted by these issues, and shes not a picky person at all. Do I hang on to this and pray for a firmware update that will magically fix either or both of these problems, or do I take it back and try for another brand? I'm thinkin' its going back.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV - no complaints", "Author": "clarkKent", "ReviewID": "RJ80FXSPPUEKW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many others reading this review, I put a lot of research into which TV I was going to buy since I was paying so much. I upgraded from a 37\" Sharp Aquos LCD. To sum it up, I am very satisfied with purchase and would buy again if I had enough money.Let me help ease some concerns that I found while I was researching this product.Flashlight/clouding:For the majority of people, you will probably not even notice this. I had read so many complaints about this that it nearly kept me from buying this TV. I had to research exactly what this issue was because at first I did not know what flash lighting or clouding was. Once I found out what I was looking for I checked my Sharp LCD to see if it had the same issues and occasionally it did. But the fact was I had the TV for 5 years and neither I or anyone else that ever saw the Sharp noticed it. The Samsung 55C300 does have a little flash lighting in corners but honestly I had to really \"try\" to find it and when Im not looking for it I dont even notice. While it may be an issue for some people, I believe for 90% of people looking to upgrade their TV, this is not an issue, and the fact is you will find complaints about flash lighting/clouding on almost every LCD/LED TV. Only a few TVs I came across had no complaints with this issue and those TVs were way out of my price range.Off-angle viewing:I think everyone knows that plasmas have the best off angle viewing and that LEDs are not great in this area. But for me it wasnt an issue because I have my TV set up in a place where off angle viewing will never be a issue and I have it on a swivel stand in case I need to turn it. So this wasnt an issue for me as it might be for some.Lag time:Lag time was another issue I read alot of people complaining about and since I play alot of xbox 360 and ps3 games this was almost a deal breaker. However Im happy to say I just dont notice any lag time, when I press a button it reacts instantly on the screen. I notice no difference between lag time in this TV and my old Sharp LCD. Maybe there are some video game \"nerds\"(some of which I can tell by watching their screens in Call of Duty), that to them things dont move fast enough, but those people dont have anything better to do then to complain about lag time so dont let them turn you off.Judder/frame skipping:I watched the video from the other poster that showed his cable program skipping frames on this TV. I have played blu ray, video games, live TV, and DVRed TV and so far I dont notice this frame skipping on anything. With or without Motion Plus turned on or off or used with different settings, its just not an issue.Glossy screen:I read some people complaining about the screen being so glossy that they couldnt even watch the TV. I dont know if these people are just easily distracted but its not that big an issue. You can see a glare in the TV if you look for it but when its on the picture is so bright and amazing that I dont even notice a glare. I even shined strong lights directly into the TV and I could still see the picture fine.Summary:You may come across many bad comments all over the web regarding this Samsung TV or other higher end models, but do not be afraid. Notice everwhere you find reviews, you will have maybe 1-5 bad comments but the other 90-95% are all positive reviews. Im not denying that some people have issues with the TV but I think for the majority of people, the issues are not that big of a deal. From the complaints I was reading I was expecting a unwatchable TV set that would lag, skip frames, have flash lighting that made tv unwatchable, and screen that acted as a mirror in reflecting light because of its \"glossy\" screen. That is the kind of TV you would expect after reading many of the reviews out there, but Im here to tell you most of it is overblown and for under $2000 you can expect a fine piece of equipment. If your looking for the \"perfect\" TV, I have read great reviews on the SamsungUNB8500, but have fun getting that for a decent price.PS: DONT SPEND MORE THAN $10 on HDMI cables", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is a Great TV, but not a Perfect TV", "Author": "Lopsided", "ReviewID": "R11X711051OE72", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV was an upgrade from my Samsung LNS4051D 40-Inch LCD HDTV.

Both issues have been eliminated with this upgrade and while my husband could not pick up on either I would not describe myself as a videofile, simply picky.Here are my opinions on:------GLOSSY SCREEN------I feared the high gloss screen would prove too reflective for me as I have a bay window on the side wall. Though I can easily see the reflections when looking for them it has not been a deal breaker for me for the same reason I prefer a gloss screen on my computer rather than a non-glare... the color representation, the depth, the clarity are all fantastic. The picture really is stunning.------ACCESSING THE INTERNET-----This model does not have independent internet access features. However, I access the internet and my computers media files thru networking with my PlayStation 3 250 GB so I felt paying more simply for an internet connection was senseless. That is available on Samsung UN55C6500 55-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTV (Black) and the like thru Samsung Apps.------LACK OF 3D------I also could not convince myself to purchase a Samsung UN55C8000 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV merely for 3D TV. I have viewed it in the stores and while it has a cool factor it would not be long before I was sick of wearing glasses in my living room and felt motion sickness. To me at least, 3D is nice for a movie night but it simply won't tempt me to part with my money for the chance to say I have a 3D tv.-----WHY IT's NOT PERFECT------The one thing I don't like is the obvious brightness at the corners of the screen. This truly is the only negative I can find. This is only seen when the room and picture is very dark or the scene is displaying black in the corners. So, depending on the movie, you may not see this frequently enough to be readily aware of it. (My husband claims he can not see it.) This keeps the screen from being \"seriously\" black in dark scenes and that's a shame because the fantastic contrast ratio yields deep, dark blacks. This is a known issue/side effect with edge light LED technology used on Samsung TVs. In order to eliminate this I would have to move up from \"edge lit\" to their \"local dimming\" screen and for that shell out quite a bit more for the Samsung UN55C6800 55-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTV (Black) or Samsung UN55C8000 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV, to name two. I realized this when I purchased the c6300 (which I got for $2K minus the $150 in certificates I had) and with the falling prices of technology I could not bring myself to spend even more for a TV, I also did not want to wait. If I felt it was a long term \"investment\" I would have spent the extra money, but I personally don't feel as though TV technology is long term in my house and certainly doesn't qualify as an investment due to the falling prices. :)", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV w/ the latest technology", "Author": "John Villalovos \"Engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R10AEJ78R9XNHW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased and took delivery of this TV from Amazon and delivery was quick and efficient.  I had read just about all of the online reviews that I could find on this TV.  Since, it is so new, there aren't many.  The TV has a fantastic picture quality and it seems that some images and scenes look more \"real\" than standard LCD TV's.  Somehow, it often seems to have more depth and detail (almost 3-D'ish at times) than standard LCD screens with their standard CCFL back lighting.  I also felt that this Samsung's edge-lit LED panel had a superior picture to other brands of LED/LCD TV's.  Aware of possible chinks in the armor, I had read about the \"blooming\" or \"flashlight\" effect emanating from the corners of the screen when the screen is black, or showing dark scenes.  When I first set-up my TV and it was going through it's auto channel programming routine, the screen was all black and I did notice the slight blooming effect of faint cloudy light coming from the top two corners, for several inches.  However, it was not excessive, and was just discernible, and I have not yet noticed it when watching program material. Because the panel is so thin and the LED's are located on the edges and still have to carry light to other parts of the screen, with special diffusers, it is extremely difficult to completely suppress light \"leakage\" under all conditions with this type of back light configuration.  But, the reality is that, likely, these types of conditions constitute a very small percentage of one's total program viewing time and experience.  I have also noticed the occasional artifacting with some high speed movement, but, no more so than any other LCD TV, I've seen, even some at 240Hz.  I do like the frugal energy use that this 55\" LED/LCD Samsung, has, along with it's super slim profile and sharp looks that are modern and updated, yet, understated.  However, the biggest factor that got me to pull the purchasing trigger, was the tremendous picture quality.  A beautiful bright screen, with sharp detail with high contrast and rich colors, that once set-up properly, looks super accurate and super real!", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid picture quality and performance", "Author": "Brett", "ReviewID": "RJ8TZHHUYBO6S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews talking about jittery output from a 1080p source, I was a little leery buying this TV but I am glad I did.  It did take almost 2 weeks to deliver through Amazon though and the tracking provided via CEVA was a little misleading.  That was the only part of the whole experience that could have used improvement.  I also purchased the Peerless SF670 low profile mount through Amazon.  The mount was already installed when the TV arrived so I mounted the brackets and the rear plate covering the stand hole on the back and the new TV was on the wall and hooked up in 10 minutes with one other person helping.  Although this TV is light enough for one to pick up, it is bulky and it would have been dangerous putting it up alone.The picture on this television is as advertised: great color, detail and refresh.  There is a setting for Auto Motion Plus that comes activated in Standard mode from the factory.  This is probably what caused other people so much trouble with the jittery performance.  This mode for me also caused studdering and jittery playback for 1080p content.  Setting this mode to Clear or turning it off alltogether clears up the problem.  The Auto Motion Plus feature is ONLY a gimmick and although it looks kind of neat in a trippy way, I could not imagine watching ANYTHING that way for any period of time, even if it didn't studder.  Some have talked about getting a firmware update to fix the jittering but I didn't even bother because I would rather watch movies the way they were intended to be be displayed, not in some surreal bizzare way.I am pushing 1080p from 2 sources... an XBMC media server running on an Aspire Revo with HDMI output and an HDMI HD cable reciever, all switched through an HDMI matrix switch with over 30 feet of HDMI cables.  The audio is tapped from a TOSLink fiber connector on the matrix switch and fed into an Onkyo DTS reciever.  Through all of this wiring, the picture has always been full 1080p and there is no delay in audio vs. video, even with the audio tapped upstream from the video. In my setup, I only run two cables to each TV, one HDMI and a return optical in case the audio ever was out of sync with the video - like I said though, no problems there so not really needed if you are using a HDMI switch with digital out.All in all, this TV was a very good value for my setup and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.  I have only had it a week though so have no comment about reliability.Update 4/25/13Even if this screen is not available anymore I do want to say that with editing projects and entertainment, it has been on at about 80% of the time since purchase.  I have had NO problems whatsoever with this display.  It is great and I have no complaints.  The current model is probably less reliable, while plugging you in more and offering less.

I returned this TV and picked up a UN55C6800 which also has edge lit LEDs but with precision dimming.

The contrast ratio is amazing.  Shortly after installing this TV, I helped setup a similar Samsung non-LED model (LN46C630).  The difference in contrast ratio was very noticeable to my now trained eye.I used the Samsung WMN1000B kit to mount it on the wall and it was simple to follow the instructions to mount it.  The quality of the parts in the kit was top-notch including everything that was needed except for the 1/2\" drill bit that I had to purchase to drill through the wallboard and metal stud.  It is so slim to the wall that a neighboring framed painting actually sticks out more from the wall than this TV!I have noticed that a full dark gray picture (ie: black but not quite a complete black, as in the brief flash between a program and the 1st or last ad) exposes the only flaw I have seen.  When this occurs, you see a splotchy picture from uneven backlighting.  I believe that this is called flashlighting.  This is hardly a negative because I could care less what the picture looks like at that point.  If the TV detects pure black, it looks like the LED backlighting is actually turned off and appears black.The other downside is the viewing angle.  It works fine for us, but at some viewing angles the picture starts to wash out and the flashlighting is more noticeable from the corners of the screen.  However, if this is noticed, stepping to a narrower angle appears to resolve this appearance.  Again this is only noticeable if you are focusing on it, especially with a not-quite black image.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV........maybe!", "Author": "Judillia Kennedy", "ReviewID": "R3A5BRAMPRRYCA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unboxing and setting up the tv went quickly, only a few minutes to powering up.

I expected the low resolution shows to not be up to par but to my surprise many of the HD channels were poor and some completely unwatchable.  I do not in any way think poorly of the TV, it performed well when it had the correct input.  I spoke with tech care and tried tweaking some settings, but no luck fixing it.  I think a smaller version of this tv in a spare room might perform better since the smaller screen size would hide any issues the service provided.

Delivery was on time and as-scheduled, but quite a circus with all of the miscommunication from Pilot.  They called to confirm delivery, and explained how the drivers would bring set into the house, unpack, set-up and test.  Later the same day, Pilot called back to cancel delivery because TV hadn't been received on their end, and that they would call to reschedule once they had the TV.  Then, on the 'cancelled' delivery date (and without any prior notification), a Ryder truck pulls up out front and it's Pilot with the TV!  Driver and helper bring in the box and asked where we wanted the set.  I pointed to the TV stand, at which point they told me that they only place the box where the customer wants and don't do unpacking or set-up!  Quite a mix-up but we were happy that we happened to be home to accept the delivery.Anyway, onto the TV itself: it has a beautiful, vivid and crystal clear picture -- but only when viewed from head-on. The picture qulaity really suffers as your viewing angle moves towards the sides.  The colors begin to wash out starting at about a 30 degree viewing angle and get progressively worse as the angle increases to the point where the picture is downright horrible.  Searched the web and tried numerous calibration settings combinations (many can be found on the avsforum).  Some settings lessen the off-angle washout effect, but not to an acceptable level.  This is especially troublesome for our room layout, as we have an \"L\" shaped seating arrangement.

We originally started off with a Sony LED TV (EX700) but found that it had such a narrow viewing angle that we decided to return it.  After heavy research we landed on the Samsung UN55C6300 but even this TV had issues.Pros of the Samsung:The Samsung has a much better viewing angle than the Sony did. In fact, I believe that the only better viewing angle would be the LG 5400 or 5500 series or better.  Remember, however, that even for a Samsung the viewing angle is quite narrow (like ~30 degrees off center).  The TV is super thing (1.1\") from top to bottom. If you plan to hang it on the wall this will make it look real nice.  The remote is backlit, allowing for dark room viewing.  There are many, many user settings that can be adjusted - almost too many - which I like since I like to be in control of the TV and it's settings. Fast channel switching - while watching digital channels you can blast through them very quickly unlike the sony which took about 1 second for each channel change.Cons of the Samsung UN55C6300:Outside the viewing angle (30 degrees or more) and colors fade and get washed out and the reds tend to over-saturate making the picture unwatchable (or untolerable). I expect the PQ to degrade on wider angles however, on the Samsung it was the over saturation of some colors that I had an issue with. On our Sony, the colors would washout but the TV was still tolerable and extreme angles. Not this Samsung, unless you like a lot of red.  Gloss screen isn't that bad however, reflections of lights and bright spots behind you will cause \"rainbows\" on the screen which will be visible in dark scenes and can be distracting.  Auto volume normalization is implemented in a horrible, non-functional manner. If you enable the auto volume normalization (under sound settings) then be ready for erratic sound volume changes. For example, if a scene became loud the TV would auto-adjust the volume down but would do it so drastically and in one step that it would be immediately obvious and noticeable.  Then, if the scene got quiet and there were voices, you could not hear them until the TV adjusted the volume back up. Auto dimming (auto brightness) is a \"feature\" that cannot be disabled. You can turn off the backlight auto-dimming under \"Eco\" settings, however even with these settings off the TV will still make adjustments to the brightness. This can be distracting at times although most times it's not noticeable. The TV remote has too many buttons.  I like controls, but the remote has so many buttons I felt I had to study it every time I wanted to do something.  Out of the box colors were horrible. Samsung tends to over-saturate their colors so what may look great at Best Buy will NOT look so great at home - under normal viewing conditions. I spent hours trying to tune the colors so that they looked right. Connecting to a PC (or HTPC running windows media center) was a real pain.  Unlike the Sony that \"just worked,\" the samsung I had to go online and read about proper settings for PC connections (not as simple as connecting the HDMI cable). Black levels and color schemes (studio vs pc), screen fit, etc, were all now factors I had to learn and understand in order to make the proper TV settings so that MCE would look OK.  Samsungs implementation of the \"Auto Motion Plus\" is overdone compared to others causing severe \"Soap opera effect\" in nearly every show, luckily this can be easily disabled or adjusted down. Light bleeding from corners - in both Samsung sets we had noticeable light bleeding from the bottom two corners.  The light was noticeable on black/dark scenes and at first was distracting until we got used to it.After two weeks of owning this TV we decided that we would live with it's shortcomings.  Some of the annoyances were tolerable and others could be turned off in the settings.  However, we started to notice a major problem with the TV which began to catch our attention every time we were watching a show.  This problem is red tracing, or red shadows.  We noticed that in scenes that contained reds or browns (ie: brown hair or clothing) that a character would have a red shadow on their face or a red trace or outline around their body or head during movement or panning.  It became way distracting.  We called the retailer who sent a Samsung certified tech out to our house. Within 10 minutes he determined that the TV was defective and needed a part. Being on our last return day we opted to return the TV instead. Our replacement Samsung had the identical issue - red tracing and red shadows.  So I immediately packed up the new Samsung and returned it, this time opting for a Sony KDL52NX800.  Out of the box the Sony just worked in so many ways (better color, easier setup).  Admittedly so the Samsung does have a slightly better picture than the Sony (when it's tuned right and doesn't have red tracing) and a slightly better viewing angle, but we're sticking with the Sony now.In general I believe the Samsung to be a decent TV but you should know what you're going into. The picture on it is amazing, especially from a blu ray, once it's tuned right.

The picture on this TV is amazing and great quality, but we were disappointed in the amount of glare with the screen.

The look of the TV and the picture quality are fantastic, but I kind of wish I'd paid attention to similar reviews warning of the glare and considered the LG.  Also, when you first connect the TV, it is on an auto setting which makes the programs look like a \"live\" taping (that's the only way I know to describe it...like every program looked like it was filmed just like SNL)...it makes you very aware that the actors are ACTORS on a SET and it was very distracting...we did NOT like that at all.

Out of the box it took mere minutes to mount on the stand and set viewing preferences, this was easier because I bought this TV to replace an older problematic Samsung DLP TV, so I'm familiar with the Samsung menu format and user interface. This TV is so much of a visual improvement over my old DLP that I can only describe the picture ( especially for 1080p HD sources) as georgeous. So for that purpose this TV met all my expectations.The few points I would mention to potential buyers of this TV are, before you buy consider all that you will want from this TV. I live in the Caribbean and therefore we do not have access to many of the online services like \"Hulu\" for example, so the Internet and widget management and access were less of a necessity for me. If this feature is important to you, then there are other TV's in this price range that offer both built in wifi (this TV requires a separate proprietary dongle) and similar visual performance.The TV design is a bit of a personal style issue and yes I did find the screen to be a bit reflective but when the TV is on this is less of an issue and that is when it really matters, isn't it? The stand design, slight forward lean and \"nervous\" screen flex when mounted do not scream \"stability\" but coming from a large base DLP TV that could just be me.The \"home movie HD camera\" look to programs does take some getting used to as it is a departure for most from the warmer softer feel of  480i/p and 720i/p programming but in this case \"change is good\", as I will gladly get used to it in exchange for the additional clarity and detail that you gain.Have only has the TV for a week, but so far have watched quite a few Blu-Ray movies and a fair amount of programming through my local digital cable provider and I am very pleased so far, if this changes due to issues that arise ( which I hope there won't be) I will update my review.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Help regarding gaming on this tv.", "Author": "Skygazer629", "ReviewID": "R2J9TAH2EXKFOR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for several months and experience problems when gaming with the screen seeming to lag.

Very good picture with crisp, rich, brilliant colors and good blacks.  I watch mostly golf; this is clearly an upgrade from my 4 year old DLP Samsung, which was already excellent.  The picture is easily bright enough for full daylight viewing.  No LED side-lighting issues.  No blur watching basketball.  Thin 1\" panel.  This TV is much slicker than the typical 3 or 4\" thick ones.  There are recesses for all connections such that they come out sideways within the pocket (parallel to the plane of the panel) and with Samsung hardware you can hang it very close to flat against the wall, like a picture. Viewing angle is terrific, even from way off to one side.  It is very light; only about 45 pounds with stand.  The VESA mount screws are 480x480 if you use a third party wall mount.  The included stand is quite nice.  The bezel is pretty thin; about 1 1/2\" wide on the sides and top; 2\" at the bottom.  Overall height dimension was actually less than my 50\" prior model.Cons:  Despite the Samsung marketing line, this panel is quite reflective--more on par with a typical plasma than an LCD.  It's much more reflective than a similar LED thin-panel LG model.  This does not bother some people; their eye seems to focus on the plane of the TV and they don't even notice it.  For others it's like looking in a mirror.  If reflectivity bothers you, don't buy this TV unless you can angle it away from bright sources such as lights and windows.  This is what we did, and as a consequence, even though it's in a room with big windows, the angle is such that none of the windows or overhead lights reflect back to the viewer.  You will notice the reflectivity particularly when the picture has a large area of uniform dark color such as blue or black.  I might add that the bezel itself is reflective, which annoys me.  For some reason manufacturers seem to like that.Since I bought the TV knowing how reflective it is and knowing I could set it up to avoid reflections, I'm not disappointed in any way, and give it five stars.  Delivery from Amazon was 48 hours from order entry.  I paid $2100 delivered to my door but would not be surprised if it could be found for less elsewhere.  If cost is an issue and thinness or weight is not, I suspect you'd get the same or similar picture from a less expensive plasma TV.

Over the air HD channels from the antenna would result in TV becoming unresponsive, if the digital signal was weak - the TV would create a picture with small broken squares when the signal was weak - and eventually the screen would go black. Trying to navigate through the channels would not work any more until the TV was restarted.The channel navigation was very slow - about 12 seconds lag when moving from one channel to the next.The Standard Definition picture from our Dish network receiver was of very poor quality with shadows of images all over. One would say this would be expected when connecting a HD TV to Standard Definition, however our LG LX6500 3D TV does a much better job of displaying the Standard definition with no shadow at all.Overall, this TV is not the best option if you plan to view over the air HD Channels.

It is simply fantastic.  I don't even know how to start this review off.  But here it goes.  Because the picture is so good when you watch TV it looks live, like you are right there.  Now how can this be a bad thing?  I am not a technical hound but trying to explain this is very hard.  It is the difference between watching day time soap opera and night time programming.  The clarity is so good that everything you watch seems like you are watching a day time soap.  Or some really cheesy adult film off of HBO.  So, when you are watching a movie that looks like that brings to mind that \"bad\" quality, when in fact this is excellent quality that makes the movies look cheesy.All I can say is before you buy this TV ask them to let you watch a normal movie, whether it is BluRay or a DVD it doesn't matter, check out the quality and see if you like watching all your programming in day time soap style.  It truly is bizarre at best and I honestly can't tell if I like it.  I like the quality and how clear the picture is but I don't like the cheesy feel of live/soap/adult movie style.  I am so on the fence.My family and I watched Toy Store 3 on it and I was just dumbfounded on the quality.  It was so good I was in awe most of it just watching the fine details you can't normally see.  Like the texture of Mr. Potato head and the plastic look of dolls.  Truly amazing.I have only had the TV for a week now and I am very impressed with the quality. I bought the Samsung 3D BluRay player with it and love the fact they are integrated.  I tell the TV to switch to BluRay and it turns on the BluRay player.  Very nice!I probably confused everyone with this review but I want to ensure that you watch a normal movie/cable instead of the feed the store gives you.  Then you decide if you like the \"live\" look of the movie.  Also, it does it to your favorite TV shows.  I love Two and half men, and when I watched it, it looked like live performers on a stage.  I can't really explain it but it just looks very strange.  I am sure I will get used to it.I read people compaining about glare.

The vast amount of tweaking and options for this set is great, you can brighten, darken, change all kinds of things in between. It also has BD-Wise which lets it speak to other Samsung devices (Blu-Ray players, etc..) and pick the best picture quality.Some people complain about the Auto-Motion Plus feature, but I think it's amazing. When the setting is enabled it makes the visuals look filmed with a home video camera/soap opera, almost too smooth. It will take some getting used to but is ideal for new Blu-Rays and great fast moving action films. It smooths every motion on screen and sometimes people don't like the effect because it looks too smooth and takes away from the movies intended blurs. I disagree, but to each their own. And the setting can always be turned on/off or even tweaked for some but not full force.My only small gripes with the T.V. are the viewing angle could be a bit better, and the sound is OK but not great. I eventually broke down and bought a sound bar and wireless sub 2.1 just to hear the voices better in Blu-Rays. Without the sound bar the speakers are just too small and don't really cut it, even compared to just a sound bar and not the full 5.1 surround. I also wish this T.V. was capable of built in wifi with Netflix, alas it is not. I instead bought a Blu-Ray player and watch Netflix through that. But I knew this previous to purchasing it anyhow.I kind of wish I got the 60\" however the price was much much higher, overall I love this T.V.GradesPicture Quality: A+Sound: B-Aesthetics: AEase of Use: B+Tweaking Ability: A+Inputs: C (needed a component and composite, not just one that is shared for both.)*Update* Keep in mind this model only has one input for composite/component. It actually shares both with the same input, not one of each. This kind of sucks, only because I have a lot of old video game consoles that are composite, so I have to use a switch. Which isn't a big deal.However now the component game systems I have won't work because the composite/component input is shared and there is only the one I am already using with the composite splitter. Otherwise I still love this TV and it still performs excellently.Overall: A", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "accountant from charlotte, nc.", "Author": "B.

It arrived quickly from Amazon and it was well packaged.  The TV is thin and light for its size, which is the major selling point of this thin LED backlit LCD televisions.Wall mounting was painless and without any issues.  For those who do not wish to professionally calibrate the television, the automatic calibration and preset settings work well.  For anyone who doesn't like the presets, there are several websites out there that have posted professional calibration settings of this family (C6300-6500).  The colors are crisp and vibrant and in my opinion rival the plasma display that I was also considering at the time.  There is some motion blur in fast scenes, but adjusting the picture settings reduces this to the point that you can't really notice.  The television also works great in a brightly lit room because of its powerful LED backlighting.  The one negative with the picture--a negative that I frequently notice when viewing dark scenes--is that the edge mounted backlights cast some brightness around the corners.  This begins to get annoying, however it's price you have to pay if you want a television this thin and light.  LED backlit televisions that are not edge lit do not have this problem, however they are thicker and heavier.  If you watch television in a dark room and also watch a lot of programming that contains many dark scenes (such as many movies), then you might want to consider either a plasma or an LED backlit unit that has local dimming.  If the room that I have this TV set up in were not so bright I probably would have gone with a plasma.  If you want something light and thin, then this is your set as long as you can live with the edge lighting issue.I can't comment much about the sound quality from the speakers, as I have them hooked up to a surround sound system.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV!", "Author": "Ron from Florida", "ReviewID": "R1MN5JFCRYUPW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are very satisfied with the TV.

It was a round-about way of doing it but Amazon were helpful as usual and the process was easy, if a bit stupid because it would have cost amazon less to just match the price I assume. I bought this largely off reviews and the good price (1499) rather than doing any real research and I wasn't disappointed. The form factor is excellent, just a bit thicker than my blackberry, and the frame is unimposing and doesn't distract from the screen. The picture out of the box is impressive, needs a bit of adjustment to make the picture look 'real' but still very good. I can certainly tell the difference over my previous LCD TV (Toshiba Regza). The auto motion feature is hit and miss, sometimes it looks great and gives a 'live-tv' feel and sometimes it adversely affects the picture. You can adjust the options related to it but I often resort to just turning it off, and the picture looks ok anyway. A disappointment for me was the clouding/flashlighting in dark scenes, it it worse if viewed off-angle and not so bad from straight on. However I would still purchase this set knowing what I know. You can probably avoid this problem if you go for the 6800 model but this one is/was a bargain. I can plug my HDD into the USB port and play media files/videos/pictures directly using the Samsung media player whereas I used to hook up a laptop using HDMI. I really like this feature.

I considered ease of getting service, brand reputation, features, picture quality reviews and, of course, price.  I bought the TV on black Friday for an excellent price ($1499) from Amazon.  The unit shipped promptly and I was able to schedule delivery within a 2 hour window.  The set arrived a few minutes early.  I knew from my research that the delivery service included unboxing, assembly (installing the base), putting the TV on the stand I had for it, connecting it to power and a signal source (in my case a cable DVR) and making sure there was sound and picture.  However the person that brought it in (there were two men) asked me to sign for the TV without doing any of the above.  I asked about the additional service and he said \"if you want us to do that you will have to initial some boxes on another paper\".  I said, \"no problem\" and they proceeded doing all the installation steps I expected (no additional charge).The picture looks good, the TV has a LOT of adjustments (which is good and bad) and a lot of inputs. So far (three weeks) I am very pleased with the set.  I watch HD content from cable and have played some DVD's on a new Blu-ray unit I bought to go with the TV.  All input looks good  - even non-HD content seems sharper on this set.  My biggest negative issue with this TV, and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars, is the difficulty in adjusting the picture to look good.  I assume this would be a problem with any TV of this quality level.  I have a 22 inch Vizio which I was able to adjust fairly easily (a day or two of adjusting the various settings).  In the three weeks I have had this Samsung TV I spend some time EVERY day trying to get the picture to look \"right\".  If I get it looking good for a movie, then a live show or taped show isn't exactly right.  Again, a good and bad is that there are 4 separate groups of settings for EACH input.  The problem is that one cannot copy/paste settings from one group within the 4 groups for each input nor to a group for another input.  So when I find a set of settings I like I have to make the same changes (and there are dozens of adjustable settings) on at least on group of each input.I believe I am getting close to what I think are optimum settings and eventually I think I will not be frequently adjusting the set.  I DID go online and found multiple forums that suggest settings that they arrived at either by their own trial and error or by using professional alignment devices.  But while these settings do get me in the ball park, and probably saved me time, they are not what I think are optimal for what I think looks good.The other negative is the black levels.  To get the screen to look really black, the brightness has to be turned down too far.  Fortunately I sit fairly far from the set (about 14 feet) so I can keep the brightness as high as needed without seeing the black become too grey.  But if I move within 4 feet of the set, the blacks are more grey (washed out).  I can also see (even far back) some grey near the lower right and left edges of the screen on SOME scenes when those areas are supposed to be black.  I think that is due to the edge lit LED, but maybe not.  The problem is not major and I usually do not notice it because it is limited to a small area near the edges.  I think most people would not notice or care, but if you are a perfectionist it could be irritating.I would recommend this TV to others.  I do not have Wi-Fi or internet access near the TV so I am not interested in using the set with online services.  Supposedly this set has the same picture quality as more expensive models in the 6000 series.  So if you want a great looking picture and do not want to pay for features internet based features you cannot use, this is a wonderful choice.  I was also looking at a 55 inch Vizio that has backlit (not edge lit) LED's.

McIntyre \"phantom1584\"", "ReviewID": "R18PYIAIB10GI2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this up 4 days ago.  I upgraded from a 46 inch samsung lcd (ln-t4665f).  Here's my thoughts thus far...I put this on a traditional tv stand, and installing the base was simple with the provided screws.  Just note that there are two sizes of screws, 5 each, and put the right screws in the right holes.The video quality over my last tv is amazing.  It is much more crisp and clear, with excellent colors.  Every shape was well defined.  With the size of the TV, it almost seemed like looking through a window at someone sitting right there.However one thing I wasn't prepared for was what an adjustment it would be for myself viewing wise going from a 3 year old 46 inch lcd to a modern day 55 inch lcd/led.  On the default settings, it did give me and my wife a feeling of motion sickness.  I'm viewing it from about 10-11 feet away.  I put in a blu-ray (wall-e), and it actually seemed too clear.  The movement of things just didn't seem natural.  This could have some to do with the 120Hz auto motion, which I did play with disabling, but it didn't fully remove the effect.  Picture looked very pretty, but just not what I was used to.  Its the same picture I'd seen in the store and it seemed fine there.  I think it might have been because the store was a more open viewing area that it didn't seem to bother me there.  I've been playing with the various settings, hoping that it will reduce our motion sickness feeling.  Time will tell on that.  I don't think this will cause me to return the unit, but I'll keep the box to play it safe.Overall, the set looks great on my corner tv stand.  Picture is amazing.  I don't notice any light bleed or color unevenness.  I just hope I can adjust to the size, or the motion differences, or whatever it is about this set that is causing me to feel a bit \"off\" while viewing.  I've been looking online for some calibration settings, but there isn't much out there yet for this particular model.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Bit Disappointed", "Author": "Surf City Bill", "ReviewID": "R105ET1XHCI8RI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time researching plasma vs. LED and came to the conclusion that you almost couldn't go wrong if you stayed with the market leaders....Samsung for LED, Pana for plasma.  So, I bought one of each for a family room and a master bedroom.  Both pictures are very good. However, the LED fell short in two regards.  Oftentimes the picture has a \"soap-opera\" quality to it.  Very noticeable while watching \"Back to the Future\".  I found that very distracting.  I thought I could get used to it. But after a month I couldn't.  The 2nd issue was more problematic.The stuttering or jittery picture which was very noticeable during \"Terminator\" made the movie difficult to watch.Also, I could never get a signal over 60hz even on the best HD channels.  I've read that the 120hz rating on this TV is a myth, however I have no way of proving that.  I had no issues with the audio but I never had it connected to a home theater system where I have also read a lip sync issue occurs on external devices.  Two more strikes against this TV.I will admit that for casual viewing (sitcoms, animation, nightly news) the picture is very, very good.Considering I've had zero issues with the plasma (which was less expensive by the way), I finally admitted my mistake and returned the Samsung for another Panasonic plasma.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow.", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R2DIA043PAL3QG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bright, vibrant, crisp picture.

I bought this TV on last Thanksgiving, just two month ago. This TV has been placed in my living home under very light use. I do not have cable service at home so most of the time it was only used for play some bluray and DVD disks. I probably only used this TV couple of hours each week in the past two months. I have to admit its picture quality is superb. But this can not justify its poor manufacturing quality. Tonight, after I turned on my TV for only several minutes, everything disappeared from the screen all of the sudden. I unplugged all the power wires and surge protector, and put them back on again. Still nothing was shown on the TV except a repeating clicking sound coming out from its back panel. As an engineer myself, I can tell clearly it is a failure of its power supply. I know Samsung's warranty should take care of the problem, but this is so annoying. It's broken in just two months! For a product with a high price tag, this is way too fast! Samsung's TV was built with such an incredibly low quality.

I've been researching into Samsung consumer electronics, especially TV's, and found general positive reviews on the performance and quality. So I went ahead and ordered a brand new Samsung LED TV 6300 model. The price tag without sale is over two grand, therefore, I expected to have top-notched performance and picture quality. However, into the second day of using it, I found two (02) adjacent dead pixels near the top left corner of the screen. They were so bright that they are visible even in the bright scenes of the broadcast programs. I called Amazon and scheduled a replacement immediately. One week later, a replacement came in. This time, I double checked carefully every aspect of the TV and found nothing...at least until the third day watching it: I have found another three (03) dead pixels, this time on different lines, right at the top left corner. I have no complaints whatsoever about the picture quality. In fact, I love the vibrant color and sharpness of the picture so much that I asked for the replacement of the very same model.
