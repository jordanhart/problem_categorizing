This set has the Quattron technology which adds the color yellow to the RGB spectrum. I have noticed that the colors are sharper and more vibrant. Purists will tell you there is no advantage to adding an additional color to the RGB spectum. All I know is I can clearly see the advantages in overall skin tone color, background colors, and I even noticed more intense eye colors on actors! Something I never noticed before on my plasma or standard LCD. I previously owned the Samsung 55C7000 set, but was turned off by its screen uniformity issues and \"flashlighting\". This set does exhibit some screen uniformity issues, but none to the degree of the new Samsung edge lit model I previously owned.I found these calibration settings on the 'net' and they really help dial in the Sharp's colors. I will share them here:Backlight -2Contrast +25Brightness +1Color +1Tint -2Sharpness 0CMS Hue Keep at 0CMS Saturation Keep at 0CMS Value Keep at 0Color Temp LowR Gain (LO)+8G Gain (LO)0B Gain (LO)+25R Gain (HI) +9G Gain (HI)0B Gain (HI) +17Gamma -1These settings are a great, and a little tweaking to your liking will have you viewing your Sharp in a whole new way!BY THE WAY: The picture AMAZON is using to identify this set is incorrect.

I decided to replace a 50\" Panasonic plasma which had a great picture but I wanted something larger and really liked the led models.  My initial selection was between Samsung and Sony but when I saw the Sharp picture, I just knew it was the right one.  I used to consider Sharp a second tier TV but no longer.....beats the Panasonic plasma.  The picture is famtastic and the audio is  not bad but I use a separate sound system.  I do think that the addition of yellow to the typical RGB pixels does add to the picture.  Am very pleased with no complaints so far.

It worked for 15 seconds then the video has gone blank and locked in a diagonostic mode.From the very fine prints of the manual, I found the service number to call for help.  The represensentative on the line responded very fast and was very courteous and helpful.  The on-site service technician came within a week and fixed the faulty board. I gave the factory qulity 3-star for poor quality control.  I gave the field service 5-star fro fast and courteous on-site service.  The on-site service warranty is 15-months. Very good.The picture quality is good and 7 inputs connections.  But the audio output only has 2 options. 1. Simply stereo output with 1/8\" pin, very flimsy and not practical. 2. Optical output that may not work with old amplifier. I am using blueray player to provide the sounds input.The screen is very thin (less than 2\") and looks very efficient. Built-in speakers are decent but nothing to brag about.I use antenna to receive broadcast signal, the channels recognized are less than a 28\" Sumsang TV that I have.

Now they tell me it's $505 to replace it and I have no other options, as it is not an orderable/repairable part.I'll never buy another product from Sharp again.EDIT: After complaining to Sharp on their Facebook page, they agreed to keep their promise of replacing my TV under warranty.

I loved this tv until I start noticing shadows on the four corners. I was distracted by the \"flashlight\" effect on the top edge of the screen, especially a blue sky scene or light color background. I also noticed the same \"flashlight\" effect when I was watching blueray movie with the black bars on the top and bottom, more severe at the top edge than the bottom edge. I really tried to ignore it, but my eyes just kept going toward it. Don't get me wrong, the reason I purchased this tv was due to the spectacular picture quality. I have heard that the \"flashlight\" effect could have been caused by over tighten screws in the back. I did see one or two reviews regarding the shadow corners and \"flashlight\" effect. If it is the tight screws that is causing this defect then Sharp should pay more attention as to not over tighten those screws. I'm disappointed that I have to return the Sharp Aquos Quattron lc60le810un.

Bauer", "ReviewID": "R3E3541HVM4AWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this 60 inch Sharp TV locally because we wanted it for a family gathering at Thanksgiving - and because we had doubts about how successfully it could be shipped.  The store personnel (Best Buy) were adamant that it not be transported lying flat on the side of the carton because that would leave a large expanse of glass unsupported. They were afraid that it would flex enough to damage the circuitry on the back of the panel.  The shipping box is quite thick because the TV is shipped with its base in place.  In order to get it into our minivan and set it vertically, we had to take the shipping box apart. The top and sides of the box are one piece and it slips up off the unit.  We left the TV standing on its base on the bottom of the shipping carton. We were able to tip it enough to get it into the van and then set it upright for transport.  When carrying it into the house, we held the screen, not the carton base (which might have buckled under the weight).Everything works beautifully, especially after applying the settings in K.C.Cole's very helpful review.  It's an awesome TV! We have it connected to an LG Blu-Ray player, an XBOX 360 with Kinect, a WD Live local network access box and the cable box.  We have not tried the built-in NetFlix access yet, but the setup appears to be straight forward.We mounted the TV to the wall on a OB150C Omnimount \"full motion\" flat panel wall mount. (Sam's Club, about $100). The mount is rated for up to 63 inch screen size and 150 pounds. This TV only weighs a little over 70 pounds with the base removed.  The mount works well and does not seem to be overstressed. It allows the TV to be extended from the wall as well as tilted and swung side-to-side.  If playing some of the new games, be careful to orient it so that the ceiling overhead is clear of obstructions.  Our 6' 4\" son took out a track light while playing volleyball.If you have the room for it, this is a great TV.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best 60\" LED for the $", "Author": "Jonathan Lisak \"UFGatorGuy20\"", "ReviewID": "R1HVOAEFH1OEEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:- Incredibly vivid color spectrum.- Brightness capability beyond any LED I've seen.- One of the most energy efficient LEDs on the market (if not the most).- Accurate 120Hz frame interpolation.- Massive options menu.- Sexy design.Cons:- Average audio- Out of box configuration- Some inaccurate colors- Reflective screen- \"Flashlight\" effect at top borderSummary: After weeks of research and demos at multiple electronics stores (Best Buy, HHGregg, etc.), I purchased this television for $1759 at Sears about a week before Christmas. I'm still stunned at how great of an LED I bought for the price. (FYI, I upgraded to this TV from a 52\" Sony XBR3 LCD that I paid $4999 for 3 years ago).Everyone has always preached Samsung or bust to me. Samsungs are great TVs, and I am prepared to drop a mint for a quality tv. But, I really wanted to find a stylish 60\" LED without breaking the bank this time around. I think this LED is going to help Sharp close in on the top of the market.First, the advertised four-color LED pattern that produces wider a blue and yellow color spectrum IS NOT A GIMMICK. You can see much deeper blues and yellows in this set. However, you will need to carefully adjust your hues and temperatures in the options menu to maintain an accurate picture. Otherwise, your picture will seem to have unnatural contrast and some colors will appear almost neon. Adjusting the settings will take some patience, but only because there are so many options in the menus. The out-of-box configuration is pretty laughable. The default brightness and contrast is utterly ridiculous. But, after about 30 minutes of channel surfing and blu-ray playing, I found a great configuration that blows me away. NFL, ESPN, News, and Blu-Ray have never looked so good. I'm a huge gamer, and the vivid colors are simply incredible on my XBOX360, PS3, and Wii.Don't expect much in the sound department. The internal speakers are pretty average. I have the set hooked up to a very good LG surround sound theater. So, this wasn't even a consideration for me anyway.The screen is very reflective. However, not enough to make any input unwatchable in even my bright living room during the middle of the day... that's how bright and clear the picture is on this tv.This tv's design is also head and shoulder's above so many (which is important to me). It doesn't have a cheap boxy plastic looking frame like 90% of the other sets on the market (one reason I purchased my sleek XBR3 and a big design feature that directed me to this tv).Overall, these minor drawbacks had no impact on my rating or satisfaction with this set. If you want a stylish looking tv that backs up its looks with surprising video performance at an incredible price... look no further.

It's a BEAUTIFUL and impressive TV. It came with a one year warranty and we were given a 3 month additional warranty from Sharp. The TV stopped working less then one month after the warranty expired. We called Sharp and as someone else already mentioned, they offered us first a free repair by giving us a month extension. THEN, they called us back and said sorry, you'll have to pay $500 for a refurbished one or have a local repair shop fix it for you at their cost. The cost? Anywhere from $500-$1000. If THIS one broke, what makes you think I'll buy another one - especially a REFURBISHED one from you, while you cart my \"old\" one away. And then what'll happen? They'll \"offer\" the same thing to someone else and mine will become a refurbished tv to someone else. And from what I've already seen online, the refurbs don't last any longer than having a repairman fix the same one either.

We didn't try the front control panel ie (Volume, Chanel, and power buttons)until a week so later, and just because we really liked the TV we didn't bother to take it back since number one it is heavy TV for one person and it was the last one they had.  We also lack keeping our receipt safe, on October 24 when I came home I found my little 20 months old girl struggling with her iPad going through youtube videos because the TV wouldn't accept the Bluray player, I try to hook a laptop to it, it wouldn't accept either, try AV and all the HDMI ports, none of them was working. NOTE: This TV and everything is connected to surge control battery backup system just to protect them, I didn't have time to call SHARP USA till week ago, once I call they couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. One of the customer representative told me that since it is purchased from Military exchange I need to take it back there because no repair shop is authorized to mess with electronics purchased on Military base! I was like wooow SHARP is giving me another one since they don't mess with this one. Unfortunately when I called AAFES/Army Air Force Exchange store for instruction to drop it off, the manager said SHARP representatives are out of their mind. We provide only 30 days warranty and we are NOT taking it back! one disappointment, I called back the SHARP again, the 3rd time, this time I was told to fax my receipt and I didn't find the receipt. I even attempt to get it from AAFES the answer \"They keep receipts only for 90 days\" another disappointment!  It was time to go online and do some research just to find out what other customers are experiencing, of course this is a major symptom with this model and many other SHARP Televisions, unlike TOYOTA, sharp is NOT about to recall or attempt to at least help. Today we are back to market again for another larger TV definitely NOT SHARP though! Our 42\" SAMSUNG plasma is out of garage entertaining my kids as of now, Louisiana temperature goes high and drops several times a day, when it's cold plasma can replace our central heater but when it's hot, it just challenges the Air Conditioner, That's not an issue at all, this TV have never had any problem for the past over 5 years, at this point we have to do some research on other SAMSUNG 3D televisions and see if we can replace the SHARP garbage! No rushing to waste $2000.00 for what it looks like rather; this time we are taking our time to chose the right TV. Our kids have 32\" SONY Previa one each in their rooms the SHAP Garbage is just wasting our living room space as of now!  The issue mentioned above is a major and common to many SHARP models, a good indication of low quality and failure of SHARP to respond to thousands of its customers, we DO NOT recommend this TV or any other SHARP product.

The Quattron technology was super crisp, the picture was bright and clear, and we didn't notice any \"flashlight effect\" like some other reviews we read.  Watching Blue-Ray movies was impeccable!

If you even saw the toy that our son was wielding, you would be just as surprised as we were that it could do so much damage.  Also, the front glass layer is completely unharmed.  The second layer (maybe the color board?) is what broke, and when the TV is off, it looks completely fine.I understand that these TVs are quite a bit more fragile than their tube grandfathers, but the supreme fragility of the screen is not mentioned anywhere in the manual, on the website or anywhere else.
