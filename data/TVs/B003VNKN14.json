With 4 HDMI ports so connecting to other components is quick and easy.  It provides both wired and wireless options to connect to the Internet.  I opted for the wired connection for better performance.  Its Net TV comes with VUDU, Netflix and a bunch of apps and programming services which are very nice.However, its built-in \"invisible\" speakers are a major design flaw.  The sound quality is so poor that makes you wonder if they did it on purpose to force you to buy an AV system.  I also haven't been able to get closed caption on the Comcast cable channels with HDMI connection.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Major backlight bleeding", "Author": "pika2000", "ReviewID": "R26Q3VP38HXGYB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my first big screen HDTV purchase. I was so excited with this Toshiba unit as it seems to have a very good price for an LED TV compared to other brands that are more expensive. Well, I guess you got what you paid for.First of all, let's start with the goods. This TV comes with 4 HDMI ports, and its component input doesn't require a dongle like some other models. Image quality and color reproduction is pretty good after some tweaking. It also comes with a wireless USB adapter to enable connecting the TV to wifi, although I didn't use it as I have ethernet cable ready. It supports netflix, although it's a bit limited (you can only access your instant queue and pre-selected stuff. You can't do a search). The remote buttons glow in the dark, and fairly good size.Now the bad. When one buys a TV, image quality is important since, well, it's a TV. Although I think the image quality is good, this TV has a huge flaw that detracts everything good about it. It has some major backlight bleeding issue. Apparently this is a real issue with edge lit LED TVs in general, with differing significance. Mine was very bad. I have significant light spots on the lower half of the center screen and its two corners, and a bit on the upper half. It's so significant that I don't even have to be watching a dark scene video to notice it. It's worse if I watch movies with the lights off. Even with the backlight setting turned all the way down (which made the TV unwatchable in anything other complete darkness), I can still see the light spots. Build quality is a problem too as I noticed that my unit is actually bent. At first I thought it might be the stand not perfectly straight up, but no. When looking the TV from the sides, it's actually bent in the middle. Looking from the top, I can see the plastic frame is bent, and the frame surrounding the LCD panel looking poorly assembled.I thought Toshiba is a good brand, but I guess not, or I'm just unlucky. Amazon rep tried to appease me by giving me 10% back, but I don't think that's good enough for me to keep a \"damaged\" unit. I'm in the process of returning it. Hopefully it's as smooth as Amazon's regular (non-bulky) orders. I have good faith in Amazon.I'll try posting a picture of the light bleed.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "55\" Color Led Display\n1080P Resolution\n120 Hz\nUltra-Thin Depth\nUltra Thin Depth\n1080P 120Hz LED\nNet TV\nPhoto Frame Capability\nWiFi Adapter Included", "Name": "Toshiba 55UL605U 55-Inch 1080p 120 Hz Ultra Thin LED HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/316e3Q9Nb2L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003VNKN14"}}
