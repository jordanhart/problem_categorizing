But that was a mistake!  This TV displayed a \"white screen of death\" after only a total of about 20 hours of viewing time.  Unfortunately, the time had expired for me to be able to return it and am now left with another cheap TV doorstop.  I have had a similar experience with another \"cheap brand\" of TV a few years back, so this will be the last Black Friday special for me.  I will stick to Consumer Reports advice of buying a name-brand that has a good reliability record, though that is certainly no guarantee of a trouble-free product. ...but my experience has proven that it at least increases your chance of getting your money's worth.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great in a bind!", "Author": "ejones235", "ReviewID": "R28UWLT4HGS7IQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We had the hardest time finding a television with RCA and VGA inputs within our price range.
