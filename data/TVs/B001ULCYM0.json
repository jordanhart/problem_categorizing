I have compared this tv to the others with the same feed and similar settings and the samsung wins in my eyes. The colors on this tv are more vibrant then the lg ,kuro, and panny.I would say the panel and stand are a very nice glossy black with the option to swivel to some extent. The tv arrived connected to the stand which made setup very easy. The menu used to change settings is very user friendly as well. I like how you can label each input source this way it is obvious which input works with each device. The BD playback on this tv is excellent. I could go on and on.There is a B590 which inlcudes cinema smooth and a screen which is ultra filter bright plus as opposed to ultra filter bright. You will not notice the difference.BTW, I also saw this tv side by side with last years 63A650 playing same feed using same settings mode. It was not even close in my eyes.

Amazon ordering was easy and tracking my order online was very accurate on their delivery time. My tv was delivered two days before the actual delivery date from Amazon. It was ship by Pilot delivery service and they only sent one person to carry my tv from the delivery truck to inside my home. I had to help assist the delivery guy to take it out of it's packing material and place it on top of the stand. That was only thing i was dissappointed with I would suggest you call Amazon first before ordering and ask for a white glove deliver service instead. This was my first Samsung plasma Tv and I am thorougly satisfied with my order picture is wonderfull and movies on HD never looked so good on this 63\" mammoth. If your looking for the best Tv for watching sports and movies look no further. I also saved $700 dollars when ordering through Amazon compared to Best Buy and Frys Electronics. Hands down the best Plasma Samsung has ever made.

Take that and times it by 100 and you'll have the buzz emanating from the back of this monster. The picture is fantastic, but the buzz is UNBEARABLE (think 20' away at normal volume levels and it's clear as day!). Unfortunately this is a VERY common problem and if you venture over to AVSForum you'll find threads dedicated to this issue. Consensus is that the power supply is the culprit and it gets worse the more white (more power to make a white screen) you have in your picture.I managed to quell the roar by wedging a roll of scotch tape between the lower left hand side of the TV and the wall, which would seem to indicate the power supply is causing the outer housing to vibrate. Regardless, some have found this trick to work, some haven't, and some haven't had a problem at all.So all in all the picture like I said is beautiful, and with the roll of tape I'm happy as a clam. Once I have the time and once I hear people getting replacements that address and not duplicate the issue, I'll give Samsung a ring.Now that I think about it, I should call them now...I really shouldn't have to wedge a roll of tape behind my TV to make it right. Taking the buzz away from the review and I'd give this TV five starts all day long.

Was nervous about ordering a monster like this as expected trucking damage. CEVA called 4 days earlier than claimed delivery and delivered 1 hour earlier than the delivery window that day. One big guy in truck. He unloaded it onto a cart and got it into the house. I helped unpack and lift it onto the tv stand. He stayed until everything hooked up and verified it was all working before I had to sign the delivery ticket. PAINLESS:)Had not seen the 63\" in a store. Replaced a 50\" Sony rear projection. WOW what a difference. Blu-ray and over-the-air HD are phenomenol. Played the Pirates of the Caribbean last movie and the details are incredible. Great color, really dark blacks. Even cable standard definition is easily watchable but grainier on such a large screen. Absolutely no image retention - plasmas used to be susceptible to that and have been really looking for any. I am just mizing up what we watch for the break-in to reduce any chance of image retention. Watched a movie with top-bottom black bars the first night and no left over images at all. No buzzing or other screen noises. No fans. The stand does swivel and is a nice useful feature.Negatives? Well no picture in picture :(. I knew that. Why is it that none of the manufacturers make true PinP TVs anymore? Especially with such large screens. Will really miss that come football season. You can get a version of dual picture in the more expensive Samsung models but it is crude and not very useful. The screen is not a matt finish, it is very dark but somewhat glossy. So, you do get some reflections. Not a problem for me as I have window drapes for movie watching. I don't bother closing the drapes for news-weather-channel surfing. The speakers are okay but kind of tinney. You will want a surround sound system to go with this.Could not be happier with this set.

The price from Amazon was several hundred dollars less than anywhere else.  I ordered this on a Monday, and got it delivered on Friday with no problems.  TV was sent via Pilot Air Freight, and the delivery guy was extremely nice and wouuld not accept a tip.  I assisted him in getting it into the living room, where he unboxed it, plugged it in and made sure there was a picture.  He offered to take the box away, but I opted to keep it just in case....Connected my HDMI cable, and WOW!  This TV has a great picture, very bright, extreme contrast and super color.  For the price, I am extremely happy so far, and three weeks later, the set is working great!  What I am not crazy about is the sound as it emits from the bottom, and I had to turn up the highs on the equalizer to prevent the voice from being muffled somewhat.  For movies, it goes through my 1200 watt surround system, and it's like you are right there!

Chambers \"D\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZGSTMZPLSHXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I give this product 5 Stars, because I simply cannot find a thing wrong with it after about 30 days of usage. The picture is amazing and is 3D like without any drawbacks. The colors are fanstatic and there are enough controls for picture quality to keep you busy fine tuning the set if that is your preference (but it works fine at default settings). I do suggest backing off on the contrast and cell lighting though.I hesitated to buy Plasma due to most of the problems with that technology in the distant past. You have likely heard them all: Screen burn in, high power consumption and less durability than LCD. Plasma is a different ballgame now, those problems have been solved with the new plasma panels that came out recently sold by Panasonic, Samsung and LG.Out of the box this set worked flawlessly. Samsungs new plug and play setup is great and gets you going in no time.I have NOT experienced any buzzing or poping from the power supply that other reviewers have mentioned. I also find the TV speaker sound to be totally acceptable.I have this set in my home theater setup using \"basic\" cable from Comcast and it does very well on SD and HD pictures. I use the TV speakers for cable and my home theater setup for movies. I have an HK 354 AVR with Bose Speakers and a Samsung Blu-Ray player and on Blu-Ray the picture is out of this world even up close. The Samsung Blu-Ray Remote also works the TV and Vice Versa. That's a nice touch.If you are looking for a 60+ inch screen TV for a Home Theater you won't go wrong with this set and you will save some big bucks over the larger LCD/LED TV's out there.Bottom line here, if you are on the fence for a large screen TV and undecided between LED/LCD and Plasma get the Samsung Plasma. Check the prices every day they seem to fluctuate frequently and don't be afraid to buy it here.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung has great picture", "Author": "M. Vigod", "ReviewID": "R1YNNSF6I012PD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before purchasing this set.  I required a large tv between 60 and 65 inches for the space and room I was putting it in.  After reading many of the reviews and specs for this set I decided to purchase it from Amazon.Delivery went well.  Despite some things I read regarding the shipping company amazon uses to ship these monsters we experienced no issues.  The set was delivered and brought into our house and setup.  The gentleman made sure the set got a picture before he left so we had a chance to fully inspect it before we signed off.The picture on the set is amazing.  I did not make any adjustments on it and it looks great.  We did not hear any buzzing noise that some complain about. The set is quiet.One concern I did have was that there are windows in the room I was putting it in.  I read about the screen filter that Samsung applies to this set.  Despite the filter there is still a good deal of reflectivity of light on the screen.  If you have a bright room with lots of lights or windows and watch during the day this might not be the best set.  The glare is pronounced.  Fortunately for us we typically watch this particular set in the evening. The plasma looks best when the lights are completely out in the room at night.  That said you can have normal lighting and the picture is still great.  Just beware of window rooms during the day if the viewing angle puts a bright window between your eyes and the screens reflection.Overall I am very happy with this Samsung 63 plasma set.

What a beautiful television by Samsung and what a great job by Amazon getting it here quickly and in perfect condition at nearly the best price on the market (I paid $2338, no tax, free delivery).As far as pricing, I went to my local 'brick and mortar' store and saw the same exact television for $3298 and also found it online from a store that I was not comfortable dealing with for about $100 less at $2250 or so.  I had never purchased a product this large or spent this much money online before, but because of Amazon's long standing reputation for customer service and my previous experiences with them, I pulled the trigger and gave them a shot.  3 months later I couldn't be more pleased.After purchasing the television my delivery process was instantly progressing.  I received several e-mail updates and my television was in transit the next day and was delivered about three days later.  This was especially important to me because:  1.)  I was so freakin excited about my purchase that I wanted it now.  2.)  I had never spent that kind of money online and appreciated the reassurance that everything was going o.k. and moving along.When it arrived the box was upright and in perfect condition with no dents or signs that it was roughed up during transit.  The two delivery guys carried it in, unpacked it, set it where I wanted, and turned it on to ensure that it worked.  Out of the box it was aesthetically beautiful, in perfect condition, and fired up immediately and with no problem.As for performance, I'm running everything through HDMI cables which meant that out of the box I had my blu-ray, X-Box 360, and HD cable box up and running in about 1 minute or less and without problem.  So easy a caveman could do it right?  The picture is stunning, brilliant, and crystal clear no matter which component I'm running.  Simply beautiful and everything that it should be.  I can't comment about the speakers on the unit as I am running a home theater sound system but my thought is that if you're dropping $2K+ on a television, you either already have this or should be getting it next.  You really can't expect a television that is 2 inches thick to be equipped with speakers that fill the room with rich bass and clear treble.The menu interface is very easy to navigate, and customizing your settings is self explanatory as well.  I found the factory default settings to be pretty good but I did some fine tuning for personal preference and have a picture that I feel is second to none.  It is brilliant, crystal clear, and able to be viewed from all angles clearly and without distortion.  I use a universal remote, but the remote supplied is also a very nice one which is backlit and ergonomically correct.That should cover it.In closing, I read these consumer reviews everytime I make an online purchase so thank you to everyone that writes them.  Because of my outstanding experience, I felt compelled as well to share with prospective buyers how pleased I am with this product and with Amazon as a retailer.

We have since put approximately 225 hours on the panel. I had purchased the Panasonic 65s1 but canceled the order because i saw it side by side with this set at a big box store. The factors that went into my decision to get this set over the Panny were :1. The ability to fine tune the calibration. This set is not as limited as the Panny2. After getting some preliminary settings off the net and adjusting them in-store this set looked to my eye better than the Panny.3. The ability to upgrade the software from a 550 to a 590 (in the service Menu) which enables the cinema smooth feature (which is sold as a feature on the 590) is huge. ( Do some research the exact directions are on a major A/V forum).4. After doing in-depth research, it seems that the black levels which seem to be a step above on the panny regress, while the black levels on this set seem to get better.5. This set has more HDMI inputs than the Panny.6. Lastly, i did save money vs the Panny but this was the least deciding factor.Since we have had the tv in the home we have loved it. My wife\"s first words were those every man wants to hear, \"It's so big\". Ceva did a decent job delivering it in the snow, the driver did have it turned vertically on the truck, which concerned me greatly. The are several great threads which have helped me dial in my settings and help break -in this set. and for us the picture continues to get better.For viewing: Television: The shows i watch are absolutely amazing with the exception of the Digital Online Graphic that the three major networks are to ignorant to put in 16:9 aspect ratio. Fox is the only network that has the good sense to put it in the right place,(the lower right hand corner). Sports: I have watched the Super Bowl, The Daytona 500, The AT&T; Pebble Beach Pro Am,and some college basketball. This set absolutely shines and is aesthetically amazing watching sports. The shots CBS sports put up of the Ocean at the Pebble Beach Pro AM were nothing short of jaw-dropping.Movies: I am using a Sony 460 Blu-Ray also purchased on Amazon and the picture is beyond explanation. The colors in The Dark Knight,The Passion of the Christ, and any other blu-ray i have watched are as appealing as being in the theater.For it's ability to be adjusted and the plasma's known great picture ability i highly recommend this set, we at 225 panel hours are highly pleased.

Musa \"mikeE\"", "ReviewID": "R153MGUXKSD7E1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There were a lot of issues  taken  into consideration before finally deciding on this plasma TV. Extensive research through colleagues and Google was done before the  purchase of this set. We bought this unit from EastCoastTV's. At the time they had the best price offered for a brand spanking new set, plus you don't have to pay till the product is delivered and powered up. A nice option for shopping securely. Now the TV:First time we receive this behemoth, we were blown away by its picture size. Coming from a 32\" Sony tube set, the picture on this is gigantic. Nowadays, guess we adjusted to its size and don't think its that big anymore, long as we don't watch any tv that's smaller..lol.Initial set up and picture right out of the box was awesome. May be too bright for some, so tweaking to ones preference is a must. Some suggest using a video calibration brings out the total picture clarity but one can be expensive. I feel that at my previous settings, this is not needed. I set the viewing in standard mode and tried to keep the brightness, contrast, and sharpness approximately between 50-60%. Cell light I kept between 3-4.  Read somewhere that this is important during the break in period (approx. 200 hrs. total watch time)of any plasma set. Trust me, with these settings, the tv is still bright. Also tweaked the dynamic settings and occasionally use it for blu-ray. This set is is in conjunction via HDMI with a Philipps upscaling DVD player, Optimum Cable HD box, and a 250G PS3 Slim. All audio are connected through my aging 5.1 Dolby Digital, Bose Lifestyle 12 system which served us for years and still kicking major @r$e.Watched a few blu-ray on this set and its  beyond ones viewing experience. Iron Man, Dark Knight, Kingdom of Heaven, and Pirates of Caribbean Box set showed spectacular clarity. Avatar so far is the best with its vibrant colors and amazing sound. I set my PS3 to play Blu-ray discs at 60 fps. I just prefer it this way because of its true HD presentation. In my eyes, full 1080p running at 60fps attains the best picture on this set. no lag whatsoever. This tv can handle it! You can also set to watch at 24 fps to give it more of that movie theater feel. But again to each his own.PS3 games-so far I played, Red Dead Redemption, Asassin's Creed 2, Super Street Fighter 4 and yes my sons Sonic collection. The video game experience is like no other. Gaming is brought to another level when played on a big screen such as this. And did I mention 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound-Yeah baby!As mentioned earlier, concerns to consider are as most of you already read;Buzzing: this is not such an issue on my set (keeping fingers crossed). If I keep the volume on the tv above 6, its barely noticeable. When the surround sound is on, this is non-existent. Again this is only an issue when watching at extremely low volume levels.Burn-in: So far so good-no issues here(again keeping fingers crossed..lol). Seriously, I hope with today's technology such as pixel shift available on most Samsung Plasmas, this will not be an problem. Again, use common sense! Avoid non-static images and pausing a scene for long periods of time. Try to use full screen as much as possible.Heat build-up: An educated acquaintance told me of this trick. Use a fan and point the flow at the side of the set to keep the unit cool. Initially, there was heat build up that dissipated from the screen but pointing the fan helped it to be on the cool side. Now think for a moment. Heat build up and screen burn in goes hand in hand together. It's only logical to think that heat build on the screen is the culprit for a lot of burn in issues on most plasma screens. Nowadays, though the set doesn't heat up as much, I still turn the fan on in low setting for peace of mind.Kids: Lol! I came home one evening and my poor lil then 1 1/2 was in time out crying. Turns out as per mommy, he took an ice cream scoop and was about to whack the screen, good thing she blocked it on time. Whew! If you have kids who are future baseball or football players, then I suggest you invest on a screen protector. Had mines custom made out of polycarbonate material, the kind is used on police riots. Did research on that as well and it turns out, the material is so tough that even when fired with a shotgun, it didn't break. Check out the videos on Youtube for polycarbonate vs. acrylic. Screen protector is well worth the investment.If you can follow these precautions and want a big beautiful screen set with amazing picture clarity that is sure to wow you and your friends for a lot less than you would pay for an led tv, then definitely go with this plasma. You will not be disappointed.-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -Update: I added pics of this TV along my home theater.

CEVA delivery service was very professional.  They called about 15 minutes before arrival to let me know they were on their way.  Two guys brought this heavy bad-boy into my house, and we did the customary testing to confirm that it works.  It comes packaged already on its stand, and while it is quite attractive I think it is quite wobbly.  We wall mounted it above our fireplace.  Thankfully, my husband works in construction and was able to bring up a lift that uses an air compressor.  We still had to ask a male neighbor to come give us a hand to raise the TV from the floor onto the lift(I am a weakling, and was of little assistance).  We got an articulating wall mount and the part that attaches to the TV weighs about 30lbs.  There is no way that we could have lifted this TV with mounting attachment (about 145lbs.) above our shoulders to connect to the wall plate. If you plan to do the wall mounting yourself, rent one of these lifts.When the TV was on the floor, it did buzz for a brief minute.  When I heard it I grasped the top of the bezel so I could turn the set around to hear where the sound was coming from.  Then the buzzing stopped.  I let go and it buzzed again.  So I touched it in the same place, and the buzzing stopped.  It has never happened again.We are totally sold on Samsung TVs, and have purchased several (7 or 8) LCDs in the past couple of years for ourselves and family members.  This plasma set replaces an LN52A550 that we really enjoyed, but I always wanted a ginormous set.  We have a well-lit living room, but the TV doesn't directly face any windows.  Although there is some reflection on the screen it is not enough to detract from the picture.  We have not calibrated the set, but the picture is quite nice as it is.  There are some minor changes that we will make later on.  I know that LCDs and plasmas are different, but I do think that the plasma presents a richer looking picture.  My husband says it looks the same to him.  I hear there is a way to load the cinema plus feature found on the B590, and will try it out, but I don't think it that it's worth the extra few hundred dollars over the B550.  If it works fine, if not, that's okay, because my TV rocks.Our TV is connected to a 7.1 surround sound, so I cannot comment too much on the set's speakers.  We don't have cable, and the picture quality of the local OTA channels is fantastic.  The NCAA basketball games were fabulous to watch.  with this size set, you can really appreciate how tall those kids are.  We stream a lot of content through our HTPC that's connect to the TV, and games on [...] or shows on Hulu are quite nice, too.But the best viewing experience is watching blu-rays.  It rained like cats and dogs this past Sunday; which made it a perfect movie day.  We re-watched Baraka and then watched the two version of Red Cliff.  AWESOME!!!  It will be a real long time before I step into a movie theater again.There are other merchants who are selling this set with wall mount for under two grand.

This unit surpasses our other(which we paid the same price for a year anda half ago) in every way, from size, picture to out/inputs (We are using hdmi through our cabel box, our bluray player, and our xbox360 plus an optical cable for AUX audio. I would recommend utilizing all these as they make a huge difference on this unit) The touch screen controls on the console all function very well and the setup is easy to use. The contrast ratio is very high and the over all picture quality is great. It isn't as good as some of samsungs higher models such as the new LED but at the price I would choose this 63\" over a 50\" (for even more money) everytime. This is a great budget minded unit with all the bells and whistles and the perfect base for someone looking to create a home theater setup.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worth Every Penny", "Author": "J.

Fairly smooth and great colors right out of the box. Not as bright as I thought it would be, but maybe I just have to adjust the settings, brightness/ contrast. The LCD's I have seen in the store are certainly brighter. I do notice some fuzziness with fast moving objects, I thought the 600Hrtz frame rate would eliminate that. I have the HDMI froM HD cable box hooked to a Yamaha RXV 765 receiver and from there through HDMI to my TV. I wonder it that makes the difference. Overall happy with puchase.One side note, a complaint about delivery. Amazon stated this TV qualified for enhanced delivery, the carrier would deliver into room, unpack and verify it worked. I live in Minnesota. This is the reason I puchased from amazon. I actualy cancelled my order from Tigerdirect because of this. Uhmm, no luck, the carrier was one guy in a Ryder truck. He asked my wife is there was someone home who could help unload th TV, I was at work. He unloaded into garage.

Amazon started selling this set just a few months ago and has a price that beats all the local merchants, and they ship it free.  I had to wait a couple of weeks for it, but it was well worth the wait.  The shipper handled it with \"kid gloves\", air freighting it from Washington state to Hartford, CT and then trucking it to my house.  They brought it in, unpacked it, and turned it on to make sure it worked properly before they left.  I mounted it on the wall with a great mount (Sanus) that Amazon sells, and everyone who has seen it has been \"blown away\" by its performance.  The picture is very sharp and the colors just pop out at you, yielding and almost 3D effect.  The blacks are very clear and detailed, just like a great plasma set should be.  I'm sure it helps that I get a very fine picture from Dish Network, which now has a lot of HD channels available.  It also works very well (great picture) with my current DVD player, which has component video output (no HDMI). This makes me reluctant to get a Blue Ray player, because they still seem to have a lot of problems (DVD rejections and no memorized stops).

I expected same type of vividness out of this B550, but unfortunately, this one doesn't even come close.The brightness level is all off, and the color bleeds all over the screen.  After some tweaking, I concluded that the trouble is something more fundamental.  Basically we are dealing with something that cannot be adjusted via user interface.  Flesh color looks dead on the screen, and HD signal doesn't help either.Maybe they cut the cost too much this year.  Maybe 550 series was never meant to complete with A650 series.  I'm willing to give one more try with A650 plasma series from 2008, as B550 is the only item for 2009 so far.I just hope I don't have to go through too much trouble returning this TV.
