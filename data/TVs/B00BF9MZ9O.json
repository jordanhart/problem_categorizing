{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture: colors, clarity, contrast, brightness delightful. 3D is awesome", "Author": "austin_Larry", "ReviewID": "R38XGCH69BJQCY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our oldest TV went out and I was looking for a replacement. I LOVE 3D in theaters. I always have from IMAX to recent studio releases. I have a PS3 3D monitor which is small, but I love the 3D, and my must have was 3D in a replacement TV. I had never owned a Vizio before but had heard very positive reviews of them, especially the value you get.The 50 inch version of this checked everything I was looking for: good manufacturer, price, good reviews, 3D. The TV box arrived in an outer box very well packed. The stand did require 2 people and one to be on the ground cradling the set as the other worked to secure it. It was awkward and I do not see how one person could possibly do it.Appearance wise for the TV the first thing you notice is how thin the bezel is. One of the thinnest I have seen. I didn't think this would be that big a deal but it is nice when viewing not to have too much black around the picture. Speaking of the picture. Right out of the box without any adjustments it was just plain beautiful. Details on some of the kids programs we watch quite frequently brought out new textures and shades I hadn't noticed. I tweaked the brightness a little but found the stock settings great for everything I have watched so far.The 3D has exceeded my expectations. I love passive 3D. The pictures have been clean and clear and the quality of 3D is theater level. I have watched the extended edition Hobbit and Star Trek Into Darkness. The best home viewing experiences, by far, I have ever had. My PS3 is active 3D and it has lots of lighting issues and the glasses need to be recharged. Passive is much brighter and simpler with very cheap glasses.3D is available from Netflix. I have watched some Red Bull documentaries that were spell binding. If you use cable  like me and have the TV not where an Ethernet is available you might want to consider a coax to Ethernet adapter product because 3D takes up a LOT of bandwidth.I have a smart Blu-Ray player so don't use the smart apps. But if this is going on a room in the house without that then the apps can be very useful. I have tried them and they work well but connected wirelessly, which was very simple to do, quality will depend on your connection strength. There are a wide range of apps that are simple to access and add more versatility, if needed, to the TV.As my first Vizio I am very pleased. TVs seem to be priced like audio. You can get really good audio at a reasonable price and then exceptional audio at a very steep price. There are diminishing returns and the quality improvements get steeper and steeper in price. I feel almost everyone would be more than pleased with this TV. Especially if you want 3D. Vizio seems to essentially price their TVs at Black Friday prices all the time, that is the value they give you. Very few compromises here for the price. Highly recommended.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly pleased with my 1st Vizio - Excellent 3D experience - Great Smart TV features and Control", "Author": "Larry Twain \"Digital Evangelist\"", "ReviewID": "R3036JU7C1W6VG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent TV for this price point! I was searching up and down, all over the place, for a Passive 3D + Smart LED TV, >50\" in size.Most Smart TV for 50\" already price around $600-$700 during the time. And I fell on this one through Amazon's search and found it with 10% discount! and with 3D!My original choice was LG, but I found Vizio is very comparable. The software of the Smart features are great, easy to control, and you can also get an optional keyboard remote made by Vizio to control the TV (Search ASIN: B009IHHQUS).My first 3D clip on this TV, that you might surprise - is from Youtube. While I received the TV I have no 3D movie to play with, so I used the Smart TV option, and used Youtube that I found quite a lot's of 3D footage available. There are a few Youtube clips that are just to test your 3D TV so you can literally feel the objects like coming out from your TV, REAL! It was fun to see my little ones move backward when the person on the clip was pointing a stick out, like getting closer to your face. Later when he draw a knife, they ran away!The 3D viewing was pleasant and enjoyable. My 7 and 5 years old immediately fell in love. Our first movie was Despicable Me, and we can't wait for more and I was asked to get more and I got a few more from Amazon used selections. My son is in love with sea animals, so I got \"IMAX: Under the Sea 3D\" (B00447G2O8) for him and he is watching it over and over again. My daughter was like \"I thought we watched this in Disney World\". They are able to relate the experience with the 3D/4D shows in the theme park.The only drawback is the size, that it is thicker than those that price higher, but I have already realize that given to this price point. For less than Seven Hundred point, you can't beat it especially for one with 3D, and it is so hard to see a 3D TV go on sales, they just don't. Today I was in Sam's club the same Vizio WITHOUT 3D, is selling for the same price too!If you are just looking for a pure Smart TV without 3D, you have a lot others to choose. For a 3D + Smart + >50\", can't go wrong with this. If you have a growing family like me with little children, 3D TV is a must go. I have had many of my children's friends invited for a movie night and they LOVE the 3D experience.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "First Impressions", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"JMA\"", "ReviewID": "R2TG6PFMMDW7ES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV just got here today, but since there weren't other reviews of it, I figured I would say something.First, it's not too heavy, particularly not if you're only now upgrading from a cathode TV. It's definitely lighter and easier to handle than our old 19-inch cathode tube TV was. It's still best if you have two people to maneuver it, but I was able to get it onto its stand and onto the shelf myself, and I am not particularly strong.Physical set-up was fairly simple: Fasten a few screws, make sure the base doesn't wiggle, and then arrange on the stand. The TV is stable enough that I don't mind having it on a stand against the wall, although I may still switch to a stand with a mount for the TV if I get nervous about someone bumping into it. Our cats jumped onto the shelf to see what I was doing, and jumped off in terror when I turned it on, and the TV didn't even wiggle.Before mounting it on the wall or stand, it's probably wise to insert the various cords. I used an ethernet cable and one HDMI cable; there are several other options, but I haven't had need of them so far. Then plug everything in, put the batteries in the remote, grab a pair of 3d glasses, and sit in a comfortable chair.When you turn it on, the set-up is pretty straightforward. The included paper manual gets you just about this far, and then sends you to the electronic manual on the TV. That's probably a good option once you're used to the TV, but if you're the type who likes to read the manual cover to cover before you begin, you may want to download a copy and have it available for when you're clicking through the options.The remote has shortcut buttons for Amazon Instant, Netflix, and M-Go (although when I clicked on the M-Go button, the app just said \"coming soon.\") You can also hit the Vizio logo button below the number pad and scroll through a variety of other apps, or add more from their app store. The range of apps available works well for what we use (for music and radio, for instance, it has Pandora, Rhapsody, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn Radio, and possibly a few others that I didn't notice). It also has an app for HuluPlus, along with apps to the usual video sources.It's kind of a pain to browse through the various apps in the store, because each time you add one, it sends you back to the beginning. Fortunately, you probably won't need to do that very often.Even though our particular TV is set up facing some windows, I was able to watch during daylight without the glare being distracting. I would recommend setting it up out of direct light, or else hanging dark curtains, but if that's not an option, it should still be fine.The picture quality was good--not too grainy, and not blurry. I watched parts of several 3d videos via Netflix and YouTube, and the picture quality was surprisingly crisp, without jerkiness or blurriness.The sound is good, but my standards are fairly low so I make no promises that someone with more sophisticated preferences would like it equally well. But then, if someone has more sophisticated sound preferences, they probably are going to invest in separate speakers.So far, we're very happy with the television. The price was right, and the quality seems good.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Despite a major failure, within three weeks of purchase, I still rate it, best in show, for price!", "Author": "John Ratchford \"\"war baby\"\"", "ReviewID": "R3RXM84H7234YZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It,s a great TV, but, three weeks in, it quit!

This one has all the features anyone could want except a major home theater buff. The 3 D is amazing and I much prefer the inexpensive movie glasses as we have kids who lose and break things like crazy.  I don't think the quality on the others I have seen to be much if any better and then you have another expense constantly replacing.Easy set up even for this grandma (not all the wires as I let the teen do that) but setting up network and preferred settings is a breeze.  The only negative is they send you a remote without the qwerty keyboard. I had an extra so we used that and you can pick them up for about $15 including shipping on Amazon.  I usually build a couple extras ahead of time to have for damaged or lost ones. Even with the fast Amazon shipping they would be lost with even a day without a remote.  I ordered on a Saturday and got it Monday for only $15.99 shipping- great job Amazon!  My recommendation is to get a Square Trade extended warranty. They are the best. The reason I had to get another tv is Walmart botched my extended warranty purchase on the one that had issues and I have found from experience over the last two years Square Trade are cheaper, much more reliable/timely and they do what they say will do up front which the others I purchased did not.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best deal out there", "Author": "edson", "ReviewID": "R18PT53W7ZL7WV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unbeatable price, free shipping, fast deliveryAbout the tv ..... Good colors, sharp image, slim frame which gives you the feeling that you have a larger screen to view.Reason for the 4 star rating is that its webbrowser does not support flash ohterwise it could easily get a 10 star rating, for anything else that doe not require flash it does a very good job and by that i mean streaming videos off websites most of the times require flash.Also when using the remote you should slightly aim towards the bottom left corner of the tv because of the little awkward positioning of the remote sensor/receiver on the tv.Viewing movies, playing music or pictures load easily through the usb input just like a PC.Using the onscreen keyboard takes a little getting used to but the option to bookmark the websites reduces the times you have to input/type all the adresses again.The sound is very good compared to other tv's but it surely wont be better then a hometheatre set.Apps work great and are many more to download.Installation is a breeze...internet i only connect through wifi and no complaints about speed.Planning on buying a 32\" too.Oh, did i mentioned that it has 3D?? 3D movies are very pleasant to watch, like all of it is happening just in your living room....after 2months of use i still stand by the above mentioned facts...adding some more...2D to 3D converter works just fine..most depends on quality of 2D video..netflix works great..truly happy with this purchase", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great affordable 3D Smart TV", "Author": "Rusty Shackleford \"Dale\"", "ReviewID": "R49O4ATTTOSDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got the Vizio 50 inch 3D Smart TV and love it. For anyone else interested in 3DTV like myself, this is a good way to get started. You will need a 3D Blu-ray disc player, an HDMI connector, a 3D TV, and Theater 3D glasses(The Vizio E500d comes with two sets).These are the passive glasses just like at the theater, they're lightweight, cheap, and don't need to be charged.The Vizio has a super clear picture with a two million to one contrast ratio and 120 Hz refresh rate. Even regular DVD's and network broadcasts look better on this set, and I'm seeing details on Wii U and XBox games that I never noticed before.  Of course the best picture comes from 3D Blu-ray discs. So far I've seen The Hobbit and Dredd 3D discs and both movies looked amazing. For instance in The Hobbit when Bilbo runs through the shire and the camera pulls back, you see the entire Hobbit village in great depth and detail.The TV set itself looks sleek with a slim frame, it's also easy to move at around thirty pounds and less than forty five inches wide.Set-up is easy if you have a wireless connection. Within a half hour of unpacking the TV and attaching the base I was watching \"Thor\" on Amazon Prime without needing to physically connect anything but the power plug! Another neat feature for those with Amazon Prime or Netflix, there are dedicated buttons on the remote for those services.With the price of most products going up, I am thrilled with this feature packed yet very attractively priced set.

Setup was a breeze and it recognized our wireless router immediately. However, that connection was too slow for good streaming so I used the hard wired Internet connection which is built in to this set. It performs wonderfully. I have another Vizio HDTV in which I was disappointed with the sound and purchased a separate sound bar, but the sound in this one is more than adequate.One minor limitation on this set is it has limited old style connections - mostly HDMI inputs - so connecting older equipment to it requires making choices or changing connections.

This at a cost diff. from a few hundred to almost double. The 3D, color, contrast is awesome on this TV plus it is a smart TV to boot.It also has a stereo output which I use to connect my wireless headset for night watching, which the expensive LGs and Samsung don't have. They may have a headset jack but first you have to manually plugin your headset and then when you plugin something over there the speakers go mute. I leave my headsets connected and sometimes I may have them on while there may be others in the room listening through the tv speakers else I put the tv speakers on mute. This works very well on this TV as it does on my 5yr old Panasonic Plasma. Very few tv's carry this feature nowadays and you don't realize it's value unless you are missing it.It has a thin bezel and though it is not as thin as their edge lit razor line or other similar TVs, I actually wanted a backlit LED TV for better contrast and less flashlight effects. I couldn't have been happier with the purchase. Take away 1 star for no qwerty remote keyboard, no PC input (most PCs can output HDMI anyways), no 2D to 3D conversion and cannot control extent of the 3D effect, but none of them were a deal breaker for me.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV rules, remote control drools", "Author": "Michael Miller", "ReviewID": "R3FFZ9UOR9Y0DI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV itself is nothing short of glorious. I was replacing a low resolution, 54-inch rear projection TV. With a TV stand, this fit perfectly into the existing entertainment center (shelves on the side and over the TV) and brings so many new features. It's WiFi internet access spared me the trouble of running a cable awkwardly across a hallway. Its Netflix and YouTube apps are perfect for my needs, and I've made some use of the YouTube weather and movie notices. It makes great use of HD cable channels; seeing them on a TV this big is a revelation. The cost was about the best in the class of 50-ish HD LCD TVs. Everything about this TV is great except...The remote control.Wow, this thing drives me nuts. I don't know if it's the location of the receiver on the TV or the remote or something in between, but reception is horrible. I often have a command two or three times to get the TV to respond (and, yes, I pause between button-mashing to see if the first button push worked). It takes several tries to get the volume to respond, several tries to get the Netflix movie controls to work (\"Ha-ha, you wanted pause THEN? No, you get a pause after the cool scene in the movie!\"), and several tries to switch between inputs.The last TV, that dated rear-projection, 20th Century monster, could see remote control signals bounced off all the white-painted walls in the family room. So could my cheap little college CRT TV - I could point the remotes 180 degrees away from the TV and get a quick, snappy response. This modern thing needs you to adopt weird yoga poses before it refers your remote control commands to a committee for consideration.All that falls under the category of \"first world problems,\" hence the 4 stars. The TV is great. The picture is great. The features are great. For a 50\" HD LCD LED TV, the cost was great.

Easy to set up and streaming is clear and crisp.TV - Looks great, amazing picture and very little glare compared to coming from a Samsung Plasma.3D - I love the passive 3d this TV has. Coming from active 3d I thought for sure it wouldn't look as good, have crappy viewing angles or something along those lines, but after watching a couple of movies I actually like passive better. No clunky glasses and I don't have to spend an extra 50-100 bucks per pair to enable everyone to watch. Only thing I miss is the 2d-3d \"up conversion\".Gaming - Games look just as good on this TV to me as they did on my plasma. Blacks are a little less dark, but unless you're an uber videophile nerd, it's not worth the extra money.Cons -Youtube app is pretty crappy unless you run it from your phone.The remote is TERRIBLE. You have to have it pointed directly at the sensor almost (though that could be the sensor) and the dedicated amazon button doesn't work. I have to hit the Vizio button and scroll to the amazon app to run the video. This is a big deal for me as I use Prime a LOT more than I do Netflix. The button worked once initially and hasn't worked since.Documentation is CRAP. I am a fan of the digital world, but good God, you need to include something explaining how to use the remote and go through basic setup. It's not as straight forward as some other brands out there, especially since it requires you to create an account to do -anything- including watch basic TV.Vizio's support site is severely lacking, which is a big deal for me considering how poor my experience was with my Samsung and it dying after only two years. When I try to register the TV they don't even list this model on their site despite it being released THIS YEAR. Thankfully I learned my lesson and bought a Squaretrade warranty so it shouldn't be a big deal...Except I had to list the TV as \"other\" and enter the model number as Squaretrade doesn't have it listed either.

For our smaller version, we just turn it off if it's doing it for a show (it doesn't sound as good though with it off).

When I purchased this TV from Amazon, I got an amazing deal.  Based on the price, it was a steal.  At Amazon's current listed price ($739 as of 12/10/13), I'm not so sure that it's as great of a deal as what I got.  But as far as the product itself, it's a good television.  The picture is great and it's as good (and better in some cases) as some of the big name televisions, but for a fraction of the price.  I generally purchase Samsung televisions, but after a good experience with this television, I have no qualms with buying another Vizio in the future.I only have a couple gripes.  First, the remote.  The remote is garbage.  It feels flimsy.  For an television of this caliber, I'd expect a more sturdy and reliable remote.  Also, I experience delays when I attempt to do something as simple as increasing the volume.  It seems like I have to press the volume button a couple times to \"wake it up\", at which time it functions normally.  It's not a battery issue either.  Also, the Vizio button functions as the menu button for the smart TV functions such as accessing Netflix, Hulu, etc.  Often times I have to press the Vizo button twice to get it to execute the smart menu.  The only other complaint I can think of is the television sometimes reboots for seemingly no reason.  There's been occasions when I'm doing something simple like changing the input and I'm greeted with the Vizio logo which implies the television has just started.  I haven't discovered a reason for this yet.Overall, for the price and for what you get with that price, I'd have no hesitation buying this again even with it's quirks.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "wow", "Author": "S.

I replaced an old Poloroid 46 inch TV with this and the Poloroid had better sound. I guess most manufacturers now a days are doing this on purpose to force you to buy their sound bars and etc. This TV is extremely light, we bought a mount that was meant for 37-55 inch TV's but I feel fairly confident that a mount meant for smaller TVs could have been used. The picture quality is OK, I think Samsung still look much better. My friends Samsung does the 120hz and with that, you can see more detail, I don't get that affect with this Vizio TV though, even though it is 120hz. I'm not taking anyth stars off for that though, because it might be some setting that I haven't discovered yet, or maybe his only displays that way because of a special setting he has on his Samsung, that Vizio TV lacks. I know 120hz should allow me to view more frames, however, I don't see the difference like he does, using the same input hardware (a PS3 with HDMI).

Vizio calls and markets it as \"Smart Dimming.\" I notice the effect sometimes when the scene changes quickly, though I leave it on simply because I like the deeper blacks. The colors are vibrant and fantastic with a bit of tweaking.Although I'm unable to get a straight answer, this TV is likely not a full array LED. The viewing angle on this TV isn't anything to brag about either.BuildThe thin frame really makes the picture stand out. The TV is also surprisingly light. I was able to handle it, lift it up, and move around by myself.SoundNot much to talk about here. Didn't get this TV for the sound but I didn't find it terrible or too much of a \"thin\" sound. Hooked it up to my Vizio soundbar and it worked almost flawlessly. One issue I had is after hooking it up to the soundbar I noticed that the audio went out of sync. I was surprised to find an audio delay setting in the menu which easily fixed the problem (I had to crank it up to 3).3DI tested a variety of sources, including Bluray 3D, Netflix 3D, 3D Youtube videos, and 3D movies from the PC. All worked great! I noticed a lot of ghosting/crosstalk at first, but I realized I had to be positioned just about center and eye level with the TV to eliminate the issues.AppsI've only extensively tried Netflix and Youtube and both work great. Using the remote to type is very difficult and annoying. Luckily, I can control my list for Netflix on a PC and pair my smartphone to the TV for Youtube for easy navigation (the smartphone app can get a bit buggy sometimes).I couldn't confirm it online anywhere, but the Netflix app on this TV offers both SUPERHD and 3D! And the Netflix app is fully fleshed out with profiles and the kids version.I also set up the Amazon app, but it seems severely underdeveloped and unintuitive.----------------If you're budget-minded and in the market for an excellent 2D HDTV that offers a decent 3D picture and Smart TV capabilities, this TV is probably one of the best at the moment.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Internet connection works great, Amazon videos play over WiFI with no problems", "Author": "j marcus hollis", "ReviewID": "RSFCRSPGB9VRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would definitely buy this product again.

I watch a lot of soccer, and I play a lot of FIFA on my Xbox. The main problem I've had is that when the camera pans the width of the field there is serious motion blur. I also feel like nothing is ever in focus with this TV, everything seems to be blurry if there is even the slightest bit of motion. The other problem I have is that when the there is motion I can also see a gray haze in different areas. I'm assuming this is caused by the LEDs, but it's very annoying (I'm actually watching hockey as I'm typing this and the gray haze and motion blur are ridiculously noticeable). I've also had serious issues with tiling that I wouldn't expect from a 120hz refresh rate. I did an online chat with Vizio customer service and their recommendations helped slightly but there are still serious problems with my TV. Based on other people's reviews I may have a defective set, but Vizio customer service didn't mention anything about it.I also have a 5-year old 37in Samsung LCD that has a better picture than this TV with none of the motion blur or the gray hazy areas. Over the past 5 years if anyone asked me what brand to look at for a TV I would always recommend Samsung. I made the mistake of not listening to my own recommendation. My mom has a 55in Panasonic Viera plasma TV, and I wish I had saved my money for one of those or a Samsung. I would not recommend this TV to anyone.
