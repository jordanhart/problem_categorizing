Amazon Tech Support is A #1 !!!I honestly would NOT buy Philips brand ANYTHING unless it's thru Amazon.com. Philips has ZERO customer concern and does not even attempt to fix any problems with any of their products! Philips simply tries to give it's customers excuses, delays, and hopes you just give up dealing w/ them and go away.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Philips 32 Wi-fi TV", "Author": "handywoman", "ReviewID": "R3DRV8OVONNJPM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV had all the features that we were looking for and we use this in a bedroom. Picture is good from all angles and the sound is excellent. Apps and Wi-Fi are good too. Have yet to download and utilize the special Phillips PC (computer capability). The only Con for me is having to Navigate through the remote control features to set the sleep timer. Was spoiled by our previous JVC TV, it had a direct button on the remote for sleep timer.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$329.99", "Features": "Connect a PC or MAC to a TV wirelessly with WirelessConnect\nOne button access to wireless NetTV services on your TV\nBrilliant LED images with low power consumption", "Name": "Philips 32PFL4908/F7 32-Inch 60Hz LED TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310Z-9pa4SL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BG5C9DO"}}
