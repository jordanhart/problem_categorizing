They work great for a few months, then the screen goes blank!  It has happened to many, many people, including me!  There is no technical help or customer service from Coby! No matter what kind of a warranty you have! They have an F rating from the Better Business Bureau! Buyer Beware!", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect set for the office", "Author": "Mark S. Koehler", "ReviewID": "R3BIZEJZKVLRYJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this COBY TF-TV1912 as a replacement for the Haier 15HL25S that died just days after its warranty expired.  And this set is far superior.  It has good sound from its internal speakers, excellent picture quality, and virtually every input I need to hook my accessories to it.  I don't have any HD equipment, so the missing HDMI interface was not important in my selection.I am pleased with the quality of the picture when viewing DVD's via the component interface.  The widescreen format is great viewing without those annoying bars on a 4:3 aspect ratio only set.It works well as a PC monitor.  I run at 1024x786 and the image is great.The only downside I have noticed so far is that the tuner is not as sensitive as the external DTV converter box I have.  Even with an amplified indoor antenna, it will not pick up all the local channels reliably.  Hence, I will keep my cable connection.I wish the zoom/crop format option would work in all modes, but apparently that feature only works with DTV mode.I have not tried hooking the set directly to the raw cable yet to see if it will decode the unscrambled QAM signals. I view my cable programs via the DVD recorder interface and the digital cable box.But, overall, this is a good unit, and seems to be well built.  The angle of view is excellent also, you don't get that 'wash out' or 'false color' as on the older LCD screens.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00196BE6S"}}
