{"Reviews": [{"Title": "TV Fails only 8 months after warrany expires", "Author": "Sengakuji", "ReviewID": "R3KYWFLAECN2BQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yeah the TV worked great when it was working. 8 months after the warranty expired, it went kaput! As far as I'm concerned the Sanyo DP42849 is an inferior product of crappy quality.  Evidently this problem is happening to many owners of this useless piece of garbage.  One day you turn on your TV, the power light comes on, but no picture or sound.  What has happened is that the power management board (PN# DPS-260LP) has failed.  I tried to negotiate with customer service, yeah it's 8 months out of warranty but come on!  Is it too much to ask that my TV not die in less than 2 years?  Is 5 or 6 years too much to ask?  This problem will cost you well in excess of $200! (price of part, tax, delivery and installation) When I called Sanyo support..you're not gonna belive this \"..yes sir, I understand your frustration.\" .. See Beavis & Butthead \"Tech Support\"  What I finally got from Sanyo Support essentially sums up to \"Your warranty's expired, you ain't gettin' diddly from us! Just piss off and go away!\"  Ordering the replacement part from Sanyo parts department is just as unpleasant.  I said that $170 + 10 shipping was a rip off!  \"Well sir, you're welcome to buy your part from someone else!\", that's the response I got! That condescending old hag knows full well that I can't find that part anywhere else?  I know because I wasted hours and hours on the internet trying to find one. Seems that everybody's out of stock. I'll never buy any of Sanyo's crap ever again!Update: if the power management unit fails, it's quite likely that it fried your screen/panel.  At that point you're better just putting it out on the curb and buying a new TV.  I got a VISIO! Over a year and a half..still chuggin' away.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sanyo DP42849 TV", "Author": "beckiraye", "ReviewID": "R393JAN46CRBAC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tv seemed nice for a while. It lasted 1 and 1/2 years. It just went out one day. The green light comes on and that is it. The tv repairman said it will cost me $100 just to look at it.And if it is the power supply that is another $100. But it could be other things. After reading many reviews on this tv it seems to be a piece of crap. Thanks Sanyo. Never will I buy anything with your name on it. I will also look for companies  you are affiliated with and not buy their products either. A tv set should last more than a year and half. If I could give this tv and company minus stars I would..'", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sanyo is SCAMMING Customers BIG TIME!", "Author": "Surfer Girl 27", "ReviewID": "R1JM017PJGWDMT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought a Sanyo 47 inch LCD TV from Walmart less than 1 year ago & it kept turning off randomly for no reason.  We just dealt with it for awhile, but tonight my husband & I read TONS of reviews about other Sanyo TV's doing the same thing, & worse - turning off & staying off & not working at all!  I saw this & read it to my husband who said, \"At least we don't have that problem.\"  Minutes later, we did.  Our TV just turned off & won't go on anymore.  NEVER buying anything Sanyo again, and I cannot believe they do not care anything at all for their brand name.  Don't believe me?  Just Google Sanyo TV problems, you'll see thousands of complaints, with NO response or help from Sanyo.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV", "Author": "Jase", "ReviewID": "R2CKZU3YAZTA7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned my Sanyo for 3 years and its been a great TV.
