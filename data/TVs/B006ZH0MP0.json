It arrived after ordering through Amazon in 4 days with white glove installation services. We are very impressed with this TV after owning it now for 5 days.Pros 4 out of 5 stars:Nano full array LED backlightingMagic Motion remote with motion control, voice recognition, dedicated apps button, dedicated 3d button. This remote's motion is much more accurate than the Nintendo Wii.Dual Core processor provides very quick responses to input selectionPassive 3D using FPR with no observed crosstalk or image distortion6 pairs of 3D glasses includedLG apps and the Appstore5mm Bezel is amazing, the image looks like it floats because the TV border is so slimLightweightGood viewing angles, brightness and contrast ratios (blacks look black not grey)Image looks great with no glaring faults **Edit 7/7/2012, second TV exhibited glaring 24p motion trailing faults, see below for more info**Cons (docked 1 star due to the following):Price: $3299 at release at the time of reviewNetwork key settings not saved between TV power off cycles (power button on remote, not unplugged from surge protector).Semi-glossy coating is reflective in living rooms with a lot of ambient lightLG appstore requires an account creation3D audio/video was out of sync when watching Alice in Wonderland 3D with my Sony Blu-Ray Home Theatre system BDV-E780W. I tried messing with the settings for AV sync in Settings->Audio but could not get the audio to match the video. (You would hear a person talk before their lips were seen moving). Nothing I tried fixed it completely but was able to get the delay down to under half a second. BTW: My TV is up to date using the network update function. This is related to 3D only, switching to 2D does not have sync issues. I am using HDMI 1.4 spec cables.***EDIT 7/7/2012: We contacted Amazon and exchanged the TV for another LM9600 due to the network key not saving between power-offs. The second TV had the same issue, so I contacted LG (they couldn't figure it out) and did some logical thinking and troubleshooting and found that the problem is that the Network SSID has spaces in the pre-fix part of the name and when the TV would try to save the name it was incorrectly formatting it and thus searching for an SSID that doesn't exist. I changed the SSID of my network and it started saving correctly. However, the second TV exhibited performance issues that the first did not. Namely the 24p issue where there are noticeable motion trails when people wear black and are moving relatively quickly. I noticed this when watching Harry Potter 7 part 2. There is a scene where students wearing black are going down a spiral staircase and the blurring was so noticeable it was distracting. At first I thought it was a camera effect but realized that it was not when watching on a different TV. We have since returned the TV altogether and got a Panasonic 60\" GT50 for a LOT better price and a significantly better picture quality. Honestly, my wife and I feel it is a huge upgrade. ***", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best LG I have ever owned!", "Author": "Marty Gillis", "ReviewID": "R20NMVUGRJDSMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG LM 9600 is currently the flagship for LG, unless you can spring for a $12,000 OLED or a $20,000 Ultra HD (4K) set.  I will admit here and now to being a real fan of LG LCD/LED TV's and own 4 of them including the 9600.I have wanted to own this TV since it was first announced but I just couldn't swing the initial almost Four Thousand dollar price. YIKES! Since LG has just announced their 2013 line-up, the 9600 has come down in price dramatically and once it hit the 2K mark I had to bite.  I am not willing to worry about burn-in, buzzing and a higher power bill (Plasma) and am sensitive to \"Rainbows\" (DLP)so a LCD/LED set is really my only choice.  I can't afford a Sharp Elite so it was down to either THIS TV or the Sony HX950.  In the end I choose LG again and it was partly due to price but mostly due to my continuing good luck with the brand and liking the large amount of control over the video.I have ZERO interest in the \"Smart TV\" features and honestly wish the manufacturers could concentrate on giving us a more \"Perfect\" TV picture instead of all the bells and whistles.  As such, my review is basically about picture quality and associated issues.  I do admit to TRYING the browser and the performance is MUCH snappier than the 7600 since this set has the dual core processor. It is still slow as a slug compared to even the most basic Windows 7 PC.  I like the almost infinite amount of picture control and the ability to enjoy my PAL DVD collection played upconverted at it's native 50hz with no frame rate conversion.This TV is nicely built and looks great. I am pushing 60 and could assemble it and set it up by myself although it was a bit of a workout.  Screen IS a bit reflective but for me it is a non issue as my viewing environment is purposely dark.  I use a bias light mounted behind the TV which lowers viewing fatigue and increases perceived contrast and black levels and it also significant lowers any perceived flash-lighting that may exist.  The 9600 does NOT have the best black levels you can get, but with proper set-up and calibration and a bit of care you can coax a REALLY good picture out of it.My only actual complaint regarding the build of this TV is the idiotic inclusion of a chrome trim strip that runs the length of the front bezel. Yes it is small, but it is HIGHLY reflective and a royal pain the rear for anyone wanting to watch without the distraction of annoying glare emanating from the bezel itself. Dumb choice, on par with the new Sony stand. (makes you wonder if the designers even WATCH these things)Comparing the 9600 to my other LG's (6200, G2 and 7600) I can honestly say it is the absolute BEST of them all.  Nice bump in picture detail for HD sources, especially 1080p Blu Ray or HD DVD media.  It is just plain sharper and clearer than any LG I own (after calibration) and has the best on-board sound of any of them as well.The increase in perceived resolution can be a double edged sword as the 9600 is somewhat unforgiving with highly compressed SD cable broadcasts and poorly mastered DVD's.  There is plenty of on-aboard processing to help you deal with that and a good Blu Ray player such as an Oppo will go a long way towards massaging poor video before it even hits the 9600. If you feed it a pristine 1080p high bit rate/nicely mastered Blu Ray it will really shine.  I truly believe that 55 inches is pushing it size-wise even for 1080p but from my centered viewing distance of about 6 feet it looks VERY nice and totally involving while watching movies.I have not personally had a problem with 24 frame material, but judder seems to be a problem unless the Tru Motion is engaged. Like almost everyone else, I personally HATE the \"Soap Opera\" effect but find that setting the \"Blur\" and \"Judder\" controls to just \"1\"can alleviate the judder without introducing unwanted video artifacts. If anything, setting it to \"1\" gives you a bit more clarity and the sideways motion is just a little bit unnatural looking, but judder is gone so I will live with it. If you have to have absolute natural motion, LCD is probably not for you anyway.Out of the box the picture quality is just not very good. (unless you enjoy a combination of \"Flame Mode\" with a healthy dose of \"Soap Opera\" thrown in for good measure)  LG requires calibration to look it's best, but you will be rewarded with a much better than\"average\" HD picture afterward.  I use a combination of Speers and Munsil , HD Video Essentials, and the AVS forum calibration discs.You can search many online forums for good starting points but your own settings will reflect your source components. (ie: your Blu Ray player, DVR, etc.)  Once dialed in, the 9600 will totally rock-n-roll!!  Honestly, once properly calibrated, even basically, this thing will knock your socks off. A HUGE step up from my 7600. My friends and family have seen me go thru 9 HDTV's in the last 7 years and as sick as they are at looking at my latest TV each and every one of them was impressed with the 9600's picture quality.  As far as I am concerned, until OLED or Sony's much ballyhooed \"Crystal LCD\" is perfected AND comes way way down in price THIS is the TV I will watch.LG has seemingly skimped on actual dimming zones with this model but in reality this new design eliminates one of the worst problems associated with a full local dimming panel and that is HALOS......  I have ZERO halos on this panel which makes it a real step up from most other full LED backlit TV's.To extract the very best picture from this beastie, you will need to go against your old ways of dong things just a bit and set the backlight quite a bit lower than you would think you need. In my case, in a darkened environment I have calibrated the LM9600 using a base backlight setting of \"30\" and a 2.2 Gamma which gives me wiggle room in case I run across a DVD or Blu Ray that was mastered too light or dark.  (You simply put up or down your Gamma to solve any brightness or darkness problems temporarily. Then just switch it back to 2.2 for everything else.ALSO, if you set your local dimming to \"HIGH\" you can achieve almost plasma-like blacks while avoiding all the pitfalls of plasma.  The only defect in my 9600 is a slight amount of flashlighting in the lower right hand comer. It is not bad unless the program material is solid black in that corner, then it sticks out like a sore thumb. But using the Local Dimming on HIGH and keeping the backlight at 30 it still gives me plenty of dynamic range between the contrast and brightness controls and I can enjoy a nice bright and dynamic picture with plenty of pop and very deep blacks and the added bonus of MINMAL flashlighting! (almost none in fact) That type of calibration also helps greatly with perceived banding by the way. The screen is never clipped and your whites are white, blacks are black and there is plenty of thick rich contrast between them. Color pops more too as a result, as does fine detail in faces and objects. The only REAL area where the 9600 falls a bit short is you must sacrifice just a small amount of shadow detail to get everything else in line.  I can live with that, it is PRETTY darn close to what I want in a TV.  I just watched the 'Alien' Blu Ray and thought I was viewing a high end plasma, only brighter!  NICE!Now for the downside:  The 9600 (and EVERY OTHER LCD/LED out there including the $5000 plus Sharp Elite) suffers from varying degrees of Flashlighting, Horizontal Banding and Dirty Screen Effect.IT is important to note that ALL LCD/LED TV's, whether they be edge lit or full LED backlit with local dimming have these \"problems\" .  They are directly related to the technology used and the actual construction and design of the panels themselves.  To avoid these issues, go with Plasma or DLP, although both of those suffer from their own video anomalies.It really boils down to WHICH set of unwanted artifacts you are willing and prepared to live with when watching your television. There is currently NO SUCH THING as a perfect TV and once you realize this and accept it you can adjust your expectations accordingly. I have had to do so, reluctantly, but at least I can find some degree of happiness with the current offerings.  For me, the LG LM 9600 has way more positives than negatives and gives me overall the very best picture of any television I have ever owned in my more than 55 years of watching.My flashlighting is limited to a very small area on the bottom right corner. It is VERY small and a non issue for me. Banding is also MUCH LESS than any LCD/LED I have owned so far.  While viewing an episode of \"Frozen Planet\" to test for banding, I found it is only really noticeable during those horizontal pans when a solid light background is displayed. (no surprises there eh?) And even then, it has perhaps 85% LESS banding than my LG 7600. Proper calibration, including a judicious use of your backlight control can work wonders in minimizing the dreaded banding and also go a long way towards eradication your \"Dirty Screen Effect\"....... I decided to watch \"Fargo\" to see if the amount of banding and dirty screen effect would interfere with the enjoyment of the movie. It didn't, and I am way too picky for my own good. Again, compared to the other LG models I own, this one has the unwanted artifacts down to a minimum. I am not saying the 9600 is better than any other tech or brand out there as one size does not fit all when it comes to TV's, but the overall flexibility of LG's control/processing system coupled with the plethora of web features, the more than acceptable passive 3-D and the built in Media Player  gives you a whole lot for your money, considering the the current asking price! (around 2 thousand)AND YES, there is a bit of a \"panel lottery\" going on with this model but you are going to find that with EVERY brand and Model. Even the Sony HX950 can have major banding problems as seen in a customer review posted here on Amazon. Unfortunately it is really a hit or miss proposition and no brand is immune.  Build quality and quality control in general is suffering lately across the board. Phooey!For less than half the price of the Elite I am VERY happy with the LG LM9600. It is the most money I have ever spent on a television and admit to being just a bit disappointed that you can not buy your way out of Banding and Dirty Screen Effect with LCD displays but looking at things objectively I do think the 9600 is a great buy for Two Grand.....*** see the comment section for some semi incoherent ramblings about my efforts in trying to extract the best possible picture from this TV.....", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "55LM9600 - A Great Looking TV with Great Features, But with One Huge Fundamental Flaw", "Author": "system accezz", "ReviewID": "R1NNRTIRUR176C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV a few weeks ago and have been testing it with a variety of contents since receiving it. I had a LG 55LV9500 Full Array LED prior to this TV, which had pretty good black levels. First the positives and negatives.PositivesDecent black level - not even close to my previous TV thoughAmazing 3D quality - best I have seen yet, with almost zero crosstalk. Also more comfortable than Active 3d since I do wear eyeglasses.Playback of Media files via DLNA is great - DTS support is included!Great looks - best looking TV I have seenNo Haloing effects - this was very present in my previous TV, looks like LG fixed that issueExcellent menus and SmartTV functionalityNegatives24p playback flaw - see comments below!Some vertical banding present - very evident when spanning across a landscape or when watching sportsNon-uniform screen - some clouding in the bottom right and upper left - even with Local Dimming activated! Evident in wide screen movies in the black barsSome of the apps are not accessible - e.g. MLB.TV app has a Coming Soon placeholder.Only One Remote included - No original remote included with this TV, only the Magic Motion oneFinal Comment:After a few weeks of use, this TV is going to go back to Amazon. The main reason is the flaw with playback of 24p content. This was seen in the European models prior to its arrival here and it looks like it is also present on NA models as well. There are motion trails seen especially in dark scenes, which lead to a very degraded picture, not to mention it being annoying as well. I have seen it in a few movies as well as episodes of The Walking Dead and Falling Skies. Playback of the same scenes in 60hz has no such issues however.For the price, the TV is definitely not worth it at the moment in my opinion. However, if the 24p issue is ever fixed and the price is lowered a bit, I believe that the TV would become a great addition to anyone's household.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Impressive 3D TV with some flows", "Author": "Sameh Farid", "ReviewID": "R271GDP2BK137V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, after lots of hesitation, I bought this LG 55\" over the Samsung 8000 which was 30% more expensive.The looks: 10 out of 10 score. It looks really nice: So slim, the chrome frame and stand are very high quality and really impressive.Picture Quality is fantastic. 3D is better than the Samsung but I think the Samsung is better in 2D HD mode. I liked the color tones of the Samsung better. Both of them are 480 Hz refresh rate so they are great for fast sport and action movies. LG was able to generate darker black but Samsung generate brighter silver color. It seems this LG nono LED technology is good, ...although my very old Pioneer Plasma TV is much better in old SD content (but not HD for sure). 9 out of 10 score2D to 3D surprisingly works to some extent on HD 2D content. I thought this was just a marketing gimmick. But I think I will use it frequently on the sports games. 2 bonus points!Sound Quality: Wow, how did they get this sound out of these tiny down firing speakers at the bottom of TV. Anyway, it is unlikely that I will use them anyway. 11 out of 10 !Smart TV functions: Mostly useless. The dual core CPU is too slow and the TV can't stream from internet fast enough, it will keep pausing to buffer every minute or two (see other reviews on this). Even streaming standard low res Youtube content is interrupted. If you have Apple TV, Ruku, you will not use this feature anyway. This was a nice try from LG to replace the need to a streaming device like Ruku. I was very disappointed !!  -5 points !Skype: Once you try to use it it will ask you to buy the LG Camera sold at $239 here on Amazon and everywhere. No other Camera will work. I'm confident that LG makes more money on this $10 camera than the whole TV. A quick look on the net shows that these camera's are liquidated in Australia at $44. I was about to order one when I remembered how slow was the Internet. Video on Skype requires good bandwidth, which LG would not support.I find it irritating that LG advertise Skype as supported on their Smart TV's but they never say you need to pay $250 extra if you want to use it !!!  I took a star off because of this cheatInputs/ Outputs: 4 HDMI and 3 USB with digital Audio out: I think I will now use the TV to switch between my different video sources rather than the AVR receiver. I have lots (300)of HD 2D and 3D movies on a small 1TB hard-disk that is now attached to the LG. The LG USB port does not supply enough power to run the disk. You need to use a disk that has another power supply of a flash USB. I was going to replace my great 8 yrs old Rotel receiver to get latest HDMI support, but now I can keep this beast where the sound quality is far much better than the commercial Denon and OnkyoRemote: My set came with both remotes: The traditional and magic remote. I'm a computer engineer so I had no problem getting used to both real quick. I like the magic remote more than the traditional one.Now I come to the killer point, I have the famous annoying light clouds at 3 of the 4 corners. It does not show except if you dim the room and a watch some very dark 16:9 content where the upper and lower parts of the screen are left blank (and black). I'm really annoyed, but I will live with it...as I can't get another high end TV for $1250Conclusion:This is a very good value for $1250, but certainly not for $2000 or $3000If you have a tight budget and want to make a compromise between size of the TV and Refresh rate, Choose the size over the refresh rate. I could not see any difference in picture quality between 240Hz and 480Hz. I could see some slight difference when compared with 120 Hz. Buy size of screen make huge difference if you want to watch 3D.Discard most of these smart TV functions when you make your decision on all TV's. Buy an apple TV, Ruku , Boxee. I wish LG saved that $200 spent of the Smart hardware and internet connection and gave it back to me in price reduction.You are essentially buying the LED panel and the video processing hardware. Focus your decision on theseAlmost all TV's have some flows on the LED panel some flaw's causes some large or very small bright cloud spots on corners. You may want to check the unit quickly when it arrives.Finally, if you don't watch lot of HD content and most of the sources you watch are standard definition (DVD quality) then you are much better off with high end plasma at half the priceI hope I have helped you in your buying decision like these reviewers who helped me through the years", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Took some settings tweaks...", "Author": "WildDragon", "ReviewID": "R2UPCA838CENPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV was a gamble based on other reviews, but I'm glad I made the purchase. The 3D quality and adjustment capabilities are great.

I am currently running my PC on 720P instead of 1080P because of the input lag. Once switched to 720P all the lag is removed and it works great. I'm not sure if this is because of the TV or because of my older video card (GTX 280).

There are a number of other sites that have given this set high marks, but based on the inconsistency of reviews, I think the bigger issue is QA at LG.I picked this set up for $1300 - FAR below the original MSRP and still well below current asking prices.  For that money, this set was a steal.  I compared it to a number of other sets, and the only one I felt was markedly better was 3X the price.  I am a plasma fan, but with 4 young children running around the house and using the TV for everything from Sponge Bob to Lego Star Wars, I didn't want to deal with the weight, heat, and image retention issues.  I wanted the relative simplicity of LED/LCD.The strong suite of this set is color - it is the closest I could come to plasma color without a plasma set.  I don't see any issues that I have heard about in other reviews.  Shadow detail is impecable and motion is as smooth as can be.  Black levels can be vexing;  you have to almost treat it like a plasma from a brightness perspective - it is capable of extreme brightness, but you'll compromise black performance as a result.  Note that it took me a LONG time to get my settings to the point where I wanted them.  The CNET settings are an absolute joke.  I found some on an Asian site and tweaked those for my best results.  Depending on my source, I switch between a couple of different modes.  The TV is easy to configure and the remote is an absolute breeze, devoid of the myriad of buttons that plague some remotes.  It's basically a wireless mouse with more buttons.  The configuration interface is great and the interface for apps is \"good\"; not the best but not the worst by a long shot.  Everything is easy to find, and navigation is straightforward.  I prefer using the VUDU and Amazon apps on the set vs. my PS3 for this reason, and the PS3 isn't exactly hard to use.  I'd say DLNA setup was easy, but that would be understating it.  It just happened once I put it on the network.  I can stream from my NAS without issue.I'm happy with this set for what I paid for it.  Had I paid twice the price, I wouldn't be disappointed, but probably not as enthusiastic.  I feel strongly that a number of these sets that left the LG factory had issues; i know that the 24P issue was subsequently resolved with a firmware upgrade that my set already had.  Still, it would go a long way to explaining some of the poor reviews.  Factor in the $3300 release price, and you have a recipe for angry customers.

This TV is truly one of a kind.The magic remote's voice command needs to be improved. But comparing it with Samsung ES8000 remote's voice command, both are the same. I like the pointer thingy when you shake the remote. It helps me a lot to browse the page and the pointer is gone pretty fast, about less than 3 seconds, if no activity. Which is good, because you don't want the pointer hangs too long on the screen while you are done selecting.I love the design as well. Btw, I have this TV with stand. It looks gorgeous. The TV has glossy screen. There is no light behind me as I watch the TV nor on the top of the TV. So, there is no light reflection while watching.To conclude,Goods:picture qualityrich black level (with proper set up, google it)amazing 3D experiencegorgeous designCons:remote's voice command (as I am writing this the 2013 models have improved voice command)glossy screen (not a big thing, with a proper lightning set up or as to where to place the TV)", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Amazon Customer Service was better than the LM9600", "Author": "RPL", "ReviewID": "R1QJ2654EUSWLZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I opted for this model after evaluating the features and comparing against (Samsung ES8000 and Sony XBR929) and spending time going through multiple HDTV forums, product review sites and going through Amazon product reviews.  There are many flaws with this model but the two that stand out are the backlight problems which includes the uneven lighting of the screen and flashlighting (it does seem like holding a flashlight on the corners) which is widely discussed in TV forums; the other flaw is with the image ghosting when there's fast movement on the screen and dark scenes which is just unacceptable on a supposed 480Hz system built to make movement smooth and clean.  The ghosting effects can be minimized (but not fully eliminated) by turning off all image processing options like TruMotion and Noise Reduction.  We're out of luck for the screen uneven backlight which is a bit irritating when watching in a dark room.  I requested for a replacement and received a unit which had slightly less backlight problem.  The flashlight problem was just as bad but the backlight was slightly more consistent than my previous unit -- it seems to be an actual product quality control issue.  A few forum postings indicate users receiving a good unit while others complain.On the plus side, the screen and colors are really nice especially for bright scenes and the 3D works out well and I prefer the passive 3D glasses.  It is convenient that Netflix and Hulu are supported directly, I wish it included the Amazon Video player too so I don't have to use the client from a connected PS3. I appreciate the iPhone/iPad/Android remote clients which allow you to simulate a Trackpad on the phone/tablet and even get a screen capture to share on the social network of choice.  The TV supports DLNA so it can read files off a  DLNA capable NAS/router and works as a display from a phone DLNA client app - it's an interesting feature to check out although I'd rather use my MediaCenter+XBMC on a connected computer as it offers more functionality.Cons:-Flashlight effect on the screen corners-Uneven screen back lighting-Motion Trails-Remote Air Mouse (would have been better to include a standard remote)-Screen prompt always appears when display source is turned on-Processing features (TruMotion, Noise Reduction) need to be turned off to reduce display problems-Audio goes out of sync requiring TV off/on to fix (fixed a bit in the latest Software Update)Pros:-Display is pretty good (for well lit and bright scenes)-3D works well and glasses are tolerable-iPhone/Android Remote Control Client with Touch Pad style control and Screen Capture Capability-Supports USB Wireless Keyboards (some apps need update to use it)-DLNA functionality (Access data on local network and work with mobile client apps)-Low power consumptionNice but not that useful:-Set-top Box Control, can control Tivo/Cable boxes, but from the Air Remote Mouse from on-screen buttons-MyApps, how many users would actually use a limited web browser on a TV with on-screen keyboard-Voice/Speech Control, more like a novelty featureI was about to return the unit and give up on the brand and model as I did not want to play the screen quality lottery and hope to finally get a good replacement unit, but I managed to catch a price drop and I still qualified for a price match and decided to keep the unit under the new significantly lower price makes the unit flaws slightly more tolerable.The unit is definitely NOT worth its retail price with its flaws in quality control but it gets more tolerable/acceptable as the prices dropped near $2,000-$2,300 and lower price than other competitor brands especially with the ability to utilize Amazon price matching when it goes down further.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome tele", "Author": "Kat", "ReviewID": "R3E86X9O46OET3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazed at the picture and refresh rate.

The bezel surrounding the screen is extremely thin and the image appears to almost float on the wall above my fireplace.  The image is very good.  The sound is quite good with the LG sound bar I also purchased, so I cannot evaluate the native sound.Using the \"magic remote\" is a frustrating experience.  The remote operates like a cross between a traditional remote and a mouse, moving an onscreen cursor to select desired choices.  Unfortunately, the cursor often disappears or is no longer centered.  The cursor can be brought back by rapidly moving the remote horizontally.  The same motion helps only some with the centering problem.  That is, pointing the remote directly at the screen results in a cursor off to one side or the other.  Using the onscreen keyboard requires the same unreliable disappearing cursor to select keys and does not work as well as the virtual keyboard on my cellphone.The WI-FI performance is variable, with the LG pausing in the midst of streaming a movie or show, and sometimes losing the connection entirely.  To be fair, I can't determine if this is a problem with the LG or with Amazon.  I doubt it is my router because I don't recall losing the connection on my laptop.An app is available to replace the remote with one's smartphone, but I have not tried it.

I'm changing my review to 3 stars (from 5). I now get extreme light bleeding (flashlighting) from the corners. Adjusting the backlight, brightness and auto dimming helps, but in a dark room all I can notice is the bright corners. Also, on a pure black screen, I get clouding (I think that's the right term?). The screen is not uniformly black, there are lighter areas (including the corners). Everything else about this TV is great. The colors seem great. No motion artifacts. A little banding, but not that bad. And the design of the TV is beautiful - almost no bezel. I really, really wanted to like this TV, but I'm returning it because I can't live with the light leaking from the edges. It's too distracting. And this is my second unit so I won't try a third. For $2000+, I expected a much better display. I'm going to try the Sony 55HX850 or 950 and will write a review over there...Purchased this TV after reading reviews. Realized that this model was hit or miss. Most recent reviews said that this TV produced great images. Earlier reviews had issues with 24p content, but I read that recent firmware updates fixed the original problems. Anyway, Amazon had this TV on sale a couple of weeks ago at a price I couldn't refuse. The first set I received had excellent picture, but like other people had commented, had major flash lighting issues (light leakage from top and bottom). Returned set and tried again. The second unit I received didn't have any of the original issues. Absolutely stunning image quality. Deep blacks and great color. I calibrated using Disney Wow disc on Expert 1 settings. You definitely need to calibrate this set to make it great. None of the out of box setting looked good.The TV itself looks great. The bezel is so thin, the images look like they're on the wall. This TV replaced a sony 52XBR4 52\" TV and while this is 3\" larger, the foot print is actually smaller!3D looks great (because it's passive 3D, video is only half resolution but at my viewing distance, can't really notice) and because it's passive, none of the flickering you get with active glasses systems.Online content is also good. Netflix looks excellent (as good as on an Xbox/AppleTV I'd say), no issues with playing online content. Also got $50 credit at the LG 3D movie store. There's a few Disney movies, plus the Avengers in 3D. Not bad for free, but not more than a handful of content.Pros:Picture qualityBlacksColorsSmooth motionCons:Remote (You get used to it, but not my preference. I use a Harmony remote anyway).You may need to to through a couple of sets to find a good one it seems...Overall, if you buy this from Amazon, you should be good. If you get a unit that doesn't have the flash lighting or other problems, and you wait for Amazon to drop the price to ~$2000, I would highly recommend this set.
