It was a good price but I was reluctant to purchase it on line. I will say this, I received a phone call the very next day asking if I had any question about the policy, she was very nice and offered any assistance if I needed any, she emailed me the specifics of the contract and instructions on how to make a claim. Unfortunately we had to return the tv within a few days, when we called about a refund for the extended warranty they were very helpful and said no problem they are processing my refund now. Believe it or not I'm a pretty techy guy who has never ordered anything online, so far my experience with canopy and amazon has exceeded all of my expectations.Updated 9-14-2011...Received my full refund for this product, Thanks canopy for being easy to deal with and so understanding.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Jason P Mayforth", "ReviewID": "R2OEECVA8CC9MM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product, I have not had to use it, so I would have to hold off until then to review.  But they have very good customer service and within a day after purchasing I received emails from there team in reference to my purchase and all the details of program.

After comparing prices and terms among various competitors, I decided on Canopy for several reasons, as outlined below.1. Customer Service - You will receive a call from Canopy several days after purchase ensuring your satisfaction. In addition, they will answer any question you have regarding the terms and conditions of the purchased plan.2. Applicability to Refurbished Items - After speaking with an Amazon Rep, Square Trade and Canopy seem to be the only competitors available. Unfortunately, Square Trade is currently unable to provide a protection plan more than 2 years for refurbished items. Canopy provides up to 4 years with the sole condition that the refurbished television include a manufacturers warranty (most manufacturers will still provide warranty to refurbished items, albeit at a shorter term).3. Terms - The terms are significantly more practical and useful than other protection plans. Canopy will attempt to fix your television, and if unable to do so within a particular price range, will provide a check in the amount of the protection plan range.Overall, Canopy seems to have professional customer service. I will update and/or change this review if/when I begin a claim.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Have not", "Author": "Ronald Dillard", "ReviewID": "R3G6Q94FZN3VZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have not had to use it yet Hope we never have to use it That would mean we have had troublr with the TV", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's good!", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R31TK3VJUF4YBN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it , I have it .

They were very responsive in sending me the initial contact and agreement information right after my purchase.  I called them after 2 weeks because the TV went out.  They were very nice on the phone and easy to contact but their coverage only begins after the manufacturer's warranty.  They transferred me to Amazon returns and I was able to resolve my issue that way.  As far as a review of the actual Canopy Protection it's difficult for me to determine how they will do if the same type of thing occurs after the first year.  I will keep my fingers crossed.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not porvided what advertised", "Author": "Bill Bruder", "ReviewID": "RUGQYEIPISKJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The ad stated I would recieve a paper (hard) copy as well as be able to view on line.  After order was complete it stated only an online version was forthcoming.  I attempted to download the the online version but each time I only got blank pages.
