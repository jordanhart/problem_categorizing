There are not many (if any) small sets with 120Hz refresh rate like this one.  I give it 4 stars because of those features.  This is not an internet TV and the user interface is basic.  For example, after running the channel scan (I connected this to cable provider without their box...), I would have liked to re-label the channels, but that is not supported.  You can add/remove channels and lock them out using a PIN.  As a 2nd or 3rd set in your house, this should do the trick.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "It certainly gets the job done.", "Author": "J.

I'm rating the Toshiba product, not the seller I bought it from, or the carrier(fedex) they chose to get it to me with. Otherwise it'd be getting a rating of about 2 stars if that. Product got to my front door 2 weeks later than the last expected date of delivery window. Also, when I say got to my front door, that's where it was left out in open when I got home to it..So, with that being said it is a good tv. It was a little bit under my budget actually and I'm happy with my purchase so far.Bought this 32 inch for my bedroom. The main thing I was torn with while shopping around was do I get a 720p or 1080p resolution. More importantly while staying in my budget range, if I go 1080p like I want too, it's most likely going to be a generic brand or something I know little about. The main use I needed it for was to compliment my purchase of a ps4 so I needed a product that would be visually pleasing. So I did some research here and choose this because of the 120z refresh rate. Toshiba makes great tv's, period. I've known vizios to look and work beautifully right out the box and then to start having mechanical problems a couple years down the road. I put this tv up against a similar Philips 32 that's sold on here for a 50-70 bucks more.They look the same on paper, except this 120 refresh rate.Picture quality: 10Audio: 10 - no sound bar required for medium sized room, unless u need deep base and surround sound. (Which I'd then say why are you buying a 32inch lcd?)Easy to install. I started with the stand and then recently decided to wall mount it, looks great both ways! I love the way it looks mounted because the border around the actual screen is so thin. So it takes the bulky heavy look away from it unlike the Philip's I was comparing it to.Also love my tv to have a \"sleep\" function on the remote! Only con is that it's lacking ports. Only 2 hdmi and no computer monitor port.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Anthony Bryant", "ReviewID": "R32OST4QNY9FCT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro: Low weight, thin profile, great picture, decent audio, good priceCon: Lacks audio out options#butts #employeediscount #silasbear #mossybank", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good equipment but no manual", "Author": "ET on the Gulf", "ReviewID": "R2ISPZO22A2KSG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Toshiba has good equipment.

I was wrong. First of all, there are not enough HDMI outlets and there are no s video hookups so I had to buy an external cable adaptor with the video cable hook ups so I could watch Netflix from my Wii. This is not a tv for someone with 'out dated' or older technology I guess, if you consider the Wii outdated. Also, I wanted a better quality television so I could watch dark movies and still see what was going on. This one didnt cut it. I tried to watch Thor but couldnt tell what was going on half the time :( Even after multiple picture settings and adjusting the brightness, I could not get a bright enough picture. I am not satisfied and will be returning it to Walmart and getting my $244 back and upgrading it to a television with 1080p and 120hz. It makes a huge difference to have the 1080 and this television just wasnt worth saving the money to settle on avergae quality viewing. I have a 46\" samsung in the living room and the images jump out at you like you are in the darn movie. This television doesnt come close. Positives are that its farily cheap, a good brand, and its very light and easy to mount. Cons are no video hook ups for wii or older game systems, not enough color contrast in viewing, and there is also a delay when it turns on so you have to be patient.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not equiped!!", "Author": "Betty Flath", "ReviewID": "R1DKXCX1J0ZAY2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This tv has a nice picture but the sound is horrible.
