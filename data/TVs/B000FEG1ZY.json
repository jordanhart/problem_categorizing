It sits on the dresser and blends into the rest of the room well. The Instruction Manual for the remote control was well written & easy to understand. The picture and sound quality is just fine for our needs.  We dont have the HD set up yet, so I can speak to that, but this is a very nice TV for the money.", "Date": "October 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "good Toshiba", "Author": "Fun Traveler", "ReviewID": "R1KGIIAZXW2ERI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have larger Toshiba LCD TV's that I use HD on and love.  THis is a smaller version that fits nicely on a kitchen countertop under the overhanging upper cabinets.  The picture is quite good without the HD converter and the sound is very good.  I spent $15 on a better cable (at Radio Shack) than the one provided and that helped a lot with picture quality.  One negative: it does not have a digital tuner built in.  No ad will tell you this, although Toshiba has a sticker on the front of the TV to inform the consumer.  This is true of any brand.", "Date": "February 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "It is not as advertised and hard to hear", "Author": "Marcia Kramer", "ReviewID": "R2SGBOEQ2I6M1V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the sound is muffled and there is a \"block\" that came with the TV.
