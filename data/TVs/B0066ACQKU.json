Big attraction was 12V power and DVD to use on boat without running generator.  Picture quality not on par with other LED's (low contrast ratio?)  Sound (speakers) is the poorest I've heard.

Napper Sr.", "ReviewID": "R2WFREFO5ITFRS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The tv never performed from the time I took it out of the packaging container. Since I had more to do than work with a non working tv set it exceeded the 90 day warranty period. After several very heated conversations with the manufacturer (Super Sonic)that the tv was flawed they asked that I return it to their warehouse at my expense and they would repair my set an return it to me. The turn around time was quick. the only problem is they returned the same tv with out repairing it. I again contacted the dealer and stated that i would only accept a new tv since I had so much problem with them. They agreed and sent to me a new tv which was not the same model.The original model was a combination DVD player and tv. I received back a tv only. After more than 6 months trying to get some attention and satisfaction I decided to just keep the tv as received rather than going through more agony and expense.This is my story and I'm sticking to it. The bottom line is I will not purchase another Super Sonic product.Phillip J.

I was seriously dissapointed when we received the product and found out that it did not have a DVD player as advertised.  I'm sure they just sent us the wrong product but is it a huge inconvenience.

It works fine on 12v for TV reception:  picture quality good and sound okay; but when playing DVDs, with it cranked all the way up to 100 for sound, it was still hard to hear.  This happened whether we used the built-in DVD player, or a separate DVD player.  The funny thing was, if we switched the language to something other than English, the sound quality was better/louder.  It's not terrible, but it could be better.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "ehhh", "Author": "Liz", "ReviewID": "R2HQMMQSJ3RBBZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "it did not work when we received it. the company tried blaming ups saying it was damaged during delivery. the product was not physically damaged. it just did not work, the picture was blurry and it wouldn't play a dvd", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible", "Author": "R.
