{"Reviews": [{"Title": "How I Found my HDTV", "Author": "Richard Krzemien", "ReviewID": "R6FWB0T6QX736", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started searching for an HDTV about seven-years ago while doing some work at CES in Las Vegas.  I still remember the moment I spotted my first HD set there.  It was a 60\" Zenith showing a Dallas Cowboys football game.  I stared at the box for about an hour with a small drop of drool hanging from my chin-despite really disliking the Cowboys.  After talking with the sales rep., I was sure I'd have a set within a year.  Then the HD standards wars began, things got ugly and everything was put on hold.Years passed.  My son, who was 9-years old at the time of the CES show, got older and I got grumpier.With each passing season I would check out every new HDTV set.  I looked at successive generations of plasmas, front projectors, DLPS, LCDs,  rear-projection RGB sets and D-ILAs.  Each time I thought, this year, this technology will be the one where cost, styling and picture quality converge to produce the winner.  But plasma was way too expensive, and every other technology had artifacts that left me wanting.  And that Zenith I saw at CES? That was a one-of-a-kind TV that cost about 100K.  So each year my son and I returned home empty handed.Then last year I walked into a showroom and my heart fluttered for the first time since that day in Vegas.  Sitting on a high-tech stand was a stunning Sony 60\" Grand Vega XBR.  It was a gorgeous package with an amazingly sharp picture.  But after looking closer, I started seeing artifacts that made me reconsider:  Fast motion sequences would pixelate.  The \"screen door effect\" started bothering me, and the shiny glass font reflected everything that wasn't black.  What I thought was going to be a long-term relationship-and an important bonding experience with my son-became a 1-hour fling.  My son didn't talk to me for a week.Then this past October (2004), Sony released its KDF-60XS955.  I read every review.  I scanned all the specs.  I waited for it to arrive somewhere, anywhere.  Then one day as I was walking through Frys, I spotted one on the showroom floor and immediately fell in love.  In fact, I was stunned at how attractive the entire package was: great looks, great price, and a great picture.  Something had to be wrong.I didn't tip my hand immediately.  I went home and came back a few days later to see if my memory of the set was as good as the actual thing.  Amazingly, it was.  That had never happened before.  When viewing other sets for a second time, I found that my memory of them was always better than the real thing.So I came back to view the 60XS955 five more times, and each time the picture thrilled me. I was even more amazed when I learned that the 60XS955 I had been looking at was connected to a set of rabbit ears-not cable or satellite like all the other sets-just a $12 piece of metal sitting on top of the Sony. I went to other stores to see what the picture looked like connected to satellite and I was even more impressed.Needless to say, I finally bought one.  When it arrived and I turned it on, it looked even better than in the showroom.  It took a few days to figure out that, since I don't have 90 fluorescent tube lights installed in the ceiling of my living room, I don't have all that ambient light reflecting off the front of the screen.  When my now 16-year-old son first saw the picture (during a Lakers/Rockets game that was being broadcast in HD) he hugged me and said those three words every father longs to hear, \"So how much?\"  I told him it was about $700 below retail (Pacific Sales in L.A.)  He then mumbled that he loved me and we all watched the game together.If you're interested in all the specs, you can easily get them from Sony.  But here are a few that were important to me.  This set finally incorporates and standardizes a number of different technologies.  For example, it has a CableCard input.  I have cable, so by renting the CableCard and avoiding the charge for a second cable box from Time Warner, I save $5.50/mo.  I believe the CableCard also produces a cleaner signal, but I've not done a side-by-side comparison yet.The set has a built-in HD turner if you want to pick up off-the-air broadcasts with your own set of $12 rabbit ears.  The front screen has a matt finish so you won't see those nasty glass reflections that the XBR series produces.  Possibly because of the matt finish and a smaller chipset most, if not all, of the \"screen door effect\" has been eliminated.  The processors are now faster so there's little to no pixelation in the background of fast-moving sequences, unlike the current crop of DLP sets that produce a tiling effect with fast moving images. The NTSC tuner has been greatly improved so normal, non-digital or non-HD broadcasts are watchable.  (You immediately get spoiled with HD, so anything less is a letdown, but they're watchable.)  All of these advances have converged to produce images that almost look 3-D when viewing HD broadcasts.This 60\" Sony also sports the new HDMI connection standard that allows for uncompressed HD and non-HD DVD viewing with DVD players that have an HDMI output.  The remote is adequate, but somewhat of a letdown.  The accompanying Sony stand is a bit expensive but gorgeous, and a perfect match for this set.  This year's stand also has 2 shelves; unlike the one shelve on last year's XBR model.  The sound is rich and full with a respectable sub-woofer.  All of that and the TV weighs only about 113 lbs.A side note:  I've read that some people have complained about visual noise or distortion.  I believe much of it comes from cheap cables and connectors.  This set is very sensitive and very big.  Small amounts of snow on a 27\" set can look like a snowstorm on a 60\" set.  But with the right cables the picture is crystal clear.  So don't cheep out.  Get the more expensive shielded, gold-plated cables, like those from Monster, for example.  Also, get an AC line filter and surge protector (About $79.  Mine is also a Monster.  It will clean up the picture, protect the sensitive electronics and extend the life of the bulb).  With those added items, this TV should look like you're viewing reality.So after a seven-year wait, I've finally found my HD set.  My son has a new-found respect for my nerdy side, my wife now knows that there really wasn't \"another woman\" working at Frys I'd been seeing, and the space I had reserved seven-years ago along the wall in my living room has finally been filled with a truly beautiful piece of technology.Richard Krzemien[...]", "Date": "December 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "First Impression: A great new model Sony HDTV", "Author": "G. Davis", "ReviewID": "R35ZSHGLV2X8EI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First impresssion:  I love it.  The HD picture is absolutely gorgeous and, happily, the SD picture seems to be very much improved over what the Sony HDTV's produced with their 2003 models. The TV has two tuners, including a built-in digital HDTV tuner, and it will accept a \"cable card\" so you don't need a box.The manual leaves something to be desired.  Many subjects that should be discussed in detail are barely mentioned.  I wonder if the manual-writers actually watched or adjusted this TV before writing about it.Example: The \"Live Color\" setting merits only a sentence or two in the manual but, as the default setting from the factory, it made all the white areas of the picture swim crazily, like a 1960's \"psychedelic\" poster until, through trial and error, I found it buried in \"Advanced\" video settings and turned it off.There are two coax cable inputs, \"VHF/UHF\" and \"Cable\".  I think the former is mostly for attaching an external antenna and your cable from the wall really has to go into the other one but this is not made clear.  In any case, cable attached to \"VHF/UHF\" will not tune to very many channels and there is no setting in the menus to alter this.  The manual is not helpful on this subject.\"Twin View\" is great -- very useful, very intuitive.The TV's styling, with speaker \"wings\" out on either side of the screen, is very beautiful.Sony had a lot of trouble with lamp and lamp-starter problems in the 2003 models, which they believe they fixed in mid-2004.  We can be hopeful that, in the new models, they have fixed it for good.All I have right now are my first impressions and they are very, very good.  I love this TV!", "Date": "October 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "Criminal design from a shameful company.", "Author": "OleMissFan", "ReviewID": "R3GC0P4P8WCM4Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had my set for 5 years. I had to replace the original bulb after the first year and am still using the replacement.Before I get into the review let it be known Sony is being sued for knowingly selling us a defective set. As good as this set looks on the outside, they all have a design flaw: The optical block or light engine assembly.This is a very expensive ($1400) piece to replace that was not designed correctly. It warps because of heat and results in splotches and screen image issues. On my TV, ghosting occurs. Sony extended the warranty of these TV's to 2008 but the issue did not occur on my TV till 3 months ago.Sony never did redesign the replacement part, so on the TV's that sony did repair in warranty, those parts are only going to last another 2-3 years.The only equitable recourse purchasers of these models have is to either sell them for scrap and purchase a newer model LCD or take their light engine out and send it in for repair. There is a company or two out there that will rebuild them for around $300 with a 6 month warranty but expect the issue to come back again in another 3-4 years.So, for as good as the picture looks on these televisions, which is great, the above issue ruins the entire model. You are gambling with your money and time purchasing one of these sets.If it did not have this issue, and if the part was redesigned to correct the flaw, it would have received all 5 stars but as it is, this is a rip off and a knife in my side from a company such as sony.Everything in my house is sony, from my alarm clock to the receiver in my car, but no more. A company that would sell a life time customer such as myself a TV for $3500 knowing it was defective and not even have the decency to correct the flaw does not deserve my nor your business.Shame and you Sony.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "THE most awesome TV around", "Author": "Mike Soursby \"mrsour\"", "ReviewID": "R2P0SQIHTFW8RX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a year, with a friend, looking for a large-screen TV.I've been waiting, and waiting, and waiting.  Technology seems to always get better, faster.  But, I finally wanted something.I have a 36\" Mitsuibishi tube TV, that I bought when they first came out, and LOVE it.  Well, it's NOTHING compared to this awesome TV.I ALMOST bought the Samsung 56\" DLP P5685W...Boy, am I glad I finally saw this Sony next to it in Circuit City.  I thought the Samsung was good..The Sony is even better.The Samsung (and I hear may DLP's) has an issue with regular TV broadcasts, where it \"flickers\", especially on writing that's on the screen.The Sony has none of that, and it's the most CRISP, clear picture I've seen.  Just remember, this thing is going to look about 50% bigger in your home, than it does in the store.  I wanted a BIG tv, but I was amazed at just how BIG it really is, once it's in your house :-)What I like:Crispness.Easy to use menu systemsHDMI inputs (I bought the Sony DVP-NS975V DVD player)...I suggest if you watch a lot of DVD's, definitely get a new DVD player with HDMI input.  VERY awesome.Viewing angle is supurb.  You can almost go completely \"sideways\" and still have a nice pic.What I DON'T LIKE:The \"headphone\" thing - speakers must be turned off b4 they work.I bought mine for $3399 from a local retailer, and am very glad I made the jump.", "Date": "February 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Really nice set with some issues", "Author": "J. SPIEGEL \"Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R34XRKQP1BVTRF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this set (60XS955) in Nov. of 2004. What impressed me was the standard def picture. Most HD sets look really really good in HD but fall flat on their face in std. def. This set looked reasonably good in SD in the store so I hoped it would at home. It did. Not as good as my old RPTV but good enough. The HD images (especially on Discovery HDT) are unreal and very 3D. It shows up some HD channels that compress to much in their broadcast.There are always anomolies with high tech items and this set is no exception, hence 4 stars not 5 for what is a very good set.1) Audio out doesn't work like expected. If you have a set of wireless headphones, say one from Sony?, you can't use them. You see, you have to TURN OFF the attached speakers to use the audio out jacks. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!?! ADA FAILURE.2) Say you take the time to label all your channels so they read CNN NBC ABC etc as you surf. Then let's say down the road you scan the channels to see if your CATV provider added any new ones. Well all that work went down the drain because it erases all the labels. OOPS!3)Let's say you have a TiVo or ReplayTV and hook it to input 3 using S-Video. What about none of the label choices say DVR until input 5/Component.Am I picky? Sure, it's $4K! There shouldn't be any issues, they should use the set they make and figure it out before selling it.One more thing, I'm using a Harmony 676 and it has discreet input codes all the way to input 7, then 8 is 7 + up one. Maybe that's a Harmony issue, but I don't think Sony has a discreet code for input 8. Oh Well.It's still a good set and has very nice imaging!", "Date": "January 31, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great picture -- big problems", "Author": "Roland", "ReviewID": "RDDPHAL18944Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We bought our Sony KDF-60 two months ago, and the picture was great.  Unfortunately today, after watching some football, turning the set off, and then turning it on again, the picture will not turn on.  This is true even after waiting for over 30 minutes.  The lamp fan whirs continuously and the screen does not darken completely.  Having had the set for only two months, and having not used it extensively, we are disappointed to have such a serious problem so soon.  From reading other posts on the web, it appears as though Sony has had persistent lamp problems, so maybe this is more evidence of that.", "Date": "January 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the short term", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R2XQK4IMBTD0QM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in 2005 and would have given it 5 stars at the time.  The lamp needed to be replaced about a year ago and since the TV is on for hours at a time it was no great expense to buy a new one.  Now I have found out that the blue that has been creeping along the bottom of the screen is due to an optical block issue that Sony has been aware of for quite some time.  I have read that it may be cheaper to just trash the TV and buy a new one instead of trying to get this optical block issue repaired.

In 2005 while buying DVD's I wanted to stroll thru the TV's and see the new technology. That's when I came across Sony's art work. Stylish frame with the side speakers was impressive. A matte front panel to protect the screen and reduce glare (not many with this feature), good for little kids that have to touch everything! It's more affordable with the combination of projection with the sharp picture of an HD LCD. If your kids play a lot of video games (me sometimes) you don't have to worry about screen burn. HDMI connections with more than enough video ports to hook up everything - HD satellite box, receiver/amplifier, DVD, VCR, Xbox, Wii, Play Station 3. Plus Memory stick compatible to really show off the family pictures (so your old parents can see them)! ;^) As far as HD action goes - I watch Discovery HD, HD sports, HD movies action and Sci Fi with no problems. Once you go HD it's difficult to watch standard definition. Put it this way, after looking at it on the sales room floor and finding out about it's features I looked at my wife to discuss finances when she said \"Go ahead and get it, I love it.\". Sold!  Writing this in June 2008 with over 8300+ hrs on the lamp timer and just replaced the lamp. I found one online for $130 and how to reset the timer myself. It's an easy change out.
