My main TV is a nice 42\" LG and this one is not quite on par with the LG, but still a darn good TV.Pros:  Price, picture, sound.Cons:  Cheap remote, slow channel change.Note: Like other reviews here you'll find that out of the box this TV is dark. If you try to increase the Backlight you'll find that nothing happens. That's because the Backlight settings are turned off by Energy Saver.Go into Setup and turn Energy Saver OFF and now you can adjust your Backlight and get a nice looking picture.Replace the cheap remote with a better one and you're all set.

The stand is sturdy and even though the flatpanel is rather light it feels very solid.Sadly I had to deduct two stars for four reasons.1. It's VGA PC input is incapable of 1920x1080 at 60Hz. If an $87.oo 21\" LCD Acer screen can take full HD through VGA then so should a $400.oo LCD screen.>>>>>>Turns out that TOSHIBA has intentionally crippled Full-HD through the PC/VGA input.The RGB Component input can take Full HD though.Crazy huh? Why would TOSHIBA do this? It's quite annoying to lose an essential input. The VGA input can only properly display 4:3 resoltions.2. The only analog (RCA) sound output option is a bit noisy, (lots of hiss). Hooking up to non-optical equipped receivers is a waste of time.3. Remote control has poor responsiveness, often needing repeated button pushing and hard mashing to work.4. PC hook up though HDMI was more succesful, but took a lot of patience and repeated efforts for only marginal success. (read instructions closely)>>>Update July 18th 2012.Screen began taking longer and longer to reach full brightness. Something appears to be wrong with the CFL backlighting system. This recent problem coupled with the lack of a usable VGA PC input has led with me no recourse other than to send it back.This model is one the best selling on the web, and for most people it's a good product.

This TV is not 1.8\" but actually 3.9\" without the stand. That is what you would expect for a TV this size anyways. This TV, unlike most TV does have a auto dimmer to help save energy and the life of the screen. I find it to operate a little cheaply, and enjoy the picture much more with the auto-dimming off. As a reference, I own a high-end HDTV as well and that one I left the auto-dimming on as it performs wonderfully. The picture on this TV meets my expectations for a cheap TV, the blacks and whites are decent and the 60Hz performs nicely. I do like that they actually put some effort into this unit with the ability to produce clear sound with what they call Audyssey Premium Television. I haven't noticed that the sound is better than average, but more importantly I haven't noticed the sound is bad.

I have it sitting on a desk which is perfect height wise for the bed. The sound is not great but I hooked it up to a VIZIO VSB200 Universal HD Sound Bar when I watch TV. It sounds wonderful! I managed to put the sound bar behind the TV stand since it sits out a little far. I also am using it as a monitor to a PC I have in the bedroom that I rarely use. However, having the VGA input is perfect; the picture is nice even though it is only 4:3 aspect ratio for the PC. I also have a Roku hooked up to it via a HDMI cable and it looks and sounds great!When I crawl into bed tired, I love watching TV on my Toshiba. With tax I spent more than what it is listed here but am very happy with it.

I called customer service because my tv would not turn on, the power indicator would come on then go off within 30 sec but there was no picture or sound. Customer service told me that they would create a work order and I would get an email from Nexicore. They automatically ordered a motherboard without even seeing my tv. Once my part was in the service provider would contact me within 24hrs to sch and it took 3 days to sch an appt w/ (Nick) he then told me he had to come to my house before 4pm because he lived on the other side of town and wanted to miss traffic. He replaced the motherboard and 2hrs later the tv is not working. I was then told they had to order the part again another 3-5 days and then resch a service visit. I told them at this time I did not want the same employee to come to my house and this was ignored. I was told that there are 3 parts to a flat screen tv the motherboard, power panel and the screen. So this time they order both the motherboard and the power panel to guess which part is bad. The same service employee came back out (nick) replaced the parts and the tv worked for 2 weeks. Then the tv not only wouldn't power on correctly but would emit a screeching sound. I then called Toshiba and told them that I do not want to deal with Nexicore any longer and they gave me a list of 3 authorized service providers. I brought my t.v. to HI Definition Electronics and they had no cooperation from Toshiba w/ ordering parts and were told that they were not an authorized service provider after Toshiba was the one to give me their contact. I had to call the customer relations manager myself and be placed on hold while he was on the phone w/ HI definition. Finally both companies decided to order the motherboard for a 3x and Hi definition replaced the part and informed me that the same malfunction is occurring. Finally my complaint was escalated to Mikalla but all Toshiba states that they can do is order another part and keep trying to fix the tv. I have been told by a customer relations manager that this is how electronics work and they will just keep replacing parts until they get it. Then Mikkalla told me I have not been through enough to get a replacement and that all they can do is order another part. I asked what else and how much longer until they actually will make this right and she stated that is not something that they inform the consumer of. Also I was informed that I did not read my warranty information and have not went through the proper steps to get the tv repaired which, I would think that they would of notified me of this the first time I called 3 months ago. It clearly states on my Toshiba warranty \"if your are experiencing a technical problem or have questions regarding operation, Authorized service providers, warranty or parts, please contact customer service department at: 1800-631-3811\"  Mikkalla also stated that I own this tv and it is my responsibility to get it fixed not Toshiba's.

After hooking this baby up and adjusting the power feature to the off position(the picture sucks with it on)I used the composite jack on it to run my DVD and satellite till Directv upgraded my box (about a week later) and I have to say I was pretty impressed with the picture. It's wasn't as clear as my CRT TV, but it was better than I expected. After the upgrade to the HD box with the HDMI cable I was just blown away! This TV makes watching shows like True Blood so much better. I had no idea what I was missing in the picture! My only complaint seems to be with the sound. Now I have my TV hooked up to a sound system so this is kind of a non-issue for me, but for those without it could be a problem. The sound coming from the TV is incredibly low, even turned up to 50. I have yet to figure out a way to make that better, but I will keep trying. It's only bad enough for me to knock off one star. People complain about the remote a lot on these reviews, but tell you the truth I don't use mine much. I use maybe 3 or 4 buttons on it and the rest I use Directv remote.

I'm loving the TV, and if only it had not failed the first time round, I'd recommend it handily.Edit: I have had a negative/bad experience with this Toshiba television. Barely a month after buying it, it stopped displaying an image. The tech came out, replaced the board, but this still did not fix the issue. He gauged this to be a manufacturing defect with some wire within the frame. I'm still doing the run-around for a replacement on my now dead TV.Original review:We needed a second television for the bedroom and after much research, opted for the Toshiba 40E220U 40-Inch 1080p 60Hz LCD HDTV. The motivating factors behind our choice were* Great price - the closest comparable name-brand 40\" television was at least $40 higher* Good references* Visual verification of picture quality at SearsThe television arrived and has been wall-mounted. The picture quality is superb. It is very responsive. Darks are crisp and fast motion is captured with very little lag. We've opted to plug in a Roku 2 XS box instead of a full-fledged DVR and there's more than enough content to make it a good choice. The only other one we might have gone for would have been the Panasonic Viera IPS.A brief note on the higher end options like LED backlights and 120HZ displays - While both afford steps up in picture quality, remember that LED backlit televisions are still LCD television. Secondly, movies and broadcast television looks really bad with high background noise and plasticky in 120HZ/240HZ displays so don't expect a 'richer HD' experience.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Screen was defective need to return after only 2 hours post delivery", "Author": "kmason", "ReviewID": "R113JOUG55JFAD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought TV and was excited initially based on the deal I got.

So make sure you mess around with the options before deciding you're not happy with the picture. No complaints about the sound either, works great out of the box. We had planned on hooking up a sound bar, but it's really not necessary.Only con is that like another reviewer stated, the remote is simply horrible. It's cheap and feels like it's going to fall apart. You also have to be at just the perfect angle from the TV to get it to work, I find myself having to stand up and walk over to the other side of the room to do anything remote-related.We're mainly using it to watch movies(and I watch Netflix during the day while I work on our Xbox 360).

I'll try to update this review later when I've had a chance to upgrade to high-def satellite programming. Meanwhile, here are some tips to try and save extra hassle for other new owners. Initial problems were made a lot worse by Toshiba's failure to include a decent set of instructions in the box. If I'd bought this at a local store instead of online, there's a good chance I would have given up and taken it back. If you don't already have a blu-ray DVD player with upsampling or high-def TV programming, you may want to consider making those upgrades first before you buy this TV so you'll know how good it really is while you still have time to return it. The best thing about this TV so far is I was able to get it for the same price online as discount brands at my local Wal-Mart and Best Buy. The first thing any new owner should do is download a copy of the full owner's manual from Toshiba's web site and keep it open on a laptop in the same room if possible. Don't turn the TV on until after you have plugged in all your input devices (cable/satellite box, DVR, DVD player, etc.) and have them all turned on so the TV set can detect all of the input signals you will be using; this is most important if you use a standard def coax Ant/Cable, or a standard def cable/satellite box. After the initial setup, the first thing you'll want to look for is the \"Energy Saver Setting\" for automatic brightness control to see if it makes your picture too dark and if turning this off helps make it bright enough for you. You can turn this back on later if you like to keep news or other programming on in the background all day and want to save some electricity. For any inputs with standard def devices, you'll want to look for Noise Reduction settings and the CableClear option. Turning the noise reduction settings up to high is what made my standard def satellite box (Dish Network DVR 625)go from unwatchable to pretty good, but I had to spend some time browsing and searching through the full owner's manual I downloaded to find out about this. I also wound up having to reset the TV a couple times because nothing was connected the first time I hit the power button and the CableClear option wasn't available on picture settings menu.

I was shocked at the poor overall quality of the picture, the most important aspect for me.So that LG 3D model (47LM6700) didn't even make it out of the trials stage.Amazon's exceptional return policy allowed me to return the LG model at no cost to me and I was refunded the full amount back within 5 days of UPS taking it away. Bravo Amazon.So I found this $400 Toshiba 40-inch 1080p 60Hz model and wow, I'm so very happy with it! The picture quality is simply superb. When viewing 1080P footage via ROKU from either Netflix or Amazon Prime I'm amazed by the high quality that's being streamed, not exactly Blu-Ray quality but excellent nevertheless. That said, when viewing Blu-Ray, DVDs, even 1080i, the colors are deep, there's no botchiness (another artifact of that LG model when viewing a dark screen) and the whole picture has an exceptionally high level of clarity.This Toshiba doesn't have 3D but I'm not sure 3D models are quite up to par yet. They may do 3D well enough but if non-3D viewing is effected due to the technology necessary to do both, well that's no good. In any regard the few films and few times I found myself utilizing 3D with that LG model just didn't warrant a $600 increase. Don't know for sure why the LG had such poor picture quality while viewing regular programming, but I do know a bad image when I see it.This is a no-frills TV -- except for the picture quality -- and at $400 or less it's golden.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 40\"", "Author": "yodan2", "ReviewID": "R1RZI9NUOT6SXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The stand was easy to attach, setting up was a piece of cake, and the picture quality is outstanding with a better then expected contrast ratio.

ORourke", "ReviewID": "RRNLVQBYAT00T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Great priceGreat pictureSound is fineCons:Volume varies widely between inputs.In a quiet room, sitting at any distance up to about 15 feet, a volume of \"1\" is generally sufficient, sometimes even too loud. In a more noisy room (fans, etc) a volume of \"3 - 5\" is usually fine. After about \"10\" it's pretty much all the same, but yet it goes all the way up to \"100\" - what's the point? I'd like to see more control of the volume. In my opinion the range should be from 1 to about 50: the first 10 stops should  basically range from \"too quiet to hear\" to \"low volume\", then you should start getting into normal listening range from about 11-30, and then it should max out at 50. For this tv, with such a huge range from 1-100, wouldn't it make sense if maybe 15-45 was a normal listening range?Another problem with the volume (or maybe it's the HDMI inputs or devices?) is that between my cable provider's DVR, AppleTV, and Roku the volume varies widely. I mentioned earlier that you can view normally at 1, well that's on the DVR and for content delivered through AppleTV's iTunes media, but when you get into AppleTV's other apps like Netflix or HBOGo you need to turn it all the way up to 10-30 sometimes. All Roku apps pretty much require a lot of volume too. And it's that weird kind of volume where you can't hear it well in the room where the tv is, but in other rooms or downstairs / upstairs it seems really loud - you can't hear exactly what's being said, but you can definitely hear a loud tv somewhere else in the house.Also, there's only two HDMI inputs.Bottom Line:The price is right. I got burned on a $1600 Samsung that was new in 2010 and the screen fizzled out about 18 months later so I went with this cheap tv and it's lasted just as long so far.

It will boot up to show input settings, then the picture goes dim, then completely goes out; like on standby mode!!!Action taken: July 26, 2012 I called Toshiba tech support, we trouble shot for almost 1 hour; and it appears either the HDMI ports on the TV, or the HD cable box may be bad.***UPDATE 8/5/2012***..The tv is working \"full speed ahead\". My HD signal from my cable supplier had dropped one night. Normally most tv's can receive the signal again once the system is up. However, I had unplugged all of my connections when I called Toshiba, during trouble shooting the issue.So on August 5, 2012 I replugged everything in it's place, and let the cable box reboot. Then I called my cable supplier. The technician told me that some HD tv's have difficulty finding the input signals after the cable goes out. In order to get the HD signal back I had to use the tv remote, to click, and enter all of the inputs, s/a antenna/cable, HDMI 1 & 2, and so on down the line, one at a time. After approx 4 rotations the tv retrieved the signals. YEH!!An easier way to get the signal back is to press the ON button on the HD cable box once, to refresh, and if the tv screen doesn't come on, Press it again it will come up in about 4 seconds..this is guaranteed to work.Toshiba tech taught me how to varify if the problem is the tv, or the cable; press the menue button. If the information comes onto the screen, the tv is functioning; as it was in my case It has just lost the HD signal.***UPDATE 8/27/2012*** TV is still working great. It appears that this incident with the other TV's within this line, may be partially the fault of the cable supplier; and not soley the TV itself. However in my case I tried other issues that could be affecting the workings of the TV. So glad I did, because the price was a contributing factor of why I bought this one in particular. Also my husband, and I have two Toshiba 30 inch big square tv's, and both are still working after 15 years. No kidding. They are just to bulky now; so we opted to go flat.UPDATE: 11/08/2013 Television is working fabulously super. Still have issues with keeping strong HD signals; just refresh on the cable box, or the remote, and were up to vewing on average 6 seconds. This may occur 3 times a month only.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INITIAL PURCHASE REVIEW:The TV is exceptional for the price of 399.00.

This is a good looking TV, great picture, great price, lightweight and perfect size for a large bedroom or a smaller living-room. The remote control looks and feels cheap but don't care, I am using the cable remote. The sound is fine, plenty of volume. A couple of minor things I have noticed: if you are watching TV from an angle the picture became a little fuzzy, but this is not a bid deal for me. Also, to power-up the TV takes long time, almost a full 10 seconds, again not a big deal but kind of strange for a LCD; remind me a little of my childhood TV with tube. Overall a great buy for some like me who is looking for a TV easy to operate and do not want to pay for stuff that many times you will never need or use.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV", "Author": "Medici", "ReviewID": "REB0UTNR6CYC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just watched North By Northwest on the Toshiba and the color was superb. And this is an older movie shown on TCM which I don't believe is broadcast in HD. I'm really tickled pink with this TV including its looks and that of the big oval stand.For what it's worth, this is a great tv for old b&w; movies, dvds and tv shows. Film noir looks great on it. I just watched San Fransisco and the earthquake scenes were well rendered. Every shade and shadow appeared in those scenes. The new technology shows the superior photography of old movies very well.There's visual static at the very top in the native view of b&w; shows but the full view is very similar and doesn't have that problem.I don' t know if a Samsung of similar quality would be better, they're supposed to be the best, but this one is very good.

This was reasonably priced but it has some drawbacks. \\ customer support. long, automated, and requiring you manually read the serial number to a machine which doesn't understand you. took three tries just to find out where the old dvd player gets attached to the new tv. Evidently the yellow lead goes into the green plug.But the biggest gripe I have is in setting the channels. I get my feed off a switched set of antennae. With my old digital box you could automatically add channels and it would find new channels without deleting the old. This is handy if you have a pair of antennae ( or an antenna with a rotor.) but with the Toshiba if you run the setup again you lose the ones you had stored before. Now if you read the online manual( another minus by the way), it says you can just manually add the channel. yeah right. I tried adding  ch 9 here in seattle) and it could find nothing.  I run the scanner with the outside antenna and it found it. but couldn't find 5. so when I tune to five it first thinks it's analog then if you punch in 5 100 1 it gets that it's 5-1. But when you go to signal strength  section under menu it still thinks its analog and shows 0 signal strength. I could pick up 5 on the digital converter with the old crt tv with the indoor antenna. and briefly had 5 on the new set but 4 9 11 and 13 were lost. so I keep running the setup till I get a representative set.  I realize that every time you switch tv's the inside antenna placement requires some tinkering but it would certainly be nice if I did not have to risk losing the stations I've found just to add one.In a word, frustrating.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "MAYBE I GOT LUCKY BUT", "Author": "K.

I also looked at a Toshiba 65\" LCD TV while shopping for the replacement and saw that it had the same pixelation and sharpness issues.  It must be a problem with the cheaper Toshiba TV's.I will say that Amazon's return process is super easy and efficient.  I paid the $6 for UPS to pick it up and they were there 1 business day after I requested the refund.  Amazon covers the return shipping...so kudos to them.  This is just a poor quality TV compared to other 40-42\" models in the sub-$500 category.  if all you care about is price, by all means, go for it.
