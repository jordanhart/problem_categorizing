{"Reviews": [{"Title": "won't work for long", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R5YYO139DFYT6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought two  of these TV's on black Friday from Walmart last year and wouldn't you know it that both tv's had the invertor power boards go out on them with in two days of each other. We are just days out of warranty and nothing we can do except pay to have another board installed at $ 190 dollars each.  Save your money and frustration and  buy a good TV. Spend the extra money and get a good TV. My kids were terribly disappointed as these were Christmas presents for thier rooms.Key points for trouble shooting the  board problems are:1 - no power when you turn on TV even after trying other outlets and doing the 30 minute unplug and reset process explained in the owner manual2- When you take the back off the unit to make sure the cord is good you will find a blown fuse in the lower right hand corner of the main power board. ( 4 amp 125 v fuse )3- replace the fuse, if it works again congrats you got off cheap !, most likely it will blow again because the transformers on the board are faulty. ( which caused the fuse to blow the first time)4- Now you have to order a new board at the cost of 60 dollars (cheapest i found on ebay) and replace yourself. Or take it to a shop who will do the same repair for about $190.5- its about a two hour job to do the repair yourself. Changing the board is very easy. Only 6 sconnections to make and they all are unique so you can't plug them in wrong. The only problem is there has not been an upgrade that i know of on the boards and you are uncertain as to how long the new board will last.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV - Great Price - Buy the Warranty", "Author": "K.P.", "ReviewID": "RTTB23UGWIA4B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just bought some of these from Walmart on Black Friday.  The model number is slightly different, but it has the same specs. This is a good to very good TV overall, but an excellent TV for the $148 price and remains a bargain even after paying $10-$15 for an extended warranty.1.) Based on the other reviews I read I bought the extended 2 year replacement warranty from Walmart for $15. You can buy this warranty for up to 30 days AFTER buying the TV, so it is still not too late if you bought the TV on Black Friday.  If you do not want the Walmart warranty then the manufacturer also has an optional warranty for $9.99 that extends the labor warranty from 90 days to a year. With this the labor will match the parts standard one year warranty. Consumer reports said most problems occur within the 1st year so either extended warranty would cover this period.2.) Like most HDTV's make sure to adjust the settings on the cable/satellite provider's box then adjust the TV settings.  I had a friend that bought the same models and complained about the picture not being as clear as standard definition and returned the tv instantly.  After questioning him in more detail it was his 1st HDTV and he did not adjust the settings.3.) I have Time Warner and adjusted the cable box box resolution to auto select.  Then I adjusted the picture to Personal and used the following customized settings:Backlight 20, Contrast 38, Brightness 40, Color 54, Tint G2, Sharpness 16.  For Advanced Settings I set the Color Alignment to Normal, left the Noise Reduction, Black Stretch, and Dynamic Contrast On, and the Gamma at Gamma 1With these settings the picture quality is Very Good.I am sure some other TV's on the market have better video quality and / or more features (Samsung Model UN32EH4050 Costco $239 today), but they cost at least 40% more than the Walmart $148 Black Friday price.  However if you bought one of the Emersons on Black Friday and you take the time to buy the extended warranty and properly adjust the settings, then I believe you'll find out this was one of the BEST DEALS out there!", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "died 14 months later", "Author": "tmack", "ReviewID": "R2P0UOJMQ255U6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The tv worked great for a year good color and picture.

The picture is quite decent for the amount of money paid. The sound is great. It's actually better than the defective Vizio I returned to the store (see my other review for Vizio). Set up was easy. I didn't even need to refer to the instruction manual. The remote is perfect. Everything is displayed where I thought it should be. There is no bright neon logo light on the front of the screen,like Vizio has. The entire frame is black and non-intrusive.The picture quality isn't as crisp I would like it, but it's certainly doable for people on a tight budget. If you sit directly in line with the screen, the blacks will be jet black, but if you sit slightly off to either side, the blacks become dark grey. It ruins the contrast. If you're single and you can hog the TV for yourself, it'll be great for you.I don't like the flat-screen touch controls (on/off, volume, channel selector, etc) built into the TV frame. They are impossible to see without bending down and getting within inches of the panel.****UPDATE**** April 2013. The touch screen controls on the TV frame stopped working. None of them respond to touch. The TV won't even turn on and off unless I use the remote.

I called customer service up and explained to them what happened, the agents f****ng insinuated and assumed I was lying to get a new tv, this including the SUPERVISOR whom was courteous enough to argue the whole time i was stating my situation. I told them I will send that P.O.S. back to them and they can look at it them selves, when they see the interior crack that their insipid company is supporting. I had a 3 hour conversation  with the customer service just to be told I am lying and to send them $70 to fix the P.O.S. for labor.

I read more than 200 bad reviews on this product and the Maker \"Emerson\" itself, this is the first ever junk I bought from emerson and it will be the last one! the maxmum age of this TV is 3-8 months, emerson gives only 90 days waranty so every seller is....after 90 days they will tell you to drive to their repare shop which could be from 2 hours to 4 hours driving away, average labor cost $120.00-$380.00 sounds funny? the TV itself costs under $250.00, what about your gas and mileage? be smart with your money, when these stupids move their production plants to china, provide us with 3rd world standard product, and still want to charge us 300% more than what it actually costs to make, you need to stick with local and more expensive products for so many reasons!
