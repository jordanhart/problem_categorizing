I'm a retired electrical engineer and do not believe on going overboard, spending more than adequate to get a good result on  audio and video component.  There are cables in the market that are priced too high to get the money out of those people who are willing to pay the price.  Those people always believed that if the price is high, the product must be very good.  For digital signal transmission, this HDMI cable is more than adequate.  My video and audio were not degraded, and I did not notice any lost of clarity either on video or audio signal.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "A bit difficult to maneuver", "Author": "Sadie", "ReviewID": "R1V1ALC7QFNY9W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I hooked this braided HDMI cable between my HDTV and my computer to stream video from the internet to my HDTV.  The picture is clear and the sound quality is very good.  I don't see any difference while using this cable from computer to HDTV than I do when watching TV directly from my satellite box.  The only problem I have with this cable is that it is very thick due to the braiding, which makes it hard to turn.  I need to plug it into one side of my HDTV, loop it around the back of the TV and bring it out on the other side where I place my computer out of tripping range.  The thickness of the cable makes it hard to loop around and it's heavier than the other cables I have.  This cable would probably be best for professional use where there might be heavy usage and plugging and unplugging of the cord.  It will probably stand the test of time and constant movement easier than the regular smooth vinyl cables.  But, for normal home use, the vinyl cables are easier to handle.For anyone who has not used an HDMI cable and is new to HDTV, this cable can be used to hook up your cable box, DVD or Blu Ray disc player, computer, Wii, sound system and whatever else you have that has an HDMI cable connector.  You do not need to use separate audio cables as this beauty steams everything through it.  It's super simple to use - just plug it in to your HDTV and plug the other end into the other component and play.  I suggest getting HDMI cables for each separate component so you don't have to pull out the DVD cable to plug in your computer.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "HDMI 1.4/1.3x cable, get full support from Amazon", "Author": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R10HLTWUDMM1A7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WHO NEEDS IT?This wire should work well with anything that supports HDMI 1.3x but it's built to comply with the higher HDMI 1.4 standard. You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. Again, on a pair of connected HDMI 1.4 devices, it will eliminate the need of a dedicated audio cable if, let's say, your TV needs to send sound back to your receiver - it may have a built-in Blu/DVD player or get its input through an USB port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future.As far as HDMI 1.4 stands, this cable is 'it'. It's the complete implementation because it supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features.HOW GOOD IS IT?- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.You may want to get this cable even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard and, with free shipping the price difference is not that great. And, keep in mind that Amazon stands behind this product so returns should be easy.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Basic Cable at a Good Price", "Author": "Michael J.

It is backward compatible with other HDMI gear (mine all are HDMI 1.3 compliant). And it will be more useful to you if your TV supports HDMI 1.4 networking. I was not able to test the Ethernet networking capability of this cable, but I think the idea behind it is a good one.For my current home entertainment setup, I had to set up separate Internet connections on my TV, set top box, Blu-Ray player, and WD TV LIVE (HTPC). It would have been a lot easier if I could have just set up my TV's internet connection, and allow all of my components to share it. That's what HDMI 1.4 promises to let you do--as long as all of your hardware, including the cables, supports it. This cable will support that functionality; it's more \"future-proof\" than the HDMI 1.3 cables I have been using.Learn more (and see nice diagrams) at [...]This CableThis cable is really long, so I don't recommend it if your components are very close together.

The specs have changed over the past few years and we're now up to Version 1.4. This new version includes some important changes to the 1.3 specification:* A new 100Mb/s HDMI Ethernet Channel* An increased resolution capability3D formats and resolutions up to 1080p are therefore supported. Note that Deep Color capabilities were already present in HDMI 1.3.The cable for HDMI 1.4 will fit into the HDMI slot on older equipment. That is, if you are using an older TV, processor, Bluray player, or other device that does not utilize the 1.4 specification, you can still use this newer cable. If you have a brand new 1.4-capable device and use a 1.3 cable, you may or may not get the high resolution and you won't get the Ethernet capabilities. That latter issue is only in the 1.4-spec cables.Digital is quite different from analog. With digital signals, you either have the signal or you don't. As you know from digital TV over-the-air, the picture is either perfect or it's missing entirely. There's no in between as there was in the old analog transmission days. With that in mind, there is almost no difference between a high-end expensive digital cable and an inexpensive but well-constructed digital cable. Either the picture and sound will be flawless or it will be missing. There's no need to spend a lot of money.So here we have a high quality HDMI cable that meets the new specifications for HDMI 1.4 that will be of interest to most folks. It has the high speed capability (this will allow 1080p, and note that SOME HDMI 1.4 cables are not high speed) AND it has the Ethernet connectivity.Using an Oppo BDP-93 Blu-ray player and a Sony 3D monitor, bypassing my processor which is not 1.4 capable, I found this cable to work without any difficulties, providing the connectivity as desired. The cable itself is not so stiff as to be difficult to maneuver and 10 feet is sufficient to allow the cable to easily reach your home theater gear if your setup is nearby to the TV. I noted that the cable is promoted as being \"braided\" but the exterior of the cable I received has a solid coating...no big deal, of course, since I never see the cable once it's in place.So ... the right cable for the right price for all your newest 3D and Blu-ray equipment.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "fantastic bargain for a high quality basic cable", "Author": "Rudolf Schmid \"nmnori\"", "ReviewID": "R9S7U92LNCCSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic price for a quality cable, whether used for just HDMI linkage or also for the other options (Ethernet, 3D, Audio Return).

Qafisheh", "ReviewID": "R2CD6FAX0QEA3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife & I use this in our new place with her computer that I bought her. It's got an HDMI out. We do have a smart TV but I fiddled with that feature when we first got our TV & it's a dumb feature. Coneecting the HDMI to her computer takes literally 5 seconds. My smart TV function takes 10 to 15 seconds to launch, then you gotta go through some menus... whatever. I don't have the time or patience to deal with that everytime we wanna hook up her computer to the tv.When connected to her computer, the tv fires up the super crisp image immediately. We've used the cord to watch movies, wedding & honeymoon videos & pictures, etc. We needed a 15' one so that we can comfortably sit on the couch & use the laptop with the long HDMI cord plugged into the computer & TV. The setup works VERY well.Picture quality is awesome with this thing, audio is very good too. My home theater receiver is from 2000, it does not have HDMI capability, Only optical inputs. I have an optical out from the TV running to the receiver. I've tested the audio from a souce that ran 5.1 Digital Digital output to the receiver then compared to the audio the receiver put out after receiving the non 5.1 signal from the TV. It was VERY similar. It was not as good, I'm sure, as if I had an HDMI receiver that would be able to use an HDMI out from my TV, but I'm not too worried about getting 100% 5.1 audio from watching a quick video on the TV off the computer. The rear surround speakers still put out audio, it's just not as defined as it would've been had I had an HDMI receiver. I thing when there's an optical link somewhere in the HDMI connection, it prevents 5.1 & downgrades it possibly as part of that DHCP business.All in all, super nice cord, high quality connector ends. The cord itself is nice & fat, a good sign. Lots of shielding, I'm sure. To use & put away, our cord has contoured to a certain pattern of how I winded the cable when not in use. It's pretty easy to get it to go back to the coiled pattern after we're done using it each time. We then just tuck the coil under the left corner of the TV in the TV slot of our big bookshelf style entertainment center. I really like this cable & would very much recommend it if it's something that your particular setup is calling for.***EDIT - 2/02/14 - I was still curious & not definitive/ entirely convinced about the HDMI in (to the tv, source is the Comcast X1 cable box), optical out (running via an optical cable from my relatively newer 60\" Sharp Aquos to my old-school, circa 2000 Pioneer 500w home theater 5.1 Dolby Digital receiver). The 1st article I came across after Googling this issue instructed to see if the tv has an option in the set-up menu to change the audio out from PCM to Dolby Digital or raw. There, indeed, was an option to toggle it & it actually worked on my set-up :D The option, though, was not in audio settings on my tv menus, as one would think... It was under the \"system options\" menu then under \"terminal settings.\" Then there's an \"audio setup.\" It was on PCM, I switched it to Bitsream. 5.1 Baby!!! I'm pretty fortunate to have caught this now & not much later down the road. I've had the tv for about 4 months... Better late than never I guess.***EDIT #2 - From time to time I'll listen to channel 703 on my Comcast box. It's the EDM (Electronic Dance Music) channel in the block of music channels. Actually, the audio sounded like s*** when ouput in 5.1 Dolby Digital. It was severely lacking lacking subwoofer bass. So I switched the signal back to PCM just for this application. The bass was back & it sounded a lot better. The Bitstream setting works better for movies & shows that output 5.1 Dolby Digital. For music channels, the PCM output is better. Think about it, most music is simply in stereo with some bass. So it makes sense that the PCM output would be MUCH better for music.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "AWESOME", "Author": "Lucas Allen Seidel", "ReviewID": "RKMVQJFMM9LFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is way cheaper and works just as well as the $59.99 Monster HDMI cable BestBuy keeps trying to sell me.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "great price and great hdmi cable", "Author": "Geek Queen \"Geek Queen\"", "ReviewID": "R3LJKTCBKUALM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use HDMI cable in my classes all the time when I teach or meet with students.

I've purchased about 5 of these abs they're simply amazing! They're equally as good as a high priced hdmi cable. If you want proof, google why hdmi cables don't matter on cnet and they have a compelling article about how and hdmi cable, regardless of supposed features, are all the same quality. There is no reason to buy a monster cable or any of that crap.Now onto the product, first of all the packaging is very simple. Just a cord in a bag. While this isn't the most aesthetically appealing, it lowers production cost thus making it cheaper for you and me. There cord is thick which makes it feel sturdy and able to hold up over time.As for this cable, it is a RIDICULOUSLY low price for a great quality cable! Not only does this cable FEEL great, it LOOKS great too. It's one of those products that just makes the user feel like it's the perfect product to own.

No muss no fuss.Although the Amazon description includes a nifty reason not to worry about version numbers, this cable is in fact HDMI version 1.4. You can google for HDMI version numbers to review what features are version specific. There isn't a very good reason to 'future proof' your purchase by buying a higher version than you really need unless you are upgrading your equipment soon.

Now this week, they have a number of approximately 3-foot HDMI cables \"on sale\" - their sale prices ranging from $15.00 to $50.00(!).Take a look at this AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (3 Feet/0.9 Meter) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard]. Its current price is only $4.99.Is it as good as the ones sold at the \"Big Box\" store? Let me just say that an HDMI cable is an HDMI cable. Some of them \"look\" much fancier than others but what counts is the construction and the performance.With an HDMI cable, there is no \"it mostly works.\" It either works or it doesn't work.This AmazonBasics one works perfectly.As a matter of fact, AmazonBasics' other HDMI cables (I have a few of varying lengths) ALL work perfectly. And they are all constructed to a very high standard. I have never had ANY AmazonBasics cable fail.Thus I can confidently state that AmazonBasics HDMI cables in general and this one in particular are as good as they get.Now, if you choose to buy from the \"Big Box\" store, you will have \"instant gratification.\"If you order from Amazon, you may have to wait a couple of days or so.$15.00 up to $50.00 for \"instant gratification\" or $5.00 with a bit of waiting?The quality is the same.

Fortunately, it didn't sound quite right, so I took a little time to look into it.  The short answer is, with a couple of minor notable exceptions, HDMI is digital; you're getting 0's and 1's, not what you used to get with an antennae.  If you get a good picture with a $6.00 HDMI cable, the picture won't be any better with a $60.00 one.  If you have your cable provider come in to do any kind of new connections and they provide an HDMI cable (mine did), it most definitely isn't with a $40 gold plated brand name with assorted bells and whistles one.The exceptions are with cables that run inside a wall, and that's a building code issue that has to do with shielding, not data transmission.  The other possible exception (note the term \"possible\") is on longer cable runs (30' or more) where impedance might (note the term \"might\") be an issue.I bought two of these Amazon Basics ver. 1.4 (ethernet capable) cables for my brand new (2012 model) 46\", 240 hz, 3D, WiFi TV and for my brand new WiFi Blu-Ray player.  Regardless of what the salesperson tries to tell you, all signals come to the TV 60 hertz.  The 120 or 240 hz conversion happens inside the TV, once the 0's and 1's get there.  3D is also just 0's and 1's.  It all happens inside the TV, not as a result of the HDMI cable.  The TV and the Blu-Ray work fine.  Including shipping, I paid less for these 2 cables than what 1 would have cost at the retailer I bought the TV from.Amazon, is by the way, shipping these in cardboard boxes now, not the PIA plastic clamshells.

I think if you're willing to pay the extra money, you won't be disappointed.Being that it's 6.5 feet long, there's the issue of what to do with the extra cable.  It actually folds back on itself quite well for a cable this think.

If your looking for a solid HDMI cable that provides for the lastest in digital quality and performance look no further. You won't get any better performance out of a more expensive competitor. That is just the nature of HDMI's digital signal. If the cable is rated for your application whether it be Deep Color, high speed, 3D, etc and your HDMI port(s) on your applicable devices are current to the standard of cable you have purchased your cables digital signal will provide the quality and rated performance you crave.That is just the nature of the digital signal HDMI provides. Unlike analog cables digital cables don't degrade the signal over the length of the normal run found in typical cable lengths. The basic rule of thumb with a digital signal is if your getting a signal your getting all of the signal. While there have been upgrades to the HDMI minimum standard of performance to provide for newer technologies such as 3D. Many manufactures far exceed the minimum standard of rated performance or specifically state the rated performance of the HDMI cable in a more easy to understand fashion by specifically naming the cables capabilities.Amazon Basic cables state their performance applications clearly and provide an outstanding value for their performance that provide excellent value in the industry at their price point. Buyer be ware if your still listening to the sales gimmicks that promote much more expensive HDMI cables that are largely marketed as better cables and a future proof value. While you cannot rightfully say the Amazon Basic cables are better performance wise you most definitely can't say they are not as good for at the end if the day HDMI is HDMI. The simple reason is a digital signal is either completely transmitted or none of the signal is transferred. The only concern you should ever consider when purchasing an HDMI cable is the rated performance of the cable either in terms of the HDMI standard or what the manufacture specifically recommends the cable is capable of providing in terms of technology. Therefore higher cost means absolutely nothing in terms of HDMI performance nor does a particular manufactures name but that popular name may negatively affect the price point significantly.To make the idea perhaps a little more simple to understand think of USB technology associated with your computer. USB originally started as being stated as a minimum standard of performance just like HDMI which was denoted as USB 1.1 and then became USB 2.0 and now USB 3.0. Each newer standard represents a higher minimum standard or performance. In the case of USB the speed of data transfer is the minimum standard of rated performance which has increased as the associated number of USB has risen from 1.1 to today's 3.0. Consider HDMI no different and therefore it is foolish to purchase a more expensive brand of HDMI cable over another competitor that provides the same minimum standard of rated performance. In fact as previously pointed out many HDMI cable manufactures actually exceed the HDMI minimum standard significantly with the cables they sell. Remember it's a minimum standard. Therefore as the HDMI standard for minimum performance is raised your cables may still be complaint but the nice thing about the low price of these Amazon Basic HDMI cables is you can always upgrade for peace of mind without spending a small fortune for a single cable if there is any question. Still yet if the cable performs to your specification it performs and the low price simply makes it better and the best choice.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Constant swapping leads to cable failure.", "Author": "J D", "ReviewID": "R2RPGR73IJNOQ4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Product was fine up until last month.

I have a Toshiba 24\" television on my office desk, I have my laptop hooked up to it with one of the cables to get a second screen or to just use the television as a monitor. I have a Xbox 360 hooked up to it with one of these and a PS3 hooked up to it with one of these. Our son has his Xbox 360 hooked up to our living room television with one. My wife's laptop is hooked up to the family monitor with one. Our daughter's desktop PC is hooked up to her monitor with one and we keep one in the car in case we go anywhere and need to hook a laptop up to a television. They're that good. These cables should cost twice as much as they do, maybe three times as much, but I probably wouldn't have tried them if they were that high.

For me, these were just fine and do everything I needed.The only complaint I have, and it's a smallish one, is that the cable is pretty stiff.

Signal appear to be just as clear as before but then an XBox 360 only puts out 720p or 1080i not 1080p or 4K and only minimal (power only) CEC signals and that TV (unlike the other one) has no ARC.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "It works!", "Author": "R.

If you need a low-cost cable and NEVER move your equipment around, then this is a great buy.There really is no difference whatsoever in a low priced cable versus some Monster brand rip-off.Please, for the love of all that is Holy in this world, do not listen to someone that says otherwise... its a digital signal... eithers its there, or it isn't... it is not analog where there are varying degrees of strength and quality. There is literally absolutely no difference whatsoever.Now, I give this 3 stars because as all HDMI cables it is subject to the same problems: there are so many tiny connections at the plug that sharp bends will pull the internal wires loose from the connectors. Clearly nobody has figured out how to deal with this problem aside from either a 90 degree angle on the plug, or a very small plug that barely sticks out.If your TV is hanging against the wall, then you'll absolutely need a 90 degree plug.

The ARC works great, it didn't at first. Make sure you hook your HDMI cable to the correct HDMI port, one should have ARC by it, mine is HDMI 2. Set both your DVD player and your TV to the correct setting for ARC to work. I went back through several times getting the speakers to work off the TV alone,(with the dvd player on) think it was the fifth time re-checking all the settings before they started to work. Now for the review. Ever seen a close up on a movie that was so clear of a mans face you can count the whiskers? I can now. yep the picture is so clear on my 50 inch plasma I could count all the whiskers. The surround so crisp and clear from feet softly moving across gravel on the ground all the way up to explosions I could feel pass through me.

Some were too black.  Some weren't black enough.  Some just had too much of a rubbery feel to them.  You know what I'm talking about.  It can be frustrating when you spend hours scouring the web to find an HDMI cable with just the right rubber content in the insulation only to open the package and see that the tint and feel didn't match exactly with the picture.  Annoying, I know.I heard about this cable while attending a meeting of the local chapter of HDMICE (pronounced HD MICE, stands for HDMI cable enthusiasts) but was justifiably skeptical.  How could any cable match up to the hype behind it?  I was hesitant, but in the end, my excessive (and somewhat troublesome) infatuation with all things Amazon got the better of me.  My wallet felt lighter, but I felt like a weight was on my shoulders as I waited for it to arrive.  My wife told me I needed to get some counseling, but she's been saying that a lot lately so I don't think it had to do with the cord.When it arrived, I found my hands shaking as I performed the necessary box opening rituals prescribed by HDMICE.  As the rituals removed all traces of bad HDMI cord heeby jeebies, I felt a warmth accompanied by a glowing light worthy of getting a new wand from Ollivander's coming from the cord.  I realized then that it's true what they say: the cord truly chooses the cinemaphile.Suffice it to say, I have ceased using or buying any other HDMI cords from that point on.  I can happily say that this cable is remarkably adept at transporting pictures and sound in the form of digital bits of information.  It also is nice and cabley, which is a real plus in an HDMI cable.

I recently got some cheaper cables from NewEgg, which were extremely thin, flimsy things with hollow, plastic-shelled connectors, and I didn't feel like they would survive a lot of handling, so I got these, hoping they would be tougher.  They are.  The cable itself in nearly a full 1/4\" thick, and the connectors are nice solid injection molded units.  Aside from the brand name, these look and feel like other, more expensive cables, like RocketFish, Monster, etc., but at a fraction of those prices.These days, if you're spending more than about $5 for an HDMI cables, you're getting ripped off.  However, many of those cheap cables look and feel cheap as well; the insulation is hard and plastic-like, the connector housings are hollow sounding and the connectors themselves are sometimes loose.  These cables, while being a good thickness, are still quite flexible, about on par with the much more expensive Monster cables I have, and they do not look or feel cheap in any way.These do support 3D, as that was the first thing I tested with them.  The insulator isn't a shiny smooth coating and thus doesn't snag or cling onto other cables as readily as some other shinier cables would, which makes working with these a bit easier.I also bought some Twisted Veins cables through Amazon, and gave those five stars as well.  They're actually cheaper than these ( I bought a set of four for a total of $8), but for the qualities that matter, these are about the same.

Want to watch a movie in your hotel, boom, HDMI cable.  Need to hook up to a projector, pow, HDMI cable. How about linking up that Xbox you forgot the cable for, whelp, it does that too!+  At 10 feet, AmazonBasics' HDMI is less than a $1 a foot, which is an awesome value.+  The cable is super durable, and made of thick plastic.  It comes with end caps too, probably for shipping, but they keep it dust free.+  Video quality looks superb, and there are almost never audio issues.Cons:-  Basically, at nearly 10 feet, and made out of thicker plastic, sometimes it's hard to maneuver.Other than storage and guiding it into narrow or tight spaces, this cable is a fantastic cable for the money.
