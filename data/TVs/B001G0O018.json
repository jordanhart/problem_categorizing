For this much money for a 47\" LCD, I expect a lot.The colors were saturated and the blacks were dark, just as you'd expect from the LED backlit set.But the blooming or haloing created by the local dimming is just too much. There aren't enough LEDs in the array. So when white text scrolls on a black background like credits you can see a halo around ever letter or word. Then as they scroll, the LEDs turn on and off accordingly and you can very easily see this \"pop\" of the LEDS turning off. You then begin to notice the same haloing around faces in dark scenes. Pretty soon it is all you see.You can turn local dimming off, which essentially turns the LEDs into an always on backlight like all CCFL based LCDs. But then you lose the dark blacks benefits, and soon you realize you paid 50% more for a feature that you aren't using anymore and now your set looks about the same as all the others at far less cost.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Impressive", "Author": "Raja Jaja \"Purveyor of Fine Cheese\"", "ReviewID": "R2XBDVHBK1YM64", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this TV for a week now.  I haven't experimented with white scrolling text to look for the blooming and I almost don't want to.  After working with multimedia encoding and 3D graphics, I've discovered that ignorance is sometimes bliss.  Once you notice something, you can't stop yourself from seeing it all the time (like macro blocks from MPEG compression, motion \"judder,\", etc.).I'll also agree with other reviewers that you really need to play with the advanced menus in order to tune the picture.  \"Vivid\" and \"standard\" are nice for cartoons and anime but are too over-the-top for anything else.  The auto-adjusting setting is a nice idea but in practice is annoying because it pops up a logo to tell you it is adjusting the picture.  I was watching one night and every time I turned a table lamp on or off, the picture would adjust (which would be fine if it didn't annoy me with an on-screen logo to tell me about it).This TV is no Samsung (LED).  I can definitely tell the difference in the local showroom and the Samsungs are very svelte.  But for this price, I don't think you can find anything comparable.  The LED backlighting definitely increases the visible contrast; you'll see blacks that you just won't see on a non-LED LCD.  I haven't seen the blooming or LED \"popping\" that other reviewers have mentioned, but even if I turn off the dynamic lighting, the LED still gives me brighter lighting, less heat and (theoretically) longer life and greater reliability.  Plus, I get bragging rights for a while.  \"Check it out; the very latest in big screen HD tech!\"Speaking of bragging rights, all of my friends have commented about how wonderful this TV display looks, even people who have bought Samsungs and Bravias in the past year.  Considering that I bought this TV at a price that was the same as the non-LED Samsungs, I'm quite happy.  All the technical negatives noted about this TV are probably spot on, but for the price, I don't think I could have done nearly as well with any other TV.  I bought this TV as sort of a memorial to my brother who died just this past Christmas.  He was very into big screen TVs and the latest tech.  I think he'd be happy to see his nephew watching Bakugan in HD glory.", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture", "Author": "Robert Rubeck", "ReviewID": "R1Z8KMEZ2DD98Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not sure why the last reviewer discussed the 47' tv they found for far less, that is true but that's because the other TV's wont produce the picture quality of this TV and this TV blows all normal tv's out of the water.  I saw this TV calibrated in the magnolia room at best buy on the wall next to a pioneer pro elite and the picture quality was in my eyes BETTER.  I have been waiting to pull the trigger on a new HDTV until I could get more HD content and I am glad I did.  As one of the reviewers posted the local dimming can potentially create some halo effects, but my viewing experience has not proved to show this.  The picture quality on this TV is WAY WAY WAY better then any other LCD I have viewed other then the Samsung LN46A950 and the Sony tv with LED backlighting.  I agree that this TV was expensive at its release but as anything in technology if you wait a few months you can get a deal.  I just picked this TV up two weekends ago for $1800 at best buy on sale.  The Samsung is stil $3,000 and the sony is in the $5,000 neighborhood, so at $1800 I couldn't pass this up.  This TV is GREAT!!!!!

For folks who haven't a clue how to set up the picture, there are plenty of sites like sound&vision; or PC world or pc mag who list their particular preferences.The gents who delivered were awesome....set it up and made sure it worked.

Is this TV worth $2000?--who knows cause you can get 52 inchers for less and they are all pretty damn good when compaired to analog.  The 47lg90 has LED technoligy (saves on power), has 120hz speed, 2.7ms response time, a million to one contrast ratio and LG is a dependible company, the picture is supper, the TV itself, with the blue trim is classy. According to a Bestbuy rep he has fewer complaints about LGs than any other brand of TVs.

I got it for $1550.00 at [...] and WOW what a value.  the 120hz + true motion is superb but it does take some getting used to.  And if you don't like it... you can turn it off or put it on low! Vizio and other TV's do not have this feature.  The sound is great, fills the room up very nicely but don't expect perfection, they are TV speakers.  The picture is superb, i have a DLP as well and this picture is much clearer.  The colors jump off the screen and the blacks are perfect! The one draw back is the halo effect, it only happens when the screen is black and there is white letters but this only happens during credits and thats about it so... who cares!?! Get this TV if you can find one, it is LG's first generation LED and it is a good one.  It's got tons of features to mess around, easy to navigate menu, and great looking! Black and blue... YES! very thin, and it also has a very good swivel stand that sold me on it.  The on/off buttons on the TV are touch sensitive and very good looking.  If you can find this TV for under 1800, your golden.  LG did it right and i won't be second guessing my purchase any time soon. 5 stars!", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Picture", "Author": "Wayne Kuhn", "ReviewID": "R1IQ4S9SZZTDLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV because it had an LED back-lit panel.

It took me about 10 minutes to unpack, another 5 to connect, and another 5 to configure. Out of the box, I have zero complaints about the picture settings. So far, the only thing in the image I dislike is the halo around candles/bulbs in a really dark setting. Other than that, this is a fantastic t.v.! You can view the image from any angle and the tru-motion/local dimming features make for a significantly sharp/contrasted image. Once in a while, you get a guy that has been working on t.v.s his whole life and starts bashing every little non-perfect thing about a t.v., but if you work, eat food, and watch t.v., this LG is for you!
