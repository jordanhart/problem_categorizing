I was immediately (next day after purchase) contacted by CANOPY. The representative clearly described all of the plan's many coverages. She answered several questions I needed to undertand about how to use that plan. This was a $2K plasma TV purchase, and I felt that the full FIVE YEAR coverage was worth the money. I normally do not buy extended coverage plans. But five years is a long time, and I've never owned a plasma TV. So, the \"peace of mind\" is worth what I paid. And, I hopefully won't ever need to use it. But, the plan covers lots of issues NOT covered by the competition, and for a longer time. READ THE FINE PRINT CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY ANY PLAN. Some companies just give you a secure feeling. CANOPY does that for me!", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "Vsh", "ReviewID": "R2STXZDUL94WC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't needed to use this product yet, so there's not much that I can say about it from experience claiming an item.  However, I called their customer service beforehand, and they were both knowledgeable and very professional.  More to the point, they confirmed that there is no limit on the amount of money that they will spend on repairing your TV - a policy not frequently found in their competitors!  I am very happy knowing that no matter how many times my TV requires a several-hundred dollar repair, Canopy will always be there for me.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canopy protection plan", "Author": "Big Bob M", "ReviewID": "R3I0VYEKOJLJVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The service (customer contact) was very quick and reassuring.
