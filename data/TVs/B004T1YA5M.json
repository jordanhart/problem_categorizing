{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Otter425", "ReviewID": "R3IZTA2YS8BAGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchase Experience: fine, smooth and painless as always.Product Comments:Size: fantastic - super thin, and light, which enables keeping shoved toward the back of its surface to keep the kids' fingers away from the screen.Picture: Excellent, very crisp (using HDMI cable).  Easy enough to modify settings to get the right picture for your lighting conditions.  My set is in a naturally-lit room and I have had no problem with the picture or colors as a result of the bright sunlight.Sound: fine.  If you just want to watch TV/movies, the built-in speakers are fine.  They won't make you go ga-ga, but if that's what you want, you'll already have (or soon hereafter acquire) a speaker system.Heat: Here's a really trick of the LED backlighting - it produces surprisingly little heat compared to a more traditional LCD.  Most LCDs generate a fair amount of heat, but the LED LCD doesn't generate nearly as much.Dust: For whatever reason, the bevel seems to attract more dust than other LCDs in the house (TV and computer screens).  Dust doesn't collect so much on the screen as around it - odd, but easily dealt with and doesn't affect the picture.Bottom Line: Great TV, especially for the price.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Average Tv with less than average sound", "Author": "Big C", "ReviewID": "R2TYEX9N86N49Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This Tv is a mixed bag of good and bad. First the good. It has a nice picture. The picture has LED lighting and 1080p quality, which gives it a clear picture. It has has SRS TruSurround HD and SRS TruVolume, which would make external speakers sound great. The design is simple and clean. It doesn't get hot, like other TVs I own. The remote it small and comfortable in your hands and it has dvd buttons for compatible players.Now the bad. The sound is absolutely terrible. The Tv can get loud without distortion, but the speakers are on the back of the unit and the quality is bad to begin with. Furthermore, it would not be a good idea to mount this TV to the wall unless you plan to buy external speakers. Problem two, getting external speakers. Vizio's current sound bar is 39 inches long, as are most sound bars. So if you mount this 26\" Tv with the the 39\" sound bar, it looks disproportionately awkward. And if you invest in a home theater system, it is unlikely your going to buy a 26 inch TV. Third, when you turn the Tv on and change channels, the screen turns blue for 1.5 seconds. This is normal for this TV. I don't know why, but this blue screen irritates me for some reason. Finally, although the remote is comfortable to handle, it seems really cheap.My final thoughts, if you need a tv for kids or teenager 14 years or younger, this is a reasonable choice for the price. The picture will be great with a gaming system. For older teenagers and adults, I have to say to pass on it. Look at another 26 inch TV or invest another 50 dollars and get a nicer TV with decent sound.Update:After watching several movies and baseball games on this TV, I decided that I needed to get a sound bar because the sound quality is so bad. Vizio offers two soundbars, the VSB200 and the VSB205. I picked up the VSB205 because Vizio lists it as compatible and was the smaller of the two at 32 inches. I get it home and quickly figure out that it is not compatible. This Tv uses an optical audio out for Tv viewing. Both the sound bars offered by Vizio do no have an opitical audio input. When I called customer service, the gentlemen was surpirsed that these sound bars did not have optical audio inputs becuase most of Vizio's newer TVs offer an optical audio out, which has superior sound quality. He also admitted that it was an error that the sound bar was listed as being compatible. They still have not fixed this error on their website. If you decide to get external speakers, it will likely be a more expensive set up, which doesn't make sense for a 26 inch Tv. I returned both the TV and sound bar.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "About as expected", "Author": "Brogan Else", "ReviewID": "R3OK8D45K5AH4B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got pretty much what I expected with this tv.  I was just getting something to put in the bedroom to replace our old hunk o' junk tube tv.  The sound is horrible, but the picture is pretty good.  The one other thing that sucks is if there's a way to adjust the angle of the tv on the included stand, I can't find it.  It sorta leans back, so if you have it on a surface that is taller, the screen darkens because of the angle.  It kinda makes for watching as you're laying in bed a bit of a strain.

(once you go HD it's hard to go back)..as for the comment about aspect ration from another person.. there is a setting that is standard on most tv's.. it allows for regular tv viewing (like our old crt tv's that were square), it has wide screen and it has what is called panaromic.. this feature keeps the center normal but stretches the pic to reach the edges.. these settings are normal for all tv's from what I see.  When you are using HD on tv's in general, you don't use these features.  But the tv does have the ability to change the pic size in these 3 settings..  The remote has a variety of ways to access it.. at the top of the remote is a criss-cross bar.. click the center of it and it will display all the settings you can adjust. just click the \"wide screen\" feature and from there you can change the size of the screen you are viewing (again this is for viewing in NON-HD format).For the price this is a great tv for the ofc or the bedroom..", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT FEATURES~~~ TERRIBLE RELIABILITY", "Author": "Kerry", "ReviewID": "R3R2TS747KWLJ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is our 3rd and LAST Vizio purchase. We bought a 32\" Vizio several years ago and the picture went out after 9 months. We called the Vizio service department and although they were very friendly, they were never able to correct the problem. \"Service was backed up\". \"They should have called.\" All excuses...no repairs.We threw it away and purchased another 32\" thinking it was just \"one of those things\". The picture & sound quality on Vizios are excellent. This TV has been in daily service and performing perfectly for well over 3 years.When our bedroom 26\" TV failed, we purchased a 26\" Vizio. Problems from the start. It would randomly drop pre-programmed channels. We'd re-program and then a week later it would drop more channels. Service again was friendly but never heard of the problem and offered no resolution. After 4 months the picture went out completely. The tuner must have failed because it now would not program any channels.Why did we continue to purchase Vizio TVs? Great Picture, Great Price but Never again. If you've wondered why so many \"Factory Refurbished\" Vizios are for sale it's because the reliability is terrible.

The only downside to it in my opinion is the slight backward lean on it's stand, yet with the design of the base of the television and the fact that it thins as it rises, the lean is hardly noticeable.

The TV's internal sound is very flat with no base and no treble, but lots of distortion.

Mounting with the wall mount amazon recommends is easy and everything came together fine. The picture looks amazing with true HD content. You cant get a true 1080p rig elsewhere in a smallish size for this kind of money. Its only monster-living-room-sized beasts. The sound is unimpressive, but you will want to output your sound to a 5.1 system via your soundcard anyway. The screen , in conjunction with the tilt bracket is adjustable and is not catching reflections.  I can use it in full light just fine. But all the much better with the lights dimmed. When used as a TV, viewing standard channel definition,(itself with letter-boxed widescreen content) it does not zoom the image, you can only stretch it. You get a black frame all the way around it.  That sucks. But as a video output for a PC, its rock solid.I had this problem with Video Tearing. Thats when your video looks like its torn in half along the middle horizontal and inexpertly put back together with stickytape. It was not the TV at all. It was the Video Decoder on my ZOOM PLAYER 8 (free).  Try switching to an alternate decoder under options.  There will be a choice that works. So using it to play mp4, mkv, and avi files, you can get a variety of content, some good, some bad.  I would say this TV does better than most when your video resolution/bitrate is less that perfect. Some rigs exaggerate the pixelization and posterization that you get with highly compressed content.

You can easily plug in external speakers through 1/8th inch headphone jack or the optical audio out. If you aren't an audiophile and just want to be able to hear the tv, it'll be just fine without external speakers.- The remote is a little awkward when navigating the menu, but after a little use it gets more intuitive- The base is an arch, so it doesn't sit flat across the whole bottom. I was planning on placing the TV on a little stand with the front and back sticking off each side about an inch, but this won't work because the base doesn't sit flat.

Williams", "ReviewID": "R3MO6LONUU6FIJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a Vizio 42\" TV (N420NV) which I love.I needed a 26\" or 31\" TV for our trailer so purchased a Vizio E260NV. I am VERY disappointed with it.I probably expected it to be a lot like the big one I have, only smaller. It isn't. It's not even close. It's like Vizio job-shopped the design out to the cheapest bidder. (Yes, \"cheapest,\" not \"lowest cost.\")Some of these \"features\" one never thinks of before it's too late. And some of them are not easy to learn about while shopping; it's only after the purchase that you learn about them.My complaints about the design:* Since everyone has mentioned it, I'll just list it first to get it over with: audio quality. Sounds very \"tinny.\" 'nough said.* No ZOOM mode! To not have this is almost unbelievable, in my opinion. No zoom means that you CAN NOT expand some programs to fill the screen without distorting the picture! (I HATE distorted pictures.) I didn't know there were wide-screen TVs which did not have Zoom, so I was sort of \"had\" on this one. There are very few without it. Unfortunately, I bought one of them.* Narrow viewing angle. Once you get it, or spend time to look it up, you can learn that the viewing angle is 160* horizontally and 150* vertically. This is the case with a few other Vizio sets, but most are 178* in both planes. The narrow viewing angle is definitely noticeable and was noted by at least one other reviewer here.* The remote control is \"chintzy\" in feel. Physically, it seems they were trying to make it with a minimum amount of plastic, thus it is very thin and light in weight. This makes it hard to use. The cross-button is hard to push and each time I use it, it feels as if the entire remote bends. It probably does! That's not the feel of a quality unit.* In-set menu system. Others have mentioned this, too. The \"buttons\" are almost hidden. Operation seems different than operations I'm used to. Operation seems more conventional when using the remote.Since not all of these issues are not readily observable when purchasing, I'll simply say this: be aware of viewing angle and Zoom function when selecting a set. These DO make a difference!I'm in a time crunch for getting a TV, so probably will keep this one even though I do not like it for the reasons mentioned above.Compared to my big Vizio, it is like a super-poor knock-off, designed by a different company, which in some manager's weak moment got added to the product line.As always, your mileage may vary. These are my opinions on this one model. Remember, I love my 42\" Vizio so I'm not down on the whole company or all their products. I'm just sorry to see this one taint the product offering.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for Gaming.", "Author": "Andrew Harmon", "ReviewID": "RJEUCP3E6AUVC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually bought this TV from walmart but i couldnt seem to find it on their site.

My fianc\u00e9 describes the sound as really hollow. The biggest problem was the fact that the difference in sound level between 1 and 2 and 2 and 3, etc., was just too large. There really isn't any precise control over the volume level, and that is something that I really want in a TV.But, we easily solved this problem by hooking it up to an external receiver and speakers. We now have much more intelligent control over the volume.This TV fits our needs well. We knocked off one start because of the sound quality and the intermittently working touch buttons. We gave it four stars because it has 1080P HD, uses LED back-lighting, it isn't too expensive (we paid around $260 in May 2011), it is the perfect size for our bedroom, and adding on a receiver/speaker system really improves it's worth in our eyes!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent TV at a decent price.", "Author": "Roger G.

The picture is good, though I think I've seen better.  The sound is not as bad as some of the reviews make it seem.  It is plenty loud enough to be heard in our bathroom when the TV is across the bedroom from the door.  It is intelligible.  It is not home theater quality.  You're just not going to get that from such small speakers.  But all TV's of this class are like that.It's simply a design decision manufacturers have made.  They think when people buy an LED TV that is extremely thin and light, they are willing to give up some sound quality and let DVDs be played through a stereo.  So they give you good enough sound quality to understand what's going on.  But if you want good sound quality, you'll need a home theater or stereo close at hand.  Or simply buy a bigger TV that comes with bigger speakers.The only complaint I have is probably due to my own ignorance.  The wall mount I bought is good for all TV mounts - which means it comes with the 100 mm hole pattern in the plate.  That makes the mounting plate bigger than the design of the TV allowed for.  The plate covers up some of my jacks.

So, with the HDMI connection, the screen looks very nice. But that also means that I'm tempted to use the controls on the front of the monitor rather than the remote. They are touch sensitive, and not labeled. You touch any of them and onscreen descriptions pop up. They are sometimes insensitive or over-sensitive, leading to mistakes in reading my intentions. The menu hierarchy for settings is difficult to figure out, but that's typical. It takes two button pushes to turn the monitor off. Sometimes if it is reacting slowly, I end up turning it back on! There is also no way for it to go off on its own when it gets no signal. So the computer can't turn it off by sleeping the output to the monitor.When it does go off, or if you turn it off, (which is really only putting it in \"standby\"), it takes a long time to come back on. It is generally about 15 seconds to warm up. When it was hooked up with VGA instead of HDMI it took longer and often would blink on and off a few times before settling in on just being on.

Be prepared to let it run for 20 or 30 minutes to search for all your channels.  Fortunately you only do this once.2) I don't like how the channels are displayed.

Not sure why it doesn't sit vertically.4) The default display settings are a bit dull.  I had to change the settings from 'Standard' to 'Vivid' in order to achieve a more visually pleasing image.

It replaced my old picture tube television and my DVD player.  I've heard all the talk about LED, HD, 1080p, Blu rays, and I'm sure you have, too.  I got a blu ray player as a gift and didn't want to hook it up to my old CRT television so I went and bought this LED TV.At first glance, the TV didn't impress me because the images were a little fuzzy.  As per recommendation, I went out and purchased an HDMI cable and the display improved drastically.  I picked up a cable at a bargain outlet for 5 bucks.  Now the movies are bright and colorful.  Very nice!In hooking up some older game systems, the screen is still fuzzy using the RCA (red, yellow and white) jacks, but I assume that would be the case with all older systems.  The new Xbox 360 and PS3 should be fine.The sound, like others have said, isn't very good.  Sounds like something you would find on a laptop computer. The sound is clear and doesn't seem to be any distortion, but there's just no bass whatsoever.  Should be ok for a small room though.  The control buttons on the screen are touch sensitive and light up when you touch them, but you can't see them unless you touch them and even still, they are not labeled, so it's hard to tell what button you are pressing!  The buttons are labeled on the LED screen and this is really stupid.Like others have said, the screen is tilted backward and there's no way to adjust it, so I put a book under the back of it to tilt it a little bit forward.  The remote seems really cheap and awkward... feels like it would break easily.Another complaint I have, is that there's no audio output except for some fiber optic port for a soundbar.

I didn't have this problem with the other lcd tv I have out for repair.  I'm not quite sure that that maxing out the brightness control is the right thing to do, having already gone to seventy percent.  I can't imagine what this would be like used as a computer monitor, sitting in front of it.  If it weren't for that \"1080P\", because of the viewing and the worthless sound, I'd return it in exchange for something else......I bought this little \"gem\" of a tv as a temporary use tv while my Sylvania 32 inch year old 720p is off for fixing or replacement on my store bought warranty, but I selected this tv for 1080P only and had to buy locally at Wal mart so I wouldn't miss a show on that night on dish network, and nice that it was also LED lit so I get to experience two of the latest things of max high def and fancy lighting that produces less heat(sure would have come handy this last summer during those scorcher mid days where the sylvania lcd helps heat up the room), and I watch tv in a smaller spare room, so size doesn't mean much to me as long as it aint too small.  As expected, the sound was like a message from the company that nobody is really watching tv generally without a sound system attached, and I used component cable to attach video to the tv, sound patch cords from my satellite receiver and part of the same component cable to my \"tv sound\" port on the back of my stereo receiver, I think I need one of those optical cables to adjust sound on the receiver via tv remote control of the tv.In the box there seems to be offers of extended warranty through vizio, wished I knew about that cause I bought a two year extension service plan through wal mart effective after the one year warranty, hope I won't need it.EXTRA ADDITION:  Of course, I get my 32 inch sylvania back, a perfect tv for my living now since I can see tv from the kitchen or across the room, and there is no darkening or lightening worth even notice to mention like this vizio, I mean, I thought so.  I don't know why the vizio is so view angle sensitive.  No, I'm not inclined to return it, cause I need two tv's right now, and $278 wouldn't get me but a el cheapo lg 32\" 720P standard lcd.  The real trick was the way the display model was on display at Walmart, since display models are always set on \"store\" or some other word, having brighter backlight likely at 100%, something to think about when considering a display model, cause the screen life is supposedly 30,000 hours at half brightness, somehow, I did adjust the angle of view with a book, tilted it straight up and down, and setting the backlighting to 50% custom setting, with 55% brightness, even then I'd like to go to seventy to 75%, but it seems okay for now on most things and I don't want a premature failure cause believe it or not, I'd like to use this for a long time, maybe someday as a computer monitor, or a kitchen shelf tv, when or if I get some sort of tv later that has all the latest bells and whistles and is fourty inch or much larger, I mean, I'm bout to retire to the trash in pieces a philips magnavox Nov 1999 32 or 36 inch(very heavy), seems like I paid $300 plus dollars for that thing back then, and it didn't have but 75 ohm connector and composite connectors in(yellow, red/white), so television longevity is important to me, and should be to all americans, it just isn't acceptable that any tv $300 and over should only be worth two, maybe three years.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "SPEAKERS", "Author": "TOMKAT", "ReviewID": "R3MDU5S5V6AP5X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had to return this set the speaker/sound system sounded like a forty year old transistor radio.

However, I was curious to know how it would work as a computer monitor. The price was right, so I took a chance and purchased a refurbished unit specifically for use with two desktop PCs running Windows XP Pro (one with an HDMI connection, the other with a standard VGA connection.) Set-up was simple, and it didn't take long to realize I had made a very good choice. I was extremely pleased, I'd almost say astonished, at how clear, sharp, and brilliant images and text display, through both HDMI and VGA connections at full resolution. It took a bit of manual adjustment to achieve the optimal image, particularly with the VGA monitor, but I don't consider that a flaw.The generous array of connection options is a boon for those with \"legacy\" equipment-- it even has an S-video connection, which is quite rare on LED/LCD flat panel monitors.As for the audio: in my opinion, expecting rich sound from such a low-cost unit is being unrealistic. Vizio put their money in other features and skimped on the speakers, so it does sound cheap. However, through external speakers and/or headphones the audio is quite acceptable.The stand, as others have noted, does indeed cause the screen to tilt slightly at an obtuse angle, which is a design flaw (unless the designer expected that most people would place their unit below their line of sight.) To solve that I placed a shim (an old book) under the back foot of the stand.At this point I haven't owned/used the unit long enough to know if it will endure daily use as a computer monitor.

It works fine and the picture is pretty good for the money; the sound isn't that great.I purchased this 26\" TV for my dining area so the quality wasn't a huge factor. I'm pleased with it.One VERY important thing to keep in mind is the mounting. The design in the back for the wall mounts is poor. Standard wall mounts with two separate vertical attachments will simply not work. The vertical attachments will not lay flat due to the video connections in the back protruding. The mounting area in the back of the TV are low, close the connections. I had to return the wall mount I purchased and had to get an \"X\" style, one-piece, mount that didn't interfere with the connections. Before attaching the one-piece \"X\" style mount make sure you plug in the power cord first, or else the mount will prevent you from connecting it after it's mounted.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tv", "Author": "MauiLady01", "ReviewID": "R2QW8PLJLUNW3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV alone has sold me Vizio products.

I get a NO SIGNAL error, and the red-white-yellow cables fall right out of the ports. It's disappointing, although I realize that for $250 I shouldn't expect much.
