The bad first: the sound is terrible, but that seems to be pretty typical with a Vizio from my experience. Also, the remote does not have a backlight, which annoys the you-know-what out of me. But, really, it wasn't a deal-breaker to me because all of the components this TV has is hard to find at a decent price as this is. Being a smart TV with wifi, you have access to Netflix, Hulu, etc. through built-in apps. And really, you can hook up a computer or laptop to it for other online streaming that is either \"off limits\" to certain manufacturers (HBO Go anyone?), which makes this a good choice for me. I also like the fact that this TV is white - it looks much nicer than the standard black/silver/clear - but I do have white trim in my bedroom, so that won't necessarily be for everyone. Overall a good picture - and I hooked up my laptop to it as well to test it out, and it produces a good picture for desktop viewing as well. If you happen to have a little soundbar sitting around that you aren't using.....I would definitely pair it with this TV, and it would be excellent.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "fired my cable provider", "Author": "k", "ReviewID": "R9Y9FSDMIA80Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fired my cable provider and love it.

The picture is great and the web TV features work smoothly. The TV is quick enough to turn on and change channels and the remote is nice. It's really attractive looking and a slick package.The stand is just strange, and because the TV has limited viewing angles, it makes a weakness into a big flaw.The thing that will have me returning this though is the terrible speakers. What is the point of streaming music, movies or watching high def if the sound is just low quality. I fault the Vizio designers for not thinking this through. I noticed the 29\" model in black has speakers with double the wattage. I may try that model as, again, the set is really impressive in many respects.UPDATE - I bought the 29\" model in this series and the sound was improved because of the more powerful speakers.

Color: White which is better than the usual Black.Apps on the Screen: Not many apps available. I find it a pain having to key in one letter or number at a time. There is no pointing device. I would have to give the apps 2 out of 5. Is there any possibility to add more apps and remove those factory preset apps? In other words, can I customize the apps to my liking?Wi-Fi Connection: I do not know why every time I switch off the TV and then turn it on, I have to re-input my password to get connected to my router? How come the TV does not \u201csave\u201d those settings? The wi-fi antenna was quite sensitive in picking up neighboring signals including my own router with 5 bars out of 5. So for that, I would give the Wi-Fi 4 out of 5. I docked one point because it would not save my router password. It was a pain every time I have to key in my password to get connected. Is there any chance for Vizio to allow us to attach our own external Wi-Fi card to connect to the router?TV Tuner: I find the ATSC tuner quite sensitive. It was able to pick up most channels (taking into consideration other factors such as placement of antenna, time of day or night, weather conditions and the power of the transmitter.) I would give the tuner 4 out of 5.Tuner Functions: I find it peculiar that I cannot do a direct access channel input to receive a channel. It would not allow me. Why so rigid? I have 2 other TVs that allowed me to key in, say channel 17- to scan for a digital channel. Let\u2019s say channel 17 is the physical channel and the virtual channel is 62.1 and 62.2. I would have to go to Menu/Settings/TV and then do a Partial Scan to get those 2 channels. Why so long winded? I had to do multiple Partial Scans because I had to place my antenna at 2 different locations to receive all the available channels. I cannot do a Full Scan because it would mean that some channels would be lost when I do a rescan. So for the poor logic in forcing users to do a Partial Scan and not allowing direct search, I would have to give the tuner function 3 out of 5.Also, say an existing channel, 25.1 (physical channel 33) was already scanned and saved in the system and later the station decided to add another sub-channel, 25.2, the tuner will not automatically display 25.2. You will have to do a partial scan on channel 33 to get 25.2. It will say, found 2 digital channels and then you could do a channel listing by pressing OK and see that channel 25.2 was added to 25.1.My other TV is able to automatically display channel 25.2 without me having to do any rescan. This is because 25.2 is a sub-channel. Should a new channel is launched in my area; I could just key in the physical channel number and add a dash for digital, e.g. 18- and I will get e.g. 69.1, 69.2 and 69.3. I find this channel scanning by Vizio very rigid and illogical.Wish List: The TV only came with one HDMI. Vizio should at least give us 2 HDMI ports. One HDMI for connecting a DVD or Blu-Ray player and the other HDMI could be used to connect a game console or satellite tuner, etc. My 14\u201d TV has 2 HDMI ports. Why only one USB? There should also be 2 USB ports, one for connecting a mouse and the other to connect a SD card using a card reader or pen drive. Why no Bluetooth? With Bluetooth connectivity, I could connect a headset without being tethered to the TV. Also I could connect external speakers using Bluetooth.Remote Control: I find it puzzling that the INFO button and GUIDE was the same function. When I pressed the GUIDE button, it displayed whatever INFO was telling me. I could not get upcoming programs, e.g. the next few hours on that channel. I can only get what was showing currently. My small but humble 14\u201d TV was able to tell me upcoming programs for the next 12 hours when I pressed EPG.Also, when I pressed the INFO button, it did not display the signal strength of the station. My other TV was able to tell me if the signal was strong average or weak. I find the engineers at Vizio forgot to take care of the little things that could mean a lot when designing the TV functions. After all, most functions are now written in Java and can easily be updated by flashing the firmware. I hope they could give us an updated firmware to make the functions easier to use and more logical.Why no MTS or SAP? It seemed that Vizio has forgotten the basics. Almost all TVs nowadays come with both CC and MTS functions. This TV is not for the disabled. I do not understand why there are so many CCs. There are four CCs and 6 CSs. Only CC1 and CS1 worked. So if the program is in Spanish, then CC1 will display the dialogue in Spanish. For English channels, CC1 will display English.Why must I press so many times to turn on CC or to turn it off? Why cannot I just toggle it to CC ON and CC OFF like most other TVs. All I needed to do is to go to settings and then set up which CC to use. So if I wanted Spanish, I select CC4 and CC1 for English. Then I just press the CC button and toggle it from CC OFF to CC ON and automatically the CC will be in Spanish or English as the case may be. Simple! Hence I will have to give the CC and no MTS or SAP functions ZERO stars out of 5.Other functions or rather Non-Functions: No Favourite Channel List, non-existent Electronic Program Guide which is so basic. The Channel List is activated by pressing the OK button on the Remote Control. It displays all the Channels in a single page so it is very tedious to scroll down all the channels if you happen to have many. On my small 14\u201d TV, the channel list is displayed in pages. So if there are 35 channels available, there will be 4 pages. Each page will display a maximum of 10 channels so I could just press \u201cright arrow\u201d or \u201cleft arrow\u201d to move to page 2 or 3 and then \u201cdown arrow\u201d key to select the desired channel. This is faster than having all channels on a single page. I have a broken TV that also displays pages with 7 channels per page. Why put everything on a single page?All things considered, I would say, the TV could have been better. Although the picture and sound was above average, the lack of certain functional features was apparent. Overall performance: 2 out of 5. I kept this TV and did not return it because of the sound and picture quality plus the sensitive ATSC tuner. Otherwise, I would not hesitate to return this TV and ask for a refund. I needed a replacement TV and so I bought this one thinking that it would be better than the broken one but I was mistaken. I will be keeping my 14\u201d TV as a backup in case this Vizio TV goes kaput after one year.My Conclusion: Certain functions or non-functions really need improvements. The design, navigation and logic offered by Vizio did not quite make sense. Too much thought was put into the Internet part and too little on the basics. As they say, it is the little things that make or break a product. I suggest Vizio R&D; go back to the drawing board and redesign and redevelop the product and if possible give us a patch to download and update the TV\u2019s firmware.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but some issues", "Author": "lion13", "ReviewID": "R2RMJU7PDQDIB7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a good TV , great image, fairly priced but here are the \"cons\":1- Poor wifi hardware: Netflix and Hulu had several time loops between the broadcasting, no matter that the Vizio its just 10ft away from router, a Panasonic smart tv that is 50 ft away from router, doesn't present this issue2- Dead pixel, I've had this Tv from 2 months now, and it showed a dead pixel in the center of the display so it's bad...real bad3- When you power it up, It takes like 20 seconds to show some image and almost 1 minute after it shows image, you are able to log in into netflix or hulu or amazon, this is annoying sometimes.This is good for a kitchen tv", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "DOA", "Author": "R.

I've been playing around with the controls and it's better. At first, most of the preset visual settings made caucasian faces look bright read. I could adjust that with a custom setting, but it got washed out. Played around with the backlight and that helped. Still, not a good picture on many shows. It varies based on channel. Sports and news are fine.The Sound: what everyone else said...my 15\" sharp was far better. I didn't think it would bother me because I'm not using it for music, but I am going to get a sound barRemote: No backlight and I watch tv in the dark. I have to have a small flashlight on the bedI have to turn on the cable remote and the Vizio remote. With all my other TVs, I just use my cable remote. I also cannot use the cable remote for volume as with my other tvs; maybe I hooked this one up wrong but it's annoying to use one remote to change channels and another for volume.For the price this is okay, but I wish I'd spent a little more to get a better picture and sound.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good TV", "Author": "Augustine P.Gebeh", "ReviewID": "R3BSP3R5RTMR0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This babe is perfect for kitchen or a any busy room.
