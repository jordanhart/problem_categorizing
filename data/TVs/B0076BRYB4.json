The TV would not turn on with remote or turn on manually.  Now after over 6 weeks of waiting for parts to come in to repair it, they tell me that it might be 6 or 7 more weeks before they GET THE PARTS IN FROM CHINA. I asked why the ad said they were made in US.  He says they are assembled here but all the parts come from China.  What's the point of buying a new TV if it quits working after 3 months and they say they can't gets parts to repair it.  What good is this one year warranty???", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely worth it!", "Author": "Frank Udero", "ReviewID": "R14VMHWXK7898A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking to get at least a 50 inch TV for quite a while now and I knew they would come down in price after the Super Bowl and March Madness.  Just had to be patient.  I didn't get it at Sears like others here have but I did find it here and a couple of other places (Wal-Mart which was about $15 more because of shipping).  I got it here for $770.I was hesitant at first because I hadn't really seen any reviews anywhere.  However, I've had very good experiences with Amazon so I wasn't too worried.  I just want to say that, so far, it's been absolutely worth it.The delivery driver called about a half an hour before he was to arrive at my house.  He showed up early as my scheduled time was noon to 3 PM and he arrived at 11:55 AM...Wonderful!  We unpacked the box, put the stand on and connected it to my DVR to make sure all was good.  All the while the gentleman was very pleasant and didn't try to up sell me anything of which I was most appreciative.The TV itself is gorgeous, the picture is very clear and the sound (my biggest concern as I didn't want to have to get a receiver/speakers) is very good.  I've only had it over the weekend but it's got everything the more expensive models have.  All kinds of settings that I'm sure I'll never even need to touch but it's nice to know they're there.One last thing that I really need to comment on is the TV Guarantee that Amazon provides.  Basically, if you can find what you purchased cheaper somewhere else (along with some other conditions) you can get a refund of the difference.  I was in luck!  Amazon itself had lowered the price by about a $100 less than what I had originally purchased it for.  I submitted all the info that was needed (not really that difficult...URL, price and shipping) and within a couple of hours was contacted that all was good and I would be credited.  Very happy with the entire transaction from beginning to beyond end.  Thanks again Amazon!", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "ATexasBean", "ReviewID": "R2BO2XIVWMA6SE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I also bought this item during Sears sale, and got it after taxes for $600.  Like the other reviewer mentioned - thats an amazing price for a 55\" 1080p with these specs.  I've been very pleased with the quality and the ease of use.  I think the real test will be to see how it stands up over time.  If the unit continues to perform over the next few years at this level of quality without any problems, it will will definitely be a 5!!", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV from the US of A", "Author": "Essaray", "ReviewID": "R1X5Y4AMBE43JJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased my Seiki and am amazed at the quality of the picture.  I suppose it's the 1080p, or because navigating the menu and setup are world class. I work at Sears and have many other sets to compare to, yet, still I'm amazed.  I've learned that Seiki is designed and assembled in the US, which is unusual this day and age with most everything coming from across an ocean or two. Since it is made here, I have the added benefit of knowing that I am helping rejuvinate the US manufacturing markets with my purchase.  The prices that I see are ranging from $699.00 to $799.00.  I purchased mine during a sale at Sears where our entire stock went for $588.00.  That's unbelievable for a 55\" 1080p LCD (Even on Black Friday).  Believe me when I tell you this unit is top line at less than half the price of other manufacturers. I feel good about my purchase and anticipate many years of great performance.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "A decent quality tv for a competitive/good price.", "Author": "Joseph D. Fisher", "ReviewID": "R3IA3YR6DEDLJ4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this as a discontinued item at a retail store , & because it was discontinued I got a good deal for it. I bought it at least a year or 2 ago & it still works. You must be wondering why I gave it 3 stars. Right out of the box I started having problems with one of the speakers which still does not work properly to this day. I also noticed that the screen is not true black and has a type of black/grey type color. Both Problems are a sign of poor materials or craftsmanship or both. Because the speakers are pointed down the volume is not perceived as it should be if speakers where installed forward facing the viewer(s) in question. I eventually bought a good samsung sound bar with a bluetooth subwoofer to try to fix the volume & speaker problems. It sort of fixed the problem to the point where if you watch tv with the soundbar it makes this glitchy incompatibility sound where it sounds like digital tv snow, but the sound bar works properly if you use the tv for anything but watching broadcast tv. I do use the tv quite frequently & I do use most of the hookups for other devices connected to the tv. The a/v hook ups located in the back of the tv are easy & convenient to use in which they are located on one side of the tv pointed out sideways which is nice , though the a/v hookups are spaced too close together. The picture quality is pretty good. Something to keep in mind though concerning watching broadcast television, no matter what tv you get the broadcast signal will usually be compressed resulting in a low quality picture if you are watching a signal through a catv/cable line, even digital cable you can tell the quality is not full hd. The only way to watch broadcast tv & still get good picture quality is by getting one of those hdtv antenna's & watching tv the free way due to the uncompressed signal being received. There are better tv's out there, though the price for this tv is quite a bit lower than competitor's tvs of the same or similar size screen. I would recommend a tv like this for people that are on a tight budget, but are looking for a big screen television.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 55\" TV for the money- a bargain", "Author": "Jolynn Herzog \"Jz\"", "ReviewID": "R3KPM4K78MINRH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I didn't get mine on Amazon, saw it at sears it was only $599, and a year ago when I got it, there was nothing this big for this price.

Couple work around problems are, it only has a digital sound out, so I had to buy converter for about $30 to use some analog speakers.

The problems start if you're trying to do anything other than watch TV on it.  Audio in, coaxial, etc do not work on this tv.  I have tried multiple devices and cables and nothing works.

The price was reasonable. I had gone looking on Amazon and Sam's Club for LCD TV's and this was the best price for the size. It would have never fit in my car.

Knotts \"swingdady1\"", "ReviewID": "R37GCA0CC506MG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am moving and in search of a large TV for my new living room. When I saw a 55 inch HD TV at this price I was blown away but having never heard of the brand I was skeptical. I put my better judgment aside and purchased this TV.After setting it up I immediately noticed it had a very strange picture quality and content looked like it was shot on very poor quality cameras. (I was watching Breaking Bad and X-Men on ATT Uverse and my Playstation 3 respectively). The picture was not pixilated or dark just very odd. After searching the internet I found numerous people refer to a specific problem with this TV they called the Soap Opera Effect (SOE).That was it! That is exactly what this TV makes everything look like, daytime Soap Operas. The actors or foreground objects are over exposed and the background is blurry and out of focus. Everything has an odd tint to it too and you are prevented from adjusting the tint in the TV's menu.I noticed with Blu Ray and DVD content the Soap Opera Effect was the only problem but with TV, especially on non HD channels the picture saturation would randomly change and movement would become distorted making watching anything very frustrating.The audio is not great either. To get any sort of quality sound out of the TV I had to connect the audio out to a set of old computer speakers I just happen to have.Bottom line, avoid this TV at all cost. In less than a week I returned this TV and for an additional $38 got a 50 inch LG Plasma. Sure it is smaller and cost more but it is infinitely better that the Seiki TV.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big Bargain TV", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R13VYWG4MW4ZS7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "55\" seems to have become the standard size for a living room TV these days. This TV doesn't look that bad from the front for a bargain TV, but it is almost 5\" thick which is quite large this day in age for LCD TVs. One guy said the picture was amazing, I beg to differ. Yes it is 1080p with 120Hz, but they did not include any of the hardware/software to make proper use of any of those features. This TV doesn't care about the fps or any other statistic of the incoming source. It doesn't work well in a bright room, as expected with a bargain TV, but I can't say it works well in a dark room either. Meaning it is not good at whites or blacks. This TV is essentially gutless which I would be fine with if it was a 40\" or less for <$400, but this is a decent sized screen which make the issues more noticeable. Now if size and LCD is the only thing you care about then this is a great buy. I feel my money is better spent on a 40-46\" LCD screen with better picture/audio or a just go over to plasma which is cheaper than LCD because it is, in the TV years, old technology. A good alternative to look at would be Samsung PN51D450 51-Inch 720p 600 Hz Plasma HDTV (Black) which comes in 51\" or the LG 50PA4500 50-Inch 720p 600 Hz Plasma HDTV which comes in 50\".Overall not a bad TV, just I feel a person could make a smarter choice.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$999.99", "Features": "54.6 in. diagonal screen with full HD 1080p resolution\n120Hz panel refresh rate\n6 ms response time\n2 surround audio speakers (5.6W)\nEnergy Star TV", "Name": "Seiki SC-552GS Energy Star 55 Inch Diagonal 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with 3 HDMI", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51toJrbUuxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0076BRYB4"}}
