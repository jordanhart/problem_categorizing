{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great looks, grating sound", "Author": "M. Zankich", "ReviewID": "R1PJOEIWJX9SUZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just picked one of these sets up a few days ago at a club store after seeing its price just a couple hundred over the LC-46D65U I've had my eye on for the last year or so.  The screen is good.  No dead pixels, no blurring issues that I can see, and best of all, no perceptible input lag with my xbox.  (this is the feature of the Aquos sets that was my primary interest in them)Out of the box, the image quality was quite good but in need of tuning.  The colors are not oversaturated as with many televisions.  The menus are intuitive and easy to use so it took just a few minutes to adjust the temperature to what looks right to me.  However, after 3-4 attempts, I still haven't struck the right balance with the gamma, contrast, and brightness.  I am a little bit of a nut over these, however, so I wouldn't consider it a fault of the set.  Overall, I would say the image quality is excellent.Sound quality is terrible.  I mean, it is embarrassingly bad.  I have never heard a TV with worse speakers.  And the TV that this is replacing is an Olevia that couldn't play in stereo without major distortion.  This set is worse than that.  The sound is tinny and shrill.  It is about as high in fidelity as the cheap transducer in a laptop computer.  There are menu options to adjust the bass and treble up and down, but even with treble cut as far as it'll go and bass set to the max, there is little to no change in the atrocious noise noise this thing puts out.  The best I can guess is that the expectation by Sharp's marketing and engineers is that this set was never meant to play its own sound.  Graciously, there are audio out jacks on the TV.  If you have a home theater set, this is a non-issue.  If you don't, be sure to budget in a decent set of powered speakers.  The built in audio is simply unusable.The input/output jacks are plentiful.  I count 5 HDMI's, 2 YPbPr's, 2 RCA's, a VGA dsub, an s-video, and a serial port, as well as a stereo 1/8\" jack, and as I meantioned, it has the ever-so-necessary audio output jacks, both in RCA and digital form factors.  One HDMI port, one RCA input, and a USB service terminal are situated on a side panel, keeping them easily accessible for temporarily installed devices.  The rest of the jacks are on the back of the unit, off to one side, with the power jack on the opposite side.  It would have been nice to have these closer together and nearer to the center of the chassis.  The included power cord is a measly 4 feet.  I had to reorganize my runs around my entertainment center to accommodate this.  It's not a major issue but it is needlessly annoying.  If you don't have a plug immediately behind the set, you're going to need an extension cord.The remote is neither the best nor the worst I've used.  It's an awkward shape and I don't like the positioning of the channel and volume buttons but the buttons have a nice feel and the controls are instant and responsive.All in all, I would say that it is a good set.  The case looks good, the picture is crisp, clear, and fluid, and it's loaded with everything necessary to be the centerpiece of a solid home theater system.  The minimal screen lag is great for gamers.  The terrible treatment they've given the audio system precludes this set from being a standalone piece, however, and if your interest is in getting the most TV for your money, remember that this is not complete out-of-the box, and the savings it offers over comparable quality displays may well be eaten up in the purchase of a listenable audio rig.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Picture and overall value", "Author": "Redryder", "ReviewID": "RCUCSK73IJQJ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from local club store last week. I believe the club stores are the only place to find this particular model number, but from the research I did online, it is identical to the 52E77U.Setting up the TV was extremely easy. First you have to attach the stand, then just plug in the power cable and your inputs and turn it on. The first thing that you see when you turn it on is an initial basic setup menu. Once you go through the few questions, then you are all set. I did spend a little time tweaking the settings as you would have to do with pretty much any TV you buy. I found a site that had some users posting their settings and I tried a few of those. I then made a few more adjustments and I found what I feel is the perfect setting combination. The picture quality is truly amazing, very vivid and clear, and everything in HD is just phenomenal.As far as sound quality, I have not listened to the speakers at all as I am using a seperate receiver for the sound. I would not expect much in the way of quality as these types of TV's are built for picture quality, not sound, and really, I'd be fine if they did not even have speakers.I cannot find a single thing to be negative about with this set, except for one very odd quirk. With my setup, I have my cable and PS3 running to my ONKYO receiver, which then has one output to the TV. Whenever I first turned on the TV, I got a message about sound not being compatible. I had seen this mentioned on another site, and all I had to do was turn the TV's volume control down to 0, and I never get the message.One final thought. While doing research on Sharp LCD TV's, there was some mention of banding issues. Everything I could find said this issue was resolved and limitted to some run of screens at one of the factories. I have not noticed any flaws of any sort with my picture. I highly recommend this TV, at least, for the price I paid for it, you get more value than comparable Samsung, Sony, etc. models.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worked Well at 1st", "Author": "Robyn E. Webber \"Tweetssun\"", "ReviewID": "R2INQTIVWQI27V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my first big screen/flat screen TV purchase. I spent so much time researching and trying to find the picture quality thatI felt looked the best for my needs as well as making sure it would not blur when I was watching the scores on ESPN scrolling on the bottom. I was happy with my TV for the 1st year. The 2nd year, I had moved and was having cable issues (and apparently TV issues, but didn't realize it at first since the cable company said it was their fault). It took the cable company almost a year to fix all of their issues, when all of a sudden one day I was watching a movie on Netflix with our XBox. I started getting the same issue as before. The TV would flash black then it would flash to snow, then black, then to snow, etc.. The only way to fix this, was to power everything off, and back on. Sometimes it would be fine for a couple of hours, sometimes a month. Lucky for me I had an extended warranty through the club I purchased this set at. 21 days before it expired, boy was I cutting it close.It was assumed that it was the Main Board that was causing my issues, as well as the poor sound quality that we had. The sound was not as much of an issue, since we have surround sound. Apparently there are a couple of part #'s associated with this type of TV, and it was narrowed down to 2 based on my TV's serial #. The club warranty required the TV Repair company to come out to get the exact part #. Then it was ordered and they came to repair it. This was done the Thursday before Memorial Day '11. On Memorial Day, the TV went back to it's same old business of black then snow, then black, then snow. I left a message with the repair shop as was advised by my tech, to give them a heads up, and then I called the club warranty people back on Tuesday. Ok, it could have been a faulty part. I understand that this sort of thing happens from time to time. Another part was ordered and a new appointment set up for my tech to come back out to my house. It was replaced again on a Monday and on Tuesday the Club Warranty department called me to see how everything was working. So far so good I told them, but of course, it was always an intermittent problem so only time would tell. Later that day, and 1 hour after my personal warranty rep left the office that day, it started back up again.Now it was even worse than before. The screen turned black, then snow,then just stayed black, then clicked. 5-15 seconds later the picture returned. I contacted them back up, and was told that my rep would contact me in the morning, but to call if anything else happened. 2 hours later I was back on the phone with them, because NOW it flashed black, and the power and the OPC light kept flashing and the picture would not return. The only way to solve this was to turn the power off. The remainder of that night we went through a period of this TV turning it's picture off from 5-15 seconds and back on... sometimes as often as every 5 minutes, sometimes it would last an hour. The next day, it got even worse. All of a sudden the picture went off, and stayed off, no blinking lights, just no picture. It would fade to a lighter black shade back to a darker shade of black. I turned the power off and back on... picture was STILL off. This lasted for over a 1/2 hour. It did it again the following day, this time for over an hour.The club warranty people stated that this was being escalated and they would be contacting Sharp. Sharp had already been contacted the 1st & 2nd time that we encountered this problem. Sharp's answer was, send the TV repair man back out to the house so he can witness the issue, and call the Sharp Tech's while it is happening. The manager at the repair place knows how frustrated I am, and she said she was discussing this with my tech and they both agree that the TV just needs to be replaced. The manager was so frustrated that she contacted the shops owner at home to let him know what was going on with my TV. Lucky/Unlucky for me we were able to record all 3 issues going on with the TV to share with our tech. We did this for our tech on Memorial Day when it broke, and when he saw it, he was like, yup, that's the main board all right. Something else must be wrong to cause this main board to keep breaking. The shop owner is interested in the error codes (flashing OPC & Power Lights), well we have it.I searched the internet to try to find out what these \"error codes\" meant, and ran into a whole bunch of people having very similar problems to mine. Some right away, some JUST before the warranty expired, or some just after. I would HIGHLY suggest to NOT get this TV. This TV is no longer sold at the club where I bought it at, so I hope I can get it replaced with a different brand TV if I must get it there. If I get a check of some sort, I will be purchasing a different brand TV elsewhere, and I will DEFINITELY be purchasing a 4 year extended warranty. I am just glad that I was given a 2 year warranty free through this club. So far I would have spent over $400 and counting to this repair company. I really think that this repair company has done everything they can to try to get my TV to work.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love of my life.

Why this TV is selling for over 2k is beyond me. It is over $1,000 overpriced here. I got the TV and extended warranty and shipping and set up for $1,400. This is just FYI.The Review.Over the time I have owned this TV I have had nothing but good things to say about it.When I first opened the box I was blown away at my first big screen TV. I assembled it by myself instead of allowing the delivery crew to do it because I wanted to. In hind sight I wish I had asked one of them to help set the screen on the stand because it was almost too heavy for me to pick up by myself.I got the TV set up on my computer desk and plugged my computer to it and I used the TV as my main computer screen just next to my bed in my room. I also had my x-box 360 connected to it as well as a 500watt surround sound system. I had a 30\" hdtv next to it as my secondary TV.The built in sound system in the TV is actually not that bad for a small room.I noticed that when using my screens as monitors for my computer that the sharp had about a half of a second slower image speed than my smaller screen.This however was not a problem and I was able to play my fast paced first person shooters with no problems at all.The color on the screen is great I have zero dead pixels and I never had strange lines or artifacts on the screen.There is an army of connections on this TV. You will never find yourself wishing you had more connections. I am a technology fiend and even I couldn't fill all the connections on this amazing TV.Cons.The TV is large and therefore uses quite a bit of electricity and gets a bit warm but never hot. It's Heavy.The remote control is flimsy and the buttons feel unresponsive.The on screen options could have been a little bit better.The auto adjust brightness feature is junk.I am shocked to hear that anyone has had anything less than an amazing experience with this TV. I would recommend it to all my friends and family.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "ONE DAY BEFORE WARRANTY EXPIRE, HDMI STOP WORKING!", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R3MZXBJYC2UL77", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just one day before 12 months since I purchased all HDMI connection stop working, called Sharp and purchased a 3 year extended warranty for 3 years (I guess you going to need).Now I need wait they send the contract so I can call for a repair.My last TV was a SONY, ten years problem free...when this one stop working (probably day after the 3 years extended warranty) I will buy SONY or SANSUNG again.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "missing parts", "Author": "sublime \"Sys admin\"", "ReviewID": "R2JN715HDOCFNU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy refurb from sharp.
