You really need to adjust the picture settings on this TV (duh). Doing so will result in exquisite picture quality. I had heard that this TV gives \"flagship quality at a mid-range price\" and I am here to confirm that; Game of Thrones on Blu-Ray looks absolutely incredible. (Skip to the end of this review for my picture settings)2. Virtually no input lag for Xbox games (crucial for FPS).3. IR (image retention) has not been an issue whatsoever, even after playing Xbox games with a static HUD for a few hours at a time.4. I am disappointed with the sound quality, mainly because other reviewers said it was better than most other TV's in this price range. While this may be true, in the end I consider it to be barely useable. However, when spending well over 1K on a TV you should probably invest in some sort of sound system also.5. Buzzing has been nonexistent thus far, will update if I notice it.OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:1. Stand does not swivel.2. Very slick styling; looks great in person.3. Remote looks like it was made for a 1998 geriatric technology convention. (who cares about the remote, dude?)4. There is no questioning the excellence of Amazon's customer service, but the \"scheduled delivery\" is worthless. Mine was scheduled from 9am-12pm. When it finally arrived at 5pm (lol) the driver said, \"Nothing runs on time with freight.\" So be prepared to block out a whole day to receive this item (keep in mind this was my experience, not sure how common this is?). Amazon did give me $60 store credit for my troubles.5. I have not had any problems with the ABL (automatic brightness limiting), but I do not watch hockey so if that is your thing then you might want to do more research.6. I am not evaluating the wifi capabilities or apps because I connect to wifi through my Xbox and stream everything through it.PICTURE SETTINGS:-Background (for semi-noobs like myself): it seems many people use D-nice's picture settings (he is a calibrator that posts on the hi tech junkies forum). He recommends downloading some picture prep slides that he posted and running them for 100 hours to evenly age the phosphors on this TV.  I didn't do this, mostly because I'm lazy. Other people use David Katzmaier's settings (he is a calibrator and reviewer for cnet). Ultimately I decided to place my settings exactly between these two \"expert's\" opinions because neither hit it dead on for me. Keep in mind these are dark room settings and that my TV hasn't been \"properly aged.\" Frankly I don't care because these settings look perfect to me, but I may need to readjust in a few months if some \"aging\" occurs.-Picture:Picture Mode: CustomContrast: 80Brightness: 58Color: 46Tint: 0Sharpness: 0 (yes, turn this all the way down from 50)Color Temp: Warm2Photo Enhancement: OffC.A.T.S: OffVideo NR: Off-Pro Settings:Colorspace: NormalW/B High R: +5W/B High G: 0W/B High B: +2W/B Low R: +8W/B Low G: 0W/B Low B: +1Black Extension: 0Gamma Adjustment: 2.4 (I dropped this from 2.6 because my personal preference is slightly brighter)Panel Brightness: MidContour Emphasis: OffAGC: 0-Aspect adjustments submenuScreen format: FullHD size: Size 2H size: [grayed out]Zoom adjustments: [grayed out]-HDMI SettingsLeave all settings in this menu at their default-Advanced picture submenu3D Y/C filter: Off [grayed out]Color matrix: HD [grayed out]Block NR: Off [grayed out]Mosquito NR: OffMotion smoother: OffBlack level: Light3:2 pulldown: On24p Direct in: 60HzHope this helps!!", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic plasma is the way to go", "Author": "TechGuru", "ReviewID": "R336TQOS85LLDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received this p55st50 tv on 3/6 from Amazon. Must be amongst the first few owners, ordered without looking at one in store as not available to date. Amazed by the picture quality, black levels and popped up colors.I have owned a 42\" panasonic plasma for last 7 years and has always found it superior in natural color reproduction and movie picture quality when compared to LCDs.It was a time to upgrade. I did look at some LCDs but never found them any close to plasma in natural color tones and movie picture quality. I think Panasonic offers the best quality plasma amongst very few plasma manufacturers left in market. So picked p55st50 which is at competitive price, superior than last years best rated vt30 and offers most features from higher line ups for 2012.Here are few major features stood out to me. Will add/edit later.. - Amazing picture and color quality. Noticeable improved motion smoothness, vibrant colors - profile is prettey slim. Around 1.5\" thik. Thickness is uniform from top to bottom exept the edges on all four sides are thinner. The bezel is better(thinner) than last years st30 model. There is a clear plastic extention around the bezel which is not enhancing the the look and I guess is added to provide protection against any damage to the edges. There are no buttons on front of the pannel only the remote sensor the power light and I guess a ambient light sensor. The power, volume, channel and menu buttons are on the right side back of the pannel which easy to access when needed. The black bezel is almost non-reflective and offers no viewing distraction as I have noticed in some other brands. The new antireflective screen appers to be working well. The screen itself displays very less reflection even while watching in birght room with big multiple windows - 3 hdmi(1 with arc), 2 usb inputs on left back side which I guess are more than sufficient as most wouldn't hook up more than 3 hdmi sources and those who do and invest in this expensive tv would also have a reciever with multiple hdmi inputs.  - Out of the box the colors were displaying some tint/non-natural tones but after changing/adjusting settings they are looking great. I might have noticed this as I am used to watch a 7 year old plasma. Now actually I started liking the popped up colors and they are definitely look attractive when compared to LCD displays. Black levels and details in dark are amazing. Haven't seen as deep black levels in any other tv yet. I preferred cenema mode for bluerays and custom for HD cable. SD videos showed some pixalation but that is expected on a 55 inch large display. Some lower resolution DVD and SD videos are not as sharp as on my old 42\" 480p panny again the magnification factor of 55\" display is to blame. But most dvd video with good resolution were displaying perfectly without any pixalation. I was blowen away by the picture sharpness for blueray and hd cable channels. - Did not notice any of the issues like fluctuating brightness, fbr discussed for 2011 panny tvs in various forums - Very easy and simple set up  - Installation was quick (except - two people needed to lift and slide the panel into stand. Understandable considering the 55\" size). Set up was very simple and intuitive. Connected via 5GHz wireless. There is option of connecting via ethernet but so far I am not noticing any bandwidth issues on wireless. - The viera connect and internet features are great. DLNA support is amazing. Could connect to ps3 media server application on my pc and stream some dvd movies with dolby 5.1 sound. Browser wasn't installed out of the box, but could install it from viera market. There is android and ios app to control the tv as well as browser from smart phone. - Netflix HD movies looked great. Was no way to determine the resolution but picture was clearly hi defination, better than dvd format, no buffering/stuttering. - There are plentey of movie streaming apps including amazon, vudu and others some subcriptin based some free. - Other than movie streaming and browsers no other viera applications I guess are much useful. There are weather, news, fitness, game applications out there but I think smartphone/tablet is better device to access them. - The new advertised 8 train speakers with 3d sound - I checked out the tv sound , was crystal clear, with some sourround effect but not something which will replace your 5.1 sorround system. I have Onkyo 7.1 system and the sound was no match to Onkyo. Quickly switched back to Onkyo. Plugged ps3 and cablebox to reciever via hdmi and used optical out from tv to connect to reciever for audio from streaming, audio/video applications, sd/usb streaming. The optical out from tv is passing dolby digital signals but as from online forums the optical connection can pass only two channels. Good for most but if you want all the channels when available you will need hdmi cable with audio return channel and a supporting reciever.- The browser and  the touch pad on android phone to control browser doesn't looked like fully baked in. The cursor is very difficult to move/control. Moves very slowly. The browser also wasn't easy to navigate around. Hopefully Panasonic comes up with updates to browser and phone application to address these areas. The android remote application is fully functional and very handy except the cursor control. Could project photos from my phone onto tv.I wasn't able to control the cabel box and ps3 connected via hdmi using the viera link. I guess only panasonic products are supported. Would be great to get support for other devices to cut down on number of remotes.No new compatible Bluetooth 3d glasses available yet. I tried 3d in store on last years gt30 and it was looking awsom. Expect 50 series perform better in 3d display.So overall", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "You will be amazed.", "Author": "Jason T.", "ReviewID": "R1GKKZ7QWLKN12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is what will happen:You will receive your TV, open it immediately--admire its beauty momentarily, inspect it for physical defects, realize that it is indeed factory mint, plug it in, turn it on, mind blown.  Well something like that. I have heard professional reviewers say there is no such thing as a perfect TV.  But, this has to be the closest thing.The Design:I spent 30-45 days doing research on what TV to buy for the basement of my new home--I went from looking at only LCDs (a mentality that is really 3-years old now), to debating between Samsung and Panasonic Plasmas.  The research on reviews/pricing was clear--Panasonic's mid-range model edged Samsung's in terms of Quality/Capabilities.  Still--this TV sits in the primary entertaining room in my new home, and the 2011 Panasonics just looked dated.  Even though I could have save $200-300 by going with last years model, the glass trim and slim profile are just sooo Hot, particularly on a wall mount.  Not too mention--the TV shed 24 pounds (or 28%) from last year's model. It differs slightly from the comparable Samsung's as the bottom two corners of the glass trim are cut at a 45 degree angle rather than rounded like Samsung.The Picture:I have had this TV for a little over 2 weeks now.  I use my TV for PS3, TV (Dish), Bluerays (some 3D).For Video Games:  Truly stunning--I play a lot of FIFA 12 (soccer video game), it is fascinating to watch an airborne soccer-ball spin with complete lifelike detail. Zero Blur. Zero Ghosting.  I use either the 'Vivid' or 'Game' picture presets for videogames.  Colors are more rich, and the screen is a little brighter--good for Cartoons and Video games-- but a little to blue and bright for lifelike pictures.For HDTV/BlueRay:  HD quality is perfect--you can see the goosebumps on human skin clearly, colors are just so real, and motion is perfect. There are no distractions pixelation/blurring/motion--the picture is seemless, and you can just enjoy the programming.  I used the custom David Katzmaier recommended picture settings for HD/Blueray Viewing.For 3D:  Maybe, I have not experienced enough Active 3D to compare, as reviews have said this may be a hang up for this TV.  But in my experience, the 3D is just mind-blowing.  The image loses none of its real life quality. Their are ZERO headaches--I've watched Avatar 3D twice, once with my wife, and neither of us experienced any crossover, ghosting, or any of the other problems that make us loathe going to 3D in theaters.  3D viewing is just stunning.  Even the 2D-->3D feature--although it lacks the depth of the true 3D content--has no problems.  I use the Katzmaier settings and the new Panasonic Blue Tooth 3D Glasses for viewing 3D content.The Web Content:I found Viera Connect's interface to be extremely easy to use, and liked how I could still see what I was watching as I explored the Online apps.  Set up took two seconds when I first turned on the TV, and I usually acheive 1080p quality even when streaming previews from Hulu or Vudu, and the picture is as good as my Dish HD Channels.  I have not bought any movies this way yet.The only hangup: It really does need a separate sound system for a true media experience.  There is just no bass or lows from the built in speakers, and the sound is a little hollow.  I also noticed the TV's speakers do start buzzing (distorting) when I would raise the volume above 70 (of 100).  I did get a sound system--and it almost brings tears to my eyes how great my in-home entertainment system is for all under $2000.  I jest about the tears.Bottom Line:  Unbelievable TV--Unbelievable Value for Top of the Line Picture/features.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Started out great.  Went bad after less than a year.", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R31Y11WELQ97W8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I Returned 6 led tv's over the past 3 months. All had problems with the picture.  I finally decided to try Plasma and boy I'm glad I did.  No backlight bleeding, blooming or screen uniformity issues.  Panny makes a great set with extremely deep blacks and a wealth of picture settings.  The web options and apps are easy to navigate.  I also like the stand because you can adjust the tilt slightly as most other sets tend to lean to one side or the other with no way to make adjustments.  Motion is extremely quick and smooth and I actually prefer to turn the enhance motion feature off. This set is well worth the money.  Please take my advice and think twice before purchasing LED sets, especially if you're a TV purist.  I use to be a Sony loyalist and I am now converting everything over to Panasonic solely because of this set************update*************After a  year of owning this TV I'm going from 5 stars to 1.  This TV has really bad burn-in issues.  Issues that can't be corrected via screen wipes.  I still like Plasma picture quality over LED so I'm thinking of trashing this and going with another brand- maybe Samsung.The other problem is with Netflix and YouTube.  Netdkix has audi sync issues and intermittently doesn't work.  There have been no new software updates in close to a year.  If anyone can reccommend a good plasma, please let me know.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the picture on this set", "Author": "Joseph Richardson \"Gamer\"", "ReviewID": "RYF9EMF7HPUAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received and hung my p55st50 and after a fair amount of testing I can say without a doubt this is the best plasma set I have had in my home and I have tested a lot over the last year.  I had an unfortunate incident with my p60st30 from last year (cracked the panel) which is why I picked up this years model.ST50 vs. St30ST50 is has much better black levels. They are so deep it is hard to tell if the TV is turned on with no signal.  Unlike last years model which had good blacks, this set has outstanding black levels.  Best I have personally witnessed on a TV. With controlled lighting the side bars blend in with the bezel of this set and disappear.Brightness:  This set gets noticeably brighter than my ST30 but not at the expense of picture quality such as over-saturation of colors. I never really felt like I could dial in the ST30 to my liking.Reflections:  I had all of the light turned on in my viewing space and this set is MASSIVELY better at handling room reflections in comparison to the ST30.  It does so well that it is almost like you are watching a TV with a matte screen and not a glass one.  Pretty amazing.  You will want to ensure that you hang this set so that it is either at the center of your view or a little higher,  not lower.  The anti glare works by dampening light from top to bottom and you would loose image quality if you have to look down to view it.Clarity:  Much cleaner looking and clearer looking image with both still images and motion.  I am pretty astounded at the overall image quality upgrade between the st30 and st50.  It has all of the good characteristics of the Samsung plasma line.  Great natural color, clean noise free image, nice bright picture and elegant modern design with the benefits of what I feel Panasonic has always done better  (Black levels and Motion)  The ST30 sometimes had a dirty image depending on the content. This set handles inferior signals much better.So to me this new set is literally the best of both the Samsung and Panasonic worlds.  Think of it as a cross between the VT30 and D8000 which to me is a perfect blend.I did not notice any buzzing which plagued my ST30.  Minimal line bleed which was also and issue on the Samsung models and the ST30.I have not tested nor do I care to test the Viera Connect features. There are many cheap alternatives to using your TV set as a media hub that do it much better than a TV will.  I purchased a TV for one thing and one thing only,  its picture quality and performance and I have never been more impressed.  Panasonic upped their game in a big way this year. I don't see how anyone could be unhappy with this TV if picture and performance are your priorities.  This set is such a big improvement over last years model in a strange way I am almost happy I broke my old set  (sounds awful but it is that big of an improvement)I am still debating if I want to return the 55st50 and get a 60st50 but either way...it is an awesome plasma.Amazon: OUTSTANDING service.  I ordered this set around 4pm Monday and was hanging on my wall at 9am this morning.  Flawless process as usual.  Great professional delivery.I have returned and purchased tons of items from Amazon and there is not a better online vendor to deal with.  I can't say how impressed I am with this last transaction.  A big thanks goes out to Amazon.EDIT:  Decided to swap out the 55st50 with the 60st50.  Can't go wrong either way. As usual Amazon was extremely easy to work with concerning the swap.  the 60 will replace this 55 in about 6 days.EDIT:  Have been enjoying the 60st50.

It wrecks LED's. The brightness is great, the smoothness is unbeatable, and the image retention has been virtually non existent for my moderate game / TV use.The only drawback to buying this TV is the complete loss of a social life and contact with the outside world that comes with it. But in a world where people put leashes on their kids, and sweaters on their dogs, maybe that's not a bad thing..Not to mention it came looking and working like it was brand new.

Goldstein", "ReviewID": "R27NXRK4DH8O37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Out of the box, it was decent, maybe even good. I went on high def junkies and followed dnice's 100 hour screen prep (I used the wrong settings for the first 20 hours, but they weren't drastically off from the correct ones), then input his settings and I cannot possibly imaging a more purely perfect picture.Zero buzzing. I has strongly considered the Samsung until i read all the buzz buzz bad reviews.For anyone who has brightness/glare concerns, this screen is plenty bright and there is very little glare. I live in an east-facing top floor corner apt which has seven large windows (4 on the east wall, 3 on the south wall) and I have a 20x20 skylight; my apt is very bright. Not an issue whatsoever. The screen does an amazing job of filtering out over-head light. If you walk up to the tv and look down on the screen, it becomes extremely dim, which is exactly what you want from an overhead view. As soon as you walk away, the pic is perfect, especially at or above eye level. Viewing angles are good for all angles (except for looking directly down on the tv from point blank range); very clear.The sound is very good for a television, but I have a 5.1 set up, and I recommend the same to all.The remote control is a pos. I don't really care, I'll get a harmony or something.The picture is so incredibly clear and real. No over-saturated colors, not retina burning over-brightness. It simply looks perfect.I did about 20 hours of research prior to making this purchase. in the early going it struck me that I might be able to get a huge tv, with one of the best pictures, considerably cheaper than the rest of the competitors. It didn't really make sense until I continued reading and reading. Eventually it just became clear that most people have NO IDEA what they are talking about when it comes to tv tech.Here's some of the things close friends and family (who claimed to be in the know) had to say  (all idiotic, and completely uninformed):\"You can't possibly consider plasma any longer. It's too f@#king heavy and the picture goes bad after a time. LED is the way to go. I've been thru all of them, and LED is plainly the very best, the thinnest, the lightest, etc.\"\"I would go with OLED. So LCD is a thin display with an LED backlight thus there are no \"true blacks\" as there's always bleedthrough. For OLED, when the individual OLED is showing black, it is actually switched off completely. The only downside, but the margin is thinning, is the lifespan of OLED monitors. If you're not watching much though, then who cares. It also costs a little bit more. But it's the most cutting edge of the three. Plasma just cold sucks.\"\"LED--no brainer\"\"it is a tv, not a work of art! What are you looking for it to do for you? just buy a cheap one that will fit where you want it to and don't look at it as na investment.\"\"I looked at all of them this spring, to me the LED was a better value. Go to tigerdirect.com, see if you can find a deal.\"\"Plasma is the oldest technology and supposedly the srcreen eventually burns out. I have one of the originals and it is still awesome. LCD is newer technology, LED the latest technology. Both have better viewing angles. LED is the brightest picture and I think the best technology now with the widest viewing angle. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. They are all good. The differences are mostly diminimus.\"\"Patrick & I bought the hype and purchased a 60in LED. It was great for hockey but made movies look like home videos. It was a deal breaker. Took out back and got a plasma. No looking back.\"Do not listen to your idiot friends and family. They are merely parroting the nonsense that they hear other people say. Thank (fake) god I didn't listen to anyone and did my own research. And by the way, the tv is like an inch and a half thick. How that is \"so big\", when it is sitting on a wall ten feet away, is beyond my comprehension. Who cares if LED's are light and thin, are you carrying your tv to and from work every day?If you read all these reviews (and comments), and then do a bit more reading on avsforums and hidefjunkies, there is no way any reasonable person can come away with anything but complete certainty that this tv is a screaming deal, and more importantly, one of the best pictures available, at any price point.JasonUPDATE:Two weeks later, I need to alter my review regarding brightness/dimness:1) Watching Game of thrones using DNice's settings, I found the picture to be a bit too dim, to the point that I had to search for an alternative. I tried Vivid, which for most viewing is way too fake and saturated but for Game of Thrones it seemed pretty good (for SNL it was awful and DNice's settings were perfect). Cinema mode was also better but the colors were not as ...errr colorful. Game mode was also decent.2) In a brightly lit room on a sunny day, Dnice's setting will be too dim for almost everyone. The other settings worked pretty well though and I'm still very happy overall. I would like to find a new setting which i could overwrite one of the default settings so I could use that in day light hours, and then mostly use DNice's settings in night time hours (with the exception of Game of Thrones or other fantasy based programming, where color saturation actually seems to fit the content, as opposed to the news or SNL where real colors seem more natural to the eye).I'd love to hear some feedback on this.Jason", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic needs to let users disable ABL!", "Author": "Walter", "ReviewID": "R21OHMBJBNQ9K9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this after going through two Sony NX720s and a near top-of-the-line Samsung plasma. The NX720s had flashlighting issues, while the Samsung suffered from ABL, or automatic brightness limiting. Unfortunately, the ST50 suffers from ABL as well. Last year's models apparently got an update that allowed disabling it, but no such option exists on the ST50 yet.Most viewers won't be affected by ABL, as it only really comes into effect when there's a lot of white or near-white color on the screen, at which point the screen dims noticeably, with whites looking more like grays. Some people have dubbed this the 'hockey effect', since it's going to constantly dim the screen while you're watching a hockey game. Myself, I like to hook up the computer and play movies or browse the web. The moment I put up a window with a lot of white, the screen goes dim.Aside from that frustrating annoyance, this is an excellent television set. Contrast and blacks appear to rival the NX720 from my experience, and the exterior design is much more tasteful and trim compared to last year's models. The on-screen menus aren't as slick as the competition's, but I rather like the no-frills style, and the menu organization is probably the best I've seen.Two minor gripes: the controller feels cheap, and there are only 3 HDMI ports. To get a fourth, you'd have to pay another $350 for the next step up, the GT50. At least for the 55 inchers. But overall this really is a fantastic TV, rivaling more expensive LEDs in contrast and blacks, while having much better viewing angles and no flashlighting.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great 3DTV for the price!!!", "Author": "Nathaniel P Drury", "ReviewID": "R27TKJC1VUE63F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is my detailed review of the Panasonic TC-P55ST50:To start things off, I have never own a plasma or lcd screen television. I personally was on the Samsung DLP hype for the longest time due to the fact that if something were to happen (i.e. picture issue) I more than likely could fix it without professional help. Well two bulbs and a need for a new DLP chip (White Dots, Google it if you are unfamiliar with that issue) I decided to shop around for a new TV around my b-day. This television really stood out to me in many ways. I have defiantly had enough time to tinker with this device to give a decent rundown. I was really wanting to wait and hold out until the 4K glasses-less 3D TVs were going to come out, but hearing what everyone was saying about having to sit directly in front of the TV (sweet spot) for everyone to see it seemed kind of ridiculous. Oh and who has roughly $11,000 for a TV anyway...For starters, putting together this television required very basic look through to put together. I personally put it together by myself in about 20 minutes. Yes this thing does weigh about 90 lbs. I was skeptical at first lifting it by myself but everything worked out for the best.Once I turned on the the television I immediately updated the firmware to make sure I had everything possible at my fingertips. Honestly I have yet to use the built in apps. This is due to the fact that I use this mainly as my living room computer monitor/man cave television. Netflix, Youtube, Pandora are either used on other devices that are equipped to my surround sound, so I really have no use for them. However, If you personally do not have access to devices of that nature (xbox 360, ps3, ect.) then yes it is a good thing to have. The interface seemed a little slow, but I hold nothing against that as you didn't buy the TV just to have use applications.I was \"cautious\" with the first 100 hours of play on my TV. There has been no \"burn in\", but even if there was, hell that is what an extended warranty is for.The picture quality is really good. Mess with the settings people! Some reviewers have indicated that the TV is \"bland\" with the stock settings. That's why you customize the settings to your liking. There are many different guides out there that have \"ideal settings\". Uncompressed 1080p video looks great. I have already watched about 20 blu-ray movies and they look wonderful. Black levels are great. I must say 1080p footage of anything looks great, probably not as good as something like 4K, but that's about a year from now. For people who like the 600hz feature, like myself, (i.e. - the \"Soap Opera Effect, whoever came up with that term in a moron) it is nice to view internet video the way it was suppose to be (i.e. 60+fps... you can thank Youtube limits for that) as well as television programs normally shot at film 24fps. You can turn it off, or decrease/increase the strength of motion smoother through the tv's options. If you want free content in 3D go on Youtube and enable the Side By Side 3D effect if possible on videos. Then manually set your tv to 3D SBS through the 3D button and the red button the in the center of your remote.  It at least will give you the idea of what 3D looks like as 3D blu-rays are CRAZY OVERPRICED!!! Wait for those to go down or just rent them online from one of the 3D blu-ray rental sites. 3D blu-rays look really good too. Toy Story and the new Tron looked really good! Again the media is limited to what is out there but it is a very cool feature. BTW Avatar is not sold as is on 3D blu-ray at the time of this review being written. You have to get it 1 of 3 ways. You can buy the ridiculously overpriced 3D glasses set (thanks panasonic!), go on Ebay and pay roughly on the high end of about $100 for it, or you can wait and eventually once the exclusive rights are up, buy it by itself.The big factor for this that most people want to know about is the 3D. Is it worth it?I would say yes. I do like the 3D. DirecTV offers a few 3D channels for you to view. Sports and documentaries look great! I can see a future with those for sure. Gaming on this TV is mind blowing in 3D. The PS3 offers many titles to view in 3D. Does it make you a better player being able to see depth and judge things differently? No. It does however let you see how detailed the programmers get with these games are lets you view them in a different way. I did have to move the in game sliders to find that \"sweet spot\" so I didn't feel like I was going to go cross eyed. I hated the effects at first but realized the effects were just too high. I never really experienced those \"headaches\" people have reported. The Xbox 360 does do 3D but Black Ops is really the only game I would play on it. Before I forget, I do need to mention that playing video games on the home consoles does limit (atleast the 10 games I tried) to 30FPS. Not a deal breaker, but for Call Of Duty players who like 60FPS you will see a difference in game play.To add to the 3D, the 2D to 3D effect is ehh.... It really doesn't do much, maybe the higher end models it might as the have face detection but no it really doesn't do much.The audio... well I wouldn't know as I have my Onkyo receiver to do that. Other reviews have said that the speakers are decent for TV speakers.Inputs you get 3 HDMI, 2 USB, an SD Card, a component adapter to plug into the TV, and a coaxial plug. You does have an optical out, but I will never use it.Overall I am very pleased with this TV. I am glad I future proofed when I bought my Onkyo HT-S5300. It is nice having one remote control all devices. Keep in mind to do 3D you need HDMI 1.4 cables and Panasonic active shutter glasses. The glasses are lower in price than they were in the past. I was lucky to receive two during a special one of the \"Big Box\" stores was having. You can order then through Amazon and please for the love of god order HDMI cables through Amazon as well.

Upon hooking up my new TCP55ST50, I discovered the HDMI plug #1 did not work, and the HDMI plugs #2 and #3 only worked intermittently. This meant I paid for a high definition tv, and the high def did not work.I contacted Panasonic and they said a local authorized Panasonic repair shop would contact me directly. A week later, I called Panasonic and they said they were still waiting to hear back from any repair shop in my area (San Diego). Another week later, I called Panasonic again, and was told there is only one authorized repair shop in the entire San Diego area, and they were still waiting to hear back from them. They gave me the repair shop's name and I called them directly. The repair shop picked up my tv on October 30th. On November 8th I called the repair shop to see if there had been any progress, and they said they were waiting for the part (the A-Board) to be shipped from Panasonic. On November 16th I called the repair shop again and they said they had no idea when Panasonic would ship the part and recommended I call the Panasonic Viera Concierge service. On November 19th I called the Panasonic Viera Concierge service and spoke with a female named Donet. I asked if Panasonic could tell me when the part would be sent to fix my tv or if they could simply replace my tv before football season was over. Donet said someone would call me back with an answer within three days. Seven days later, after nobody called me back, I called Panasonic again and a different person said somebody would call me back. Not happy with this answer, I eventually spoke to a supervisor named Shamara. Shamara could not explain what happened with Donet or if/when Panasonic would/could repair/replace my tv. Supervisor Shamara said my case would be sent to a different department in 3 to 5 more days.It is now December, I still have no tv, my local football team has been eliminated from the post season and I could have purchased the same tv for half the price on Black Friday.

Also it was delivery to my basement free of charge. You could tell the box had been opened but the TV was in fine shape, just as described by Amazon warehouse website. The delivery company sent email and asked you to pick a time that worked for your schedule for drop off. The delivery guys were right on time and were gone in 15 minutes. I was happy with the whole process.I tried to get my Harmony remote to work with the ST50.  I entered the model number in the setup software, but the system only comes up with the TC-P50ST50 (which is the exact same TV, just a smaller size).  All of the commands work as expected EXCEPT for the IR command for switching the input directly to Cable/Ant.  All of the other input IR commands work (switch to HDMI1, HDMI2, etc).  This was causing me issues with switching inputs. What I did to fix it was put a delay in the Harmony software, it was 1 sec, I changed it to 3 sec. The issue went away. The remote now switches inputs smoothly.There has been much written about the picture quality of the TC-P60ST50 line. All I can say is I could not agree with the reviewers more. The colors pop and the blacks are very inky black. The gray levels are good too. My Old TV was Toshiba 46 inch Table Top RPTV. I bought it in 2004. One of the first things I saw was when I was playing Burn Out Paradise City on the PS3. It was night time, in the game. The best way I can describe it is it looked like late Dusk time frame. Old TV felt like it was midnight, you could not see the cars/poles in your way. You just hoped nothing was in your path. Text is much shaper and readable.I debated the ST50 vs GT50 models. The biggest difference I could see was the calibration settings, THX picture mode. If you want to set up the ST50 picture quickly, use Movie Mode setting. If you want calibrated picture look on Plasmatvbuyingguide.com and CNet.com for the review of the Panasonic TC-P60ST50. In the articles they have the calibrated picture setting they both used. I just averaged the two and I think the picture looks FANASTIC.Now obviously the built in sound is not going to replace your external audio system but I have to say the sound is far better than I expected. Sounds and speech are solid and clear at high and low volume levels and will probably bridge the gap for people not normally happy with built-in speakers but don't want to add on an external system.For those with an external A/V system the TV has ARC, on input #2. My receiver did not have ARC. So I used the optical out from TV. I read, before I bought the TV, that the TV is only passing Dolby digital two channels signals. I am very happy to report that is False. I am getting the full 5.1 audio from TV broadcast and from Netflix. The audio is clean and clear from the optical out.There is a noticeable buzzing sound when displaying large bright white or light scenes and there is no sound. When there is sound from the TV or other ambient sounds I don't notice this buzzing at all.Some people mentioned the amount of heat the ST50 put out. All I can compare it to is our older Panasonic TH-42PX80U. The PX80U gets much warmer. That model is a 42 inch TV. The P60ST50 puts out, I am guessing, about less than half the heat I have felt from the PX80U. I would say the 60 inch TV is much more efficient than the TH-42PX80U. The P60ST50 runs relativity cool considering its size.This is a side note. My receiver has only 2 optical in's. One is for the DVD player and the other is for the TV. To get my Original Xbox working with its HD adapter I had to buy an adapter from MonoPrice, #5971. It takes in Component Video and optical audio and sends out a HDMI signal. It works great and for $40 you can not beat the quality. I was happy to discover the MonoPrice product.Overall I would recommend the ST50 line to anyone who is half-way interested in a new TV.

Some of the well-documented issues persist (ABL, crosstalk in 3D, some noise in dark scenes, etc.) For me, however, it's the audible buzz that is the potential deal breaker. On scenes with even some bright content the buzz can clearly be heard over low-mid volume content from 10 feet away. I understand that plasma technology is somewhat to blame (and the need to make sets as thin as possible these days), but the sound is loud enough to detract from the viewing experience. Perhaps if the tv is wall mounted, this would dampen the noise-- or just duct tape a pillow on the back ;) I'm now on my second set (first was February build, current is April build) and am somewhat reluctant to not return it, as well.Update (7/26/12): Unfortunately, I've experienced the same issue with the 55\" GT50 (which I do prefer to the ST for the additional shades of gray, bezel aesthetics, etc.) I understand that some owners do not experience this problem (or simply do not hear the buzz), but based on additional professional and consumer reviews, many do. This leads me to question Panasonic's quality control. I will likely either have a tech take a look or swap out one last time and will update my review accordingly.Update (8/5/12): As much as I would have liked to continue watching the Olympics on the GT50, I chose to return it. As another reviewer has noted, I believe the buzz is simply within Panasonic's acceptable limits.  i.e - they do not consider this to be a problem, which is unfortunate. In addition, after watching more cable content lately, I would also agree that while the set has arguably one of the best pictures for blu-ray, other sources are quite soft (including the Olympics). May be looking at LED/LCDs now...Update (10/12/12): Hopefully, my search is over... I've now settled on the Sony HX850 (LED/LCD). The picture is nearly as impressive at the Panny plasmas, without the buzz. Of course, no set is perfect.  The Sony has its own drawbacks that I'll address in another review. Fingers are crossed that nothing new pops up, but for now minor light leakage and some 3D ghosting, which I hope can be corrected, are my main concerns. The Sony was originally nearly $1000 more than the Panny, but now is within a few hundred dollars.  I told myself that I'd never buy another Sony, as my previous sets had major quality issues, but I'm hoping that they are making a return to their Trinitron days of reliability and performance.

I didn't purchase mine through Amazon, but I'd still like to share my thoughts since I shop Amazon a lot. This 55\" is currently used in my home theater in a fairly light controlled room (I use 99.9% light block curtains on the only window in the room).THE GOOD.--Price. Its hard to beat the size vs price vs performance this plasma sets. I will never buy another TV under 55\"  for my home theater.--HD Picture Quality. The ST50 does probably deserve the praise it receives. Even when calibrated with a simple disc like DisneyWOW or AVS HD 709 (a free download) in Cinema or the better mode to use Custom, the black level is really incredible and while maintaining a very bright picture for a plasma. Color looks astonishing as well as contrast levels. I'd rather a professional reviewer explain those details but I'm so satisfied with the picture this thing presents when watching my blu-rays it makes me want to rewatch my entire collection, which I'm currently doing. THIS is the reason to buy an HDTV and the most important thing.--No buzz on my ST50. Its dead quiet unless you put your ear BEHIND the tv and listen during an all white picture. I don't suggest watching TV behind the unit. It seems plasma buzz varies unit to unit.--Design I'm very happy with. Last years ST30 was said to be a great bang for buck performer but its design was so lacking I put buying a TV on hold. This year Panasonic really got their act together and made a great design. For a plasma its also thin and similar to a Samsung plasma's thickness.--Fighting Reflections. This TV actually does a really reasonable job at maintaining black level and fighting off reflections compared to my old Sony, and other tv's with glass fronts. It really is worth a mention but don't expect many tv's to fight against a wall of windows (buy some **** sun block curtains! Trust me!). With the lights on and window curtain open its still holds a great picture. Black levels still look great. I suppose thats cause, for a plasma, this TV can get bright.WHATS NOT SO GREAT?--SD content, needless to say, isn't very forgiving. Especially SD cable. Its certainly watchable and DVD's are passable at best, but you're gonna want to replace them with blu-rays and HD cable. As you should put a nail in SD's coffin anyways. There are some tv's made to have SD and internet content look better, but you need to spend more money.--Power Light. A small annoyance is that the little red power light can't be disabled during viewing. If its any value I no longer notice it most of the time. Panasonic: PLEASE fix this in an update!!!--The rainbow effect was something early DLP projectors showed in high contrast scenes. Sad to say I notice this on my ST50 and is a HUGE minus. Its something not everyone will see, granted, but I'm one of those unlucky few. Tron Legacy is the worst offender I've noticed thus far. To note I don't notice it as much anymore (probably taking me a solid 3 weeks). Maybe I learned to relax my eyes... I don't know.--Line Bleed. The worst thing in my book plasma's exhibit is called line bleed. Its something I didn't actually notice until a month later and it was too late to exchange. It. Is. Terrible! Line bleed can be seen on almost any bright green, blue, or red warning screen before a movie. It can be seen slightly in the menu screen of the ps3 in the upper right corner (there's a Info box). It can be seen during movie scenes that show news boxes on screen. It can be seen if horizontal window blinds are in the scene. The line bleed will cut through somebody's face. If there's a horizontal line it will send a ghostly line that continues to the edge of the display. If the line is slightly off axis it goes away. Line bleed is not fun, nor attractive. This is my biggest complaint with this TV.OTHER NOTES--I just don't care or really use \"smart tv\" features. Never got the point but some might like the idea. I guess I was never wowed by the idea of apps on my tv, and thought that money should be used towards eliminating poor uniformity on LED tv's or something. My ST50 did connect wireless very quickly to my network and updated (the current update changed the volume bar to look better I notice). I also setup my Facebook account and YouTube and it works but it does react  s l o w l y... Better to use your laptop thats probably already sitting next to you.--DLNA works but still have some problems streaming MKV's and some files. I use TVersity which works better but you can't beat hooking up your laptop to your TV thru HDMI.--Panasonic doesn't include 3D glasses. Not even cheap ones shockingly. Its a shame but since I bought this for 2D movies I'm not crying about it. Currently I don't own any 3D glasses (but a few 3D blu-rays) to see how it looks but maybe one day soon I will purchase some and update this review.That's my honest review of the ST50. The picture this thing can achieve overall is simply awesome, even given the few gripes I have. Its a great buy and I highly suggest it until the next big technology comes our way into affordable HDTV, such as OLED. If your not into calibrating a TV I highly suggest you at the very least search online, on forums, and websites, and experiment with different picture settings. It usually gives you a good basis to start with. Try searching on CNet. It was a respectable picture although I had to turn the contrast and brightness down a click or two.Go buy this tv if you can't decide.

Dnice is a professional TV calibrator. If you go to highdefjunkies.com and search for P55ST50 you will see the settings thread. Go into that thread and download the slides. You can put the slides on an SD drive or a USB drive and plug them into your TV. On page 3 of that thread are step by step instructions on how to prepare your TV for viewing. During the first 100 hours your TV needs to be broken in properly. You need to run those slides on your TV for the first 100 hours so that the TV can be properly broken in. There are settings for people that are to impatient to run the slides but I would recommend running the slides if you want to get the best possible picture other than hiring a calibrator to calibrate your set. My set didn't actually start giving me the best picture until about 150 hours of play time or maybe it took my eye's that long to adjust to the plasma. This is my first ever plasma TV for my home. I ran the slides on this set like instructed and after the first 100 hours put in the professional settings for my TV. If you are not familiar with plasma's then there are a few things you need to know. When you turn on the TV you can hear a slight buzzing sound if you put your head behind the TV. You shouldn't be able to hear it when you get a foot or two away from the TV. I can't hear it from the front at all and I have to be about 6 inches away from the rear of the panel to hear the buzz. Secondly you may notice some static when viewing the set closer than 2 or 3 feet away. This is called dithering and at first it really bothered me. It seemed to go away after awhile and I don't notice it any more or maybe I'm just not that close to the set anymore since it's calibrated and there is nothing left for me to do but to watch movies, sports and tv shows.If you love watching movies then get this TV. Movies look fantastic on this TV. The colors and blacks are fantastic. Much better than any LED Tv that I have seen. The LCD's are fine and give you a great picture but nothing compares to this for watching Movies.I have 3 windows in my TV viewing room and 2 skylights. None of the windows or skylights shine directly on the TV and I have heavy blinds on all my windows. I have no problem watching tv during the daylight and the picture is still awesome.You can play MP4's over DLNA from you computer. You can hook up a USB drive and play MP4 or MKV files from the TV. The TV will not convert DTS audio so you will have to convert that audio format to AAC or AC3 if you want to play the files on your TV. You can put a 1tb drive into the TV via USB and watch all your videos that way. You can play 3D movies from the USB port or by using DLNA. Search for stereoscopic player for playing 3D files on your PC. I have a PC setup with 1.4a HDMI video card hooked up to my TV and I just watch files that way.When you hook up your PC to this computer the screen is perfect. In my old LED TV the letter to words were always just a little fuzzy and I could never get them perfect. The plasma TV doesn't have that problem. Your desktop will be perfect and the words are 100 percent crisp and clear.I have experienced no burn in or image retention, which is why you should run the slides for 100 hours before using this set full time. I still run the slides after a long PC session just to be safe but so far I have not experienced any problems. I use the PC quite a bit and I have had no problems seeing anything on the TV when I am done. The Smart options on the TV are ok but since I have a few gaming rigs in my home I just prefer to use a real PC to browse the web use facebook and twitter and whatever else I might want to do.I bought a logitech wireless keyboard and mouse to use on the PC I have connected to the TV and I tried hooking it into the TV via the USB connection and it worked perfectly so you should be able to use any wireless keyboard on the TV.Overall this is the best TV I have ever owned. I'm coming from and  50 inch LED Samsung TV and while that picture was very nice it just can't match this TV for Movie watching and black levels.***************************UPDATE*********************************************************************After having this Plasma for a few months now I would not buy it again. It's a beautiful TV and it plays Movies and TV shows brilliantly but if you like watching CNN or ESPN or any channel that keeps the Logo on all the time then DO NOT BUY this TV. The Image Retention is HORRIBLE. I now spend more time running slides to remove the image retention then I do watching TV on this set. I'm just using it for Movies and TV shows right now which is just silly for a TV that costs this much. I watch ESPN a lot and it's taken me 3 weeks to get the Logo to a point where I can't see it when watching the set. I know it's a plasma and I realize that there will be some retention but this is just not worth it to me. This will be my first and last plasma. If you don't watch news channels or sports channels and just watch movies and normal television it is a great TV but for all around use it's not worth the money.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV with no real downsides.", "Author": "Z. S. Benjamin", "ReviewID": "R206GBMO049QNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent several of the last few months researching out a new TV to upgrade to, and finally settled on this 55\" Viera as most reviews, forums, and people seem to agree it's the best bang for your buck for absolutely stellar picture quality.  I also spent much time researching other TV's and debating between LED-LCD vs. Plasma and traditional LCD, before choosing this model.  I can safely say that this TV is the best I have ever owned, offering exemplary picture quality with no real negatives.One of the reasons I had considered an LED TV was that of the light weight and slim, sexy profile found on the higher-end models that's great for wall mounting and aesthetically pleasing.  At the same time, LED TV's concerned me due to the lack of picture quality found in lower-end models, with issues such as edge bleeding and non-uniform lighting a real problem.  Eventually I reached the conclusion that in order to find an LED TV that would satisfy my demands for picture quality, that I would need to find a true led-backlit model which at 55\" will set you back well over $2K.On the other hand, this Viera offers arguably better picture quality than a backlit LED TV due to it's deep black levels, while still having a profile almost as thin as the newest LED TV's.  This 55\" model only weighs aboout 60 lbs wall-mounted, has an incredibly thin bezel, and a depth of about only 1.5 inches on the sides, extending to ~2 inches towards the middle.  It's a far cry from the 135lb 4.5-inch thick 5-year old 58\" Panasonic Viera Plasma that I helped a friend pick out several years ago.  Once calibrated, colors are crisp and vibrant, and the black levels are so dark it's hard to believe that your're looking at a TV.  After disabling some of the useless post-processing features, input-lag for 1080P PC Gaming is literally non-existent.In regards to some of the potential negatives a few fellow reviewers have mentioned, I'd like to say that I have not experienced any of them.  To me there is no audible buzzing when the unit is running, and I sit only about 7-8 feet away from the TV typically.  I've watched 4:3 movies cropped with black bars, played games with permanent logos, and also left static images running on the screen probably longer than I should have, but I haven't experienced any sort of fade or burn-in whatsoever.The only downside I can think of that might turn someone off is that of power consumption, as I measured the unit pulling around 350-400 watts while running using the included sensor on my battery-backup UPS. But honestly, the stellar picture quality is definitely worth it.  I've owned 2 plasma and 2 regular LCD's of various sizes prior to this TV, and none of them come close in terms of the range of color or depth of the black levels.  The only display I have used that is comparable is my PC monitor, a 27\" 1440P Samsung IPS Panel that has a slightly more vibrant range of color but nowhere near the level of uniformity or black levels offered by the Viera.  In short, I don't think you'd be able to find a better quality image anywhere remotely close to this price range for a 55\" TV.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "TV Died After Only 6 Months of Use. Avoid Panasonic at All Costs!!!", "Author": "Brent Madden", "ReviewID": "R1MTRUX2YPHAOP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "OK, here's the story in a nutshell. I bought a P55ST50 55\" plasma TV from Amazon on 4/21. It arrived on 4/28 and everything was fine from that point until 2 weeks ago. On 11/7 I was sitting there just watching a basketball game and suddenly the TV clicked off and the red power light repeatedly started blinking 3 times. It would not turn back on with either the remote or the physical power button on the TV. Called Panasonic's supposedly exclusive Concierge service which is a joke, but more on that in a minute. They told me it would take a week to get someone out to look at it. Now the insert I received with the TV said if you buy a Viera TV you're entitled to priority in-home service usually within 2 days. Well, it took a week to get someone here to look at it and when he finally arrived he discovered that the A-board(the main board that controls the TV) had died. He said a part had to be ordered from Panasonic and gave me no timeframe for when the TV would be repaired. It has now been 2 weeks since the TV died and I have not received an update from Panasonic with regards to when the part will be shipped or when someone will come to install it. All they could tell me was that it was being \"expedited\". So, the Concierge service not only hasn't given me priority in-home service, but they also haven't provided a complimentary loaner TV in place of the broken one which is another thing they promised in their literature. Basically, everything that Panasonic promises to an owner of a Viera TV is a complete lie and I am now looking into my options as far as contacting the BBB or some sort of consumer fraud agency so they can look into this matter. This is the 3rd Panasonic plasma TV I have purchased and I can promise it will be the LAST Panasonic product I ever buy.

Cramer", "ReviewID": "R3V133Z30JPOYL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, it looks like Panasonic has really nailed their plasmas for 2012.  After seeing the glowing reviews and checking it out in store, I recommended the ST50 to a family member and they purchased the 55\" model the next day.  After seeing and calibrating this set, I have great hopes that the VT50 will finally equal the Kuro Elites from 4 years ago.  I agree with other reviews that this set is just as good as the flagship VT30 from 2011 and I can also say it matches or even exceeds my Kuro 5020 from 2008.Styling---------First off, the styling of the Pannys this year has greatly improved.  Except for the flagship, they had always had kind of a `homely' design but that has changed.  For the ST50, they have added transparent plastic around the angled black bezel that slightly resembles Samsung plasmas from years past.  The set is nice and thin at 1.8\" and has a very modern looking silver stand.  Overall I really like the appearance even though I'll bet it will not be quite as slick as some competitors.  The remote has also been improved a bit and I like it.  It is backlit and the buttons feel good while being nicely sized, but for some reason not all the buttons are lit.  That is a drawback but really, very people actually use the TV remote for anything other than settings.Features----------One big improvement was the screen filter.  This set is in a room that has quite a bit of daylight and the ST50 preserved blacks quite nicely with just a little washout and subdued reflections nicely, even when at extreme angles.  It also handles night reflections from lights very well for a plasma.  Apparently this set has a `louvre-type' filter that helps block reflections from above, and it is quite effective.As with Panasonic plasmas from years past, this model lacks the 96 Hz refresh rate to properly handle 1080p/24, but for the vast majority of users this is no problem.  This set still handles movies very well and I did not see any artifacts.  If you don't know what I'm talking about here, you will not miss this feature.  Blu-rays are absolutely gorgeous on this set and upscaled dvd's are not far behind.The ST50 has active 3D, but does not come with glasses.  However, it does support the new universal standard which means more glasses should work this set.  One pair of glasses was purchased so I briefly tested out the 3D with Bolt.  I'm not too fond of 3D, but the quality was very good and there was minimal crosstalk.  I haven't watched too much 3D, but this set was really no worse or better than any others I've seen and perhaps it was just my lack of active 3D experience, but this one didn't seem to darken the image as much as others.The VieraCast `Smart TV' remains highly unchanged from last year.  Overall it's easy to use and you can adjust items' locations, but occasionally it can be a bit slow to navigate.  Not a big deal, but something to be aware of.  The selection is good with the usual ones:  Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Vudu, YouTube, Skype, Facebook and many others.  Besides the typical ones, there are many more available in the Market where you can browse while still seeing what you were watching.  I believe there is a web browser also, but I haven't tried that yet.  I will update the review once I get to checking that out.This set has 3 HDMI inputs which should be fine, but if for some reason you have more than 4 HDMI devices and don't use a receiver it's something you should be aware of.  The GT50 adds a 4th input.  It also uses breakout cables for composite and component input due to the thinness of the set, and has 2 usb ports and a SD card slot which has always been a nice feature on the Panasonics.Picture Quality-----------------The picture setting options remain like they have in the past.  You get the basic settings with Cinema having the most accurate default settings and all the other worthless ones (no THX on the ST50).  One thing to note is that there is a motion smoother setting set to on by default.  I would recommend turning this and other worthless options like black extension off for the best quality, as when on they can cause some funkiness.  The Custom option offers a few more `Pro settings' with some gamma presets and a 2-point grayscale control.  Using this and the Cnet settings as a starting point, I was able to tweak the set to an excellent picture.The quality of the ST50's picture for a mid-range set is great.  The black levels are very good and on par with my Kuro 5020 from 2008.  The letterbox bars, while still visible on dark scenes will blend into the bezel on bright scenes.  The Elites: the 08 Kuro and last year's Sharp, will still best the blacks on this set, but not my much.  That gap has shrunk significantly with these 2012 Panasonics.  The shadow detail was excellent on this set as I did not witness any black crush within the dark scenes.  There are some night scenes in Band of Brothers I use to test shadow detail and contrast and the ST50 performed great.Panasonic also finally eliminated that green push that has tainted their non-flagship models for the past few years.  Using the HD Essentials BR and the redhead scene, she looked incredibly natural with no reddish hue.  For not having a CMS, I was very impressed with the color accuracy of the ST50.  Nature scenes appear natural and flesh tones are almost spot on - not perfect but darn close.As with all plasmas, the viewing angle on the ST50 is superb.  You can literally be looking at this screen from the side and still see the picture as bright and natural as being straight on.  This is still the one area where LCD's aren't even close to being on the same playing field as plasmas.Other Thoughts----------------The set does run warm, but not quite as bad as years passed.  Even though they will never match LCDs, they keep on improving the energy efficiency of these plasmas.  As far as buzzing, this has the one of the lowest buzz levels of plasmas I've heard.  Usually in dead silence you can hear the buzz quite clearly, but on the ST50 you can only hear it if you're looking for it.Everything thrown at this set has looked great.  Several Blu-rays, quality HD programming on Smithsonian and HDNET, PS3 games and upscaled dvds.  Of course even though most cable/satellite channels are very poor quality, the `flaws' on these channels didn't seem as pronounced on this set and actually looked halfways decent.As with all flat screens, the audio quality is nothing to write home about but I would say the quality on this one is better than most.  If you just want to just hear the audio, the built-in speakers will suffice as the volume can go quite loud and the dialogue is clear.  Obviously for the best experience, a separate sound system will be best.Value and Overall Thoughts---------------------------I think the ST50 is a superb value.  Even at the retail price it is a good value and this will only keep improving as prices drop.  I can't say how it compares to the GT50, but I'm guessing there won't be too much difference between these set's PQ, if any at all yet the GT50 runs several hundred more.  It will probably lag behind the flagship VT50, but will also be about half the price of that set.As I and the owners use this set more, I will report back with any more issues that may come up or further feedback on the set.  With all that, I can say with confidence that this may be the best performance-to-value set of 2012.  There is very little not to like with this set and overall, it is a superb display for anyone but the pickiest of videophiles.  I highly recommend the ST50.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent value, excellent picture, stupid plastic trim", "Author": "emptyminded42", "ReviewID": "R3SUKUM5I4FGJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about 4 months now (bought from BestBuy) so I figure it's time to write a review. I use this TV in a large, white living room with 20ft windows - it's a really bright room. I was afraid of not being able to see the picture but brightness is a non-issue. Picture is absolutely crystal clear, amazing contrast, and excellent color right out of the box. I haven't felt the need to adjust them as I'm not a videophile but I'm observant enough to know that contrast and black levels are very important to me.A few issues:-buzz from screen, but only audible if the TV is muted and I'm listening for it. A non-issue if you're someone who doesn't watch golf, muted news, or whatever. My couch is only 8-10 ft away and I'm sure you wouldn't be able to hear it past 15 ft away.-brightness was unacceptably low until I discovered \"Game Mode\". Turn this on if you have a bright room - makes the colors pop and doubled the brightness (to me at least)-the clear plastic trim around the outside is going to look... dated in a couple years but it's not a deal-breaker-color when watching 2D -> 3D conversion is washed out and low contrast. Probably due to the fact it's a conversion but disappointing. No 3D football for me. 3D Blu-ray on the other hand? Amazing.Overall, I'm extremely happy with the TV. I wish it didn't have the plastic trim. Blacks are black, contrast is amazing, sports look great, and movies even better (especially at night). No brightness/backlight banding like on my friend's LG LED TV. Turn the \"game mode\" on if the screen is too dim and turn off \"power save\".If you're looking for a first HDTV (as I was) or want to upgrade, this is a great value IMO - excellent color right out of the box, easy to assemble (especially with another person), and makes movies and sports look great. All the scare about plasmas being horrible in bright rooms is rubbish - just make sure you don't have reflections from windows/lamps and you're fine. This TV is in the brightest living room I've ever seen and its picture is excellent.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "W-O-W !!!", "Author": "tarheelbill", "ReviewID": "R6KQF8HGMHT9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great TV! Black is Black. It's deep with great contrast. The picture just POPS! I was directed to this TV by simply googling \"Best HD TV Picture\". Hit the first site listed, in this case, CNET. This one, at < $1600 was the 2nd TV listed behind another plasma @ almost 5 grand! I recommend you google the same thing, read (or listen to) the CNET reviews, and believe everything you hear (not a recommendation I make or take lightly). Set up was easy (replacing a 40\" wall mount, so everything was in place to hang it right up), used the recommended picture settings on CNET, put my feet up and let myself be amazed. I am not into 3D, so that was not a consideration when researching. And this TV DOES NOT include glasses (somebody should let Panasonic know that this is a marketing OUCH for 3 D-ophiles!). So for now, I can't comment on the 3D performance of this TV. But everything else is great. I have it in our family room, which is a less-than-brightly-lit room. It's my first plasma, but I'm told they do have glare issues in naturally brightly-lit rooms. No glare issues here. Linked up to my home network easily. Easy access to preloaded links. I must say the remote is pretty basic. Not really a programmable universal type remote. Works well with the TV, but as far as I can tell, that's all it works with. I use a Logitech Harmony remote, so that too is a non-issue for me. I just programmed the TV into the Harmony (HINT - Run an update on your Harmony remote BEFORE programming your Viera).Getting it was super easy! Best Buy, who has been whining a lot lately about folks using their stores as a showroom to make hands-on assessments, then buying from Amazon, would not touch the deal I got from Amazon. So I ordered, selected the free shipping, selected a date & time (yes, that option was available with FREE shipping) and got my TV PDQ! Specifically, Ordered on Monday, could have gotten it delivered to my door on Wednesday but selected a delivery time of 8 to 11 am Saturday, got a call from the delivery service at 7:45 am Saturday, and they had it out of the box and on the floor by 8:30 am. The delivery service will set it up on the stand, hook it up, and set it up for you, but won't wall mount it. That was okay by me, cuz setting the thing up is half the fun!! And because this 55\" TV is so thin, it was only about 10 lbs. heavier than the 40\" I replaced. So there were no issues using my existing mount. RECOMMENDATION: Keep the box and packing on the small chance there may be an issue and you'd need to return. I had none of those issues, and have since tossed the box, but give it a week or two.Over a month, and I'm still loving it! Almost everyday, I will tweak a little here, tweak a little there, just playing around with the picture, not because I need to but because I can, and it's fun! No visitors walk through the family room without commenting first on the size and the appearance of the TV, then about the great picture. I can't wait for my NFL Sunday Ticket subscription to crank back up. I'll never see the light of day on a fall Sunday again! This is gonna be like being on the 50 yard line!As you can tell, I like this TV. Great pic, sleek design. I'm not as easy to please as I sound in this review, but I just can't say it enough.

After all of my research, the Panasonic ST50 is 1,000 bucks cheaper, with the image quality just a little below the VT series. Even CNET says the ST50 series and the upgrade GT50 series share the EXACT same screen. The picture is identical. The GT is more sylish in design, and has an extra processor. THX is also available on the GT. I think THX is overrated and incredibly dim to watch. I don't need the extra processor for Blueray and WiFi Netflix viewing so this TV was perfect for me. You can get the 55\" ST CHEAPER than a 50\" GT, with the same picture. I really don't know why people even consider and LCD or LED tv compared to the picture quality of this plasma. It doesn't get any better! In fact, one trusted review site said the picture quality on this year's ST series clearly beats last year's top-tier VT series.

First of all, it was at the top of the charts and selected a Best Buy in the December, 2012 issue of Consumer Reports - a Best Buy because it was half the price of next highest rating, the Sony Bravia XBR-55HX929, selling for $3000.00.  The Panasonic is $1200.00 on Amazon. Also important, it's rated #1 in reliability, with the lowest repair rate among plasma T.V's.Second, the respected CNET reviews also gives the ST50 a 9.7 or Outstanding rating and states that \"it sets a lofty standard for HDTV picture quality this year, and one I feel confident only a few TVs will approach. I doubt any of them will do it for less money.\"  It rates a 10 in value to earn CNET's \"best bang for the buck\" award and its 2012 Editors' Choice in the plasma TV category.

The Viera turned out to be true to its sterling reviews.  The picture is amazing and the controls and menus are clear and simple.  No buzzing from my experience and the sound is fine, although I've just purchased the Yamaha Digital Home Theatre RX-V373 (rated #1 by Consumer Reports).

When it comes to a Plasma TV of this quality and price range, there is NO beating Panasonic.  I purchased my first Panasonic plasma in 2007, a 42\" 720p with 1080i capability and have been thrilled with it to this day with absolutely NO issues with the set, so after seven years, I finally decided to upgrade and started looking around.I went back to Panasonic to shop recently but was surprised to see the new \"Price Protection\" that most of the manufacturers have in place making negotiations and sale prices (of much interest) a thing of the past.  So I bought a Samsung PN51E550 (51\") for a second home for around $800.  What a mistake.  I'm a Creative Director in graphics and picky on color reproduction. The picture on the Samsung was absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to adjust.  Skin tones too red, whites not bright, blacks flat.  The worst thing was the sound and the dead \"thump\" and rattle at most volume levels.  Horrible - so back it went.I'd given up on my upgrade until I found this model and PRICE on Amazon - my best shopping spot as always. This set is on sale often for maybe a couple hundred dollars off at the big box stores, but Amazon can best the big box store's best price if you check back often.  This set is everything you need and MORE.  AMAZING color reproduction right out of the box, built in WiFi/Ethernet so I did not need to upgrade my Panasonic Blu-Ray with a streaming option (for Netflix, etc.) and gave me a spare streaming media player using my former (Sony SMP-200 from Amazon) elsewhere since this set has that feature built in.  The media playing feature is INCREDIBLE and the interface better than Sony, Roku, or AppleTV.  You can even organize the items as you wish on the screen.  Setup with Netflix and my AMAZON PRIME video account for streaming was very easy. I found in my research that you should not adjust the color/brightness settings for 100 hours of break-in with the \"Pro\" functions, but just the built-in settings are WAY better than anything I could ever achieve on the Samsung that was returned. I was \"told\" from a big box Panasonic representative that the technology of this set's screen is from the 2011 GT/VT high end TVs, but I can't confirm it.  It's amazing I'll tell you that.My original Panasonic 42\" was moved to the master bedroom and since it was always hooked up to an AV audio system, I had forgotten how amazing the built-in speakers are in Panasonic products.  This 55\" Panasonic is even better.  Not only are the speakers and sound reproduction amazing, it has a built-in rear-facing \"subwoofer\" to give it that extra kick.  I've had a (junk) Bose speaker system for many years and their subwoofers do NOTHING.  I recently faced the Bose subwoofer toward the corner of the wall and what do you know - BASS!  Panasonic has already figured this out and placed their \"subwoofer\" accordingly on the back of the set.  There is an adjustment for how far away from the wall the set is to adjust the sound reverb as well.  The 3D is 3D and admirable at 2D to 3D conversion.  The glasses for this set (as an option not included) are $79 at the big box stores and guess what - I got them for $50/pair on (surprise) AMAZON.  The thin clear rim of the TV reads as aluminum in some light and is an extra attraction. The base mount is stunning in a sleek aluminum look design unlike the black plastic box look of most sets.  The remote is admirable, nothing special but has the key functions available and at-hand.  There is a cool Viera App on iTunes for us iPhone iPad folks that gives you all the function of the remote and more on your mobile device and works GREAT. Another great option of the mobile App from Panasonic is it has a function where you can enter in the passwords in a \"texting\" mode not having to deal with the remote (annoying)I was able to stream the movies already on my Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Home 2 TB STAM2000100 (from AMAZON of course) right away with no problems from this set.  Another feature I'd like to note is that this set is half the depth of my 2007 at a very sleek 1.5-2\" and puts off WAY less heat.  My 2007 is rated at 450 watts operating power, this model under 100 and the power usage sticker says the annual usage cost is around $25-30 a YEAR.  If I've not convinced you to hit \"Add to Cart\" by now there's nothing else I can do.  This Panasonic is the BEST quality, cost, reliability and performance of any set around.UPDATE:Well it's been about four months now and the Plasma is as fine as ever!* I've come to find out that the 3D (and glasses I bought) are pretty useless, and fun for an hour or so.  No problem for Panasonic, just not practical.  You also have to hang them off the left side of the set to charge because there is no stand-alone changer.  Someone smarter who might want to void their warranty could find a work-around.* I've yet to customize the color et.al. like on my older Panasonic Plasma.  Let me rephrase, the older one is set to \"Vivid\", this one to \"Normal\".  With the Samsung's I took back I could NEVER get good color - or sound.* The VERY ANNOYING thing about this \"Smart TV\" is you can't set the aspect ratio when using NetFlix, or Amazon and I can only presume the rest.  It's back to letterbox, or hook up my SMP-N200 or 100 - neither available now from Sony.  If you can pick up a Sony SMP-N200 for $50 on Amazon DO IT!  They are amazing and get ... well Amazon Prime streaming and Apple TV DOES NOT!*Viera Cast:  I've only used it for NetFlix and Amazon and DNLA - which works great!

YES, all the software has been updated and is current.FINAL CALL:I would by this set again, and again and again!!!  The quality exceptional the picture unsurpassed! I get a special \"Employee Purchase Program\" price through my employer for this set, so I only paid $1,075.00 to get it to my door WITH tax and (amazing) delivery from Panasonic.  So the above \"Updates\" have no importance because I paid $700-800 less than retail and I didn't need those options anyway - just the ethernet connect.BUY IT, you won't be sorry.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "HUGE BURN-IN (IMAGE RETENTION) RISK", "Author": "M. Trader", "ReviewID": "RWIKP9HVVEJ6U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would strongly advise NOT to purchase this HDTV, or probably any Panasonic plasma for that matter.  I bought it because it was highly rated on Consumer Reports.  I did everything you are supposed to do with a Plasma - broke it in initially by running the slides, never kept the screen paused for an excessive amount of time, etc.After owning the HDTV for about 6 months, I was working from home one day with MSNBC on in the background.  It was probably on that channel for about 5 hours.  Since then, the entire MSNBC logo bar has been burned in to the screen.  I ran the break-in slides again for a full day and also tried running the anti-image retention \"scrolling bars\" consistently.  I also have not watched MSNBC since this happened (2 months).  I called Panasonic about a month ago and they told me to run the scrolling bars every day as much as possible and to avoid the MSNBC channel and the image should eventually go away.  I've followed these instructions and, while the image has faded somewhat, a month later it is still clearly visible.Needless to say, I am absolutely irate about this, especially considering the price of this set.  The image is clearly visible whenever there is a lighter background on the screen.  And, of course image retention is not covered under the Panasonic or separate warranty that I purchased.What a joke.  Next time I will consider an LCD set instead, as I believe the risk of image retention is far less than with a plasma.UPDATE 6/6/2013Just talked to Richard, a supervisor at Panasonic \"Customer Service\".  His advice, either: a) run the scrolling bars in their entirety, 3 times a day for 3 weeks; or b) put a white background on my PC, connect it to the set and let it run for 15 mins, 3 times a day for 3 weeks.  Either of these (or both?) will apparently fix the image retention.  Uh, yeah, right.I asked him, \"I realize that this is not covered under your warranty but let's think about this from a business perspective.  This set cannot cost Panasonic more than $600 to produce (probably less).  I have the power of the Internet and the ability to leave many, many reviews like this (thanks, Amazon!).  Surely this or other reviews will cause at least some people to think twice about this HDTV, and perhaps even Panasonic in general, and, in turn, purchase something else.  And, most likely, this influence will end up costing Panasonic much more than $600 in lost business.  Not to mention the fact that they could spend the time doing what he recommended to fix their own problem on my set and sell it as a refurbished item!  So, why not just replace it?\"His reply, \"it's not covered under warranty so we won't replace it.\"And, there you have it.  Issues like this are probably why Panasonic is reportedly getting out of the TV production business and possibly abandoning Plasma altogether (http://gizmodo.com/5991028/panasonic-to-cut-tv-production-maybe-abandon-plasma).

I spent almost a year comparing and researching different tvs; and could not be happier that I decided to come back to this tv.  One of my big worries about getting any plasma not only this one was image retention with gaming.  Most of the reviews I found or research I did would say that burn-in is a thing of the past and even if you did get some image retention it will go away quickly with normal tv viewing.  The problem is that it did not seem to me that any of the research/reviews were from gamers (people that play games and even the same game fps included for hours at a time).  Also let me say that I look into all the different people that talk about breaking the tv in and stuff and not to play games during that period.  Well the true test is done and I am still so amazed I watched about 10-12 hours worth of full screen blu rays and streaming netflix content before gaming on it for the first time.  I started my session at 1030pm with fifa 13 for about an hour and a half, I then popped in halo 4 and played it for several hours.  By the time I was done gaming it was 330am and I decided to investigate for any type of image retention.  I am happy to report I did not see even a little glint of anything and I still cannot get over how much better everything looks on this tv.

For the amount that I wanted to spend, this screen seemed to fit the bill.Pros:- Stunning picture quality.  I've actually never seen a screen with a more beautiful image.- Dark scenes as good as they come- Absolutely flawless distribution of light across the screen.- Sound is superb.  This is a common weakness of a lot of flat screens and was one of my biggest concerns in buying one. You'll not find a speaker bar necessary here.  Great sound clarity at high volumes and strong bass.Cons:- With bright scenes and low audio volumes, the unit emits a low pitch hum (I'm told from the warm burning phosphors--white being hottest).  I had read about this before I bought and when I first heard it...I chuckled that this would even be considered a problem.  It's hardly noticeable even when it does occur and how often am I watching largely white screens with no audio?  Never.- An advertisement bar comes up at the bottom of the screen when the TV is first turned on.  (I'm told this can be removed but it doesn't bother me enough to even think about trying)My ultimate desire was to have a set with a beautiful display and solid sound.

Coop", "ReviewID": "R28008UL0D2KPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After my old CRT TV died, I decided it was time to make the jump to a flat screen.  Knowing I would likely have this television for an extended amount of time I heavily researched all my options.I started with Consumer Reports to get their objective opinions, then moved to Amazon reviews and Cnet articles.  Triangulating these three sources led me to the Panasonic Viera TC line, and in particular the ST50.  I shopped around at local stores (Best Buy, etc..) to see the TVs up close and personal as well as to compare to other options (mostly the comparable Samsung offering).I found that the Panasonic offered a better quality picture when compared to the Samsung when I compared them side by side. I did give points to Samsung for including 3D glasses (Panasonic you have to buy separately).Now that I have it installed I can attest to the excellent picture quality.  I've not hooked it up to my home speaker system yet, so can also note that the baked in speakers are not bad.The glossy screen has an anti-glare coating, but if it's in a room with windows facing it, you will likely stil have some glare during the day. I didn't have this kind of setup in my living room. My house has windows perpendicular to the TV, and I've had no glare issues.The Viera baked in apps are very nice and intuitive. I opted to save ~$300 and go for the ST50 vs. the GT50, so the baked in browser does not support flash. I did this as I planned to plug the TV into my home PC anyways, so did not need this native to the TV. Other, than flash, though, it surfs the web just fine.2 things I would highly recommend if you buy this:1. Opt for the \"choose the time\" delivery if you have that option.  I was able to pick a 3 hr window for delivery, and Amazon hit it.  The delivery guy brought the unit in my house and offered to uncrate and install it if I needed.  Now THAT's service!2. If you are wall mounting your unit, go for a cheeta mount (Cheetah Mounts Plasma LCD Flat Screen TV Articulating Full Motion Dual Arm Wall Mount Bracket For 32-65\" Displays Up To 165LBS Black With 10' High Speed HDMI Cable With Ethernet Fits Up To 24\" Studs)  I got the one linked here which was 3X cheaper than equivalent mounts I found around town (and better built!)", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great TV", "Author": "J. A. Dent", "ReviewID": "R3B62GCGZTK2T6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using a 40 Inch Sharp LCD for the last three years, it was time to upgrade to a big boy.  After reading a lot of reviews, I picked the Panasonic TC-P55ST50 plasma.Image quality: The image coming off this screen is phenomenal.  The depth of color and contrast is very impressive, bringing HD television to life in a new way (and also inadvertently revealing some bad compression artifacting on some channels).  When switched to Cinema mode and playing back a high quality Blu-Ray like \"Blade Runner\", the level of fine detail and color is pretty incredible.  The image never bloomed out or became over saturated, even with the intense fireballs and alien laser bolts in \"Independence Day\" (a film that caused massive blooming and clipping on my old LCD).  I haven't done any fancy calibration yet, as the TV is still in its initial 100 hour 'break in period', but it's hard to imagine the image needing much improvement.  One negative is that this TV only has 60Hz and 48Hz refresh rates.  While the 60Hz looks fine, the 48Hz mode would be ideal for movie viewing, as it disables the processing needed to turn 24fps into 30fps.  Unfortunately, this makes the image flicker in a noticeable way, and is very distracting.3D quality: When running with a good 3D disc (like \"Hubble 3D\") the sense of depth is very nice, with stars and nebula coming off the screen in several scenes and the background stretching off into near infinite distance in others.  The TV automatically boosts the brightness levels in 3D mode so the image isn't too dark.  The 2012 glasses have good battery life and are fairly comfortable if a bit awkward, however I wear normal glases as well so my opinion is probably skewed.  The glasses can also be plugged into the TV's USB port for charging, which is convenient.  Unfortunately, as with most TV's that use active shutter glasses, ghosting and crosstalk do happen, but outside of \"My Bloody Valentine\" it was never so bad as to be a distraction.  Even \"Hugo\", a disc that several reviewers have claimed has bad crosstalk problems, looked fine for the most part.  Also, the TV's boost of luminance in 3D mode has the side effect of making the black levels a bit too bright for my taste.Sound: the TV has some built in speakers that sound perfectly fine for what they are.  I use a home theater system when watching movies so I don't know how the speakers would handle highly dynamic sound, but for television viewing they are adequate.I normally wouldn't mention shipping methods in a product review, but my experience with getting this TV finally delivered warrant a mention.  First off, Amazon ships these items through a company called Pilot Freight.  A quick look around on the internet will raise a lot of red flags about this company.  It's important to understand that Pilot does not actually deliver anything to your home, rather they get it to the closest major metropolitan area and pass it off to a local delivery company.  This makes Amazon's estimated arrival date completely useless and misleading (and something that should probably be removed).  It goes without saying that due to this multiple handoff method no effort is made to adhere to that arrival date either.  I live pretty far outside of a major city, so that slowed things down even more, as the local delivery company only picks up from Pilot once a week and then waits until the following week to load up a truck that delivers throughout a three state area (giving a very wide window for delivery).  Pilot is also notorious for bad tracking information on their website (incorrect delivery windows and confusing status updates) and a staff of less than helpful people.  Thankfully, the local delivery service (Ryder Logistics) was significantly better, and very helpful and responsive, once I finally got a hold of them......  I breathed a sigh of relief when the TV finally showed up without a scratch.  Plus, I didn't have a solid delivery window until the day before, and even then the guy showed up a couple of hours early.  I doubt everybody has a job where they can just up and leave at the drop of a hat.So to summarize this is a very nice TV for a *relatively* low price.  The image quality is very impressive and the 3D (while prone to some ghosting) is well implemented.  This sucker is heavy but has an elegant look when mounted on either a wall or the included pedestal.  The remote is pedestrian, but everything is accesible and it works fine enough.Overall I can't recommend this TV enough, but be warned about Amazon's choice of delivery service.  While my experience was more frustrating than outright bad, I've heard a lot of horror stories of damaged TV's.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still Suffers From Image Retention", "Author": "Ryan Rembaum", "ReviewID": "R12DRFVB9URHTX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV and did everything they recommended to avoid image retention.

Previous to this purchase i had bought a TV 14 years ago. Needless to say a lot has changed over the years and all the options today in terms of technologies LCD, LED, Plasma, the brands and to top it all the smart features can get pretty confusing.Here's the criteria I was using for TV Selection** Must Haves55inch plusExcellent Picture Quality3-4 HDMI connectionsBuilt-in WifiSupport for basic streaming apps : Youtube, Amazon, Hulu , NetFlixNot extremely heavy to move around (approx 40-45 pounds)Doesn't burn a hole in my wallet (be in the $1100- $1200 range)** PreferencesLED over PlasmaThis TV easily met all of the criteria with some added bonuses i.e 3D support and easy viewing of photos and videos using a media card and USB flash drives so does the it's sibling the Edge-lit Panasonic VIERA TC-L55ET5 55-Inch 1080pRead-on if you want to get more of how I settled on this TV instead of its sibling and some of the other choices.Reviews on various sites including Amazon indicated Panasonic and Samsung TVs have been reliable , offer good picture quality and most if not all of the features I had in my selection criteria including the price range. Samsung a little further out of the budget range but given I don't plan on buying TVs very often I could stretch budget a little bit. You will find certainly run into negative reviews as well as with any product. In fact those help you keep an eye on what to look for when you get a TV. I needed the extra help having not had any experience buying a flat screen TV.For example with my preference for LED as newer technology I went with the Edge-lit Panasonic VIERA TC-L55ET5 55-Inch 1080p. The fact that it was CNET recommended made it easy as well. The L55ET5 is pretty much the same except for the LED technology aspect. Now to how the reviews helped. Some of the reviews for Panasonic and other LED TVs indicated that some TVs have a \"light bleed\" or \"clouding\" issue. It could be a streak or a blob or a cloud like white light around the edges/corners. This is due to light from the LEDs leaking out in the picture area. The specific TV I had unfortunately had the issue. I could see it easily transitioning between channels typically at night when the room is dark in a couple of spots. Unclear of the long term impact of this issue on reliability and picture quality and more importantly because I don't plan on buying a TV anytime soon I decided to switch.However having now seen a Panasonic HD TV in action and delivering on all the features most importantly on the picture quality I kept it simple and switched to its Plasma sibling. Clearly this TV has delivered on the promise as well. All the same features, not mention even darker blacks as you can expect for all plasmas.  I've had it for about 45 days and still very pleased with it.One last thing regardless of what you pick if you are like me switching from a Standard definition TV you wont go wrong picking either one of these Panasonic TVs.Happy Hunting!BIG THANK YOU TO AMAZONFor first and foremost price matching the initial purchase on the L55ET5 and also delivering on the white glove delivery and replacement commitment.

I had researched for a good gaming/movie hdtv for about a year. Every forum I joined recommended this tv. However this being my first plasma tv I was so concerned about burn in and image retention. I finally bit the bullet and got the 55 inch from best buy and had them price match pauls tv,  I got there protection service plan as well. I have only had this tv for a little over a week but I must say it is fantastic in every way. Its bigger than I expected and is incredibly thin. I told myself I was not going to game or watch anything for the first 100 hours and just run \"break\" in slides. I tried but it didn't happen, as soon as I unboxed it I put the SD card in and  I watched the slides for about 10 minutes and thought it was too long. I watched TIN TIN first and I zoomed in the picture just to get rid of black bars as well as kept the movie settings to standard. The movie looked great right out of the box my gf said its like looking through a window the image is so crisp and clear. I would run the sides when not watching a movie and when im not home.  Here is some of the concerns I might be able to clear upThe buzzing: Has not been an issue, you can hear a faint humming on bright white screens but can only be heard if ur real close to the tv and theres no sound any where.Image retention and or burn in : This was my biggest concern and fear because I bought this tv mainly for gaming!  I made sure to zoom in on almost anything I watched with black bars for the first 100-120 hours or so. I have gamed on this set a few times since my purchase however I cant play a game for more than a couple hours at a time due to the fact i want to see how all of my games look and what I have been missing haha. I will definitely  keep this updated and let you know if i have any problems with this.  Input lag is fantastic and is very responsive.Picture quality: What more can a say other than that its the BEST IVE EVER SEEN. I havent changed the settings yet and the picture is immaculate, I will mess around with them soon and probably share what i come up with. I havent tried any 3d with this set yet but i will be getting the glasses soon and report back with my experience.DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS TV", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Advertisements on my volume control?!", "Author": "J.

In setting up the TV, I broke the part for the digital optical audio out, with very little force.  It had connected easily, but when I shifted the TV to its final position, I heard the snap and found the thin plastic pieces behind the TV.  Fortunately, the speakers built in to the TV are actually not bad.  This was my error, but it would appear easy to make -- be sure that the wires are all very loose when positioning/moving the TV.  The connection to the Wi-Fi was NOT easy.  Out of the box, it actually found my network, but could not connect to it.  With repeated efforts, it could not even find the network, and the wireless N router is 5 feet away.  Fortunately, I have a six foot ethernet cord in the house and made a wired connection.  Then, I was able to update the television's firmware and try again.  Once the television was updated, I was able to make the wireless connection and have had no trouble since.

After the service company left, I noticed a VERY visible red line that ran top to bottom of the television that was obviously a flaw/defect.

So earlier in 2012 I began doing research on TV's to see what was getting good reviews and to follow the price. The review in the ST50 was very high so I kept this along with a couple Samsung models on my radar with the intention of buying when the price dropped.Finally right around Black Friday I started seeing the price come down and grabbed one from Amazon.The TV is as great as the reviews describe. The picture is amazing. After about 100 hours of aging the TV I calibrated it to the recommended settings and have never looked back. Friends have come over to watch movies and have commented on how awesome the picture is. Very happy with it and feel I got my money's worth. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a HDTV.Below is the link to the review from CNET if interested.[...]I also wanted to comment on the delivery company (CEVA) since if you order this TV from Amazon you will likely have it delivered to you from the same company.The first TV that was delivered was damaged so I had to refuse delivery. (Make sure you un-package before you sign for delivery). I got on the phone with Amazon the same day and they ordered a new one to be sent. Amazon was very easy to deal with in regards to getting a new one sent. (5 Star for Amazon).The delivery company gives you a delivery window of 9AM-3PM, which I think is a bit unreasonable. Since the first one was damaged that meant that I had to set aside another full day to wait around for the TV. Unfortunately, the day I scheduled for the second TV to be delivered they never showed up. I got a call the next morning at 9AM from the delivery company apologizing for missing the delivery. They said they would send a man out with my TV that same day..between the hours of 9-3....Unbelievable.At this point I just wanted my TV, so I agreed. When the TV Finally came it was in the back of a station wagon (not a delivery truck). Luckily this one was not broken so I signed and sent them off.I'm sure that this sort of think doesn't happen often but I felt it was worth mentioning in the review.I kept the star rating strictly for the TV.While the process of getting the TV was frustrating, I did finally get what I ordered and am very happy with it.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Thrilled with the quality of the picture!", "Author": "Mark D.

I say \"flaws\" because both the Samsung and the Panasonic were supposed to have all kinds of \"minor cosmetic damage\" and I never could find the issues and the Panasonic runs beautifully.

Bradley", "ReviewID": "R38IUP9U4F6QQ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always steered clear of the Plasma TVs due to the many issues I had always heard about: don't last as long, more energy to run, image retention issues, not bright enough, whites not white, etc.  But this summer I wanted to buy a new 55\" TV and I was unimpressed with the various LED options out there.  Despite that, I bought a Panasonic 55\" 3D LED TV and brought it home for a week.  Suffice it to say, I brought it back due to many issues and replaced it with this Panasonic Plasma.  I brought it home, made the recommended AVS Forum adjustments, and started watching.  Holy Cow!  What a stunning picture.  Coming from the LED, it is truly night and day.  I am not much of a videophile, but this is perhaps one of the most stunning, beautiful displays I have had the pleasure of watching!  For that, alone, I am incredibly happy with my purchase.In addition, the many issues I mentioned are really not issues, anymore.  They now last as long as LED or LCD TVs (or near enough as to not make a difference), they don't use all that much more energy than LCD/LED these days, image retention issues have been improved a lot over the years, and brightness has improved a lot as well (this is all from what I have read or been told).A few other points:- Image Retention: I have kids who watch the TV.  Despite my many warnings about not leaving static images up, one of my kids turned on pandora on the receiver (which does not have a screen saver) and left the tv with the static pandora interface (black background, bright white boxes) up for about 7 hours!  Needless to say, the image was quite evident when watching tv and especially when showing any solid colors on the screen.  I was heartbroken.  However, after two nights with \"break-in\" slides running, the image was all but gone.  A few days of regular tv watching later, it was completely gone.  Of course, this was after the TV had been somewhat broken in (at least 200 hours).  If that had happened out of the box, I'm not sure if it would ever go away.- Brightness: The TV is in our family room which has 4 windows close to it (in the kitchen) and a sliding glass door.  Even during the day with all of the windows and curtains open, I can see the tv fine (none of those windows are directly behind me while I am watching - instead, they are to the side).  With that much ambient light, the tv doesn't look as good, for sure, but I don't have any trouble seeing what is going on.  But if I am watching a movie or something, then I close the blinds and the appearance improves dramatically.- 3D: This is a weak point of the TV.  I bought 6 cheap Samsung 3D glasses and I'm just not very impressed.  This is one case where it seems too dark since the glasses are cutting out half of the light (active shutter).  I wish they had used passive on this plasma like they did with the LED TV I bought.  Fortunately I use 3D VERY rarely, so it's not a big deal to me.- Sound: Another weak point which was also a weak point on the Panasonic LED.  The sound quality is sub-par.  Some tweaking of settings helps, but it's pretty bad overall.  I usually just use my receiver and speaker system unless I don't need to understand what is being said.- Buzzing: I haven't noticed the buzzing at all, and I happen to be very nitpicky when it comes to buzzing noises like that.  However, there have been some times when I turn the tv on and then turn the volume down to talk to someone and my daughter asks what the buzzing noise is.  I have to get closer to even hear it, though.  I don't know, maybe my hearing is going, but at least for my tv this is not even close to an issue.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Meet our expecttion", "Author": "Purchased 3 weeks ago from Amazon", "ReviewID": "R3CBDFISE3IYMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We owned a 720p 42' Panasonic plasma for 5 years, very happy with itThe picture quality of this 55' is superb and is exactly what we want.We are unable to set up the wireless connection, however, this maybe due to incompatibility with the AT&T; routerOur only compliant is the acylic frame, it looks more like plastic not glassDelivery is excellent, they open the box make sure the product is in working condition and offer help to move the TV to our entertainment room and clean up package box.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic TC-55ST50 Plasma", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "R1UIOYQVTBBCSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this new plasma via Amazon.

A quick review of CNET brought up this TV as one of the most recommended for 2012 and the Amazon reviews supported that. It was the size I was looking for, so I bought it.I have not been disappointed. I did not bother making any adjustments to the display settings, but the picture looks great to me. I have not noticed any buzzing, which was mentioned by other reviewers. The design is classy and is all about the picture. I'm the type that needs the lights down and distractions minimized when I watch movies and always hated TV sets that have their logos glowing on the front panel and other such design nonsense.My only complaint is that one of the advertised features for this Internet TV is that it is Skype ready. I bought a Freetalk TV camera that was supposed to work with this TV but could never get it to work and returned the camera after my attempts to contact Panasonic and Freetalk about the issue went unanswered. The Panasonic manual for the TV, the support website and e-mail support were also useless for determining what camera I should get for this TV. Customer support is unresponsive.

One tip if you own this set, go to cnet find their review for this set and then calabrate the set to the calabration info that they offer, the only changes I made to their info was a brought sharpness back up to about 85 and I lowered the tint a little to take a little more of the green out. Out of the box the picture was great, but once I did the calabtation it was just awesome. The set looks good, clean and sleek, and the factory warnt. is an inhouse one.

If you are looking for a HD set, this plasma is for sure one to put on your list.

Clark", "ReviewID": "R2ZNUZXYZ8EP22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After searching and reading dozens of reviews on flat panel TVs I settled on the Panasonic. This is a great TV and has a great picture. I have not had any issues with Image Retention and am quite happy with the TV. I also have lots of windows in the room where I watch TV and I will say that reflections are not as big a problem as I thought. I was quite hesitant to go with Plasma because most reviews indicate that they don't do well in bright rooms. That hasn't been an issue for me. The biggest problem is going to be deciding on wall mount or TV stand.What I am not happy about is Amazon's \"price\" match/guarantee. I recently found this TV at Fry's for $999. I contacted Amazon for their low price guarantee and have been getting the run-around which is totally atypical of Amazon customer service. First they denied the claim because price matching is only done for other internet sites. So off I went to Frys.com and sure enough they have it listed there for $999. After informing them of this and asking about the claim they denied it for the following reason:\"The current price listed on frys.com is $999.00. After factoring in $129.99 for shipping and handling costs from frys.com to your shipping address, the total cost would be $1128.99. You paid $1,297.99 for your Amazon.com order.\"So I am not sure what kind of math they are using at Amazon but last time I checked $1128 is less than $1297. And while I understand they want to include the shipping and handling cost why then not include the cost of my Amazon Prime membership which is how I am able to get \"free\" shipping.And here's the irony. I still have plenty of time to return the TV for a refund, so if I wanted to go through the hassle I can send it back and buy it from my local Fry's and there would be no shipping charges.Summary: great TV you won't be disappointed but shop around as you can find this unit cheaper elsewhere.UPDATE-----UPDATE----UPDATEI responded to Amazon's denial email and received notice today that they were issuing a refund. So kudos to Amazon for the no-nonsense refund, at least once everyone agreed there was a price difference.

Great Amazon Warehouse Experience", "Author": "Christopher Baughman", "ReviewID": "RNE3M5E4BJJS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from Amazon Warehouse in \"Good Condition\". I chose the ST50 both because of the price of a used unit and to avoid a perceived input lag problem with the ST60 model. Rather than repeat what everyone else has said about the TV I will just say that I agree with the positive reviews. I will instead focus on my experience buying from Amazon Warehouse in the hopes it will help someone else buying last year's model used.First, it is important to understand that your TV will be shipped by a freight shipper. My shipper was CEVA Logistics. I was extremely nervous about this aspect and for good reason. I would have preferred to have just picked up the TV from a regular shipper myself but that was not an option. My experience was positive but do keep in mind that the shipper will be sending someone into your house to unpack your TV and verify it is working. If you are not comfortable with this you should seek a local purchase option.The shipper delivered my TV on the day scheduled although later in the day. They tried to get me to do the delivery on the Friday of the week because \"I was far away\" but I told them I was supposed to have it delivered on Tuesday and other than a mild monologue on the challenge involved they made it happen.I was expecting a couple of doofs I wouldn't trust around my kid's piggy bank but it turned out to be a very nice older guy. I am not sure how he would have gotten the TV into the house if I was not available to help. Be that as it may, he was very pleasant. He chatted amiably as we set up the TV, turned it on, and made sure it was working. He had experience with this kind of delivery before and wanted to make sure everything was AOK before he left. He told me about some cases with cracked TVs that they were happy to resolve. I kept the box in case I needed to do a return. My son was waving to him out the window as he got into his truck. A sign of a good experience. I still would have preferred my own pick-up.The TV itself was listed in \"Good\" condition. The TV I received had a small dent on the back that I did not notice for several days. Other than that one blemish it was pristine. It still had protective tape on the edges and an energy star ticket. The only other \"not brand new\" thing was some of the packing in the box was blown foam rather than the factory foam inserts. Other people who ordered TVs have received ones in less pristine condition (check the reviews) but mine was fantastic.Do read the descriptions carefully. Of the three available warehouse TVs, one was listed as missing pieces. That is not a good sign of a \"little or no use\" TV. I chose one that only listed cosmetic damage. I think it was either \"damaged in shipping\" or one that got returned right away when the original buyer found some nit they did not like. I am not exactly sure how many hours it had on it but checking the service menu when I got home later that night after an evening of family use, it showed just over 4 hours used. I assume my family put at least 3 hours on it while i was out. I do not know if that was something that could have been reset by Amazon but I think not.Over all the family is extremely excited about the TV. I got a nice Plasma that I always wanted. Screen glare has been a non-issue. I have yet to experience IR but we shall see. The wife was delighted I spent far less then we had budgeted. I was able to buy a used PS3 Slim for blu-ray (I highly recommend if you have a lot of DVDs for up-scaling), a remote extender box for my SageTV, associated accessories, and still be short of our original budget. I consider myself very fortunate. Not everyone had such a positive experience with either the shipper or with the quality of the TV. I hope that I was the rule rather than the exception.At this time I have not found out if I will be able to get Warranty service. If it comes up I will post back here with that one other possible gotcha.Good Luck!", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware of Panasonic plasmas", "Author": "Jon McDonald", "ReviewID": "R29LQCASF62J0X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a new Panasonic Viera plasma tv in 2011 and was very pleased with the performance and image quality of the unit.

We struggled with LED vs. Plasma, really liked the LED passive 3D option, but the active 3D is OK after you get used to it. We are using the cheaper Samsung 3D glasses.  The ST50 provides great off-angle viewing and good glare reduction as needed in our room.  Sound is not excellent but good.  No Image Retention issues with our mix of TV/movies. A little buzz (in rear of set) on bright scenes but not an issue.  Consumer Reports review is accurate for this set.Spent a lot of time measuring power consumption.  Set runs around 200-300 watts when calibrated to typical (eg; CNET) settings. This is fine in winter since room is too cold anyway.  Out of the box  power consumption is lower 75-125 Watts, and there are a number of energy conservation eco-settings in case you want to reduce heat output in summer. Thus, power use fairly high but controllable.Got the set from Amazon around Black Friday and CEVA delivery was fine.

Why doesn't Panasonic set the defaults differently?  I went to cnet's site and found their review of the TV (\"With flagship-level picture quality for a midlevel price, the Panasonic ST50 series sets the value standard among videophile-grade TVs\" and it \"was also awarded CNET's 2012 Editors' Choice in the plasma TV category.\")  Also searched cnet and found all of the settings that their TV geek used for this TV -- he changed many of the defaults and when we followed his exact settings, the picture improved enormously.  I'd recommend anyone buying this TV to do the same.Most reviews state that this TV is not the best choice for brightly lit rooms, but the room where we have our TV is dark so we didn't have any issues in that area.All in all, we're very happy with this TV and hopefully it will last longer than the Sony did.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Smatt TV it is", "Author": "John J.

It only took a few minutes to set up the TV. It took me longer to put the stand (included) together than getting a signal on the TV. It is a Panasonic SMART Viera and it lives up to its name. It connected to my wifi router instantly. The picture is outstanding, even in my very bright sunlit front room. You can see the picture from any angle. The colors are very bright. The 3D was an additional bonus. There are few programs broadcast in 3D (ESPN is the only one) but quite a few new DVD are 3D and WOW what a trip. It is really incredible to watch football, basketball and boxing in 3D. There are also a lot of 3D nature shows on Direct TV that are really amazing.

I bought the TV in October,2012 and Scheduled shipment on November 1st to my apartment (I also bought some stuff online from other websites around the same time) and along came Sandy Storm from nowhere and  I thought I won't get the TV on NOV 1st.But to my amazement the CEVA team delivered in the scheduled  time. We don't have power until Nov 7th and phone service until nov 4th and the other stuff I order online stayed in UPS and FEDEX warehouses for almost 2 weeks. But we have TV on time that is amazon....awesome. One more thing, price match....I bought the TV for $1250 in OCT and found same TV fro $999.99+$129 shipping on FRYS.COM website. I called amazon and they right away accepted and price matched. So finally I got the TV for $1129.99.. I have no issues with the tv. Its been 3 months.I didn't hear any hissing noise that others are complaining.Sound quality is good and I spent significant amount of time watch 3D blu rays. It worked well. One more important thing about this TV. No need to do any break-in as others are suggesting . that may be true for old plasma tvs but Plasma technology is so much matured now. as long as you play heavy games right from the first day and for hours you won't get the image burn issues.TO conclude...This is a very impressive TV ..great value for your money.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Viera tc-p55st50 55inch 600hz Full HD 3d Plasma tv", "Author": "Edwin L.

Saunders", "ReviewID": "R3DZT8NSFKZMPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This plasma is a huge upgrade to our LCD screen!!I was looking to replace our Sharp LCD 52\" tv and was initially looking at other LCD's because we have 3 large windows that look directly in on where the tv is and reflection is a problem.  I also wanted to future proof ourselves a bit with LAN\\internet connectivity - but nothing too fancy as we have other (and probably better) options when it comes to accessing the digital world.Just for ships and giggles I started to read plasma tv reviews instead of LCD's.  Cnet had the ST50 as their top pick for value with very high praise for the picture quality. I read review after review - my main concern was regarding reflections.  A lot of people said there was no problem and cnet indicated limited reflection in bright lit rooms.  So, with the morning light blaring in through our windows I can tell you that there sure as heck is reflection! ...but, you can still see the show without too much of a problem.  This is in contrast to the LCD that looked washed out and you had to move your head to see certain parts of the screen image.  Basically, there is reflection but it isn't as bad as the LCD and you can still watch your show - and this is the worst case scenario for us.During the day, when the light isn't dircetly focusing on the tv the picture is fantastic...tiny bit of reflection but not bad at all.  What is more distracting is the glossy edging if that tells you anything...I wish they made that matt!At night with two night lamps next to our couch and/or the overhead light there is zero reflection and the picture pops like never before - especially when you have just come from an LCD - everything is so vivid!I also used some custom settings to set up the image (provided in one of the reviews at amazon) but the picture was fine out of the box.I set up the remote app on the ipad - it seems to work okay.  There are a lot of options built in and it will take a bit to get used to using if you go that route - but you need to turn your tv on before you can use the app...so you still need the remote.I mounted the tv and only had a couple of minor issues.  The crossbar of our mount was directly in line with where the power plugs in.  That would be something to watch for if you are wall mounting - so you don't get it all set up and find that you have to pull it down again to plug the power in first.  The other thing was there are no wall mounting bolts included with the tv...you'd think that the company would splurge and include $1 or necessary hardware for mounting the thing...pain in the butt having to go to the hardware store and hope that you get the right bolts.  You will need 8mm bolts, no longer than 17mm long...it is in the manual in case you need to reference it.Picture viewing with the SD card is very nice!  Plug your card in and away you go with your slide show...very easy and convenient.I did a little browsing on the web - it is pretty clunky but workable as long as you plug in a keyboard.  It wouldn't be my primary web surfing option but it is an option if you set up a couple of favorites and then use it to check those sites (as an example) as the browser is set up to allow quick navigation to such.3D - haven't checked it out as it isn't why we got the tv...just happens to come with it...plus we don't have the glasses. :)We are extremely happy we the purchase and I am sure you will be too.  5 stars as I don't think there is a tv around that can stop direct sunlight reflecting to some degree.ps. as a side note - if you have the money to spare, go with the VT50 for an extra $400...we came close to buying the VT but we just aren't that hard core.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "irelande5", "ReviewID": "R1MVIZCGF96HJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had this TV for around 6 months now, its in the basement so it doesn't get used as much as it should, but it has a great picture, I calibrated with Disney Wow, and don't use the speakers, got it hooked up to Yamaha 7.1, great pairing.

Further should I ever choose to buy glasses and watch a movie in 3D I have that option, and the TV does a sufficient job at that.

Do not believe it. There is burn-in from channel logos that cannot be avoided. My son watched cartoon networks for 30 min and it was enough to burn the logo in. I had several conversations with panasonic and naturally they said its not covered by warranty.Their solution is to apply the vertical scroll bar that remove image retention 3 times per day for 3 weeks. It takes 15 min for each cycle. While its true that after doing it for a few days the burned logo starts to fade, it never goes away completely and it comes right back with full force after viewing the cartoon network again just once. Having to deal with this issue and crazy procedure of 3 times a day for 21 days is just too messy.Despite the great image quality - this TV is not recommended.

This was over 10 days ago and still there is no date set for repair. The repair company can only tell me that they are trying to get the parts (apparently not from Panasonic but from some third party company).

At least after calibrating the display as suggested on the web, which everyone should do, images are vivid and have wonderful apparent depth.  (I assume the latter is mostly a function of the black level and many shades of gray, but I don't really know.)  Material has included Comcast cable TV, Netflix streaming (via Xbox 360) and Xbox 360 games.  Despite playing a few games that have partially static display elements for hours at a stretch, I have not had any problems with image retention.  I've also been impressed with its performance in a light room, though the experience is sufficiently better with the lights low that I probably turn them off more often than I did when I had my LCD screen.  The only thing I don't love about the picture is that flaws in source material are more apparent than on lesser displays, but obviously the ST50 shouldn't be blamed for that.Panasonic provides a (free) iPad app that lets you control the TV, and frankly it's terrible.

Without hesitation I went back to Amazon where the Panasonic TC-P55ST50 caught my eye and ordered it.  When it arrived I thought wow, this TV rocks.  Unfortunately, soon after, I noticed what seemed to be screen retention or \"burn-in\" of some of my favorite television station logos.  I'm very aware of the risks in leaving the TV set to channels that display still pictures and took every precaution beforehand to avoid this, which is why my older plasma TV has no remnants of burn-in whatsoever.  After trying the anti-image retention option on the set countless times and using a pixel flipper repair DVD, I realized that there was no helping the situation ... the logos were there to stay.  My first thought was that this must be a lemon so I contacted Amazon and had the TV replaced with absolutely no problems.  That was 2 months ago and from the first moment the replacement TV was turned on I've been extra careful about still images or logos, to the point that I've been labeled crazy by my other half.  Sadly, even after taking every precaution against burn-in I'm now finding logos once again burned into the screen.

I called them today and told them if they can't get the parts then they need to either replace this TV or refund my money and pick this boat anchor up and haul it away.

As I indicated above I thought I'd try a service call to get the unit repaired.  A serviceman showed up a few days earlier than scheduled (on a Saturday which was fine by me) and decided to remove the back of the set to make sure nothing had come loose.  Checked a few connections, etc but no luck.  Said he'd found the culprit circuit board and will order one Monday and they usually come via 2-day air which would mean I'd have the unit today.  Called the serviceman this morning and was informed Panasonic delayed the board until next week.  Very disappointed.

A review of Panasonic's customer service...As an avid Panasonic customer (owning more than one Panasonic television and a couple of high-end Lumix cameras), I purchased a top-of-the-line 55 inch 3d Panasonic plasma TV (model VT25) less than two years ago (1 year, 8 months).  I expected to have this television for at least another 5 years (like previous televisions).One day while watching the TV, it abruptly turned off and would not turn back on. A small red LED light at the bottom of the TV was the only thing that flickered (blinking 11 times). I unplugged it and plugged it in again.  It would turn back on for a few seconds, before shutting off again (the red light blinking, mockingly).I called Panasonic and was told to bring it to a local repair shop where it could be diagnosed and repaired.  I was also informed me that my warranty had expired (the TV is only warrantied for 1 year) and I would be responsible for the repair costs.The TV repair shop diagnosed the problem as a bad A-board and fans.  The estimated price to repair it - $540!  I was shocked.  I called Panasonic and they said there was a possibility they would cover some or all of the cost. So, I sent the repair estimate and proof of purchase and waited to see if they would stand behind their top-of-the-line products and cover the cost of repair.I was told that I would hear back within 72 hours. 3 days later I still had not received a response. No phone call, no email.  I called customer service to find out what had happened.  The customer service representatives were friendly enough and confirmed that they had received my claim information, but they didn't know why I had not been contacted. They told me they would send a message to those responsible for repair claims and I should hear back from someone in 24-72 hours. 3 days came and went without any communication from Panasonic. Again, I called customer service. Though they were again friendly, I was told (once again), that I would hear back from someone in 24 hours.  I, again, waited and, again, heard nothing.  This scenario repeated for another 2 weeks and 3 more phone calls.  Finally (thoroughly exasperated and out of patience), I insisted on speaking with someone higher up.  I expressed my incredible frustration. My TV had now been at the repair shop for a month with absolutely no response from Panasonic! I had done all the work, repeatedly calling, spending numerous hours with customer service, each time re-explaining the situation.  Panasonic had made no effort to contact me.  After explaining this to the Panasonic representative and some discussion, he said all they could offer me was a little over $100.  I was offended, considering I had made all the effort and the repair costs were over $500 (a quarter the cost of a new TV!).  I expressed my disappointment and dissatisfaction and after more tense conversation, he said the final amount they could offer was $216.  I was forced to accept this, as it was clear the disaffected, monotone Panasonic rep would not offer a dime more.  I was left to pay more than half the repair cost.I am sad to say that all my faith in Panasonic products has vanished. If they are unwilling to stand behind the quality of their top-of-the-line products (less than two years old), then I fear the quality of Panasonic is not what it once was.

The box clearly states in several places in large print that this item is a \"TEAM LIFT\".  Third, if my husband had not been here I would not have received my TV as it was too big and heavy to be handled by one person.  Fourth, once the TV was inside the delivery person tried to leave without unboxing the TV and placing it in the correct room.  We had to show him the paperwork from AMAZON that required him to unbox the TV and check to make sure it worked.  He did not believe us so he called his office and they said he had to do what the paperwork required.  Again my husband had to help carry the TV from the foyer to the living room and help unbox the TV.  He did not check to see if the TV worked due to the fact that it was under 50 degrees and you were not supposed to turn on the TV until it warmed up.  That part I understand completely.  We waited until the TV was warmed up and everything worked fine.  The only hard part after assembling the stand was lifting the TV onto the TV entertainment center.  It takes two people.

Picture looked pretty good, though not at all as great as what Id read. I am a tv nerd and calibrated the thing all week to try and improve it but the colors just didn't pop like my old plasma did. The biggest issue I had with this set was in its lack of handling non hd material. From cable to dvd's it absolutely sucked. I tried different settings, players, you name it and it never improved. The up-conversion on this set is awful.That being said blue rays looked fantastic and the 3d was pretty good as well, though I did see some noticeable ghosting.Another major issue I saw was in how this set handled black transitions and high speed scenes in movies. I know I know the specs say it should be perfect but it was not at all. The set had a jiggering effect in action scenes and I could visibly see the colors shifting from darks to lights. Again I am a previous plasma owner of 8 years and never saw this on my Philips.This TV was really disappointing to me overall and I returned it to Amazon.

This is true, if you meet the following criteria: 1. you have a dark viewing environment; 2. you watch HD/16:9/cinema aspect programming almost exclusively; and 3. you live in a cold weather climate or your home has air conditioning.  1. This set does get very bright - plenty bright for our fairly bright living room.  But any time the picture displays a lot of white, or bright colors, the Automatic Brightness Limiter (ABL) kicks in, and kicks in hard.  ABL automatically dims the panel, rendering whites grey or yellowish -- supposedly to increase the panel's lifespan -- and taking the overall brightness and contrast of the image with it.  It cannot be turned off.  We watch a lot of programming with abundant whites, and I found the ABL to be extremely distracting.  Proponents of plasma tech will argue that these grey- or yellow-white tones are \"true white\" and \"more accurate\" compared to the bright white of LCD displays.  It simply isn't true.  This set simply cannot reproduce full-screen white in a bright room.  2. Viewing 4:3 content on this TV was disappointing.  I prefer to view content at its intended aspect ratio; meaning for 4:3 content I prefer to have the black bars on the side.  Except on this TV they are not black bars - they're grey.  Why grey?  I have no idea.  It's really distracting, and can't be changed.  There are two other aspect options for 4:3 content: Fill and Just.  Fill is a simple stretch which makes everyone and everything look unnaturally wide.  Just is a graduated stretch where objects in the center of the screen look normal but begin to stretch out as they travel to the sides of the screen.  It's lazily implemented and frustrating to watch while objects stretch horizontally whenever moving.  3. Oh man, does this TV get hot!  We don't have AC, and running this thing in the middle of summer caused our place to become very noticeably hotter than when watching the LCD unit it replaced.  Walking in front of the set I could feel it radiating heat from a couple feet away.  On the bright side, it works well as a space heater.There are positive features.  The 2D picture quality -- aside from the ABL -- is excellent.  The colors and black levels are great, and skin tone is very natural and lifelike.  The horizontal viewing angle is phenomenal.  Screen reflections were minimal (though the overall image quality did seem a tad 'soft', most likely due to the reflection filter). The set itself is very thin and attractive.  There are a lot of adjustments available in the picture settings menus.  Panasonic's Motion Smoother technology is much better than many other manufacturers' and avoids the 'soap opera effect'.  Input lag on Game Mode is very low and playable (lag is noticeable on all other picture modes).  Image processing on all modes is fast and we didn't experience any audio sync issues like we had with the LG 55lw5600 LED-LCD.For me, the big issues were too much and I returned the set.  I ended up purchasing the Panasonic TC-L55ET5 LED-LCD display to replace it, with which I am very happy so far.  The picture is only very slightly inferior to this set, but without the ABL, excessive heat, or dumb grey bars when viewing 4:3 content.  It's so nice to see white again!

Even if the set is working great now, they have a terrible record of them breaking just after warranty. The 2010 models all developed a rising black level problem, where the blacks would become lighter and when it was discovered Panasonic said it was on purpose. So they advertised a black level they could not keep.Now many the 2011 models all are developing a fluctuating brightness problem where the brightness of the screen will jump up and down. This is a known defect to Panasonic, yet if your set develops this problem after 1 year (if you don't put too many hours on it) they are leaving you with the repair bill. I was told I would have to cover any repair cost myself for this issue, since the warranty was up, yet the set has low hours so it wouldn't show the problem until the warranty was up anyway. So my Panasonic plasma was good for exactly one year one month. Had this been a one off case I would even be a bit understanding, but this is a huge and known issue that many 2011 sets have that Panasonic is leaving their customers to deal with.Unfortunately Panasonic's track record with customer service and quality control are not to be trusted.

The sound is only tolerable on my stereo  The set is less than 4 months old. But I know what my favorite channels are - THEIR LOGOS ARE BURNT INTO THE SCREEN!!!  And Panasonic - the major run-around. Don't buy the story that burn in is no longer an issue.
