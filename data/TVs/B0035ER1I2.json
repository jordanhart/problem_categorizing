Miller", "ReviewID": "R273IRMPIXI1M8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After pretty much researching TVs to death, we purchased the Sony Bravia EX 500 and couldn't be happier.  We wanted a 40\" TV because it would fit nicely in our TV Armoire cabinet.  I throw value into the equation, so I don't hesitate to give this 5 stars.Highlights:1) Crystal clear 1080p HDTV broadcast and BluRay performance.2) The voice clarity comes through incredibly clear.  I used to have to crank up the volume much higher to understand conversations on movies and TV shows.3) The standard definition comes in much better than our old 720p HDTV, but we spend most of our time on the HDTV channels.4) You'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between this TV and those costing twice as much for the same size.Lowlights:1) This is minor, but I'll keep it honest.  Jutter is noticeable in faster moving camera pans and action, but hardly on BluRay which has me wondering how much has to do with the frequency of the broadcast vs. the TV.  We watched \"Iron Man\" on the BluRay and it looked great.2) It's rated at 150k:1 contrast ratio which pales in comparison to the 2MM:1 and higher on LEDs and Plasmas.In summary, we're very happy with the performance of the Sony Bravia EX 500.  At present, I don't know if there's a better combination of price and performance.  We're value conscious, so we're extremely satisfied with this purchase.", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful TV...once configured properly!", "Author": "JerryWithaJ", "ReviewID": "R32TXY98YAZLJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would have sent this TV back but for another review.  I found the picture WAY too dark, but I'd read a review saying that this was due to the TV being shipped with Auto-Contrast turned on.  On this model it's called \"Ambient Sensor\".  Go to Menu/Settings/Picture/Ambient Sensor.  Turn it off and the picture is as bright and crisp as you could want.  \"Ambient Sensor\" is the last of the Picture options.  It does not appear when Picture is first selected.  It is necessary to scroll down to the end (or, equivalently, up one) to access it.That done, I had a bright, crisp picture, but there was something still not quite right.  For lack of anything else to try, I checked the settings on my L series 32\" Sony HDTV that this is replacing and found that the settings were different.  After setting Scene Select to General, I set this 40\" TV to the settings on the 32\", namely, Backlight to 8 and Picture to 90.  The resulting picture is nothing short of incredible!!-----------------------------------Added in edit:  The more I view this TV, the more I like it.  The HD picture has a 3D quality to it, even though this is not a 3D set.The more I use it, the more I HATE the remote!  It makes one wonder whether the engineers who designed it ever tried using it. You can see a picture of it about 1/3 of the way down the page, on the left. Like every other remote, it has a button surrounded by a ring:  press the top of the ring to go up, the bottom to go down, the right side to move right, the left side to move left.  All well and good...so far.  The problem is the ring of buttons that surrounds it.  Even though I've had the tv for only a week, I can't count the number of times I pressed Favorites only to then press MENU when I'd intended to press the bottom of the inner ring.  The outer ring of buttons should have been placed in two horizontal rows somewhere else.  However, as annoying as the remote is, the picture is so great that I would not reduce the star ranking.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Quality for the price", "Author": "Reader B \"avid reader\"", "ReviewID": "R6YLRR5E0V6D0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the second Sony LCD HDTV I have.  My other is the KDL-40Z4100.  Sony provides high quality for the price.I use rabbit ears to get over the air signals, and it pulls in all the stations available. The picture is crisp, and in watching a DVD (up converted) of The Dark Knight, I noticed no loss of resolution during fast scenes.  I haven't had a chance to watch a Blu-Ray on it yet. I have a Sony Blu-Ray player, so it syncs nicely.The downside?  Well, when you turn it on, you get a chime sound.  The plus is that is is fast in going between channels, although the favorites only hold the last 10 channels, and the remote leaves a lot to be desired.  Other than the number buttons, the buttons are a bit small and crowded.  Not sure why it has an ON button on the back side, as well as in the expected place. The remote for my KDL-40Z4100 is far better.The sound is all right;  nothing to really write home about.I have it in a room where the light levels will change quite a bit, and so far have not noticed any issues.  There is a light sensor that is supposed to help adjust the picture to ambient light levels.  One can select different picture settings (movie, general, etc.) but I haven't found a need to select those.The set looks good, and it has a swivel base.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Second time is a charm.", "Author": "Adam J. Murphy", "ReviewID": "R26ZFBRWNXS5G5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let's start off by saying that this is my 4th Sony TV purchase but only my 1st Sony LCD experience.  I entered the LCD era years ago with Budget brands such as ViewSonic and Westinghouse and was very satisfied.  Yet I'm always looking to upgrade.  This 40\" set replaced a perfectly working 36\" Sony 720p CRT monster (219lbs), only because the entertainment center started to crumble around the mass.  I still have all 3 of my old Sony CRT TV's and will never get rid of them.So, I've always lusted after a Sony LCD but the prices were always a tad too high.  Then came along this 40\" Bravia and the time and Price was right.  Shipping was quick, I was always in touch with the shipping company.  The TV arrived 4 days later, box in perfect condition, not a scratch on it.  That is where the honeymoon ended.  After switching out TV's, putting in the new entertainment center, transfering all of my components over and hooking everything up per the manuals instructions....It was time to power it on.  It turned on fine, started the initial set up....Then turned off all by itself and proceded to do so 3 more times then just stayed off while blinking a series of red lights below.  I unplugged, reconected with other cables just incase.  Same problem, off then on then off 3 more times then the same lights.  I instantly had flashbacks of my 7 Xbox's going through the dreaded RROD (Read Ring of Death).Called Sony support.  Once they ran through the trouble shooting they asked for a time sequence on the lights and then quickly put me on hold.  Then the agent said very stern, unplug the TV and you will need to do an exchange due to an internal error.  The TV is broken!  Essentially DOA!  What was supposed to be a quick exchange according to Sony turned into a 2 week turn around.  Some say I should have just returned it through amazon, I tried but the TV wasn't in stock, so I would have had to wait for the credit to my account before purchasing a new brand and that would have taken 2 weeks acording to the amazon rep.  So I waited for a tracking number from Sony.  Then came the news of a 3 week arrival time.  I almost lost it, but as luck would have it, it shipped early and arrived yesterday, 9 days from the initial call to Sony support.The replacement works great, the set up went through 100%.  All of my components works great.  The Picture is amazing.  The menu is easy to use.I do have one set of complaints with reguards to the amount of inputs and this is where it looses a star for me.  Being an older gamer that has a young child.  I like to have the option of hooking up my older systems for him to learn on (N64, SNES, his Vtech) but in this age of HDMI, TV makers are putting allot less standard inputs.  I had no problem hooking up the PS3 and Cable box via HDMI, but things got a little interesting when it came time to hook up the Wii, original Xbox and Bose 321 system via component...there are only 2 component inputs.  No prob, I'll just throw the Bose onto a S-video because we only use the Bose for my Son's movies to help limit disc time on the PS3.....but there is No S-video.  Ok, I'll just dump that onto a standard RCA...I can't because my Son's V-Tech has taken the only standard RCA.  Solution was to give the Bose back it's component slot, Split the wires for the Xbox and Wii.  I did not want to get into the whole thing of using a System selector as I have done in the past...too much clutter.  I have a feeling I may have to go to a system selector if we decide to hook up the N64 and SNES for him.Reguardless of my problems with the 1st TV, I am still a fan of the Sony brand.  These DOA LCD's seem to happen with every brand and it was just luck of the draw.  If you search online, there are plenty of stories of DOA units right out of the box.  Sony support gets a C+ only in the fact that they got a replacement out to me in 9 days instead of the stated 21 days.  They need to work on their customer support especially compared to Amazon where the Amazon reps bend over backwards to help the customer.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Above average PQ - TOO MUCH PLASTIC!", "Author": "TronixSage", "ReviewID": "R14N9TCEK6T3TW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV after I ran into problems with THREE Samsung LN40C650's. The Samsungs all had terrible backlight bleeding and flashlighting and was totally unacceptable to say the least.I spent countless hours at Best Buy after I changed my mind about Samsung TVs and this Sony TV was in the running with the LG 42LD550.Upon comparison of the two, I noticed the Sony did seem to have slightly better PQ and it seemed to handle motion and patterns better than the LG. On the flip side, the LG does have an extra 2\" of screen, internet features and the menu settings were slightly more customizable than the Sony.Ultimately, I decided that the PQ was most important and though the internet features would be nice (with the LG) I could always connect my laptop or Roku (via HDMI).The TV was shipped via UPS and arrived with the box in near perfect condition. I allowed sufficient time for the TV to warm up and at the end of the day, I assembled the stand and hooked up the TV to my desktop computer via VGA.ASSEMBLY & QUALITY:Assembly was quick and effortless, but I have to mention that the quality of this TV compared to the Samsung is definitely lacking. Everything is made of plastic...from the stand to the remote and to the TV. The Samsung stand is made from about 9 lbs of glass and metal and the back of the Samsung TV is made from metal. The only thing plastic on the Samsung is the bracket that attaches the TV to the stand, but this plastic is about 1/2\" thick and is actually more rigid than the little bit of metal Sony used for the bracket that attaches the TV to the base of the stand.If I would have purchased this Sony TV from Best Buy (or other local retailer) for approximately $800-900 (what it has sold for in the past) I would have immediately boxed it back up and returned it. I can't believe Sony can offer such a cheesy product with absolutely no additional features (such as internet) for a premium price.NETFLIX THRU DESKTOP COMPUTER:After everything was set up, I connected my desktop computer to the TV (via VGA) and signed in to my Netflix account so I could do a preliminary test.I watched \"My Cousin Vinny\" and was impressed with the PQ even though I was watching it in SD.I then packed everything up, went home and setup the TV in my bedroom (it's new home).HD CABLE & UPCONVERTED SD DVDs:Like the Samsungs, the Sony has an Optical Audio out, which works just perfect for me since my receiver has that connection. There seemed to be almost no audio lag at all and the sound was more even compared to the Samsung. When watching cable programming with the Samsung, I needed to turn the volume way down, but with DVDs I needed to turn it way up. With the Sony, both cable programming and DVDs play at about the same level and I don't have to keep fidgeting with the volume on my receiver.HD cable looks just fine on this set and I would say the PQ is above average, but is still lacking when compared to the Samsung. The Sony does have more \"noise\" overall, but I found that if you change the Noise Reduction setting to high, this helps tremendously.Upconverted SD DVDs were played with outstanding clarity BUT ONLY with daytime scenes. With dark scenes, the PQ was very grainy. I wonder if this may be due to the upconverted DVD player. I think maybe the process of upconversion is not playing nicely with the Bravia engine software. I will try to hook up my DVD player via component cables to see if that reduces the grainy image during dark scenes.The Samsung had absolutely no problem playing HD cable or upconverted SD DVDs.MOTIONFLOW:I don't like this feature...probably because you can't really fine-tune it. You can choose from Off, Standard or High. With the Samsung, I preferred to have their comparable feature turned to Clear, but you had about 4 settings to choose from and you could individually adjust the blur & jitter. Again, for a slightly sub $1,000 TV, I can't believe Sony didn't offer more.SCREEN UNIFORMITY:This TV does have some very slight uniformity issues. There is an extremely small amount of flashlighting in the upper corners and in the upper middle of the screen, but I've only noticed this once during the movie I watched - which did have quite a bit of dark scenes. Compared to the Samsung, the Sony is perfect. You wouldn't believe the extreme amount of screen issues I experienced with the 3 Samsungs.AFFORDABILITY:For under $600 how can you go wrong? The TV works & looks good and the PQ is probably next in line compared to the Samsung. Though it lacks some key features, it is a solid performer and I hope it lasts for quite a while.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sweet Sony Bravia EX 500", "Author": "AUWGL-UNC \"Gray\"", "ReviewID": "R1C2NDPLY5BKRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first HD TV and I couldn't be happier.  I had been shopping HD TV's for more than a month beginning my search a few weeks before Thanksgiving with hopes of getting the best price on Black Friday or Cyber Monday.  That would not be the case as many stores had sales for this size HDTV a week before Thanksgiving and I would not see those prices again until after Christmas.  This gave me plenty of time to do my research and wait for the prices to fall.  Basically my search came down to 3 HD TV's all 1080p - the Sony 40 inch EX 500 which I purchased; the LG 42LD520, 120 Hz and the Panasonic Plasma TC-P42S2, 600 Hz.From the beginning when I first saw the Sony in Best Buys I was blown away by the picture but the price was just a bit out of my range - $750 plus.  My wife liked the LG and my father had just purchased the Panasonic Plasma.  I knew I wanted the 120 Hz or 600 Hz for better sports viewing and yes there is a difference between the 60 Hz and anyone who tells you otherwise are not watching sports or action movies.  I also had an odd want in that I wanted the HDTV to also look very good in Standard Definition.  I wanted to be able to TIVO some shows in SD for use of less storage space on my DVR but I still wanted the picture to be as good as or better than my current Sony WEGA.  The LG and Plasma just didn't do it for me on the SD stations.Next consideration was price, the LG and Panasonic run about $100 less than the Sony depending on when you look you can find these both for under $650.  The Sony was always hanging out at $760ish.  A few nights after Christmas I was online checking prices as I had been doing what seemed daily since Thanksgiving.  That night I noticed Amazon had the Sony 40 inch 500 for $642, the Sony was now a few dollars less than the LG and the Panasonic, I had to make my move to purchase it and my wife concurred.The time of delivery took less than a week my buddy and I hooked it up and all worked great.  The first big sporting event I watched was the National Championship game with my Auburn Tigers beating Oregon.  It blew me away how good this TV looked in HD; I'm sure my wife grew tired of hearing me say how good the TV looked; even on SD this TV looks great.  I'm very pleased with my purchase and would still be very satisfied if I had paid the current going rate of this TV.As far as the few items people touch on in these reviews that lean negative.  (1) The controller being cheap, the controller is what it is and its functions work very well, it may not be the best feeling controller you have ever had but it gets the job done.  Plus if you use a cable box, TIVO or SAT TV your main controller is most likely to be that other controller to control that device. (2) The chime that comes on when your TV turns on, personally I like the Sony chime and like one reviewer wrote you just know you have a great TV.  I think you can turn this off and for me I run my TV through my external speakers and the volume on the Sony is always down so I never hear it anymore.  (3) The speakers for the TV I can't really comment due to running my sound through external speakers but when I have run the sound I've been impressed, the fact is the TV is not going to sound as good as your home theater system.  (4)  The blacks or darks not coming through as sharp - this is the one thing I'm still studying and it may have to do with my settings but I have noticed at times some darks/blacks do not come through as sharp - I'll read some setting reviews and see if I can find anything to improve on it.All and All it's a great HDTV and if you are looking to make your first HD purchase or your tenth I would go Sony.Here are the settings that work for me, my wife and I find ourselves watching prime time TV shows, movies and sports:Picture Mode: CUSTOM (**Note each setting (Vivid, Standard Custom, Game-Standard Game-Original etc) are slightly different by default.)Backlight: 3 (WOW-ness without over doing it)Picture: 85 (there really isn't a reason to have it lower or higher)Brightness : 50 ( 50 hits Custom's mark for absolutely no loss of shadow detail)Color : 50Hue : 0Color Temperature : NeutralSharpness : 1 (I've settled with a not so noisy picture. looks VERY professional. 1 is perfect for Custom.)Noise Reduction : OffMPEG NR : OffMotionflow: StandardCineMotion: offAdvanced SettingsBlack Corrector : offAdvanced CE : offGamma : offClear White : LowLive Color : offWhite Balance : Factory default (all zero)", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome All Around TV", "Author": "Patrick Mcinerney \"Electronics Guru\"", "ReviewID": "R1NYLVHRI4NYZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this tv because I needed a solid all purpose TV. I wanted a TV that I could watch cable on, play my PS3 on and use as a computer monitor. So far this TV has excelled at all 3.I looked everywhere for info on this tv and came up with very little while I was considering buying. However after I saw it in the Sony Store, and they finally published all the stats for the TV I thought it would be a good fit. I say search around for the best price on this one. I used bing cashback and got a sick deal.Anyway now onto the TV.I use this in my room, and is the 3rd LCD screen that we own. 1st is an older XBR 52\" 1080p 120hz. Its a nice tv but a bit dated. We have had it for a few years. This ex500 i think gets a better picture quality when watching HD rated Bluray or HD TV. The other TV is a generic 32\" 720p and 60hz. So needless to say this is a huge upgrade over that.Watching regular TV is ok. Its not great quality, as SD channels come in a bit blury. Its not to say its bad, and if you only watch SD Channels it wont really make a difference to you, but when you have HD channels to compare it to, the SD is kinda crud.PS3 is beautiful. The 1080p looks amazing, and there is no tv lag or blur in the games. I play a wide range of games (From frantic FPS' to RPGS) and the graphics all are beautiful.PC also synced flawlessly. The videocard i was using was a bit low end so it wasnt the greatest transition to full screen, and the computer lagged a bit trying to process for such a large aspect ratio. I am getting a newer pc soon though with a video card that can handle the high end aspect ratios.USB video - sadly its one feature i havent been able to test. Since I have a PS3 Ive been using that to watch video off of a USB, and also all my videos are .avi, while the TV only supports .mpg off of the USB stick. This was slightly disappointing. However, the TV immediately recognized the USB and played music and images off of it with no problem.All in all this TV is great for the price. It has a lot of high end features and you can get a decent deal on one.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT SONY BRAVIA EX 500 HDTV", "Author": "Texas wood reclaimer \"Texas wood reclaimer\"", "ReviewID": "R287RSPX0SB81T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We spent at least 2 months searching for the right television.

I primarily watch TV (non-HD variety), watch DVD's, play PlayStation 3 games and use for BluRays, until I decide on which model Sony BluRay Player/ DVD Up-Scale capabilities. The picture is AWESOME, multiple settings, quite user-friendly, and for the HD format, it is unbelievably crisp and sharp. As with most HDTV's, expect to get an external sound system, the one built-in is not horrible, but by no means is on par with picture. Has the neat Bravia Sync technology, that makes it easier to use all you Sony Bravia Sync compatible items with, ie. PS3, Sony BluRay Players, etc. Did a lot of homework on specs, and this is the one I came down to when it was dollars versus specs, totally worth the money. Again, it doesn't have as many of the newer bells and whistles, but, if you want the basics with great features, then I would say this model, or the 42\" if you want larger, should be in your final three. Also, the power problem that I've seen in other reviews is no longer relevant, as long as you don't get one of the ones off the line first, they have corrected that glitch, I spoke with their customer service (because similar issue is why I was having to get a new TV).

J. \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R2962DPFRZ3679", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My previous HDTV was a 40\" 120Hz Samsung. Less than 2 years old and I had nothing but problems with the Samsung so decided to go with what I've had good luck with in the past. Just to name a few problems I had with the Samsung to put this in perspective, remote control battery contacts sucked and the remote had to be pounded on the palm of the hand to work after sitting over night (poor quality plating on contacts), TV channels would change intermittently and had to rescan to obtain lock on the correct channel, red lines in picture would appear intermittently, Picture would flicker or roll horizontally on the lower part of the screen after the unit went out of warranty, after a year and a half, TV would shut down after being on for an hour or two. I'd say the Samsung was the worst TV as far as reliability that I've ever had in 45 years. I'm not the only one that has had problems with Samsung in my family, My sister, also has problems with hers.So far I'm happy with the Sony. Great picture. vivid colors and no quirks. I like the auto contrast which adjusts based on ambient lighting as it seems to work well. I even played with it using a flashlight on the sensor to see how it affects the pictures. Yes, it really does adjust the picture.One thing my Samsung had that I could not find in a new TV was dual cable inputs. That us, one for cable and one for antenna. I only have basic cable which gets all the local channels in HD (no cable box). I used this cable/antenna feature when cable goes out, which happens quite often here. That way I didn't have to re-scan the channels and could just switch over to Antenna with a push of a button. No rescan required. Well, I was surprised that the Sony has dual channel scan, one for cable and one for antenna and remembers the channels for each. I just had to buy a cable switch so that I can change from cable to antenna inputs then change the input selection in the Sony setup to antenna. Works well (not quite as easy as the Samsung since it's two steps but acceptable). I know this is not likely a feature most people would need but I was pleasantly surprised that it had it.  On a side note and interestingly enough, not a single sales person at any of the stores I went to knew about this feature as I specifically asked if there was a dual cable input TV available like my older Samsung and explained that I didn't want to have to rescan every time I switched to antenna from cable.A few things I am disappointed with is the lack of controls on the remote. The remote is very basic. The Samsung had keys on the remote to do just about everything. The Sony remote has far fewer keys and controls are menu based. That is, you can control everything but will take multiple key stokes to get where you want to get to. My Samsung has a 55 key remote. The Sony has a 41 key remote. That is, if you want to go to your HDMI input 4, you have to go to a menu and then arrow up or down to the input then hit enter or wait until it defaults to it. It would be better in my opinion if they had a key for each HDMI input so I didn't have to sift through a menu to go to it. Also, it would be nice if the Sony could lock out channels. For example, if I want to go to channel 5.1 and there is no analog channel on channel 5.0, why does it go to channel 5.0 when I push \"5\"? Ideally it should recognize that I want to go the channel 5.1 since there is no channel at 5.0, like the Samsung did. Sony requires that you enter \"5\" then \".\" then \"1\" otherwise it will just go to the off-air channel \"5\". Yes, it skips the non-air channels using the up and down channel keys so this is just an annoyance when entering channels directly.I haven't owned this Sony long enough to comment about longevity. One thing I do know is that I had so many problems with Samsung that I will likely never buy one again. I also can say that the two other Sony TVs I've had in the past 30 years were very reliable. As a matter of fact, the only reason I replaced my older Sony TVs were to upgrade technology, not due to defect. Samsung rates a zero as far as quality as far as I'm concerned. Yes, Samsung picture quality is great, when they are working. The problem is, they just don't work very long.After my experience with Samsung, I did buy an extended warranty with this Sony purchase, unlike my Samsung purchase, but with any luck, I won't need it. My two-bits, if you chose a Samsung, don't expect it to last. Buy an extended warranty!

The black monolithic minimalist design with a band of brushed gunmetal grey aluminum on the bottom is a perfect match for my Harman Kardon setup, as if these Sonys were just made for the current Harman Kardon lineup.  The only possible drawback to this design is the sound--the bottom-facing speakers, necessary for the monolithic appearance, are fine in themselves but don't deliver quite the punch as the front-facing speakers on my older Sony Bravia, but this isn't really an issue for me since I do most of my listening through external speakers anyway.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Picture!", "Author": "Rocky Mountain Reader \"em\"", "ReviewID": "RL09OHXKEY8A7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We originally purchased the LG 42\" LED-LCD flatscreen TV but returned it because we didn't like the picture (just not a true to life picture).

I was always a samsung person  but my cable guy worked with all the sets in repair dept of a major electronics store and said samsungs were 90 percent of his business and Sony's almost never.

It has fairly easy setup, although it will take some tweaking to get the picture just right. Right out of the box, the ambient sensor is set to on. So when you first turn it on, the picture will appear dark. This can simply be fixed by going into the settings and turning it off. Adjusting the back light will also brighten the picture. Spend some time playing with the settings and you should be pleased with the resulting picture. As far as the 120HZ motion flow feature, I haven't seen much benefit. I have watched a few basketball games and noticed some blurring but not enough to ruin the picture. I guess its better than 60HZ...maybe.

I think if you have 1080 lines of resolution, the rest is mostly window dressing. Sure, the refresh rates have jumped from 60 to 120hz, and some are now even 240hz, but for the life of me I don't see much of a difference. All LCD display surfaces are made by just a few Asian companies, in large sheets, 12 feet by 20 feet or something, which they cut to sizes requested by manufacturers.  So the screens themselves are the same for all brands. I suppose the newer LED backlighting is a tangible difference, but just as with refresh rates, there is very little evidence any of us can see a difference.  If you need gobs of HDMI inputs, that might make on TV better than another, but until 3D television gets rolling a few years from now, all brands are about the same.That's not to say the Sony BRAVIA EX 500 Series 40-Inch LCD TV, 1080i, 120hz, Black is not an excellent television, it most definitely is excellent ... bright and beautiful.  But all brands and models are bright and beautiful, if the source video is good and the picture is adjusted properly.  And the adjustments are complicated on LCD and plasma sets ... there's a heckuva lot more than the Color, Tint, Contrast and Brightness we grew up with.  And that sums up my advice: Don't worry so much about 120, 240hz, or even LED backlighting.
