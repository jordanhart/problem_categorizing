{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Nelson Alejandro", "ReviewID": "R3STQY2QNWYB77", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv from microcenter yesterday, and could not be happier. 55 inches and a beautiful, clear bright picture. I paid 899 for it. The 3d is great. It is passive 3d, which is viewable with glasses which do not require batteries. It converts 2d to 3d with the flick of a switch on the included universal remote. it has 240 hz refresh rate, and sports and fast moving objects look great.  it has a very slim bezel and seems to float on its stand. It also includes a wireless keyboard for surfing the net, and 4 pair of toshiba branded 3d glasses in the box. the set includes 4 hdmi inputs as well as a plethora of other inputs including 2 usb ports. The toshiba 55l7200u is a great product, and one should not hesitate to buy it. Blu ray movies look wonderful. The only minor thing about the set is the sound which has to be brought up about 60 percent during the day. However this is not a deal breaker because it is loud enough, and actually produces good sound reproduction. The tv is very slim, and its stand is stable and turns side to side. This tv competes as well as much more expensive samsungs and LG.  Great set.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tech  or not tech", "Author": "SS \"SJS\"", "ReviewID": "RKFJ53KJMUZQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for over a year now and have not have any problems or issues.  The 3D as well as 2D works great.  The apps work great wirelessly (did not have to run coax cable across house.  The smart apps work I guess as smart as you are !!

This takes about 5 minutes each time, I can honestly say that this happens at least twice a week.The 'smart TV' part of  this set is very frustrating to operate.  It looks and feels as if all of the various components were hobbled together.  The media player is quite basic and does not allow for many popular movie formats, such as XVID, etc.  Due to all of these annoying setbacks, I end up using my WD box most of the time.The TV picture itself is decent and the sound is surprisingly good,  but if you are not using this as a smart tv, you can probably get a better deal on another set.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice 3D HDTV.", "Author": "Chris Martin \"CM\"", "ReviewID": "R2OHRNYGG7QWSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's start with the 3D feature...it is absolutely marvelous. The 3D is passive with several pairs of 3D glasses and is easy on the eyes, superior sound and a crisp picture makes for a very enjoyable 3D viewing experience. As for the other features.....the 240 hz really makes a BIG difference when it comes to watching fast-moving sports. Motion blur is non-existence as is the soap opera effect. I've only had the set for 2 weeks and I can't stop watching it. The size of the set is very impressive and the setup was very easy. The weight of the set is such that I was able to lift it alone and place it where I want it. The bezel is made of glass and is kinda of heavy. The TV has a swivel base that makes it easy to turn the set in either direction. This LED TV nay not be the perfect passive 3D set on the market, but in my eyes. it sure is a strong contender (at least in the 55inh size range. The sheer size of the set will knock your socks off). I would highly recommend this set to anyone.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too many issues", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R3K2FW9940OTD4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Cons: wireless sets the wrong network settings(IP, gateway),so you have to manually go in and set the proper ones or spend time and money running an Ethernet cable across your house.The wireless keyboard only works the menu and web browser, doesn't work in Netflix, YouTube.You cannot download additional apps other then the 5 provided with the TV.The navigation arrows on the remote are surrounded with buttons making using the remote without looking at it almost impossible.The Enter key on the keyboard doesn't confirm entry, you have to press the F4 key(Blue button).The smartTV functions are lacking compared to other manufacturers(ie. LG, Samsung)Pros:3D works well, 2D to 3D looks alright(depending on the content being watched), you can use the realD glasses from the movie theatre(if the 4 sets of glasses are not enough).Thin bezel around screen makes the screen feel big.Colors and brightness are sharp, even when wearing 3D glasses.Conclusion:Good if you just want a 3D TV, but problems with setup and operating the other features, makes for a headache and wasting time trying to get it to work.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Value for Great Performance.", "Author": "NT", "ReviewID": "R2PO0ORALJTCMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My only CON is with Amazon.ca versus Amazon.comWhy on earth does Amazon Canada have this HDTV for over $1000 more than the USA? What's with the price GowGing?Anyhow this is a great line of Smart TV's from Toshina. Though I am looking forward to there new refreshed HDTV's coming in 2013 from what I've found out.

When I switch to another channel, picture is great.Also have issue that shows up sometimes where I get a message that a software update is available.  If I click OK, it tells me to wait while it downloads and if I do anything, it could make the TV inoperable.... so I wait.  Then I get a message that no update is available.  A day or so later, I get the same notice about an update.  I've been saying \"no\" to the upgrade, but it is a hassle to do so as I have to use the TV remote and not the Dish remote... juggling multiple remotes to handle this one issue.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Toshiba will not turn on!", "Author": "Michael Hibbard", "ReviewID": "R1ZEMO861R26XL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "will not turn on, i've spent more time behind the tv turning it on and off and unplugging it to reset it than watching it! when it did work it looked great, trying to get money back for the tv.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,099.99", "Features": "1080p Full HD - Enjoy the highest level of HD picture quality available today.\nClearScan 240Hz - Get awesome, crisp images for quick-action sports and other fast-motion video.\n3D Capability - Enjoy games and movies in truly immersive 3D.\nSmart TV - Enhances your television experience by tying into the web, your mobile devices, even other electronics in your home to expand what you can do and enjoy.\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi - All SmartTV Models Have Built-in Wi-Fi.
