{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You won't believe what you get for your money!!!", "Author": "Eggroll", "ReviewID": "R3DI9FG02GAPIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hesitant about buying this TV but went for it anyway.  I'm glad I did.  This is my first LED TV.  I was looking to replace my big-screen projection TV, but my budget didn't allow the size I needed.  So I figured I'd settle for this one with the intention of moving it into the bedroom later on.  I didn't need all the extra connections, and definitely didn't want a 3D TV.  This model seemed to provide what I needed.  I haven't been able to check out all of the features completely, so I'll update my review later.  But for now, it really is an awesome TV.Pros:- The picture is absolutely beautiful in HD. Almost life-like. Out of the box, it wasn't great.  I had to play with the settings to get it the way I wanted it.  I found it better to turn off the Clear Motion and just run it at 120hz with no software enhancements.  I have yet to find another type of viewing that would benefit from the 240hz.  But I haven't watched football or Nascar yet :)- Full LED; EnergyStar 5.0 - bet ya can't find that in a LCD or Plasma! $12/yr avg cost of energy :) Color, contrast, sharpness, etc., the picture is just... wow! Can't tell the difference between this 4,000,000:1 vs. 5,000,000:1 ratios. Blacks are dark, whites are bright; settings to adjust that too.- Sound: WOW! I expected crappy sound from tiny speakers, but man was I wrong! The sound setup has many different options. Sound Modes include: Standard (real good stereo but no effects), Amplified (what I use, like boosted stereo), Music (greater stereo sound with added bass and crisper treble), Movie (theater sound), & Clear Voice (mono?). Other options for speakers, sound effects, etc. I can't express how impressed I am with the sound from a 1\" thick TV.- Internet Apps: Lots of choices for movies, music, social networking, etc. Basically the same ones the other mfgrs are offering. All easy to use.- Design: front panel controls are Touch sensitive, NO buttons!!! Love it! Remote: kinda large, but allows control of movies and Internet apps; intuitive, no need to read the manual.  Finish is beautiful; says it's a Rose-Black, but I don't see any color at all in it.  Looks deep black, high gloss to me.  Very thin, stand is sturdy or can mount TV panel on wall.  No connections coming out of the side of the TV (all in the back) reduces eye-sore clutter.- straightforward & intuitive; easy to work with and adjust settings. Tons of settings to tweak it just the way you want it.- when changing sources, it remembers the setting you had last with each particular mode so you don't always have to go in to change it every time.- view pics/vids from usb thumb drive / ext drive, wireless network connect to access shared media (movies, music, pics) from your computers.Cons:- No ethernet port to hard-wire. Need wifi dongle for internet apps.  On the upside, I got the Rosewill RNX-N1 dongle for $33 that works seamlessly and only costs half the price of Samsung's dongle. Software not necessary; just plug it in. I don't know if a USB Lan adapter (for ethernet port) will work with this TV; if anyone knows, please let us know :) Otherwise, the Rosewill works perfectly and all apps I've tried also work.  Rosewill gets its own review ;)- Limited connection ports: no optical for sound bar, but it's not needed anyway. Home theater can be ran through BluRay HDMI or Receiver component/composite.  Has 2 HDMI, 2 USB, 1 Component, 1 Composite, 1 mini jack.Overall, this TV was made for an excellent picture and sound with minimal fluff. And that's exactly what they achieved. Perfect for a small living room or a master bedroom. Hook up a BluRay player or laptop; that's all you really need. Just get the dongle for wifi and you're good to go! Highly recommend to anyone who's after picture/sound/price on the priority list ;)UPDATE:It's only been a few days, but I've been obsessed with playing around with all the settings! LOL So this what I've settled on for now. Understand that everyone has different preferences, so what I like is probably not what you like :)Turning OFF the Motion feature provides a crisper picture, clear defined lines, without blur.  When it's turned on, straight edges look jagged, blocked, and blurred.  I did turn it on while watching an HD football game yesterday and found that the Standard setting was better than Smooth (I turned it back off after the game was over).  It seems the more you turn it up, the blurrier it gets.  Although it may reduce and even eliminate judder, it's most definitely blurry. (Comcast Cable)For regular viewing, I use the following:Picture Mode - StandardBacklight - 14Contrast - 80Brightness - 51Auto Motion Plus - OffLED Motion Plus - OffThe different picture modes automatically change the other settings in order to \"create\" that particular mode.  It's kinda like a one-click solution for a fast setup instead of going in and changing up to 4-8 individual settings.I played around with a few other settings, but only made slight changes just to increase vibrancy/color saturation/warmth.  Like I said, you have to experiment to find what you like :)I changed the setting for DVD's to Dynamic picture mode.  Had to make some other adjustments once I did that, but I've had to tweak it for each movie I tested it on.I downloaded the AllShare software from Samsung and installed it on my desktop computer. The wifi router shows the TV on your network. I found if you place files in the program's default folders, it duplicates the files.  Much easier to just add (link) your already existing folders/locations.Hope this info helps :) Enjoy!", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just Right", "Author": "Kevin Francis McWilliams", "ReviewID": "R3UXLQ57W3W66D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv last week and I am so very pleased with it.I chose this model for several reasons but one big one is that it is NOT 3D....not falling for that fad stuff!  I also run all my things through an AV receiver...which everyone should be doing already, so I didnt care if it even had speakers built in..just gonna mute em anyway. Only need one HDMI port, everything is funneled through the receiver again.  This tv is light. I was able to replace my bulky 720p 60 pounder with this 30 or so pounder using the same wall hanging mount ...BONUS! It's so thin it's almost too close to the wall now, so awesome!You will spend a bit making sure all your tv settings are right for the style of tv you watch...fast action movies and sports vs soap operas :P But once you get it right Man o Man. What a great buy.So for those of you not wanting a 3D fad tv, not needing 8 million inputs, not needing awesome high def speakers....this is your tv!", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good and Bad", "Author": "limelight \"reachranj\"", "ReviewID": "RTRTW6RJYKK90", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good:1) Great picture, which is why I bought the TV. 240 refresh rate.Bad:1) While this is an internet connectable TV, you can ONLY do this with a wireless adapter, which you have to buy at additional cost. You cannot connect with a LAN cable as there is no LAN port on this TV. I was both surprised and disappointed with this. I bought an LG Blu-ray player, which came with a LAN port for internet apps and cost about the same as the wireless adapter for this TV.2) The remote is less than basic - you can't control your cable box or DVD player.3) Stand and overall quality/finish of the TV is not great. Even the screws to assemble to the stand were machined poorly and don't fit well. Stand does not rotate.4) Very limited Inputs and Outputs!Samsung really stripped everything out of this TV. They should have left the smart TV out as well and lowered the price point further. It doesn't feel like a high-end product at all, which is a shame because it could be a fantastic looking set if the finish were slightly better.I replaced a Toshiba TV with this one and that had many more bells and whistles for a similar price. LG have a 47\" at a similar price point, which also seems to have many more features.Perhaps Samsung can ship everyone a better stand, wireless dongle and a better remote all for free!Will likely return this set and buy another one.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV! Exactly what I needed.", "Author": "Clow Angel \"my thoughts, my memories.\"", "ReviewID": "R4KAUQTO161T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV at Best Buy on Black Friday, and it's been a great investment so far. Right put of the box, it was beautiful: glossy, black, and thin. In my opinion, the quality's great. I made sure to check it over as I was setting it up.First things first, this TV came \"Smart TV READY\" meaning, it is capable of using wifi but doesn't have the adapter. It's really weird, I know, but that's what it means. So for those complaining about how it doesn't come with an adapter, well, you have to understand it has already warned you. You simply didn't understand the technical babble. If you're looking for a TV that comes with usable wifi, look for TVs that SAY 'wireless adapter included' or something similar.PROS:~ Picture. It has a Gorgeous--yes, capital G--display. Yes, it took some tweaking to get it just the way I want it, but it wasn't a difficult thing to do. A few adjustments here and there took only a few minutes. It also has a 240 refresh rate! I game a lot, and the amazing refresh rate makes everything look super smooth. I actually just set it to 120 for some of my less action-intense games, and it is absolutely breath-taking.~ Sound. Yeah, it isn't surround sound, but it sounds a lot better than most TVs I've seen.~ Easy set up. Seriously. This thing is LIGHT! I could pick it up with one arm. The stand and screws in my set fit perfectly. I know someone mentioned that theirs was a pretty bad fit. All I know is mine was more than just fine.~ Energy Saver! An average of $12 a year is phenomenal!CONS:~ It doesn't have many inputs and outputs, but that's not even a big deal. I have an input/output hub station thing for my entire entertainment system. I suggest people invest in one nowadays because no matter how many inputs and outputs your TV has, it's likely not enough for your entire entertainment system anyway! 5.1 surround sound, a couple of game systems, a laptop/desktop, your BluRay and/or DVD players, etc.. Not many TVs can fit all of that. And I'm sure many techies like me have even more crap they plug into their TVs.~ The remote. Yeah, it's absolutely SILLY, but the remote's really clunky and ugly. It's also pretty basic as someone else mentioned. It, however, CAN control your Samsung DVD player.As I play around with my TV more, I'll update this review if I find I have more things to add.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is a great value for the feature set.", "Author": "Francis D. Ferrall \"Delphititan\"", "ReviewID": "R3ATYB2H1Z4FQF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife and I bought this set after seeing a special promotion by Samsung. It arrived from Amazon quickly and was easy to set up. The contrast is simply amazing compared to older TVs we have owned. We bought the USB network adapter. The WiFi capabilities add a lot to the practical use for using the  online experience if you haves group of people together and want to share the fun. I wasn't aware of what Samsung's \"Smart TV\" was all about, but it turns out to a be well implemented set of apps to access and use theinternet.I would recommend this set to anyone who is not wanting 3D as one of the features in their new TV. The lack of 3D is the only reason I gave a \"4\"rating.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money!", "Author": "Josh m.", "ReviewID": "R3RK4HFEQ698HD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was hesitant about buying a \"Used-Good\" TV from amazon, but for the price of 514$/free shipping how could I lose? The shipping was a week by UPS. I was surprised to see it in the original box. First thing I did was inspect the tv and could not see the \"cosmetic imperfections\" that where stated on the description. Maybe they use a magnifying lens to see or I'm just not that picky. Even my girlfriend was like \"you bought this used? Looks new.\" Second thing I did was plug it in..BAM.. POWERS ON! I popped in \"Planet Earth\" on blu-ray and enjoyed full HD 1080p! =0. I could not believe that I got this tv for such a great price! This is a wi-fi only \"Smart tv\" but my blu-ray player and apple tv are smarter than this TV.. pttth! I already own a 50\" sammy plasma (GREAT!) and a 32\" LCD (ok). This is my first  'edge-lit LED/LCD' and Im a bit disappointed that the corners are a bit brighter in darkest of scenes (cowboys and aliens, dark knight). My Plasma does not have this issue. Thats why I give the TV 4 stars instead of 5. (I give amazon 5/5) I think its the technology really. Full array/ Local dimming LEDs would not have this issue.Ok here are a few things I noticed about all three TV technologies (LED, LCD, Plasma). The lighting is only PART of the TV. Some people love Plasmas; others are diehard LED fans. Whatever. If the company is reputable with quality components and video processors, the tv is going to look GREAT no matter what lighting style you choose. LED is expensive, thin and bright but its darks are not the best. Plasma is cheaper with great blacks/natural color but the glass panel is reflective and can break. LCD's are durable and have darker blacks than edge-lit LEDs but not the level of plasma. IF you are going to choose a tv, remember that all three styles can produce a crystal clear picture. What you are paying for is the backlighting technology.Another thing is 720p vs 1080p;I have both. I own a newer 50\" Samsung 720p plasma ($550) and this 46\" 1080p Edge-lit LED/LCD ($514).-(Blu-rays)10Ft away = Both have same great picture.5ft away= 1080p still great picture, 720p begins to look grainy. (1080p looks grainy at 2ft away.)-(HD CABLE)10ft away= Both look the same (great)5ft away= Both begin to look grainy", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "WHAT A DEAL!", "Author": "DAN", "ReviewID": "R3R9IPKDAR48KE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so happy with this TV! The set up was child's play, and I had it up and running in less than 1/2 hour. WOW! The picture is amazing! I am replacing a ten year old Samsung HDTV (one with picture tube, monster weighs about 150 lbs!) I thought it had a great picture! But this new one is light years ahead of it! Yes, it only has two HDMI inputs, but that's perfect for me (cable and blueray)I had to buy a couple of cables, but found them on Amazon dirt cheap as well! Besides it does have a component input that would handle something else.The first thing I watched was TRON Legacy running through my sound system while playing the BlueRay! Really it looked better and sounded better than in the theatre! It was so crisp and clear, it made me a little dizzy! I simply wasn't used to seeing so much detail. I looked at hundreds(literally, at big box stores and local businesses)of TV's and Samsung came up on top for picture clarity and depth. When I saw the deal Amazon had on this set I jumped at it! No tax, free shipping, and I received it in less than a week! What more could you ask for?

It was due to be delivered on 12-9. Shipping was delayed by adverse weather and unit didn't arrive until 12-12 , a Monday. Tracking on the shipment left a lot to desired. UPS tracking seemed to be a few hours behind where the set actually was at all times. We waited  all day assuming that a purchase that cost this much would probably require a signature. We finally left at 6:00 pm figuring they had missed us. Unit was left on side porch without checking to see if we were home. It would have been easy for a passerby to give themselves a free Christmas present.Because of late arrival, didn't assemble unit until Tuesday. Unit requires 8 srews ( 2 sets of 4) to attach stand to the TV. Unit was missing 4 screws. Tried Lowe's and Home Depot to replace. No luck. Called Samsung's 800 service number. You would have thought I was asking for a new set. I asked the service rep to send all 8 screws since I didn't know which four were missing. He asked for everything but my shoe size and birth certificate, constantly putting me on hold for five or more minutes at a time. He finally agreed to send the screws in 3 to 5 busines days. The set could not be usd without these 4 lousy screws. I thought I talked him into overnighting the screws because he did say he would do that.Meanwhile I found a local company that dealt in hard to find screws and was able to find four that matched the missing ones. If you buy this set don't count on service for Samsung. Today is the 15th and still no replacement screws from them. So much for overnighting them. Set still wouldn't be running if I had waited for them. Because of this I plan to buy an extended warranty from someone else.Finally assembled the set. When you have all the parts the setup is easy. Obviously haven't had the set long but the picture is great. We checked in local stores before buying and liked the Samsung's picture best. There are some things I wished I had noticed before buying this set. This is a smart tv that is able to access the internet. However It doesn't come with an ethernet connection and the wireless LAN connector wasn't cheap. It has only two HDMI connections. I used 1 for my cable box and one for my DVD player. I hope I don't need to connect anything else. The set improves the quality of standard channels but it really sings in HD. I like the high def so much I sprang for an extra $5 a month on my cable to get the HD channels.It took quite awhile to download all the software for the smart tv but after that evcerything worked great. I gave it 3 stars mostly because of poor srevive from Samsung and the lack of sufficient connectors. If this is not a problem for you, this is a great set for the price, although I would suggest you consider a service contract from someone other than Samsung. If I keep getting the picture quality I am getting now, I'll have no regrets.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good Deal", "Author": "gsigley", "ReviewID": "R1ZTLYACFWGA79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this tv for bedroom.

Trimble", "ReviewID": "RTYVT8JXH5464", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is based on my experience watching American Football, and my run-in with Samsung supportI watch football over the air antenna from local broadcast towers.  With the default settings, I found the artifacting moderate on close-ups.  I fixed this by dropping the judder and blur controls from 5 to 2 (turning them up only increased the artifacting.)  The only sacrifice I've seen is when a scrimmage happens and someone goes into movement, there's a bit of a \"claymation\" movement effect on the player in motion occasionally.  I suspect this has to do with the video processor's logic in handling portions of the screen where there is no active movement for <x> amount of time.  It probably prioritizes updating cells on the TV that have had movement recently.  It's not too distracting, though.  I might be able to tune my settings in better to eliminate it, but haven't figured it out yet.  Once the play is in motion, the TV keeps up to produce a flawless display of the action, so it's only a very minor thing that you \"notice\" , but doesn't distract from why you're watching the game.SAMSUNG Support:My TV was shipped without the \"guide stand\" which is the bracket that connects the TV to the stand.  I eventually got through to Samsung's \"executive escalations\" support, where I was told that my piece would be \"expedited\" to me.  They wouldn't confirm what the shipping would be, though (serious minus points here against Samsung.)  NOTE:  You have to send in proof of purchase to get a part shipped, and the people who review your submission of invoice aren't available through Samsung's support over the phone (different dept existing state-side.)  You have to wait for them to contact you.  I received a call within 24 hours confirming what I submitted was sufficient, but I was also already speaking to frontline support's managers at this point; might have had an impact.  You definitely have to push multiple times to get up the support levels at Samsung, and even when you do, they can't confirm how long it's going to take to get you your part.  The ballpark quoted before I got \"expedited\" shipping was 5-14 days (which, frankly, is unacceptable for a screw-up on their end.)To Samsung's credit, their chat support is easily accessible, as is their phone support.  I didn't have to wait for a rep, and their phone-tree doesn't prompt one to stab things.Great TV, and good luck dealing with Samsung if you have to.EDIT:  Turn judder up to 10 and keep blur at 2.

Up to that time I had been perfectly content with a 40\" Samsung LCD HDTV (1080p) and friends told me there was little difference with the new LED screens.  But then I actually saw the new Samsung LED in person at a local store.  BOY WHERE MY FRIENDS WRONG! So I not only stepped up to LED, but increased my picture size to 46\" and can now reliably state that LED is THE way to go ... and Samsung remains my favorite HDTV manufacturer ... while AMAZON remains the only place where I buy my electronics.  If there is a single drawback in the Samsung, it remains the tiny, tinny 10-watt built-in sound system.  You really need to augment their sound to get the full experience.

It's like using an IBM and trying to sign onto AOL...at 5:30pm. Catch my drift? I almost thought about paying someone to just take it....However, for my purposes, this tv was the most cost effective buy I found, so I sucked it up, and kept trying. I went out and bought a Vizio Blueray, I needed a DVD player anyway, and the Vizio had a larger wi-fi pick up antenna attached. I by-passed the tv's dongle, and streamed Netflix via the Vizio....and when it works? It's freaking amazing, but when it doesn't, it really doesn't.... And it doesn't often....Still, I kept playing. I'm really not one of those people that like adjusting settings to get the picture I like with every use... I'll do it once and it better make everything look great from that point forward. I guess I really lucked out with my Sharp Aquos 26\" LCD from like 5 years ago, because the picture was amazing, is amazing, no matter what's playing. And, neither is it contingent on the program running at HDMI, simple analog tv looks great on my sharp. Not so for this Samsung. HDMI programs that work, look beautiful, but a low res streaming program....forrrrrgggggeeeeetttttt it, save and buy an aquos. Despite this, packing this back up to pay for return shipping, wasn't something I was really excited about, so I kept it.I tried one of the earlier posts recommended settings and yes, he was right on with the motion plus stuff....that blocky blurry picture was making me want to pull my hair out. So thanks!The speakers on this are fantastic....thank God. It's probably why I kept it, because, I didn't want to pay for a whole new home theatre as living in an apartment building...one needs to pay extra attention to how much noise they make, and you can practically blow my walls down, they're so thin.

The sound is good too, but it definitely helps if you have external speakers. I have connected this TV to my Logitech computer speakers using the audio 3.5\" minijack and the sound is excellent now.Definitely get the Rosewill wireless adapter for $30 or so. You can connect this TV to your wireless home network and run all the Samsung apps. The lack of an ethernet port is not a big minus in my book as I mostly use wireless networking for all devices now.I was initially using this TV as a dumb TV. It did not have a direct internet connection, but I was using my Panasonic BDT210 Bluray player to get to Netflix, Youtube etc. The Panasonic Viera Connect UI is excellent and I was quite happy. As the price of the Rosewill adapter is only $30 now, I decided to get the TV connected as well. So, I was able to compare Samsung apps with Panasonic apps. They are mostly similar, but two things stand out -* The Panasonic Youtube interface is much better than the Samsung one. You get preview screens and ability to scroll through pictures and choose the video you want to play with the Panasonic. The Samsung interface with much more primitive and difficult to use.* The killer app of the Samsung TV is the allshare application. This gives you the ability to connect the TV to your PC and stream music, videos and pictures from the PC. Allshare is a fantastic app - I am able to stream videos quickly and easily; what's more, it can play virtually any format video that I throw at it. My Panasonic bluray player also has the ability to connect to my PC, but it can only play some types of video and is relatively slower to load a video or to scroll through a directory of videos. Samsung has nailed this one.Other apps like Netflix, Cinema now etc. are more or less similar between Panasonic and Samsung. In short having connectivity for both devices is fun - each manufacturer is trying to put out more apps and you can have the best of both worlds.I think people who buy cheaper TVs based purely on hardware specs might be missing out on good software support - Samsung and Panasonic are at the top of the heap when it comes to apps and slick user interfaces.A few pointers -* Use 'makemkv' (google it) to convert DVDs and Blurays painlessly to MKV format which is now the industry standard video format for bluray players, TVs etc (almost all new players can play MKV).* The video played from the PC can be stopped/resumed. Fast forward, rewind does not work that well - you get to go a few seconds forward and back for each click, but it is better than nothing.* For streamed video, closed captions do not appear. But there is a workaround for this - you need to create a SRT file with the same name as the MKV file and store them in the same directory. Once you do that closed captions work. You can extract an SRT file from the MKV file using mkvmerge GUI app (google it), or you can download a readymade SRT file from allsubs.org.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Expected better software", "Author": "RED STICK GUY \"ReddStickGISguy\"", "ReviewID": "R1DKDK71OS5JLN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The T.V. is pretty good. you might have garnered from other reviews that the outputs and inputs on the T.V. are pretty bare bones.The picture quality is pretty awesome.

Nope.  Only the one sold by Samsung will work.
