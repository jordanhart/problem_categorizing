I bought it 6 months ago and haven't looked back since. Like I said if you're interested in this TV but still don't know, do a test drive of it and see first hand what you think,Hope I was able to clear some things up for people, Thank you!", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Deal", "Author": "Manny Lopez", "ReviewID": "R2SGW6TPAU1AH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent high-definition picture quality and it has a good wide viewing angle.  It includes 6 3D glasses and the 3D picture is very good.  The sound is also very good.  Lots of features!

StillCovered by warranty.. After 2 weeks lg finally sent someone out (the first company they were going to send out screamed at me on the phone after they didn't Show up for the service appointment).LG had another service company come and replace every circuit board in the tv and they were actually good. My question is.. What's happens when it breaks again and I am not covered????? I'm going to have to pay a bunch of money to get this TV fixed. DO NOT BUY A LG TV...BUY A SAMSUNG ..SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY. It will be well worth it. Customer service at LG is so terrible.. It is outsourced to Another country and you can not get a straight answer. PLEASE TAKE MY WORD ON THIS, DO NOT PURCHASE A LG TV! Especially this one!!!!!!!", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I would buy.", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R1WPWO9VODHR1O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far so good with this item.

I love the sharing features from my computer to TV and to be able to go to Netflix on my phone and cast directly to TV without having to change inputs or touch the remote. The Android Remote App is good and makes for a better remote in some cases Vs the Magic remote. 3D is good but we don't use it much. Has many smart applications and you can download more from LG market. Audio is ok and the only output is fiber optic which is best, if you have the cable. Picture quality is great and one of the best.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "great , in all ways, considering....", "Author": "Ichabod Mudd \"Ichabod mudd\"", "ReviewID": "RVWYPP7SBE9LJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love mine, every inch of it.It is not a home theater, or s sound surround, the 2 internal speakers are say, \"extreme low end\" but how could it not be, there is no room inside for 5.1 or real speakers.I'ts a smart TV and uploads changes all the time, so comparing it's smart streaming menus to other devices is \"anecdotal\",  just use what ever box has the best smarts for you?,, gee don't they all have it,  lets see...(smartTV,smart yamaha AVR, smart blue ray,etc...) all are a moving target \"smarts\".  just pick one this week that floats your boat... next week , that can change...The first thing to do is get a real AV Receiver and real speakers... (I promise you will never be sorry, and get a center channel and hear dialog for the first time)but...... if you do get the AV rec, the LG TV will fight you, every step of the way, here is my review on how to stop that.Some hate the magic wand, but is very handy in the streaming mode. no lie..  (it is tedious for simple tasks... ) and this wand is all you get.... so consider that....Here at the top 5 secrets for this TV.all in one, post......My LG55LM6400  used with AVR !secrets:It goes to logger heads,with my AVR(receiver){war}both think ,they are a home theaters. (ouch)the LG will get in a war with  controlling power of periferals and inputs, a double war, doom)the solution here, is to goto the \"input list\" screen, (not setups, odd that fact) at the bottom right of the screen,  are 3 click areas to select.Poweron+myapps+inputlist:  Change name:  Simplink settings:  Settopbox manipulation:First change the name , click this and pick, AVR receiver, (the LG, loves to show, my AVR names, passed thru. this solve this confusion)then set the simplink , OFFthen set the set top manipulation , click next , and on page 3 turn them all off.  this prevents the LG from playing with inputs, afterall my inputs are off  for ever and frozen at  HDMI1 (AVR)after this act, no more logger heads with my AVR. (2 days that took)but, having to click 10 buttons on 5 Remotes, is no fun at all...  so here is one more trick. the best of all...I then bought a harmoney 650,  and I now have one remote. (almost){I use the magic, when in streaming mode, too}i programmed it to watch TV, watch DVD and FM radio, and Netflix.(really NF, is the streaming page)one more odd, little secret on the LG,  this one has dual communications on the remote,  (Magic) RF comms and IR comes.the mouse like action is RF (bluetootle we think)  use for the home key too.I wanted my home key work with my harmoney 650,  (the harmoney does not do RF !)to get the home key to work, you must learn the secret command (yes, the TV actually does have a IR command for HOME but never uses it)odd huh?so the trick here is ,,,,  unlearn the remoteoff the Harmoney site, (edited by me)the fix (and tested by me)Re: LG 55LMxxx  Issues  (run off a non RF harmoney)OptionsAll my harmony buttons work with the LG but the  home key, the arrow keys work for mouse ARROW siumulation, just fine.Solution:As soon as you pair your remote with your TV, some of the commands cease being sent out via Infrared. (like HOME)You can \"Un pair\" your remote by holding down the Home and Back Buttons at the same time  for about 5 seconds.the Back and Home are side by side on the magic wand.You know your remote is not paired when the cursor, does not appear on screen ,when you shake the remote.After un Pairing the remote,Teach your Harmony remote the IR command in the way described in the manual.(it's easy, the harmoney has an optical learn port, press Learn, save. (i did not use RAW mode) The LCD on the Harm. will say received input... (then save)Test your new command. (HOME) Mine shows in the Harmoney, remote LCD \"as Netflix\" which really is just streaming mode, with 1 click.I also assigned the new home to the unused red HARM. button.Once you're able to reach the home page using your Harmony remote,you can again re-pair the magic remote (push the center OK Wheel) and now BOTH remotes will work.this pairing step is very easy.happy trails.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "used unit not good", "Author": "btownguy", "ReviewID": "RFO9Y8E70W5S0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the tv seems fine but then again this is my first hd tv. 3d tv was supposed to come with 6 3d glasses but only 5 were in the shipment and a few of them where not even in sealed packages so i'm not to pleased  and this with other recent purchases on amazon  Im not happy with the shipping and return policy.
