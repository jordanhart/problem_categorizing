It is also incredibly thin, which is great for the wall mounted installation.I purchased a pair of Sharp 3D glasses on ebay.I have the TV hooked up to a HTPC with a GT430 video card . I watched \"Resident evil afterlife\" 3D Blu-ray. It was breathtaking.I did not test the OTA HDTV tuner as I don't have an antenna hookup in the room where the TV is at the moment.I have not tried the DLNA feature either.Pros :The picture is very bright and just amazing. Much better than other manufacturers like Sony and Vizio.This is a really nice size for a large roomWhen watching 1080p/60Hz sources, the picture is incredibly smooth. The 240 Hz refresh rate is absolutely amazing. I may have to watch this TV more even though the screen is only 1/4\" of the size of my projection screen.The wifi really works well. I have it working with wireless N on the 5 GHz band connected to a Cisco E3000 router about 50ft away. I can stream movies/previews from Vudu at the maximum quality, over 9 Mbit/s sustained. This may seem little compared to the 300 Mbit/s theoretical of wireless N, but it is actually impressive that there are no dropouts.The price was excellent. It was the same as the 832 model at Costco which is not 3D. I see that it has now gone up by over $500 since I purchased it.It has a lot of inputs - 4 HDMI, 1 component, 1 VGACons :3D picture is dimmer than 2D. And you can't watch the picture lying down with the 3D glasses, the polarization dims the picture too much.The built-in sound is weak. But that's expected on all TVs. You just have to pair the TV with a separate audio system.I couldn't get the HDMI Audio Return Channel feature to work with the Onkyo HT-S5300 HTIB. It could be due to the receiver and not the TV, though the TV manual says this feature only works with other Sharp Aquoslink equipment.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "Buzznut3000", "ReviewID": "R2YCDF7FXESHS9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazing is the only word to describe this TV.  The bezel is small and the stand is rock solid, it looks great even when off.  When you turn it on your jaw drops at the bright, colorful, razor sharp picture.  This TV has just about every feature you can imagine.  How cool is it to effortlessly switch from TV to Netflix to stored files.  I have not tried the 3D yet so hopefully that will not disappoint.  Only a few minor issues keep this from being 5 stars.Pros:-Dual band wireless N-2 USB data ports, this TV plays avi, mkv flawlewssly with a nice user interface.  Great to have one large drive connected and still have a port to plug in my portable drive.-You can turn off the 'TV ON' light in the front.  May not seem like a big deal but with this off there are no lights or indicators to distract you.-Nice Netflix UI, better than the xbox IMO-Ridiculous number of connections, all my old (and new) stuff connects with no problem.Cons:-The remote is not the best, it works but sometimes you have to point it directly at the TV.  Also it doesn't light up.  I suppose there has to be some corners cut to get a 60\" set at this low price.-I could only get 1 bar on the wireless from my brand new Netgear Dual band router 25 ft away.  I had set up a dedicated 5GHz network for this TV but I eventually decided to have the cable company come out and throw a drop in behind the TV.  Maybe a 2.4GHz connection would work better.-Netflix software is a little buggy.  It kept locking up when using the wireless.  Wired connection solved it for me.  Sharp is working on it and has already issued 2 updates.  Not a deal breaker but something to keep in mind.-When viewing files on a USB drive you have to bring up an onscreen menu to stop, pause, etc.  Not a big deal but the remote already has these buttons (which work for Netflix), why not use these?Overall this is a great TV.  With all these built in features it is not surprising that there are a few minor bugs to work out.  Don't let those stop you from getting one of these great sets.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality at a great price per inch.", "Author": "AZ Mutley", "ReviewID": "R1P97ZKZPJ3QY6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this unit a week now and I'm very impressed with it. The picture quality is amazing.I use it with an Oppo 93 3D Bluray player going through an Onkyo 970. Everything is HDMI 1.4compliant and it all works very nicely together. The Sharp sees the Onkyo, but not the Opposo far. Not really an issue. Likewise the limited web apps are not somethig that bother me.3D playback was out of this world watching Avatar. I had seen 3D demos in stores and thought it wasa bit contrived and not really immersive. I'd see some cartoon character pop out of the screen, or abig drop of water go by rafting the grand canyon.. but Avatar was full on, very real.. as far as itis \"real\" of course.Be prepared to mess about for a while dialing in the picture. Skin looked overly red out of the box.I also had to tone down yellow and magenta setting and reduce color saturation a few clicks in orderto make things right (for me).It's been pointed out to me from my review of a previous Samsung 3D TV that the yellow pixel is a gimmick, and yes, it is,as the industry spec color to be divided into Red Green Blue..but I think Sharp actually did something clever. Since the numberof pixels is limited to 1920 by 1080, the bigger a screen gets the bigger the pixels, or the wider the gap between them.. so byadding the 4th yellow pixel Sharp are filling the \"holes\" and adding resolution, as it were. It might boost total output too..which is why I needed to dial it all down out of the box. Food for thought.Pros: 60\" 3D LCD for 2300$, wow! Great picture. Huge number of adjustments. Usable on board speakers for once.Awesome 3D with Avatar. Slim , great for wall mount (when I get around to it) Nice \"hidden\" buttons on the bottom right allow use even when remote is lost. Power saving modes.(slight) Cons: ugly base, remote is a bit direction sensitive, only a couple of apps (which I don't use) huge number of adjustments :)  There is a slight amount of light leak in the corners, but it's dark rather than bright and I notice it only on fully \"on\" shots, such as a white title page. I've seen much worse than this so it's a negligible con.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for Gaming!", "Author": "Bhendro", "ReviewID": "R1RQN3MX3YWUL5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I play a lot of online multiplayer games that require fast reflexes such as Tekken 6, Super Street Fighter 4 and Killzone 3, so game input lag is a huge deal for me. It can make or break any gamer. I was tempted to buy Samsung D8000 55-inch until I found that it has game lag of 66ms or 4 full frames/second. Simply unacceptable!So on to this TV:When gaming, make sure to change the AV Mode to \"GAME\" for optimal no-lag experience!  Now, the \"GAME\" mode is not the prettiest one, but I managed to calibrate it so well that it looks even better than the best mode \"Dynamic (FIXED)\". I pulled some chained combos on SSF4 and Tekken 6 and they came out perfect without noticeable lag!The TV's overall picture quality is great, but not as good as Samsung D8000. If you spend some fine-tuning on the display calibration, though, it can come pretty close :)BTW, the TV MUST be calibrated out-of-the-box. Don't be surprised when the picture doesn't look as good as you thought it should when you first got it. That's just the default factory setting.Its speakers quality is the best I've heard out of flat panel TVs in a long time. The woofer really adds the \"umph\" in bass department, especially during gunfight scenes.It's also one of the greenest TV out there. With advanced mode, you can tone down the watt-consumption down to 97 Watts. It's pretty neat for my electric bill. But note that if you calibrate the TV that makes it require more brightness, the Wattage will go up. But that's pretty much the norm of all TVs out there.The movie looks great. Played some footage of OceanEleven and it looks so vivid and clear. Make sure to turn off the smooth-film mode to restore it back to 24frames/second. Yeah, I'm not into that \"soap-opera\" look that new TVs are promoting these days.Haven't use the 3D feature yet. I don't have the glasses yet (it's not included with the TV).The apps are okay but I don't use them as much except Netflix. It's really sluggish to browse around Netflix, but once it streams the movie it's very smooth without pause or interruption. Note that it also depends on your internet connection and how you connect to it. My internet is adequate speed and I connect it straight via ethernet cable. I haven't tried it via WiFi yet, so I couldn't tell.However, PS3 streams Netflix better than this TV. It has somewhat better color and hue along with less artifacts during fast-motion scenes.If you're a gamer, I highly recommend this TV. For 60-inch 3D TV, it's the best bang for the buck!PS. Current calibration setting for Game/Viper Mode based on Disney WOW disc (note that your preference may vary):Backlight: +16Contrast: +32Brightness: +2Color: +8Tint: 0Sharpness: +3Haven't played with the hue settings yet.If you watch Bluray movies/Netflix online streaming, use \"Dynamic Mode\" instead. Here's my Dynamic Mode calibration setting (feel free to adjust it to your liking):Backlight: +16Contrast: +26Brightness: +1Color: +1Tint: 0Sharpness: +2Advanced Setting (Dynamic Mode):Motion Enhancement: 120Hz HighQuad Pixel Plus: OnActive Contrast: OffGamma Adjustment: 0Film Mode: Off (IMPORTANT.

I am upgrading from a 52\" Samsung so my expectations were high. This tv has it all; wireless, apps, decent sound, slim design, and breathtaking picture quality.I have a Panasonic BDT-110 3D Blu ray player and 2.0 stereo hooked up to it, not to mention a few game consoles. I use the stereo combined with the tv speakers and I get good sound that is just right for me(I'm not a big fan of surround).3D playback was amazing. I started with IMAX Under the Sea and was mesmerized. I grabbed Despicable Me, Avatar(which came free with my Panny Blu Ray Player by mail in), and Tron Legacy. All of them are amazing. The pop-out, depth, and brilliant colors are awe inspiring. The only con to the 3D is the large clunky glasses. One good point about the sharp glasses is you can double click the power button while watching to switch from 3D to 2D without turning the 3D off for everyone.I mainly use the netflix app since I don't have cable tv. The wireless is buggy as people have pointed out. I plan on hard wiring it soon so hopefully that will eliminate my problems. For now, I have found the best thing to do is when you first turn the tv on, wait a few minutes for it to \"connect\" to the wireless(I guess that's what its doing) before you try to use it in any way, netflix, vudu, etc. Sometimes you may still get a unable to connect screen. Dunno what the problem is, got wireless on everything else but the tv... I do know that all the apps won't work, not just one and if you go to the wireless setup, it will show that it is connected. C'mon Sharp...Now for the reason I wrote this review, the picture. It is nothing short of amazing; once you get it dialed in. This can be pretty tricky, it took me weeks to get it right. I am one of those guys who wants the picture to look the same all the time, I don't want to switch to movie mode, then to game mode, then to regular tv mode... I do enough remote clicking as it is. I read every online tv spec guide, looked at others setups, and even downloaded a few calibration dvds to try to get it right.

As I stood in HH Greg, I looked at all the LEDs that were close to this one(Samsung, LG, Sony). They were all 55\" and this was a 60\" and the Sharp had better brighter and more color depth than those tvs. I have played my PS3 on this tv and the picture was amazing even 3d gameplay like Socom Navy Seals, MLB 2011...WOW!!AWESOME. Blu rays and 3d movies were really nice to watch too.  On 3d, you may expirience a little ghosting at times or cross talk, but this is minamle. Its so infrequent that its not a big deal as I heard other tvs are worse and pretty much all tvs need to work on this issue.I do expirience on fully white or or light colored pictures that there appears really small black spots in all 4 corners of the tv....I feel this is caused by the led edge lighting of the tv.....like I said a small issue and very hard to see....I am really picky though.I have a 40\" Samsung LCD and a Samsung 42 \" plasma and I feel those are all great tvs too, but this Sharp Quattron 3d tv is by far better!!  The remote is nice but could have had better button placement and could have come with lighted buttons. Overall though nice remote.I have not used the apps and pretty much are worthless unless you have internet. The frame is stylish and nice.  If wall mounted....the tv's hdmi ports are still easily accessed on the left side....most tv's plug straight into the back, while these plug in kinda sideways which makes it easier to plug in.I installed and hung this tv by myself( I am a bigger guy) so keep in mind I recomend 2 people for an easier install.Overall the tv is great, but I feel the tv needs to be calibrated better towards THX certification.....Understand this is not a THX certified tv, but would be better if it was....All tv companies need to better calibrate these tv's if they even do that at all.Pros- I use the user setting for the most accurate colors and brightness and black levels.  Tv has one of best picutres I have seen.  Vivid blues, greens and yellows(all colors really)  Many options for apps  Great price  $1925.00 plus tax HH Gregg  Great clear 3d picture  I Still think yellow pixels make a difference( as to some people don't)  Power saver, when you forget to turn off tv, will power itself down when no signal is detected...nice feature!  Automatic brightness control to adjust with amount of light that comes through winows or lamps.  Sensor on tv....no need for a seperate sensor.Cons- Glasses not included.  Remote's buttons are somewhat small and need to be back lit  Some ghosting or cross talk on 3d....but not really noticable.  Menu sometimes annoying but overall easy to use.I purchased this tv at HH Gregg for $1925.00 plus tax.  Glasses not included I spent $80 a piece a HH Gregg.  Amazon had them a bit cheaper at $73.00 plus ship.I really tried to give as many cons but there are not much......You should enjoy this tv and I would recomend this over others....not just because of the cost but the cost for the picture quality you receive.OVERALL- Great tv for the buck.......as time goes on I will update on any possible problems I may encounter.....Thanks!

Also remember that most of the Apps are sort of hidden within the Vudu application and all work well.When you call Sharp Customer Service they tell you they don't have any matte screens.

I had trusted Sony and did not really want to switch models until I came across this Sharp HDTV. The TV arrived in perfect condition although took a little longer that I thought. Amazon uses 'Home Direct' to ship and apparently in my town, they come once a week. The set up was pretty simple although I had to re-program my DirecTV remote, since it could not detect the new TV. The picture quality is astonishing even on non-HD channels, is so hard to tell the difference. The size and at the same time, the thinness of the TV blew my mind. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a 60-in TV for such a price. With decent credit, Amazon 2-yr no interest on their card was hard to pass. I did not have to have $2000 plus taken out of my savings at once. Although, it did take me a while to really convince myself to do it, since obviously no one likes debt. Without a doubt, this is a nice TV and thus far, no regrets on my purchase. For now though, I still have the box in my garage, just to be on the safe side..which in my mind, its very unlikely. By the way, a correction on Amazon's specs about this TV. The contrast ratio is 8,000,000:1 and not 800,000:1 as they state. Also, sharpusa.com states there is a firmware download to enhance 3D picture among other improvements on their website.

The settings are all-inclusive, so you can adjust everything exactly to your liking.  When I first powered it on it came up in 'Standard' mode, which was very dim, even with the amount of light I had in the room.  I adjusted it to 'Dynamic' and customized some of the settings, like the lower range of APC and it's amazing!I configured the wi-fi with no problem so it could get updates, but I don't use the apps, as their VERY limited.  My sony blu-ray has so many more so I use it instead.The TV is incredibly thin and looks great on my wall, using my low-profile Sanus mount.The TV was a great deal from Amazon, which included 2 pairs of the 3-D glasses.  I really don't care much about the 3-D, but at least it has it so I can grow into it.  My blu-ray is 3-D, so maybe I'll purchase a 3-D movie and try it out one day.The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is that the backlighting does not light the screen evenly.  This is not normally noticeable, unless it is displaying a screen with all one light color, especially white.  I contacted Sharp about it and sent photos and they said this is within specification, so there is nothing wrong with it.  I agreed that it didn't appear to be a defect, but merely how it's designed.  They said the differences in brightness are due to the edge-lit pannel.  My girlfriend got the 46\" model of the same TV and it doesn't have this problem, but I suspect that's because it's a smaller screen and the light isn't having to spread out and cover as much area.  I think the 60\" model could have used more backlights, placed closer together to cover more evenly.

Gregg. Not very knowledgeable sales staff but talked them down to a great price. Took it home attached the stand and plugged it in with no trouble. I don't agree with the main review about the stand being wobbly. We purchased a Samsung 59\" Plasma the night before that we ended up returning and its stand was definitely wobbly. The Sharps stand in comparison is solid as a rock. Review is spot on about the menu. Easy to navigate but clunky. The apps menu is great and the favorites button works well. I do wish they had included an internet browser as one of the apps or some additional apps like YouTube, Blockbuster and Hulu but I have a PS3 connected that can provide those features. Who knows Sharp might include that functionality in future upgrades. The Wi-Fi connectivity is AWESOME. Very easy to setup and very fast even with my old B router. The only complaint I have with the set is when watching normal TV that is not HD. When your doing this your going to see a fair amount of cotton balls in the black areas of the picture. Solution don't watch regular TV! Honestly though, I have owned a lot of TVs in my 49 years and this one is hands down the best TV I have ever owned. Have watched Avatar, Star Trek, Ironman & Transformers all in Blu-Ray as well as Alice in Wonderland on Netflix and the picture is STUNNING.

However, if you want a reputable manufacturer with a good history that is still making quality TVs that is a good value with a good picture, this is your TV.  The built in apps are great so I don't have to rely on external devices to connect to services such as vudu or flickr.  I would have liked more apps but vudu does a good job of connecting to these other services (such as flickr, which the TV doesn't directly do but is supported through the vudu app).  It is convenient that the TV supports automatic checking for firmware updates (it goes online and checks for you) but it was a major annoyance when it kept popping up a notification box that covered the shows I'd watch to notify me of a new update.  The update would fail EVERY time I tried it, most likely because everyone's TVs were no doubt delivering the same message to them and everyone would try to connect to the service at once.  It would run for a good 15-30 minutes and fail in the middle.  So, I would lose the use of the TV while it would try to upgrade plus I would continually get nagged with the popup.  I went online to see if I could download it and use the USB connector to update it but they had not made the update available online!!! It was very frustrating.  The way I fixed it was to try the update late at night while evryone sleeps so nobody else was connected.  Nevertheless, the TV looks nice (you have to play with the settings out of the box) and has lots of features.  I like how it can connect to DLNA servers (which I use software from Elegato to stream movies, pictures, and music from my macbook to my TV).  I also like how it supports USB drives and plays lots of different formats which I used with my WD HDTV in the past (including Divx AVI and MKV files).  The problem with the USB connections, however, is that it is in the back of the TV which means you need rear access if you're going to use a usb stick and plug in/remove (to add more movies).  That feature seems like it wasn't well thought through.  The other issue I have is the plug.  It has those standard 3-prong plugs but, when you have a super flat TV that you plan on hanging (especially with the \"picture hanging\"-type wall mounts (I used the VideoSecu Ultra Slim Thin Flat LED HDTV Fashion TV Wall Mount even though it sys it is for TVs up to 55 inches only), the plug sticks out and forces the TV away from the wall.

I have read every review available on this model and I will say that if anything that is said negative about this TV is just nit-picking about minor items. I have my PS3 connected by a type 2 HDMI and the Blu-Ray picture is pure exillerating. I have it on Dynamic(fixed) for picture and audio settings and if there is anything I find slightly negative about this SHARP HDTV is when it goes to a white screen while my daughter is playing her \"little big planet\" is that it is so bright that it could possibly tan my cat. I've noticed a very slight blur and it is quite small that I have to really look for it and I always do not see any. There are no \"Blooming\" or \"Clouding\" or even light escaping from any edges or corners. The screen is matte and there are no reflections on the screen. There are slight reflections only when in direct contact from the light source. I believe that anyone who says a fourth pixel isn't noticeable or required is working for another HDTV manufacturer. I have never seen the vivid colors on any TV as I have with this one. The yellow, golds, browns, and the blues,light blue and magentas and purples are well heck even the greens are phenominal. Well ok I can say that the \"4th\" pixel is required for these stunning colors. I'm sure SHARP has a patent on this and the other manufacturers and Critics downplay this every time to sell their less performing HDTV\"S. Audio is great on this and surround sound is not really required to get full enjoyment from the viewing experience, but i'm sure a 5.1 or even a 7.1 systen would blow me away if I also had that. The 3D effect is fairly well on this 60\" but I think that 60 inches is still a bit small to enjoy the 3D effect. It does work well, but the glasses annoy me after a period of time and even at 60\" is still small. I bought from AMAZON at 1,914.00 with a 3D bundle. (which is 2 3D glasses) I got it with no taxes and free shipping delivered to my house in a week from \"Pilot\" shipping. The box arrived undamaged and in a non confrontational manner into my living room. It was a little tricky setting it up by myself and I reccommend that you should have assistance while setting up the stand and positioning it. The most difficult aspect was getting my PS3 and my SHARP to work together. I very much reccommend going to youtube to find out any set up problems that you may encounter. After I viewed youtube about getting my HDTV to recognize my HDMI and within minutes I was viewing my Blu-Ray.The system requirements for performance is a Blu-Ray,HD cable box from satellite or cable,Type 2 HDMI cable I recommend the mediabridge offered by AMAZON. (it's very high quality at an affordable price).Anything less takes away from the performance of this high performance set, even NetFlix instant streaming was pixeled at times and non-stellar most of the time. I'm about to watch a non Blu-Ray in my PS3 to see if that views well......", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome!

It arrived earlier than expected and when it did arrive, I was contacted and asked when would be a good time to have it delivered AND set up.  Free delivery and free set up.  It was unpacked, the cables were connected, the TV was checked to make sure everything worked, then I was given a lesson on how to use it all.  Afterwards, the technician picked up all the trash and only left the box in the unlikely event it should need to be returned.  Great service.  As good as this television is, it is best to view it straight on, or no more than at 45 degrees otherwise it begins to look greyish.  The colors are brilliant and so very crisp.  Don't know if the yellow really does enhance this TV, but I can tell you it looks much better than my other HDTV.  It is not LED however.  The sound leaves something to be desired, but nothing a good sound system can't handle.  As for the 3D experience, too me it is out of this world.  Better than what you see at the movies.  Wayyyy better.***  A problem I had and this has nothing to do with Paul's TV, is that Amazon offers a 3D bundle.  When you buy this TV, you get two free pairs of 3D glasses.  I bought two extra expecting to get a total of four.  Each currently costs $71.69.  When I only received the two I had paid for, I called Amazon about the free pair and I was told that in order to get that pair, I had to buy the TV from Amazon and not a secondary seller who sells through Amazon.  Got it?  Translation...READ THE FINE PRINT! (And after you read the fine print, read it again.  Confusing huh?  I did get a $30.00 voucher from Amazon for this oversight, but I think it needs to be made more clear so that others do not make the same mistake.  Perhaps Paul's TV can do something similar and offer free glasses too.  On the other hand, I'm not sure if Amazon would have set up the television like Paul's TV did, or just have rung the doorbell and left it there leaving me to take care of the rest.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this TV", "Author": "Jonathan McCormick", "ReviewID": "R1M10V7ECXV05T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Bright, vivid picture quality.Handles fast moving picture better than comparable models.3D is amazing.Large Screen size for the moneyGood sound for a flat panel.Cons:\"Flashlighting\"Viewing Angle issuesGlossy ScreenI'm not afraid to say that I got an absolute steal on this TV. Through price matching I got it at a storefront for $1750 INCLUDING a 3d blu-ray player and 2 pairs of Sharp's Active 3D glasses. I originally went into the store to see the Samsung UN60D6400 in person, but was quickly turned off by how poorly it handled the football game being played by the store. Motion blur all over the place. Both of the TVs next to it (Samsung Un60d7000 and the Sharp LC60le835u) handled it considerably better, with a noticeable edge actually going to the sharp. In fact, I didn't notice any of that pixelated look at all, even with the poor feed that stores display their units on. Factor in the price difference, and it became a no-brainer that the Sharp was the TV for me.I did not purchase this TV specifically for the 3D capabilities, but since I got the deal that I got I picked up The Lion King 3D bluray and I am completely blown away by its ability. One complaint that I've read all over the internet is that the 3D cheapens and darkens the image on the screen. This TV, even directly out of the box, has a much brighter display- so the dimming caused by the 3D makes it on par about with what most TVs look like in standard mode. I love how bright and vibrant the TV looks, even directly out of the box. It even handles the blacks extremely well. I've become a 3D fan, simply because of how well this TV displays those images. Also, most flat panels produce VERY poor sound quality. You can actually get away with just using the factory speakers on this TV and it even provides a little 'punch' to the movies. I highly recommend getting a surround sound system if you are investing this kind of money into a TV, but you will do alright with just the regular speakers.I wish I could give this TV a 5-star, because I adore it, and I would have bought the same deal over again 100 times out of 100; however I do want to make sure people are aware of a couple issues. Whenever I first put in a blu-ray, there is definite \"flashlight\" effect where certain spots of the TV with no image show brighter than other spots of the tv. I will qualify that by saying that I have watched some dark movies and paused on the blackest scenes possible, and when it is actually displaying an image I can't find even a trace of the flashlighting, it only seems to be when the movie is loading. I am sure some people will be turned off by the bright spots on the load screen. Also, the viewing angle of this TV definitely has a little bit of an issue. That doesn't at ALL mean that if you are sitting on the extreme sides you won't see a picture, it just means that the picture looks better sitting directly in front of it than it does from extreme angles. Even standing right along side you can still SEE a picture (not that you'd ever watch from that angle anyway), but the further out to the sides you get from the tv, the colors wash out slightly. Again, to me this is nitpicking, because the way my room is laid out, no seats will suffer from any loss of Picture Quality. If you are planning on putting the TV in a bright room, this TV has a Plasma-like gloss to the display and can definitely pick up more reflection than most LEDs do. As long as you are putting it in a room without excess light, that shouldn't be a problem.Overall I'd give this TV a 90/100, only docking some points for flashlight effects and viewing angle. I really wish I could give this 4.5 stars, but Amazon does not give that option. I am a little leary of putting a 5-star review on it because of just a few small issues, so 4 stars it is.

On PAPER, this TV was merely competitive in terms of features and price. Its only when I actually went and saw it live and in person along side dozens of other sets on a show room wall... did I come to the realization that there was no comparison. This set was by far the best in it class. It even rivalled the top of the line LEDs cost $1000 more.The Sharp Quattron is strikingly vivid - so life like, in fact, that we often comment that its just like being on the set of our favorite sitcom, or sitting in an IMAX theater watching \"Blue Planet\" in HD. The colors, particularly colors that include yellow, are \"true to life.\"But frankly none of that matters - what matters is how it looks when watching football. This is where it REALLY excels. Maybe its the extra yellow capable pixels, don't know... aall I know is the grass looks more real than the real grass I see outside my window (\"grass is always greener on the others side of the scree?\". The acuity of the picture is so sharp that I can actually see and make the \"close calls\" in most football games before the announcers or the refs. Absolutely no blur or ghoasting even watching Sammy Watkins run.  Oh, and I'm finally watching hockey for the first time in a long time because NOW, I can actually see and follow the puck.The only problem is, now all my friends (who all own their own HD big screens) want to come to my house to watch the game.

Think of what comes after the word french when ordering with a big mac. The price at the store is an incredible 1499.00 and it is bundled with a 3d Blu Ray player. I called Amazon as I am a Prime Member and I have spent $$$$$ on Amazon in the past 7+ years. I told them about this store and I was transferred to the Large size items departments since this was for a 60 inch TV. The person I spoke to was very nice and went to the website and did see the ad that comes out every FRYday in the newspaper. When he clicked on the link it took him nowhere. When he added the TV to the cart it does not show up as a bundled deal for 1499, it showed up as a single purchase for 2133. I told him I work right across the street from the store and i saw the TV package inside the store and he agreed he sees the ad but it will not bundle online. I LOVE Amazon and I really wanted to purchase from them but they would not match. I ended up last night buying the TV bundled with the 3D Blu Ray player for 1499 at the store. They are 265 less then Amazon, and they include a 3D Blu Ray player, and I was also able to change to a LG BD670 (I have had a good experience with this model) instead of the Sharp BDHP35U as the Sharp is not rated that highly at no extra charge. Remember even at the brick and mortar stores everything is negotiable.Now as far as the TV, it is incredible compared to anything in its price range. When you get above 2K, yes I thought the Samsung was awesome, but the glare on the Plasma's was atrocious. I brought my 2 girls and my wife into the store and we watched Despicable ME in 3D and my kids were reaching out to touch the characters. We then watched it in 2D and the picture was just as awesome as the pricier Samsung. One more note- I went to the store the day before and fell in love with this TV, however it was 1999 and included no bundle. Nobody at the store mentioned to me that the next day it was going down to 1499 and with a 3D Blu Ray player included.

The picture is gorgeous, bar none, I'm so happy with that. When I first plugged it in and turned it on, it was bright like a tanning bed, so I turned the backlight way down to a reasonable level and it was much easier to watch. I'm extremely picky about color reproduction; I use calibrators on all my PC monitors that cost several thousand dollars, just to give you an idea. While the Sharp Aquos OOB picture quality isn't perfect, it's totally watchable. I'll eventually sit down and go through the entire calibration process (of which then I'll update this review) but its not bad at all, so it wont be a priority. I played around with some of the settings, but without looking at the manual. I consider myself a pretty technical person, but some of the menu settings weren't clear as to what they did. So you'll definitely need to review the manual to really understand what all the settings do, even if you're proficient at these sorts of things. I watched my first Blu Ray in 1080p (my last TV was only 720p and nowhere near as sharp)and it was like a completely different movie, I was astonished at the clarity and detail that was now visible. I'm so in love with this TV and can't ever see going to the expense and inconvenience of a movie theater ever again.Ok, now onto the bad stuff. In its first 3 days in operation (for a total of maybe 5 hours) its already \"crashed\". The audio went out and then after a few minutes the picture went black. I though oh well, I'm having antennae problems again (yes I was using OTA signal) and turned it off. A few hours later I turned it on and it didn't respond at all. The light came on but that was it. I eventually unplugged the TV for about 1 minute plugged it back in and it worked fine again, so clearly something wasn't quite right with the set. I know computers can be finicky, (really this *is* a computer with a really nice built in monitor), so they crash once in a while. I just hope this isnt a regular thing as the plug is really difficult to get to. Also, this is personal taste, but I hate the silky smoothness the 120hz adds to the picture so I disabled that right away. Its hard to get a tv of this quality though that doesn't have that, I'm just glad it can be disabled. And lastly, the built in wi-fi stinks. I have a strong dual band signal in the next room, but the TV says its only 1 bar of 5 and I haven't been able to get it to connect for more than a few minutes before dropping the signal. My HTPC however with its antennae receiver gets a full strong signal and has no problems streaming hi-def netflix videos into the same room. So since I have that, I don't care much for the built in, but still I figured it would be better. My priority though was for a great picture and that's what I got, so I'm happy. I also wanted to address some of the complaints about a 'milky' picture you can see. I've seen it only on fully black screens, but it is extremely subtle and not noticeable at all when you have a regular picture playing. Even really dark films like Batman and Nightmare Before Christmas still look stunning and don't exhibit any 'milky' oddness in the picture related to that.

I wear hearing aids and need to use the audio out to my unit that broadcast to my headphones. There is only one audio out put and it's like a mini headphone jack so I need an adapter to hook it up.

It would be nice if this TV could play a wider variety of file types.  In addition, the file listings have an odd order and arent always in alphabetical order.  Another complaint related to this is I have yet to find a way when playing a video through the USB hard drive to get the sound to play through my home theater.Third, the tv claims it works well with DLNA.  I have found that with streaming movies for example, it becomes a slow impossible mess.  IT seems that this feature was not perfected and with Sharp seemingly no longer providing firmware updates for the TV (it has been several months since the last one), it looks like there will be no more fixes to help these features.Overall, I really like this Tv but the shortcomings keep it from being a five star TV.

He also pointed out it had a lot of other bells and whistles, but my sole purpose of purchacing a tv is for it's picture quality.  Boy, was I happy I upgraded to this newer version!  The picture quality is outstanding!  Blu-Ray movies are so incredible looking, even at 60\".

Set up was easy.  Just had to go through a quick set-up, then everything was good to go.  DirectTV broadcasts look good in HD as well.  The speakers are ok, but I don't think anyone should be expecting anything outstanding on flat screen tv's, especially when they're only 1\" thick.  If sound quality is an issue for you, you should always plan on having a different source for sound, from a sound bar to a full surround setup.  This still don't sound too bad by itself, but I'll allways be listening through my Sony reciever which plays uncompressed audio.  My only complaint is with the cable hookups in the back.  If you flush mount this moitor to the wall, it is very difficult to get your hand in to access the HDMI hookups behind the screen on the side.  And if you need to hook up anything that uses component cables or RCA cables, they face the back, not the side so it's next to impossible to install them without taking the monitor off of the wall, or risking the unit to crash to the floor when you lift it up to get back there.

Beautiful Picture!", "Author": "wmblalock", "ReviewID": "R1B3P3M8PJREBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research and store visits before I purchased this TV. Originally I wanted a plasma TV because I've heard they are the most realistic and price is considerably cheaper. During my store visits, every plasma I looked at seemed dim with bad whites compared to the bright beautiful LED TVs. At every store I went to, the Sharp LED TVs always looked the brightest and most vibrant out of ALL the TVs. On top of that, the price on the Sharp LED TVs was MUCH less than the high end Sony's, LGs, Samsungs, etc. I wanted a 65\" TV, but unfortunately Sharp doesn't make 65\" Quattrons. So that left me between the 60\" and 70\" Sharps. The 70\" didn't seem to have quite as good of a picture to me as this 60\" did, but that could have just been the movie they were playing at the store as well. Ultimately the 70\" 3D Sharp that I wanted was just too much money, almost double the price of this 60\". So, this 60\" is what I decided on. It is definitely the best \"bang for the buck\" for a high end 60\" 3D LED TV. The image is extremely vibrant, crisp, and clear. I think this picture quality beats every other TV they sell in the big name stores. 3D Movies also look amazing! Sharp has earned a returning customer!There are only a couple things I can mention that would have made this TV 100% perfect.First, it would be nice if Sharp included more apps, something more comparable to what Samsung offers, but it really isn't that big of deal to be honest, just an idea. Second, the only negative I could muster up for this TV is that if the screen is mostly black, and the TV doesn't automatically adjust the brightness/contrast down (which it usually does), then the black screen will have light and dark areas on the screen. I guess it's back light bleed technically, but it just looks like the screen has an inconsistent \"milky\" wash to it all. But, like I said, the TV usually adjusts when the screen is mostly black and the blacks look amazing with no bleed at all.

That was until I saw a Sharp tv on display at Costco playing a blu-ray; I was amazed with the picture quality, but I wanted a higher end model with 240hz, and the next day this tv pops up as an Amazon lightning deal.  Just what I was looking for at that moment.I received it mid-afternoon, calibrated it, and really enjoyed the picture.  The picture excels best during the day, but be careful as this set has a reflective screen which will reflect direct sunlight on it.  Later in the evening my g/f and I decided to watch Game of Thrones on Blu-ray which has a lot of dark scenes and the living room would be dark.  I turned on the PS3 and noticed the clouding right away as I waited for the blu-ray to load.  I'm not talking of clouding on just the corners, but throughout most of the screen.  It really stood out at night on dark load screens.  Later in the episode in a dungeon scene, I could see the white spots from the clouding on parts of the screen that were meant to be completely dark or black.  This was the most extreme clouding during any kind of playback.I knew there would be some possible clouding when I ordered it, but not on this level.  I mulled on keeping this for 10 days until I decided to contact Amazon for a refund.  I decided to purchase the Panasonic 60ST50 as originally intended.More on the clouding, it is almost unnoticeable during the day.  Now it's possible that the clouding on this set may be worse than normal, but I don't want to risk an exchange with the same issue.  During normal playback of movies / tv shows clouding wasn't very noticeable unless it was a delayed scene change or some sort of load screen whether it's a delay from changing channels, loading a blu-ray, etc. , but it's there.I'm not suggesting that no one buy this tv, just be aware of the possible clouding at night during load screens, very dark scenes, etc.  If this is something you can live with, then you will enjoy the otherwise great picture quality.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wi-fi and streaming are awful!", "Author": "Archetype", "ReviewID": "R1TE27GS6C0XQS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love the picture and certainly have no complaints there, but if you intend to do a lot of streaming over the internet via Netflix and such I'd choose another TV.

This 60\" really filled the bill. Unbelievable picture. While running Blu-Ray movies I just don't know how it could get any better without being there. There is only one problem that I have ran in to. The 3D requires that you be within 7.2 feet. 6 feet is better. That's very close. I did not read anything about that before I bought it. When I first tried 3D I sat in my usual spot about 10-11 feet away. I thought the 3D was not working. Then I started reading the manual, and found I should be closer. It works great! Wow, what a picture. But you do have to be close to get it right. The TV sends out a signal to your glasses. I guess the signal is not strong enough to reach 11 feet. But I only watch some movies in 3D so I guess it will have to do. I don't think you could get a better looking set for the money. Speakers?

Checked last Thanksgiving but couldn't find anything tempting. Was juggling between passive or active 3D. Passive 3D LED TVs were limited with only Vizio and LG and I was not too much impressed by those offerings. So was looking for some new offering in 2012 in passive world from S : Sony, Samsung, Sharp,... but was disappointed.So re-evaluated my wishlist again and decided to go with 60\" 3D LED 240Hz with some nice picture quality. Look around and talked to few friends regarding their experience and observation. That helped me narrow down my search to Sharp 60\" Quattron. Wanted to be little ready for next coming technology so opted 3D. End up finalizing on Sharp LC60LE835U. Check in store and found its picture quality performance as good as Samsung $2500+ TVs. Looked for better price and found a deal which amazon was good enough to match.Using this TV almost everyday and simply love it. Had to fine tune the setting little bit : turning on Auqa-motion, switching off Movie Mode, ... After that its 2D picture quality is awesome. It can play contents from USB directly quite fast. Netflix using Wifi connectivity is cool : no lag at all. 3D seems OK but I think 3D contents are not mature yet. Of all the 3D movies, AVATAR really impressed me.  So waiting for \"Avatar\" to come out in 3D blu-ray to really feel the 3D effect using this TV. Its sound quality is not good as we can't expect good sound quality from thin TVs anyway. Connected it up with Bose home-theater system and the integration is perfect. I can pass picture thru Bose and able to re-route TV's voice via Bose which helps me play any media from USB.Overall I will rate it at 4.5/5 because 3D needs more maturity. Not sure yet its the content which needs maturity or the TV technology needs improvements.Why buy from Amazon : Amazon has good price matching policy. They match with few good compititiors. There was a deal of free 3D glass with 835u series. I missed it when I order the TV.

HD channels are better but still have motion blur which is noticeable. This also differs from channel to channel and i noticed it is better and awesome in SYFY channel.This TV definitely has back lighting issues but not the worst. To me it does not interfere with my viewing pleasure.I found that it is noticeable in 3 corners if you are watching sitting right infront of the TV  at a distance of 10 feet. I dont think distance matters,just wanted to mention here. This is noticeable only in pure white or sky back ground or lighter back ground scenes . Otherwise it is perfect.Now the worse back-lighting is noticeable in the same lighter conditons i mentioned above when you are at an angle of  45 - 60 degress from the center on either side. This is visible on the top border of the screen all throughout from left to right. when i say visible white looks like very light gray cones laid one after the other. no big deal it is very very light. If i don't tell a new viewer he won't notice it 9 out of 10 times.Clouding issue is another which as mentioned by another reviewer happens only when changing channels and a black screen appears momentarily. Clouding does not seem to cause any issues otherwise.Sound as you know in any TV is flat and an AVR will do justice to a TV this size and dramatically improve your listening and viewing experience.3D - I only played the AFRICA 3D which i also bought from Amazon and it looks quite impressive in most scenes but not all. Eyes get tired quite easily.BLACKS ARE BLACK. The standard factory setting that comes with the TV does no justice to the deep black this TV is capable of producing.Increase the Contrast and reduce the Brightness to -3 or so. This is my preference but it does make remarkable difference to the dark grays the factory settings produce.Overall despite the backlight minor issues i will keep this TV as my wife aptly said, \"I already started falling in love with this TV\".A slightly better TV might be SAMSUNG which is priced almost double.

Yes, HDTV looks better, but I was quite surprised to find the non-HDTV channels looked very \"Sharp\" as well.I did a lot of shopping prior to this purchase, and I am happy to say that I think this is the best 3D TV on the market for the price.Pros:-Clean sharp picture-3D movies jump out of the screen (better than movie theatre IMO)-Simple feature, but hooked it up to PS3, and when you turn on PS3 to play a game; it automatically changes the source from cable TV to PS3 connection instead of me manually having to make the change.  While I know this is not a big deal (perhaps I am easily impressed), my other HDTVs require me to change the source in order to play games.  I really liked this feature.-Works great with playing PS3 games that are in 3D.  I found some cheap PS3 3d glasses at a mortar store, and they worked fantastic when viewing movies and PS3 3D games.  The glasses look cheap, but they work really well.Cons:-Sound system is not great.  I will say it is better than the normal Sharp 60 TV, but it is still subpar.  This was not expected, and most people have surround sound so this isn't much of an issue.  I haven't moved my surround sound yet.  This was just a TV I picked up so my wife would have something to watch while in the kitchen.-Sharp glasses are expensive.  I borrowed a pair from a friend, and while the quality of the glasses is better looking, they really aren't any better than the PS3 glasses that I bought.  (It's not like I am going to wear them in public so I chose price over quality for these any day of the week.-We are still a little early in the 3d era.  While I prefer active shutter over passive; I fear the new bluetooth or something better will come out soon.  I hope active shutter is not the Betamax in the VHS - Betamax war.  If you have never heard of Betamax then you should understand my concern.  If you have heard of betamax then you should really understand my concern. :)-Does not allow web browsing.  This is not really a big deal for me, but if you are expecting to use this TV to surf the web.....I strongly suggest you hook up your laptop and use it as your screen.  Web browsing is not legally available on this TV (yes, you can do Netflix, etc.), but it can be done if you really want to modify the system.

However I went through 4 of these units and most of them had the \"clouding issue\" - like patches of smoke in various parts of the screen - noticeable only when room is dark and in a black background.Pros:One of the things I liked was you can change the cc fonts and colors on this (even for analog cc) unlike other TVs I have tried.  Also when using the menu you can still continue to see the video unblocked (in about 46 inch size) - that is a nice thing because you can use it that way if you are sitting somewhat close to the TV or if the standard def broadcast is of poor quality (which will look worse on a 60 inch).  Sound was quite better than the current Panasonic TV I have.Cons:Clouding, Clouding, Clouding.  Also one of the 4 units I went through seemed to have bad \"pixelation\" compared to the others.  And one of them had a vertical line on the screen right out of the box on delivery.  Sharp needs to really UP their quality control.I tried to ignore the clouding, but for the price you pay for this TV I could not excuse it.

The good stuff, the television's best feature is that the television provide the best brightness that I saw. You will really notice it at best buy were the sharp is displayed next to the sony's, samsungs, panasonics, and lg's.  The quatron 4 colors is something you take for granted until you see it side by side with another tv displaying the same feed. The 3d effect is really good.  The bad stuff I'd that the Internet features are useless! I don't mind because I connect to Internet using the ps3, but sharp dropped the ball on this because when you want to show this feature to your friends you will be embarrassed! The apps were most likely written by either an intern or a high school student..lol the buttons on the tv.. Look nice as the light up as they are touch sensitive, but they are a nightmare when it comes to using then to select settings on the menu, don't lose your remote..lol  but the worst feature that makes me mad is that the television just like many others do not display or read direct tv's 1080p signal which comes in at 24 frames. Therefore I can only watch direct tv at 1080i, which is annoying! If anyone\"...\"...........gets it to work or knows of a work around let me know...  The 3d glasses use a round watch battery and they are not rechargeable, the switch to turn on the glasses is retarded! You have to push it once and if it flashed 3 times then it is on 3d. If you push it again and it flashes 2 times it is then turn off, this causes one to forget it you left them on or off.. No big deal but it just goes to show you how sharp engineers think, a simple on off switch would have made more sense.  I am happy with the television because of the freaking brightness..

They are noticable in light scenes and very annoying. Almost as if someone has smushed their finger int he TV and left a mark.Most of the screens I received had very uneven backlights or \"flashlighting\", thus in dark scenes and especially at night, the blacks looked VERY splotchy.One of the screens I received had dirt inside the LCD panel itself, at a distance you wouldn't notice it much, but I didn't find this to be acceptable quality control on a $2000 item.Finally, #8 appears to be close to perfect, no bright spots in the corners, no flashlighting to be seen, and no dirt in the panel.The first 7 TVs I received were all manufactured in August 2011, the last one I received that is perfect was made October 2011.Maybe the first ones I got were just a bad batch, or maybe Sharp got so many returns and complaints that they amped up their quality control now.Either way, I am very happy with my purchase. I love the TV. It has an amazing picture and all the features you could want.Amazon's willingness to exchange this TV numerous times, for free, just to \"make me satisfied\", has earned me as a customer forever.

I waited at least two weeks before I wrote this review. Perhaps that is not enough time to spend with this device and sound like an expert but I have formed my initial impressions.1. The out-of-the box auto settings are mind boggling in their affront to the eyes. They brightness of the image is inappropriate for any indoor use. The color presets (with the possible exception of movie mode) are Timothy Leary, Peter Maxx, and Andy Warhol friendly but not suitable for any sober human looking for a non- psychedelic experience.2. Item 1 can be fixed but not without some careful exploration of the setting in the menus and submenus. One reviewer on this site provided some helpful baseline settings. Thank you, J. Oki of Hawaii! You saved me a lot of time in experimentation.3. Once the automatic picture destroying settings have been disabled and the color and contrast dialed in a nice picture begins to emerge.4. There seems to be some sort of splotchy spotlighting effect occurring with the LED edge lighting. This is not noticeable for 95% of all pictures I have viewed but upon close inspection with a steady test pattern such as red field or 50% white, you notice some uneven backlighting.5. The remote is simple and nice.6. The silly power indicator must be turned off so as not to distract. Happily this is a single button push in some menu and yet it still will light up for a second or two so you know when you have turned the display on. This is a good thing.7. I cannot set up the Wi-Fi. Funny, I can manage to set it up easily for the Roku HD box in the same room and every other device in my home. This device simply refuses to engage with my router. Why? I don't know. Perhaps someday I can work it out. Perhaps it just is broken. It annoys me a little but I don't need anything it offers so I don't really care.8. The 3-D is OK I guess, fun to watch for a little while. Maybe I will grow to like it but I doubt that I will. In any case I only bought one pair of 3D glasses and I only own a single 3D Blu-Ray Disc (and before you go there, yes...I do have a 3D player).I chose this over the Samsung 3D 60\" because of the promise of enhanced color gamut but discovered that the Quattron technology is really only a parlor trick.There is no way to use an wider gamut (like XvYCC) signal to any advantage so I will need to wait for some large wide gamut OLED display in the future to become reasonably priced.

Not wanting to defy the law that states TV sizes should always go UP my attention was focused on the 70 inch.

Back at Sams club as we were about to purchase the LC-60LE832U I remembered the pic I took of \"that other tv\" at the exchange.  Turns out the one at the exchange is the LC-60LE835U.  A much nicer set and was on sale at the exchange for $1649.  Much less than the inferior model at Sams club.  Then in addition, my wife noticed a sight stating that the particular model we were buying was eligible for an additional 10% off.

Even with the defect I describe below the picture was amazingly Sharp and if it were not for a dead pixel I probably would have kept this unit.This was my second Sharp Quattron set, the first one I was so impressed with that I was REALLY stoked for this 3D version. Unfortunately, the set I received through Amazon had a screen with problems, first a sort of \"cloud pattern\" that become an issue when viewing sports like racing, any footage with bright landscape scenes, etc. I contacted Sharp to see how they would take care of this issue. I was asked to take photos of what I was seeing and send them via email. While taking photos for Sharp (which ended up being a joke) I discovered a dead pixel and that meant it was going back, regardless. While waiting for return shipper, I followed through with Sharp to get an idea of how their warranty service would be (for my other TV and a future Sharp purchase) and I got the definite feeling that they didn't want to replace this unit. This would be my warning to purchasers to consider a 3rd party extended warranty instead of Sharp's extended warranty since it was obvious to me (to my chagrin) that Sharp was going to drag it's feet on issues.Sadly, I was not able to test the 3D capability of this set due to the promotional 3D glasses not arriving in timely manner.This was the first time I've ever bought something as large as a 60\" HDTV via ANY internet retailer and once again Amazon was great, sending the TV very quickly and processing the return without any hardship or grief. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another big item like this from Amazon.I have since bought another Sharp and the screen is perfect (as it should be) which begs me to wonder if perhaps the shipper/warehouser's subjected the TV I received to extreme heat while in transit/storage, as it was HOT (temps averaging 105 daily) when I ordered it. Just a guess.I have owned several large screen TV's of all different types and the Sharp Aquos Quattron line has the most vivid and alive screen I've seen to date.

I ordered from Amazon on 12/5/11 because Best Buy would not match the Amazon price - my first attempt at a major purchase from Amazon.  It was delivered on 12/12/11 - the White Glove service was very nice.  The TV worked perfectly out of the box.  The picture is very sharp, clear, and colorful.  I studied all the available reviews on Amazon and Best Buy, and googled for professional reviews.  I have watched 3D movies on demand from Verizon Fios and they are fun to watch!! My studies revealed that the Sharp 3D TV emits a 17' viewing signal, while the Panasonic 3D has only a 10.5' viewing signal, a big difference if you have a large living room.  Reviewers did not like the OEM 3D glasses, so I bought 2 different pair of well-rated Universal 3D Glasses.  The less expensive pair was $54.95 from Amazon called \"Unversal Infrared Active Shutter 3D Glasses.\"  The more expensive pair was $99.00 from projector people.com, the newest Xpand model, X6D104.  They both work fine and the less expensive ones are lighter weight.  The conversion of 2D to 3D is also a nice feature since available 3D is still in its infancy.  I love this TV!

Never seeing one in person, I went ahead and purchased it, and I have to say, it exceeded my expectations.  I know Sharp touts the color quality because of adding yellow to the three additive colors (RGB).  Sounded like snake oil to me, but this is the third flat panel we purchased and the vividness of the yellows, golds, and blues (not sure whey blue is much more vivid) is amazing.I purchased a couple 3D movies (Coraline and Tangled mostly for the kids) with this and some universal 3D glasses (Sharp branded 3D glasses are way overpriced) as this doesn't come with any 3D glasses.

I am technically sound, have never had a problem I couldn't fix with any sort of technology whether it be a computer or television etc... Now enter this beauty from Sharp.  I ordered it and it shipped from Paul's TV.  Had everything set up  before it even arrived, blu-ray / home theater system all set just needed to plug in the hdmi cables and should've been good to go.  Alas it did not work, I plugged the TV in, its light on the front flashed twice, then five times and then it turned off, all the while a picture never was displayed, no noise, or menu screen, nothing.  I tried unplugging the tv and waiting a while before reconnecting, that didn't work.  I then tried different hdmi cables, still the same problem.  Then I tried a different outlet/surge protector but still the problem remains.  It is very disheartening when you pay for a television of this caliber and this high a price and get back what essentially amounts to a giant 60 inch paperweight.  I have never had this happen before and after doing some digging (a lot of digging) on the internet a found a few threads that suggest this is a power supply and a common problem for Sharp Televisions.  I will be calling Sharp tomorrow and if I am not satisfied that they can alleviate this problem without much effort on my part I can safely say it will be the last piece of business I do with that company.  I'll move on to one of their competitors like Sony, Samsung, or Vizio.So I haven't been able to actually watch anything on this tv, so it may actually have a great picture but I can only comment on what I have experienced and so far the experience is the worst television experience I have ever had.UPDATED: After starting what has been a horrendous experience with Paul's TV I had to start the return process with them.  It is a not an easy process like Amazon, I would avoid doing business with them If you could, I wish Amazon sold, shipped, and fulfilled this product.  Any how while waiting for this extraordinarily lengthy return process to be completed I was essentially forced to buy the television from another company.First off the TV has a really nice minimalist design, thin borders around the screen maximize the theater experience.  Just out of the box the TV displayed an Impressive picture.  That was before calibrating it, once I calibrated it and setting it up with my home theater system my experience was complete.  Picture was crisp, clear, defined, and gorgeous looking.  The picture settings have lots of options to tinker with to wind up with the picture settings that suit your taste.  So far blu-rays and FiOS tv has looked phenomenal on this set.  3d was excellent too, I tested it out with the new Conan the barbarian movie which isn't supposed to be that great in 3d, if that wasn't great I can only imagine how good Avatar looks.The remote is fine, not bad but I wouldn't say it was great.  Though it was comfortable to hold and I haven't had any real trouble with it.  The manual however is not so great, It has a ton of information in it but deciphering and finding that information is not intuitive.  I haven't used the speakers on this tv as I have it set up with my home theater system.  So the only negatives (if you can call them that) about this tv that I could find were the avg remote and the confusing manual.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sharp LED Flat screen 60\"", "Author": "Andrew F Morris", "ReviewID": "RT0G43ABTH9C3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Very nice TV.

I compared every model TV in the 55\" to 60\" inch screen and even purchased a few and took them back after not being to happy with there picture quality. I spent approximately 3 to 4 weeks looking and researching before I settled on the Sharp LC-60LE835U 3D TV. I read tons of reviews for this model as well as for other Shart 60\" inch models and found this particular one to be at the right price with the most features. I was a little nervous at first about ordering it on line with amazon because if I had any problems with it, it would be a hassle to ship back to them. But at the time there was free shipping, a 3D two pair of glasses for free bundle, and most of all no sales tax to pay. I figure why not and take a chance. I placed the order for the TV and later found out the glasses were subject to availability and that at the time of my purchase they were out of stock. I call amazon and asked for a rain check for them and they said they could not do that, but that hey would credit me back a $150 dollars off the TV to compensate for the glasses. I was pleased with this solution. The TV was schedule to ship and be delivered by 9-20-11 and that I would be receiving a call from the shipper once it arrived at the local facility for a delivery appointment. On 9-15-11 I checked the status of the shipment and realized the TV was delivered to the local facility about one hour from my house. I called the shipping company Pilot and asked them if we could set up the delivery date and time. The representative on the phone stated that I was out of area from them and that it would have to be transferred to another shipping company. I was quite mad about hearing this and called amazon to see if they could resolve this issue with pilot shipping. The amazon rep told me the same thing pilot told me so I ask if I could just go pick it up because I did not feel comfortable with my almost two thousand dollar tv being bounced around from carrier to carrier. Both companies said hat would be fine. I wasted my time and gas to pick it up. Well after finally gettin the TV and setting it up and watching a few 3D movies, I can say without a hesitation this is one of the best TVs on the market at this size and price. My warning to potential buyer is tha you look locally or at other online retail store that use another carrier other than pilot to deliver. Amazon I feel let me down as a customer because there attitude about the shipping switch and the fact the TV  was going to go way beyond it's original arrival date to my house was no big deal. The representative seemed more concerned  about getting off the phone with me than wanting to solve this issue. I can highly recommend this TV but I can't recommend buying it through amazon after my experiance with there customer service department. It may not seem like a big deal to some, but if the TV would have came in damaged or didn't work for some reason each carrier would blame the other and amazon would take it back and send a new one with the same shipping issues and now further out down the road in getting this TV. My best suggestion is to buy from the store with \"COST*O\" in there name. They price match for 30 days with a 90 day return policy and extend the warranty free for one extra year and offer an additional 3 years for $99 on tvs over $1000, so you get a 5 year warranty.

Being military, I purchased this at my local exchange so I saved the sales tax which I thought made it a deal I couldn't pass up, I wish I had.  Pros:  It's big so split screen is easier to play.....that's it I'm afraid.Cons:  The picture quality is nothing extraordinary or even great. Tuning the darn thing will drive you to pull your hair out and make you curse your decision to buy.  I won't waste my time to even count all the different adjustments you can \"try\" and make.  Why Sharp marketed such an UN-user friendly device I'll never know.  Now, you can search on line for others settings to try and save time and effort but good luck.  I have mine set to the highest sharpness and it's no better than my old box tv.  The inability to fine tune is compounded depending on what you're watching as everything isn't in HD meaning, spending so much for such a tv is a waste of money.Sound system:  They might not have even bothered.  To say you'll be immediately sad is an understatement.  Add on speakers start at around $100 and go up to $500.  So now you've spent $1500 dollars for the tv, plus tax and then you have to shell out another $100 +, it'll make you cry.My recommendations: If you want a big tv, stop at 55\".  55\" and below have fair prices and a much better picture quality.

Unless someone comes out with a hack, which I hope they do, then you are left with a simple web access for Netflix, Hulu, etc. that is pre-installed.And the four color is mostly a sales hype. The picture quality doesn't look any better than my Sony Bravia.Update: After using this TV for awhile I found that the web access goes through Sharp's servers.  There is no direct web access.  So I purchased the Logitec Revue with GoogleTV and greatly improved my reception and loading speed.  Hense to say, Sharp's servers leave a lot to be desired.I still stand by my original rating though because it did not meet my expectation of what I thought it should do.  Not every device is perfect for everyone's needs.  Each to his own.  My rating is not to cut the product but to inform others who might be looking for the same functions as I was.  If I rated it perfect then others would pass it off as another praise report.I have bumped it up by one star though because the picture quality of the set is not so much as the display as it is with Sharp's server.

I couldn't have been more wrong. Bottom line is this set has very poor image quality and that is after Amazon sent me three different units and after full calibration on all three. Here are my concerns on this set.1. Where 720p should look better than 1080i, it's just the opposite.2. Uniformity of clarity is very uneven across the screen.3. The extra yellow pixel is unnecessary and at best annoying. You really have to back off on the saturation level of the yellow or anything yellow will smack you in the face. I wonder if this is why skin tones are so green.4. No clock and limited program description in display.5. Channel recognition is slow, very slow.6. My main complaint is the sharpness control on these sets needs to be set at about the +20 to + 40 range in order to really get the HD to shine. That is way to high. You should never have to approach mid point setting on your sharpness to get good HD image quality.7. Film mode and Motion enhancement. Set these two together and feel like you are watching video all day. Soap opera effect. It does a great job at this. Yuck!I suppose the bottom line is stick with Samsung LED LCD or plasma if you want truly great quality.

I loved this T.V. the picture is amazing, but I basically have to set a T.V. that is not even two years old out for the trash man to pick up. It worked fine until one day it wouldn't turn on and the led arrow light at the bottom kept blinking. I did research on the internet to try to find a solution to the problem and even tried to do a hard reset, nothing. I called sharp and based on the pattern in which the led light was blinking they determined that the LCD screen was shot and replacing it would cost as much as the T.V. did new. If you google \"sharp aquos won't turn on,\" you will get pages and pages of complaints of the same nature. Not all were a bad LCD screen and some were fixable but this is insane. If I pay $2,000 for a television I expect it to last at least 7 to 8 years not one and a half.
