But as some of you guys know, HDTVs never show its peak visual potential out of the box....you have to mess around with its settings until you find the picture you are looking for. and YES that could be a challenge!!! i almost gave up on the TV until i looked up some other people's own personal settings....none of them worked for me so i bit the bullet and tweaked the settings for a few hours myself. sometimes you just gotta take matters into your own hands. And after all the tedious tweaking I HAVE FOUND THE PERFECT SETTINGS for both DVR and Video Games/Blu Ray!!! Give these settings a try and you won't be Disappointed! Before you read my settings just know that i like my TV nice and bright. if you don't like it as bright you can always set the backlight down to your liking. i feel these settings give you ultra light colors and the best lows i feel the TV could offer. A perfect blend. Here they are.PICTURE:StandardBacklight  18 (adjust if too bright)Contrast  90Brightness 42sharpness  25 (no more than 30)color  44tint  G50/R50Advanced Settings:Color Space  AutoGamma  +1Dynamic Contrast  Low (or OFF if you contrast is too dark for your taste)Black Tone  OFFFlesh Tone 0 (no more than +1)Motion Lighting OFFWHITE BALANCER-Offset  18 (set to 17 if there is still a slight red hue. i noticed a slight red coloring when watching SD films so i set it back 1 notch and it looked fine)G-Offset  20B-Offset  20R-Gain  25G-Gain  25B-Gain  25(if you set your color offsets too high then your blacks with have a Red, green or blue tint to them. which can be very distracting)PiCTURE OPTIONSColor Tone  Standard (Cool also looks great for movies and video games with these settings)Size  Screen FitDigital Noise Filter  OFFHDMI Black Level  Normal or Low (unless option is greyed out, in which \"Normal\" looks great too with these settings. i have my cable input setting at normal and PS4 input set to LOW.Film Mode  OFFAuto Motion Plus  OFF (if you like the Soap Opera look then set to Clear or Smooth. I do feel like it hinders the quality of the image at times though)LED Motion Plus OFFThere Ya Go!!! Hope This helps get your TV up and running! let me know what you think! and yes, everybody's eyes are different so feel free to make minor adjustments (give or take) but yes it will get you in the right path!", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great samsung tv for the money", "Author": "Brian Clark", "ReviewID": "R2DUK43LVF2XTE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a 2014 samsung model tv that has a great picture.

Our 55\" was heavy enough that I helped the deliveryman set on our table.  They call an hour before delivery to insure you are home.  They are capable of lifting by themselves, but Iwas able to help and speed the process up.  They also plug in to insure a working set.  Then, like Santa, they are off!2nd--the picture was awesome out of the box, but I didn't care for the Soap Opera Effect (SOE).  I looked through the reviews tilI found one that had the specs he used on settings and printed them out.  Sat in front of the TV and worked it out.3rd--I don't use the sound on the TV (which causes many 3 star reviews).  I simply bought a new surround system amp with HDMI  outs and run everything through it.  Most people would like to Audio Out to a soundbar and are very dissappointed that this TV doesn't have audio out jacks.  But there are workable solutions, like my amp.4th--Did I mention the picture?5th--Great price during Black Friday week, as Amazon was competing with Walmart on this unit.

However, I didn't the expense of a 3D TV, especially for the target location of this one, and I didn't want some app system that would just get out dated before the panel did. However, I did want a good sized TV with new technology. This TV has fit the bill.The colors are good, the brightness is great, and the sound is better than the 15 year old computer speakers with sub (so they got retired). (This isn't in a movie room, so it doesn't need to sound like it has 10\" woofers and 15\" subs.)Neither my wife or I like the motion smoothing effect. Overall, it just doesn't improve the experience -- and feels like it makes things look worse and can even make us feel woozy. So, simply solution: We turn it off. Of course, we have to turn it off in a couple of places and it goes right back on if the TV loses mains power for too long.It is truly free of apps, wifi, and other Smart TV features. We already had a Roku and Chromecast for such features.Mounting it on a swinging arm mount made for this size TV was trivial and the whole thing can move about when needed (useful if changing cables).The bezel is narrow -- the whole package is not much bigger than the 40\" Samsung it has replaced.The price was fantastic when we got it.Overall, we're very happy with the size and features.

We also noticed that the TV stand would not swivel - because it was stationary the only way to turn the TV was turn the entire set.  Then we noticed that we could not plug in our stereo system for surround sound as there were no connectors!  The only component we could attach is our DVD player.  Be warned if you are thinking of buying this TV - we have returned it to the dealer.  Not what we thought it would be.

We were ready to return it the first day.  The picture was blurry and we were getting motion sick - even from 14 feet back from the set.  We talked to Samsung (Costco customer service rep could not help & claimed Samsung was closed - which it was not).  Samsung said this is a HDTV and we need to upgrade our cable box to HD.  We did that today and WE ARE NOT TAKING THIS BACK!  Wow, what a difference!  Before the cable guy came I was able to go to the manual settings (in menu/mode/picture options/auto motion plus/custom) and change the blur and judder settings.  I had a reasonable picture but it was not good enough to justify $900 after tax and warranty.  You will need HD for this TV.Only two HDMI ports might become a problem.  One port for my cable box & one for my receiver.  I have plugged the TV into my HDMI 1080 Sony receiver but something is still wrong there.  I still need to upgrade my DVD player to HD and hopefully my WII will somehow integrate into the receiver or I will need another WIFI source - this is not a smart tv.  There is one yellow/red/white cable option which my non-HD DVD player was compatible with but, again, the picture was not worth the $$$.You might want to play with the auto motion plus options once you are up.

Maybe $2,500.00 - $3,000.00 is not a lot of money for some folks to spend on a television, but it is to me.  This is money I'll never get back, nor derive true enjoyment, nor value from due to the DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG product that I purchased.  After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.  This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.  Consumer's have complained all over the internet.  There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in many other DEFECTIVE SAMUNG models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00!Furthermore, I was informed that the repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....at which point the technician basically stated, \"just buy another TV.\"SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at a rate of 20% per year, and that they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money on SYSTEMICALLY DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG TELEVISIONS, and a company that offers zero customer service....I'll be happy!
