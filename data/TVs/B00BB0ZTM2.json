{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice basic television at a very reasonable price", "Author": "Paul S. Remington", "ReviewID": "R3V8CFGTUQ3FPV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased the LG 32LN5300 32\" television for our toddler's playroom, so we didn't want anything too big or too expensive.  I looked at all our options and narrowed down my search to the LG 32LN5300 based on image quality, features, and price.  My basic requirements were that it had to be 1080P and offer at least two HDMI inputs.  There was one other television that was $50 less than the LG, but I opted for the LG because the image quality was noticeably better and off-axis viewing was far superior.  The other television was an Insignia.The first thing I'll say about the LG 32LN5300 is this television is mostly about image quality; the image quality is its most outstanding feature.  Like most flat-screen televisions, especially on the budget market, audio quality is not its strongest asset.It offers two 10W speakers (20W total) that produce a very nice volume that will easily fill a moderately sized room enough that you can probably hear it well in an adjacent room.  Don't expect to get a nice full-bodied sound with rich low end.  Its sonic body is thin.  With that said, the settings do offer the ability to tweak the audio and you can set the treble and bass.  This helps somewhat and lessons the boxy sound a bit.  Virtual surround settings also enhance the audio effect.  Just be aware that the audio quality is enough to get by, which makes it fine for a bedroom, den, or play room.  If you want added audio quality, consider purchasing a separate speaker system.Where this television excels in its price range is in image quality.  The monitor does an excellent job at projecting a clean image with crisp detail and very nice image contrast and color tone.  There is an abundance of expert settings that allow you to configure gamma levels and many other complex settings that most users will never know how to set.  Some of these settings can get you into trouble, so if you play with them, expect to possibly reset everything back to the factory default if you screw things up.  But don't be intimidated.  The settings are easy to access using the remote and all the basics are there: brightness, contrast, color, tint, backlighting, etc.After initially setting up the television, I wasn't overly pleased with the image quality.  After maybe twenty minutes of customization, I now have things configured and am very pleased with the image quality.  If image quality is important to you, expect to spend a little time configuring the settings to your liking and don't get upset if the first image you see isn't what you expected.  It's designed to allow for user configuration.This television is ideal for applications that don't require extra features or an abundant quantity of inputs and outputs.  The 32LN5300 comes with only two HDMI inputs, one on the back and one on the side.  If you're wall mounting the television, keep in mind that the back HDMI connector requires you to use an HDMI cable with a 90-degree connector or adapter.  If you don't, the television won't lay flush against the wall because the cable will get in the way.Along with two HDMI connectors, the television comes with one composite and one USB input.The 32LN5300 is Energy Star compliant and sips power at a rate of approximately $6 a year when the Eco setting is configured (default).There are a number of reviews that complain about faulty power issues.  Some of these reviews are related to purchasing used equipment.  I'm very concerned about this, but so far, we haven't experienced this problem, perhaps because we purchased it new.  If we do, I'll immediately update this review and report it here.  If you don't see any added update regarding this, our television is working fine.Overall, the LG 32LN5300 is a very nice basic television that produces a beautiful image.  The sound is a bit thin, but the audio can be configured to make the out-of-the-box settings a bit bolder.  It's not built for sound; it's build for economy of purchase and image quality.  We're very happy with the screen quality.  Based on our experience, we would recommend this television for those who need a basic set without an abundance of features or connections.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "No frills, but probably the best TV in it's class for the price.", "Author": "TronixSage", "ReviewID": "R29DM5V6COPSRM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for my 91 year old grandmother who decided it was time to spend a little money on herself (I purchased from Amazon and she reimbursed me). Before this, she was using a 27\" JVC CRT that was nearing the end of its useful life since the screen kept getting progressively darker and any programming showing dark scenes was almost impossible to see (and that was with the brightness turned all the way up). At the same time, she was getting sick and tired of paying for basic cable service (about $25/mo) so I purchased a cheap RCA antenna (ANT111) to take advantage of the free OTA digital channels. She lives 5-7 miles from most of the towers and was able to pick up 39 digital channels with this antenna (she was previously only getting 10-15 channels from Time Warner).While searching for her new TV, I had to consider space and price. I felt that a 32\" TV would have been too small and since I couldn't find any suitable options in the 35-37\" range I started looking at the 40\" TVs. Unfortunately, these were out of her budget probably due to their \"smart\" options - which she will never use and their 120Hz refresh rates. Also, I needed to keep the overall width of the TV to 35\".I then turned my search to 39\" models and narrowed it down to the Samsung UN39FH5000 and the LG 39LN5300. To make an extremely long story short, I have a grudge against Samsung because I've been burned so many times in the past (google \"Samsung panel lottery\"). It was hard for me to consider the Sammy, but I think it was the next best option to this LG (even though the Sammy was four bills and the LG was just over three).I had the TV shipped to my home so I could evaluate it prior to setting it up for her. Set up was easy and straight forward. Three Philips head machine screws attach the bracket to the base, the TV slips over the bracket and secures with four Philips head machine screws with washers.BUILD QUALITY (7/10): The build quality of this TV is above average if you consider its budget friendly price. I am only disappointed with the quality of the stand as it's as light as a feather and is made mostly from cheap plastic and a thin metal support strip. The stand for my Sony TV weighs 5 lbs and the one for my Panny weighs 10 lbs. Both are made from a combination of sturdy plastic and metal.HD PICTURE QUALITY (8/10): The HD picture quality is actually better than I was expecting. I tested the TV with my HD converter box and BluRay player in 1080p. The quality closely matched my Sony TV which cost three times as much. Some of the OTA channels are 720p and they look very good too. You won't be disappointed in the picture quality.UPCONVERTED PICTURE QUALITY (8/10): I think this category should be taken with a grain of salt since the upconverted quality is likely to differ between DVD/BD players. My Sony DVP-SR500H player does an average job (maybe a 6/10) while my Sony BDP-S590 player is above average (maybe an 8/10).SD PICTURE QUALITY (8/10): I was pleasantly surprised with the SD picture quality of this TV. It was much clearer compared to my Sony (both this LG and my Sony don't even come close to my Panny). Jaggies were hardly noticeable at all. Just remember, 8 out of 10 here looks really good and helps the overall score, but this is just a rating on the SD picture quality. If I had to compare the SD to HD picture quality, the SD would be somewhere around a 6 or 7 if the HD quality were a 10.MOTION BLUR & MOSQUITO NOISE (7.5/10): I watched a football game on ESPN and noticed some slight motion blur. It wasn't very bad or even distracting, but it was there. Also, I noticed some mosquito noise around the players. What really disappointed me was the motion artifact when watching cartoons. I watched an episode of Family Guy and every time the camera moved the picture shook which was annoying. This annoying level of artifact was present when I streamed the first episode of Under the Dome especially during the part where the dome came down and Barbie witnessed the cow getting sliced in half. What an awesome show btw.SCREEN UNIFORMITY (7/10): There are a few bright strips that run the entire vertical length of the screen on the far left and right sides. These bright strips fade significantly when the backlight and brightness are turned down. They are more noticeable if viewing 45 degrees or more from center, less noticeable when viewing from center.BANDING (8.5/10): This TV does suffer from banding issues, but it's only noticeable when white backgrounds are displayed or probably less than 5% of the time. I watched a few hours of cable programming the other night while testing this TV and only noticed it very briefly.COLOR (7/10): Right out of the box I felt the color on this set was slightly faded or washed out. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I prefer my colors to have a little more pop. I did try calibrating the color and that helped immensely. Out of the box rating would have been a 5.SOUND QUALITY (7/10): Right out of the box I would have given this TV a 5 for sound. After tweaking the ClearVoice settings and using the \"music\" mode, I was pleasantly surprised that my grandmother could actually hear this TV. It is much clearer than her old JVC and actually filled her 12x12 room with plenty of sound (volume level between 10-15). Bass was initially set to 50, I increased it to 75 and might do so again because this thing really lacks depth. ***update*** As of lately, my grandmother has been having a hard time making out the dialogue so I purchased her a sound bar with front facing speakers. The sound bar was an immediate improvement over the TV speakers.REMOTE (9/10): Most HDTVs that I've owned or purchased for friends and relatives come with remotes that are absolutely huge and oddly shaped. This remote is quite compact and fits very comfortably in my hand. Unfortunately, with a compact remote the buttons are closer together and this remote feels a bit crowded. I would think that even after sufficient time of getting used to this remote, the user could accidently hit some of the buttons if they weren't watching what they were doing or if they were using the remote in a dark environment. It would have been nice if the remote had backlit buttons.OVERVIEW: As I mentioned, this TV is for my 91 year old grandmother. It is the largest TV she has ever owned, but probably not the most expensive. The look on her face when I pulled it out of the box was priceless - I don't think she ever imagined having a TV this large and this nice for the budget friendly price.MY RATING:Build Quality 7.0/10HD Picture Quality 8.0/10Upconverted Picture Quality  8.0/10SD Picture Quality 8.0/10Motion Blur/Mosquito Noise 7.5/10Screen Uniformity 7.0/10Banding 8.5/10Color 7.0/10Sound Quality 7.0/10Remote 9.0/10Total 77/100", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG 39LN5300", "Author": "Chris_PHS89", "ReviewID": "R35NWQEIQ21WR2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the 39 inch. First impressions. Picture is excellent without making any adjustments. I have it hooked up to Directv through the HDMI input. I watched a movie on a non HD channel and the picture looked almost as good as an HD channel. I think the TV has some kind of up converter built in.Common with most flat screen TV's the speakers are under the front of the TV and sound is less than impressive. I compare the sound to listen to something through a tin can. Plan to get a sound bar in the next few weeks.So far I really like this TV. As always Amazon's price was by far the lowest.  Got one for $314.99 it was originally 387.99 but Amazon marked it down several times. I would buy another one if I had anywhere to put it.Update 7/17/13I have had this TV for a few weeks now. I was worried about buying a 60hz TV but no trouble what so ever. I have watched NASCAR, Baseball, Football and all other types of programing. I see no motion blurring at all on this TV. The picture is just amazing. Crisp, clear and the color is really good. Thats without any adjustments. I'm using the standard picture setting and have the energy saver set on low. Have not purchased a sound bar yet. Adjusted some of my sound settings and is a little better. Some channels have really good sound and some don't. DVD's have good sound. And speaking of DVD the picture quality looks as good if not better than Directv's 720p and 1080i HD. The DVD picture quality is so good I have not even considered a Blu Ray player. I have my DVD player hooked up through the component input. The Blue Green and Red.

I have three other LG TV's in the following sizes, 32\", 47\" and 55\".  This is the 2013 year model and my other TV's were from 2011 and 2012.  When the TV arrived I unpacked the boxed and noticed a 4\" x 4\" bracket that was not listed in the manual.  After looking at it again, I noticed that it was a Joey mounting bracket from DishNetwork's Hopper system!!!  Now how did that get in there?  It was even wrapped in the white foam like the rest of the TV.  After looking closer at the box, there was two rows of tape on the top of the box sealing it closed.  I hooked up the TV and it powered on for about 4 seconds and then turned off.  After 1/2 of trying to get the TV to stay on, I called LG's support and they were of no help.  After changing to a different power cord, the TV would stay on for 4 minutes and then turn off for 15 seconds and then back on.  The next morning I tried it again and it would not stay on for more than 4 minutes without turning off.  My final thoughts were that this must have been returned and somehow reshipped out.  So I had this TV returned and a replacement sent.  The next TV did the same thing!!  Agh! I decided to move this TV to another room with a different Sat Receiver and HDMI cable just to make sure there wasn't a problem in that room.  The results were the same.  8-(.  I hooked up my old TV and it is working great, so it is not a power or Sat problem.  The 30 day support from Amazon was refreshing!!  No over seas support and they were located in Oregon.  The tech went through the usual fixes for this type of problem and it looks like another defective TV.  Thumbs up to Amazon and their return process, but thumbs down for this model so far.  I did notice that this model is stripped down in that it will not play video through the USB port like two of my other LG TVs.  It looks like the newer models will not play video unless it is a higher end version unlike last years models.  8-(  What's up with this LG????  I will most likely check out the Samsung version of this TV now.  On a side note, when I could get this TV to power on, the picture looked much better than the Vizio 26\" model it was replacing, but the Vizio got the last laugh as lest it would stay on! <G>", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purchased 12.

One of the TVs turned itself off and on and ultimately failed to turn on again. There is at least one other buyer who experienced this problem. When the first TV failed I replied to his posting. You can read it under his post. I decided to create a new post after the second TV failed. 2 out of 12 is a very high failure rate. I am very disappointed. The TVs I purchased are the 42\" version.

I gotta say that i'm 100% satisfied with this tv. I purchased the 32\" to use as an office gaming tv, as well as a monitor for my macbook pro. In both cases, it performs extremely well. First of all as a gamer, its hard to find a tv in todays times that has low input lag. While I dont have a testing device, I can tell you that this tv has very little input lag. As a barometer, I have a Panasonic tc-l37e3, which is supposed to be one of the lowest tv's for input lag, around 10ms, this tv is right there, and feels every bit as responsive, but it also has much better black levels.

I was pleased that this LG set cost about half of what I paid for my previous TV, a Samsung LED that became unusable after only five years, but there's a reason why the unit is so inexpensive.I chose an LG after reading a magazine article by the celebrated author Nicholson Baker praising LG as the leading manufacturer of flat-screen displays. In it, he reveals that LG makes the displays for most Apple products, including their touted Retina Display, as well as other brands of hand-held devices, but I confess that I can't really discern much difference in the picture quality between this set and my old Samsung or, for that matter, other new LCD televisions I've seen. It provides a fine, bright display (if adjusted properly), but they're all pretty good to my fading vision that was once satisfied with CRT TV.In addition to a good picture, buyers also want features and ease of use. The LG remote control comes with an INFO button that displays the title of a program or movie and how long the show is scheduled to run. Being a compulsive channel surfer, I like that.Very few TV sets that I've seen of late come with internal stereo speakers that produce impressive sound, and the internal speakers of the LG are worse than those of any TV set I've ever owned. The internal audio amplifier puts out a measily 10 watts at 10% distortion! Not a good choice for viewing concerts.The reason manufacturers skimp on the quality of internal speakers is that owners who desire theater-quality sound have their set connected to an external audio system. Those who have spent extravagant sums on audio typically have the latest 5.1-channel Dolby(tm) system and an array of speakers, but my high-end system, which I'm still satisfied with, is older and merely handles two-channel stereo.This creates a problem, because one of the reasons that the new sets have come down in price is that they've eliminated the large array of input and output jacks on the back of the set. That's true not just of this LG, but all the consumer-grade low-priced sets I looked at have only the minimum of inputs and outputs.  There are RCA-phono input receptacles for an old-fashioned DVD player, but gone are sockets for connecting a VCR. (Which is now as obsolete as an 8-track, and it's time you sent all those treasured video tapes to the landfill.)  There are two HDMI inputs, but one is on the side, which may or may not suit your instalation. I'll refer you to other reviews here to illustrate the shortcomings of the single USB port.The only audio output, and the only way to connect the set to a decent sound system, is through a single digital optical audio port which accepts a fiberoptic Toslink Cable.  (Amazon has a good price on one.)  That was no problem for me, because I've been using the optical audio output on my Mac for years, and with a quality external digital-to-analog convertor, there is a satisfying improvement in sound.Digital-to-analog convertors have also come down in cost, and Amazon also has good prices on them (though many are sold through independent sellers).  But when I connected the LG 32LN5300 to a standard D/A convertor and to my stereo system, I got no sound at all!  This is where the fun began.The magazine article I mentioned above touted LG's devotion to customer satisfaction, and I'm here to say that's udder buncombe. (I also remembered that I never cared for any of Nicholson Baker's novels either.) My first three posted messages to LG's customer support site resulted in replies that were of no help whatsoever. It is impossible to reply to LG's messages, so each attempt at solving the problem meant starting from scratch at their website. When I phoned the LG help desk, I confess that I lost my temper when the fellow suggested that I had to instead call the maker of the D/A convertor, and ask >them< if their convertor is compatible with LG products. That's a typical ploy of poor customer service: fob the customer off onto another company.In response to my fourth message, I was finally informed that the audio output of the LG 32LN5300 is in the Dolby AC3 format.  This specification is not given in the owner's manual nor at the LG website.  Amazon to the rescue again, and I purchased a Panlong Optical SPDIF/ Coaxial Digital to Analog RCA Audio Decoder Converter that worked . . . sometimes.Depending on whether the source is in the Dolby format the sound from my external audio system is sometimes annoyingly delayed so that it is obviously not in sync with the picture. Sometimes the external audio is not available at all, which requires shutting off the TV and turning it back on. Beware that if you plan on connecting the LG 32LN5300 to an external audio system that's in mere stereo, you will have unsolvable problems.I will assume that another defect of the LG 32LN5300 would also apply mostly to older users, but if you are among those of us who yet get your TV signal from broadcast sources, as opposed to cable TV, this set's tuner is poor. If I were to stand on the roof of my home, I could see the transmitter towers of the local stations on the horizon, but sometimes the LG's tuner picks their signals up from my rooftop antenna . . .  and sometimes it doesn't.  With the popularity of cable TV, LG apparently figured, pess on `em, and they could get by with a cheap tuner.And for guys, it's essential that the remote control be responsive and easy to use. The LG remote, however, is flaky and requires fiddling. Switching input sources is an ordeal which requires the use of both hands. Accidentally hitting a wrong button requires scrolling down to an on-screen EXIT button to close a window. If you have virtuoso remote skills, guys, you will not be satisfied with the LG instrument.It's a cheap set, and you gets what you pays for. As with automobiles in the 1980s, the goal of designers of home electronics today seems to be not to make the product better, but to make it cheaper and hence more profitable.FOLOW-UP REPORT:  After a mere six months, the ON/OFF switch on the LG remote control stopped working. The workaround to this defect is to tune to a channel with no signal (there is no Channel One, so I use that), then the set will eventually turn itself off after a while. I can then turn it back on using any other key.Remember when Made-in-America appliances like Zenith worked for ten or twenty years without needing repairs?", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "died 32 days after it arrived.", "Author": "J.

Ramm \"Steve Ramm \"Anything Phon...", "ReviewID": "R2ON05QO9VZHEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 35 year old trusty Sony  26\" Trinatron (with a large tube and great sound - but weighing 185 pounds!) was taking up too much room and so I bit the bullet and started looking at flat screens. I did a lot of research on Amazon and elsewhere and was lead to this set. I also went to Best Buy to see it in person.  My old set had a 15 inch high image and was 4:3aspect. To get the same height image in a wide screen for an old 26\" set you need a 32 in wide screen (16:9). And that's  what looked at. The price on Amazon was $299. But then I saw that the 39 in one was only $314. - $15 more - and got that.I knew going in - because of seeing models in stores - that NO thin flat screen has the sound of a CRT TV. The speakers are always in rear and they are tiny. And case of the old Sony was wood, while this is plastic. So I knew I might need to add a sound bar ($100-$150) but I haven't yet.I've had this set for 3 weeks and am very happy with it. The picture is great though I had to tweak the brightness on some. Let me add here that I do not have cable - I use a rooftop antenna and get clear pictures. I bought a new BD player as well (Samsung for about $69.) Review posted separately (see my \"other reviews\") In fact we liked this set so much we bought another a few days later for bedroom.It was easy to set up and you don't need to \"calibrate\" the image. If you choose the Aspect Display to be \"as determined by program\" it will automatically put the black bars where they need to be. Some shows are not 16:9 and many folks want to fill their screen so they stretch the image and everyone on screen looks fat. Black bars on the left and right side mean that the image is correct and that is acceptable - especially when watching old tv shows or older films.The first purchase was for my Media room where I sit about 6-8 feet away from set. So I didn't need a larger one - even 42 inches would be too big. For value I think this was the best deal and can recommend it.If it has one downside - really minor - it that the remote is not lit so I'm learning by feel which buttons do what. I wear reading glasses and still have to put them on periodically to see what the button labels say.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\"", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "BIG fan of LG .

A note here is that the manufacture date on the LG was July 2013, the same month that I received the TV. In other words, this 'used' TV was fresh off the manufacturing line in Mexico. When buying used products through Amazon Warehouse deals, my suggestion is to pay the extra $10 or $20 to get the items in Very Good condition but not Like New.

I received it as gift for father's day and according to my wife, was on a super special price at a local store.  Obviously some reviewers have issues with the TV turning on/off or failing to work at all.  Mine (knock on wood) is solid after 2 months of owning it.  I'm pleased with everything it offers and at the start here I'll state - it's a great looking television with enough features you need and nothing extra that's useless.The good - First and foremost, the picture on this is excellent which is what you mainly want of your TV.  It's obviously 1080 and looks very sharp and clear.  Others have commented it's not sharp up close... well as TVs go up in size, they're meant to be viewed farther away... anyway.  The picture (once adjusted, more below) looks fantastic with colors being pretty true, details are sharp, and blacks/greys look good even in a dark scene.  It has direct LED which is overall better than edge-lit for most reasons.  Sure, this TV won't win any skinny contests by today's standards, but going back even 10 years this thing is small!  I'm fine with a 2'' thick TV.The refersh rate being only 60hz is fine by me.  My mother has the previous years LG TV but a higher end one with the 120hz and it either looks worse or the same to me.  If you watch programs that look better with 120hz, look elsewhere, but for me watching regular movies and TV shows it works well.  And it doesn't look like a soap opera half the time.The interface and remote are pretty easy to use - very little explanation and you can navigate stuff well.  Switching inputs is easy, channels, etc.  The remote works well and the TV responds well which isn't always the case.  Even my non-tech savvy mother in law figured it out without an explanation.  Setting it up was easy and the ports are well laid out with no issue getting to them or plugging something in.  I only need 2 HDMI inputs - one for Roku and one for the bluray.  The gaming system is hooked up through analog HD which is fine for me so most of the inputs are used and none are bad.  I know some may need more, but don't complain about it... it's clear in the write-up what ports this has.  Purchase an HDMI splitter for less than $10 if you NEED more.The bad - Most of the bad doesn't outweight the incredible value this TV offers and most of it is honestly typical to any TV today.To begin with - the speakers are terrible as they are on any TV.  TVs have thankfully gotten small but in return, the speakers on them must be small too.  Well, the physics of making noise that sounds good hasn't changed so the smaller speakers we have today sound worse than ever.  I wish they would remove them to make it even lighter, cheaper, and one less point of failure.  You can spend $100 on a regular stereo amp these days and another $100 for 2 bookshelf speakers and it will sound great.  It's honestly not a lot and works way better for you movies, music, etc.The next bad is a bit more annoying.  When you adjust the picture (brightness, color, contrast, tint) you MUST do it for each input.  I guess some people may have applications where adjusting each input can be beneficial but as far as I found out, LG didn't give me the option to at least set it the same for all inputs.  So, when I finally go the picture right for one setting, I had to write the numbers down and go punch it in for the next.  Keep the ability but give an option to 'apply to all'.The last is the worst one.  I know from reading the write-up it only had optical audio out but it's very odd this doesn't also have analog out.  Given most speaker systems in existance today only have analog inputs/outputs... one would think they could keep this on here.  I know it adds expense and this is a good value but the extra 14 cents it costs could easily be added into the price.  I know there are converters and such but that adds more cables and points of failure.  Heck, the TV keeps the old composite/component inputs... and that's died off a lot sooner than analog audio has.  Oh well.Overall - This is a great choice for a TV for your regular house or living room.  If you need an extra TV or yours quit on you, this is the one for a very good price.  The TV that was replaced was a 7 year old refurb Vizio that served me very well but was very warm, only 720p(only... haha still great picture), and was starting to make a buzzing noise whenever on which was the deal-breaker.  So, this thing is awesome being a bigger screen but a much smaller TV, more energy efficient (aka not a hot screen!), and a great value with all you need and nothing you don't.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "A solid compromise between price and quality", "Author": "mhoyson", "ReviewID": "RD6M4BPCNNO4T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV about 2 weeks ago from a local store. I did a lot of looking around before making my purchase. At my time of buying, this was the cheapest 42\" TV that I could find that had more than one HDMI input and was what I considered a name brand (not a TCL or Insignia, etc) I have an Xbox so I had no need to pay extra for a smart TV.Picture:The picture is certainly not the best that I've seen in a TV. That being said, it is noticeably better than my 4 year old Samsung 32\" that I was upgrading from. FIRST THING, turn off E saver. It will prevent you from getting the best possible picture. The TV comes with a picture wizard, which I made use of to help me get a better picture. You can also google what other people think the best settings are. I took a few of these and combined them with my picture wizard results to get me to where I am. Having the TV set at 16:9 actually cuts off a bit around the edge. I set it to Just Scan, and it's looking better.Note: I have not noticed any gaming lag when playing first person shooters.Sound: As stated elsewhere, not this TV's high point. That being said, it's really not terrible. To get it clear, I have auto volume on, clear voice off, sound mode = music, virtual surround on. If you like immersing yourself in a movie, you may want to have a separate audio system to run it through.Other: No swivel on the stand. Easy enough to move by yourself.

No smart features, no internet just a tv with a really good display. The contrast is superb, and the colors are vivid but not overdone. The full 1080p makes watching hi-def content a pleasure and for secondary use as a desktop monitor, there is no noticeable lag when gaming (even without using the tv's own \"game\" setting). I'm a little confused as to where the headphone jack is - there is definitely a jack that's the right size (next to the 2nd HDMI port) but above it is written \"Service Only\" and when I plug the headphones into that the only sound produced is a rhythmic beeping. With that said, considering its size, the tv's own speakers produce a healthy sound. Bass is admirable and treble is very crisp, with clear mids as long as you keep the volume below half (easy to do).

After messing with this for over an hour I had to put some folded pieces of paper under the back of the stand to make it not lean backwards (will be investing in a mount) but I did succeed in making it level from side to side.- The remote doesn't feel sturdy and the buttons are too hard to pressI won't put this in the cons section because most TVs today are like this, but I am sick of the glossy screens. I wish matte screens would start coming to TVs - they look so much better and the glare is significantly lower.I highly recommend this TV. The quality of the TV is enough but LG has proven itself to me many times. The last HDTV I had was Samsung and the two before that were Vizios, all of similar quality to this one (32-42\", 720-1080p, etc). The Samsung was lacking a couple things that should be considered standard, like an audio out port. Samsung customer service was poor, too. I was pleased with one of the Vizios but the picture quality on the other was very sub par, and I've heard that Vizio isn't consistent with their quality like LG.

For a \"dumb\" TV it is quite simply powerful and beautiful. Great picture, even out of the box. I did look online for the preffered picture settings and spent a few mins setting it up to optimum picture quality and am very pleased with this purchase. Dollar for Dollar its the best TV I own or have ever bought. It will get a lot of use in my household for movies, blu-ray, and gaming so it will definetly be put to the test. I also like the remote, very intuiative and compact. Only gripe is the bottom red light that is under the LG logo stays on after the TV is turned off (going from blue or white to red when powered off), not very annoying but would rather have it always off, maybe I can figure out a way to turn it off in the settings. Otherwise great purchase. Have not had any power or issues with the set turning itself off during use but will update if those issues present themselves, as a few customers have made light of that issue, fingers crossed and everything is great so far.Picture: 10/10Sound Quality: 9/10 (havent cranked it up all the way, but its in a small bedroom and the sound is plenty loud and clear even at 15 out of whatever it goes up to, other reviewers knock it for its less than theathre sound, for the price I think its more than adequate I dont expect at IMAX quality at this price point)Ease of Use: 9/10 (alot of picture settings are self explanatory but for others unless your an image quality enthusiast you have no idea what they mean and you will subsequently toy around till you get the picture you want)Aesthitics: 8/10 (would rather not have the red indicator light when powered off)Connectivity: 8/10 (would have prefered an audio out headphone connector to be available, and wish both hdmi ports were together but otherwise great set up)Remote: 10/10 (it serves it purpose, very good remote)Value for Price: 10/10 (feels worth every penny, picked it up at a reasonable price $274.99 through amazon prime, and had a very speedy delivery)Overall: 64/70 = 91% Solid A rating.

I live in a small studio apartment so this monitor pulls double duty as a television and a computer monitor. I bought the 32\" model and it's just perfect for watching TV from my bed or sitting close-up at my desk to get a really big picture.About 10% of its use is as a television. As a television it's great. The picture quality is sharp and the colors are vibrant. It's a full 1080p display, so HD channels look fantastic on this. The built-in speakers are fine, nothing to write home about. Basically what you'd expect for built-in speakers on a budget television. They produce sound, and that's fine with me.The other 90% of the time I use this as a computer monitor. I'm running my gaming PC directly into the TV with an HDMI cable. I couldn't be happier with this thing. Obviously it's not the same as some of the high-dollar gaming monitors but it works just fine for me. Having such a big screen (32 inches is HUGE for a computer monitor) is really breathtaking. I play games like Battlefield 4 at 1920x1080 resolution and it's just a gorgeous, gorgeous display. I'm also a college student so I do a lot of writing, and at the native 1920x1080 resolution I can fit two pages side-by-side on an MS Word document. This makes it really easy to skim through an essay for proofreading, etc. This is a big improvement from my old 1440x900 monitor which would only display a fraction of a single page. The extra 500 pixels running lengthwise make a really big difference. My only complaint with this TV as a computer monitor is the way it displays text, but that's not the TV's fault. 32 inches is a little bit too large to sharply display text at 1920x1080p. I can write essays and read forums just fine, but I find myself needing to get up and give my eyes a break every now and then because the text is just a little too fuzzy (and that's AFTER making the necessary overscan/sharpness adjustments). But I reiterate that's absolutely not the TV's fault; it's just the nature of the beast. The tradeoff you make for running 1080p at 32\" as a computer monitor is that you get really BIG and vibrant graphics in exchange for fuzzy text.So, overall: Five stars. My only complaint is the text issue, which isn't the TV's fault. If you're looking to use this as a computer monitor and your eyes are easily strained, don't buy it... Otherwise it's a great unit.By the way, I have not experienced the random shutting off problem that some other reviewers have complained about.

Anyway the main feature that I wanted was the ability to have it act as an alarm clock (\"On Time\"). I decided that 24\" was not large enough so I looked at the 29\" before seeing the 32\" at a lower price than the 29\" set. Again keep in mind that I am looking at the 530 model that has 720P/60Hz.They had the Samsung 32\" which was also on sale next to the LG 32LN530 set so I play around and I was able to adjust the picture quality to the same look as the Samsung which costs more. In reality the flesh tones were actually better on the LG 530 model, so I decided to purchase the LG530 which is 720P and I had not noticed that the box below this display was actually the 5300 series with 1080P. When the store rang this up the price was certainly much more expensive for this model (1080P versus 720P) so I balked at the price still thinking I was purchasing the lower resolution model. I took him over to where I picked up the box to show him that the price was advertised as less than $230 USD. He explained that the box I picked out was not the same as the model advertised but he reluctantly he called his manager and re-rung this TV as if I was purchasing the 530 model instead of the 5300. Needless to say I got an increadible deal plus they gave me a gift card for $15USD for some reason.So I took this home and set it up and yes the speakers are not very nice sounding if you do not change the settings. I set mine on the \"Music\" setting and fiddled with the trebble and bass so it sounds OK now. Remeber you have to set the picture and sound up for every input that you plan on using so it is not as simple. While it is true that it does not sound like an amped system, it is good enough for the bedroom and I can hear the voice tracks very well. This set has the feature that I wanted that allows me to use it as an alarm clock which is actually the reason that I purchased this model.In addition, I had an older ROKU that I had not used in a while so I added that to this TV making it a \"Smart TV\". Overall the quality is really good especially at the reduced price that I accidentally got it for.I am very happy with the picture quality and stock \"adjusted\" sound and you could use this as your main TV or a bedroom TV but in a living room or family room you might like it better with an amp system with some better speakers.Hope this lasts a while.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Nice TV", "Author": "Jill Lippert", "ReviewID": "R3NSQ6HSCH5WR8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its strange that 42\" seems small these days, but this is a nice TV and good for a smaller room.

What's more, with the fairly large picture, it's not remotely big or bulky; makes it easier for moving and what not.All in all, I certainly recommend this purchase if you're on the fence about it.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I think mine is a lemon", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R1TJLVM9Q9PNBY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all, I like the size and features of this T.V. I've been a huge fan of Lg's and that's why I went with this line up.That being said I think I may have gotten a lemon, or at least I hope I did because this T.V. is wholly sub-par in every category of operation.First off the sound quality is terrible.  Not that I expect great sound out of two 10 watt speakers but the voices shouldn't not sound distorted and high pitched.  After playing with some of the sound settings I found that \"sport\" mode is tolerable, but everything else just sounds wrong.Secondly the image quality is way below expectations.  The T.V. shows horrible whites and the blacks are really only black.  I had to turn a movie off last night in disgust because the dark scenes were just a black screen.  I could see movement on the screen but no detail.  I've worked with the calibration and the only way to see any detail of a dark scene is to go with \"vivid\" which makes anything that has color look distorted and the light parts of the image just a glare.  I have a small LED-lit Lg T.V. in my bedroom and I have no problem seeing these scenes with great clarity, no matter what setting I use so I know it's not just the technology that is failing here, it's either a bad T.V. or a bad line up of T.V.'s.Lastly my wife notices considerable motion blur during faster scenes.  I can't falut the T.V. for this because it is only designed with a 60hz refresh rate, and the research I've done does say that motion blur is an issue with t.v's larger than 32\" that are only 60hz.  I don't notice the blur myself.Just a few notes on design, this is a direct lit LED t.v. so dont expect a super slim design.  This t.v. is actually thicker than a plasma I just bought.  Also there are only 2 HDMI ports, this isn't an issue for me but it might be for some people.I gave the T.V. three stars because I recognize that it could just be my T.V. that is bad and not every LN 5300 out there.

I can't really say why but I decided on the LG. Maybe it's because that's the TV I have, and it's lasted longer than any other TV I've had.I did have to go through the picture wizard a couple times when I first set it up to adjust the sharpness, brightness, contrast, and color balance. At first there was a faint outline around everything, giving the picture a slightly embossed look. After tweaking, however, everything is sharp, bright, and clear. I also had to adjust the Windows sound properties to make sure the sound wasn't trying to go through the HDMI (I have my own speakers and sound card TYVM!).I love it! There's no streaking, no ghosting or tearing, it's totally immersive sitting on my desk, feels like I'm in an IMAX theater. Movies, games, web browsing, everything looks fantastic on it.

Our last tv, from a different company, was also a 42'' but that base was very heavy and sturdy. This base had me worried. We noticed there were 3 options in the manual on how to brace the tv to avoid falling.Option 1.) This option required a hole being drilled into my tv hutch so the tiny screw they provided could be screwed though the cheap plastic base and into my hutch. That was not going to happen.Option 2.) This option required a large hole be present in my tv hutch to loop a cord through that would then be attached to the back of the tv. My hutch did not come with a hole like that and I was not going to put one there.Option 3.) This option would not ruin my tv hutch and seemed the best way to go. All this option required was a trip to Lowe's to purchase 2 eye screws to attach to the back of the tv, rope or cord to tie through the eye screws and secure to 2 'L' shaped anchors that we would bolt in the wall. This would have been fine, but Lowe's does not carry the size eye screw that is needed for this tv.The sound quality was horrible, imo. We knew it would need some adjustment out of the box.

My only guess is that it was partially sticking out of a door somewhere on a truck and rain got to it. When I opened it the TV itself appeared to be dry since there is a tick lay of styrofoam protecting it.I already had a LG blu ray player and I was surprised the remote worked with this TV so that was an added plus.

Speakers sound like they belong on a low cost TV which is fits the price, but the quality of the picture exceeds expectations.  I'd give it 5 stars but for one very anoying missing feature:  Instead of shutting off or going into low power mode when there is not input signal, the set constantly displays a message stating the obvious.  This is a terible waste of power and very bright and anoying in a dark room after the program source has been shut off.  At the very least, there should be a menu option to enable auto-power-off.  There is no excuse for missing this critical feature.  The microprocessor inside obviously detects that there is nothing to display so it could easilly turn off after a few seconds.

Honestly, to do much better I feel I'd have to get up into the $2000 range for those are the only other TVs that caught my eye. The software for this is also extremely intuitive and has a nice selection of presets to choose from - or you can create your own customized settings. The nice thing is that, as soon as you select an option in the menu, you immediately see the change on the screen right behind the menu. No need to select 'ok' and exit the menu to see the results of the menu selections. Love it! I also have an LG front loading washing machine.

Many are reporting issues with turning on/off, but I can't comment on this just yet (and hopefully will never need to!).  Compared to my old TV, which was AWFUL, this one is awesome.  The picture is clear (Dr. Phil never looked so great) and I don't have to turn on the surround sound to hear what's going on.  Maybe because my last TV was so bad, my expectations were low for this one, but I'm happy with this TV for the price.  When I bought it, it was only around $365, which was much lower than the $428 I saw it for at Wal-Mart.The one thing I didn't like about this TV was the available AV hook-ups (which, I admit, is my own fault for not fully researching prior to purchase).  I don't have much in the way of HDMI equipment, but I do have a Wii, a DVD player, and a Roku--all things that require the red/yellow/white cords.  This TV doesn't allow you to hook up all these devices at once (it has two HDMI ports, and I think just one component and one AV port).  I bought a box that turns one AV hook-up into four, so that took care of the problem, but I was disappointed when I first got the TV and had to keep unplugging/plugging in devices to use the Wii or watch movies.Another thing is the time it takes for the TV to turn on.  It seems like it takes longer than normal.  The red light kind of flashes a little bit and then a few seconds later it turns on.  It's long enough that sometimes I get scared that it's NOT going to turn on, but it always does.Hopefully, this TV won't go out like it has for some other reviewers I've seen.

My husband came upstairs a little later and it was on.  That same night, the tv was randomly cycling on and off and would not stay on very long.  The standby light on the tv would flash on and off for a few minutes, then it would go off and the tv would come on, and just when I was settling in to fall asleep it would go off again.  Starting to drift asleep, on it would come, disturbing me again.  I had to wait for it to stay on long enough to track down the remote in the dark and turn it off.

After I read their guidelines I was unable to determine what was wrong and since LG didn't spell out what I did wrong, I can only assume they don't want to hear something not slanted extremely favorable to them so now the product gets a 3 star rating based on the LG manufacturer and puts me into question whether or not I will continue to do business with them.That said, here is my original review post:With the consumer culture in a capitalistic society so desirous of purchasing new technology even when it's not absolutely needed, being so compelling, I was more than hesitant in spending my hard earned way in life for frivolous TV upgrades until I had to.  I finally made my first HDTV buy in September 2013, when one of my SDTV's finally died.  The room for the TV was not my main viewing room and I spend my money based on needs before wants so I didn't get what I would really want, but rather what I needed.With this first HDTV purchase, I chose the LG name by reputation and past experiences with this manufacturer.  I have now had this TV for ~4.5 months and I am satisfied for the price I paid.  The quality, durability has met expectations and the HD resolution is what one would expect for the specifications.The Pro's far exceed the Con's and while I would rather not emphasize the negatives, they are the details that follow.  Regardless of these negatives, I would still recommend and purchase another LG product (except for maybe my #1 complaint below).1. The technology to un-mute the sound when adjusting the volume DOWN is one of the most annoying and pet peeves I have.  With capitalistic commercialism tactics increasing the volume during commercials, I always chose to mute the volume.  Since the volume can be so annoyingly raised for commercials, over what was previously being heard, I often want to lower the volume and un-mute it at the now lowered volume.  This LG product does not support this.  It un-mutes the volume as soon as either volume down (or up) is changed.  This problem is exacerbated in its severity because of the #2 problem that I've stated below.2. The volume level quality is reasonable, but power to volume ratio is very poor.  What I mean is that on certain programming or streaming where input volume levels coming in are already low, this LG product does not have enough power to compensate.  Thus when adjusting the volume from 0 to 25% there is enough noticeable change to accommodate the level desired, but when increasing the volume between 25% and 100% there is very little change to accommodate the level desired.  So when a low input volume single is delivered, I often have to increase the TV volume to 75%-100% to get close to my desired output and find it to be still not adequate.3. The remote control layout is absolutely horrible, messy, over cluttered, and just bad.  The placements of the key/most used buttons are out of phase with common sense.  The mute button is mixed in with several other buttons that I don't want to be near when I'm seeking to mute the sound for example.  The \"enter\" button is down at the bottom of the keypad numbers.  There are several buttons that bring up the main menu, but just focused on the title of what's on the button.  Wasted buttons and space since it's all the same menu and if one really wants the menu, then using up/down arrows to get to the focus of one's desire is all that is needed, IMHO.  Catastrophic FAIL for the UI engineer who designed this.4. The favorite's button provides a list of the set favorites, but there is no mechanism to hit one button to move to the next or previous favorite in the list.  Since the favorite button brings up a list, you then have to move to the bottom of the controller to use the up/down arrow keys to scroll the list and then hit the button to \"enter\" the selection.  Way too many buttons to press and find when in the dark lying in bed at night.5.

(I actually waited to write this review for a while to see if it got any easier as I got used to it, but I've had it for a couple of weeks now and it's not improved at all).Also, the selection menu is extremely large and bright, which is annoying for two reasons.  When I am watching TV in bed in the dark, I have the brightness and contrast turned down so the TV isn't so bright.  However the menu is so big and bright that it's very jarring to use it in the dark such as to set the sleep timer.  Secondly, when I am selecting a different picture setting the menu obscures the picture to where I can't really tell what my selection will look like until after I close the menu.  I'm sure I'll memorize the names after a while but in the meantime it's annoying.Otherwise I like the TV, the picture is crisp and I've not had any problems with it.

When you have an issue you get lead around in circles by their support teams blaming everything else but their hardware! And when proven to be their issue they do not honor their warranty!!!I simply would not trust buying LG TV's due to their overall quality.Over Seas support who you can't understand that doesn't know how to support their hardware.Inability to take responsibility for their poor workmanship.If you buy a LG TV be prepared for a fight and if you are outside the 30-day return policy if you have ANY ISSUE!!!", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG misrepresents product", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R2LQO8R9RC6JTZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I replaced a perfectly good tv because I wanted one with headphone jack to use in my workout room.  I live chatted with a person at LG and asked specifically if this unit had a headphone jack and was told that it did, and that the 5300 series is the only series with a headphone jack.  Guess what?  No headphone jack.  I have not even taken the protective film off the tv yet nor hooked it up, so I don't know how well it works, but I am disgusted that I didn't get what I expected.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$249.00", "Features": "Refresh Rate: 60Hz (Native); Motion Clarity Index: 120 (Effective)\nBacklight: LED (Direct LED)\nSmart Functionality: No\nDimensions (W x H x D):  TV without stand: 29.1'' x 17.2\" x 3.1'', TV with stand: 29.1'' x 19.6'' x 8.2''\nInputs: 2 HDMI, 1 USB, 1 RF, 1 Component, 1 Composite, 1 Digital Audio Out (optical)\nYou won't believe your eyes.
