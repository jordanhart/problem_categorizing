After adjusting the picture, it looks amazing, for the size.  I was able to get this TV for $129.99 on here thanks to Amazon's TV price match guarantee, and the shipping was amazing.  I'm a Prime member but even I was impressed at how fast it took to get to my house.  From order to delivery, was lest than 24 hours, and I chose 2 day shipping so two thumbs up to amazon for that.  The only con, is that there is one stuck pixel that stays blue when the tv is on, but it's only a minor problem, not worth the hassle of returning though.  All in all Great TV!", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "I wouldn't buy again", "Author": "Hammy", "ReviewID": "R3RID77U4MP3OF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros: Great resolution, great brightness and contrast.  High definition material really has that LCD \"pop\".Cons: Terrible motion handling with any fast movement.  Regular 60 hz is simply atrocious with tons of judder and artifacting during fast movement. Turning on 120hz helps (not completely though) but I hate the soap opera effect.  Also, no tint control which is ridiculous. There is a definite red tint bias and you are powerless to change it.Bottom line: If you are not discerning and just want a large hd tv go for it. Otherwise, stay away.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Haier TV from Amazon", "Author": "Caroline Rohrbach", "ReviewID": "R324R9S2JZXAP0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice size and shape for my needs.

We don't have cable or watch that much TV, and bought this flat screen mainly to watch movies and play the occasional video game (we do use an HD antenna to get a few local channels of free TV).  As this is our first flat screen TV we were not aware that an additional sound system of some sort is necessary, and we did have to purchase a sound bar to go with it.  Overall, the picture is pretty good although you have to be right in front of the screen to have the best view.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super happy with it.

It seems the channel either zooms up/down if you hold the button or changes to the next channel and you have to wait a long pause for the channel to appear before you can change it again.  Not surfer friendly.Also the channel number in the upper right corner of the screen is a very small font.  I have fairly good eyesight, but can't read the number from bed.  What is strange is the box that appears with the number in it is 2x bigger than the number, but the number size is not configurable in the settings.Nice picture and sound for the price.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "not everything works", "Author": "Jon N", "ReviewID": "R2ADL9FGQ2MCGH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I will say the picture is good on the TV, but that's about where the good items end.
