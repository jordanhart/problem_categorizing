I thought that would make things a lot easier but there are so many choices. I started with a Westinginghouse 40\" with a built-in dvd player. I didn't think it was too bad so I tried it out for about 25 days through my retailer's 30 day return policy. As I got down to the final days, I began doing some more research and found that the Samsung's were rated fairly high for performance. Wow, what a difference! With the Westinghouse I figured that I was going to have to settle for a so-so analog off-air picture on any lcd but boy, was I wrong. The Samsung LN-S4041D is a fantastic set and I would highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind paying a little more for a whole lot more! I really struggled with spending that kind of money until I tried the Samsung out and now I am more than satisfied!

Cowan \"Dolomight\"", "ReviewID": "R1MLK6M6P2GD3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking at 40\" LCD HDTV's for 2 months now and decided on this set. After pricing it at many retail stores and online retailers Amazon beat everyone by $500, no tax and free 3-5 day shipping. I received the TV 3 days after I ordered. The TV is light and took about 15 minutes to set-up. The only thing I am not crazy about is the base does not swivel. I plan on wall mounting so it's not an issue, but the base does feel cheap. Sound is great even without a surround system.I have Time Warner HD service as well as an air HD aentenna from Radio Shack. I can not believe the image and coor quality of this set for under 2k. It is simply amazing. Unfortunately it has ruined any non-hd broadcast. The difference between HD and non-HD is unbearable. DVD's even look poor compared to HD broadcasts, I'll definately be buying a HD-DVD player as soon as I can get one.Bottom line, this is the best deal for the size and quality, I am blown away!", "Date": "May 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "Chriscle \"chrisgbgsu\"", "ReviewID": "R2CK6YJV9DFKEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After about 6 weeks of researching LCD TVs I decided on this model and I am very satisfied with it. I started out looking at 32\" inchers but realized that 40\" is significantly bigger for a marginal price increase. I also knew I wanted to go Samsung all the way because the are supposedly the best but I'd just like to mention most of the Westinghouses I saw looked just as good for significantly less money. So, yes, I bought the name. After all the time I spent looking into these it really came down to a few Samsungs the LNS4096D, LNS4095D, LNS4051D, and the one I bought.There were 2 reasons that I ruled out the 3 that I ended up choosing against. Money wasn't one but I'll point out here that the 96D is about $800 more while the 95D is about $650 and the 51D around $200. All of these TVs have speakers on the bottom and the 95 & 96 have little panels that serve to reflect the sound out to the viewer. In my experience with adjusting the volume at pretty much every TV in best buy these TVs just didn't have the sound quality that this one has. Sound wasn't a very high priority of mine going in but once I heard what I did it did become a concern. I also like the look of the speakers on the front it makes the TV look bigger.The biggest and ultimately overwhelming aspect that turned me off on the ones that I didn't pick is their gloss finish. I know that might sound bizarre but read the amazon reviews of these other TVs and you'll see the owners even mention that as the a negative (one even saying he would return the tv if shipping wouldn't be such a hassle). I had ultimately wanted the 96D because of the 1080p capability but having seen it in person I couldn't get over the gloss finish. It really makes these TV's look like [...].I have mostly spoke about why I didn't take the others making it sound like I just settled on the wonderful LNS4041D by default but this isn't the case at all. 90% of the reason I wanted an HDTV is to play my xbox 360 in HD so visual performance is a top priority. This TV delivers. The picture looks incredible. It is every bit as good as the other TVs that I spend hours comparing in the stores. It has a 3000:1 contrast ratio (which means the difference in contrast between the brightest white and the darkest black for those of you who don't know). 3000:1 is very good it is surpassed by some of the other newer samsungs but TRUE 3000:1 is among the higher end of the market. The TVs that make outrageous claims like 10,000:1 are using slanted data based on certain modes that aren't practical for the everyday user. 2 HDMI inputs is a very definite convenience that we will appreciate more down the road as the cable companies and other devices use this as their main connection port. I don't have HD broadcasting from my cable company as of yet and this thing broadcasts the regular signal incredibly. Also this TV has a presence to it. When I round the corner from my kitchen to my living room it flies out at me - this thing commands attention. I wanna show it off to my friends. Let me also point out by ordering it on amazon I got it at about $380 cheaper than best buy. I used my amazon credit card for x3 the points which I will probably use toward a surround sound system. All with free shipping.Lastly, let me comment on the shipping. I chose not to join amazon prime and get 2 day $3.99 shipping because I don't like to join things that I'm just going to have to cancel in a month. I got free super saver shipping that told me it would arrive in 5-9 business days. After the order completed I got an email that told me I could expect it between Nov.30 - Dec. 8th. 14 to 24 days after I ordered it! I was pretty upset. However, I got an email sometime during the next day saying that it had been shipped. There was a link to Eagle's website (the shipping company that amazon uses whom I'd never heard of before them). The link showed me just where the package was and it also had the expectation date of December 8th. The TV arrived in my area just 4 days after I had placed the order and was delivered 6 days after my order! It would have been a day sooner had I returned their first call in time. The delivery guys brought it up the stairs to my apartment and set it where it needed to go and I was good to go. I would also like to mention when deciding on what type of shipping to get you should check if there is an amazon distribution center near you before you order. I noticed after the fact that there was one just one state over in PA and that may be why I got my TV so soon and at times you'll notice people who've said with the super saver shipping their products didn't come for weeks.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very good TV and I love it", "Author": "J. Park", "ReviewID": "R37OC31KF5OEOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my parents about a year ago.  I did a lot of research, as usual, since this is a big purchase.  It was either this TV or Sony Bravia.  At the end of the day, Samsung and Sony use the same LCD pannels.  They have a joint venture called S-LCD (for Samnsung's expertise in LCD and Sony's know-how on TV's) which supplies all LCD pannels used by Sony and Samsung.  I figured this is a good thing for both companies and TV's from both should be in a compatible quality.  I furthered my research based on this and looked at all specs, functions, and prices.  I paid a little less than $2,000 for Samsung TV and it was a great purchase.  I would have been happy with a Sony TV, but Samsung seems to be up and coming thesedays (and recent deterioration of Sony products), even beyond Sony, at least in my opinion.  Anyway, my parents love this TV and my brother mastered how to manipulate all the functions.  Clear picture, no lag time, fast responding, good angle, very light, easy to install and use, etc.  I stop by at my parents' time to time, and I love this TV.  I am planning to buy a TV soon, but price is falling sharply, so I might wait a little bit.  But I will buy another Samsung LCD.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "You will be happy with this product.", "Author": "Eugene Yee", "ReviewID": "R4GGZ119KXDZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, so you're trying to find a TV and you can't debate between plasma or LCD HDTV.  You're mixed up & broken between screen resolutions and screen sizes.  You're worried about details involving burn-in, contrast-ratios, and which brand is the best.I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.Face it, you're basically going to have to do the research by yourself, or simply take advice from people you really trust.***** ***** ***** ***** *****Here are the reasons why I bought this TV:It's LCD HDTV.  Plasma may have better contrast ratios, and may provide smoother picture but I am a gamer.  I play games that involve overhead displays (health bars, ammo meters, etc...) that are essentially frozen on the screen.  Buying a plasma would only provide agonizing burn-in with those regions.It's Samsung.  Samsung produces really amazing LCD HDTV's.  If it were a plasma, I'd definitely opt for a Panasonic.It's 40\".  I originally wanted a 42\" TV, but then realized that I'd be spending several more hundreds of dollars for 2 more inches.  Reality check---I recently graduated from college and I am broke.  40\" is still very big (and quite a luxury) for a college graduate.The resolution---it maxes out at 1080i, I know.  Higher numbers are wonderful and all, but usually end up yielding higher PRICES (at least $[...] more).  If you really think about it, there isn't much that outputs 1080p, besides the PS3.  If you didn't know already, the PS3 is $[...], and is probably the cheapest BluRay Disc player on the market.Besides the PS3, your current DVDs & gaming-consoles & HD Cable Television will not improve, since they are currently maxed out at 480p - 1080i.  To me, 1080p is not big enough of a technological jump for me to shell out another $[...].The price.  Of course you have been shopping around.  You know that this TV's price is pretty darn cheap.  Unless you're gonna find yourself a magical mail-in-rebate, or some type of employee discount, this is gonna be THE DEAL for you.  Think about it---Amazon's free shipping.  No tax (depending on where you live, i guess).  This is the price that you pay!!!The one *one* complaint I have regarding this TV is that there is only one Component input (RGB).  As a result, I plug in my Nintendo Wii via Composite (yellow-cable for video) and my XBox 360 into my Component.This basically forces me to purchase an HDMI cable for my XBox 360, so that I can up my Wii to Component cables.All-in-All, this is really a great deal.  Amazon is a very reliable source, and the TV is outstanding.", "Date": "March 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pros vs Cons: Samsung LNS4041D 40\" Wide LCD HDTV", "Author": "Jason R. Michaud \"JD\"", "ReviewID": "RJI7FMDVBPGI1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:If you are looking for a high quality, reliable 720p LCD with gorgeous gaming potential and dramatic HD - this is the unit for you! I'm sure by now you know the differences between LCD and Plasma. More than likely you want a sharp HDTV with great viability (about 170+ degrees), and much easier to hang on a wall weighing in at about 40 lbs (half the weight of a comparable Plasma). The ATSC tuner drives the picture and compensates for low dull pictures and removes haziness. Screen preforms well with fast gaming in HD with Xbox 360. If you are going to be using the speakers they sound great and even simulate surround sound.Cons:The remote must be within about 20 degrees of center. So if you actually use the remote or use your cable/satellite remote to control the volume, you won't be able to do it from everywhere in a big room unless you are almost directly in front of the screen.Image refresh on dark scenes and fast motion sports is not as good as plasma. Black scenes will have a 1 or 2 second memory until refreshed with a new scene. Closeups of turf or grass and fast motion on the playing field leave a bit to be desired vs. plasma.Conclusion:If you need an all around flat panel 720p (not 1080) HDTV with brilliant color and good sound without the worry of burn-in from a plasma then this is a great choice.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Even late in 2006, this is an awesome buy", "Author": "Chris C.", "ReviewID": "RY0KDCH1WWMPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I'll be the odd man out here:  I didn't purchase this tv through Amazon.  I heard too many horror stories about how the shipping was a hassle with delivery time windows.  Most worrisome, though, were the bad stories about the warranty on the tvs.  You're basically putting your tv's life in the hands of the mfg's.  I didn't want that so i bought mine from BestBuy and got their warranty which works great since I live right down the road and a 4 yr contract was only a few hundred dollars.  So, the tv itself rocks!  It's not the latest model (at the time I wrote this) but it much more elegant looking than the shiny plastic new model right now.  Picture's great, cost is amazing (mine with 2 HDMI cables, warranty, high powered surge protector AND upconverting DVD player was only $2500 from BestBuy).

I finally decided what fit the bill as the most ideal, perfect tv for me.  At first I thought the dlp.  It was so much cheaper than lcd or plasma's in the same size, so why not?  Well I don't like dlp because the rainbow effect and if you ask me the blacks were good but not great.  There's also an annoying lag when playing games with these tv's.  Do yourself a favor and don't consider dlp's for gaming.  LCD is the way to go.  Plasmas have too much of a burn-in risk.  Would you wanna break a 2,000 dollar toy because you want to play games on it?  So obviously lcd was the ideal tv I was looking for.  The picture on it is perfect right out of the box.  For watching DVD's I use movie mode.  For OTA or DTV I use either dynamic or standard settings, which both look fantastic.  Oh and let me just say that the quality of the over the air hdtv channels is amazing.  HD channels show as clear as the sky and they are totally free!! What a deal!  And if you don't know already in 2009 everyone will be broadcasting 100% digital, HDtv for all you folks who are still deciding whether they should make the move or not.

I use it with regular cable, HD cable set-top box, DVD, and VCR inputs.  From the set-top box, I am running both S-video and component cables.  I have yet to try an HDMI cable.  I get a good picture with regular cable or VCR inputs, a better picture with with DVD or S-Video, and the best picture with component cables.  I briefly experimented with an amplified antenna before going to HD service from Comcast, but I could only receive 2 HD channels and they were both from PBS.  (HD from Comcast only costs me an extra $6.50 a month which allows me to receive ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, and PBS in high definition.  I discovered this option after some searching of the Comcast web site when I balked at having to pay $50 a month for the digital-channel package in order to receive any HD channels.)By big complaint is that I cannot use closed captioning when receiving the best HD signals via component cable or HDMI.  This is why I had to add the compromise S-video input.  So if I need to understand the dialog, I watch HD using the S-vido signal and settle for a better picture.  If I am watching golf or football, I use the component signal to get the best picture.  Let me hasten to add that this captioning limitation is not specific to Samsung. From what I have been able to find on the web, this limitation happens because of how HDTVs process component or HDMI inputs.  I am bringing up this issue because I was caught by surprise.  So, if you regularly use closed-captioning, be prepared to compromise, and don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what you have set up or connected wrong when you can't closed captioning.I have been using this TV for about six months with no problems so far.  We really like the sleek black, space-saving design of this LCD HDTV.This TV has a lot of features which tends to make it complex to set up if you want to go beyond factory presets.  For me, I am willing to spend the time and effort to make adjustments to picture settings that produce a more pleasing picture to my eye.  Also, I am using this TV with a surround-sound system which adds to the comlexity on the one hand and negates some of the options such as automatic volume control on the other.The bottom line is that I am very satisfied with this HDTV, and would recommend it or similar models.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "burned twice", "Author": "lindamarie", "ReviewID": "RUNUET8BODK9V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for a christmas present for my husband.

From my perspective the sony had a slightly better picture, but at $1,800 not THAT much better.  Plus the samsung has a 2nd hdmi input and PIP.

The energy saving feature allows you to step down the brightness of the fluorescent tube, and for really life like blacks go with medium during the night and maybe just step it up to low in the daytime if you've got a really bright sunlit room.I did have one stuck pixel on my screen but i haven't bothered to return it as it absolutely isn't noticeable from viewing distance and it may get \"un-stuck\" over time (it isn't dead).One reviewer commented that the left speaker vibrated on occasion and this was very irritating.  I had the exact same issue, but resolved it completely by going into my set top box (motorola from comcast) and turning the compression from heavy to standard.My first flat screen purchase (although i do have a DLP projector) and overall i think good value.

they did and they somehow already had my phone number.  however, you have to remember that this company has a somewhat limited delivery schedule (at least in my area).  some days they would be out in a different city and had no openings for delivery to my area.  they ended up delivery on a thursday with a window from 10am to 2pm, good thing i had someone there to accept delivery or i would have had to wait for several more days and they don't work on saturday.  it arrived within 6 days of ordering, which is well ahead of what amazon predicted.  the tv arrived in a large box with black muck on the bottom.  the workers also arrived with black muck on their shoes, they didn't unpack it either.  good thing is that the tv arrived in perfect condition.at first the picture looked horrible with standard analog cable.  artifacts were everywhere and was very grainy. however I ran my video essentials dvd (over components) to adjust the color, sharpness, contrast and brightness.  this made a huge difference.i have a series 2 tivo, it's best output is s-video.  it doesn't look that great when i play back recordings in basic, it looks like VHS, but that was expected.  if you have a series 1

first i had a problem that i would get an all blue or all red picture, the problem was that i needed to switch the output on the dvd player (phillips dvp642) to progressive over components.  i'm not sure if it's worth the money to buy an upscaling dvd player, i thing your money is better saved for a blu-ray/HD-dvd player.i have a nintendo wii hooked up to it also with composite cables.  it looks decent enough over composite, that i will not upgrade to component cables.  also, i only have one component input and don't want to buy a component switcheri also have my pc hooked up through the vga

The picture is absolutely terrific and being a semi-ludite (ie: cheap) I have neither cable nor satellite. I had a new HD capable antenna mounted last fall when my house was re-roofed and I live in a major market, less than 10 miles from the transmission towers. So, just from the HD broadcast signal I have an incredible picture with this set's integrated ATSC tuner. In fact I gained 6 to 8 new stations that I never had before because of the multiple signals a station can broadcast by use of the digital spectrum. I had checked CNET, PriceScan, Price Grabber and a couple of other sites for revues by both pros and purchasers and taken a trip to Best Buy to view the picture before I settled on this Samsung model. There was only one seller I found in my research with a price better than Amazon, but that seller had a lousy BBB rating and scary customer reviews. So I felt the extra $40 for Amazon was well worth it since I've done very satisfactory business with Amazon in the past. I still saved well over $400 (not counting taxes) from what I would have paid at a big box outlet. If I have any complaint it's that the remote has a very narrow path, you have to be pointing the remote pretty close to dead on to the set's sensor when you use it.

I started to check out the tv's to pass some time and came across the Samsung LNS4041D and really was blown away by the quality and price. I started asking the saleperson about the TV and began to get a complete education on LCD VS Plama and HD, HDMI connections along with digital vs analog (which I had at the time). I went home and told my parents what a great deal it was, we both had heard that Samsung was one of the leaders in LCD's so we went back to Best Buy the next day and discovered they were discontinued and an additional 10% off.  We bought two right then and there for $1120. I have been very pleased. I had to get use to the 16.9 ratio on the analog channels because they have a very stretched look that seems distorted (especially if you are use to a tube tv) however, the HD channels and movies that are broadcasted in widescreen HD is such a joy to watch it makes it worth while to have purchased the TV.Both my parents and I have experienced a popping and cracking noise thru the speakers. My parents returned theirs and got a different Samsung but I went on line and researched others with this problem. I found thru different reviews on Amazon's site that there are people experiencing the same problem with many new LCD/Plasma's (not just Samsung). A few recommended a power conditioner because apparently there could be a slight power issue thru the electrical outlet.  The power conditioner sends a clean smooth current to the tv w/out interruption. A bit advanced for me but the laymen way I explained it was the only was I understood. I went to Best Buy and purchased a \"Monster Power Strip\" for $80.00. It was a bit pricey but after I realized what it did (essentially removes \"dirty\" power and is also a surge protector that warrants up to $150,000 of connected equipment) I didnt think so.

The carrier, Eagle, also did a wonderful job with the delivery, making certain the box and everything inside was in perfect condition before the driver left. That alone says a LOT about the company.Now on to the TV, this 40\" is larger in terms of over-all height and width than most other 40\" LCD's, but it's a good thing. Really makes a bold statement once you get up on to a wall. The image quality with my 5 year old standard Pioneer DVD player (RCA connections) was not to great, so I upgraded to a Samsung up-converting DVD player model 860 with an HDMI cable and was super pleased with the image results. I didn't think it would actually make a difference, as most of the reviews I read it wouldn't, but take my word for it - it did! The thirty or so HD channels that come through my dish are also very clean and crisp. I really don't have another LCD or Plasma to compare it to, but the colors and contrast seem to be on the ball. Standard channels come in OK, seem to be a little more pixilated, but then again I guess that's expected and not really a drawback of the TV. Sound is good and volume level is decent. It definitely doesn't WOW you. A little more power would have helped. I recommend some sort of surround sound home theater setup for true movie theater like experience. Menu functions and controls are as easy as you're gonna get. Took me a whole 5min to set everything up and figure what's what. The remote control is pretty basic, nothing fancy. One problem with it though, if you don't point it DIRECTLY at the bottom corner sensor on the TV (even with fresh new batteries) it sometimes doesn't register. I upgraded to universal remote, and that's proven to be much better in terms of range and control than the OEM unit.All in all I'm quite happy with this TV. None of the local electronic giants could even come close to amazon'a price with FREE shipping and NO tax! Even at it's cheapest, so called \"discounted price\", amazons price was still around $300 (+ tax) cheaper than if I had purchased it locally.If you're on the fence and don't know if this TV is worth the price its being offered at, don't wait much longer.

Evidently there is a danger of 'burn in' when you are watching something that is not being broadcast in HD, (which means that the picture doesn't extend to both sides of the screen), so if you are watching a regular show (read not HD) and you fall asleep, you might find yourself waking up hours later with the TV on and those black bars on either side of the screen becoming a more permanent fixture.The TV was virtually plug and play - although you can adjust color, etc, we haven't had to, even on the bright blue menu of Direct TV.  Though it can be hung on the wall, we don't have ours set up that way, but we are still enjoying the convenience of the side video inputs.The only 'negative' part of the entire searching, shopping, enjoying HD experience was the week long variance between when Amazon said we would probably receive delivery and when we actually did receive it.  It took a little over 2 weeks to go from ordering it to getting it and it was ironic that I bought our new HD dvd player on the day that Amazon had initially  said that we would receive the TV and the dvd player still came 2 days before the TV did.The sound that comes from the built in speakers is quite adequate, and we didn't even bother with synchronizing our home theater system with the new satellite box and TV for the first 2 weeks that we had the TV - and it was only because I did miss hearing things from the home theater speakers behind the couch that it even became an issue.All in all, a great buy and probably the most TV you can get for that kind of money.", "Date": "May 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "The BEST TV EVER!!!", "Author": "Schakia Eze \"SE1\"", "ReviewID": "RTYU5RM4D18SR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE this TV and would carry it out on my back if there were a fire at my house.

I bought my tv to play Xbox 360 and I was blown away by the graphics. The sound is average at best so I hooked it up to my surround and sounds superb. The options screen on the tv are easy to follow and browsing is easy. TV has a video game component that makes the games look super real. I have dishnetwork and the channels look average I guess I need HDTV. Everything looks a bit scretched at 16:9.

Only knock on the product would be the remote control. Didn't make sense to me to have the numbers at the top of the long sleek remote, but have the enter button at the bottom. Unless you have big hands, then it  shouldn't be a problem for you.I don't have HD cable programming as of yet, but the picture is decent still. DVD's weren't that good using regular RCA cables, but once I switched to a Monster Cable video component cable (my current dvd player doesn't have hdmi outputs), the difference was like night and day. I can only imagine how great the picture will be once I purchase a player with HDMI output. I thought the picture quality was fantastic, but after reading some reviews on this site, I'm going to adjust the video settings and see if I can't an even better picture.In closing, I'd recommend this product to any potential buyer.
