Same question I had when I looked at this television.  I did some research and this is a US based company (California).  Their TVs can can be found in Sears, K-Mart, BJs, TigerDirect, etc.Overall, the TV was a good deal for the bargain price I paid ($648 through Amazon). The picture quality is average and unit has several adjustments so you can get the picture to a level you desire.  The presets are decent, but do need a little tuning for personal preference.Pros: * Price * Easy SetupCons: * Speakers - not the best sound, but acceptable.Note: I did have a problem with my first unit. When I turned it on there were two LEDs that were burnt in.  I contacted Amazon and they arranged for an exchange.  The delivery company they use will come out, unpack and help you do basic setup of the TV.  They will pack up the return unit and take it away for you.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Buy for the Price", "Author": "Mario", "ReviewID": "RBD52Z9FWO5XN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good image, super thin and light, good product. easy to use, good price, I really liked my purchase and I will be buying this brand", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Love It", "Author": "Ruth L.

We got a great deal on Black Friday from East Coast Appliances. It's super thin, light weight and looks beautiful mounted. The glass stand it comes with is nice too. The hook ups on the back aren't designed the best but we made them work. There are 3 HDMI hook ups along with component, no fiber optic though. The picture is amazing but the sound not so much. Thank goodness we have our Sony Surround Sound. Great bang for the buck so far! Hopefully we won't have to deal with customer service for Seiki like many others have and our TV will continue to work :/ we'll see!!", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,249.99", "Features": "55-Inch diagonal LED screen with 1920 x 1080 panel resolution and 178 degree x 178 degree viewing angles\nBrightness: 35-400 cd/m2\nContrast Ratio: 3000-5000:1\nResponse time: 8 Mins\n3HDMI and VGA input (15-Pin D-Sub)", "Name": "Seiki SE551GS 55-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143FA7NUTL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008FY2Z4C"}}
