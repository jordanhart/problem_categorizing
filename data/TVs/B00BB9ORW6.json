{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Image, Sound, Features, and Value", "Author": "D.R.L.", "ReviewID": "R3IUBUNBO01LEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon has provided an extensive \"Product Description\" (taken from LG promotional literature) that outlines the myriad of features available on the LN5700 series of Smart TV's that became available in early 2013.  There is no point in reiterating that list of features, so my review will focus on customer experience.* SET UP: It took no time at all for a non-geek like me to set up the TV and the internet features.  As they say: just follow the instructions on the screen.* IMAGE QUALITY: I spent considerable time in a local electronics stores searching for the best buy in 42 inch smart TV's (needed to fit into a cabinet, therefore the size restrictions).  While there I surveyed other sizes of TV's just to get an idea of quality of different brands.  My overall impression: LG offers great quality for a reasonable price.  Indeed, their new LN5700 series is a great value throughout the line of sizes available (32\", 39\" 42\" 47\", 50\", and 55\").  Sizes 42\" through 55\" have TruMotion 120 Hz technology, which makes for great images during sports and action movies.  The 32\" and 39\" do not have the TruMotion feature and operate at 60 Hz refresh rate.  For those who prefer to turn off or adjust the impact of the TruMotion technology, that is easily done.  The LED backlighting, the Picture Wizard II feature, and Full HD 1080p resolution provide an exceptional image (better than any of the other brands I compared to while in the store).  Saturated (but not gaudy) colors, great contrast ratio, and sharp edge definition all contribute to a clear, crisp image.  The LN5700 has good off angle viewing performance and still looks good at angles around 30 degrees off center, unlike so many TV's that start to have the contrast degrade at 20 to 25 degrees.  The screen is matte, rather than glossy to help reduce glare and reflections.  There are a variety of pre-set color schemes you can chose from should you decide you like your images more vivid, etc.  There is an \"energy saving\" setting that adjusts the brightness of the picture according to the ambient light.  This feature can be set to off, minimum, medium, maximum, or auto.  I found the picture best to have this setting at off or minimum.* SOUND QUALITY: Many purchasers will run the sound through external speakers or sound bar, but even if you just want to use the build in speakers you will be pleased.  The set of stereo speakers are ported to the back and to the bottom of the TV.  This allows you to adjust the sound for wall-mounting or table-top standing.  I have my TV sitting in a cabinet and have the sound setting to the combined wall-mount + table-top setting; perhaps because of the enclosed nature of the cabinet, I find the sound more than acceptable.  In addition, the six available \"sound mode\" options and an equalizer help to fine tune the sound.  I use the \"Cinema\" sound option with the \"voice enhancement\" set at one.  This helps eliminate the background music from overwhelming the dialog.* SMART TV: The CPU and GPU have been upgraded for 2013 in the LN5700 series making for rapid response in the multiple Smart TV / Internet features and for gamers.  Reports are that the processor is 3 times faster than last years model, but I cannot make that direct comparison myself.  The LN5700 has built-in WiFi, a built-in Web browser, and a wide range of Smart TV options including all the premium applications such as Netflix, Hulu Plus, You Tube, Amazon apps (as of mid-August 2013), etc.  The Home Dashboard feature enables the TV to remember and list all the various applications you have downloaded and viewed on one convenient page.  There is also a dedicated button on the remote to access it quickly.  When you click on the Home option on the remote, displays a very thorough menu of options for Internet use, quick selections for some of the premium apps as well as a selection for just the Internet itself.* INPUT/OUTPUT:  At the side of the TV there are three HDMI connections (one labeled HDMI/ARC and one labeled HDMI/MHL) as well as three USB In ports.  At the back of the TV there is an H/P Out port for headphones, an Optical Digital Audio Out port, ethernet / LAN port, and a set of Component cable / AV ports.* REMOTE: The LN5700 is compatible with \"The Magic Remote with Voice Command\", which is available as an option.  The remote that comes with the TV is fully functional and will be sufficient for most users (although it is not back-lit).* HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  The LN5700 series from LG is a great bargain if you want a great TV with LED backlighting with a plethora of features and you are satisfied with a non-3D TV.  If you are looking for a 3D TV, try the LA6200 series, which is the upscale version of the LN5700.* UPDATE: I have been using this TV for more than eight months now (late-December 2013) and I am still impressed with all aspects of the TV, especially the picture.  I have had none of the problems that other reviewers have reported with power going off.* UPDATE: Other reviewers have reported on an LG software glitch that was sending user information to LG even when the user turned the feature off.  That glitch has been corrected as of 30 Nov. 2013 when my TV went through a firmware update.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing T.V. Better than Panasonic Plasa", "Author": "Antony Rosellini", "ReviewID": "R3OZ4HMZDPJF4C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok so buying a T.V. can be maddening. There are a lot of choices out there. I have looked at massive reviews both professional and customer. I went into the store to buy the new Panasonic 55 St60. Cnet gave this Panasonic it's highest recommend. So with me excited about purchasing this T.V., watching Blu-ray's, playing video games (which is very important to me) and seeing some awesome technology my wife turned my day upside down. She started pointed to this television which was next to the Panny. Then I played with the remote and used the Picture Wizard II which is a self help calibration tool that should be the standard for all televisions. I kid you not I had this set looking better than any T.V. in the store. Other customers noticed and even the employees were a little taken aback. So we purchased it. After two weeks I was having remorse because every review is talking about the St60 Panasonic. So I was going to return it but my wife again stepped in lol. And people she has never really cared about what the picture looks like. Especially to those of us who do the research and want the Best. Period. Tonight I thanked her and told her she had an eye for a great picture. I talked my Dad into buying the Panasonic St50 last year and we were over today watching it. Great T.V. don't get me wrong. But here is the deal..The colors Pop on this LG. When you calibrate it and please play with the settings and use the PICTURE WIZARD the blacks are black, the white's are white and the Contrast is near perfect. Video Games look amazing and no BLUR. Blu-ray's are jaw dropping. And I had a 2008 Sony XBR LCD that looked good. This blows it away.Smart T.V. is huge for us. We were using the PS3 for Vudu, Amazon, etc. Now we stream right from the television. And the LG's smoke the competition when it comes to using this feature. We just finished Game of Thrones in HDX and amazing picture. Also the update feature is key. You can either manually do it or you have the option to do automatic updates. Sweet Feature for us. So if you want a smart T.V. go look at the reviews on the LG's.Sound: This television has the best sound on the market. Period. We have it on 6 or 8 for regular TV and 13 to 14 for movies. It goes much, much higher than that. No Sound Bar required unless that's a must for you. Amazing sound.4 HDMI Ports. This is VERY important for someone like myself. Cable box, Ps3, Xbox 360, and Wii-U. So many televisions even in 2013 only come with three ports. so the 4th port was huge.So: I'm not trying to talk anyone out of buying a Panasonic Plasma. They are a sweet television in my opinion. Sweet. But I surprised myself and other people when they see this picture. My dad is bummed because he likes the Pop of Contrast colour's this T.V. turns out. The plasma's are amazing at getting that true black I love it. However when looking at these two Televisions side by side, the Plasma looked a little greyed out compared to this.It really comes down of course to what do you like. What are your needs and what benefit does the T.V. your buying have to meet those. And of course does it look great watching it. This television is AMAZING and priced great. For those reviews of those who have had problems I'm sorry. As consumers we are all rolling the dice and it's unfortunate to me. My opinion is every store should honor a two year or one year return policy no questions asked. The reason is technology is moving so fast that the life-span is not long and they are all tempermental. Burn in issues, power block problems, etc, etc. We should not have to suffer as consumers when we are all basically beta-testers while they make more advanced sets. AKA 4K which has arrived already. So when we spend our hard earned money on these fun Toy's at least when they fail switch them out and take care of us as customers.So Glad my Wife put her foot down on this television. Great buy you won't be disappointed I hope. Good luck I hope this review helps.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV with many minor issues and complaints....", "Author": "J. Brooks", "ReviewID": "R1E6IZQNNZCQC5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "- UPDATE - Aug 23 2013 -An Amazon app has finally been released for the LG TV and it works flawlessly! Easy to navigate and streams just as well as on the Roku. So after a few months of having to use the Roku to access all of my Amazon videos, I can finally get rid of it and have nothing more than the the LG TV.This LG 42\" Smart TV was a replacement for a 32\" Sony Bravia (which I absolutely loved).To start with, getting the TV setup was a snap and took no time whatsoever. I have mine wall mounted. I was a bit worried about the weight of the TV, but surprisingly being 10\" larger than the Sony, it weighs MUCH less. Once mounted, just within a few minutes of scanning for all the stations, the TV was setup, connected to the internet, and ready to go! Setup ease is a 10 out of 10! A monkey could do it!The first thing I noticed was the sound, not good at all. The built in speakers sounded awful and not clear at all. After a few days of tweaking and adjusting the settings I was finally able to get the speakers sounding a thousand times better, not perfect, but much closer to my previously owned Bravia. Out of the box, speakers/sound is a 2 out of 10. With tweaking, 7 out of 10.Featuring a 120hz refresh rate with the TruMotion technology, the picture quality is amazing! Just like the sound, I went in and adjusted the picture (temp, sharpness, etc.) and was able to get every ounce of quality pulled out of it for my room situation/lighting/etc..The TruMotion setting can and does make a lot of things (like video games and HD movies in particular) look really awesome, but regular over the air TV it can wreak havoc on and can give you a weird look/feel. By default the setting is set to smooth (level 3 out of 10), I have it turned down to 2 for normal TV viewing and that seems to have remedied the strange 'ultra smooth' motion for over the air TV. Picture quality is a solid 9 out of 10.The Smart TV apps were a HUGE plus and run much faster/better than the Roku or set top box versions. Web browsing is nearly impossible to navigate with the regular remote, I would highly recommend the LG's Magic Remote if you plan on using the internet browsing feature of the TV.The remote itself is fairly intuitive and easy to navigate. The IR and the pickup for it on the TV seem to have a sweet zone that is fairly small thus you really have to aim the remote right at the TV for it to work. The slightest obstacle or object obscuring the view of the remote stops it dead in it's tracks... it's been YEARS since I've had a remote this picky for a TV.Hulu, Netflix, Crackle, YouTube, and most every other other possible streaming app run fast, smooth and without error making my Roku more or less pointless to have, which was nice. HOWEVER the lack of an Amazon app to allow streaming of Amazon Videos is a HUGE downgrade as I have an extensive library of purchased movies and TV shows through Amazon. In addition to that, being a Prime Member there are a lot of free shows that Amazon offers. So unfortunately my Roku didn't quite become pointless as it is still needed for Amazon Videos.One thing that I have noticed is that there are small differences between some of the apps from device to device. For instance the Netflix app on the LG doesn't have a \"Play From Beginning\" option (unlike the Roku, XBox, Wii, etc.). So if a movie was watched halfway through and you want to start from the beginning, you have to scrub backwards or rewind the video once you've selected it. This is kind of a hassle and a bit irritating. Also I have yet to figure out how to rate shows/movies on Netflix... there just doesn't seem to be an option.The Hulu app on the LG works awesomely fast but ALWAYS pauses/freezes to load each ad for 3-4 seconds. This is not a connection issue since the Roku does not do this.Overall the Smart TV portion gets a 6 out of 10. There are a lot of small annoyances/quirks that just keep adding up and preventing the TV from getting a better rating in this department.If you are looking for an awesome feature packed Smart TV, this is definitely an option to consider, especially for gaming or movie watching.The picture is amazing. The sound can be tweaked to accomplish most anyone's sound preferences (though external speakers would be a recommended).The apps, while plentiful, are lacking a bit and/or straight up not available (Amazon Video App).", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Reasonably good for the price and my intended use...", "Author": "James K", "ReviewID": "R1Q1SXVJLDBXYL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(Since buying the 32\" version of this model, I have also purchased the 42\" version- just about everything in this review is also applicable to the 42\" version- see my full edits and additions at the end of this review)ORIGINAL REVIEW:I needed a small HDTV for my home office to watch news, etc while working. It's located 3.5' away from me on a file cabinet next to my desk. It turned out to be a bit larger than I expected for viewing that close, but after watching it for a few days I decided I really liked the size and didn't return it.THE GOOD:The LED back lighting is pretty even, it's not edge-lit, so it doesn't suffer from the bright-edge effect that many edge-lit HDTVs have, and not buying an edge-lit model was a main deciding factor. The off-axis viewing angle- left to right and below to above is pretty good, not as good as my CFL back-lit Samsung, but the LG cost a small fraction of the Samsung and there will never be a room full of people seated around watching it in my office like the Samsung in the living room. If you get off-axis far enough you will see some variation in the backlighting on scenes that have a uniformly dark background, like movie titles over a black background, but I doubt that most people would ever sit that far off-angle or notice it.The colorimetry was pretty terrible out of the box, and I was worried that I would have to send it back because I found it unacceptable, but after a half an hour of tweaking, viewing and tweaking some more I arrived at settings that were nearly equal to my Samsung and was satisfied with the results.The built-in speakers are down- and rear- firing, intended to bounce off what the HDTV is sitting on and/or the wall behind it if wall-mounted, and are adequate if you're in a quiet room. In a noisy environment, you may not find them adequate. In that case, there is an optical output on the back, intended to be connected to a speaker bar with it's own built-in amplifier or to a sound system (stereo or A/V) . One of the inadequacies of the manual which I'll discuss more fully later is that there is pretty much nothing mentioned about which models of LG speaker bars are compatible except the trade-mark \"SoundSync\" which I have not found mentioned anywhere in any of the LG speaker bars online or on the LG website itself. Something I noted about the volume control is that it appears to operate on a linear curve rather than logarithmic curve (which is normally used because it closely matches the response of one's hearing)- what this means is when you increase the volume to 50% of it's range, the apparent volume to your ear will sound like about 90% of it's full range, and there will be a much smaller increase in sound level when increased from 50% to 100%. An oddity that hopefully can be corrected in a future firmware upgrade, and not a deal-killer.I don't have a speaker bar, but I do have a wireless surround headset, and I connected it to the optical output to see if it would work. At this point I found that only the internal speakers or the optical output can be enabled at any one time, and this is not a problem if you're using a speaker bar, but I would have preferred to have an option to have both enabled at the same time so that I could used the mute button to kill the speakers when I want to use the headphones, instead of having to go through several layers of menus to do the same function. A bit annoying, but again, not a deal-killer. The wireless surround headset (an old Sony MDR-DS6000) were a huge improvement over the internal speakers.HDMI inputs work well, and my old, spare Panasonic DMP-BD35 Blu-ray player provided excellent quality picture and audio via HDMI input, as did a Windows 7 Media Center computer. I did not test any USB streaming devices, the analog outputs or the headphone output.I connected a basic 4-dipole un-amplified antenna (AntennasDirect DB4, no longer available for sale) that I had lying around just to make sure the tuner works. It's simply stuck in a window, pointed at a 90 degree angle away from all of the area broadcast towers and looking directly at a tree with full foliage outside the window. Even under such adverse conditions the HDTV gets quite a few stations, so if given a better antenna location I think the tuner would perform quite well.Netflix streaming works quite well and I haven't experienced any issues. I haven't tried any other of the Smart-TV options at this point.THE BAD:I don't love the menu system. It's not as user-friendly as my Samsung HDTV is, and I think many people will find it confusing. I've gotten used to it, but like I said, I don't love it.The manual is the worst part of this HDTV. Many things are not explained or not explained well. I mentioned about the lack of specifics regarding compatible speaker bars above.Another omission is information about the optional Skype camera- in the manual it only mentions the models AN-VC4** and AN-VC5**... after a lot of searching, I found only one model, the AN-400 on an LG foreign country website. Searching for this camera turned up sellers in Hong Kong, Great Britain and Australia (on Amazon and Ebay) for very high prices ($200+). Apparently the AN-VC5** is not yet available in any country in the world... This HDTV is a 2013 model, so maybe the accessories have not caught up with the HDTV model year yet. After a lot more searching I found the AN-VC400 available in the US for $99. From comments on the LG User forums it appears that one must use the LG webcams only with this HDTV. I tried several webcams I had and they were not recognized by the HDTV. This is kind of absurd for LG to exclude something as ubiquitous as a webcam from working unless it is one of their own manufacture, in my opinion. I'm still searching to see if other users have found cameras that will work, but the ones I've tried so far have worked universally on both Apple and Windows products and are very generic. The reviews of the LG cameras have been mixed.Also, in the menu system there is mention of connecting to wireless headsets, but no mention of anything about that in the manual. When I was searching for a new set of surround headsets I did run across a few that said they were compatible with some LG models (this particular LG model was not in the list)- I believe they were Sennheiser brand, but I'm not certain. There is no indication whether these are Blu-tooth, or other RF or what frequency range they operate on.Wireless connection- The MAC address (the unique hardware ID for the internal wireless adapter) is nowhere to be found. Because I've set the security up on my network to only allow access to devices which I own by including their MAC address in the router access table, I had to spend a significant amount of time to identify the MAC address for the LG HDTV before I could access it wirelessly. This information is required by the FCC to be displayed on the outside of the device on a tag or sticker, but was not on the LG anywhere. I realize most people may not be affected by this, but this information should have been displayed for those whose are security-minded like myself.From the comments left at the LG user forums, people generally have reported that LG support reps are difficult to contact and less than helpful.One final note: As others report, the base of the HDTV does not swivel or tilt, it is fixed... not a deal-breaker for me, but it might be for others.OVERALL: I think this HDTV is a good value for the price and produces very adequate quality pictures for a secondary screen. I would not buy this for viewing Blu-ray movies in my living room or home theater, but it's good enough that I bought a second one, a 42\" model to put in one of my bedrooms for occasional use. If you can put up with the lousy manual that is greatly lacking in information, it's probably a good-to-great choice for you.A BRIEF RESUME OF THE REVIEWER: I am an engineer for one of the three television broadcast networks and a great deal of my work day involves critically observing, analyzing and making corrections to HDTV media to ensure that what you see at home is the best it can be; I spend most of my day staring at high quality HDTV monitors, and my standards and expectations are unquestionably higher than the average person.*****EDIT 6/29/2013: Since buying the 32\" version of this model, I have also purchased the 42\" version for occasional use in my bedroom. Just about everything in this review is applicable to the 42\" version, although I found that my optimal video settings for the 42\" were just slightly different; this is partly due to the lighting in the 2 rooms being different- starting out with the settings I used on the 32\" and applying them to the 42\", I only had to make 3 minor changes to the brightness, contrast and color saturation to make both match each other closely.Also, I read one other reviewer mention that the screen is a matte finish... I would have to disagree with this. I have a Samsung HDTV that has a glossy screen, and a Samsung monitor that has a matte screen... I would have to call the LG screens for this model semi-gloss- you can definitely see reflections of objects and lights in the screen that are clearly defined when the HDTV is off, unlike my Samsung monitor where any refections appear as undefined blobs of uneven lighting, but somewhat less pronounced than my Samsung HDTV which has clearly defined reflections when it is turned off.An interested shopper asked whether the Smart App supported Amazon Prime yet... the answer at this point is that the firmware for both models I own does not support Amazon Prime as of 6/29/2013. Hopefully it will be updated in the future like some other LG models allegedly have been. I have a ROKU box that supports Amazon Prime, and honestly, Netflix video quality is much better to Amazon Prime at this time and Netflix has a much wider variety and greater quantity of programming, so I'm not really put off by not having Amazon Prime support at this point. Hopefully Amazon will up their game and improve the quality of their streaming products in the near future- I am a Prime customer, but I really don't take advantage of my access because the quality disappoints me whenever I watch something on Amazon.Other reviewers have stated that the headphone jack doesn't work, or that the headphone level is inadequate. The headphones must be enabled in the menu, and there is no setting for both the headphones and the speakers (or any other audio output for that matter) to be enabled at the same time. I personally would like to not have to go to the menu to switch back and forth. The headphones and speaker volumes are controlled separately, depending on which is enabled, and will return to the last setting for each, depending on which is currently available. When the headphones are first accessed, they are at a default low-level setting even if the speakers were last set to maximum, so one might not think they are working unless the volume is advanced. Once advanced, it will stay there after switching back to the speakers, which will remain at the last setting they were set at. The headphones at maximum are barely adequate in a noisy environment, and I agree with the reviewer that stated the volume range on the headphones is inadequate... it's just barely usable in my opinion, with no overhead for programming that doesn't have adequate volume level to begin with.Another interested shopper asked a question about the wall-mount hole spacing on the back of the HDTV. The 32\" model has 200mm x 100mm spacing (which is an uncommon spacing)  and the 42\" model has 200mm x 200mm spacing.One final note about screens on this model... the 42\" model in my bedroom is on top of a bookcase, and when lying in bed I have to look up at it... if my track lights are on while watching TV, there is a definite reflection from each track light that is reflected in a rainbow on 4 axis from each light source... it's very pronounced, and is likely an artifact of the light reflecting on the LED diffusion panel at the rear of the LCD screen; my Samsung HDTV does not exhibit this same tendency, it simply reflects an image of the light itself, however the Samsung has CFL illumination, and a different backlight diffusion technology, and this could be a characteristic of the LED illumination engineering. At any rate, when viewing the screen from eye-level, these reflections are not visible. Eventually, my plans are to wall-mount this and at that point I can tilt the screen slightly down and the reflections will no longer be a factor. As I stated below in my original review, I would not pick these models as my primary HDTV for my living room or home theater, but I think they are very good choices for what I purchased them for... for secondary occasional use in my home office and bedroom.Update 8-21-2013- I did get a wall mount for the 42\" LG in my bedroom and angled it so that I was viewing almost straight-on while lying in bed, as I mentioned above that I was planning to do. This was very effective at getting rid of the reflections from my track lighting that I mentioned above. The wall-mount was a fairly simple slimline mount, and only cost $20 on Amazon, so it didn't break the bank. I have a low platform bed and the LG is mounted fairly high on the wall, so unless you have a similar viewing scenario, you should not be affected by the same kind of reflections.Update 8-22-2013- I checked to see if there was any new firmware for the 32LN5700 and found that Ver. 04.00.20 is now available for both my 32LN5700 and 42LN5700. I updated the firmware and found that the Amazon instant video app is a part of this firmware update. After starting up the app (which took a long time the first time on the 32LN5700 and didn't complete, but on the second try it was faster and completed starting up) the first Amazon instant video screen appeared. From the Amazon instant video screen press the yellow button on the remote for 'help', Select 'Prime Instant Video', arrow over to 'Register your device' at the top of the screen, then on the following screen arrow down to 'Register Your Device'. A 5 digit code will appear. After you have the code go to the Amazon.com/mytv website on your computer and enter the 5-digit code that was displayed on the xxLN5700 to register the HDTV with your account and select your credit card info, billing address and a 5-digit PIN. Once registration is complete you'll have free Amazon Prime instant video (if you're a Prime member) and access to paid videos as well. If you're not a Prime member, the registration should be very similar and easy enough to figure out.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Broken after 4 months, software renders entire line unfixable as admitted by LG, won't refund money", "Author": "Jason W. Klimek \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R1SOAMB59IHLQD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV was great... for the first 4 months.  I was impressed that I could stream Netflix and YouTube from my Android phone to the TV using LG's version of Chromecast.  I also did not realize when I bought the TV that it was DLNA compliant and can stream from my NAS.  All those were great features.One day, about 4 months after buying the TV, I was watching Hulu and it just stopped.  I tried going to the app again and the TV said it was not connected to the internet.  So I went into settings and went to the network menu and attempted to connect to my network (I had the TV hardwired).  The TV kept saying that I needed to plug in my network cable.  So I unplugged the cable and attempted to use WIFI.  Again, the settings just said the network cable was unplugged and it would not let me enter the wireless or wired setup.I called LG and they sent a tech over a few days later.  When the tech came, the connectivity worked perfectly.  So I figured, and so did the tech, that it was just a glitch.  A few hours after the tech left, the TV did it again.  The TV was unable to connect to anything (network, internet, etc...) and when I would go to the settings menu the response time was dramatically slowed.  To move through the network settings menu took literal minutes.  When changing the volume, I have to wait about 10 seconds between each push, however I can clearly see the TV is registering each tap of the volume button because the light on the TV flashes when I push the volume, it just doesn't change the volume.So, I called LG again and they sent a tech back over.  He replaced the mainboard.  It happened again.  I contacted the tech and he called LG's technical support who told him it was a software issue where the apps would overload the board and cause a crash.  He explained this to me.  I called LG support and told them everything that happened.  They said they would work on the issue and would get back to me.  Several days later I hadn't heard back from them, so I called again.  I went through the same process and this time the representative gave me her email.  A few days went by and I emailed her to see what was going on with the TV.  At this point, since the techs said it was a software issue, meaning replacing boards or even the entire TV would not fix the problem, I wanted a refund.  I never received an email response from the representative.So I called LG for a 4th time.  This time I went through a representative, then a supervisor, then a manager.  At each level the LG person had to call over to LG's technical support to confirm (apparently no one knows how to communicate at LG) that this in fact was a software issue.  Finally, after talking with the manager, I got it officially acknowledged it was a software issue.  At this point, I asked if I could just have my money back because I was sick of dealing with this and the TV was only 4 months old.  She said she was not authorized to give me a refund and would have to send a request to the Return Authorization department and if they approved it, I could get my money back.  I asked if they denied it would I be stuck with a broken TV.  She point blank said, \"Yes\".  I was floored.  LG admitted it was their software that did not work, rendering the \"smart\" portion of this TV inoperable and they would not refund my money.I asked for the mailing address of the President of LG to write a letter, while I wait for what I'm sure will be a denial from the Return Authorization department.  The manager gave me some PO Box number.  After a little digital snooping on Alabama's Department of State website, I found the real address of the company and the president and executive supervisor for LG USA.  Below are there names and address in case anyone else would like to send a letter to LG.  I sent letters the other day and am waiting for a response.Kyu Moon Yu (president)Joy Mills (executive supervisor)201 James Record RoadHuntsville, AL 35824On the upside, because Amazon is a stellar company that actually values its customers, they said that even though I'm outside the 30 day return window, if LG doesn't help me, they will refund 80% of my purchase.  So basically, this was an $80 (assuming LG doesn't refund my money) lesson to NEVER EVER BUY AN LG PRODUCT.  I was seriously considering buying an LG G2 or LG Nexus 5 smart phone and some LG appliances in the future.  That will never happen.  Not only do they make terrible products, but their customer service is horrible and, even after admitting a problem is unfixable, they refuse to issue a refund.Update:  LG Return Department denied my refund claim because they stated they only serviced it once.  Apparently it did not matter that their own tech department said it was a software problem and could not be fixed unless there was a software update.  The current software version is 04.00.34 and is known to cause apps to crash which affects the entire network connectivity of the TV.  I think LG's customer service is deplorable and the company should be publicly shamed for knowingly selling and refusing to refund a defective product.On the upside, Amazon refunded 80% of my purchase price and I'm getting the Samsung UN40F6400, more expensive, but much better TV and I actually trust the Samsung brand having owned several Samsung devices.  LG will never get my business again, which is too bad for them because I buy an inordinate amount of technology and also recommend technology to my friends and family.  Someone at LG missed a business 101 class.Update:  12/9/13.  I just received a call from Joy Mills regarding the letter and invoice I sent LG.  After returning the LG TV to Amazon, Amazon charged a 20% restocking fee.  So, after detailing all the information in my letter, also including all relevant law regarding MA consumer protection and warranties, I invoiced LG for the 20% restocking fee I was not refunded.  I'm happy to say that upon providing proof that Amazon did not refund that 20%, Ms. Mills said that she would have the accounting department cut me a check and I should have it by next week.  So, all it took was about 5 different phone calls, a letter from an attorney (me) detailing all the relevant law and a promise to forward the issues to the Attorneys General of MA and AL.  It's nice that I finally got the 20% back, but honestly, it's $80, it's not that much money, it was more about the principle.  LG needed to stand behind their product, which, until the call from Ms. Mills, they hadn't.  LG has somewhat redeemed themselves, however, I'm still hesitant to purchase their products (love my new Samsung by the way).  But I will give credit where credit is due.  Ms. Mills was very pleasant on the phone and she solved my problem in about 5 minutes.  So, if anyone has a serious problem with their LG product that cannot get remedied through customer service, I highly recommend sending letters to LG corporate headquarters as I've noted above.Update:  12/20/13.  I received my 20% refund from LG.  Ms. Mills made good on her promise and I thank her for her help and quick resolution in the matter.  I only wish LG's customer service team had the intelligence to make this decision without me having to waste hours on the phone.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "NO AMAZON APP", "Author": "L.

HOWEVER - I do not have cable or satellite - I only do digital antennae and internet apps.  This is TV #3 - #1 is a Vizio with apps, #2 is an LG older model  - I use with Roku.  I was looking for Vizio, as I love our Vizio...but decided to go with this LG model because#1: similar price as vizio model we were looking at,#2 it has built n apps, (as does Vizio)#3 it has an internet browser (vizio does not),#4 we just bought an LG sound bar, and liked that all the LG things can be linked together.#5 1080/120hz (vizio model also had)So, I'm thinking that the two items that were different - especially that it has a web browser - was worth the extra $50 I spent for the LG.

That seems to have resolved the issue and the television works fine now. I asked the repair person if they received many calls service calls for similar problems with LG sets and he said yes. He was of the opinion that low end LG sets, like many other relatively low cost LCD televisions, tend be built with low quality components: for the most part it's not an issue, but you're always playing the odds that one component or another will malfunction.I'm not sure what to make of his comments...

At first, sporadically and then repeatedly. As long as the unit is plugged in it turns on, makes it to the LG logo screen and then turns off. I called lg tech support - the tech asked me to check for proper ventilation and to see if the power cord was properly seated; both were fine. That was the extent of his trouble shooting. He then told me that an LG tech would be sent to check the set, but alas there are no LG service centers in the East Bay (CA) so he gave me the numbers of third party technicians in the area.A quick search on google shows that this appears to be a common ongoing problem with what looks like the full line of LG television sets. The problem has been reported since 2008 and so far LG has yet to fix it or even acknowledge it.I can't really offer any further evaluation of this product as I haven't had it long enough to form an informed opinion.

The picture quality is nicer (although it required some adjustment) the sound is better (although an external surround sound would be even better) and the quality of the unit, especially the sturdy base is much better. The remote is even better, you need to have good aim but I have used it from 30 feet away, where the Westinghouse was iffy even at ten feet.The thing that disappointed me a bit about this tv is the \"smart\" part. I was happy to get rid of my Apple TV and only use one remote, and that part has worked okay but the app for Netflix is not as good as the app for Netflix on either the Apple TV or the Roku (or even the Wii, for that matter), it's very basic and with the remote that comes with the tv it can be very pokey to search for something. I have used the app for your iPhone that turns the iPhone into a remote, but it of course only works when the tv is connected to the network, and the tv is slow to connect and then sometimes the remote app is slow or decides not to work. The app is also VERY basic.The main Smart TV screen on the tv is full of different things, but many of them don't work with the remote that is included with the tv. I tried playing some of the games, but they are pretty much impossible with the included remote OR the iPhone app remote. I considered getting the Magic remote but 1.) it's annoying that you need to buy a separate remote to use so many features of the tv and 2.) I wasn't even sure which LG remote with \"magic\" in the name would be the right one to buy.Overall, I really do like this tv because of the quality of the unit, the picture, the audio and the fact I can use Netflix without another box or remote, and I also like the direct USB hookups. I figure the \"smart tv\" features can be improved with simple updates and maybe one day it will actually be worth it to purchase the magic remote but, as of this writing, I wouldn't get too excited about the \"smart\" part because...it's not.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy with our purchase, excellent TV!", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R1496JDGMZ364O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought the 39inch TV during Amazons pre Black Friday sale.

We though the interface was clean and easy to navigate (This is our first Smart TV, third LCD TV). The first thing my wife did was try YouTube, which worked as expected. Then she tried Netflix, which also worked as expected. The apps loaded quickly and without any issues. The picture quality is excellent, the sound is pretty good. The sound is a bit tinny but probably more noticeable because I've read some of the other Amazon reviews before buying. My wife does not notice and/or care. We\u2019ll probably add a sound bar at some point. We have not tried any of the other apps yet but so far we\u2019re pleased as it does what we wanted most (TV, Netflix and YouTube).

This is my third different brand in our quest for a 39 inch TV to fit my cabinet. I've had the Toshiba 39L1350u(hated it), the Vizio E390i-A1(like the picture but man was it buggy) and now the LG.We love the LG. I know the 39 inch is only 60hz(compared to the Vizio which is true 120hz) but at only 39 inches, we have not seen any issues with motion blur at all. To the contrary really. Also, the colors on the LG really pop too. My wife and I both think the picture is noticeably better on the LG. We are very impressed with the picture so far.I can't comment on the audio as I run mine through a separate receiver.The \"Smart\" part of the LG is very nice as well. It has pretty much all the major apps you can want, including Amazon(which it looks like was added just recently) and MLB.TV. The Netflix interface is ok. It lacks the Adult/Kids separate interface, which my daughter liked on the Vizio, but they do have popup listing of categories, which includes kids ones she can choose from. The Amazon interface is nice(simiar to the Roku and light years better than Vizio's quarter screen size window). LG has a TON of smaller apps/games to choose from. I feel like it will take us a while to go through all that they offer.All in all we are very happy with this TV and it looks like we found a keeper.ProsQuality picture that really pops.Good black Levels too.Solid Smart TV section with LOTS of choices.Apps within the Smart section seem solid.ConsI hesitate to put this in the Cons section but it is only 60hz which could be a con to some.Attaching the stand to the base was awkward. They have you put the screws in from the top, not the bottom like most. It makes keeping a screwdriver straight enough to screw in the front screw tough.Remote that came with doesn't allow any control of other devices. The Magic Remote which they tout and does control other devices costs (significantly) extra.**EDIT 9/12/2013 Simplink(for ARC) needs work**As an update, the only real issue we have is SimpLink and trying to use ARC(Simplink must be on to use ARC). It REALLY needs work and some extra controls. I have tried 3 different brand receivers(Sony, Yamaha and Denon) with this thing, on every one, Simplink thinks when you turn the TV on, it should trigger the receiver to switch to TV audio, no matter what. Just because I turn the TV on does NOT mean I am going to use the LG Apps at that time. This needs fixing immediately.Also, once in the Smart TV menus, I cannot get it to trigger the TV audio when I start an app like Netflix or Amazon. However, when I LEAVE/EXIT an app, it DOES trigger the TV audio switchover. This is COMPLETELY backwards and again needs fixing.As it stands now, Simplink/ARC is completely unuseable with this TV due to the control issues. LG needs to do some work on how Simplink interacts with non-LG products.BTW, for those that don't want to shell out for the Magic remote but do have an iPad or Smart phone, LG offers an app that can become a mouse pad/keypad of sorts when you are in the smart TV section. Once in the smart TV section, with the app running, pull up the mouse pad screen and the screen acts as a touch pad with mouse control, as well as a keyboard when needed. Makes things alot easier.** EDIT 9/26/2013 Ended up returning it **So, I ended up returning this TV. I REALLY wanted to like this one, as the colors and smart TV portion of it was great. However, what made us return it was we kept seeing strange occasional stuttering. It was weird. We could watch, say a tennis match or football and things would look great, but then we would see another scene and someone would move a certain way and the movement would stutter badly for a second or two, then be fine. It happened at times you would not think. You could also see like a frame skip in scenes with slow horizontal panning.We played with every setting under the sun, but could not eliminate it. After a while it just got too frustrating.We ended up going with the 40 inch Samsung UN40F6300. The Samsung is 120hz and we are not seeing the stuttering like on the LG. While the 40 inch doesn't quite fit in our amiore, I am adding a slide out tray which will give us the ability to pull the TV out and just swivel the Samsung a bit to put it back in the cabinet.I will say, the Samsung Anynet(for ARC) plays a LOT nicer with my receiver(Denon) than the LG Simplink did.

However, if you're looking for a WiFi-connected smart TV, keep looking. To me, LG's failure to disclose to potential buyers the fact that their WiFi-enabled TVs will not only spy on you, but do it poorly constitutes a bate-and-switch.There are (at least) three levels of wrongness to the software side of LG TVs:1. They spy on you. In order to use the smart TV features, you must first agree to terms of service which allow LG to collect data on everything you watch, files you access on the TV, even files on drives that you plug into the USB port. If you don't agree to these terms, you can't access the smart features at all. Orwell proved prescient in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\" our TVs do spy on us. He was just a couple decades off.2. They spy on you for the purpose of advertising. So, not only do you pay for the TV here on Amazon, if you use the smart features you just purchased, you will also get ads streamed from LG, essentially paying for the TV twice. The reason for those horrific terms of service that require you to sign away your privacy is so they can increase revenue by sharing detailed information about you and your family with advertisers. I already bought the TV, why does LG think it can keep charging me indefinitely through the guise of advertising?3. They don't even do it well. Adding insult to injury, LG sends all of this private, potentially sensitive data from your TV to their servers unencrypted. That means any hacker, government agency or sufficiently nosy neighbor could quite easily access the data. It doesn't matter if I don't have anything to hide or not, if I plug in a USB drive with photos of my family on it, and the TV reports back to LG all those file names, which includes the names of my family members, that's just icky. To then not even care enough about my privacy and security to encrypt that data is downright insulting and incompetent.LG says it's not their job to disclose these horrifying practices to buyers pre-purchase, they blame the Amazon and other stores. And yet it seems a bit far-fetched to expect stores to disclose information that LG doesn't include in any of its marketing materials. I would have liked to see a big, bold headline saying, \"WARNING: This TV will spy on you and your family, send that information unencrypted through the Internet, then share it with advertisers.\" But I don't expect Amazon to know about the crappy business practices of every manufacturer they sell from. This is on you, LG.Like I said, if you're just buying a really big monitor, this is fine. The picture quality is excellent. My only complaints on the hardware side are:1. The placement of the remote receiver at the bottom center of the screen is poorly designed. If you have a 5.1 surround system or a XBox, it's easy to block the receiver with the center speaker or the Kinect, which makes for an annoying reshuffling of components.2. The glossy coating, which helps make the colors pop and the black levels blacker, also results in rainbow flairs around the reflections of any lights in front of the screen. This means that not only the point of light is lost to you, but also bands radiating out from it distort the picture. A little repositioning and turning off lights before movies solves this problem. It's still better than a Plasma in this regard.If this were purely a hardware review, it would have gotten four stars. But this TV isn't just hardware, it's software too. LG's unethical, anti-consumer behavior makes me evangelistic in warning people away from their products.

The red led that lights up when the tv is off doesn't interfere with night vision and doesn't shine brightly that it would interrupt your sleep.The remote control that comes with the 42\" version is a standard remote, so it's a pain to try and use it for keyboard functions.  Luckily, LG has an app which lets you use a smartphone or iPod as a remote.  When keyboard input is needed, this is really useful.  Plus, the app tranforms to a mouse in place of needing to buy the \"magic remote\", and the app has a gamepad layout for when needing those functions.  Additionally, the app can stream live tv to your smartphone, so if you need to take a bathroom break you won't miss anything.  Although the standard remote looks like the buttons might be backlit, they aren't.As for the smart functions, the tv instantly found my PC, an external drive connected to my router as a media server, and was relatively easy to set up the wireless access.  I didn't find the games useful, as they are very limited and expensive (Where's My Water is listed at $3.99).Picture quality is really good, and the tv, even this 42\" version allows a lot of tweaking and settings adjustment.

Thus, this review provides preliminary impressions.PICTURE: Really outstanding.  Crisp, deep blacks, bright, with lots of pre-sets depending on your tastes.  We use this TV in our bedroom, and it's much better than our prior TV (a Vizio VT420M, which was no slouch).SOUND: Okay for TV speakers.  It's not as good as the setup in our living room, where we have five channel sound through an amplifier, but, really, it's fine for our bedroom.NETWORK CONNECTIVITY: This TV is wired directly to our router, but I tested the wireless just to see how it worked and it was trivial to set up and connect.OTHER PORTS: It has only 3 HDMI ports and they are located on the side of the TV rather than the back.  This is both good--it's easier to connect the blasted things up--and bad--you've got visible cables dangling from the side of the TV.  Personally, I'd prefer the ports on the back, but this is a minor thing.  Also, I could have used another HDMI port or two. We've got FOUR devices to connect--cable box, Roku, blue-ray player, DVD changer--and only three ports, so we have to use a switch for the blue-ray/DVD changer.  Eventually, we'll be able to eliminate the Roku, though, and the switch is an inexpensive model (<$20) from here on Amazon, so that's not a big deal. I've also split the cable signal, and used coax into the RF port on the back, so I've also got basic cable.  This would be useful if the TV supported \"picture-in-picture,\" but it doesn't appear to do so.The TV also has component video, digital audio out, and USB ports, none of which I've used.APPS.  This was one of the main attractions of this TV. It has built-in APPS for Netflix, Hulu+, You-Tube, Pandora, and a number of other online services.  The Netflix interface is clean and easy to use. The Hulu interface is similar to the one on Roku, with all the usual flaws that implies: it's hard to navigate, difficult to search, and regularly freezes and has  to be restarted.  I like the programming on Hulu, but their interfaces need serious work on all platforms, including the PC.There's no Amazon app at present.  That was true for my other LG TV at release, too, but the Amazon app appeared about six months after I purchased it.  It works fine--just like the App on Roku.Other than the buggy Hulu app, we've found no latency or other problems with Netflix or the Pandora app.There are games on this machine.  I haven't tried them and don't expect I will.  Indeed, with the WIDI display, other apps seem frivolous.WIDI Display:  This is one of the coolest features of this device.  If your PC supports \"WIDI display,\" you can redirect your PC's video and sound to your TV.  I've tested this, and it works great.  It's particularly great for HULU, where some of the content is restricted to \"web only.\"  The limited functionality of web browsers on smart TVs generally won't play this restricted content.  However, it plays on my PC and--when I redirect my PC to the TV--it plays there as well!  This feature works great, although there is some modest degradation of the display quality as compared with viewing HULU using the app on the TV.One comment on my prior, a Vizio VT420M.  This is a fine TV and worked well, but for two things.  First, the sound from my Roku player would start to gargle after about 20 minutes.  Turning the TV on and off would fix this, which strongly suggests a \"handshake\" problem between the ROKU box and the HDMI chip on the TV, and research on the web confirmed this suspicion.  I could fix this by snaking RCA sound and component video to my TV, but that brings up another challenge with the Vizio.  The design for changing inputs requires two choices, one of which scrolls through video inputs.  There's no single IR signal to the TV to say \"change to component video\" or \"change to HDMI port 2.\"  That means that Harmony remotes--or other universal remotes--need to know the current \"state\" of the video input in order to scroll to the correct new input.  Of course, there's no way for the remote to \"know\" that, and hence the TV is constantly on the wrong input and has to be manually switched.  If you go back and forth between online and cable content, this is truly annoying, especially if your partner is tech-challenged and can never figure out how to \"fix\" the inputs.  Thus, I gave away my old Vizio to a co-worker and purchased the new LG device.  I did this for the above two reasons, but the improvement in picture quality alone made the purchase worthwhile.CONFIGURATION:  a snap. I think my tech-phobic partner could have done it.INTERFACE: more or less intuitive.REMOTE:  The enclosed remote works fine and has all the required buttons. I have another LG TV with the \"magic\" remote, which uses an RF interface instead of IR. I HATE the magic remote and infinitely prefer the conventional IR interface.  An RF \"magic remote\" is available for this TV, but you don't need it.  I know some people like it, but I'm not one of them.  The \"mouse\" is difficult to control, and it relies on pop-up menus on-screen.  Since the mouse is difficult to control, the pop-up menus are frustrating.  I'd rather use buttons on a remote.As an aside, I use a programmable Harmony remote (the 520) to control my devices.  It works fine, but I had to teach the remote the \"back\" button that's essential for navigating the on-screen menus on the smart TV applications.  That's not a problem with LG, of course, but it is something missing from the otherwise impressive Harmony database.So...overall, we really like this TV.  The picture is awesome, the apps are satisfactory, and it's easy to control.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Kimo", "ReviewID": "R2YZCV49H2ROSS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a LG 7600  50 inch 3D TV last year and really liked it so when it came time to get a new TV for the lake cabin, I decided to get another LG this time the 5700  47 inch.  I zeroed in on the 5700 because of the price and a review said it had a matt finished screen.  The main thing I did not like about my 7600 was the glossy screen which picked up reflections real bad --- the matt finish on this 5700 is not as glossy but it would be much better if it were a bit more matty.The stand holds the TV a bit less than 3 inches above the cabinet it sits on and the cable box is 3 1/2 + inches high .  It would really be nice if the stand held the TV at least an inch higher so the cable box could slide under part of the TV.  The stand was very easy to assemble and attach to the TV.  Right out of the box, the TV worked well. The initial set up went very well and was very easy to understand/accomplish.  I found that the factory set energy mode produced a rather dim picture but after some tinkering, I had it adjusted to a brighter picture --- all the other factory settings produced great pictures.  I am not a fan of the magic remote and am glad the 5700 has a regular type remote.I would like to have seen more inputs --- I have a Cable Box / ROKU /BluRay that fill up the 3 HDMIs  Also, it has only one composite / component input.Amazon Prime is great, this TV was delivered by FEDEX in two days.PROS-Price-Picture Quality-Low Electrical Consumption-Built in wifi --- update TV's firmware-Internet Capabilities-LG app for the iPhone-Internal Speakers produce decent soundCONS-Number of Inputs-Edge of screen has a rather wide boarder (the boarder on the 7600 screen is much thiner and looks nicer).-Labeling inputs is limited to pre-designated \"tags\"-Rental of movies from LG is rather expensive but netflix & amazon are quite reasonable.-LG offers only limited explanation of what various TV controls do.July 21 editI've had the TV for a few weeks now and it continues to be a tremendous tv.  The internal speakers sound better than any internal tv speaker that I've had when the simulated 3D sound works but this feature just quit working.

The stand is easily attached. There are lots of available connections, including coax, component and HDMI. The WiFi connected easily, and I was able to make a connection with my iPad through the YouTube app. I also connected my PC with an HDMI cable. (There is a Share function to connect wirelessly, but I did not try that.)The picture is sharp and clear, and the Picture Wizard is a user-friendly way to adjust the picture for your viewing environment. If you are not happy with the picture quality, step through the Picture Wizard and it will show you how to improve it. I connected this television to both HD and SD sources. Although the SD picture is, of course, no where near the HD in quality, the TV gives a very good image even in SD. (Note: Be sure to set your input resolution for the best viewing. I do not like a stretched or cropped picture, so I set the screen resolution based on whether the image was SD or HD.)I am disappointed that there is no Amazon app available, but I had already purchased a Roku to access Amazon Instant Video. The Roku is easy to connect with the LG and they work well together.There is an optional Smart Remote available, but I did not purchase it. I don't like that the remote that allows you to access some of the TV's features costs extra, but the standard remote will do much of what you need. One thing I noticed is that the remote must be pointed directly at the TV to work.Most of the time, we use the Dish remote to control the basic TV functions. It took seconds to program the Dish remote to control the LG TV, and it was much easier than I expected. (I did an online search for \"program dish remote to operate tv\" and found a YouTube video that showed exactly what to do. You could also call Dish or refer to the Dish manual or website.)Overall, I am happy with this television. It does everything I need it to do and more.

So watching during the day time or a well lit room is no problem with this Tv.I would also like to note that I am a big gamer.  One of the major things I was looking for when doing research was how responsive the tv was playing video games.  And I am very happy with how good my Xbox 360 and Ps3 work on it.  I even hooked up my computer to it to play some of my steam games.Something I don't like about this Tv is the Tru-view or Tru-motion system.  I think that's what it called.  With this mode active it makes your movies and tv shows look like they have very strange camera movements.  For awhile I thought it was just the way the Tv processed the video.  But thank god I was able to turn off that feature.Something else that I am kinda annoyed about with this Tv is it does not have the Amazon Instant video App.  It's not available to download as well.  But yet it has most of the other ones.  Personally I have a lot of movies purchased on Amazon so this is especially annoying to me.  So I have to waste one of my 3 HDMI ports for my ROKU box.  If they added Amazon instant video I could remove my ROKU altogether.The smart Tv features are an interesting feature to me.  It's my very first Smart tv and I love the idea.  I am also a power user on the computer so by hooking up my computer to the tv.  I am tempted to just use the computer over the smart Tv system.  Especially on things like Youtube.  I really don't like the interface for youtube on this tv.  I understand they are just trying to make it easier for the user but I prefer Youtube as it is on the computer.  Also searching for things with the basic remote that comes with the Tv kinda sucks.  I've been considering getting a tablet to interface with the Tv's Bluetooth it make searching easier.  But again I have my computer hooked up with a wireless Keyboard and mouse.  So it's almost pointless...The speakers on the Tv are not to bad.  I prefer a richer fuller sound so I have hooked up my old 5.1 system to the Tv.  I am considering getting a sound bar for it.  As I am hearing some good things about them.All in all I am happy with my decision to purchase this Tv.

The sound settings give you a limited amount of customization, and I wish it had a bass boost, but otherwise no complaints. I've been listening to both music and standard TV programs.The quality of the picture is what sold me on LG TVs over the other brands when I went to the store to check out the different brands. As a previous fan of high end Sony TVs, this one holds its own in terms of sharpness and detail.

A keyboard is way better than the remote to input my usernames and passwords for the included Hulu and Netflix apps.

The color and image depth made it seem different than other times we had viewed the blu-ray on another HDTV. Everything looked unnaturally sharp and so crisp it was more like we were actually a part of the movie rather than just watching something on a TV. We also noticed the sharpness in regular TV shows. They all seem to look like a nature documentary. The picture really pulls you in; it's something that I have not experienced when watching other HD Televisions.- Smart TV Features: Every night my husband and I have a ritual of watching the newest trending videos on YouTube. The YouTube app that this TV uses has nice, big icons for the videos which makes it easy to browse and select videos. We also enjoy watching Netflix.- Brightness options: Pressing the \"Ratio\" button brings up a miniature menu across the bottom of the screen to quickly adjust audio, video, and closed caption options. The Energy Saving feature allows you to set your TV to automatically adjust its brightness based on ambient lighting. For example, when we turn off the lights in the room, it automatically dims the TV. Even better, when you want to set the sleep timer, you can select \"Maximum power saving\" and it makes the TV very dim- good for those nights when you want to fall asleep to the TV.Dislikes- No Amazon Video App: Chances are, if you're on this site- you already know how great Amazon Prime is the amount of amazing television and movies available through Amazon Instant Video. Unfortunately, you will still need a gaming system or set top box to access Amazon's Video app.- Remote: It is gigantic, clunkly, awkward, long... I could go on. The worst part for me is the 4-point directional scroll buttons surrounding the \"OK\" button. These directional buttons are not very well defined which causes me to hit \"OK\" unintentionally about 50% of the time. This is extremely frustrating!

And Standing 100+ ft away I noticed this TV. I told my wife look at that fricking picture on that tv, I hope it is the obe were looking for.......YEP!!! It was... Wow! Now I would have bought it on just the pic quality. But the Sound quality is as good as my home theater systems, and when I observed how many features it had....Wow.Jackpot!So i rate my critera as follows:  A.10  B.10  C.10", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am finally impressed", "Author": "B.

My other is a LG Cinema Screen 47LM8600 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz Dual Core LED-LCD HDTV, which got a mixed review from me.  Aesthetically, this is a beautiful television set. Very thin and unusually light in weight.  Set up was relatively quick with onscreen menu prompts that guide the user every step of the way.  The picture quality is impressive to say the least.  Although, I would recommend minimizing the TruMotion feature to eliminate the unnatural \"sped up\" motion during moving sequences.  I would also suggest playing with the picture and audio settings to achieve the desired settings that work best for whatever environment this unit resides in.  The factory settings, although adequate, can be easily improved upon for superior quality.  An issue I had with my previous LG 3D HDTV was a bizarre \"ghosting\" effect during fast motion, especially during dimly lit scenes.  Despite repeated attempts to correct the issue with LG technicians, the problem persisted.  Thankfully, I am happy to report that no such ghosting issue was observed with this unit.  It is possible that LG was aware of the problem with previous models and have since made adjustments.  Whatever the case, it is a welcome bonus for this reviewer.  The sound capabilities seemed fine for this reviewer's perspective.  It is a well known fact that many of today's HDTV's are lacking in the sound department given their slim size, but I found this unit's sound system to be above average.  The only quibble with this unit, and it is a personal one, is the magic remote control that LG uses for many of their HDTV units.  It is frustrating at times given that it too sensitive to movement and rather hard to use when navigating through the various menus.  Again, this is matter of personal taste, but I much prefer a standard remote control.

We are limited to 150GB a month, and on average us about 50GB a month. But the last two months we hit our 150GB useage in the first 15days of our billing cycle!!!  That means it jumped 6 times normal usage?We contacted HULU and Neflix and checked all the settings and they are at low.LG tells us to unplug and press the power button for 30 sec.Yet when we experimented and only had one device connected to the internet for one day each, the TV was pulling 13GB in one day!!!

The sound and the picture are bar none to any other 120hz TV I've seen on the market at this price point.  I've had the 55\" for about 3 months, and I love it.For anyone wondering about the \"TruMotion\" and afraid that it's not really 120hz, but an upscaled 60hz, that's not the case.  TruMotion is a feature on the TV that allows you to adjust the blur and sharpness of your refresh rate.  This is a 100% 120hz set. (My 55\")The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of some of the features in the Smart TV function fail sometimes.

I've already installed one that is sent directly to my TV to download, but LG just hasn't made an update to fix this issue yet.Pros:Great Picture.Great Price.Tons of adjustable settings to give you the experience you want.The ability to control all HDMI inputs with a single remote through LG's SimpLink.Cons:Semi-gloss on the screen causes slight reflection.

I was so impressed with the TV that I decided to buy one for my place.  Mine had to fit an existing cabinet which made it more challenging.  It turned out that the 39 inch model (39LN5700) would fit my cabinet.  Out came the 150 pound Toshiba 32 inch Flat Screen that had occupied that space for 12 years and in went the LG.  This was absolutely the best decision -- better picture and functionality.  It was really eerie when I was watching one of the Mecum auto auction shows and the camera panned the engine compartment when, coincidently, I was up next to the TV.  It was so lifelike, I felt that I was peering into the engine compartment at the show!  To save a few bucks, I purchased the 39LG5700 from Pinnacle Deals (in \"Like New\" condition) through Amazon for $404.95 and $19.50 shipping.  Great price for a great TV!With a little digging I found that I was eligible for six months of Netflix for free.  This was available even if you were already a subscriber to Netflix (they just add the 6 months to your account).  I signed up for the free month before filling out the 6 month freebie. so I may be getting 7 months totally free.  I believe that the bigger TVs get a year free.

Out of the box the picture was great, sound is running through a pioneer VSX-D814 receiver and the video to sound has no lag, unlike watching some TV'S that look like a cheap kung fu movie.

I calibrated it with an AVIA disk and a pair of blue glasses for movie watching, but the calibration settings listed in \"Consumer Reports\" actually looked a little better to my eyes. I am also pleased that I personally notice little of the motion control problem with the \"TruMotion\" feature turned off (I am a sports fan, and this was considered to be a slight problem for this TV). (Note that when \"TruMotion\" is on the TV displays a \"soap opera\" effect). Finally this is a smart TV with many different apps and that is a big plus (I appreciated having an app for Redbox streaming as I believe it is an up and comer and will be an outstanding service when more content is added).A few negatives. The picture is slightly compromised when not viewing straight on and the best picture is in front of the TV. If placed high you will want a tilting mount to tilt the TV down. The sound is nothing to write home about but quite acceptable.

Not overly noticeable, but enough that you wouldn't want to crank it up too too much. But, like 99% of TV's on the market, if you want the audio to match the video, you'll need to invest in some audio equipment as well.

Potts \"mrpotts\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZDLONCPTJJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second LG TV I have bought (my first one is 7 years old and going strong with heavy use) and I'm really pleased with LG TVs.  I should start by saying I am highly technical and really into my electronics so I set really high standards for the products I buy.Firstly, if you plan to use the smart features don't feel like you need to have the Magic Remote (which this TV does not come with).  I have an iPhone and the LG TV Remote app is AWESOME.  It has a keyboard which lets you type in web addresses directly from your phone (or entering any other kind of text when needed) which is a must if you plan on using the browser frequently.  The best thing about the app however, is the trackpad.  The app literally turns your phone into a trackpad like you'd find on a laptop to control a mouse on the TV and it works incredibly well.  Super fluid and really a joy to use.On to the Smart features...  LG did a great job in my opinion.  The Apps open quickly, seem responsive and altogether work really well.  I just bought a 65\" Sony for my Den and though the interface is a little cleaner for its smart functionality, the features do not work as well as they do on this LG and it was literally over 4 times the price.  I was able to easily setup a media server on Macbook Pro using the free application Plex Media Server and I can now easily display my photos or access my music collection on the TV wirelessly.For the price of this TV, the picture is really great.  I do recommend turning down the TruMotion settings.  I have the de-judder set to 2 and it really calmed down the \"soap opera\" affect you will find on most the TVs being made today that are pushing 120/240HZ etc.  You can really go nuts and fine tune the picture on this TV to your hearts content.  I normally don;t like the Vivid picture setting on TVs but on this set all I did was set it to Vivid and turn down the try motion and I'm really happy with the picture.This TV looks really nice in our family room and I am really happy with it overall.  If it's anything like my previous LG, I expect to get many happy years out of this TV.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV and Amazon Service was Spectacular!", "Author": "Guy S Haggard", "ReviewID": "R1YH0TGHHVCNQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV was a Christmas present to my college aged son and it arrived with the screen shattered in shipment. On Christmas day, I went on-line, clicked on return item, wrote a few words about the problem, and received an email within 10 minutes that Amazon would pick up the damaged TV and send us a brand new one.  Talk about hassle free!!!  UPS showed up at the door at 9:00 am the next morning to pickup the old TV.  Amazon overnighted a replacement TV that was received in perfect condition the next day.  My son was thrilled. Now compare that to if I had purchased the TV from a local big box store? Just to buy the TV would have been an all day ordeal fighting the crowds and lugging the 50\" fifty pound box all over town.  Then do it again to return the damaged TV.  I would have had to lug the TV into my car.  Oops, the box won't even fit in my car.  I would have had to find a friend to help me take it back to the store, wait in a \"no-customer service\" line for hours, argue about who cracked the screen, then lug the new TV out to my friends car, and then lug it back into the house.  That would have been an all-day ordeal.With Amazon, I bought the TV in 5 minutes, it was delivered to my door in 2 days, I returned it to my door, and a new one delivered to my door in much shorter time than any other possible purchase option - with no hassle at all.  All my purchases will always be with Amazon in the future.  Amazon service was nothing less than SPECTACULAR!!!Oh yea, back to the TV. Great picture.  Unlike other smart TVs, this one actually has an internet browser built in so you can search the web on the TV and has hundreds of Apps.  Excellent picture.  Lots of inputs.

I immediately called up Amazon and asked for a new one but they had told me they were sold out of that model. They then told me they could offer me a refund for the amount I paid but Black Friday was long over and I knew I wouldn't be able to find a comparable deal anymore. I then asked to speak to a manager and they told me to pick out another 55\" with all the same features and they would price match it. So that's awesome. The manager told me to check out this model and said they'd price match even though the big $ difference. Over all an awesome customer service experience.Now to the TV. First off the box this thing comes in is huge. A good 10\" longer than the box the 55 Vizio came in. It was a very tight squeeze to fit it in the back of my truck so take that into consideration. It was also packed much better than the other tv too.I do more research on products than just about anyone I know. I'm talking hours and hours. Reading hundreds of reviews from multiple sites. Do to the return ordeal I had very little time to actually research this tv. I looked at a few reviews and the features list and that was about it. So of course I was a little nervous before I turned it on. So far I've had the tv for a little over a week and I am very impressed.  Setup took less than 10 min and that includes connecting it to the wifi. It is replacing the 51\" Samsung plasma I've had for the last two years.PictureVery very good picture. I've been to Best Buy, Walmart, etc and looked at all the big screens there and this one could compete with any of them. I know I'm coming from a plasma but this one is very bright. It does have the local dimming and I use that being in a poorly lit basement. The blacks are dark and the whites are bright as the contrast ratio would tell you. LG is known for their colors popping and this tv is no different. The picture settings are also pretty extensive. If you don't know what you're doing then the Picture Wizard thing can make it easy on you. I have no light bleeding issues from the edges like some others have talked about. Last Sunday I watched about 8 straight hours of football on it and was very pleased. Very bright, very smooth. It really doesn't need much of the tru motion effect as I have mine set to 2 which is below the default. I've also watched a couple blu rays and even played some PS4 games on it and still couldn't be happier. Unless you go 4K or 240hz, you're not finding a better picture on a 55\" for under $1200 or so. My brother in law bought a $1000 Samsung Smart TV on black Friday and there's no difference in picture quality once the settings are adjusted properly. I actually like LG's interface better too.SoundI can't really provide much of a review on the sound because I have it hooked up to my 5.1 sound system. Right when I plugged it in I did turn up the volume just to see how loud is was and was impressed. I'm very picky about my sound but if you're not then this would be plenty for just a living room tv.AppearanceI really like the look of this tv. The bezel has a brushed black look to it around the screen. Also for being a direct lit LED it's fairly thin. I have it on the stand currently but plan to mount it real soon. Will look good either way. Very light for its size too. The screen has a slight glossy to it nothing that would prevent me from buying it. Pictures need gloss to provide more depth and a better picture for you anyway. There would be no light issues in a regularly lit living room.RemoteThis tv comes with a nice big remote. The Vizio remote was about half the size and much lighter than this one. It's not backlit but does have a nice glossy finish to parts and has all the smart buttons you'll need. No it doesn't have a keyboard on it but the tv will sync with any wireless keyboard you can find. Makes it much easier to use the smart features with one.Smart TVI haven't really used anything Smart on this tv because of my slow internet. I live out in the country so my speeds are real slow.

What good is 120hz when you get soap opera effect on everything?  It's what it sounds like.. If you seen an american soap opera, you can see that it does not have that movie film quality to it.

So i looked around and almost bought a Samsung, but they were out of the model I wanted. (I was ready to go big and get in on the Smart Tv Revolution.) So I  was checking out sound bars when the salesman got distracted and I saw this LG on sale.  I checked out the sound on it and it was hands down better than anything I had heard in the store.  And I really did not want to buy a soundbar after spending hundreds of $ on a TV! So after checking reviews I went back that night and took it home and set it up.  Now I can get around on a computer but am no pro, that's why I married a software engineer. Even with the wizard out of town, in minutes this tv was hooked up to wifi and I was in business.  Picture was great out of the box, as they have a Store Pic or Home pic option. Since then I have been watching YouTube videos and Netflix and movies on the tv and am beyond pleased.  It did crash  (froze) once while i watched a bit of the comedy channel on the web, on the TV.  But I had been flailing back and forth with the remote and its understandable. When my HD reciever and dish comes, I will not be watching  CC.com  on the TV.  Also you get free Pandora and I love that free feature.  The sound on that is fantastic, and I can hardly turn it up past ten--out of 100.  I would give this 5 stars and it deserves it but don't know why the TV froze that one time.  Back to Netflix: it hooked right into our account and loads movies in seconds. Also, watched about 25 YouTube videos in a row last night, loaded them super fast.  You can do internet searches via Bing and you probably want a wireless keyboard for that; I will buy one soon (logitech). I would like to use Google but not an issue at this point.  Most of the games that come with the TV are not free but not an issue since we have PS2 and a Wii...  Also, I was not happy i had to set up a stand on it but that only took a couple minutes.  A monkey could do it, or my dog. Also, I would like to say I have an LG refrigerator and it has horrible sound and poor picture but keeps food really cold.  Lastly-- looking forward to joining Hulu Plus and/or Amazon Instant, those will be very nice features to go with this great TV! Thanks LG!  **** warning: your viewing habits may or not be sent back to LG HQ!  If that bothers you, do your research.

Plenty of built-in apps and dozens more to download. with 3 HDMI inputs, it is plenty for me since I use my receiver to switch between Blu-Ray player, PS3, Wii and my cable box so only 1 HDMI is going into the TV. If you use a receiver for your audio, keep in mind that the built-in apps along with Netflix, Amazon VoD, Hulu, etc. will play through the TV speaker unless you get a optical audio cable and run it from the back of the TV to your receiver.

I was able to play all my movies which are in MKV, MPG and AVI formats without issue, streaming from my desktop via WiFi on the TV.

The interface is great, but i'm entrenched in my Apple TV so I plan to ignore this feature.-A guided setup which I love, and makes it easy to make the picture look good without tweaking.-3 HDMI inputs. This is a necessity for me (PC, Apple TV, 360). For some reason, a lot of TVs come with only two HDMI inputs.A few minor issues:-Sound from the speakers is not that great. This is a fundamental conceit for slim TV's. It's good enough, though. The speakers fire directly downwards (apparently), and I have my TV hanging on a wall with nothing underneath it. If you have it inside a cabinet, the sound may be better, I dunno.-The 'True Motion' setting is on by default. It makes everything look like a daytime soap opera. I recommend turning it off.

After doing a few weeks of research and examining many models closely I landed on this one as the best option in this price range.My most important consideration by far was picture, especially color and viewing angle. The 42LN5700 delivers on both, especially with Dynamic Color (DC) turned off. DC is on by default, and my initial reason for turning it off was that I saw blown-out red/orange colors on faces sometimes. Disabling DC fixed the face problem--it made other colors seem faded at first, but after a few minutes I could tell that they were actually more lifelike now, and DC had been adding too much saturation. (Your personal preference may vary though.)Regarding viewing angle, I regularly watch this set from a secondary kitchen location that is well beyond 45 degrees off center, and the picture still looks great. In my experience other sets tend to become greenish-gray much more quickly when viewed off-center.The only picture flaw with this set is that there are slight, very small dark patches in the far corners. I saw five examples of this model and they all exhibited this flaw, but I bought it anyway. No other 120Hz 1080p model at this size and price had perfect corners AND comparable picture quality otherwise. The issue is so minor that it does not bother me even though I am someone who is easily bothered by small things. It is only really noticeable on a pure white screen. Again though, your preference may vary so if the corners bother you then you may want to go with another model that may not have as good a viewing angle, or spend in a higher tier.I don't have particular demands when it comes to Smart/App features so I can't offer worthwhile comments on those. The only other flaw I can think of is that assembling the base stand requires a very long Phillips-head screwdriver to perform comfortably, so make sure you have one handy if you plan on using the base.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great HDMI TV", "Author": "Casper", "ReviewID": "R1YIHQJYSIQ24I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Has a great picture and sound.

I've been an Amazon customer for a couple years now and they went out of their way to make sure that I didn't lose out on a purchase. It wasn't their fault that the T.V. was lost in shipping, but they made up for it anyways. I have never received that level of generous Costumer Service from any other company. I hardly review products unless they are really good or really bad. In this case, I just had to tell people about the amazing Costumer Service that Amazon had given me.LG Electronics 47LN5700 47-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV (2013 model)Now, for the review of the product. I would give it a 4/5. It is an almost perfect Smart T.V. I have ordered it for my bedroom. It is my very first HD LED-LCD Smart T.V. I have been used to large SD TVs for my whole life, until now. I was just excited to be able to finally experience the new T.Vs.PROS- Price- Energy Efficient- Amazing picture- Great Sound- Convenient Entertainment Smart Apps- Built in Wi-Fi Connectivity- USB support for videos, music, pictures, etc.- LG CloudFirst off, the price was amazing. $599.99 for a 47-inch HD Smart TV was a deal breaker for me. I compared the specs to other T.Vs on Amazon and this had the most value for the price. Speaking of saving money, this T.V is also energy efficient. According to an Energy Guide that it came with, the Estimated Yearly Energy Cost is $10. This is based on an estimated 5 hours of use per day, 11 cents per kWh, and 95 kWH total energy use per year. I have an HD Smart TV now and I don't want to go back to the SD quality TV. The quality of HD videos, shows, and movies is just too great for me to ever consider going back to SD T.Vs. I have never seen such detail and vivid colors like this before. I noticed that some reviewers had some concerns on the sound quality of the T.V, but as far as I can tell, the sound that it offers is pretty good. It may have a volume difference, depending on the source of the media, but that really wasn't a problem for me.I'm not big on the many Smart Apps that the LG store offers, but for my entertainment needs, the ones that it came with are all that I need. I don't have cable. I only have my Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime subscriptions because cable costs too much money. These entertainment apps work great on the T.V. I have no problems with them and they all stream in HD. The built in Wi-Fi connectivity is great too. I'm glad that I don't have to buy an adapter for it, so it saves me the trouble. My Wi-Fi router is in the downstairs flat underneath me (2 family flat and I live upstairs).  As far as I can tell, I haven't had any connectivity problems. You can also have the T.V to connect to your own server on your network and have it stream media files. It adds to the convenience.I love the USB support too. I wasn't aware of what it could do when I was making the purchase, but it impressed me. You can put your movies, shows, music, pictures, etc. on a flash drive and plug it in to the side of the T.V. Then you can access them at the LG Smart Share menu. I have tons of digital movies and shows. So far, I have tried several file formats. Those formats are .mkv, .avi, and .mp4. I haven't had a problem with any one of them. The LG Cloud is pretty neat too. They give you 5GB (I think) of digital storage. Then you can access your cloud files from the Smart T.V. I have uploaded my music to LG Cloud and I use the T.V to play it. Now I don't have to buy a speaker system for my phone. I could just use the T.V.NEUTRAL- Video lag from USB supportI would say that the video lag from the USB support is the only neutral aspect of the T.V. The reason why I consider it neutral is because I know how fix it when it happens. Sometimes, when a movie from the flash drive is paused for awhile and then played, the video would lag terribly. It would be out of sync with the sound and skipping. The fix is pretty easy. All I do is press the \"back\" button on the remote to exit out of the movie. Then I would just click the \"OK\" button on the movie file again. It would ask me if I want to \"start playback from the beginning\" or \"continue where I left off\". I would continue where I left off and then it would start back up and the lag would be gone. I have noticed that the lagging hasn't happened to me at all in a while, however.CONS- Remote buttons can stick- Delay in response time between remote and T.V- Menu can take a bit to getting used toThese are some really minor set backs from the T.V. The remote buttons do stick a little bit. Sometimes when I press buttons on it, they would get stuck when they are unpressed. There can be a 1-2 second delay in the response time between the remote and the T.V. I would just press a button and I'd have to wait a bit until I see a response from the T.V. The menu can also take a little bit to getting used to at first. When I first set the T.V up, the first thing I did was try to familiarize myself with the menus. It can look jumbled up and confusing at first. However, I got used to it after a little while.CONCLUSIONSo overall, I would give this LED-LCD HD Smart TV a 4/5. It is almost perfect. It has very few minor set backs, but it shouldn't stop you from purchasing it. I would definitely recommend purchasing a T.V from the Amazon website. They will give you great customer service if you ever run into problems with your order. I would definitely recommend getting an HD Smart T.V.  The quality of High Definition just destroys Standard Definition. The Smart features really revolutionizes the entertainment quality of the T.V. I would definitely recommend the purchase of this LG Electronics 47LN5700 47-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV (2013 edition). It will not disappoint you. This is a high quality T.V and it has me hooked. It is a great first HD Smart T.V. I will love all of the T.Vs that today has to offer if it's anything like this T.V.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Husband bought it, I love it- Perfect for mounting on the wall- very sleek", "Author": "CarolinaMom", "ReviewID": "R160LC26CB5UT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We recently moved into a new house where the TV is mounted above the fireplace.

I went back to the \"big box\" and looked at a number of sets and decided to try the LG. I found that all LED's are a little \"glossier\" than what I was used to with the old LCD. Neither of the LED's were appreciably better in this regard and both sets have a downward firing speakers which affects sound quality.I decided to keep the LG for several reasons. The LG has a built in picture calibration utility which makes video setup a snap. Both the Samsung and the LG have a User Guide that is preloaded with the set software and also available as a pdf on the 'net. The Samsung is a single font and runs to 600+ pages printed. The LG is multi-font and runs about 250 pages...much easier to read. I preferred the LG Manual and also the LG on-screen settings menu and overlays. The remotes are nearly identical although the Samsung has backlighting. For on-set controls, the LG has standard on/off channel up/down volume up/down buttons on the right side whereas the Sumsung has a little \"joystick\" on the bottom.One thing I did like about the Samsung, it has two HDMI inputs on the back and one on the side. The LG has all 4 HDMI inputs on the side, which is kind of awkward. Both sets have component in and RF(cable) input on the back. The LG also has the remote sensor bottom/center on the front of the set so you may have issues with the center speaker, if you have a home theater setup. Both sets have optical audio out on the back. The LG has ARC. Setup on both sets was easy, including WiFi.Several people in these reviews have asked about Amazon streaming video. My LG set did a software update and it is available and I was able to register both sets with Amazon although I haven't had a chance to watch any video. Both sets have USB ports on the side and I found the the Logistech K400 keyboard/mousepad is plug and play on both sets.Note that these sets are dissimilar in the the LG is 120 hz and has a slightly larger screen. I was shopping to fit existing furniture so I needed a set 38 inches wide or less. The LG is about 25% more expensive.

I don't care about 3D, Smart TV, super-thin bezels, Magic Remote, voice control, or sound quality.  I have it hooked to a receiver, which takes input from a HTPC and a PS3.I tried 50LN5400 and I can tell you that LN5400/5700 are two very different TVs.  LN5400's CPU and GPU is from 2011/2012, and the software is pretty bad.  It has problems rendering the sharpness of fonts.  Texts look either blurry or oversharpened.  LN5700 has this year's CPU and GPU, and texts look crisp and beautiful just like on a monitor.  Also, the backlights of NL5400 are poorly placed.  There are dark patches on the screen.  The 5700 has almost perfect screen uniformity.  On an all-white screen you would notice some faint dark patches, otherwise you would notice nothing at all.  I suspect that 5400 is a TV from previous years rebranded as a 2013 model.Now about the 5700:Since the TV is direct-lit, panel uniformity is nearly perfect and there are no backlight bleeding which is a common problem for edge-lit TVs.  There were a few \"dead pixels\" and I was worried - they turned out to be dust particles.  I wiped them off and the TV has no dead pixel at all.Color saturation is great since the TV uses an IPS panel.  This is important for games and animes; they often look dull and grey-ish on other panels at this price point.I tried the magic remote at a store on a LA6900 and absolutely hated it.  Fortunately LN5700 has a regular remote, and it is easy to use.It is quick and simple to adjust picture settings.  I have it on game mode and turn off all artificial processing settings.  In the night I turn the backlight down from 45 to 27 or 30.However IPS panel does have poor blacks.  I guess I will have to put up with it until OLED becomes affordable.  Until then, this will be my last LCD/LED TV.Smart TV is useless but I do like the wifi capability.  You can update the firmware.  Occasionally firmware updates can bring massive performance increase.  I had a Panasonic DT50.  Colors were very inaccurate and ugly, but one firmware update fixed it.The assembly process can be frustrating, as some screws are to go deep inside sockets.  You need a thin screwdriver to be able to drive the screws.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Potentially a great TV", "Author": "G. P. Stern", "ReviewID": "RU2J30BE62XYZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the LG 47L5700 locally to replace a several year old Sharp 46\" LCD whose diffuser started delaminating.  Once hooked up, the first thing I noticed about the LG was: Wow!  That's an amazing picture!  Comparing the same HD content, the LG was in a whole different league as my old Sharp, even though both are 1080p screens.  The screen is glossier than I would like but this appears to be the trend with new LCDs (the Sharp was a very matte display).  The LG's smart functions seemed like a handy addition and the built-in WiDi (allowing one to display a WiDi enabled computer on the TV) was a nice bonus.  Unfortunately, after using the LG for a couple of weeks, I decided to return it.  There was nothing defective about it but for me, there were some issues that no setting on the TV could eliminate.Issue #1:  Very light / white areas are blown out and therefore detail in them is lost.  No amount of fiddling with backlight, brightness, or contrast settings would produce an image with acceptable light area detail AND acceptable brightness / vibrancy in the rest of the image.Issue #2:  Fast moving images on the screen produce a \"banding\" effect.  My assumption was that, this being a 120Hz screen, the fast motion blurring seen on my old Sharp would be absent here.  It is, but instead you get this odd artifacting that is by far and away less natural than blurring.  No amount of fiddling with the TV's TruMotion settings would eliminate this.  Setting TruMotion to low or off produced images akin to a 60Hz TV but did not eliminate the banding; higher TruMotion settings made images smoother, but made no difference with banding.  And of course, once you see it, you cannot ignore it.Issue #3:  This could very well be a common issue with edge-lit screens but I found that the backlight was uneven and there was light bleed at the very bottom of the screen.  The light bleed is noticeable on dark images and can be minimized by turning down the backlight, but then you start to run into part of the problem in Issue #1.Issue #4:  This may be a defect or within the normal range of things but the left side of the screen was slightly redder than the right (or perhaps the right side was bluer).Issue #5: The TV has a built in function called Picture Wizard that will walk you through a basic calibration.  I have found that when adjusted so that the sample image looks good, actual broadcast images will either be too dark or oversaturated.  Part of the problem is the sample image LG uses in the wizard; it looks like a picture of a classical painting of a man and woman.  There isn't enough area of red, green, and blue to be able to accurately adjust and by the picture's nature, doesn't represent a real world scenario.  A picture of people with different skin tones in a grassy area with plenty of blue sky would make adjustments much easier.I did not get the opportunity to use any of the TV's streaming apps but there are plenty to choose from.  I did try out the WiDi and it worked, but the TV creates it's own pointer which is overlayed on top of the one generated by the computer.  The computer's WiDi settings allow you to shut off the computer pointer which allows you to just use the TV's, but then you lose the context changes (i.e. the pointer turns into a hand when placed over a web link).Ultimately, as a TV, I have too many issues with this LG and returned it. It's quite possible that someone who mostly watches DVD or Blu-Ray would not run into most of these problems.  I wound up purchasing a Vizio E470-A0, also 47\" but a 60Hz model without Wifi, smart functions, or WiDi.

We watched some old black & white \"Twilight Zone\" episodes on a local channel and it looked as if it was in 3D. The definition in remarkable. LED is without a doubt the way to go.The only \"CONS\" I have with the audio, for as much as LG claims to have optimized audio and different equalized settings, as an audiophile they all lacked through the tv speakers. We also own Vizio and Yamaha soundbars which I would recommend to anyone with these new TVs. Having tested a few and been around many others I can tell you it is difficult to get great sound from any TV. Even a cheap sound bar is better than most in stock televisions.The Smart Apps are fantastic, although a little slim. LG should open up more to google play and allow more Android based apps to work, however they do at least have the main video apps such as Amazon Prime Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu, Crackle, and Redbox amongst others. The Youtube app is handy as well for viewing todays crazy videos or (to inform some of you) some movies that the copyright license has ran out and does not apply from the 40s and 50s can be found there to view for free as well as some monthly freebies uploaded by various movie companies.

I guess I will now have to buy a different brand. I just can't make myself pay an extra $54 when I KNOW this TV was sold at the lower price just last week. Also, they are advertising this model as a \"2013\" which I assume means a new 2014 39\" will be coming out soon from LG. That is another reason I'm grumbling about the price and it's hard for me to pay that extra $54 for an old model. I haven't seen any other comments about the price so others must be OK with paying the new March 10% increase for the old model. I guess the motto for me here is \"if you snooze, you lose\".UPDATE 3/13/2014:  When Amazon raised the price of this size/model AGAIN by $20 on 3/9/14, I decided to purchase from Dell.  Amazon has marked up this unit by +15% (or $75) in only a few weeks...at this price point!!!!  YIKES!Dell has this model (39LN5700) with free shipping at a lower cost - a no-brainer for me.  Amazon has been my GO-TO vendor of choice but I'm really disappointed with their pricing of this unit.  Amazon raised the price several times in a few weeks while other vendors did not.  I'm now thinking that I will have to comparison shop for all my other purchases rather than trust that Amazon has the best price.

The first arrived in good condition and the very minor scratches on it which made it a discounted item were worth the $120 savings from Amazon's Warehouse Deals.  We set it up, but a few days later it started to turn off on its own and would turn right back on. The next day it wouldn't even turn on and the red power indicator on the bottom just flickered like a dim candle rather than a steady glow.If you haven't had Amazon call you right away for technical support, I can't recommend it enough. The service rep was very helpful and we tried a couple of things. Then he said he would refund our money and we could see if another warehouse deal was available. There was so we bought a second one.  That one seemed like it hand' ever been opened and perhaps was discounted for a fairly worn box that it arrived it. Still $100 off for a damaged box? I'll take it!Sadly after. Unpacking and pealing all of the protective wrapping off it proceeded to power cycle off and on. Search the reviews here for this problem and you will see this is apparently a common problem. :( We returned the second one and decided not to try a third one.Instead, I went to a local membership store and bought the 40\" Vizio M series tv. They had a $20 instant rebate which made it cheaper than Amazon and even new it was cheaper than the discount LG. Having experience with both, I would say that the pro for the LG was the screen setup wizard. Use that and your tv will be beautiful for your specific environment. What a great system! However after a slightly more tedious trial and error the Vizio looks just as good. The thing that makes the Vizio shine is the apps. They are better, higher resolution, easier access versions of all that came with the LG. For example the Netflix app allows you to use your profiles and the LG only shows the que from the first profile. This is great if you have a profile setup for your kids and one for yourself.I guess I wish I had read this review before buying two of these LG tv's myself...", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Also works as a computer monitor", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Ed Tice\"", "ReviewID": "R9IEVBYZO16GL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't add much onto the other reviews.

When I got the tv it was an easy setup, I had it completely setup and on Netflix about 20 minutes after un-boxing it. The display is great, whether you are watching a 30 minute show, a 2 hour movie or playing video games through the HDMI inputs. The sound quality of the actual built-in speakers is pretty good and doesn't \"need\" a sound bar or external speakers. Hooking up external speakers isn't hard at all, all you have to do is run an optical cable to your stereo receiver or sound bar and then change speaker settings on the input menu and you're ready to go. Navigating on the LG Smart menu is a breeze too. To use apps such as \"Pandora\" or an app that has to be downloaded you have to creat an LG account but it only takes about 5-10 minutes.

One qualifier; it's my first Smart TV. When you setup (a breeze)  this tv, or one like it, don't be disappointed that the settings aren't to your liking right away. It will take you awhile, first to learn about the many settings, then tweaking them till you find a combination to your liking. You will probably never be completely satisfied because there are so many variables. Just find a place you like and go with it for a while. That's what I did.The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the audio settings. The tv speakers themselves are much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews. They will probably satisfy anyone other than an audiophile. The problem I have, occurs when streaming movies (and even some other video) from Netflix.  If you have a home theater setup with 5:1 surround sound, this probably would not be a problem to you. It's the range of sound from very, very, low to very, very loud, on streaming movies that gives me problems - and I'm sure I'm not alone in this. You can be watching a movie when all of a sudden, due to a loud explosion or gunshots or something else, the sound blasts you out of your chair and you scramble for the volume control. Then, in the next scene, people will be whispering or talking very softly and you can't hear them. Again, the trusty volume control. So, if you set the volume low to account for the loud sounds, you can't hear low or even normal sounds - and vice-versa. The reason for this, I think, is the way audio engineers set up the sound to fill a movie theater - which is a lot bigger than my living room.A fairly simple way exists to adjust the sound. It's called a Dynamic Range Compressor (DRC) or Limiter. It brings the high end and the low end closer together and then squashes it giving you better volume control. I think they could fix this with a simple software upgrade but LG, or Netflix, for that matter, have not seen fit to incorporate it - yet.  Wait, lest I speak to soon. I just downloaded a software upgrade from LG and it is possible they have fixed the problem. I'm sure they will sooner of later. That is why I gave 4 stars and not five.

Color and picture look really nice, I can even dare to say it can easily compete with higher end tv sets, here you have a lot of settings to adjust picture and color. Something personal possibly available in other sets different than LG too, what  I like about this set is its \"Now on Tv\" which is a listing from Smart TV with all your cable programming listed with pictures frames so it makes really easy to chose the show or program you want to watch. Another feature is \"vTuner\" where you can listen radio from any country.

Although the picture is not as wonderful as that of my recently failed 8-year-old 42-inch Pioneer plasma, I have been able to obtain acceptable results by establishing different and easily accessible settings for the type of program to be viewed (sports, documentary, TV series, news, etc.).But I am concerned about the claim that this set features a 120hz refresh rate. The info bar which appears when the set is turned on states that it is 60hz, and I have been unable to change that after making every conceivable adjustment allowed in the video settings.Is this 120hz claim an error in the advertising appearing on Amazon.com, or a deliberate misrepresentation made by the manufacturer or distributor which Amazon.com continues to ignore? Incidentally, at least one other reviewer has reported this issue.If an adjustment is available to obtain 120hz performance, I would appreciate knowing about it. If this set is limited to a 60hz refresh rate, then I would have more confidence in Amazon.com's future advertising if this misrepresentation is corrected.ADDED 10/17/2013: All the above discussion re: 60hz/120hz refresh rate should be disregarded (see comments, which I have allowed to remain for the benefit of others as uninformed as I've been).

Its bright, the picture is fantastic, sound quality is not bad. The only thing that was disappointing was there is no red white audio (analog) out on this tv only optical out (digital). My external speakers that I bought a few years back only have the analog audio so I had to buy a digital to analog converter ($60) and an optical cable to hook up my speakers. It works most of the time but for some applications the audio is out of sync with the video, a problem that i think can be attributed to the converter.Most of the newer external speakers you can buy now are upgraded to digital sound so this might not be an issue for some people. The tv speakers are not bad if you dont have an external sound system. Just note that the tv speakers and an external sound system cannot be used at the same time on this tv. You can only use one or the other (but its pretty easy to switch between them).Also this tv does not come with the magic remote but if you have a smart phone you can get a free app that basically turns your phone into the smart remote.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Michael J.

Everything is awesome about this TV, its picture is stunning.  The sound isnt even as bad as I was expecting based on reviews of LCD TV's in general.Why I knocked off a few stars...First, I initially hooked this TV up as an internet device only, in the bedroom for netflix while a living room remodel takes place.  Every now and then there is a very fast, but noticeable flicker.  I did a little research, im not to bad at google-fu, but most posts pointed to the issue being just changes in light to dark and the auto adjusts built into the tv.  I did a little menu exploring and turned those settings off, and the issue has not improved.  Im not sure if its just how TVs of this size work, there arent a lot of posts about it.  I dont know if there is something wrong with the unit, or its just how its supposed to be.  The second star is because LG is not exactly easy to work with.

I rarely have connection stuttering problems these days, so given the value of this now somewhat reliable product, I am a happier customer...Original review:This would be a much better product if they had focused on getting some of the details right. I'm spoiled by Apple's system integration and user interfaces, so I get annoyed when I have to re-enter my Wifi password multiple times because the UI makes it easy to make typos. This wouldn't be such a big problem but the Wifi radio seems cheap and isn't well integrated with the OS. I can run the Netflix app on my iPad in the same room as the TV and there is never any hiccups on the ipad. However, the TV frequently needs to buffer and just randomly loses networking. I often have to reboot my router and then turn the TV back on, after which it streams fine. This does not happen on any of my mobile devices, my Roku, or my Smart BLUray player. Periodically none of the networking works mysteriously and then after a few minutes of fumbling, I am required to agree to the terms of service, after which the TV works okay again. The bottom line is that this is just a product that meets my needs but is kind of annoying. In other words, it doesn't \"just work\" which is the standard set by Apple. However, the price is right. I would not buy another of these in the future but would probably pay a little more for one with better hardware/software. Running a cable would probably solve a lot of my problems, but I bought this TV because I can't run a cable (through brick/stone).", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "J.

You can use the stereo jack or TOSLINK connector on the back to drive a home theatre amp or an external sound bar for much better results.Also like most modern TVs, this one does the automatic image interpolation that makes everything you watch look like a soap opera.

But thanks, buddy, your review is what pushed me into the final decision to buy the LG 47\" LED model 47LN5700.  We are what you might call an \"LG Family\".  Within the past few years we have acquired (in order) an LG washer, LG dryer, three door LG refrigerator, two LG cell phones and now an LG large screen television.  None of these products has ever given us the slightest problem.  We (my wife and I are each 70 years old) are LG for life!Now for the TV.  Briefly, it has the best picture that we've ever seen!  Although we did not opt for the 3D model, nor did we opt for the Magic Remote, the picture quality and ease of use is fantastic!  It set up quickly and easily. The set faces an outside wall with a large set of windows that are on the west side of our room.  That means the amount of brightness between noon and sunset is huge.  With our previous set, a Phillips 50\" plasma, we actually had to close the blinds and even then had difficulty seeing the image.  The LG 47LN5700 has very strong picture brightness and contrast (combined with the flat screen finish) so that glare is NEVER a problem.  In spite of the light level in the room, the image is very easily viewed.  Once the sun sets and the room darkens, the image automatically adjusts and the picture quality is still first-rate.  In fact, throughout the brightness spectrum the HD picture almost looks to be 3D.  Even older programs appear to be near-HD quality.Finally, the Smart TV aspect of the set is really exciting and easy to use.  We have Pandora, YouTube, and Netflix as well as MLB.TV active.  We have downloaded a number of apps already.  We use the web access to review emails and surf the web.  The plug'n'play aspect of the USB input means that we are able to video our grandson's baseball games and our granddaughter's swim meets on our little flip video camera, come home and plug it in to the LG USB port, watch and listen to the action.  Fantastic!!!  And we've only had the set for five days!  Can't wait to see what the next few weeks bring.  This product will change our entire concept of home entertainment.

The picture seems to be more vivid even though both are HD televisions.  I also love that this one is a Smart Tv where you can search the web, check facebook, play games, and use other apps that are preloaded or pick new apps. Web was very easy to get to and search.Setup was very easy and I had it hooked up in no time.  If you use the inluded stand there are 7 screws to attach to connect the stand to the TV.  But that took no time at all.  Also connecting the wires was very easy and the Tv weight is about 30 lbs so it is very light to pickup and place on a stand or a console.The Tv setup is very easy and walks you through setting up your language, time, and channel settings.  This is also made easier with the very comfortable and user freiendly remote.  Also if there is a system update to the TV you can still watch Tv while it downloads the update you just need to reset it after it completes download for the update to take effect.The Tv picture is very crisp and I love the sound of the Tv by itself it does have settings to switch between to a Cinema or Game sound which are very useful when watching movies or playing games.Overall I am very pleased with the picture and sound of the Tv.  I watched over the air Tv, Avatar, Cars, and Planet Earth to sample and the quality of all were excellent.  I would definetly recommend this Tv.

All is not lost, however, the LG has its own browser so I can (slowly) surf the www.Edit Jan 25, 2014: The LG unit has started exhibiting some bizarre behavior. When I turn it on, the LG logo shows for about a second, then the screen goes dark, then the LG logo appears for another second, then the screen goes dark, etc. This repetitive behavior goes through many cycles; the most I have counted so far is thirty-one (31). After \"enough\" cycles, the LG behaves in a normal manner.Edit Feb 12, 2013: I scheduled a repair session (under warranty) to fix the cycling problem. The technician replaced the power cable connecting the main & power boards. That solved the cycling problem. The technician said this was a fairly common problem with LGs. From my verbal description of the problem he had ordered the cable and then brought it with him on his visit. The technician also solved my problems using the LG as a computer monitor by changing various settings. The LG warranty service appointment was painless to set up and satisfactorily solved my problems.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Smart TV", "Author": "Linda Rucker", "ReviewID": "RBGE0C0HQ4BVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my HD Smart TV best TV I have ever had.I would recommend this TV to everyone great quality", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tv", "Author": "Nancy Graves", "ReviewID": "R2C15JHBQPLO3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far we have enjoyed many things about this TVThe picture is outstanding, and the 40\" size fits perfectly in our oak entertainment centerI had a hard time finding that sizeWould recommend this to everyoneThe wireless is really great too, but we are still learning about that technology", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply the best TV in it's class", "Author": "Paul F.

It's not gonna give you the wall rattling of a big subwoofer if that's what you're in to but it definitely is loud enough with clear sound. To take advantage of the great picture quality you will want to use hdmi cables and check with your cable provider on getting hd channels. I know for my cable provider it makes a big difference if I'm watching the regular channels vs. the hd versions of the channels (it's about 2 1/2 times the resolution).Also, the build in wifi is awesome. You can access your netflix, hulu, etc. or even just search the web, maybe watch youtube videos, with one click of the remote. I haven't gotten the magic remote yet, but it seems like it would be a nice accessory. When you're surfing the web you use the arrows on the remote to move the cursor and it can be a little time consuming. That's when the magic remote would be nice because from what I understand, you just point and click.My only real complaint is sometimes when I access the web, the cursor doesn't show up so I cannot select anything or even select the browser to start typing the website. So, far I've just exited the smart tv feature and selected it again and it usually shows up (but once in awhile it does take a couple of times doing this).Overall, excellent tv for the price.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "What a TV should be", "Author": "S.

I had been doing exhaustive research into various brands and features. I decided on the 47\" LG model number LN5700. I placed the order to arrive the day before my wife got home. It arrived as promised and after assembling the stand and hooking the cables, I turned it on wanted to be wowed....but nothing....a mostly black screen with bluish lines running through it like rivers on a map. I called LG support and they walked me through a few steps with no results. They then set up a service appointment for the following day. The serviceman looked at it and immediately said the screen was broken from the inside and not covered by the warranty. I called Amazon explained the situation to them and they said I could get a refund or replacement. I opted for replacement and they overnighted it to me with no charge. They also arranged to have the broken TV picked up. Amazon and LG were terrific through this whole ordeal.Now the TV.....Opened the new one and the set up was very easy. The picture is easily set to your preferences and after going back and forth experimenting you're sure to find a beautiful picture. I have another LG and the new one's picture is better than I expected. The LED-LCD seems to be a much better picture technology. The sound is very good without a soundbar although I will probably add one.This TV has the Smart TV Technology and I am not sure whether this was necessary or not. The TV is still new and I haven't experimented with the Smart TV options. I'll update when more information is available.Overall I love watching this TV and am continually impressed with the clarity and color of the picture.

Had never owned any LG products, and I have to say that I never like the brand - can't really say why. The fact is that the operating system was amazing, Changing channels was rather fast, menu options were easy to navigate and understand, good sound, etc. I think that is THE main reason why now, when getting a smart TV, I wanted LG. The smart TV functions are mind-blowing, the internet browser supports flash, which allows me to watch embedded videos (no other TV I've tried supports that), it has great sound, great colors.

We have a 42\" plasma, which is the standard I'm comparing this to. The black is not a black on this LED-LCD as on the plasma, but otherwise the picture is very fine.The sound is decent for a flat screen TV. I'm perfectly content with it as is and won't bother installing any external speakers or a sound bar--they're too fussy for me, and typically involve a second remote. No thanks.It's surprisingly light, much lighter than the smaller plasma. Mounting it on the wall is a one-man operation. Also, the frame bezel is quite thin, so thin that it doesn't look very imposing. Once it was on the wall, I had to check the box to make sure it really was a 50\" screen (it is)--because it doesn't seem much larger than the 42\" plasma, which has a much thinker bezel. It's quite an interesting effect, a small TV, but a huge screen.The \"smart\" features are easy to use, and setup is a breeze. No technical genius is needed. You don't even need to read the manual. Setting the audio and visual characteristics is a little more complicated, but it's not at all challenging to work through the menus. It can even be vaguely entertaining. The default settings make everything look like a soap-opera or a PS4 game. But it's easy to fix that just by choosing Cinema mode or Game mode.

Built-in WiFi is very useful and extremely easy to set up. Using the keyboard on the TV is a hassle with the remote; however, I would recommend everyone to download the \"LG TV Remote\" app (I have an android) on their smartphone and you can use your cell phone as a mouse! It made our lives so easy once we figured that out.The reason I had to take off a star is because after about 4 months use, our TV broke down. We called LG Support. They were very helpful and dispatched a technician fast. It turns out the motherboard somehow fried itself. Nobody had any explanation on why this happened. In any case, it is fixed now (although, we had to wait for the part to arrive for about a week) and has been working fine since. The TV comes with 1-yr manufacturer's warranty.

The picture couldn't be clearer. I read reviews of a lot of other brands complaining about ghosting. This happens when you are watching something like football and the picture is trying to keep up with a football that is mid air after being passed by the quarterback. You see the image of where it is, plus the fading image of where it  just was a split second ago.So far I have not seen any of this at all with this TV. The only thing I have reservations about is this. It is a \"smart\" TV. That means is has a computer within the cabinet of the TV. On things that don't require much memory, it is fine, but it is supposed to be able to show anything you normally get on a computer. The memory in it can't be much. If you try to watch a movie like on Amazon Prime, the picture never comes up. Finally an error screen comes up telling you that there is not enough memory. I am trying to find out if I can add memory, like you do on a computer, but so far no luck finding out. I guess I'm going to have to talk to LG themselves.One other thing. The remote is the most mickey mouse thing I have ever seen. The most aggravating thing is that you almost have to attach a level to the remote. I mean to tell ya, if that sucker ain't perfectly level, it don't want to work. My old satellite remote will let you cock it almost to a 45 degree angle up, down, or side to side  before it gives up, but not this thing.

The instructions are typical in that they tell you not to tighten the screws too much or too little.

Haggard", "ReviewID": "R1TM6DV7LC4YNY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATED REVIEWI have had this TV for just under 2 weeks. It worked perfectly and all of a sudden tonight it started to reboot itself constantly. Sometimes it would stay on for 5 minutes, other times it would reboot after seconds and it got stuck in a loop. I tried resetting the TV, I tried unplugging the TV, I tried a number of \"tricks\" and finally called LG support. They are sending a tech out to my house to check on the TV.This may just be bad luck that this TV died so quick, but I have never had an issue with a TV this soon after receiving it. I appreciate LG sending a tech out, but the fact is I shouldn't have needed to call for support this soon. Also, LG gave me a 4 hour window for a tech to come out. Would be nicer if they could narrow down a time window so I don't have to take off half a day from work.I would consider this TV a don't buy at this point. It is far to expensive and the quality of the unit I received is lacking. Below is my original review where I recommend a different model. LG support is stepping up, but the fact is I have a $600 TV that died in less then 2 weeks and now have to have a tech come to my house.Once the tech arrives I'll update this review.--------------My original reviewLet me start by saying I received a unit to review.The TV arrived via UPS, the box itself was a bit damaged but the TV was not damaged.Upon unpacking there are 3 parts. The Main screen, the bottom of the stand and the bracket that goes on the back of the tv and attaches to the base of the stand.All together it takes 7 screws to put the TV together, make sure you have a philips screwdriver with a medium to long handle.Once the TV is assembled it's sturdy, the TV is replacing an old 32\" flat screen that is around 8 years old, this new TV even at 10\" bigger screen size weighs 1/3 the weight. This thing is light!The display looks great. Its really clear even in standard def. When first turning the TV on it walks you through a setup process. It actually has a calibration mode it goes through as well where it asks you to tweak settings like sharpness, contrast, brightness, etc.When using the TV in standard mode (non-hd connections) it looks good and sounds great. When hooking it up to the internet to stream video which may be HD the TV has a really fast \"motion\" to it, almost like the video is fast forwarding while the audio is normal speed. This is not something I observed in standard TV mode, only when using online apps. I tried several video apps on the TV and they all did the same weird effect. I went into settings turned off all motion controls, etc to try to resolve and it still looks weird. I also tried streaming video ranging from SD to HD to the super HD that vudu has.  Now this isn't a router issue, I tested using the onboard speed test app within vudu and it showed I had optimal connections so this has to be a TV issue. Sadly, there was not an Amazon Instant Video app when I looked so I couldn't test that video.So, for standard TV viewing, HD, as well as BluRay it works great. For online, I had a weird video speed issue although the video did start playing very quickly.Also, the app store. Sure this thing has a lot of apps but none I use. I looked for Plex, it wasn't available (but plex is supported through upnp which the TV does have), I looked for NHL game center, not there. Xfinity TV not present. Want to watch amazon instant video? Can't do it here. There really is not a large selection of popular apps I find useful on the TV. I am no gamer so the hundreds of games don't do it for me. I will add though the TV menus and smart app screens are really snappy with almost no lag when moving between them, I'm guessing thanks to the dual core technology. I did have one instance when the entire menu locked up and I let it sit for a few minutes and it finally responded but that was only one time.Also, there is a \"magic remote\" that will allow you to control your cable box.... But it's sold seperately. For a TV of this size (42\") to cost in the $600 range and NOT include this smarter remote is obscene. You can buy the same size TV from Vizio (VIZIO E420i-A1 42-inch 1080p 120Hz LED Smart HDTV) for several hundred less. I will add I have a 60\" vizio LED and love it so Vizio is a good brand.I just can't recommend you spend $600+ on this TV from LG. Yes it looks good, yes it is light weight, yes it is \"smart\" but it doesn't warrant a premium price tag in my opinion. If you are loyal to the LG brand you'll want to get this. If you are looking for a great TV at a reasonable cost then I would recommend you pass on this TV and instead go with the other one mentioned.If LG were to include the smart remote then that would help justify a little of the cost. If there was a larger selection of apps available that would help. Overall though the value just doesn't make sense for me to choose this over a competitor. For the reasons stated above I'm giving it a 3, I like it because it is a good TV, but the price is what really doesn't work for me and makes me knock off a few stars.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Easy Reader \"Berti\"", "ReviewID": "R3CPJM37P62LNT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the price, the picture, the clever smart options.

In my lengthy internet & telephone search I happened upon a review of the LG5700by Crutchfield electronics who listed the lowly headphone outlet as a feature on this model. To be sure I called and was told it was true, the helpful person even double checked a visual layout of the back of the TV.  I was so grateful I would have bought it from them if I could afford a new one, but I needed to buy used to get this higher end TV with the seemingly extinct outlet.In my research I learned a lot of people would like this option, for many different reasons.I had learned way down the road that there was a solution via an adapter that can be connected to the digital optical/audio output outlet but that required 2 cables and a jack connector to hook it up. Totaling a 4 part purchase and more crap around the TV, on top of which you could not control the volume with the remote. To remedy that you needed wireless headphones with volume control in them (expensive & bulky) or buy small volume controls you plug your headphones or ear buds into. These are only $10.00 at Radio Shack but you have more wires to get tangled in.We had the LG425400 which we returned when by not giving up,I found the 5700 had the headphone outlet. LG claims they are the exact same except for the smart features but there is a difference in the bezel which is a mat finish instead of shiny. The back is a little different in that it has a 3rd HDMI outlet & of course the headphone outlet. So its obvious more has been done than just adding the smart options, the picture seems a little better and the remote is nicer.Set up is more complicated with the wireless because its less familiar but between LG but mainly the cable company it was OK. The big tip was using the ethernet cable way of connectingAfter all I am glad to have the smart TV, less wires and a Roku box we can now use elsewhere , it was a very long journey of hours spent and loads of misinformation to slog through, I know too much about TVs at this point,I sure hope this helps some other poor slob out there in Gizmo Land.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great picture, frate rate isn't ideal for 120Hz", "Author": "seprice", "ReviewID": "R2V4JD6OU855TQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a really strong 1080p HDTV, the picture looks fantastic with practically every kind of content.

The built in speakers leave a lot to be desired, the sound will echo & crackle a lot of course from what I've read and observed from comparable TV's. It would be great if the MAGIC Remote was included cause I'm NOT spending $80 on a remote when I have to buy a quality sound bar or home theater system to have passable audio. I'm not a picture snob, I set up a custom profile that works good for TV, Movies & Gaming, yeah sometimes it has to be altered a bit depending what I'm watching or playing but that takes all of 2 or 3 minutes to do. The SMART TV Menu & Apps are great, like everything else out there you get Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon, Facebook etc... What I really like is that it's a very easy to navigate, for the past 18 months I had a 42\" Vizio M421VT which is a very dumb SMART TV, the menu is extremely rough and takes a while to navigate, thankfully after dealing with many issues with that TV, Square Trade has seen fit to cut me a check for the original purchase price & let me replace it with something new. If I could merge one thing from either of my old Vizio TV's into my LG 50LN5700 it would be the built in speakers.Now that I'm going to be buying a TV to replace the Vizio M421VT (The Master Bedroom TV) I've got to find something that has a great picture and good built in sound cause I'm not putting a surround sound system in my bedroom, it's for this reason that I won't be buying a 42 or 47 inch LN5700. The LN5700 uses Direct LED which so far seems to produce a better picture, I've read lots of pros & cons to both Edge lit & Direct LED, my dead Vizio M421VT was a Edge Lit TV and the picture was good, but it did sometimes have trouble with some finer images.Overall I think the 50LN5700 was the right choice for our family room, it's a little bigger than the previous TV, the picture is much better & we now have the ability to stream video content on the TV without having to power up a gaming console to do so. The WiDi function is also pretty cool, so far I've only used it to do a slide show of vacation pictures from my iPhone, but I understand I can do much more with this feature and will enjoy exploring this further.If necessary I will update my review and rating of this TV as I see fit.I hope this can be of use to someone making a choice on a new TV for the holiday season.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG 50LN5700...bad investment", "Author": "Amresh Singh", "ReviewID": "R13JJS4ZI189YL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this tv 2 days back but from the movement I switched ON for first time I felt that Sound is not good.

You can't mix and match the two so if you want to make a \"card\" with just your local file server, Netflix and the few apps you use - tough luck.

A product for which I had high expectations, is such a disappointing television. LG has a reputation for manufacturing quality electronics and I've had positive experiences in the past. The major issue is that the default screen setting is a picture width far wider than the screen. Why did I purchase a 47\" TV for 25 percent of the screen area to have no picture?Under the \"Zoom\" aspect ratio, the picture nearly fills the screen. But part of the picture is lost (hence the name) and the motion is choppy -- especially with sporting events. I will concede that I'm far from a technology expert. So maybe there is a way to fix this issue. But that's not exactly relevant, since the majority of the purchasers of this product likely have similar skills and knowledge.The sound is terrible. This is not up for discussion. If you intended to purchase speakers or connect it to a surround-sound system, then this is not an issue. However, there are some consumers who expect to use the TV as manufactured. Apparently LG does not understand this.Most of my frustration is derived from the decline in overall quality from previous versions of this TV. A friend owns a similar one that is 1-2 years older. Great product; excellent sound and picture. Consumers expect quality to increase as technology advances. The \"smart\" features are certainly great. But they are far from worth the decline in sound and picture quality.I suppose the massive discounts offered by Amazon for the product should have been a red flag.

LG is acting like the NSA of South Korea.  So if you do not want your personal information collected, either do not buy this TV, or do not connect it to the internet.  That begs the question:why spend more for an internet ready TV?Furthermore, LG sends all TVs out with a configuration setting \"Collection of watching info\".enabled.  This can be set to either ON or OFF. So you would think setting to off would stop the spying.  The answer is NO!  The same information is collected and sent to LG.  The only difference is a status bit is switched from 1 to 0 but the information is still being sent.According to Mr. Huntley, an IT consultant who published the article, LG's response is that \"by using the TV he had accepted LG's terms and conditions, and that any remaining concerns should be directed to the retailer who had sold him the screen.\"  So for me, that was Amazon and I am contacting them by this review.Without the SPYWARE problem, I would have rated the TV a solid 4 to 5 stars.

The channels will be reversed. Left is coming out on the right side, and right on the left.Step 4: Even worse, now try using optical out. The channels will *still* be reversed.

How do you mix up this wiring??

I set the Clear Voice option on max to get good enough results. but. I might need to get a soundbar or something. Though I think its a software Issue. They need to fix it. overall. Great picture and video quality. the Smart tv features are awesome. the DLNA is the best in any smart tv. access multiple file types from any connected PC (to your router). I also recommend wired internet connection. WIFI speeds are not good enough for streaming. as it is 2.4 GHZ. not 5 GHZ.(even then. wouldn't be good enough). little sound problem that can be partially solved with some optimization. and you've good yourself a big screen. don't go with other brands. I've always bought LG  TV's. they're the best. gaming is great. my PS3 is 1080P on this thing. they could have added  DVI-SUB or a VGA connector for PC. would have been very very useful.

I recommend to completely shut it off and then adjust the brightness and backlit as you desire. I have them both at 50. while i had them at 90/100 with minimal Eco. thats why i shut them off.this TV is great for streaming. no need for a streaming device. after all. its a smart TV. the sharing is awesome. I can acess digital videos, music , photos on other PCs in my network. web browsing is great. the main purpose of it is as a TV and its great for that alone. but as a smart TV. you don'y have to connect a PC to it to view all the content you have. one thing they could have done is more Inputs.  An extra HDMI jack would on the other side would have been great. but 3 isn't bad after all. am currently using 2 of them. you might want to look to other options if you have a gaming console, HDTV box and a gaming console. this will be good for 3 devices. but you never know if you need an extra one.by the way. it has an 3.5 MM audio output + the digital toslink output. but you need a receiver for the digital output. if you have a speaker set that has a 3.5 mm aux input. it will be good for this. as the sound on this TV has some problems. not big problems. but some \" i can deal with it\" problems.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Kelley O'Brien", "ReviewID": "R1U3G0LL8GJNMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this TV!

It's quite easy to mess up the brightness/contrast combination so that you get weird visuals.  The TV has a built-in showroom display option, so it's likely that the screen is overdriven in the store to make it look brighter than it will appear in your house.  Second, there is some haloing and pixelation around finer details on the screen, which are much more obvious up close (the hands of talking heads are a good example), though this may be typical for all larger HDTVs.

The \"Best Buy\" warranty offers replacement for a month only, so we were forced to deal with the LG service people.  What a nightmare.Service means they refer you to the closest subcontractor;  that is it.  In Nova Scotia they have one contractor, a two man shop an hour (plus) from my home.  They ordered the mother board.  A week later it had not arrived.  I had to call LG to complain and managed to get a board shipped out Purolator, in time for Thanksgiving.  I was irked by the fact that (again) the onus was on me to determine that the part had not been delivered, and to initiate a special delivery.Now I am dealing with the repair guys' vacation schedules.  That may seem to be a separate issue, although I still contend that LG should be the ones to ensure availability and delivery of prompt service (even if that means having two shops in the province).I bought the unit because it was highly rated high for reliability.  Sadly I got the lemon, and have learned that LG's definition of \"service\" differs greatly from mine.  I feel that on a 4.5 month old TV they should be the ones to coordinate and supply quality service, and promptly.  The earliest we will see the repair guy will be at the 3.5 week point.If they are unable to deliver that service perhaps there should be an option to get a new box or a refund.Based on this experience I can never buy another LG product.November 30.

The data appeared to show a device ID unique to his set, along with the name of the channel it was tuned to. In his tests, the information was sent in the clear every time the channel was changed. Even more remarkable, he said, the smart TV sent the data even after he waded through the system preferences and set the \"Collection of watching info\" setting to \"off\" (it was on by default).But the logging didn't stop there. Included in the traffic sent over the Internet were the names of files stored on a USB drive connected to the LG television. For dramatic purposes and to ensure he chose a file name not likely used by the firmware, he created a mock video file called Midget_Porn_2013.avi, loaded it onto a USB drive and plugged it into his TV. Sure enough, the file name was transmitted unencrypted in HTTP traffic sent to the address GB.smartshare.lgtvsdp.com. In some cases, he said, file names for an entire folder were transmitted, and other times nothing at all was sent. He never determined the rules that controlled when data was or wasn't sent.\"much more in articlearstechnica.com/security/2013/11/smart-tv-from-lg-phones-home-with-users-viewing-habits-usb-file-names/", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Warehouse Deals = Bad Idea", "Author": "Richard Hagen", "ReviewID": "R31SL9JNS1RBP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would suggest buying this TV new and not through Warehouse deals.

I just spent about 3 weekends remodeling my living room.  My reward for all my hard work was a tv.  I have been saving my cash for a couple years, waiting for the best deal and for the tvs to improve . After reading the reviews I had narrowed it down to 3 tvs.  The LG 55 inch went on sale and it was several hundred dollars cheaper than my number 1 and about the same as my number two so I bought it. Got it home, hooked it up and mounted it to the wall.  Spent the next couple days adjusting the picture, sound etc.... Can you say buyers remorse.  I HATED IT.  I had saved up my money and this is what I got.  I would rather cut a hole in my wall and install my 10 yr old toshiba.  The picture had very bad judder with normal drama tv shows, oh yes I did research and did the trumotion off, and adjusted the other settings, also the sound, my cell phone has better sound than this tv.  On the 3rd day I decided I could not and would not keep this tv. I returned it and got a Sony.  MUCH happier!!!! So in the end if you are blind and deaf and don't mind throwing your money away buy this tv.  If you value your money buy something of better quality, sony,samsung,panasonic, anything else than this LG.  Also I think a company selling this tv and advertising it as 120hz should be sued. It would not pass as a 50 hz if there were such a tv. I hope I got my point across. Future buyer you were warned.  I wish others would have been honest in there reviews and I would not have spent a day taking my tv down, repackaging it and driving 60 miles to return it!!!!", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOULD APPRECIATE MORE AUDIO OUT PROVISIONS.", "Author": "EDWARD J.

For that matter, a number of the usual functions/capabilities I've come to expect from a TV are not supported; you can only consistently get program information if you use a \"cable box\" (I get program info for 2 channels out of nearly 100), the channels are laid out based on source (TV/DTV) so 2.0 is 70 channels away from 2.1, and there is no \"back\" capability to go back to the last channel viewed (my previous TV allowed setting up to 4 channels for surf/back capability, which worked great for college football Saturday). so, generally, I'm hoping this LG dies soon so I can justify going back to a Sony Bravia to my wife.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not the same tv as in the store", "Author": "Carlos J.

This information is collected as part of the Smart TV platform to deliver more relevant advertisements and to offer recommendations to viewers based on what other LG Smart TV owners are watching. We have verified that even when this function is turned off by the viewers, it continues to transmit viewing information although the data is not retained by the server. A firmware update is being prepared for immediate rollout that will correct this problem on all affected LG Smart TVs so when this feature is disabled, no data will be transmitted. It has also been reported that the names of media files stored on external drives such as USB flash devices are being collected by LG Smart TVs. While the file names are not stored, the transmission of such file names was part of a new feature being readied to search for data from the internet (metadata) related to the program being watched in order to deliver a better viewing experience. This feature, however, was never fully implemented and no personal data was ever collected or retained. This feature will also be removed from affected LG Smart TVs with the firmware update. LG regrets any concerns these reports may have caused and will continue to strive to meet the expectations of all our customers and the public. We hope this update clears up any confusion.LG: It will be taken off soon.\"I disagree that this is not personal information.
