When it dies, you might think \"Coby will send a repair person to my home to fix it because that's what the warranty says,\" but you would quickly find out just how wrong you are.  Coby does not provide in-home service, and any claims they make regarding shipping your defective TV to them for repair are nothing more than an exercise in frustration.  It appears this company is circling the drain and may be out of business any time soon, so don't buy any Coby product unless you're prepared to deal with any problems entirely on your own.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Deliver the next-generation of home theater to your customers\nExperience high-resolution 3D with active-shutter technology\nActive-shutter 3D glasses included\nAdvanced 120 Hz motion engine generates lightning-fast video while reducing motion blur\nEnjoy video in stunning high-resolution 1080p", "Name": "Coby 40-Inch 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Two Pairs of 3D Glasses", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-Mst5bJBL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004IZN3LG"}}
