I have contacted Philips and they have been completely unsatisfactory. I have since googled and found hundreds of consumers who have had the same problem and recieved horrible customer service. I expect a brand new tv to last longer than 2 months.I don't know how they manage to stay in business with this type of product and lack of customer service.

It had a sharper picture and more depth of image than any of the others. Pixel Plus 2 HD, which is Philip's image processing utility, is what did the trick. The picture quality was just slightly better than the others but with Pixel Plus 2 HD turned on it was considerably better than the others. I usually prefer Sony XBR models but the picture quality won me over. With a 6 millisecond response time and a 6000:1 contrast ratio the specs are excellent. In addition blacks are black on this TV. The outer space scenes in Star Wars are deep black. The audio has been criticized but there is a graphic equalizer down in the menu to boost the high frequencies. Doing this makes the audio more than acceptable. In addition to contrast, brightness, sharpness etc. this TV has extensive capabilities in the picture menu which include Dynamic contrast, signal processing, active control, color enhancement and digital noise reduction. Signal processing turns Pixel Plus on or off. DNR or digital noise reduction works extremely well as it doesn't seen to affect sharpness at all. The other items modify the image constantly with each frame to produce a stunning picture. I've had the set now for almost six months with absolutely no problems. The picture quality from DVD's or OTA broadcasts in 720p or 1080i look fantastic. I can't say enough about this TV. I bought it primarily for the picture quality and I'm completely satisfied.", "Date": "April 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "watch out for overheating problem", "Author": "J.

I talked with Philips and they said the video board is damaged due to overheating.  Philips' service guy told me this problem right away, which tells me that they have seen this problem more than a few times.

Maybe a light behind the TV would be as good, but I don't think so.The picture is sharp and crisp and the different formats make viewing non-HD channels that much easier.The speakers are in need of an upgrade they are tinny and have no bottom, if not for the surround system, this TV would have went back to the supplier.  In addtion there is no way to turn them off, with the SONY I could turn off the TV speakers and opt for the output only which helps in TV watching.All in all its a great upgrade.", "Date": "June 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "*edit (5 years later) AMBILIGHT ROCKS", "Author": "Bobby DIgital \"bobby digital\"", "ReviewID": "R2GAVGTNNQCSCJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its been 5 years no problems - i leave it on alot even through the night alot.

Picture is fantastic, ambilight is beautiful. Reliability terrible. After 12 months & 2 weeks (of course after manufacturers warranty expired) it failed. TV will not turn on and picture would go black while it was on. Controls wouldn't work either on remote or physically on TV. To turn it off we had to unplug it. TV has extended warranty but we have been waiting for parts for over a month. Service people say Power Supply on TV is bad.

It was $1200 at the time, and held its own with all but the $2500 Pioneer and Sony sets.As of 1/18/12 it's still going strong, and has recently been relegated to Garage Duty, being that I picked up a new LG.I love ambilight feature.  Some call it Gimmicky, but it does ease eye strain when watching TV.  I with newer sets offered this feature.The one down side is the Audio....quite possibly the worst I've ever heard from a TV.  I have a 5.1 Surround Setup (and a 2.1 setup in the garage), so this was not a concern of mine.  For that, minus 1 star.This has been a great TV and woth every penny that I paid for it.  I can only hope to get another 5 years from it in the garage.MP", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "TV Dies After1 Year", "Author": "William A.

This tv has seen a lot of hours of use on a variety of viewing settings and held up well.  It just recently started to develop 1 inch long 1/8 inch wide vertical lines at the top of the screen that only show in the dark colors.  That being said the average lifespan for an LCD tv is 5 years so I'm not terrible dissapointed, plus there is a lot better televisions on the market.  I love the ambilight but it really only makes a difference in a dark room or at night but does add to the atmosphere.  I would recommend this product if they still made it.
