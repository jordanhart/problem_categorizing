Picture is sharp and colors are good once you do some calibration. Picture blurs a bit on the side views, but I got the television for a small bedroom, where I am looking straight on or close to straight on most of the time. Sound is great for such a small television and out produces my 32 inch LED LG television for sound. A DVD movie looked sharp too. Super thin design and looks cool. Really looks like a thin computer monitor more than a tv. JVC says that the television will use less power too.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Sound, Horredous Picture and Colors", "Author": "K MavAZ", "ReviewID": "R258A8O29EE1HF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV and I must admit it is the best sounding TV in it's class. Comes complete with a 7 band equalizer; volume is more than adequate. Now the unacceptable attribute. The color is hideous. Everything has a vivid, unrealistic ORANGE hue. The only way to make the set viewable is extensive tweaking of the picture in custom mode. Even then the picture still likes to add that extra orange colored element. I will return this one and re order one more hoping this is just a bad unit however I have found numerous other consumers with the same problem. Upon further investigation I have discovered JVC is serviced by Orion and this unit is identical to a Sansui. JVC doesn't even include this model on their website. This would NOT be my first choice.Update 2/21/12: I did not replace this JVC with a new one. I took advantage of a sale at a Buy Store on a 24\" Insignia built by Samsung. This new LED TV uses 31kwh and the picture is Amazing, the audio is crisp and clear. Absolutely no comparison between the two tvs.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Oompa Loompa Picture", "Author": "Edani", "ReviewID": "RDZFF6O063EPS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought 2 of these TV's.  One was a gift, while we kept the other.  BOTH have horrible orange tints to the picture.  The quality is well below the advertised 1080p. The one that was a gift was actually RETURNED it was so bad. JVC is officially of my list for all future purchases.Save yourself the disappointment and pass on this one.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Luke", "ReviewID": "R36VE7DNXF2I9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this tv for christmas to replace an old trutech crt tv, and I have no idea what these customers are complaining about because I have absolutely loved the tv since I got it! I wouldn't reccomend watching it for just tv as your really getting nothing out of it if your using the old analog port that only puts out 480i, but for gaming at 1080p, I have no complaints. Colors are fantastic when fed through anything but the analog port (tv stations have always had very terrible colors in my opinion), and really it's just a good tv for anyone that is on a budget. To get the most out of this though, you would definetly want to get an HD Box for watching television, but for a gamer, it's perfect.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Uhhh just plain 'No'", "Author": "K. Biegler", "ReviewID": "R30C738A5TKIC5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buying a TV used to be more straight forwarded. First off this was to replace a bedroom TV which died in only 3-4 years (see magnavox review) so what was Not expected was a super top of the line HDTV picture. Not only were our expectations low but so, unfortunately, were our results. TV was hooked up to satellite feed and DVD in BOTH circumstances the picture quality was simply unacceptable (signal was checked with an older CRT TV/VCR combo and that picture was just right). No matter how over the course of a couple of days the picture settings were customized it was virtually impossible to achieve a setting that gave even close to realistic colors, tones and contrast. For example ... the blacks were an obvious 'green' the color was either a ghastly vibrant or muted to the point of being B&W.; Perhaps it was a bad set since I haven't really seen any reviews but for my first attempt at buying a LED HDTV it simply didn't work out.
