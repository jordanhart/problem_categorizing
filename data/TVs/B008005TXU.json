{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for the Price", "Author": "tsamneb", "ReviewID": "R2PUDVUOB97RLL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV on sale from Amazon after extensive research. Said extensive research turned up virtually nothing. I couldn't find much information, reviews, anything on the TV, which made me really hesitant to complete the purchase. Pretty much everything I did find was positive, though, and it was discounted close to 50%, so I couldn't pass it up. Having the TV for about a month now, I'd say that I'm satisfied with my purchase. I'm about at the lower end of the intermediate level as far as technological literacy, so this review is for those who don't care about the innards and just want to know how well it operates.Appearance:The device itself looks super slick. It's very slim and sleek. The ports are all located on the back, but easily accessible. It has large, clearly visible, yet not obnoxious, operation buttons. It looks great sitting on the shelf.Sound:The sound is pretty awful. I purchased it not concerned about the sound because I have a pretty sweet sound system, but the receiver is old and I can't connect it. So that's my fault. There are two options for sound (don't really know the difference in terms of how they produce it), and you can adjust the EQ, so if you fiddle with it a little, you can get it to sound satisfactory. The audio is delayed a bit when you turn it on, but not a big deal. Just that I notice myself reaching to turn it up when I first turn it on, then on it kicks and I have to turn it back down. Less of a complaint, more of just a quirk.Picture:Good, not great. If you want a full-blown theatre experience, you'll be disappointed. If you want to just enjoy a movie with some friends, you'll be fine. It does colors really well, very bright and vivid, but it doesn't do darks too well. They end up a little muddy, flat. It's got a bit of a cloudy/grainy overlay on everything. Sports are great on it though; football and basketball games look pretty sweet on it. So if you want a gameday TV, this is a good one. Just a note on some of the lackluster picture issues, they may come from the fact that I'm currently running the cable stuff through a coaxial cable, not HDMI. I dunno too much about how it works, but just keep that in mind in case you're better aware of the effect that may have than I am. BlueRays look great.Miscellaneous:It's got a sufficient amount of ports. I'm not a gamer or anything, so the 2 HDMI ports are plenty. I had at one point read that someone was frustrated by it having 720 as its default resolution or something, but I haven't experienced that at all; if 1080 is available, it displays that. It's Energy Star certified, which is important to me, low energy consumption.Overall, I'm satisfied with it. I didn't have $1000 to spend on a TV, so I didn't end up with a $1000 quality TV, but it's sufficient. There are lots of other TV's out there that have a better picture quality than this one, but it's totally acceptable for the budget I had. Happy I bought it, satisfied with what it offers, overall a good purchase. Hope that helps.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Product not as Advertised", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "R1KJV0R0QCI1D6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of digging about this television before the purchase, and I have to say, the information and reviews about the television are almost nonexistent. The few reviews I managed to find were all good ones, so I decided to go ahead and purchase the television (Haier LE39F2280 39-Inch 1080p).It arrived quickly, and with no damage to the television itself, although the packaging box looked like Mike Tyson and Wolverine had a vendetta against it. The product inside the box doesn't actually have 3 HDMI ports as advertised. It has 2, which is a problem for me since I chose this television over another for the simple fact that I needed the extra HDMI port to connect all my devices without the hassle of having to swap out connections or have RGB wires everywhere. Also, the native resolution for this television is 720p, so every time you try and connect a new device to it, it wants to default to 720.The TV menu is overly simplistic, with my main concern being the fact that there is absolutely no way to turn off the overscan. (The video on televisions is actually zoomed in a bit on default. Most devices account for this, but there are some instances where you have to turn the zoom off manually on the television to keep from having the edges clipped off of your video. This is usually done by simply changing the format/aspect ratio, or finding the overscan option in the TV menu and disabling it.) I have my PC connected to the TV, for gaming and video watching reasons, but the video is clipped at the edges. The only way I could find to get around this involved tweaking a few settings on my PC's video card which also forced me to lower the video quality to a custom resolution a bit lower than 1920x1080, so I'm not exactly happy with the fix. There is an option in the menus to \"update software\", which I'm assuming would update the TV menu...if any update software actually existed. I checked everywhere and turned up nothing. I'll be checking with tech support soon to see if they have any beta software or another option to fix this problem.Other than that, the TV is fine. The picture is great for the price. The ports all function properly. The standby light isn't bright. I would have rated this television much much better if I had access to the information I'm giving now.", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent tv for price", "Author": "drrayl", "ReviewID": "R2313ZUWYL4ICV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Picture quality isn't bad, though there aren't many options for adjusting your picture.I was having issues with sound on the TV, where you could hear humming constantly from the rear.From reading reviews, I expected to  never hear back from the Haier Customer service, but they just sent me another TV today!I still hear a little humming, but it's no where near as bad, and now not noticeable.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware if service is needed", "Author": "BP in FL", "ReviewID": "RBZ1GVLDN5YZB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this 5 months ago, Good Picture, great Sound.

It has been a month and a half and I'm still waiting for the replacement. I have gotten calls from Haier to tell me that the shipping information has not been updated in their system.

When you turn the TV ON there is an extremely noticeable 6-7 second delay before the sound comes on. To be honest, if your TV is on all day, obviously, this wouldn't affect you much.  But since this is in a secondary bedroom for me and rarely used, every time I turn it on, I stop in my tracks and turn around to turn it on again, only realizing then that it is on, I just have to wait the 6 or 7 seconds for the audio to come on.Anyway, overall, a really good TV.  Since I paid so little for it, I consider it \"disposable\".  In other words, if it lasts me two or three years before it dies, I'll feel that I got more than my money's worth.That said, since Haier is a rather off brand and I bought the TV so cheap, I did throw in another $25 and got the 3-year Square Trade Warranty.  I wouldn't buy a TV this small for the living rooom (we have a 70\" out there) but it makes a terrific secondary bedroom TV.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broke in 10 months- Warranty a hassle... 3 months fighting for my money back...", "Author": "Michael Mcdonald", "ReviewID": "R290QXDMG1DFAW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought a HAIER TV in 2011- and the the component input never worked. Lived with that for a while then decided to use the \"Warranty\" (Warranty is Chinese for \"Yeah right-- sucker!!!\") Sept. 2012.The repair center (repair center is Chinese for \"fake storefront that is never open\") was closed when I tried to take the TV in during business hours. They told me they would come pick up the tv twice and neglected to at all over 5 weeks (We haven't had anyone in that neighbourhood they said...). I had to re-register my repair twice and still no show. So I called Haier again who arranged for a replacement. 3 weeks later I'm told that they are out of that TV and I can wait till they make some new ones or, just get a full refund. I opted for the refund because in the meantime, this TV completely quit working.It is now January 16th and no sign of a cheque. I've been told 3 times that it will be there soon- they only cut checks once / month so it can take up to 35 days to receive it. They have had to re-order the check to be cut twice because of \"oversight\".This product is Garbage and their warranty is useless.It is not worth it to try it out- Google HAIER WARRANTY issues and see that it is their company policy to lie, deceive and attempt to wear down their customers legitimate warranty claims in order to avoid the responsibility (a word which has no equivalent modern chinese translation, apparantly...)", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't Waste Your TIme or Money", "Author": "Not made in the USA", "ReviewID": "RP4QL1RRPDGWM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had received a Haier TV last Christmas; it was purchased in December but, I did not have it hooked up until March. It worked for one & half day! Long story short - I started calling Haier America right away, which was located in Pennsylvania, everyone was very nice & spoke English. I followed all directions and was always promised a new TV would be sent in 7-10 business days - nothing,- no TV, no call back, no email from Haier and I called every month, sometimes followed-up twice a month; then in June, when calling I would get a representative in the Phillipines! Always with an American name and always with the same reply!Solution: after 8 months of no one ever returning my calls, not having a TV because that was my only one, paid cable bill for 8 months with no TV to service, decided I would sue them in small claims court! I gave it one last call and I finally got to speak to someone in the NY office, only when I asked for an address to serve a subpeona; settled for a low amount, can't even purchase their cheapest TV, which I would NOT do anyway! Finally received the check after 8 months ;money & time was certainly lost from this company!Summary: it is not Haier America, the service reps are overseas, their products are worthless, horrible service, and all written correspondense is done thru a NJ post office box. Don't even waste your time thinking about purchasing their produces, you'll see if you have to deal with them.Also, shop around to other places, I was very disappointed with Amazon, they only have a return policy of 30 days from purchase, even if its a gift, wouldn't do anything to assist me; other places have 60 or 90 days.

Haier LE32D32200 32-Inch 720p 60Hz LED HDTV -I purchased a 32 inch TV for my mom and brother for Christmas (2012).  I bought the 32 inch white model with all of the internet apps.  My family was ecstatic when they got it and loved watching Netflix on the TV. about a month later, the TV just quit working.  My brother has been going back and forth with Haier ever since trying to get the TV fixed or replaced.  He drove 90 miles (RT) to the nearest warranty center and they were closed when he got there, even though he made an appointment.  They said they were training that day.  Next the repairman was supposed to come out but never got there.  finally they said the part was no longer available and that they would send a new TV to replace the broken one.  They stated that the TV we had was no longer available, but they would send an updated model that had everything the old TV had and more.  My brother just got the TV last week (end of June 2013) 5 months after the original broke down.  The one they sent is black not white, has less HDMI inputs, no internet connectivity, meaning no more Netflix.  When he called, they stated that he signed a waiver stating that he would accept the model that he sent and that he approved it by looking at it on the internet.  When he did try to look at the model on the internet, it was not available to look at it.  He told customer service this and they could not find it either, but assured him that this TV was so new it wasn't on the website yet, but would be better than the one that I had purchased for them.
