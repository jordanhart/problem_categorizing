{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfectly decent 720p TV", "Author": "alltheusernamesaretaken", "ReviewID": "R2UETA75MR1QQ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After requesting this product for an Amazon Vine review, I read the other existing reviews, most of which were ambivalent or even negative. I was scared that the TV was going to turn out a piece of junk.Well, after using it for a month, I'm pleased to report that I was mostly happy with it. I don't think it quite deserved the harsh reviews and will offer a contrarily positive one.Color:========================Maybe I just got lucky with a different batch, maybe our settings were different, or maybe I'm just not as sensitive as the other reviewer when it comes to colors, but they looked absolutely fine to me. I'm an amateur graphic designer and photographer, and while I wasn't able to afford a colorimeter to quantitatively test the TV's color quality, the colors looked just fine to my naked eye through its month of use, even compared to two highly-rated IPS monitors and the Nexus 10 tablet, all of which I bought for their display quality. With my Nexus tablet connected to the TV in mirror mode, I adjusted the TV's display settings and got about a 90% match in color, more than fine enough for movies, picture slideshows, etc.Other display qualities:========================The contrast and saturation were set a bit strong and the brightness/backlight a bit weak when I got it, but a little bit of fiddling got it looking better. The factory default settings didn't look \"bad\", per se, just overemphasized for \"pop\" (I prefer a more neutral look). It may not be immediately clear, but the TV offers different viewing modes such as EnergyStar, Cinema, Game, etc., but also advanced settings and a User mode that lets you tailor everything more specifically (if you're so inclined). Again, the picture from the factory was OK to begin with and in fact people who use this primarily for movies might even prefer the exaggerated color and contrast.The backlight was bright and even, and the viewing angles were great, not mediocre -- I could walk from all the way to its left to all the way to its right and still see everything fine. No real-world situation is going to have the couches spread that far to its sides, anyway.Overall I rather like the picture quality of this TV. The glossy coat makes the colors pop even more and isn't too distracting. With the backlight on high enough, it's even possible to watch this near a window in full sun.Screen size:========================Definitely a 32\". Its viewable area was 31.75\", so it doesn't get any bigger than that without jumping into another size class altogether. Perhaps the other reviewer measured horizontally instead of diagonally? Not really sure what happened there, but my unit was every bit as big as it ought to be.Tuner/Inputs:========================Admittedly I didn't get to try this, but I did try the TV with a Roku, a computer, and a Nexus 10 tablet (all via HDMI). All looked fine and the TV also handled downscaling from 1080p well.Audio:========================It is unfortunate, as another reviewer remarked, that there is no audio out. This can be annoying if you have a home audio system you want to hook it up to (or even just listen with headphones late at night), but the sound from the TV itself was fine to my ears. Nothing spectacular, but nothing obviously missing either.Miscellaneous:========================The remote is ergonomic and well-designed. The on-unit controls, however, were hidden behind the screen and not easy to access. The stand is steady but non-adjustable.Value:========================It seems in line, price-wise, with the other 720p 32\" TVs. I'm disappointed that it didn't have internet connectivity, but it seems that other TVs in its price class don't either. The one thing that did bug me quite a bit was the 720p. For maybe $60 more, you can get 40% more resolution with a 1080p display, which makes text sharper and little details in movies more visible.Conclusion:========================I feel compelled to give the TV 4/5 because it does everything it needs to do, but it doesn't stand out in any particular way. In my opinion, for something as commoditized as TVs, you have to REALLY stand out to get a 5/5. But I certainly feel that this model does its job just fine, and that I wouldn't regret it if I paid full price for it (note: Vine reviewers do not pay for their reviewed products).", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just ok. Over-saturated greens and yellows.", "Author": "Extravaganttraveler", "ReviewID": "R1BFHGS45CI0FN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got this at Best Buy. The price was right and at the time it looked great. When I got it home it was very easy to set up. After watching it for a while I noticed the greens and yellows are very inaccurate and over saturated. They look almost fluorescent at times. I hooked up an Apple TV and compared some photos I took in the jungles of Costa Rica and all the greens looked waaay too bright. NO AMOUNT OF MESSING WITH THE SETTINGS SEEMED TO HELP THIS ISSUE. I was even able to access the hidden menu but STILL UNABLE to adjust individual colors in the spectrum. If not for the bad color I would have been totally happy with this TV. I even went BACK to Best Buy to see if their floor model looked the same and INDEED IT DID. Apparently they are all like this. I tried and tried to adjust myself to the bad color but no matter how I tried I just couldn't accept it. I returned the unit to Best Buy on the 14th day.PROS:- Nice design. Light, thin, very slim bezel.- Nice wide viewing angleCONS:- Bad color. Especially Greens and Yellows are overly bright. Adjusting settings does not really help. Not enough control in settings.- Only digital out for audio. If I want additional speakers I will need to purchase a speaker system with digital input. Call me old fashioned but I like a standard audio out (either 1/8 headphone jack or stereo RCA's).- Only 2 HDMI inputs. 3 would be nice.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for Kids or Guest Room", "Author": "A.

set up was very easy. The only tools needed for this was a Phillip screwdriver to connect the stand. There were 5 simple steps once set up and the picture came in very clearly although a little green.  I must admit that I haven't played around with all the settings but from what I saw it looked pretty good with it not even being hooked up to a Cable or SAT box. The sound is also pretty good as you can hear.This comes with 2 HDMI and 1 Component output. Remote is small but has big buttons and very easy to use.It does look a little smaller than 32\" though but it does state 32 on the box. This is a great TV for your kids rooms or even a guest room.I've uploaded pics of the back of the TV and remote since the manufacturer didn't.

Not the TV for serious movie or sports watching, or picky viewers.  I have been watching/evaluating this TV right next to my 32\" Vizio TV.  They are both LED, 720p & 60Hz.  I think the picture is better on the Vizio & the sound is much better on the Vizio.  I also own a Panasonic 50\" Plasma that of course blows both of these TVs out of the water but that is not a fair comparison.  That is the TV I use for movies, sports, etc.-The blacks are OK for an LED TV with no \"scanning or blinking\" backlighting.  You get what you pay for here.-The colors are OK even when watching at the factory setting.  Again, no \"scanning or blinking\" backlighting causes the colors to not \"pop\" as well & may appear \"off\" color.  You may want to adjust.-Watching fast moving sports/action is not great on this TV; again because of the constant backlight (no \"scanning or blinking\").  There is a bit of blur.-Viewing Angle:  The viewing angle on this TV is pretty good; most LED TVs struggle with viewing angle.  Part of the reason the viewing angle \"looks\" better on this TV is that it is not such a perfect picture to begin with so you don't notice a big degradation in picture when you move to the side.  If you have a small room & don't intend to watch this TV from the side, this will probably not be a deal breaker for you.  I always take the manufacturer's viewing angle claims with a heavy dose of skepticism.  You should place this TV on level with your eyes; not too high or low.  I have mine on a table that is the right height for viewing in bed.  In my case, the center of the TV screen is at approximately 37\" from the floor.-The base is small so good for small tabletop (11\" x 7-1/8\").-Not a \"smart\" TV so no built-in Wi-Fi.-EPG (Electronic Program Guide) only shows what is currently on TV; not upcoming programming.- Probably not good for using as a computer monitor because it has low resolution & at this size it will be very noticeable.-The remote is pretty simple and straight forward.  I had my elderly mother try it and she had no problems other than needing a tutorial on how to use the menu to change colors, etc.  So this TV will go in a guest bedroom; simple to use & a decent picture.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Panasonic always meets my expectations", "Author": "Walde Orellana", "ReviewID": "R2B55BI5PYYZ60", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic is my brand of choice, first of all no need for insurance plans when I dispose of a Panasonic equipment is because is obsolete, never because of malfunction or technical problems.This product in particular is also a good option for the price, considering LED technology is recent", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceptional TV", "Author": "Sally Spainhower", "ReviewID": "R2K6778IWKEDVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to get rid of my 15 year-old Sony TV, and I've had really good luck with my Panasonic DVD and video recorder, so I decided to get this TV.

I didn't see a picture blur, but I am not a full blown techie.I hooked mine up to my digital antenna & it was a breeze to set up - the TV recognized all of the available channels without a hiccup.  The remote is on the medium to smallish side, but it is responsive to the touch.  The remote comes with batteries.The sound is decent & does project.  It is not as booming as my old Vizio, but the sound is better than a Westinghouse that we sampled last year.  Even with running on a treadmill, I did not have to turn the volume all the way up.Viewing angle is decent - about what you would expect from a 32\" budget TV.All in all, for the price, the TV delivers.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "good picture", "Author": "Larry J Minor", "ReviewID": "R3VHD7J9LAU1VA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPSDelivered two doors down from my house, If I had not known my neighbors, I probably would not have a TV.UPS needs to get drivers that can read", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$379.00", "Features": "60 Hz\n720P\nMedia Player\nTV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 29.2 X 17.8 X 3.08 Inches, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 29.2 X 20.3 X 7.3 Inches", "Name": "Panasonic TC-L32B6 32-Inch 720p 60Hz D-LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-bmoKRnAL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B2H74EU"}}
