{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Philip H. Rand \"Phil\"", "ReviewID": "R2CYUAVFQYATEI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My sister bought one of these for use in Yakima, WA.Pro:1) Nice picture, especially HD.  Yakima has HD broadcast channels I didn't know about, and they look great.2) Audio better than I expected with a small TV like this.  My dad is hard of hearing, but I was able to boost the treble and roll off the bass via the menu, and he can hear much better than with the old set.3) Reception good on digital channels.  Rabbit ears antenna from old tv works fine, though this house has really good reception, so you may need a better antenna if you are in a poor reception area.Cons:1) Remote control gets the job done, but it's a little hard to find the mute button for commercials.  The on-set controls would be a pain to use, like most tvs, so don't lose the remote.2) A 22 inch diagonal wide-screen tv is really pretty small -- especially when displaying a 4:3 program.  Ideal viewing distance is probably around 6 to 8 feet or less.3) Reception and picture poor on the old analog channels, but they are going away next month, so who cares?Caveat:  Shop around -- we got this set at Costco for about [...] less than the price I see at Amazon, though the picture at Amazon shows a wider base than the one we have.  I double-checked the model, VO22L, but maybe there is some mixup?", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "No regrets in buying this", "Author": "Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"", "ReviewID": "R3TS6SYR4V0OXI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "CONSPIRACY!  Are all HDTV's required to have crappy, tinny sound like a full-treble, no-bass radio to get consumers to buy surround sound systems for it?  Probably.I bought this TV in particular because aside from the low price which impressed me very much, it had a deal-breaker for me; speedy remote control.Despite the vast advances in technology these days, TV technology seems to be backtracking, as a 10 year old Philips Magnavox POS TV I've had for ten years has superior quality sound to this TV, and has a faster-responding remote to most TV's these days.I could not handle a TV that takes 3-5 seconds just loading every damn channel, and so I picked this one because the response time is often times only 1 second maximum.  So the biggest value here comes in fast remote respond time.It is indeed HD and it's small with a large screen, so considering the price it is, it's a good value.My only complaints aside from the sound is that it appears to have some difficulty regarding some widescreening and HD compatibility:- There are only two widescreen options: fullscreen and widescreen (or panoramic, which does almost nothing).  As such, it seems completely incapable of adjusting itself for watching a widescreen DVD by zooming the picture in on top of the black bars, and you can either watch the image stretched out needlessly with gigantic black bars on top or bottom, or watch a super small image with FOUR black bars---two on the sides as well.I hope this was just an issue with my DVD player and not something that affects all DVD players with pan n scan abilities.  It didn't have this problem when watching a DVD on my Xbox360.- There's only one row of HD compatible wires.  Anyone who knows how to plug in an HD device into the TV knows that aside from SD's yellow-white-red wire configuration, the HD equivalent has green-red-blue added on to the white and red for audio.  This TV only has one row of them for use, so I can only have one HD device plugged into the TV at one time.  This isn't a big deal.", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV but the rest is lacking", "Author": "Deanna", "ReviewID": "RJBZY6X5T6E63", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the picture quality and reception with this TV.  I only have a basic rabbit ear antenna on it and the HD channels are great.  It was easy to set up.  There are a few cons 1) the stand is very short. 2) The remote is poor.  The sleep timer function is buried in the menu.  The shape and feel are boxy and uncomfortable.If you are wall mounting and using a \"universal\" remote, you will love this little TV.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "great picture, but is terrible for watching movies", "Author": "Peace B. Lovejoy", "ReviewID": "R1Y3M72OZF7E93", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This has a great picture, but has some annoying problems.  First of all, if you connect it directly to a coaxial cable wire, you cannot channel surf.  The channel up and down will not work on the remote or the TV.  You must enter the channel from the remote numeric keyboard.  This might not seem as annoying as it really is.  Also, it connects as a component with the three RCA jacks when connected to a VCR or cable box, not through the coaxial cable from the VCR or box, so be sure to use the manual when you set it up.  Those two seem to be easily overcome, but the wide angle problem described by the other reviewer totally stinks!!!  Whenever you watch movies from On Demand or whatever, the black bars drive you crazy.  What is up with that!!!  You get slight black bars on other TVs but this is extreme and does not seem to be able to be remedied.  You get 3 choices.  With Wide you get large black bars.  With Panoramic, you do a little better, but not much.  With Normal, it is absolutely ridiculous, because you get a little tiny picture in the middle of the screen, with no way of enlarging it that I can tell. It's like watching a 10\" screen.  If you are using this as a computer monitor, it's great; but if you are using it as a TV and you plan on watching movies, and/or if you plan to hook it up directly to cable with a coaxial cable, buy something else!!!", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great image although not very loud", "Author": "M. Marshall", "ReviewID": "R1F8V9SWAPQM1E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use my 22\" Vizio just for watching DVDs, since I don't get any free t.v. reception or pay for any.  I'm glad I bought it. The image is great!  The 22\" size works fine for me or for me and a friend; for more viewers of course bigger would be better, but this one is small enough to put away in a nook of my bedroom when not needed in the living room, and is nice and light weight for moving.Don't worry about the extra black bars reported by a couple of the viewers; I had that until I went into my DVD player's setup and told it I now had a 16:9 t.v.The only reason I don't give this five stars is that it doesn't get very loud.  I seem to play most movies with the volume set at around 75% most of the time, and there have been several movies that I've played most of at 100% volume.  I'm usually watching alone in a fairly quiet apartment with only the buzz of a space heater 6 feet away to overcome, and I sit just a few feet from the t.v.  So this doesn't bode well for anyone hard of hearing or living in a noisier household.  I suppose you would fix it by attaching external speakers purchased separately.Incidentally I bought it February '09 at Sam's Club for 298.00 plus tax.", "Date": "March 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV, very happy", "Author": "C. Banks \"clb\"", "ReviewID": "R5SZXD8UZNK26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with this TV. I bought a Sharp 19 inch a few weeks back and had to return it because I could not get rid of the orange people. Yes, I read the manual and went through all of the menus but I couldn't figure out how to make it look better. Sharp tech support took two weeks to get back to me. I returned it and found this one, it was a great picture right out of the box. Also, unlike some of the smaller TVs that people often complain about, the sound is fine.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price!", "Author": "Allygator \"Ally\"", "ReviewID": "R1LQIDCLO6MIOO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very impressed with the quality of this TV for such a low price.  I needed a small set for my office and 22\" is the ideal size for my viewing distance and available space.  This Vizio is perfect for my needs. The quality of the HD picture is crisp and clear, the color full and rich, the blacks deep and true.The only slight negatives are the sound is a little tinny, but that seems to be common to all flat screen TV's, and the remote control isn't very intuitive.  But these are very small complaints.  I've already gotten used to the sound and it's just a matter of learning the remote.I have a large Sony Bravia in my family room with the full surround sound set up, so I go there if I want to watch a movie.  But for watching TV while I work at my computer, it's ideal. Very impressive little TV, much more than I expected for such a low price.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love this TV!", "Author": "K.

Tech support was no help. So I returned it and bought this.I never thought there would be so much difference in picture quality but because I had viewed them so close together, the difference was very noticeable.The VIZIO has a very clear, colorful picture. In high def it is amazing.We have two of them this size and they have both worked great for over 1 year. We also have a VIZIO 46\" as our main tv. It is also terrific and has done well for over two years.It comes with all the ports that I need for adding components and HDMI.I don't think you can go wrong with VIZIO. They are quality at a great price.", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good and bad", "Author": "C.

Thoms", "ReviewID": "RRVCJBM91T9AQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a small, inexpensive TV for the bedroom, and this one turned out to be perfect in most ways.  The picture is great and the sound is fine for the way I use it--I have not connected a DVD player to it yet, so I can't speak to the problems some people have experienced.I agree with other reviewers that the weakest part is the onscreeen menu using the remote.  It is simply too small to see it without getting real close to the set.  Given the fact that it's in the bedroom, and I use it a lot to set the sleep timer, that is a real negative. I also agree that the \"normal\" \"wide\" and \"panoramic\" settings for altering the proportions of the picture are inadequate. Then again, for a secondary set, the price is right, and the quality of the picture is just fine.I should add that I also bought this at Costco about a month ago and it was only $269 plus tax.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good one but for the sound", "Author": "Guru \"Guru\"", "ReviewID": "R1CD4GRJOIYHJH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV is a good one for the money. I bought this one at the sams club for 268 dollars which was cheaper than Amazon. There are only 2 HDMI ports. Would be nice if it had atleast 3. Picture quality was good but the sound quality was not so good. I've to attach external speakers to have a lively sound. The power consumption was only 40 watts and it is a plus point.

I've had no problems with it whatsoever.  The picture quality is great, the sound quality is great, the TV itself looks good and it's easy to assemble and put most anywhere.At the beginning of the year my little standard-def TV finally blew up after many years of use, and that, coupled with the fact that I didn't want to have to watch the final season of Lost on that piece of junk, started me on my quest for a suitable replacement.  I almost always watch TV at my workstation where the only place for a television to go is about 2 or 3 feet away from where I sit, so I needed something that wasn't too huge but was also top quality and relatively inexpensive, and this television ended up being really the only one that met all three of those requirements.Funnily enough I actually paid more for my mini standard-def TV originally (it was flat screen which was a big deal back when I first bought it) than I did for this HDTV, and the standard-def television was half the size.  A great investment and a great television.

Its perfect for a bedrooms, dorm rooms but a little large for a kitchen. I have had no problems with it. It has great sound and picture quality for analog and HD channels. I do suggest investing in a blu-ray player because dvds will be letter boxed with bars around the picture when played on a DVD player but are upconverted and look great on a blu-ray player. personally i got this Sylvania NB501SL9 1080p Blu-Ray Disc Playerwhich is inexpensive and works beautifully.I also sometimes hook it up to my PC using a VGA cable to play movies from my hard drive or dvds which also looks great and can then be played in widescreen however i need external speakers for good sound to play from my computer.Overall this is a lovely addition to my electronics collection.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Size: 22-inch (21.6-inch viewable)\n16:9 Aspect Ratio\nAnti-static and hard coated surface\nPixel/Dot Pitch: 0.248 mm\n5 ms response time", "Name": "Vizio VW22L VW22LHDTV10T 22 inch LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KyOU-c%2BFL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001T776TG"}}
