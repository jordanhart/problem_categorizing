{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy set up, good price, needs more robust remote", "Author": "Charles L. Vogel \"Larry\"", "ReviewID": "RON0ER3C0TZVH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this last week. I was impressed with the price considering the features, specifically the built-in apps and wireless connectivity. Set up was a breeze. I had it up and running within 30 minutes. Fantastic picture, good sound, a big step up from my 5 year old Sony Bravia. It's close to my router, so I wired it in and am not using the wireless, so I can't comment on that. There's only two downsides, and these are minor. One is the remote. A qwerty keyboard would have been nice, but as it it you need to navigate through an onscreen keyboard with directional keys. This is big issue during setup...getting in passwords for Netflix, etc...but I don't imagine it will be a big deal for everyday use. Another is that the out-of-the-box built-in apps don't include Pandora. To get it, I had to sign up for a Yahoo account (yeah, I'm probably one of the last people in the world without a Yahoo account), then sign up for their app library, and download the app to the TV from there. Again, kind of a pain and not particularly intuitive, but once set up is done, it's no longer an issue. So thanks, Vizio for a great product, but give us a more robust remote and include Pandora in the built-in apps and you'll get 5 stars.Added three weeks later: OK, now I've lived with this TV for a while. I've also learned two reasons why Vizio was able to reach such a low price point with it: 1) the backlight is fluorescent (CCFL) rather than LED, 2) the limited feature remote. I learned this after visiting Costco and seeing another Vizio model (M470SL) that at first glance looks identical to this product but is priced $120 higher. They were side-by-side, and try as I might I could see no difference in picture quality...both were excellent to my eye.  Upon closer inspection, I found the only differences to be the backlight (LED rather than CCFL) and a full-featured remote (I couldn't get the remote out of the box, but it appears to have a qwerty keyboard, which would be great for someone who uses the TV to access internet apps like Facebook, etc). The LED model is thinner and probably more modern-looking to some. If you're really interested, google \"ccfl vs led tv\" and learn how much of this is marketing hype and how much makes a meaningful difference to the end user (that would be you).I also noted that the reviewers at CNET complained that this model (E472VLE) does not render blacks very well, and rated it low for picture quality. I don't know what they were looking at, but the picture looks great to me. Comparing side-by-side in the store with more expensive models from other manufacturers, I could see no appreciable difference.  And as noted above, it appears identical to the Vizio M470SL (to my eyes), that CNET seems to like better. The specs actually show a brighter picture (measured in nits, whatever they are) for the CCFL model.I don't use the TV for internet work...I use my computer for that...so I'm fine with a less robust remote. The only time it bothered me was during setup when I had to enter a bunch of passwords. Fluorescent backlight means it will use a few bucks more worth of electricity per year (at my utility's rates it's about $6 per year), but picture quality (to me) is indistinguishable from the more expensive LED backlight. I've also read some other reviews where customers have complained that the LED backlight failed after a few months. So for me, I'm sticking with the model I have.", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good budget HDTV (update)", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "RV06UZP6D25OC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a week with this TV, I've decided that I'm glad that I resisted the urge to buy a more state-of-the-art, and more expensive, model. This meets all of my needs, plus adds some nice to have features that I didn't think I would get for this price.The most important thing, of course, is the picture. I am very pleased with it. For example, I watched the OTA broadcast of the first game of the NBA finals, and the picture was as good as anything I've seen with the demo loops they show at the stores. Also, I'm pleasantly surprised that OTA SD content looks good, too. I've seen some other TVs at friends houses that do a poor job on SD content. It also does well with DVDs, and other non-HD content, such as things I have encoded over the years.The picture is incredibly sharp and detailed with an Xbox 360. If there are any image blurring issues in games, they are beyond my eyesight.This TV also has a very good viewing angle. I don't notice much of a drop-off of image quality, even when sitting almost completely to the side of the screen.The speakers are another plus. Not spectacular, but plenty loud enough to fill the room, and of good fidelity.Another reviewer criticised the remote. I agree with that. It is of the \"lots of tiny buttons\" category, and not as responsive as I would like. But after programming the TiVo remote for the TV, I rarely use it, anyway.The various setup/tweaking menus could have been done better. For one thing, I don't understand why, on a 1080p-capable screen, the text of some items is almost unreadable. Thankfully, there's not much setup to be done, and for the most part, I'm too lazy to be a tweaker.The Internet connectivity and apps features are a mixed bag. The Netflix app is at least as good as what I have on a Roku box, and I will definitely use it; but the YouTube app , and some others I have tried are pretty useless.Update 20130224: I still don't regret buying this TV. This was my first large-screen HDTV,  and it is a very good starter set. However, when and if I buy another large-screen set, I am going to pay more attention to how the picture looks in situations like at night with lamps on in the room where you are viewing. I am not a videophile, so I don't know whether that is related to \"black-level\" or what, but I know I will seek a set that does a better job of it than this set does.Here's the deal: Prior to this set, my \"HDTV\" was a DLP projector that was capable of 1080i. This worked pretty well, but it really had to be viewed in a darkened room. I liked the big picture I got, but I didn't really like sitting in a dark room to watch TV. Consequently, I ended up using the projector almost exclusively for movies, and continued watching TV shows on my old 35'\" Sony analog CRT.When I first got the Vizio, I thought this was going to be the best of both worlds. A larger image, and HD resolution that could be watched in a normally lighted room. As far as for watching broadcasts during daylight hours, I was right. The projector was almost unviewable in a daylight-lit room, but the Vizio is pretty good. However, in a room at night with a couple of lamps on, there are real problems with the Vizio.Especially with movies or TV shows where there are a lot of dark scenes. During these types of scenes, if you are sitting in certain parts of the room, the refection of the lamplight can almost completely wash out the picture. Consequently, while viewing those types of things, I end up turning all the lights out, like with the projector.Like I said, I'm not a videophile, so I don't intend to spend a fortune to eliminate this problem. But I know I will pay attention to this on the next set I buy.On the plus side, the Vizio apps have ended up being much more useful to me than I thought they would. In fact, I probably spend more hours viewing streams than I do on broadcast.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV.

All kinds of different modes for it. Game mode is a must for Video games, and it preforms well. It's Very lightweight. The Remote control can be a little at times...unresponsive and small as well, but no biggie. It has a lot of features and includes setups for the ports you have for instance: HDMI 1 can be labeled HDMI1/360 or HDMI2/Computer. That's great when you can name your inputs I think.Pros? Picture, setting features, lightweight, 4 HDMI ports, optical Toslink and RCA ports, and sleek design on a budget.Cons? Sound is quite a letdown but nab a LG Sound bar like I did and you'll have a better time with your TV.The stand is a little too flimsy wall mount would be a better choice if your wall isn't covered in Marvel posters like mine.All in all it's a great TV if you got a little money in the pocket.

Let me 1st tell you that amazon.com is great.  I ordered the TV intially on 6/13 and received it on 6/20.  I had to return it because of a manufacturer defect in the tv (there was a dark area in the upper right corner of the viewing screen like there were dead cells in the viewing screen). I immediately returned the TV the next day on 6/22 and to my surprise the replacement was at my door on 6/23.  I followed all the return instructions and amazon.com immediately took care of it.  There was also an issue with set up as I had to establish a more secure connection (per Vizio a WPA2 is what they recommend) so I had to deal with my ISP to get that done, but after that I still had to call Vizio to finish the process because my ISP didn't have me reset the router after changing my password.  After that was done, I could set up the TV.  The picture and sound quality is great, not to mention I got it at a great price ($650.00).  You won't be disappointed with this purchase.  Like the previous reviews, it would have been nice to have a keyboard set up when putting in all my passwords to Hulu Plus, Amazon & Netflix, but once there in you don't have to worry about that any longer.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Had to take it back", "Author": "james", "ReviewID": "RWVLFY3WNFIO7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this model 45 days ago.

Right off the bat, it took about 20 minutes to set up. Very simple and easy with precise on screen instructions. I am not an expert, but the picture appears to be excellent.  I listened to CNET reviewer who said the black color was not black enough.  You could have fooled me. My son has a blue ray player (Playstation) and we watched Planet Earth. I had to look at the specs to make sure this wasn't a 3D model.  The picture was perfect. The only minor complaint I might have is it seems to tilt a little forward (on the stand).  We were able to correct that somewhat by loosening the top screws and tightening the bottom ones, but it still appears to tilt.  Living in Earthquake country, that does concern me a little.

First day, the built-in Netflix VIA (Vizio Internet App) worked great.  But now the audio is out of sync.  The TV's Lip Sync setting can help, but the sync delay changes throughout each show, making the setting not work after a certain amount of time.  This is unacceptable.  It's extremely convenient having a Netflix button on the remote control, but if the app doesn't work, then it's no good.I've only played around with a couple other VIAs.  As another review said, the YouTube app is completely worthless.  Its navigation is awful -- there is no search functionality that I've found.  I'm considering getting a Boxee and being done with Vizio's apps.The picture is very good, though my previous set was a 27-inch Sony Trinitron, so anything looks good to me.  The sound is just so-so.  It's not at all unusable, but it's not great.Ultimately I may have to return this set if I can't get Netflix working correctly.** Update 02/21/2013 **I'm still having the Netflix audio sync problem, but it's a bit less severe now.  Most shows are OK by using a Lip Sync setting of 3.  Some shows are worse than others.  I had almost no problem with House of Cards, but Damages was bad; all over the place.

Youtube works well; search function is decent, can't seem to access an individual user channel or video playlist, which is a bummer.Biggest issue is Media Library / DLNA functions are very, very primitive.  Was able to get a couple videos to play off my home server but it wasn't seeing them all, and there are massive slowdowns and freezes when it tries to open my library folders (they are pretty big).  Worst is the UI for this function is pretty horrifying.  Text-based menus on a black screen almost MS-DOS like (not quite but look up a photo and you'll see.)Overall the functionality of this TV is, in theory, pretty amazing- we just need consistent software updates and firmware revisions to roll out from Vizio to support this product and make it all it can be.  Like I said, these are all software problems and as such can be easily fixed and improved with a little work from Vizio's engineers and a couple pushed updates.Remote is small and basic, a small negative.  Picture quality seems great to me but I'm not an expert as this is my first TV.  Have seen none of the audio sync / hard reset issues mentioned in other reviews (downloaded an update first day I used the TV, possible fixes were in there).edit: regarding the small remote, it's worth noting this TV will recognize a USB / wireless QWERTY keyboard and most (not all) of the apps and search boxes will support this.  makes searching SO much easier than toggling around the on-screen keyboards with the arrow direction keys (painful).edit 2: several months later, and I'm editing my review to knock it down to 2 stars.  my analog audio output is broken out of the box, and the interface issues listed above are very frustrating.  the 'Media Player' app, which should be one of the most used apps on a 'Smart TV', is basically useless, it plays barely any of my files.  there is nowhere i can find a list of supported video filetypes (doesn't play MKV, AVI..).  it refuses to see my shared network media library.  the app is buggy and crashes.  upon browsing a directory, you are presented with 'MUSIC / VIDEOS/ PHOTOS' (those aren't real folders), followed by a bunch of stuff like 'By Author' 'By Album'.. etc; none of these are actual folders on my drive.. i have my media library well organized, just let me browse my directories.. to actually get to see your folder list you have to go through 3 or 4 steps, and then it still doesn't show.. and if it does show it doesn't play... also i can't log into the Facebook app because the 'Email' form box has a character limit, and my facebook email is longer than fits in the box.  WTF.  The YouTube app barely works as well, searching is excruciatingly painful (the 'Backspace' button is mapped to 'Exit Menu'... try typing a search like that), and you can't view Channels or Playlists.  Also there's a main button on the remote called 'M-GO'.. which appears to be a big new flashy Vizio Product but currently takes you to a tiny window saying 'Coming Soon'... there is no clear way to check for Software Updates, if they are even available (i doubt it).  this is an unfinished, half assed product.  It does the basic functions of a TV, but the advanced stuff it claims to support (hello, we're paying more for a SmartTV), barely work if at all.
