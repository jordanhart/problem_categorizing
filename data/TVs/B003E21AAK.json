Gross", "ReviewID": "RM9V99FCIRRKO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "On the plus side -  Good picture; relative ease of operaton; OK (not spectacular) sound.On the negative side -  a major tuner issue.There is only one input marked cable/antenna.  With this TV, it is possible to search for and tune to EITHER cable signals or AIR signals but NOT both at the same time, even if they both come from the same box or signal input.  If you get cable and air channels through the same input, you have a problem.  Thus, if your signal includes both channels like 4.1, 5.1, etc. and channels like 7,8,9,10 there is no way to switch from one set to the other.  The only solution (per the company's own hotline) is to use a SECOND tuner and run one through cable/antenna and the other through HTMI or another input.  The second tuner can be a cable box, a DVR WITH its own tuner or something similar.We think this is a major feature weakness and have downgraded this TV to 4*.If you have the kind of TV signal that combines air and cable channels through one input and don't want to buy a second tuner, then we DO NOT recommend this set.Otherwise, it is fine.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "what a great TV", "Author": "LoganReddel", "ReviewID": "R2GZYK60XMYUJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is a very slick model made by sharp.  The all black trim gives the TV a clean look and makes the TV be able to mesh well in any room.  Watching HD channels on this 1080p model makes the things on TV look like they are right there in the room with you.  Also the 120Hz makes the connection extremely fast and is great for playing video games without an annoying lag.  If you are looking into buying a new TV, I would highly recommend this one.  It is not the newest TV, but the LCD is not going to be obsolete like the plasma due to the new LED, and because it is older you can get the TV for a significantly lower price.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Television", "Author": "MacPointMan", "ReviewID": "R39SQ6KRD1ED48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I install DirecTV service for a living.  I purchased this television after seeing and looking at MANY hi Def flat screen televisions.  I considered buying a LED Back-lit television but when I weighed the cost versus the products available I could not justify spending the extra money.  This television though a CCFL Back-lit rivals ANY and I mean ANY of the Brand new top of the line LED back-lit televisions.You can find this television for near or less than the $1000 price point at many different places.  this television produces amazingly clear and vibrant video.  Watching sports on this television is enjoyable to even the biggest sports fan and absolutely amazing.  I highly recommend this unit.  No one makes a Better LCD television than SHARP.
