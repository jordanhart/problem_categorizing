Anderson", "ReviewID": "RN79JY36SP9XJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was given this tv for my college dorm room. It's nothing special. It's not an extremely attractive looking television...looks a bit cheap. For some reason, when I try to get the picture to fullscreen, all sides are cut off. This is a problem when there are subtitles or, especially, when I am on the main menu of a DVD and I cannot see the Play, Special Features, Options, and Extras. My 19 in is already small, I don't want to have to select the smaller picture setting. Other than that...it's just ok. I had wished I would have gotten the old, larger screened, fat tv.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002BV2T9G"}}
