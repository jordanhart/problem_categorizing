{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Quality mount -- not cheap but low-cost (by design).  Like it.", "Author": "Young \"GoRedSox\"", "ReviewID": "R1LW8CC4OAHN1F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was skeptical of this mount.  Why should this be so cheap compared to other mounting kits?  I ordered one (due to the price), and prepared to return it if I did not think the mount could handle the weight of the 52\" LCD TV (Samsung).Once I got it, I understood the cost.  Good low-cost design and built with solid heavy duty steel.- Two horizontal bars are load-bearing, and for proper VESA spacing, they have to be parallel and relative distance must be in the right tolerances.  These are made of solid steel.- Two vertical bars (in the wall mount) are flimsey, and that's ok.  it should be solid enough make a rectangle box w/ square angles.  That's it.- Two vertical mounting (to the TV) brackets are of heavy duty metal.  Making this in to two parts (not one), reduction of material, but also allows free horizontal adjustment on the TV mount.- By doing the above, the kit is small, uses less metal (and reduce shipping and material waste).Positives---------1. Good solid and heavy duty construction.2. Good value (low-cost).  Paid less than $ 25 including shipping.3. Easy install.  Took 15 min to figure out the instruction (which is not totally clear), and 10~15 min to install and ready to watch.4. built-in level worked well during marking of mouting holes on the wall --I tested w/ my own, and was consistent.5. Once the mounted on the wall, and bracket on TV, you could adjust horizontal TV placement on the mount, just by sliding few inches left or right, post install.  I expect this to be safe and true if the wall mount is directly screwed into the wall studs.  I do not expect dry-wall install without the use of the studs to handle such adjustment.6. The brackets on TV could also be used to adjust vertical TV placement by a few inches up and down.  But for this one, you'll need to lift TV off the bracket and adjust and pull back :-).7. There is a reasonable space (I would say, just right) from the wall to the TV to get cables/connectors through WITHOUT using any expensive 90 degree connectors.  Plenty of space between two horizontal bars to put extra power outlet and data HDMI cable outlet to hide all the cables.8. This supports tilt up/down, and works well. Amazon product description does not make it clear.Negatives---------1. Just one.  Clearer instruction so that I do not need to spend 15 min figuring things out.  One could learn a lot form IKEA :-).2. Packing/Packaging -- Not necessarily Cheetah Mount issue -- mine came w/o missing parts, although I noticed torn cardboard box edges and some parts COULD have been lost during shipping.  Either double box, or have Cheetah use heavier box stock.Helpful Hints & Comments-------------------------1. DO NOT forget to tighten the screws (2) on the bottom horizontal bars AFTER TV is placed on the wall mount -- especially if you are in CA w/ quake.  This is what prevents TV falling off the mount accidentally.  But do not over-tighten (you are NOT securing from left-to-right movement).2. Very happy w/ my purchase.  Will get one more for my other TV.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "The more expensive wall mounts are overkill!", "Author": "Chaz D", "ReviewID": "R2NCT55JL172CC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I rarely write reviews, but I have been installing HDTVs for over 5 years and I am constantly getting questions from people asking which wall mount they should buy.  Without exception, I refer them to Amazon and Cheetah Mounts.  I've used over a dozen of these mounts for installations, and other than the built-in level being NOT trustworthy, this is a great mount and should work for just about any TV in the 32-65\" range. I have used this to mount anything from lighter LCD/LED displays to large heavier plasma TV's and it supports all of them just fine.  I have also used other expensive wall mounts in the past and so I can provide a comparative review.A lot of the reviews say the Cheetah mount looks cheap or flimsy.  In comparison to the more expensive mounts, I would agree with that observation.  However, when you understand the physics of what the wall mount is actually doing, you'll realize that a bulkier mount really isn't giving you much additional support in a fixed or tilt mount application.  That's because contrary to popular opinion, the wall mount isn't really carrying the entire weight of your TV - in fact, with the exception of articulating arm mounts, it's actually not even carrying a majority of it.  When the back bracket is installed across two studs (which is absolutely the way it should be done) and the bolts are firmly attached, the bracket, wallboard, and studs become tied together as one cohesive unit.  This allows maximum load transfer between the wall mount and the studs, which leaves the studs bearing most of the weight.  This concept applies the same whether you use a Cheetah mount or a more expensive mount.I am not saying that the more expensive mounts that use thicker gauge steel aren't stronger than the Cheetah Mount.  I would definitely wager that in a side-by-side test with increasing weights, the Cheetah Mount would probably fail before any of the other mounts I have worked with just based on the gauge of steel differences.  But, we're not talking about hanging your Ford Focus on the wall...we're talking about hanging a flat-panel TV and at the end of the day, the mount either holds your TV on the wall or it doesn't.  And, the Cheetah Mount does a fine job doing that.  This particular Cheetah mount is rated for 32\"-65\" TV's up to 165 lbs, and I cannot attest to the validity of that because you'll be hard-pressed to find any flat-panel display that comes even close to 165 lbs.  The heaviest TV I have ever mounted in the 32\" - 65\" range is a 65\" Panasonic plasma that weighed 100 lbs, and that is considered to be one of the heaviest TV's out there.  This mount handled that TV perfectly fine.A few pieces of advice regarding working with the Cheetah Mount:1) As mentioned, do not trust the level that is built into the bracket - I have had some that were OK and some that were way off.  The separate 6-inch level that is included is sufficient, but if you have a 2-ft or 4-ft level, you'll be most assured of being level.2) If you don't have a stud finder, invest in one (you can use the money you saved buying this bracket vs. a more expensive one).  If you have a stud finder, make sure the batteries are good.  The bolts used to attach the bracket to the wall are large, so you want to hit close to the center of the stud to get maximum hold.3) Connect the cables to the TV before hanging it.  You may have to have a 3rd person connect the cables just as you are raising the TV.  Once the TV is on the bracket, it will sit so close to the wall that it is almost impossible to maneuver cables around.Long story short, if you're skeptical trusting your $1,000+ investment to a $25 bracket, don't be. This thing will work just fine, and you'll be patting yourself on the back that you spent so much less on your wall mount than your friends!", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't beat it for the price!

Thomas", "ReviewID": "R1I7U5HF4G0L0I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just installed a 42\" Plasma in our bedroom, and here's my take:This is actually a surprisingly high-quality, sturdy mount. When I took it out of the box, I was pleasantly surprised.Be forewarned that the directions that come with this kit are mediocre at best. The pictures are vague, and only after wrangling with this pile of metal did I figure out how this thing is supposed to be assembled and installed. Please note that the mollies included in this kit are for MASONRY, not drywall. Probably obvious to most, but again the anemic instructions may lead you down a path of destruction. I may or may not have been led down said path... :-)So if you're using this in your home, here's what you need to do: 1. Assemble the rack on the floor/table/bed/whatever, and make sure it is square. 2. Find the wall studs, and mark them lightly with a pencil. 3. Hold the mount up on the wall where you want it, and the make sure the holes (not the \"obvious\" 4 holes) align with the stud marks. Adjust as necessary. 3. Level the mount horizontally, and drill pilot holes into the studs (make sure you are on-center!) and drill THROUGH the appropriate holes on the mount. 4. Use the included lag bolts to affix the assembled rack to the wall with an impact driver. 5. Attach the vertical bars to the TV, and then hook them on the installed rack. 6. Slide the mounted TV left/right, and tighten the clamps once the preferred angle is achieved. 7. Carefully screw the lower set screws into place (which hold the TV in place in the event that it gets bumped).I was just at <a commercial retailer> recently, and they have the EXACT same mount, under a different brand name, for $140.00. Had I purchased their product, I'm sure this review would be a tad more negatively biased.The bottom line: It works, it's sturdy, it's flexible. The instructions are lacking, which leads to frustration, but your average DYI person can pretty easily figure this out.Would I buy it again? Yes.

They used to be a 5 star product, but I'm re-reviewing this product and lowering it to 1 star after they have made several changes to the product in an obvious attempt to cut manufacturing and shipping costs.  After opening the package to hang my latest television, I discovered that the top and bottom rails are no longer 1 solid piece of steel.  They are now two pieces that need to be bolted together in the center by 12 screws, just so they can make the box smaller.  The steel itself is much thinner now and instead of a powder coat finish, they are using cheap spray paint.  There used to be a bubble level attached to the top bracket, in addition to a small torpedo level in the box.  The mounted bubble level is now gone, and the torpedo level has been replaced with a cheaper one too.  You used to be able to adjust the tilt of the mount using thumb levers.  Those thumb levers are now gone, and have been replaced with philips screws, so now you need to try to hold a screwdriver in the 3\" gap between the wall and the television.  Believe it or not, they even cut back on the lag bolts used to secure the mount to the wall.  Now, instead of 4 large lag bolts, they now give you 2 large and 2 small.  I used to be able to assemble one of these in 5 minutes; this one took 30.What's worse is they replaced the original Cheetah mount with this piece of crap, so they could keep all the 5-star reviews they had received on the previous bracket!  What they should have done is listed it as a new product, as they have completely changed every aspect of the product and certainly the quality.  Very deceptive practice!  I will certainly never purchase another bracket by this manufacturer.  They should be ashamed of themselves.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this!  You'll never level your TV!", "Author": "Jammies", "ReviewID": "R1V0WMANUZFGM3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "You'll notice the majority of the positive reviews about this product are from a few years ago.  Apparently since then, they've changed the design such that the supporting main piece comes disassembled and in four pieces.  I don't know if it's just incredibly difficult to assemble this properly, or if it's now just a bad design, but the actual mount frame IS NOT LEVEL.  As another reviewer mentioned, it's sort of like a bow-tie once assembled.  However, this is not noticeable to the naked eye.  You'll think you mounted this thing level until you go to set your TV upon it, and then you'll realize in frustration just how crooked it is.Like many other mounts, this thing goes into the wall studs with huge bolts, so there's very little room to make any corrections to the out-of-level condition.  Thus, you're left with moving it a few inches up or down on the wall and starting over.  I tried hanging this thing twice, and both times it was not level.  It wasn't until after the second try that I realized the problem is the mount itself and not my leveling skill.  Not to mention the level that comes with this thing reads differently if you have it upside down (yes, you read that right, there is a proper orientation on the level - apparently the top of it isn't as straight as the magnetic bottom side).Even though I didn't get this far, I noticed the tilt functionality has to be set with the TV off of the wall.  What's worse, both sides move independently of each other, so you'd better hope you get them lined up perfectly with each other before putting your TV up.  I would imagine this could take a bit of trial and error to get right.My final complaint is really more of an annoyance that was fairly easy for me to overcome but may pose problems for others.  The \"safety\" screws on the rails on the back of the TV that you screw in from the bottom once its hung are difficult to reach.  I used a very long screwdriver and a flashlight, but given how close to the wall the TV is, it was a tight fit, and there's no way you could get in the handle of the screwdriver or your hands between the TV and the wall.  So, if you're going to use this and actually care about properly securing it, you will need a very long phillips screwdriver to do so.  How long depends upon the size of your TV.  I used one that was about a foot long to reach the screws behind my 42\" TV.Overall, I would recommend folks stay away from this mount.

The box was tattered and looked like it had been through a war.  It was obviously a returned item, as the contents (hardware, etc) was not organized in any way.

Works well.  Cheap (cost, not quality) which is always a plus.One small issue which cost it 1start for me.  When you put any TV I say larger than a 42\" and you intend on angling it (using the upto 15degree adjustment), first realize that 15degrees is not really 15degrees, that only apples to say a 32\".  Once you get a larger TV the bottom of the TV will hit the wall before you even get to say 10degrees.  That really isnt a huge issue to me, but the bigger issueis once you get that angle you want, lets say you max it out in my case on my 60\", its barely 5degrees angle, you have absolutely zero ability to access the screw on the bottom side of the mount where you must screw it down to keep the TV from being lifted off the mount.So you thinking let me screw that bottom one first before angling it, well if you tighten the bottom one you cannot angle it anymore because the screw keeps it from allowing the TV to get angled because the angle itself requires more length between the bottom of the bracket mount and the top of the hook part.  So you have to losen the bottom screw at least 5turns then angle it.  Then once you angle it, good luck tigtening down the hand screw to keep the TV from angling more or being pushed back.Thats the biggest issue with these slim mounts, there is zero zoom to put even a screw driver in once its on the wall to make adjustments or tighten a screw down.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Jay", "Author": "A.

The box was thinner than I expected but that was ok.After reading all the hassles some people had with missing screws, levels missing, etc... I was pleasantly surprised to find everything there.  The level was included and shrink wrapped.  There was an unopened bag with all sorts of bolts, screws, drywall sinks, etc... and instructions.  The only thing that I guess was missing was a wall template, but you really don't need it.Assembly.The wall bracket isn't the one piece unit that's in the $30 version.  And the reason the box is slim is because you have to assemble the bracket.  No big deal, 4 pieces, 4 screws, and 4 minutes and I was done.  Once assembled the wall bracket is very strong and feels like one piece of metal.As I said I had a complete bag of screws, and there were screws that fit my TV in the bag.  To install the mounting to the back of the tv you place a hard rubber grommit on the top of the screw hole in your tv, place the bracket on top, and screw the bracket into the TV.  Repeat 4 times.Lastly I had to hang the mounting bracket on the wall,  Once I found the studs (easy as the electric outlet box is mounted to a stud, and then every 16\" there is another stud)  I mounted my bracket on two studs 32\" apart.  I did a pre drill with 1/8\" drill bit (to make sure I was in a stud) and then I used the 3/16 bit to make the pilot hole.  I screwed the bracket into the wall through that first hole.  The kit included strong wood boring screws.  I then leveled the mount (I used my own level, but the included level was just as accurate), and marked where to drill my second hole.  Once the fixed to the wall, I repeated for the last two holes.  I pulled on the bracket to test it, and it wasn't going anywhere.Lastly I used a 2\" hole saw to cut a hole in my wall behind the TV and down by the electrical outlet (until I can get a nice trim plate) to run the wires through the back of the wall.Had my sister in law help me mount it, and was done.Once on the wall tilting isn't that difficult loosen the bolt on both brackets and tilt.  I kept mine straight, without the tilt.All in all this was easy, worth the $22.  I don't know how a $100 bracket can hold the TV to the wall better than this one.

Certainly after seeing prices of $79-$180 in BestBuy, HHGregg and other stores, I was skeptical of this unit. I hate to admit it but I think we all sometimes have the \"if it's low cost, that means it's low quality\" thoughts. While this may be true for many items, I couldn't be more pleased with this mount.It comes packaged in a flimsy box, and looked like a crushed paper bag on my doorstep. But fortunately the contents were undamaged and accounted for. The hardware is well labeled and packaged. Others reviews have complained about the instructions, but I found them to be as detailed as they need be. Fortunately the product is not very complex and I guess most people can figure it out. It probably took fewer than 10 minutes to assemble the unit.Hanging the mount was easy. I didn't trust the included level but, when using my own, found it to be quite consistent. Continuous screw holes across the width of the unit make it easy to screw directly into studs. I was able to hit studs for all four screws I used, and the unit was tremendously secure. After screwing in the vertical bars to the back of the TV, you simply hang your TV on the unit as you would a picture on the wall. For safety, I suggest having someone help you with that process, though it could be done by a single person. When tightened, two screws under the mount secure the TV to be sure it does not magically fall off.In addition to tilting up and down, the nature of the mount allows for horizontal adjustment of the TV as well. The space for such adjustment of course depends on the size of the TV, but with my 42\", I have approximately 6\"-8\" L/R from the center of the mount. This came in handy when trying to mess with cables. Additionally, the mount creates adequate space between the back of the TV and the wall to plug HDMI, RCA, etc. cords without any special adaptors.For less than $25 shipped, I am extremely happy with this mount. I truly don't have any complaints. If you need a simple tilt mount that requires only minimal time to assemble and hang, I suggest this unit.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT", "Author": "Nick B", "ReviewID": "R2E61RJKG2S1JT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this product 5 months ago and had no issue with it until recently when I was watching television and it fell off the wall.

However after doing the initial install, i started to have my doubts.  I like the simplicity of the parts, however, you must remember that with simple parts you are only going to get simple movement with the mount.I'm just going to list off the flaws.1) DO NOT RELY ON THE LEVEL BUILT IN THE WITH THE MOUNT. That gives you a partial level measurement and is worthless if you have an uneven bracket (see number 2)2) check your horizontal bars. These are what carry the load from the tv and bolts into the wall.  However my top horizontal bar is bowed.  I realized this after utilitzing ONLY the provided level, but my eyes were screaming \"the bubble is lying!\"  a friend came over to help mount the TV and the first thing he said was 'dude thats crooked'.  Not only was there a slight slant, but the right side of the mount was significiantly lower than the left side and middle.  left side and middle were the same.  i took the mount off, uninstall everything and layed the metal bracket across the floor. Sure enough, the right side has a slight bow in it.  I tried bending it back a little, but it's as good as its going to get.3) the horizontal bracket holes do not align with the vertical brackets.  This is how you attach the horizontal and vertical brackets together. There are 1 hole per piece, 2 holes for each corner that line up and you screw a screw/washer in to attach.  This would be fine if the holes align properly but they dont.  I would have just drilled the hole (which would have cut into half of the pre installed hole)  but the pre installed holes are threaded, which means the screw would have not been able to screw into anything unless i had a similar sized nut laying around (which i dont)I'm not sure where everyone is getting this 'super solid steel' cheetah mount from, because the one that got delivered to me was made of pretty flimsy metal that is bowed, with holes that dont even align up properly.  If you do decided to go with the mount, double check everything with a level,  and if you end up with uneven holes, its going to look kinda funky until you have it on the wall. just make sure its bolted in tight.I dont think my TV is going to be falling off the mount, however i would definitely NOT BUY this product again", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy", "Author": "Robertson6572", "ReviewID": "RONY7GB0XW9UT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is one of the worst mounts I have ever come accross.

Why wouldn't it be? Because you have to assemble the wall bracket, and part of the assembly involves attaching the top and bottom (horizontal) bar, to the left and right (vertical) bars. Yes, the manufacturer saves on shipping, but the result of the assembly is that it doesn't work well with a 100mm hole pattern on your small to mid size TV. Why?A) The top bracket comes in two pieces, left and right, that must be bolted together. (Ditto for the bottom bracket). When the top bracket is bolted together, it is solid. However, the overlapping piece of metal that bolts and holds each side together, has a different dimension than each side, and is in the center of the resulting/combined bar. That overlapping piece of metal in the center of the two bars, interferes with the two vertical hooks/brackets to be attached to your 100mm TV holes. Your expensive TV will wiggle; perhaps it won't fall off, but it will not rest solidly. If the holes are further apart, the hooks will be wider apart. But with a 100mm configuration, the hooks are too close together and can't sit flush in the center because of that overlapping piece of metal holding the two sides together. One hook will be a notch higher than the other, thereby making your TV un-level. Of course, you can slide your TV to either side of the overlapping bracket, but then the frame will not be centered with your TV and would not be hidden behind. The worst configuration is on a sub 40\" TV with a 100mm hole setup, which is what I have.B) The frame of the bracket needs to be perfectly rectangular, but it likely won't be. This is because the top and bottom brackets are held together by two thinner rods running vertically on the left and right. This makes a difference because you will need the bottom bracket to be aligned perfectly with the top bracket, and those two thin rods don't easily keep 90 degree angles. This makes a difference, especially on a smaller 100mm hole setup, because you will want to use the bottom bracket to adjust the level of the TV by loosening/tightening the screws on the bottom of the vertical brackets. Good luck, because the bottom bracket may be too high to use as leverage if the bracket isn't a perfect rectangle.In short, the bracket may be fine for a larger hole configuration, but AVOID THIS BRACKET if your small to mid size TV uses a 100mm pattern. The worst part is that you can't visualize what I'm describing until you try to hang a small to mid size TV with 100mm holes. I guess its possible that someone out there had a great experience with a similar configuration, but I can't imagine how.... and I'm not going to touch the fact that the holes in the mounting arms are too large for the head of the bolts to attach your TV.

This could cause one latch to be slightly uneven compared to the other, which will tilt the tv slightly, but it is quite an easy fix.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not for my 65\" Samsung", "Author": "Stevie G", "ReviewID": "R21NYDRWCY6ADW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking to get something very low-profile to mount my newly purchased Samsung 7100 65\" LED.  When i first received the tiny box for this item I had doubts about if it would work with my TV.  The frame for this unit actually has to be assembled so it is very compact when shipped.  Ultimately Im sure it would have supported my 65\" LED, but the distance between the wall and the back of my TV with this mount is only 1.3\".  My TV has a combination of input jacks that come off the back, both sideways and some that come straight back.  The ones that come out straight back are the problem, specifically with the optical audio cable I was planning on using.  I would have had to bend the back of the cable at an undesirable angle to get it to fit.  I considered getting a 90 degree adpater, which would have allowed for the connection of the cable without having to bend it, but after considering my options decided to go with a more versatile mount that I could use, the ATDEC TH-3070-UFL Telehook, also sold on Amazon.  It has a full motion articulation and provide ample sapce between TV and wall (2\" min to 25\" max).  It costs severals times the price as the Cheetah Mount, but will provide the right versatility for me to connect all the cables I neeed and easy accerss to the back of the TV for future cable changes.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stud in center of wall - no problem!", "Author": "Voyager", "ReviewID": "RJ889ZF24GMN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used this to mount a 50\" plasma TV and I was very pleased with how flexible the bracket is.

I started putting it all together no thanks to the largely useless instructions and realized this thing would not begin to hold my TV. Or if it would, it wouldn't for long.The wall bracket is in four separate pieces, not one solid piece. Once it was built, it just felt lightweight and flimsy. The two brackets that mount on the back of the TV were just okay, but were only meant to hang on the top rail of the wall bracket. The bottom only sat against the bottom rail and was held (I use that term loosely) with bolts that could be tightened to kind of sort of hold it in place. The whole setup felt really chintzy.Before I made a relatively permanent commitment, I went to Best Buy and price matched with Amazon a $150 Sanus wall mount. Amazon had the same exact bracket for $60. Best Buy price matched and I walked away with a very sturdy wall bracket for $60. Much sturdier, wall bracket is one solid piece, and it's currently holding my plasma to the wall.I'll keep one of these to hang my lightweight LCD in my bedroom, but I would never trust it with a larger and heavier TV.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value on this inexpensive, tilting TV mount.", "Author": "JK-123", "ReviewID": "RPXO1L9NOT24G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off let me say, anyone who spends $100 or more for a tv mount when this is out there as an option is crazy.

Granted, if that's what you're after it is roughly what you pay for.  Still, that's what I was after and I regret not paying another 25 dollars (or somewhat more) and getting a more quality product.Unfortunately the design is poor.  Very poor.  I am frankly startled that it has received such good reviews.When screwing the top bolts into the frame the washers were slightly too large to lie flat and ended up at a slight angle, preventing the bolts from being fully screwed in.  The frame is also somewhat flexible and there was some curve that couldn't be removed from the top of it.  It did still end up being firmly attached to the wall.The tilt function will not be held constant by tightening the suggested screw.  When even a few pounds of pressure were exerted on it it still tilted regardless of how much the screws were tightened.  In the end we had to add additional bolts and nuts to force it to hold it without tilt.Even with the supplied spacers cords which protrude from the rear are very tightly squeezed between the television and the wall.  Removing them without removing the television is difficult if not outright impossible and I'm frankly concerned about the integrity of the jacks over the long-term.  This is even without any tilt: with tilt I think the entire weight of the television would be set against the cords (and without modification I could not prevent tilt).The supplied accessories are totally worthless.  The level is at best cheaply made and gave obviously slightly-off-level reads.  The HDMI cable is the kind of thing Best Buy should have on hand to try and sell monster cables.  I had massive quantities of static, flickering pictures, and entire dropped frames and seconds of audio over it: in short it is more useful as a rope than as a cable.Overall: I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It is simply not worth $25.  It is very cheaply made and isn't even functional out of the box if you want want to have any control over the vertical angle of your set.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Highest quality, lowest price!

The TV (55\"LG) is up and seems like it will stay up which is the obviously the primary objective.Now for the bad. This unit (and probably any unit) consists of two main parts. The part that mounts to the wall and the part that fits on the TV. I don't know if there are any industry standards but if the spacing holes on the back of my TV were 1 mm further apart this unit would not have fit. Luckily it did. The supplied spacers and bolts made for a secure fit.This mount has a tilt feature. This is on the part that fits on the TV. There are no reference marks that allow you to measure whether each side is the same. Further each side has two mounting claws and they have to be lined up as well. It's all done by eyeball. Not exactly confidence building.The part that bolts to the wall is straight forward except that you have to assemble it and some of the hardware is hard to tighten without a socket of the right size. Or you could use the less elegant way and grab it with a vise grips.I had a wall socket to work with. Naturally the mount ended up crossing the outlet. Not the mounts fault but it would be nice if there was some provision to lower or raise the center section of the mount for clearance. If you don't have a wall socket this is not relevant.The worst feature is that the mount has two locking screws to be utilized once everything is assembled and hung. This is a safety feature but it is unusable because there is no possible way to reach those screws. You'd have to have a very long flexible screwdriver and get very lucky since you can't see those screws to tighten them if you could reach them.Since the TV depends on gravity unless you foresee the TV jumping up in the air those screws can be left un-tightened, not that you'll have a choice. Perhaps if you were using a much smaller TV you could access the screws.So, in summary, the mount did the job but I am sure a little research and a bit more money would give you a mount that was thought out a bit better.

I think most would agree it's a great buy almost for that alone. The unit itself isn't bad either, if your handy enough to make necessary adjustments. This is the first mount I've purchased as I prefer my flat screen on a table. In any case, I purchased this to hang my new Samsung 43\" in the bedroom. I've read many reviews on this cheetah, some so bad I'm in curious how they could have received the same product as the reviewer above or below which were mostly outstanding. I think it simply comes down to two things. How handy you are and your TV. All my nuts and bolts came with the neatly packaged bracket and subpar assembly directions. Having to put the wall mount together, as its 4 pieces is something I obviously missed when buying. I'd recommend anyone reading, go for a mount wielded as one. But.. If ur trying to save a buck and again handy, go for it. After assembly It was time to mount, which was fairly straight forward. The mount wasn't heavy and I was able to hold it with one hand while I marked my hole locations with the other. Then finally drill with no problem. Boom! Mounted. Now here comes the s*** part. The TV brackets weren't long enough for my screen. I had to file the ends so that the bolts wouldn't rub resulting in them going through crooked. Had it not been for my roommate who had an industrial strength file and the wherewithal to even think about doing so. I would have been completely SOL with already so much time invested. K so yeah, maybe it's just my TV. But many people own Samsungs I'm sorry this is a design flaw. That said, the rest was Samsungs fault. All my connections HDMI, USB ect. are on the back not the side. Making it hang with a tilt impossible as the cables wouldn't allow it. So keep that in mind if ur connections are on the ass end. Back to the bracket. The safety screws are virtually impossible to tighten once the TV is up. The low profile design is nice. And I'm sure having to do it again wouldn't take the length of the Miami / Bulls game that was on.  It's seems really sturdy bolted into my apartment stucco walls (wood studs). Again the HDMI cable/leveler were nice additions. If I ever buy another mount however, it'll be another brand. Over all I give it 3 of 5 stars. 2 for price, 1.5 for the HDMI. That's it, cause nothings perfect. If you own all the necessary tools required. And then some. (a file) Your probably the kind of girl/guy that can get this to work for you.

When you locate where your wall studs are and determine your desired placement for viewing,draw a light pencil line with a real level,then flip the level and check it for accuracy.Mark the holes for the top to pre drill 2 holes for the 2 larger lag bolts in the centers of the studs dead center on your level line on the wall.Be sure you use a bit smaller than the thickness of the lag bolts threads.Use the washers and attach the 2 top bolts.Do not overtighten the bolts,just snug enough to recheck with a level on top,then tighten so they wont move anymore.Pre drill for the smaller lower 2 bolts usiing a smaller bit again,place the smaller washers on the bolts and snug them up as well.Attach the brackets to the back of the tv(be sure the tilt adjuster screws face outward),back off on the bottom rail set screws on the wall mount attach your cables and power plug and hang your tv.Tighten the bottom rail set screws and you are done.It will stay at about 15 degrees.Changing the tilt on this model is not much of an option,so just tighten the tilt screws as much as you can and you're done.If doing this is too difficult,have someone else do it so you will be sure your tv will not detach from the wall(a bad day for sure.)Overall, as I have said...a decent mount for the price,but if your tv is over 42 lbs,choose a heavier mount.This one did what it needed to do for me at a budget price.The included 10 ft 1.4 HDMI etherenet cable works well with my Panasonic 3D Blu-ray player.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid, inexpensive wall mount", "Author": "waetherman", "ReviewID": "R2UTL1NCT1GW8W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this mount specifically because the wall I needed to install to had 24\" studs, and this is one of the few mounts made to fit that wide pattern. It would also fit the standard 16\" pattern as well, though if your tv is on the smaller side (37-42) you might be better off getting a smaller 16\" mount because this one will be more visible behind the tv. Overall the mount works very well - the instructions are a little cryptic, perhaps because of all the various mounting options (masonry, wood, etc) but if your attaching this to standard wood studs it's as straightforward as can be; measure, pre-drill holes with a 3/16th bit, then put in the supplied wood screws. Easy, fast, and very solid. Holds my 40\" 55lbs tv just perfectly. I was a little disappointed that it is that far out from the wall, since the specs say 1.6\" and it's actually closer to 2.5\", but it's not too much difference. I think it could be more compact if the brackets that affix to the tv were a little more svelt - they seem overbuilt for their purpose and far too thick, though that may be to accommodate larger, heavier TVs and to allow for tilting the tv. Since my tv is at the smaller and lighter end of this mounts range, and I dont tilt the tv, the brackets seem unnecessarily thick, and I may try to find ones that will reduce the profile even more.The only negative I have about this mount is that there is no easy way to adjust the level after it has been installed. I've read about other mounts that allow for a bit of post-install wiggle, and that seems like it would be a very good thing to have as an option.

That does not mean you should avoid this mount or that it is inferior.Boiled down facts:Metal is thin but strongWhen hanging the monitor you need to hang with 2 people regardless of how strong you are to ensure that both sides hook to the upper rail properly.  Another concern is since the metal hooks are made from a thin stamped piece of metal you can bend them easily during install (e.g. hanging one side on the rail while then the other as opposed to two people hanging both sides simultaneously).If your video input panel is located on the back and is not deeply recessed (~1\" or more) then it is advisable to install the included spacers so there is enough room for the cables to bend without strain.  To user the M8 20mm spacers you will need to buy longer screws than what is included.  For example, my 42\" Samsung PN42B450 (plasma TV so by current standards it is heavy for it size vs. an LCD TV) needed to use the M8 screws  apx. 20mm needs to be able to thread into the TV.  I purchased Qty: 4 M8 40mm screws which after spacers, bracket and washers left me with ~18mm to thread into the TVs thread mounting sockets (head type doesn't really matter it can be hex socket (allen key), torx, hexagon, phillips).  Also without the spacers you will find it very difficult to release and tighten the tilt-lock  mechanism.So how is this different to a more expensive bracket?  Well, not much after it is installed.  On a more expensive wall bracket the metal is heavier (thicker) so when you hang the TV to the rails you feel and hear a confident \"clunk\" connection with very little play.  Also the tilt mechanism on a more expensive mount is smoother and generally easier to utilize.  However once the APTMM2B is installed and positioned there is no play and the TV feels just as secure as a more expensive mount.  Even while adjusting the tilt while the rails are locked to prevent left or right traveling the APTMM2B mount feels secure.  With that said, I would not feel comfortable installing any TV over 46\" for the simple fact that I think the rail hooks could easily bend under a heavier TV if you accidentally tweak them in process of hanging the TV.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poorly manufactured", "Author": "Lane Shields", "ReviewID": "R1F858MM8QETNA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I may have just gotten a dud unit, but the one that was shipped to me was clearly poorly manufactured.

The longest time took drilling the holes in the concrete wall that I was mounting it to in our enclosed patio.

The instructions are not as good as they could be, but the installation is simple and I'll list the step by step instructions below:1) Hold the wall mount up against wall with the rails facing you. Use a \"real\" level instead of the one supplied. Make sure the mount is level when you mark the four holes: 2 on top and 2 on bottom.2) Four lag bolts, 2 large (top) and 2 small (bottom), attach the wall mount to the wall. Pre-drill the holes - big bolt holes on top and small bolt holes on bottom. If drilling in a concrete wall, like me, make sure the holes are large enough for the plastic anchors to fit snugly. Don't use anchors for mounting into studs.3) Mount the plate to the wall with the hanging rails facing you. Tighten the bolts till they are snug - do not over-tighten the bolts.4) Using the hook side up, hang the TV brackets on the wall mount. Back out the retaining screw on the bottom of the hanging bracket so that it will clear the lip of the wall mount's hanging rail.5) Attach the hanging brackets to the back of the TV using the screws supplied (at least 4 sizes available). Be sure the hanging hooks are on the topside of the TV. Retaining screws should be on bottom.6) Hang the TV with the hooks on the bracket to the rails on the wall mount. I was able to hang my 37\" by myself. Get help with larger TVs.7) Screw in the retaining screws on the bottom, but do not tighten all the way.8) Slide the TV along the rails to adjust for your personal viewing. Snug up the retaining screws on the bottom of the hanging bracket.I only needed help from my wife to tilt the bracket outward while I adjusted the retaining screws.

Cheetah did a good job adding a variety of screws with their hardware package.  The material that it was made up of felt strong enough. I also received 2 separate levels (which were both a good tool when i was setting it up) and an HDMI cable. So they do give you just about everything you would need to set up your new mount. The only issue i had with the hardware was the size of the mounting screws. They put huge holes in your drywall.Set upTV: 55 Samsung LED TVWeight: Apx. 50lbsI read a bunch of reviews stating that set up was confusing and difficult. things didn't align well...I had very little trouble with the putting it together. It is pretty self explanatory. IT WAS WAAYY EASY! I would recommend buying a stud finder prior to drilling your holes. It makes a big difference when you mount the bracket. If you like the low profile i would also recommend purchasing a right angle HDMI adapter for your TV. you can purchase then here for cheap or from tiger direct for 10 bucks each.

I felt the instructions were pretty straight forward and I understood them well.  I believe others mentioned issues with understanding the lack of instructions but I had know issues.  Just read it and comprehend and thats it.  Look at the pictures when assembling the part mounted to the wall.My only issue, and reason for a star deduction, was how close the TV is to the wall.  I knew about this before but didn't realize the issue it would cause.  There is a screw in each arm connected to the TV that help lock the desired angle into place.  Also there are 2 safety screws at the bottom to keep it from coming off the mount.  I've been told this doesn't matter unless you have lots of earthquakes.  Well what do you know....last week we had an earthquake.....in Georgia.  Thankfully the TV had not moved.  Basically to tighten the 4 screws I would need a 16\" long phillips head to reach because my hand won't fit behind it.  It also is inconvenient when adjust, unplugging, replugging, etc. wires.The most difficult part was mounting it on my own (didn't have help at the time) and alignment.  One thing to consider is that the mount location on your wall is going to depend where your wall studs are.  Because I had a larger TV I ended up shifting my entertainment items below to make it centered and aligned with the TV itself.  It was only a couple inches.  Not a fault of the mount though.All in all, great mount, easy assembly, sturdy, looks great.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great for Samsung 7100 series.", "Author": "WyattC", "ReviewID": "R3GRS0ASPQ1PC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very slim mount for my Samsung 60\" 7100 series.

It took me about forty-five minutes to assemble, primarily because I was mounting it high on the wall and working with a step stool, so the up and down added to the time as I exchanged tools (or picked up things that I dropped).Putting the mount together is easy enough, although the assembly instructions varied from the actual screw positions on my mount horizontals. The mount is essentially a rectangle \u2013 the multi-piece horizontals and two, rather thin, verticals. It isn\u2019t obvious how the vertical pieces fit the horizontal rails, but as I played with them, they would really only fit one way.  Note: I suspect that in the reviews that had issues with screws not fitting, the people only tried to install the mount verticals one way. Trading the verticals out to the opposite side should allow them to fit. On each vertical end there is a 3/8\u201d tab with a threaded hole for a screw. It is off-center, so if the vertical rail is placed on the wrong side, the fat part of the tab will face the horizontal rail and make the screws impossible to align.My studs are 16\u201d and I found them easily enough with my stud finder. I used a finishing nail to make sure I had the stud centers and drilled the tap holes as deep as my bits would allow. I used my own 24\u201d level rather than the ones supplied with the kit to mark the holes. There are plenty of horizontal slots to attach the mount rails so you can easily center them for your space.I believe a couple people complained about the lag bolts breaking. I would caution as you ratchet them into your studs that you take your time. I had no issues with them, but I did drill good tap holes and slowly ratcheted them into place, not tightening them until I had them all in place. I ended up with a level mount that when my TV was hung, looked perfectly level.Mounting the verticals to the TV required four plastic spacers that came with the TV that fit into the TV mount holes before screwing in the screws. We mounted a Samsung 65\u201d LED TV on the mount flat and we used the supplied lock pins for a straight-up position so I can\u2019t speak to the tilt functionality. We just wanted it to be available if we ever needed it. Hanging our TV was a two-person job. My wife and I managed it with little trouble, even though we were raising the TV so it reached the top mount horizontal, up about five feet, and hooking it on the rack.As far as locking the bottom security screws, yes they are recessed from the bottom of the TV. At Kmart, I found a long Phillips screwdriver (overall length \u2013 11 \u00be\u201d, blade \u2013 8\u201d) for $6.00. I also used a headlamp flashlight so I had both my hands free. Before hanging the TV, I made sure the screws were loose and turning freely so I wouldn\u2019t need much torque to tighten them when I was ready. I easily found the screw heads and tightened the screws to secure the TV on the mount. My wife held the TV in place although that really wasn\u2019t necessary, just precautionary. The advertised space is 1.3\u201d from the wall and even with my chubby hands I had no trouble securing the screws. Actually, the only thing that gave me trouble was my glasses hitting the wall. So if you have someone handy, and without glasses, they could probably secure the screws more easily.Excellent mount for the price and I recommend it.

I used my awesome Franklin Sensors ProSensor 710 that I also bought on Amazon to find the studs.  I easily drilled into both studs on the first try.

Not so hot on a 200 x 200 mount - look elsewhere for this bolt pattern spacing", "Author": "SB_Fluor", "ReviewID": "RJ1W1CVHO8HS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I used this mount for a 200mm x 200mm horizontal bolt spacing on a 32-inch HDTV - and it stinks.  This is a poor design for this 200mm spacing pattern as it is. Let me explain.Here's the deal.  The horizontal rails on which the TV hangs are actually two smaller rails bolted together end-to-end by a ~6-inch long small steel \"patch\".  No problem in concept except that the patch bracket essentially doubles the thickness of the rail where it is bolted together.  Keep this in mind as we continue...The TV mounting brackets are U-shaped steel channels with two downward-opening V-shaped hangers on each bracket that are designed to sit nicely on the horizontal bracket.  So far so good, except...The problem with a 200mm mount is that TV mount brackets are about the same distance apart as the double-thick portion of the horizontal rail and if you do not place the TV EXACTLY dead-center on the horizontal rail, one of the TV brackets will be on the double-thickness portion of the rail and the other will be on the single thickness portion, and the bracket cannot hang level.  The inverted V shape of the hangers is allowed to sit further downward on the single-thickness side, and the double-thick portion prevents the inverted V from sitting as low as the single thickness side.  Thus there is no way to simply slide the TV along the rail a bit to center it where you want it without is being incredibly unlevel.  This whole deal is really problematic.After much wailing and gnashing of teeth and finding it impossible to level the TV, I found I needed to unbolt the WALL mount and slide that to center EXACTLY where I needed the TV. I was then able to place the inner of the two downward-opening Vs of each TV bracket on the very ends of the double-thick portion of the horizontal rail. This meant I have the outer of the downward Vs on each bracket hanging in thin air, but as this has safety screws, I figured this was adequate for my 15 pound TV.  But, if I had needed to move the TV even 1/4-inch either way horizontally, I would have the double/single thickness problem for an entire bracket, and I would need to unbolt the WALL mount again and recenter THAT.  This really isn't acceptable...Now, if your TV mounting holes are greater than 200 mm horizontally, your TV mounting brackets will likely fall on outside of this patch area on the horizontal rail, and both brackets will likely sit properly and evenly on the rails.  But remember that horizontal movement along the rail will be limited by the patch and you will have issues with leveling your TV if you move a bracket into the central double-thick zone.As much as the bracket itself stinks for my 200mm mount, the included 10-foot long HDMI cable worked well, the screws/washers/nuts came nicely labeled, the level was level (and handy), and the instructions were clear.So, if you have a 200mm mount TV, look elsewhere - there have to be better mounts than this.  For other, wider TV mount spacings, this should work, but again, there must be better designs that don't have the limitations imposed by this central double-thick splice zone.I would not recommend this mount as currently designed.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B Flat Screen TV Wall Mount Bracket for 32-65-Inch...", "Author": "StepanK", "ReviewID": "R2T19A1JTYYMHJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Cheap, but makes job done.

I've use other racks that when you loosen the lock, both brackets tilt evenly.  Don't know what the other guys do that Cheetah does not, but this rack doesn't tilt evenly.- The screws that come with the package are in metric... so if you have a US drill bit set, you will need to translate.  Unfortunately this results in a bit that is a bit smaller that recommended, and therefore harder to screw in.- The screws that come in the package are hex bolts with no philips or flathead top.  this means you will be hand cranking this into the wall instead of using your power drill. Very annoying. Other providers usually give you proper screws.- This rack expects you to tighten locking screws at the bottom of the rack.

Once I mounted the television, I find that it is nearly impossible for me to access the \"Safety\" screws to secure the bottom of the mount (I'm still working on finding a way to get at them). These safety screws are placed to prevent accidental lift off from the top bracket. As the TV is mounted high and I live in Maryland, this isn't too terrible a concern for me. If you live near a fault line and you're mounting a 60\" or bigger television, you should consider purchasing a mount with a different design.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap, Simple & Solid", "Author": "John Toews", "ReviewID": "RC2EGIYCYS353", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "4.5 stars: use your own level!Simple, inexpensive, & correctly mounted, it's totally solid.I'd recommend help boosting the TV up onto the wall bracket.I got everything mounted to the wall and to the TV.  Then I had my wife & adult daughter boost the TV up & on while I stood back and criticized.  Just kidding!  They did a great job.I COULD have done it all solo, one helper would be great and two was deluxe.Didn't time it but I'd guess half an hour.  My mechanical aptitude (MA) is good.  My Dad would have been struggling (MA \u2248 0).An overview to help Dad & his type:1)  The two big long pieces will bolt vertically on the four mounting spots on back of your TV; one on the left two spots and the other on the right two with the 'claws' at the top.Note: There is NO direct connection between these two pieces; they each attach separately to the back of your TV.2)  Once the other 6 pieces are all bolted together, they will mount on the wall.The top and bottom mounting rails each come in two segments that you will bolt snugly together.The two thin strips go (vertically) at each end of the rails to space the rails apart, forming a wide mounting rail rectangular 'frame'.3)  Use a stud finder to locate the studs in your wall (I never use drywall anchors if studs are available).The mounting rail 'frame' is wide enough that you will probably be able to mount on TWO studs....... IF you can only manage ONE stud, it will be near the middle of the 'frame' and, personally, I would use two HEAVY-DUTY** drywall anchors at EACH end of the mounting 'frame'.  **See below.4)  Using your own level, mount the top rail of the 'frame' Dead level on the two studs ... or ... 1 stud and a H.D.** drywall anchor at each end.  Then mount the bottom rail.5)  With a helper, mount the 'claws' of the TV on the top rail.  Be SURE that BOTH 'claws' hook securely BEHIND the lip of the top rail!  You're done!Now, good luck doing it for real!** Heavy-Duty Drywall Anchor:  I've never used this drywall anchor, but it looks great!  Better than the ones I use!  I'm ordering a pack today!

It was fairly easy to hang, there were a few screwups on my end but eventually I got it. To break it down in bullet points:- All of the loose nuts, bolts, washers, etc. come in a bag unlabeled. Be sure to organize the parts before you start.- The included level is nice, but not really necessary. A level is an essential tool everybody should have anyway.- The HDMI cable is cheap of course, but that doesn't matter. A cheap HDMI cable performs just as well as an expensive one. That's the beauty of digital signals. They either work or they don't. There is no in between.My big complaint about this wall mount is that it is extremely low-profile. TOO low-profile, in fact. So low-profile that you can't even use the HDMI cable they give you because your TV will smash it against the wall. You know you don't have very bright engineers when they don't account for a freaking WALL when designing a WALL MOUNT for a TV!But, with a few other product purchases and adjustments this can be worked around.1. Connect all cables to your TV BEFORE hanging it. You will NOT be able to reach behind your TV once it's hung and the safety screws are screwed in.2. Use only 90 degree HDMI cables. This is a must. You cannot use anything but 90-degree connectors because your TV will be less than an inch from the wall.3. If you have a TV in the upper range of this mount's rating (above 42 inches or so), make sure you have some very long-handled screwdrivers and a flashlight available. That is the ONLY way you will be able to fully secure your TV. That and loads and loads of patience.Overall, this mount is functional and can be made to work. The low price gives it points.But, the incredible lack of foresight and poor, barely-functional design makes this mount only deserving of three stars.In closing, make sure you have 90 degree HDMI cables, a long-handle screwdriver (Philips), a flashlight, and patience before attempting to install this.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Extremely High Value, Strong, Simple Mount.

The horizontal frame bar now comes in two pieces and when I assembled mine, the top pieces would not sit perfectly flush with each other. It was still level across so I went ahead and mounted it on the wall, only to find my TV would not sit level once attached. I remounted the frame, doubled checked it was level on the wall, but my TV still wouldn't sit level. Turns out the frame was slightly bowed, possibly due to the issue I mentioned above. I compensated for this by dremeling the bottom hole on one of the arm brackets to increase it's size, allowing it to shift slightly higher on the TV and make up for the unlevel frame. My TV now sits level, however one side is about a quarter inch farther away from the wall than the other (it's not parallel to the wall). It looks like alignment issue is causing one of the frame pieces to slightly twist, resulting in the difference in distance. This does not give me much faith in the overall strength and quality of the mount.The TV I mounted is a 60\" Panasonic Plasma (P60ST50) which weighs 73 pounds - well under the 165 pound rating of this mount.

Extremely solid, easy to setup, and comes with the hardware to mount just about any flat screen that's on the market.The back plate is bit lighter weight than my articulating mount and comes in two pieces that screw together instead of a single, solid back plate. I would have preferred a single-piece back plate, but in use, it doesn't seem any less sturdy. Since the TV doesn't have to extend or swivel on this mount, I can understand the design decision, and it works well.The included HDMI cable is nice, and the 10' length is handy since you'll often have a wall-mounted TV a little farther away from your entertainment center components. The only thing I didn't like about the items included in this mount kit was the bubble level. I placed it on a flat surface, and it was obvious that the bubble chamber was slightly off-kilter inside the level housing itself. So check your included level first before using it to make sure it reads correctly on each side.All in all, though, I am extremely pleased with this mount. Its sturdy construction and overall quality are well beyond its price point; you won't find anything this nice and for this price at any of the big box stores.

They are up behind the TV and once the TV is hooked onto the mount you only have about 1.5 inches of space between the wall and the TV. The second problem is that they are so high up that it's impossible to reach with any standard Philips screwdriver. So you can't see the screws because they are behind the TV, you can't feel for the screws because your hand can't fit behind it, and you can't reach the screws because they are so high up.

I also purchased the Arlington Industries wall plates to help route the cables into the wall behind the mounted set and then out of the wall behind my credenza. I have yet to install the plates; more about that later.When I ordered the set, the mounting bracket and wall plates, I fully intended to mount the LG set to the wall right away, but didn't. We ended up using the television set on its stand for about a month and finally decided to mount it to the wall. I approached the project as a one man job, eschewing the assistance of my wife, other than to have her show me where to mount the set. To reduce the suspense, I can report that the project went very smoothly, even as a one man job!Let's get started....  First of all, I attached the two vertical metal hook strips to the back of the set using the enclosed Cheetah Phillips screws and recommended spacing washers. I was able to do it while the set was still resting on its stand. In fact, I actually did the 5 minute job while the set was in use. Each bracket matched up exactly to the threaded screw holes on the back of the set. During this phase, I gained an appreciation of the challenge I'd have in routing the cables; see below.The next step was to assemble the four pieces of the wall mount bracket into the rectangular apparatus that is actually fastened to the wall. The bracket is fastened to the wall using the four enclosed lag bolts which are screwed into two adjacent wall studs. Where to position the wall bracket: Looking at the height of set as it was situated on the stand atop our credenza, I had asked my wife how much higher she wanted me to mount the set (vertically) above its current position. She said 10 inches. This meant all I had to do was measure 10 inches up the wall from the TOP CENTER of the set and make a light pencil mark on the wall. Now, I unplugged all the cables, removed the set from the credenza, placed it on its face and removed the stand and then put the set aside until later.It's key to mount the set exactly level and although I have several bubble levels, the bracket kit actually includes two levels, a torpedo level and a small level that clips to the wall bracket. This means I needed only to hold the bracket assembly tightly against the wall, centering on the pencil mark. Then I sighted the level (bubble in the middle of the marks) and drew a pencil line along the length of the top rail of the now-level bracket assembly. Piece of cake. I then found the two studs using my stud finder, marked the appropriate holes to drill, then drilled the four holes (the instructions tell you what size of drill bit to use and how deep to drill). Then I used a socket wrench to crank in the lag bolts, securing the bracket assembly to the wall.The Cheetah folks provide two sizes of lag bolts; the larger two are used to fasten the top rail, the smaller bolts for the bottom rail. Obviously, you will need to drill two different size holes in your wall. BTW, they provide the appropriate anchors if you have masonry walls. The good news is that the 30\" long wall bracket assembly is made of stout enough steel so that it won't flex under load even though the bolts into the wall are only 16 inches apart (the distance between the studs). As a result, the TV set (whose brackets' hooks are also 16 inches apart) can actually be moved 13\" back and forth along the top rail until you reach the desired horizontal location. Again, the wall bracket doesn't flex one bit; I was very relieved to see this later, because my set had to be at the far right end of the rail in order to center it on the credenza below, exactly where my wife wanted it hung on the wall.Once the wall bracket was mounted, all I had to do was return the set to the top of the credenza, resting it on a couple of bath towels. Then I inserted the six cables into their respective plugs on the set, gathered them together, reached up and hang the set on the top rail. There are a pair of set screws on the bottom of the hook brackets which will be used to further secure the set to the wall bracket once the installation is fully complete, a couple of weeks from now.In conclusion, WE ARE EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THE EASE OF INSTALLATION AND THE FINAL APPEARANCE OF THE SET UP ON THE WALL. One tremendous benefit of the set being wall mounted is greatly improved audio! The LG, like most really thin flat panel TV sets, has speakers which fire down and back, bouncing sound off the wall. This means the set's sound when on the stand is somewhat \"trapped\" between the back of the furniture and the wall itself. We always have the \"Smart Sound\" option turned on, which generates a synthesized surround sound. The set, now being hung on the wall, enables the surround sound to be all it can be; in my opinion, the audio is now 200%-300% better than it was when the TV set was mounted on the stand.FAIR WARNING! Cable management is going to be a challenge since the LG set unfortunately has three distinct locations where cables connect to the back of the set. Believe it or not, the LN Series has HDMI and USB connections actually coming out sideways from near the left edge of the set; others have commented on this in their reviews of the set. Thankfully the power plug comes down from near the center of the set. Unbelievably, the RCA and Optical inputs/outputs point straight back from a site the near the left center of the set. This configuration is the only shortcoming of the LG set. It means that the HDMI cables have to make a 180-degree turn and the RCA and optical cables have to make a 90-degree turn respectively as they exit the set and are gathered together with the power cable which exits downward. I don't think this challenge will be a deal breaker, but it greatly limits the exact location where the top wall plate can be mounted relative to the wall bracket and the set itself.Once the set is mounted, there is just over one inch of space between the wall and the back of the set. The cable bundle (in my case there are six cables) will have to be gathered together, zip-tied and inserted into the small wall plate opening for routing (inside the wall) 30 inches down to a matching wall plate opening behind my credenza where my cable box, Blue-ray DVD player and AV receiver are located. By the way, I plan to cut holes in the wall and install the Arlington Industries cable wall plates and route the cable through the wall at another time, but soon; stay tuned. After I complete that final aspect of the wall-mounting project, including painting the wall a new color, I'll review the wall plates.CONCLUSION...  Finally, check out the price of the Cheetah Mounts wall mount brackets! I challenge you to find anything as good for anywhere near twice the price or more! Buy this Cheetah if you have a 32\" to 65\" flat panel set to flush mount on the wall; it's simple, it's strong (will hold up to 165 pounds!), it's easy to install, and very inexpensive!

Here's what I encountered:- When I put the TV up on the bracket, without even tilting it down, it put way too much pressure on the cable coming out of the back of the TV, to the point that it was bent to 90 degrees.  This probably was exaggerated by the fact the the cable on this TV comes out of the back at the bottom corner, and being a low profile TV it doesn't allow much clearance in the first place.

With the bottom of the TV less then two inches from the wall, I literally couldn't get my hand behind it to tighten the screws.  I ended up buying a 2 ft. long screwdriver, so that I could tighten it, while I tried to find a better mount for my situation.  The top edge of the wall mount, while I'm sure is strong enough, didn't give me any level of confidence that I could leave the TV on the wall, without setting the safety screws.  Again, maybe not a problem for certain TV's.- For these same reasons, I really had no 'tilt' with this mount.

This happened to me, but for all the other benefits, I don't care at all. To fix this, you could possibly cut a hole right behind plugs in your wall... I might do this.Instructions are good, but I'd read through them once first.Overall summary:Simply put, if you want a solid, low profile, non-pivoting mount, get this one.

Tonkin", "ReviewID": "R2BDILT9LD8WAO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My first and hopefully last review, but I thought I should warn others based on my own experience.I bought two of these, one for a 40-inch set and the other a 50.  Overall, it's a great kit, easy to install and adjust. The reason for the 2 stars is that on the 50 inch set there is a flaw that is painfully hard to describe in text, but I'll do my best to explain so others can see if they may run into the issue.The two vertical struts that attach to the television hook to the horizontal struts, via a 'top' hook (on an adjustable 'lever' strut I'll call it) and a bottom hook that is on the vertical strut itself. The top hook rests on the top horizontal strut, and the bottom hook slips underneath the lower strut, and is secured via a screw that you screw that you need to tighten.  It's a very nice, easy to use setup.Based on my room, I needed to adjust the tilt to be the maximum 'down' angle. The problem with this is that the 'lever' strut needed to be extended to the maximum distance (i.e made almost flat) which in effect shortens the distance between the top hook and the bottom hook to the point where you simply cannot get the bottom hook over under the strut.  I had to reduce the tilt back to where the hook on the bottom can get over the horizontal strut... which unfortunately means you can't get the 'most' out of the tilt.It looks as though this would be less of a problem on smaller televisions, because you have some flexibility on where you have to screw the vertical struts on to the TV (which is nice), i.e you'd go higher if you wanted to increase the angle of the tilt, lower if you didn't need it. On larger TVs (my 50 inch is an example) - the screws were at the max top and bottom locations on the vertical struts.Apologies for a such a convoluted post, and if there is a way around this, I will happily change my rating, but I did try a bunch of alternatives - lifting a 50 inch TV up and down repeatedly was no fun!!", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "great wall mount for a flat screen tv...", "Author": "M.

And missing parts. This had me worried.that i would receive a product that would be poorly made. And it took 3 days just to start the shipping process. Figured they were throwing stuff in a box as they went. The box they used was a commercial box it wasn't like they just threw it in a paper bag.My experience was completely opposite. They provide you with more than enough bolts. Every tv is different they cant possibly match every TV in the world. But they sure did their best they offered 3 different sizes of mounting bolts. Everything was neatly labeled in plastic bags by letter, and part name.The instructions were so simple a 3 year old could do it. As with all machined equipment best advice is if something isn't lining up DONT TRY TO FORCE IT. Just think it thru turn it like a puzzle until things line up perfect.That being said, there were a few down sides that i've also seen from other comments. The adjustment of the swivel makes no sense to me. If you adjust it then the locking pin wont line up or the screws wont line up.. something wont line up if you swivel it.Finally the safety pins are a pain in the you know what to screw in if you have a thin tv. It's so close to the wall. And i wouldn't suggest not tightening them as any upward motion to the tv you risk the thing falling down. I had to find a socket that would fit around my screw driver, attach the socket to an extension arm... just to be able to reach the screw.I'd suggest that Cheetah consider making some sort of an extension rod that can be used to help reach them. Even if it's just a solid bar with a Phillips head on the end and a nut on the other that you can attach a socket wrench to and use it to reach the screws.I'm not sure how much this would raise the cost, and i  commend them on how many extra bolts and washers they provide. Those have to add up over time. just to have the extras thrown away.Another note, by the advise of my father who helped me hang the thing, an ex carpenter, we ditched the anchors since we were drilling into studs. Just drilled a pilot hole(tiny hole) and used a ratchet to screw the lag screw in. From doing minimal research on the internet(and i suggest you do the same) anchors are only needed for concrete or if you cant find the stud.Long story short, i  had a pleasant experience.

The capability to accomodate up to 24\" separation between studs was a real plus as well.  One word of caution, though.  The mount lives up to it's advertised narrow depth so be careful about choosing it for your particular TV.  If your cables plug in from the sides and/or bottom you will be able to plug them into your setting without too much difficulty.  But, if your cables plug into your set from the back then you may not have enough room between the wall in the set for the cables to fit.  In that case, go with a mount that has a deeper profile.  My TV has side and bottom mounted cable connectors but I still had to install the cables before I mounted the TV because the space between the wall and my set was still too narrow for my hands.  You also have to make the tilt adjustment before mounting to the wall as there is no room to do so once mounted.One recommendation to the manufacturer:  my set (Samsung 47\" LED) requires the M8 screws to attach to the mount.  The screws supplied with the mount were about 3/4\" too long and the spacers provided were not deep enough to make up for the extra length.  I had to go to my local hardware store for the proper length screws.  I recommend that shorter mounting screws be included to accomodate for the ultraslim profiles of current LED/LCD TVs.Overall, a good sturdy mount with all the hardware needed to mount just about any set with a VESA 400x400 mount configuration.

The older LCD's, at least my 46\" Samsung, the plugs for your cables plug straight in rather than newer LCD/LED's where they plug in from the side.  The cables stick out on the older ones causing them to hit the wall which will keep it from tilting only so far.  I think you can buy adapters maybe for hdmi, but not sure about component?I'm not sure what the mounting holes on our tv are considered(maybe VESA 700x400 since that says it goes up to) but the brackets that bolt to the back of it had no adjustment left once bolting it up.  My other mounts all have had some extra adjustment to allow me to move the tv up or down more if it needed to be if the mount was not in the right spot.I don't know what the standard mounting height of mounts are but I always go up 54\" from the floor and draw a level line and attach the bottom of the wall mount to that that line.  This might not work for you, but for somebody putting one up for the first time, this might help you.  A smaller tv, might need to be a little lower, but you can probably also move the tv down on the mount if you need to.  I just think in my opinion that 54\" is a good baseline.All the screws were in the package and I did not use the cable but I am saving it for a rainy day.  The mount will take you a few minutes to put together and you will need a phillips screwdriver and a metric wrench for putting it together.The tilt method on this thing is kind of cheap and you will need a long phillips to adjust it and tighten it if you want to adjust it once it is on the wall.  The mount is just cheap and it is hard to get the tilt the same on both of them since there are no marks to go by and it might not tilt evenly but you can figure that out.  The last complaint I have is the security screws on the underside.  On most of the other mounts I have used, they have a latch or a screw that will hold it in place and keep the tv from even being pulled away from the wall at the bottom of the tv.  The screws on mine, tighten up but do not tighten all the way into the bottom of the mount which will still allow the the tv to be shifted on the mount or you will think the tv will want to pull off at the bottom.  It will not but I just wish the company would have used a longer screw to have it tighten into the bottom of the mount.  It's not going to come off though and the mount does hold the tv.This mount does sit closer to the wall which leaves less space between the tv and the wall so this might keep you from tilting the tv to the desired postition if your cables are in your way.  If this is a problem, try another mount.  Peerless is a very good mount and I have used them in the past but they are a little more than twice the price.Give the mount a try though and if you don't like it, you can always send it back.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very secure", "Author": "C.

The wall is wood paneling and although I attempted to hit studs, they are few and far between, but this mount has held up great. I used some extra nuts i had in the garage to prevent the screws from coming out the other side of the wall (the screws are very long, a good thing).Now, the first TV is down and I have mounted a 60in Vizio LED LCD and I could not be more pleased. Once again, the TV sits very flush with the wall, but thanks to the thinness of the TV, it looks like it is a part of the wall and belongs there like a framed photo or painting.I have not used any other mounts, but I must recommend these for their very low price but very high quality.

The HDMI cable and level are just included to make sure feel like you got a good deal.The install:I used this product to mount a 60\" Panasonic Plasma over my fireplace.  I ordered this mount because it was cheap and had 1,000+ decent reviews.  I didn't notice that you cannot center this mount on a stud.  The only available studs over my fireplace were directly in the center of this mount.  That was an issue because this mount is assembled with 8 separate pieces with a metal plate right where I needed a hole for a lag screw.  I ended up drilling holes where I needed them which is probably not recommend.  Either way....after some modifications, I was able to use this mount but it is terrible quality.  I used 4 additional HILT drywall anchors in addition to two lag screws.

Here are my installation notes: 1) it so happened that where I wanted to mount the TV there was a stud in the middle, and the assembled frame holes could not reach the other studs, each 16\" from the center stud. The frame is about 32\" length overall. Generally one would just offset the frame to the left or right, but with a rather large monitor, I feared an off-center appearance in the end. The solution was to mount a 34\" long piece of 1\" x 12\" pine board and use (4) 3\" lag bolts with 1/4 washers to mount the board to the studs that were to the left and right of the center stud. Afterward mount the frame using (4) #12 1\" sheet metal pan-head Phillips screws with matching washers. There was enough space just below this mount to conceal a new AC outlet and an access plate for the A/V wires. 2) the mounting arms have a hardware accessory pack that is insufficient. Along with screw (a,b,c,d,or e) and star washers (f), add regular machine washers between star washers and the mount arms. Without these extra washers, the smaller screws may slip through the mount arms and cause your monitor to fall.

I removed the extension clamps on the wall brackets for a better fit (these were also too long for my 32\" TV and I did not need the extension supplied) however before mounting to wall, I added a 2 \u00bd inch square thick wood under each bracket to give the TV the recommended 4 inch air space between wall and TV-also so that the cables would fit properly and easily.

It seems to work well and the TV seems secure.  The directions are a little bit confusing, and I have the following tips:1) The mounting bracket you screw to the wall does not need to be centered, it just needs to be relatively in the right location and screwed into the studs.  The plastic screw anchors that come with it are for concrete wall applications, they are not drywall anchors.  You need to secure this to the wall studs.2) You need a LONG Phillips head screw driver in order to secure the final attachment of the clips that anchor the TV to the mounting track.  The TV will stay up without the bottom being secure, but in order to prevent the TV from falling if it is bumped, you are supposed to secure these screws.  A standard size screw driver will not reach.  Make sure these bottom screws are backed out most of the way before mounting the TV, or the TV will not sit flat against the back of the wall making it difficult to adjust the tilt.3) Have patience with adjusting the tilt.  The tilt is designed to be set once and locked permanently in place via screws only accessible when the TV is not mounted on the wall.  We had to take the TV on and off the wall several times before we had the right angle adjustment.  The left and right mounts of the TV also adjust separately and you had to eye-ball them to ensure they were both at the same angle.Overall, for the price, this mount is great, just make sure you pay attention to the installation instructions reading all the way through, and know that this is NOT the mount for you if you want to adjust the angle of the TV after initial installation.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "An economy mount that holds up very well", "Author": "James Beswick \"Thanks for your time\"", "ReviewID": "RL0CX37GPC22F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While the instructions are somewhat lacking, it only takes a few minutes to see that this is essentially two horizontal bars on the wall and two vertical bars on the TV which hook into each other.

Since many TVs have all their connections on the back, they're impossible to reach once the unit is on the wall. Second, don't forget to tighten the vertical screws under the hooks that secure the TV from being accidentally moved upwards once installed. These are very hard to tighten if you opt for the maximum 15 degree tilt.Overall, this initially seems like a less substantial unit than the $150 ones you see at warehouse stores but its actually very sturdy and well designed.

That one I bought for $20 and the quality of the steel was superb. I figured I'd be getting more of the same with this wall mount.

After all, I could always return it if I decided I wasn't convinced it would be able to hold the weight of my television. So I decided to go ahead and mount the TV with this unit. Installation was a breeze. I used the 6\" level it came with. The small level that comes attached to the center of the mount itself had broken off, probably during transit - no biggie.

The box was too light to be a wall mount! Surely there was something missing. After unboxing, however, I understood why the mount was so light. The manufacturer did a really good job at eliminating unnecessary bulk and material from the product without significantly reducing its effectiveness.The wall plate comes in four parts - two horizontal bars and two vertical strips that connect them. The top horizontal bar comes with a built-in level AND the package includes a level with a handy magnetic strip. There was no way I could mount this thing crooked now! (To be fair, if there was a way, I'd probably find it.) Placing the plate flat against the wall was a bit of a challenge, I suppose due to the fact that it's four separate pieces instead of one solid piece. It's flexible enough, though, to be a non-issue once it's actually mounted to the wall.For my particular installation I was mounting into two studs. The instructions listed that included were 2x 8mm bolts and 2x 6mm bolts - that the 6mm were to be used on the bottom and the 8mm for the top. I couldn't tell the difference between the bolts. They all looked to be the same size. Also, the instructions said to use a 1/8\" drill bit to create a starter for the 6mm, and a 3/16\" for the 8mm. I found both of those to be too small; on a couple of the bolts, the cordless drill/screwdriver binded up and couldn't get the bolt all the way into the wood (it's an 18v Milwaukee that usually blows through any task I put it to, so the fact that at full torque it was unable to fully secure the bolt was odd.) I ended up going 1-2 sizes larger (I can't remember now what it was exactly, maybe 9/64\".) The bolt still fit snug into the hole afterwards, and I had no concerns about the plate's ability to withstand the weight.The brackets installed on the back of the TV just fine, although I had to use the spacers because the screws were a bit too long and tightening the brackets down was impossible without them. (Despite the fact that the instructions say \"these are seldom used,\" this is not the first time I've had to use the spacers due to this problem.)Once the TV was mounted onto the plate, I realized just how flush this mount really gets to the wall. Working behind the TV was quite difficult; my hand/arm barely fit, and with some discomfort. I would recommend having as much plugged in as you can prior to placing the TV onto the wall. I have a similar (but more expensive) mount in the another room of the house, and while it sits a little ways further from the wall, it's easier to tilt and get hands behind if/when necessary.Speaking of tilt, the tilt mechanism was awkward to me. The brackets are loose out of the box, and placing the TV causes the weight of it to tilt slightly forward; however the degree of tilt seemed so minor that it was hard to tell if it really was tilting. I used a level to confirm that there was a moderate tilt, but again comparing to a more expensive mount, it's not as apparent. I attributed it to the fact that it was already so close to the wall.As a side note, I thought it was odd that the mount came with an HDMI cable, but the cable is of good quality and quite long. I was actually going to need another HDMI cable anyway, and so the inclusion of one was very welcome (especially considering that a cable of this quality and length is typically about the same price as the entire mount it came with.)All in all, I recommend this mount for basic TV mounting. If you want excessive tilt (i.e. mounting over a mantle) or need to angle the TV left or right, then it won't work for you. But I think the mount's best pro is also its biggest con. It mounts so flush to the wall that it's difficult to work behind, but at the same time it looks really great - almost as though the TV was mounted directly to the wall. The tilt is enough for mounting 60-66\" from the floor, then comfortably viewing from a sitting position.SUMMARY - RecommendedPros:- Lightweight, makes price reasonable and installation easy- Includes a magnetic level AND a built-in level on the wall plate- Extremely flush to the wall, looks very clean- Included HDMI cable is long, great for running inside a wallCons:- Instructions were a bit unclear- So flush to the wall, it's difficult to work behind- Tilt is minimal and awkward to manage", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great product, terrific value!", "Author": "GeoStork", "ReviewID": "R1O5BWCR185BVQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't usually write reviews but thought I would contribute regarding this product due to some of the conflicting reviews present here.

The included hardware is versatile, with all the mounting hardware you need for a sheet rock wall, whether you have studs to mount to or not.PROS:1. Good value. This is a very functional mount at a very reasonable price.2. 25-degree tilt. This is a nice feature when your TV is mounted high on the wall. It allows you to angle the TV down towards the viewers.3. Lots of mounting hardware is included. There should be sufficient hardware to mount most TVs on most walls.CONS:1. The instructions are written assuming you have studs to mount to. If your desired location is between studs, the instructions leave you hanging, so to speak. They are also incomplete regarding the assembly and spacing of the top and bottom brackets. Finally, they give measurements for drill bit sizes in metric, although there is one reference to SAE.2. CONNECT YOUR CABLES FIRST, before mounting your TV. The vertical brackets are not very deep. The result is that, once your TV is hung on the mount, there is little room reach behind and get cables connected.3. The TV mounting screws were too long for my Sony TV. They would not screw all the way in. Although the kit included spacers, they were for the largest screws -- not for the screws I needed for the Sony. I ended up sawing the bushings in half using a band saw. This isn't Cheetah's fault, but rather an example of the lack of true standardization among TV manufacturers.If you are even somewhat mechanically inclined the instructions aren't much of a hindrance.

I guess people believe that you have to pay for reliability. But nothing could be further from the truth.This is the second Cheetah mount that I have installed. The first was for a lighter Vizio 32 inch LCD. No problems with that mount so I decided to try Cheetah again for an 81 lbs. 42 inch Samsung plasma.I wasn't sure about the design of this model considering you have to assemble it. The first mount, like most, was made like a flat plate that could distribute the weight of a TV to all four bolts screwed into the wall studs. Although it looks like this model could not do the same, when assembled, the vertical bars are more than capable of spreading the weight to the bottom horizontal bar. Also, the unit is considerably sturdy after assembly.I noticed that there were complaints about missing pieces and the built-in bubble level. I purchased my own lag screws to bolt it onto the wall and I would never trust a built-in level (since the one that was built-in came cracked open, I didn't have to worry about it anyway).A major advantage to the design of this mount is the open back. I was able to install an outlet box between the top and bottom bars. All of my connections (power, two cable lines, and two telephone lines) come in directly behind the TV. With the addition of a cable management track, this looks like an almost professional install. I have not seen mounts that give you the ability to install an outlet box in this fashion.The looks can be very deceiving with this mount.

Plus, a good quality HDMI cable is included, along with an assortment of screws, bolts & washers for just about any situation. Both a small and a large level are included. Although some buyers report different experiences, the levels in my kit differed by only a fraction of a degree from my 4-foot-long pro level, so I didn't even bother using my 4-footer for this job.The instructions for assembly are both written and drawn, and both could use some work. Personally, I think the written instructions could be done away with, and just good, large, easy to understand drawings would be perfect for DIY rookies. As other reviewers have mentioned, the written instructions could be better and the drawings are so tiny, they're not much help.There are only 8 main parts to this bracket: the two biggest pieces are the two arms that attach to the tv as well as mount on the wall bracket. The remaining 6 pieces are what you screw together to form the bracket that is attached to the wall.I ended up tossing the instructions. I just started by attaching the two arms to the tv, then took the remaining 6 pieces, laid them on the floor, and it was obvious how they fit together to form the wall bracket.All the screws needed for assembly and attaching the arms to the tv and attaching the bracket to the wall are included. The various screws, washers, etc. provided are different diameters, so if fits, it's correct.For mounting the bracket on the wall, I first measured to get the correct height, drilled one hole in a wall stud, and attached the wall bracket with just that one screw holding it in place. Then, I checked to make sure all was level, and that the holes in the bracket lined up with the center of the next stud. They did, so I then drilled the second hole. And so on. Anyway, this technique is based on past experience with other projects. Don't drill all the holes in the wall at the same time, because if one or two are off due to a wrong measurement, you've got a problem that can only be solved by drilling more holes.Depending on where the connections are on your tv for the various cables and the power cord, you might need to get them all hooked up before mounting your tv on the wall. If all your connections are on the side or bottom of the tv, then no problem. If they're in the back, especially in the back towards the bottom, it's real tight back there with this bracket after your tv is hanging on the wall, making inserting any plug almost impossible.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheetah mount sux", "Author": "James M.

Poor quality control had the pre-dilled holes on the horizontal pieces too large on the unit I received, so I could not attach the vertical brackets using the provided screws.

Luckily, it wasnt too difficult to go through with after some guidance via other reviews. Pretty simple and straightforward; construct the mounting plate, put it on the wall. attach the arms to your tv, and have at it.If you plan to use the full tilt however, as I did, tightening the screws at the bottom (which basically secure the mount even further for the event of an earthquake and such) is about impossible. The best result I had was to tighten the bottom screws FIRST, loosen the tilt bars, and then slowly loosen the bottom screws a little at a time. As you do, the tv will naturally tilt down, but because you pre-tightened the bottom screws, they will still \"bite in\" as you loosen them. Using this method I was able to finally get the tilt I wanted with having the bottom screws safely tightened. Doing it any other way (such as tilting, then attempting to tighten the bottom screws) proved to be impossible.I had a TON of loose extra material after I was finished, which was terrifying at first, but it happens to everybody. They just happen to pack material for any given scenario, which is nice.Bottom line, if you can deal with lackluster instructions (you know you can), this affordable, sturdy mount is a steal.

The bracket was relatively easy to mount to the wall and the bracket hangers mounted easily to the back of the TV with the included hardware.  The problem I had was with the hanger  brackets.  After hanging the TV in  the top bracket channel,  I thought the worst was over, but not so.  At the bottom of each of the hanger brackets there is a set screw that must be tightened locking the bottom of the hanger bracket to the bottom channel of the wall bracket (this stablizes the TV on the bracket to allow it to tilt without the bottom of the TV swinging away from the wall).  After the TV is mounted to the wall there is absolutely no way to get a philips head screw driver behind the TV to tighten these set screws.  Because of the close clearance behind the TV (1.3 inches) there is no way to access these screws.  The TV probably will not come crashing down, but I did not tighten those set screws and care must be taken when using the tilt feature.  Also be sure to make cable attachments to the back of the TV before hanging on the wall-there's no clearance to make connections if you don't.  This bracket may work better on smaller TV's...A few days after this review I received a call from Cheetah Mounts.  They seemed concerned about the difficulty I had as stated above with their product and assured me that their design team is in the process of reviewing and redesigning the above mentioned set screw configuration on the bracket.

This is a good width mounting plate at 17.5\" for smaller TV's as it doesn't extend past the right/left edge of the mounted TV. I'll grant them that.However, think about this. Unless your studs are EXACTLY where you need them, this will NOT span two studs. Because the stud in MY wall is exactly in the center of where the TV mounts, there is not 16\" on either side to screw into another stud on the right of left (the mount, once on that stud, had 7\" extending right and left, or 9\" short of the next stud to either side). With a TV that weighs about 40 lbs, two screws into one stud is more than sufficient, however. But keeping it straight since there are only two screws, well, that took a bit of ingenuity that I won't go into here. But it was tough, I'll let you know.The big catch? The tilt adjustment doesn't suit anybody. You simply can NOT access those two tiny screws that secure the tilt aspect unless you have pencil thin arms, or a 3 FOOT (yes, 3 FOOT) long screwdriver. My suggestion? Adjust the tilt BEFORE mounting, because once it's on the wall, you'll never touch those adjusting screws again. You'll SEE them teasing you, saying \"Come on, just TRY to adjust me you little bugger!!!\", but you won't actually be able to ACCESS them without massive wall damage.Finally, when it slides down over the top bracket, to use screws to secure the bottom of the mount to prevent unwanted lift off is cumbersome. Good luck tightening them without leaving massive scratches on the wall beneath the TV (I'll be painting my wall tomorrow). It's so close to the wall, you simply cannot tighten them without the screwdriver handle marring the wall. They ought to use spring loaded releases to secure to the lower rail like the big boy brands do.So, if you're on a REALLY tight budget, this is a fairly good deal. But if you 1) want to adjust the tilt once it's mounted; 2) remove and reinstall; 3) or secure it to the wall without scratching the paint; I'd suggest you look at a different brand.I've installed about 100 sets (I am a home renovator), and this mount, by far, is the least user friendly. It gets the job done, but you certainly pay the price in time/effort/wall damage. Take heed, because this is NOT a sampling defect. This is merely how it's designed, and you cannot get around design flaws.I gave it two stars because it has the narrowest wall plate at 17.5\" out there, and was the only one I could find that was narrow enough not to extend past the edges of my 28\" plasma TV (it's an older model from when they first came out, as you can tell by the small size).Good luck!CoachRobMD", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Okay if you have a smaller TV", "Author": "D.

It worked okay when I used it to to hang my old 42inch plasma for testing (it was able to fully tilt).It's just okay if used without the tilt, but in order to use the full tilt capacity with my 70inch TV I had to bolt risers made from 2x4 lumber to get the TV far enough away from the wall. Without the risers the bottom edge of the TV contacted the wall which prevented it from titling completely.  Another downside is that there isn't any means to adjust the set for level after hanging it on the mount (and making sure the mount is level doesn't mean that the TV will be level when hung on it). It's impossible to use the locking screws to secure the TV to the mount if the mount is tilted to full capacity, which is a design flaw. If I had to do it again, I'd buy an articulating tilting mount that allowed for leveling. I'm going to have to make some kind of shim to level my TV.

I want to say its 1.3\" or 1.7\" thick. The title clearly says LED on it, yet when you receive the packaging the manual nor the box say LED. They only reference LCD and Plasma displays. The kit does come with several different bolt sizes depending on the type/brand of TV you are mounting. The bolts I am referring to attached the rear of the TV to two brackets which attaches to the mount fixed on the wall. The M6 bolts were wide enough to fit the threads in the rear of my screen only problem was they are the wrong depth at 24-25mm. When fully tightened there was about 1\" of wiggle room where the mount would sag against the wall. The bolts needed for an LED screen should in all actuality be around 12mm depth. So I had to get creative and double up on the supplied plastic washes, which meant drilling out four of them to reduce 1/2\" of wobble (GAP) between the TV and the two vertical brackets.This minor issue can cause a lot of customer confusion and will create a lot of returns for the vendor.

(It still works)Amazon Pro's:I am not sure who was at fault, either Cheetah or Amazon, but I was missing the free 10' cable and bubble mount as stated above in my con's.  After speaking with an Amazon representative, I was informed that Amazon could not replace the missing items as they were not the seller (it was a seller going through Amazon).  The representative then informed me that I could return the mounts (that I had already put together and installed) for a full refund.  I explained that I didn't want to go through the hassle of unmounting the tv's and taking apart the mount.  The representative then provided an alternative of refunding 20% of my order total.

The tv is about 40 Ibs easy, but so far after three weeks of installation, it had no issues what so ever.  The installation is fairly simple, about 45 minutes with a help of another person.  Most of the installation time were spent screwing the 2 locking pins(screws) that keeps the mount from unhooking on the rail.  You may need to reach under the TV and use a long screw driver while someone holds the flashlight over your head to see the locking pins. Otherwise this product is a better option than those heavier and larger mounts sold elsewhere.  And since its a smaller mount, the TV can rest closer to the wall which gives it a cleaner look because the TV feels more like part of the wall.  I had a larger mount in the past that was more expensive and heavier so it adds more stress to the wall (and my wallet).

TYLER \"CrAcKSTim\"", "ReviewID": "R2SO1C992DN93B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OVERVIEW:  This will be my second TV wall mount, the first being a swivel design.  It took me about 1.5 hours to install and mount my TV without power tools.  I installed a 46\" LED Samsung TV (really skinny and hard to get back there now).PARTS:  All the parts that I needed came with this system.  It was awesome that they gave me the extra screws as my TV (Samsung) did not have the screws for its wall mounting system.  The level device was decent and the HDMI was a great addition.  It is 3D ready in case you need to know, and I think it's about 9' long which comes in handy.MANUAL:  The instruction manual was good.  It covered most of the information that I needed, although more detailed pictures or a better description would have been nice.  I had to take off one of the brackets because I didn't study the picture carefully, which could have been resolved through better manual design.INSTALLATION:  Installation was pretty simple.  It would be nice to have some power tools when installing the wall mount screws, as they are long!  Their stud finder guide was really helpful as I did not have a stud finder.  The only issue I had was installing all the cords after it was setup, be sure to do as many of the connections prior to bringing your TV up there as you can.CONCLUSION:  I use the mount at the 15 degree tilt and it works great!  I have not tried to adjust the tilt after it has been mounted.  The construction of the steel and the welds seem sturdy and strong and I have no fear with my TV being mounted to it on the wall.Hope this has helped you!", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "A tv mount.

It can hold up tp 165 pounds meaning it can hold up a TV of up to 165/4= 41.25 pounds in weight. My TV was a 42\" and 32.5 pounds and I'm using a tilt of 15\u00b0, which does put added pressure on the top part of the mount, all will be fine. You are always best of using your wooden studs in wall with the included 3/16\" bolt screw. The leverage this gave the tv was more then I dreamed of, specially having used a couple of other mounts before. Now if you want added support use a slightly smaller wood drill bit and drill your 2\" hole, this allows the bolt screw to latch onto even more wood and is better then the one they recommend(3/16\" drill bit). I used a size 5/32\" bit. All that aside this took me roughly an hour to construct purely because I was single handed and lacking some of the tools to put this together(My Philip screwdriver seemed to object my use and hid from me, for over 15 minutes).  Now I had read some negative reviews and know they are mostly of human construct. The cheetah mount brought more then enough items for use in case of extraordinary measures. It brings 3 different standard sized TV back screws for the TV and enough locks. All the pieces where simple to assemble and I did not need to look at the manual. I have never mounted a wall mount on my own need I mention. This Mount seemed more then adequate and the best part was the leveling, it was quite easy to do and was made even easier by cheetah's inclusion of one.THIS IS A NOTE FOR THOSE WORRIED ABOUT EXTRA UNMARKED PIECES:\"Keep it simple stupid\" comes to mind, this is a simple project and all those extra pieces if you don't know what they do, don't worry. They are only for extraordinary circumstances.The only Con i noticed was the manual on this was sub par. The pictures where far and hard to make out as well as the instructions where generic and not very helpful. I simply ended up looking at the picture on the box and going from there. How hard can it really be? its a frame attached to your wall with another frame hooking onto it at 15\u00b0? This mean human ingenuity is most certainly welcomed but not required at all. If you're having a hard time stop being stubborn and ask someone else, if you cant figure it out. Don't have anyone else? Use youtube!On the Amazon forums you can find quick guidelines on how to spot knockoffs. Usually the number one sign is a generic white box for a non generic item. others would be sub-par quality and bad or no customer service.

The design leaves a bit to be desired.1. The piece which attaches to the wall is in 6 pieces.  This requires some assembly which isn't a big deal, just make sure you have some very small sockets so you can tighten everything down.  My biggest issue is that you cannot slide the TV around to get it into the perfect spot because the middle joint prevents the hooks to move around freely.  1 piece designs do not have this issue (and cannot be shipped in such a small box).2. The hooks that mount the TV are all separate.  If you're trying to line up an angle properly, you have 4 hooks to adjust.  There are other designs where each set of hooks is a single piece making adjustment easier.  Also, the hooks are very thin so it doesn't slide side to side very well.3. The screws to prevent liftoff are tough to get to once the tv is mounted.  You'll need a really long screwdriver to get to them.  Other kits have a spring loaded clip which makes the locking screw unnecessary.If you don't really need an HDMI cable and a questionable level, it's worth spending $10-$20 more to get a higher quality TV mount.  This is really a one-time purchase/installation, so personally I think it's worth the extra money.

I notice it with my level (USE YOUR OWN LEVEL ONLY) on the bottom part of the frame which is no big deal, because we care about the top part of the frame which was straight more or less.Second problem was the left arm, bottom portion where the security screw was is, the metal around the screw was not bent completely at 90 degrees, preventing the TV to lay flat against the wall bracket.

This bracket comes in a small box which is advertised to reduce shipping costs and will drive some assembly required.

It seems simple until after you put this together and realize it is more crooked than a Detroit politician.  After spending an hour getting things lined up here and getting this mounted to the wall, I got the real Rubix Cube of the assembly.My TV took the smallest screws provided to mount the two vertical brackets to the back of the TV.  These screws come with nifty star washers to help lock things into place and prevent them from backing out.  Unfortunately when I installed these, only one little sliver of the star was making contact with the bracket.  Much like you would imagine a thong on a very large woman, this thing was holding on for dear life.Once the brackets were mounted, I learned of the additional \"feature\" that allows for 3 degrees of rotational adjustment.  This just means there is enough slop with the various screws that you could get your TV to rotate.  In my application, I was so out of square with the mounted TV I'd have to break my neck to just make watching the thing a possibility.  After 2 hours of cursing and removing/re-installing the TV I got everything secured and square.All in all you get what you pay for here.

I bought this mount based on the reviews, but after reading more and more about this mount from more recent reviews I've realized I've been dooped! This model has been redesigned for the worse! If you read reviews from November 2013 and after, you'll see others have noticed the same thing. After I figured this out, I felt I had to investigate.Here's what has changed:The Wall Bracket has been redesigned to require assembly! It took me 20 minutes just to put the darn wall bracket together!- 10 screws, 6 different parts just in the wall bracket!!The metal is thinner and flimsy (I think) based on the reviews and the product weight change difference.- My question is, how can this be the same 165lb strong mount when the wall bracket is no longer one solid piece and the metal has been thinned out???Aside from the fact I was deceived, the installation was grueling and painful. Like I said, it took me 20 minutes just to put the wall bracket together, but the cheap hardware and poor instructions required a lot of trial and error to just get the right sizing for my 55\" TV. And once installed, the crummy bubble level was not accurate and I had to adjust the angle to make sure it was level!Once I got my TV hanging from the wall, it seemed to hold but after further thought and second guessing, I took the TV down and bought a more reliable mount from the store. I couldn't trust this piece of junk with my TV.

We have a 47\" TV and we were mounting on a stone fireplace in a new house. We are so conditioned to seeing mounts in excess of a hundred, so this was surprisingly affordable compared to the major big box retailers.When we received it, it looked to be pretty sturdy in materials, but I decided I wanted to have some larger bolts actually attach to the stone. We got some lag bolts and washers at HD and used those in place of the provided hardware (for cents) and I felt much more confident in the ability to hold. My only complaint is that when they say flush... it really is flush! Because it's on a stone fireplace, we have trouble getting our hand behind the TV to hook up cables, power, etc. This should all definitely be done BEFORE you attach the TV to the mount. If you're on a flat surface (drywall) however, this may not be an issue. Other than that, I love how close it sits to the wall and we were able to get it at the perfect viewing angle.Don't let the low price fool you - this is literally the same style and type of all the other TV mounts, you just aren't paying for retail space, fancy packaging or overly instructive instructions.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worked as advertised - tough to adjust", "Author": "Rusty_In_OR", "ReviewID": "R289RK3YK1YVD2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Everything on this worked generally OK, but the design is very tough in the final adjustments.  Here's my issue ... if you want to take advantage of the down-angle, you have to wait until after the TV is hanging because you can't hang it with the angle in place, or with the bottom set-screws tightened.  So then you hang the TV flat, the screws on the sides to tighten the angle are 'very hard' to reach, and the set screws on the bottom once the TV is at an angle are \"pretty much impossible\" to get to.  So you have the choice of hanging the TV flat against the wall with nice tight set-screws, or hanging the TV on a down-angle, knowing that if you have an earthquake, your TV will likely end up on the floor.  Love the product, but I often wonder if people that design these things, have ever actually used them.  BTW ... we opted for 'hang at an angle - hope there aren't any earthquakes'.

Then came to know that I need a stud locator for finding the stud inside the drywall. Luckily I found couple of youtube videos on stud finder using a magnet and hearing the sound of knocking the drywall. Made couple of holes before finding the actual center of the stud. Then it was just matter of time to drill holes and install the frame using the screw provided with the kit. It was very easy to install the mount and frame looked very sturdy. Installed hangers on 60\" Vizio e601i-a3. Kit provided most of the hardware for various size of TV's. Till now I was working alone.Then I need to install my 60\" Vizio on the mounts, which was impossible to do alone so I asked my wife to give a hand. One mistake I did was not to install the HDMI/audio/video cable before mounting TV on the wall. It is really hard to reach cable ports or get view of the text shown for ports. (I should have been a picture before hanging the TV, So I would recommend everyone to take a picture or else install all the cables before hanging the TV to the mount).Now the actual trouble starts, once TV was hanged I was unable to see the back of the TV and had tough time adding cables. When you tilt TV upward to add cables and to do this bottom screws of hanger need to be unscrewed to some extent and its hard to get to these screws due to minimum access and after tilting TV upward it just hangs on the top hook of the hangers (I was always worrying of TV may fall down any time). But I managed to add 2 HDMI cables to side ports and plan to add remaining cables when I take off the TV some time in future. But it will be impossible to tighten the bottom screws of the hangers, may be I need long long screw driver to reach it.So would like to give a 2 star overall.Pros:TV sticks very close to the wall.Sturdy frame for the price I paid ($30).Cons:Design should be improved to get the access to cable ports and bottom screws of the hangers.Improvement need on tilt functionality.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R3JFSACFF3FTP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Arrived quickly and should perform as needed.

A stud finder is a must!You will need a small ratchet to assemble the frame (8mm socket, if memory serves) along with a phillips screwdriver. The brackets that bolt to the back of the TV can adjust for up to 15 degrees of tilt, but the screws were ridiculously tight out of the package.You will need a drill with different bit sizes to drill into the studs for the included bolts, along with a larger socket set to bolt them securely to the wall.After the frame is mounted, the brackets on the TV allow you to simply lift and hook it over the wall frame. Even once the TV is up, it is easy to adjust it to the left or right a bit to center if you are slightly off.The final unit is very low profile against the wall.

I bought two of these for two different brand TV's. The TV's, weighing from 40 to 70 lbs, are easily held up by these mounts. I even did a 'hanging test' by hanging on to the mounts before hanging the TV's. I weigh a little over 200 lbs and the mounts didn't budge. Of course, the weight limit is around 165 lbs so I wouldn't hang anything above the recommended limit but it was reassuring to do a simple hanging test. Installation took around 30 minutes. As long as you locate the wall studs and know exactly where you are mounting the TV ahead of time you shouldn't have a problem. Absolutely make sure the mount goes in to at least one stud for plenty of support. The only small complaint I do have about this product is after the TV is mounted, the 2 secure screws underneath of the mount that prevent an individual from pulling the bottom of the TV out are a little tough to reach. You would need a rather long screw driver to reach them. That being said, I still give this product 5 stars because it truly is a great TV mount and is universal for just about any brand and model.

All the mounting hardware is included (as is a 10 foot HDMI cable and a bubble level).  This is the second TV I have wall mounted, the first being over ten years ago when the process was a lot more difficult and when TV's were a lot heavier.  This was a much easier mounting process that required only minimal mechanical skill and tools, although I would still suggest having a partner.This is also a VESA mount.  VESA is an organization that provides uniformity standards for the different brands of consumer electronics to comply with, which as far as mounts go, means that most major TV brands will have similar mounting set-ups so the process and equipment used for mounting will be standard, or 'VESA compliant'.

I used it in my daughter's room for her new 42\" flat panel TV. The one I received had a slight manufacturing defect as one of the bolt holes was stripped. The one that was stripped was on the end where the vertical bracket ties into the horizontal brackets. Fortunately, I had the tools to repair it myself, so I did not have to send it back.The wall mount comes in 8 pieces plus the HDMI cable. I've installed many wall-mount brackets in my recent past.  That being said, this one took me just over an hour to assemble the wall bracket, mount the two hangers to the TV, and hang the TV. I've seen much better brackets out there, but they were also 5x the cost.One key note, you better have a really long phillips head screwdriver (more than 1' long) to tighten the two screws that lock the hangers to the wall-mount bracket. I could not physically get to the screws, so its just hanging on the top bracket. I'll be purchasing another bracket with better features & ergonomics. On the plus side, the wall-mount is very solid when bolted to the wall-studs and it comes with an assortment of hardware, most of which you wont need.***UPDATE***Cheetah Mounts Customer Care reached out to me via phone today and I must say, I was very impressed. After they saw my review and saw that my product was slightly defective, they offered to send me a new mount free of charge, which I declined as it wasn't necessary as I repaired the threads of the mount myself. In return, they refunded my purchase without asking for the now-working product back. With this type of customer service, I have upgraded my 2-star review to a 4-star review.

I helped a friend install the sanus version of this mount recently and I'm glad I went with Cheetah Mounts.This Mount comes in pieces. 6 for the backplate which are not that hard to assemble, and 2 brackets which attach to the TV. I was mounting an 80 pound TV and this thing is holding it up no problem. I used my own hardware to attach it to the wall so I don't know about the screws in that area but it is otherwise packaged with a lot of \"bits & pieces\", some of which you will not need. It was nice to know that they included these bits, this way you should be able to mount almost any TV.The only drawbacks I found are that once you get the TV on the mount, the securing screws in the back at the bottom of the mount are very hard to access. You will need a really long phillips screwdriver to get to those. The other thing is when trying to center the TV on the mount, the sliding action isn't very smooth. This is not such a big deal, once it's centered you'll probably never mess with it again. I only mention it because the sanus motion was much smoother, and it also had a better securing design in the back. It's also almost 3 times the price. I don't think the price difference is worth it.Overall I'm very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Wall Mount for my LG 42\" LED TV", "Author": "Tarish Aggarwal", "ReviewID": "R17D9HFEK12JUX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We sturdy and strong construction.

The instructions were somewhat vague as to how the pieces connected together, but once I figured that out, it was fairly simple.The only other issue I encountered was actually attaching the mount to the wall, due to the fact that my apartment has older plaster walls, not drywall. A word of warning: if you have plaster walls, you will likely have great difficulty in using a drill/driver and the included screws.

But the screws they use to hold the thing together are very small and VERY cheap.  One of the screws stripped the threads (they gotta be using the cheapest Chinese made screws possible) and I had to turn the thing 180 degrees because I was afraid it might not hold the weight.  Once on the wall it seemed sturdy but maybe 0.05$ more for better quality screws wouldn't be too much to ask.  Just be very careful when screwing the frame together or you might strip a couple and then you're going to the hardware store for more screws.  It was just unpleasant having to find a way to make sure the thing hung together with the 50 lb plasma on it.  Next time I'll buy elsewhere.So I need to update my review.  This company just called me (this is what, 6-8 hours after I posted my first review)  and they are sending me a replacement mount and it's better than the one I originally purchased.  They are also sending it two day shipping which was above and beyond if you ask me.  The women who helped me gave me the option of a full refund or a better mount.  She was very helpful and understanding. So I am going to change my review to five stars.  Really, when a company goes to the trouble of losing money to make me happy they deserve praise.  There is good customer service and then there is the customer service I experienced with these guys.  If this is what you can expect from this company than I can't recommend them enough.  By the way, I was able to get this mount up and working and it does sit really close to the wall so if that is what you want then go with this one.  It does leave enough room so that you don't need the 90 degree angle adapter.

You can adjust the brackets before mounting the TV, but it's very difficult to ensure the two arms are parallel. I use them in the flat configuration, so this wasn't an inconvenience.

Too good to be true, right? Well, no. The replacement was received a day earlier than Heather promised. I can't believe it. How many manufacturers/sellers will do this. I installed the new mount soon as I got back from vacation. I am very happy with it. It not only recesses into the wall but it also tilts up and down and left to right. It is very easy now to connect and/or disconnect every sort of cords needed to take full advantage of my 1.5 inches thick 60 inches digital TV. The mount is easy to work with as it is a lot lighter than other mounts I looked at at local stores. The lock screws as well as the tilt lock are very accessible. The price almost sent me into shock.... FREE as promised including S/H. Unbelievable service. I highly recommend this seller and this mount. THANK YOU THANK YOU for making this customer happy. I WILL GIVE THE PRODUCT A 5 STAR only because 5 is the max allowed.P.S.  Assembly and mounting can be done by one person easily. Oh, and the replaced mount need not be returned.

I'm kicking myself for not putting my TV on the mount sooner!The mount was fairly easy to set up and is extremely lightweight. I haven't tested the HDMI cable at this point, so I cannot speak for the quality of it, but it does look nice! My television sets as flush to the wall as it possibly can and boy does it look sexy! This mount ROCKS.Notes about installation:The illustrations aren't really that great; IKEA has better illustrations. The SIDE brackets do NOT go over the top/bottom brackets, but rather INSIDE the brackets and then it screws together; if you try to slide the side brackets over the top/bottom brackets, your screw holes will NOT line up.The security screws (after you mount the TV) are a pain in the butt to tighten. I had to go to my local hardware store and purchase an extremely skinny 10\" flathead screwdriver to reach up behind the TV to tighten the screws.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this mount and the time it took to install it.

Rutledge", "ReviewID": "RVQ0WDGTXEHE4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've worked off and on in home theater stuff (Best Buy installs, A/V industry recently) going back to 2006. I've seen many, many, many kinds of mounts. There is (or was) at least a 70% markup in stores for what you got, but it still felt like you got something substantial for it.True, those mounts would probably bring down the wall before they broke, but it's a nice feeling of security. When I got this Cheetah mount I was shocked to say the least. The box is tiny. The pieces are thin and bendable by hand. Despite the reviews my doubts started to grow.If you feel this way too when you get it don't worry too much. This really is a clever design to make something function as cheaply to manufacture as possible. There is nothing wrong with that for this because it just has to work (there is no fundamental \"this one works better\" for a flat wall mount). All it is doing is transferring the weight of the TV to the wall and is reinforced exactly where it is needed and nowhere else. I put up a 47\" LCD up which wasn't the lightest model you can get these days but I had no real concerns once it was on.It's pretty close to the wall so the tilt will be limited to how large your tv is before it hits the wall. If you need a lot of tilt I'm sure there are better options. The plastic level that came with it actually worked great for me but it is very cheap.My advice to anyone is make sure you screw in everything perfectly and predrill your holes exactly. There isn't a lot of leeway for error.I'm only giving it 4 stars because despite everything, I'd much rather pay $5 more dollars and getting rid of the HDMI cable for a slightly sturdier product. It really does seem like it's cutting it close. But like I said, that's all you really need.

The document is actually well put together and each piece is assigned a letter in the diagrams; but none of the pieces actually have the letters on them.  Each piece comes in a bag, and neither the piece nor the bag contains a label.  This isn't such a big deal though.The second challenge was with the parts.  Out of the box, one washer was broken, and I somehow cracked and broke 2 others during the install.  I also managed to mess up a screw.  I'm not sure what materials the parts are made out of, but do use caution if using power tools.  The bad part of all this is that no spares are really included.  Luckily I had extra washers/screws I could use from past furniture purchases.Overall, I do not regret the purchase, and in fact really do like the wall mount.  I would just suggest being careful assembling it since the parts aren't labeled and that you be cautious in not over-tightening parts if using power tools.An HDMI cable is also included, making this even a better deal, and the included levels really help!!02/18/2014 Update:I just wanted to post that Cheetah Mounts provides exceptional customer service.

It does the job without worry.  It allow for some vertical tilt.It does not give you much room to get to inputs and such when TV is mounted, especially is you're a male with decent sized or large hands.  Thankfully, I actually screwed a two 30\" 2x4 to the studs first and then attached the mount to the top 2x4.  This gave me the ability to mount the mount as needed to the 2x4s without respect to where the studs were.  The bottom 2x4 serves as a rest point for TV without having too much tilt.  Even with this setup that gives me an additional near 2 inches of room to work with behind the TV to connect to inputs, I still struggle to get to them.  I can only imagine if the 2x4 was not there.  I would probably have to remove the TV to add inputs.  This would make swapping or connecting to inputs a two person job.

It seems like it will hold. The brackets that connect your TV to the mount are flimsy. Trying to center my TV bent those way too easily. Hopefully they fix that in the future. A nice lady from Cheetah mounts contacted me. She was very concerned about my comments on the mount, and asked me a few questions about it. I answered them, and she was able to \"rectify\" the situation. I spent more time than I should have installing this mount, and had to do some things to make it work in my situation. Let's just say, I'm satisfied with how Cheetah Mounts handled this. Their costumer service is much better than most others I have experienced. I will buy from them again. The best I can give is 3*s, and it's mostly for the customer service, had to -2* for the flimsy mount.*Original Review:Significantly not as pictured. The arms that hold the tv to the mount are not as pictured. They are much thinner, and have many \"cheetah\" holes in them. They bend extremely easy while trying to center your tv. The levels that come with the mount are almost worthless. The \"built in level\" is no longer built in, and you are not able to place it in the center of the mount due to its horrible new design. Luckily I have a 4' level, and that's how I was able to get this mount on the wall properly. The mount itself gets 1*, I added another * for the hdmi cord. I have 2 other cheetah mounts in my house, and they are great, but I can not recommend this one. I'm more than likely going to replace it with a higher quality mount because I do not have much faith in this one. It says it can hold 165lbs, I have a 60\" Sharp Aquos that weighs maybe 65lbs, and I don't trust it.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing Product", "Author": "Allen P.

The included HDMI cable was a nice bonus, too, especially considering how reasonable the price was to begin with.  Plus, even though the instructions assume that your TV will have come with the correct mounting screws, they provide a comprehensive assortment of them anyway.

They are kind of hard to get to, but not so bad that I would deduct any stars from my review.

Mounts at major retailers are $50+ and being a former retail employee I know the margin is HUGE on these items.  The added HDMI cable and level weren't a selling point but a great bonus and since I don't own a level I was happy to have that added confidence when installing the mount.The mount itself is fairly simple to put together, if you have ever played with Legos you probably figured it out sooner than people who have not and decided to read the instructions (meaning the pieces fit together a certain way perfectly).  The biggest trouble I had was with applying the brackets to the TV.  The screw was the right size but was too long and the brackets shifted back and forth on the screws.  I went to home depot and purchased nuts to supplement the gap in the screws.Update: Cheetah reached out to me and apologized for the inconvenience for the screw size and offered me a make good.

I wanted little to no noticable gap with the ability to tilt forward. This was perfect for this kind of application and the cost was hands done perfect.The only negative design aspect I found was the overall length of the assembly. For instance if your wall studs are not positioned pretty close to the mounting area you may have not achieve true center due the rail length. If you notice from the picture there is limited left to right movement before you hit the stops on the top rail. So in short if you have to shift the mount to the right or left some in order to hit the wall studs you may not be able to slide the TV far enough down the top rail to position it where you want. In my opinion on my 50\" TV I had plenty of room for a larger bracket that would allowed for a longer rail system. This mount would not be a good fit in that case - but for me I was lucky on the wall stud position.

Hide the cables well and you have a sexy install.6) Very reasonably priced without being super cheap garbage.There is only one design element that keeps this from 5 stars:1)  The biggest issue is that main frame that mounts on the back wall is in 8 pieces.  The top piece and bottom piece of the frame are NOT a single piece of metal.  It's three pieces of metal that bolt together to make a single piece.  There are two drawbacks with this design.  a) It took an extra hour to figure it all out.  Instructions weren't as clear as I'd have liked.  b)  My best stud to use was dead center.  However, look at the picture, the bracket as a good 6-8\" in the center where you cannot mount to a stud because of the three piece design.  I'd have rather paid a few more dollars for single piece of metal along the top and a single piece of metal along the bottom with stud mounting holes available in the dead center of the bracket.I was able to accommodate the design by mounting the entire bracket off center and then hanging the TV on the side.  Given its a 60\" and I had exactly 64\" to mount the TV between two windows, nobody can tell the bracket is off center.  The TV hides this fact.  The TV is very stable as well.  I would have preferred to use 3 studs and kept it centered but it just wasn't going to work out.This is petty but the teal HDMI cable is ugly.  I kept in the drawer for a backup cable or a loaner cable.  You buy a slick mount like this to keep things looking sexy.Ultimately, I would buy another one for my next TV install.

It was so tight that I thought I was doing something wrong.  I finally got it loosened enough to tilt and installed on the back of my tv.  Unfortunately I tightened it back up.  When I hung it up it looked great, but when I went to tighten the security screws the little piece of metal wasn't under the bottom bracket like it should be.  It was hitting it.  Apparently I tilted it too much, which I didn't think was possible.  So I took the tv down and readjusted the tilt and hung back up and it fit on to where I could tighten the security screws correctly.  Although it takes a long screwdriver.  Then was able to adjust the tilt and tighten the tilt screw a little.  I feel confident that my new tv won't fall.  My advice, when you are adjusting the tilt screws before installing on your tv, hang them up to make sure you haven't tilted it too far.  You wouldn't think that is possible, but it is.  It was just a little too far.  I still think it would have held, but didn't want to take the chance with my kids getting smashed under the tv.

Our flat panel is 55\", about 60 lbs, easily within specs for this bracket. Hardest part is finding the studs - used both a magnetic and another borrowed finder. It comes with many packets of potential hardware you might need. However, the 6mm screws for mounting the TV itself to the vertical support arms were too long. The ones needed for the Sony were spec'd to be 8 to 12mm; too dangerous to put a longer screw in because it might hit something!I'm not certain about how the tilt would work, it seems like the top and bottom screws thru the vertical supports into the TV back want to clamp the vertical supports parallel to the back of the TV, but if the supports are angled about a bolt near the center, it would seem like the angle would be fighting against the screws clamping against the TV, perhaps trying to deform the metal of the TV. Decided not to tilt and avoid the issue.There are two \"safety\" screws at the bottom of the vertical supports that should be screwed upwards to capture the flange on the bottom horizontal rib mounted on the wall so the TV cannot swing outwards at the bottom. These are difficult to get to once the TV is hung from the top horizontal rib, and you can't swing out the bottom for easy access to screw in the screws because then they will not catch behind the bottom flange. Not a problem, we don't have kids around.Very good quality for the price; I would recommend it to anybody with TV's in the specified sizes.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works, but it is not great.

The problem is that the metal is thin and somewhat flimsy (especially the arm brackets which attach to the TV), and there are quality control issues. For example, three of the screws would not screw in. Fortunately I have a metric tap and die set, and I was able to re-tap the holes. These screws were not integral design by which the TV hangs, so I wasn't too worried about screw holding as strongly  as they should have (cross bracket screws, and safety screw).The included torpedo level was useless. Throw it away. You can check the accuracy by flipping it 180 degrees and making sure the bubble still lines up in the same place.Use your own level, which you should have if you are undertaking projects like this one. I don't know if the HDMI cable is any good. I would have rather they spent money on their steel and not the HDMI cable (which I am sure most of us have in great numbers).Finally, once you have hung the TV, it is impossible to get at the adjustment screws with a regular length Phillips screwdriver. I ordered a TEKTON 2773 20-Inch by #2 Phillips Extra Long Screwdriver on Amazon (hopefully no earthquakes in the meantime). From the reviews for that screwdriver, apparently this is a common problem with these cheaper TV mounts. Also, the pictures show a T-handled adjustment screw. Mine had a regular Phillips head screw. I guess nobody has hands thin enough to reach in between the TV set and wall to adjust the screws.Overall, the TV mount works, but if you don't have handyman or other previous experience, I can see this mount being set up poorly. I definitely would not try to adjust the TV tilt angle frequently, as I don't think this mount was designed for such use.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Something you should know before installing", "Author": "Everstar \"WonderWoman\"", "ReviewID": "R1TMWPQ388BGU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Price was great, the HDMI cable it comes with is good quality (I have two of them at work), and it's convenient that you get a level with it. All parts included, instructions were clear and in English, quick installation (less than 30 minutes).Cons: I wanted to bolt this into the studs to make sure it had a good strong hold, problem is, the studs aren't always exactly where you would want them, so the bolt on one side was a few inches in from the edge. After hanging the 47\" Vizio, the side that didn't have a bolt on the edge pulled out and down, un-leveling the TV horribly. I had to add a drywall screw on the very edge to hold it back up, which isn't a big deal, but would have been nice to know before mounting it.The other star is because the \"safety screws\" are really a pain to screw/unscrew.Overall, it's a good value for the price. I will probably get another one when I get another TV because I have already discovered those little tricks that will make for a better installation.EDIT: The customer service for Cheetah Mounts contacted me and has really gone above and beyond any expectations I had, to make sure I was satisfied with the product - which I am... you just need to know that wherever you put the mounting bolts, you MUST also have some bolts on the outermost placement for a bolt to keep the mount against the wall so it doesn't bend out.

Once the TV is mounted there are two \"safety\" screws at the bottom that will essentially lock the TV to the bracket.  These screws are a bit tricky to get to and will require a long phillips head screwdriver to get to, but by no means is it impossible.  By far this was the most tricky part of the install.For my purposes this was a great mount.  All the hardware was included.  It holds my TV securely and sturdily to my wall with a very low profile.

Both installs went without much problems and the problems that I did encounter were not because of the mounting hardware. Before you mount your television though, make sure that you plan ahead. Keep in mind that this mount will place your TV very close to the wall so if you have inputs in the back of the television then it's going to be very difficult to reach them once the TV is mounted and secured. Plan on extending those ports somehow with male-to-female cables or using audio/video wall plates and installing all of the cable before finalizing your mounting install. Additionally, I used my own leveler combined with the included (smaller) leveler from this Cheetah product, just to make sure everything was leveled properly. I did not use the other (larger) level that was included so I cannot speak on the quality of that item. You should also purchase, or borrow, a long phillips screwdriver (I had a 22\" long screwdriver on hand). The long screwdriver will be needed to secure the TV to the mount and adjust the tilt.

I've set it up twice now after having moved homes.  The only things I'm deducting a star for are that it doesn't quite tilt far enough and the set screws are very difficult to reach without a very long screwdriver (12\"+).  I was able to get the angle I need for my family room, but this shortens the distance between the top and bottom hooks on the arms (the two arms attach to the back of your TV and the top hook on each arm are what hang from the wall-mounted portion).  Normally (at tilt degrees less than 15), the hooks on the bottom of the arms reach past the lip on the bottom of the wall mount and then you tighten the set screw to prevent them from coming back over the lip.  But when you tilt past 15 degrees, the bottom hooks don't reach far enough down to get over the bottom lip, so I can't secure everything with the set screws.  I'll have to figure out another way to secure the TV before I have kids, but at this time, the weight of the TV does a pretty good job of keeping everything in place and secure enough.I really like the braided casing on the HDMI cable.

A few weeks after I bought it the company contacted me about the experience I had with the mount and why I gave it a neutral review. I explained to them a few things about the product and they offered to send me a free shelving unit for my troubles.

The TV was to be mounted about a fire place. I did a lot of research and spent a lot of time looking for a good mount.

I looked into mounts on Amazon when I bought an Amazon Prime account. Went back and forth looking at reviews for Cheetah and VideoSecu mounts and ultimately decided on the Cheetah mount based off of good reviews and reasonable installation.Got my mount through UPS in 2 days and was a little concerned when I looked at how small the packaging was. Once I unboxed everything and laid it out, I wasn't as concerned. The material seems sturdy and everything that was supposed to be in the box, was in the box. I've seen some people complain about how vague the directions are, I didn't find them very difficult to figure out. I built the plate that mounts to the wall first, installed the mounting brackets on the TV, secured the back plate to studs separated by 24\", hung the TV, and adjusted where it sat so it was centered.Super-easy installation. Took my all of 20 minutes to get it done. My only suggestion is to use your own level. The level that came with the mount was not 100% accurate.

I went ahead with my purchase figuring if it didn't pass my quality control I would return it.  Once I received it I spent some time going over the contents making sure nothing was missing, and verifying the assembly instructions.  At this point I had to remove the brackets used to connect butt connect the support bars as they would never create a level line as they arrived.  After getting that reassembled, I then was able to complete the assembly of the wall bracket.The instructions call for using metric drill bits, which I didn't have.  A quick google search got me the fraction equivalents and I was off to the races.Using a quality stud finder I located two studs and drilled the required holes in them (the upper holes are a different size then the lower holes, so pay attention here).  I the attached the bracket to the wall and was happy with the mount.  It provided enough room to securely mount to two studs and I was able to have it in the position that I wanted the tv to be without any issues.  I then mounted the brackets to the tv, using the hardware provided, and attached the tv to the mount.  This was a two person operation due to the size, so make sure you have an extra set of hands for this step.  The mounts have enough holes in them that I was able to adjust the height of the tv to be exactly where I wanted it.In all the whole process took me 2 hours to assemble, level, and mount.I was not missing any hardware in my package, and the metal brackets were not damaged in my package, so other then having to take the time to fix the butt connection bracket, and having to take the time to verify drill bit sizes ( remember when substituting drill bits, always go smaller) this is a great product and I couldn't be happier with it.  I have already committed my self to helping my neighbor install one for his tv after he helped me with mine.Note: I did not use the supplied level or hdmi cable.EDIT - 1/17/2014I am updating my review of this product after talking with a staff member at Cheetah (as you can see in the comment they reached out to me based on my review).  My original review of this product was 4 stars.  After talking with them, and going over the issues I had with the product that resulted in me not giving it 4 stars, they let me know that they valued my feed back and would like to extend to me an offer of either a partial refund, or a second unit of the product.  As I am very happy with the unit I received, I didn't feel that they needed to provide either of these to me, but I decided to take them up on the offer of a second unit, so that I could take a second look at the product.  They quickly shipped out the second unit, and all I can say is that I was even more impressed by what I saw in this new unit then I was to begin with.  They have upgraded the packaging of the unit, and the parts seem to aligned properly straight out of the box.  Instructions are the same as far as I can tell (I didn't keep the original ones to compare against).

Great customer service and very impressive attention to a upset client. Well done .Original Review:This mount sags bad and I mean bad, truly unsafe....That's major problem number 1. ( I was way under the weight and size listed as the max)Major Problem 2: The wall plate is 17.5 inches wide compared to all other mounts wall plates which are much wider (which allow for some adjustment side to side (sliding) on the wall plate, to \"center the tv\" etc.) - if your stud work is off center from we're you want tv, then your tv is off center- there is no way to adjust trust me I tried.Simply put DO NOT BUY.... (I truly can't believe the good ratings, it's actually concerning- maybe those TVs were tiny?) if I could give no stars I wouldAmazon prime returns? ....

The customer service representative seemed genuinely interested in my feedback and explained that Cheetah had switched to a four-piece horizontal bar set instead of a two-piece set in order to conform the box to Amazon Prime's shipping requirements.  Because of my partial dissatisfaction with the assembly process, the customer service rep reimbursed my purchase $10.

This mount is so flush to the wall that I could not use standard HDMI or component cable plus because the backshells were longer than the available spacing.

I feel it is adequate, but I think it is easier to make mistakes with this than with other TV mounts I have used.It is composed of two horizontal bars of heavier metal that are joined by two vertical bars of flimsier metal. Once bolted to the wall it rests quite securely. My issue is with the brackets joined to the TV. The twin hooks on each bracket that mount to the bar don't line up with each other perfectly. There are four of these hooks with two on each bracket. On a single bracket, one hook might engage the wall mount and the other might not be engaged. I had to try a few times to get all four hooks engaged on the wall mount. Also, I used this for a 60 inch TV and while this is low profile, it can be a challenge to see behind the TV to be sure they are all engaged. The second issue I have is the security screw to prevent accidentally removing the TV. I had a hard time tightening this as it is too high behind the TV and with my hand behind the TV I could not tighten this well even with a long screwdriver.

Upon receiving the mount everything looked great.  Once I started to put it together though, I began to regret my purchase.  The vertical braces for the mount are held together with small screws.  One of the screw holes for my mount was drilled too small for the provided hardware and would not hold the braces tight... Still jiggled.  This gave me an uneasy feeling with it not being solidly held together, so I ran to home depot and got some 3/8 length 10 32 bolts and a couple nylon locking nuts and used those on the 4 corners to hold the braces together instead.  Once the mount was assembled, I went to put it on the wall.  Got everything lined up and level and started to torque down the lag bolts into the studs.  I didn't even torque one of the bolts down fully and it ended up shearing off leaving me with just the bolt head falling out into my hands.  Another trip to home depot and I had 4 galvanized lag bolts, some remeasuring and leveling later I got the mount bolted to the wall.  One of the braces that attached to the back of the TV was stuck in the no tilt position.  I donty plan on tilting my TV, so this wasn't a big deal.  When it came time to screw in the safeties, only one of the holes was drilled properly.

However he had lots and lots of problem.  After he sent me his pictures, I realized that vendor is shipping two different products under the same same product SKU.  Here is the picture of what I had.  Notice how there are three fasteners holding the horizontal component to the center piece  [...]HOWEVER, this is how it looks like when my brother got his mount.  Notice only two fasteners.  He had trouble with all of the hardware and in general he was very unhappy with the mount.  [...]If you get what I got, you would be OK but if you get what my brother got, you would have problems.  I am knocking it down by another star.---------------The only reason I knocked down a star because tilt adjustment or the safety screw tightening needs unusually large screw driver *AND* included levels are completely and utterly junk.  They are *NOT* level.  You need to throw them away and you use your regular 3-feet level or buy one.  Another reason I put this as 4-star instead of 5-star is because the instructions to connect the vertical pieces could have been better.  I was trying to hook them up as I thought there was a slot for the piece.  On the plus side, there was a phone number in the included English (!) directions (well done!) and I was able to talk with a real live customer service on 3rd ring.  While trying to explain my problem, I realized myself how to attach it correctly.  This part of the instruction could use some re-wording and a exploded picture showing it would be tremendous help.Something else to keep in mind is that it is low profile mount and once TV is installed, you barely have room to put a finger or two behind it.  So make sure all the cables are pre-hooked before putting the TV up.  As a matter of fact, if there are any connections in the back (versus on the side) put cables in there even if you are not using them now.  Leave the other end tucked up somewhere on the side, so you can hook them up later.  I installed my 55 inch LG LCD TV right over the gas fire place.People who are having trouble with this are the ones 1) who thought the levels were level 2) did not tighten everything down, 3) did not realize how low-profile this mount is.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good wall mount.", "Author": "Capri Hutchens", "ReviewID": "R3JGRH9QU6E2FL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a little tight to get cords into the back of the tv once the mount is on the wall, but loved how cheap and good quality it is at the same time.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "Printed Concept", "ReviewID": "R2OU3VWUV6X3D9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to install and fit perfectly for my 50in tv.

It is a low profile mount that does not protrude out of the wall too much. It looks almost hidden because of how thing it is.2. Despite being thin, this mount is very stable and does not feel flimsy at all.3. Security is probably the most important quality when it comes to wall mounts. Ultimately, you do not want a mount that makes you worry and nervous about falling off.4. The mount was also simple to install. The picture instructions were not complicated nor was the actual installation. The only time-consuming step was finding the studs with my old/malfunctioning stud finder; however, this step is irrelevant to the actual product and the ease of installation is not based on my malfunctioning tools.5. For $25, it is well worth it. I believe the price gone up a bit from when I bought mine, but it is still affordable. Don't be skeptical about the quality because of the price. The price is fair in my opinion, as it does not create a dent in my wallet nor do I feel ripped off.Cons:My biggest problem with this is the lack of flexibility with the tilt. The tilt is not designed very well in the sense that your cords need to be plugged into the back of your TV. The tilt leaves little room for your arm to reach through and plug the cords.This is actually very inconvenient for me because my 40 inch Sony TV was from 2009, so it is bulkier than most Flat Panel TVs nowadays. Because of this, it is very difficult for me to to plug in all my cords (HDMI, aux, etc.). The mount is simple and only serves to mount the TV to the wall, so if you like a mount that can tilt frequently/easily, this is not the mount for you. This is my only problem with the mount, and why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.My advice:1. Plan ahead and see how you are going to plug your cords to your TV. If you have your inputs on the back, make sure to plug the cords first before mounting it.2. Make sure if you want a flexible/swiveling mount or a simple mount. This is a simple mount and should be purchased if you do not need to plug/unplug cords too often.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good buy as long as your TV will work with it", "Author": "Mark Barker", "ReviewID": "R31RKIDX07XBRA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this wall mount to use with a Sony KDL60R550 LCD TV.

So I am left with an openend package for this bracket that I cannot use and had to order a bracket with more clearance.  I don't blame the bracket other than there were no indicators that this may be a problem on this model of Sony TV (which is why the 4 starts and not 5).

HOWEVER, the LG I bought has integrated speakers that are \"down firing\" in the base and the bottom is approximately 3/4 of an inch wider than anywhere else on the TV.  So, after I placed the TV on the wall, because the bottom speaker was slightly larger, I could not get to the safety screw of the mount.  So, the TV is hanging, but, the safety screws are not tightened.  You can't ever so slightly pull the TV from the wall either or the screws will not line up.  Does it work? Yes.  But, if you have kids (which I don't), or live in an earthquake area (which I don't), you may not want to use this with certain LG TV's.It's is sturdy, it does include a long HDMI cable and a level.  The value is great, the construction is good.  I would recommend this.  Just heed my advise if using an LG TV.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works and looks great", "Author": "blainebassett", "ReviewID": "R2SWZVT5T3AT9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exactly as advertised and works flawlessly great, easy installation.

What makes them affordable are the fact that they're modular. While this keeps the cost down, it does have some drawbacks, especially with older, bulkier flat panels.Some minor issues I experienced:- Because the corners are screwed together, it's easy to knock the whole mount out of square. Be careful after it's assembled. Resist the urge to tweak the squareness by pushing on the corners. I did this and almost made it worse.- With 16\" stud centers, this mount's center can be thrown off quite a bit. It left one end sort of \"dangling\" on my installation. With the hangers on the TV pushed nearly to the ends of the bracket's width, that dangling end wanted to droop with the weight of my TV on it. I had to compensate by loosening the bracket and shifting the lesser supported end upward (and out of level) to get the finished installation perfectly level (leveling off of the TV).- My set is an older Panasonic TH-50PZ700U and the bottom end of this sucker is FAT (about 4.5\" to 5\"). Because of the thickness, the bottom of the set is against the wall and the maximum tilt is looking more like 5-7 degrees. This also makes it impossible to lock the set onto the bracket.- Panasonic puts the weight of this old set at almost 106 pounds. While I believe the weight rating on the mount, my set seemed to be giving it a workout.- Metric lags suck. Why? Because I don't own many metric tools! A cordless impact is my preferred tool of choice for a job like this and I don't own any metric nut drivers.

I ruined two of my HDMI cables in the attempt to get this to work. I did give this product a fair day in court, and this is my very first review. I felt so cheated by my investment of time and labor in this project I wish to vehemently warn off any other potential victims. This is most definitely poor design and not in the least a universal mount. As for the high grade steel claim on the front of the box, let me ask you, have you ever tightened a nut and had the head of the bolt pop off? This actually happened and is testament to the cheap Chinese steel this mount is composed of. Quite a collection of bolts and washers are included, but the 8 to 12 mm screws necessary for the mounting of the hooks to the back of my Sony Bravia were not.

I would recommend looking into flush mount electrical outlets and units to handle the audio/video depending on how you will be running your cables. I had an outlet close the floor below where I was hanging the TV. I was able to add a flush mount electrical unit behind the TV that also had a cutout for the audio/video cables. I have wiring experience so took power off the unit close to the floor. Dropped the audio/video cables back through the wall and ran them to the devices going to the TV.

I managed to install it and hang a 75-lb Sharp LC-46D64U (46\", late 2007) by myself (which required true feats of strength).  I'm very careful with reading instructions, assembly, measuring and leveling -- which took me three attempts of hanging, checking levelness, removing, and adjusting -- so it took me over an hour to assemble and hang the TV.Assembling the mounting bracket from six separate pieces was a little annoying, but not a huge deal.  When you consider that each bracket is secured by a separate bolt, it doesn't really matter that each of them is a separate piece, although the bottom bracket isn't going to provide a lot of support (if any), since nothing is hanging on it.  (This is where a one-piece design would have been nice, but it's probably why the lower bolts were reduced in size as someone else alluded in his review.)I found the included level to to be inaccurate and used my own instead.  I didn't bother using the tiny bubble level, although it was included.I was impressed with the array of extra hardware provided for securing the hangers on the back of my TV.  There were spacers and bolts that were a perfect match for the bolt holes in the rear of my TV.  (The spacers were necessary, because the holes in the TV were not as deep as the included bolts are long.)As others have mentioned, getting to the safety screws with anything approaching max incline is rather difficult.  I managed to piece together enough extensions (quick lock, two extenders, and a long Phillips head driver on a manual screw driver handle) to reach the safety screws in the back, although it wasn't easy.  It won't be fun if I ever take down the TV ...  If this is too daunting for you, I recommend buying a mount that tilts left-to-right (not just up and down) to afford easier access.It's been up a week and so far everything is secure.  The lag bolts felt sturdy, an each one is in a stud.  The brackets didn't budget after I secured them to the wall.  There's plenty of room for running cables behind, although I elected not to do that at this time.  The description says it's rated to 165 lbs (which is why I feel pretty comfortable hanging my 75-lb unit), although I don't think I'd test that.  I feel uneasy as it is with my 75-lb TV set, but it held.  I wouldn't have any qualms at all about hanging a 40-lb TV, which is probably what a 50\" is going to be nowadays.If you're looking to save money, don't mind some extra assembly, and can deal with difficult-to-reach safety screws in the back, then I recommend this TV mount.

As long as it's attached to studs it should be good to go.  Be aware, though, that there are different size bolts.  Of the four total that are needed, the two in the top are the same size, and the two in the bottom are the same size, but different from the two in the top.

You want it to look straight, not actually be straight - two completely different things when it comes to homes.  Take it from years of hanging things on the wall.Another tip, if you want to screw in the safety screws after the tv is on the mount, you'll need a 16-20 inch long philips screw driver to reach up behind the tv.

Cheetah customer service reached out to me (see their comment below) on my original review (see below).  I appreciate a company that believes in customer service, and definitely have to give them applause.  Especially since we aren't talking about a multi-hundred dollar purchase, but rather a sub $30 wall-mount.Per Cheetah's request, I contacted them and have a great chat and vented the frustrations that I had.  The 60\" TV I have is properly wall mounted -- I'm happy with the mount.  But, as I explained to the customer service rep, while this is a good product, and while it's \"rated\" up to a 65\" TV, it (and probably most other slim wall mounts) really aren't \"good\" on large screens.So, I've bumped-up my rating from 2-stars to 4-stars.  -3 because it was an absolute NIGHTMARE to install on my 60\" screen.  +1 because the price was great (which pushed it up from 1* to 2* originally), another +1 because of the great, pro-active customer service, and another +1 because it is a good mount (for smaller TV's) and, if I were going to do say a 40\", I'd gladly buy this same mount.-----I'm torn on what to rate this.While the price was cheap, and it came with an HDMI cable and a level, it's a case of you get what you pay for.Used it to mount a 60\" LED TV to the wall.  You have to first put the wall mount together (simple enough, but does make me question just how sturdy the thing really is).Aside from sturdiness (it is rated to 100+ lbs, so my 70# tv *should* be OK), but there are two *BIG* negatives of this over a wall mount I used for my other TV.1) Due to it being a low(er) profile mount, it's VERY DIFFICULT to get the safety screws screwed into the back.

Only problem is that most if not all tv mounts are based on 16\" center 2x4's instead of 24\" centers like most houses are. This results in only being able to screw on one end of the mount and toward the middle of the mount.  This caused my tv to not be in the middle of my wall.  The mount itself is only 29\" wide so I needed a few more inches. For my 55\" tv in the living room, this didn't work because of how wide the wall was.

I also had trouble trying to figure out how to get my TV up on the rack securely, at the 15 degree angle setting, only the top clamps slid onto the bracket so it was just hanging there. I spent most of the installation time balanced on my tiptoes with the TV in my arms. Quite precarious, considering I lack any upper-body strength. I ended up needing to leave it set at no angle (straight vertical), then take out the tilt-adjust bolts once it was mounted properly so that I could tilt it down to 15 degrees, then put the bolts back in.

Looks like there's hardly anything at all behind the TV  - The HDMI cable is a nice bonusCons:  - I found the levels, both the one you can attach to the mount during installation as well as the standalone unit, to be incorrect.  YMMV.  - Possibly a little too thin?  Some of my cables get pinched against the wall behind the TV (I bought a right-angle HDMI adapter to help with this); also there's no way to tighten the little screws at the bottom of the mounting arms that \"secure\" the mountAll in all, very happy with this mount, especially for the price.

It would be nice if it held it a little bit further from the wall so we could install that. As it is, we rely on strategically place furniture to keep people from walking close to or under the tv and thus reduce the risk of it falling off.Update 11/10/2013After posting the above review, the manufacturer (Cheetah) contacted me to find out more about the issue I reported above. It turns out that the issue is that I ordered a mount that was too slim for my model of TV and I needed the APDAM2 model which was significantly more expensive. Even though this was my mistake, Cheetah sent me the correct model at no charge (2nd Day Air) and said that I could even keep the original model that I had ordered.I received the replacement mount within two days and installed with no issue. The new mount was very easy to install - even easier than the original mount even though it was physically larger. Unlike the original model I had ordered, this model comes with a scissor type mechanism that allows the TV to be pulled away from the wall and pivoted up to 130 deg and 15 deg tilt. This allows for easy access to the rear of the TV (big plus!). The mechanism collapses down to be very compact - not bulky at all.TL;DR - Cheetah contacted me after seeing my original review.

The wall I was mounting on (in between two doors) had three studs (~25%, ~50%, ~75%).  Naturally, I want to center the TV, and the closer you can center the mount on the wall, the better off you are.  Which leads to...#1) There are no mounting holes close to the center of the bracket.  I refuse to use wall anchors and want the bracket to span two studs.  But in order to do that, I had to put the mount 2-3\" off to one side or the other.  Because of where the arms mount on the TV, when I put the TV up, I need to slide it all the way to one end of the bracket to get it CLOSE to center, but I'm still off by ~1-2\".  It wouldn't be noticeable on a large wall, but the TV just fits between these two doors, so it is noticeable.#2) I had a hard time increasing the angle on the arms (tried to do it before putting the TV on the wall.  I finally successfully got one arm to be at an angle, but couldn't get the other one.As I said, the mount does it's job and was pretty easy to put up, but I'll probably look for a different mount in the future (although it will be a while before I need another one).It was a bonus to get an HDMI cable.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "This thing is strong", "Author": "DC", "ReviewID": "R2ES0UZQN9ZEV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We could have hung 200 lbs on this thing.

The first package never reached me and Amazon refunded in 3 days. I re-ordered the same item, this time it reached me fine.Pros:Simplistic, elegant design.SturdyEasy to assembleComes with all the bolts, screws, washers and spacers you'll need, and more.Cons:HDMI Cable isnt small profile, if ur TV is thick (Plasma/LCD), the HDMI cable will push the TV slightly forward if the ports are at the back. May need to buy a right angle adapter.Flaws:The angular tilt on both arms are difficult to get right without a protractor. Why is this critical - If you get one arm tilting at a bigger angle than the other, ure essentially distributing the weight of the TV unevenly on the back frame, hence the wall. Its not going to bring your TV down but if you're looking for max precision, I recommend you get a protractor before adjusting the angle.The other flaw IMO, was the length of the safety bolt. With bigger TVs, the distance from the lower end of the TV to the safety bolt is too long, and if you have a Plasma/LCD TV, there's virtually no gap between the wall and TV (the bottom frame of the TV rests on the wall if you tilt around 7 degrees downward). The predicament here is that unless you have dainty hands (or a philips head screw driver with a 10inch arm length) you're struggling to snake back and get to the safety bolt. Obviously the safety bolt can't be fastened before you put the TV on the wall.Tips:The back arms are pretty easy to mount (highly recommend using spacers so you dont thread the bolts too deep into the TV).Use a protractor to adjust TV angleMount the wall piece lower, and move the TV higher using the arms, as opposed to the other way round.Get a REALLY long philips head screw driver for the safety boltSummary:Great TV mount, cheap and easy to install. Requires some planning and maybe putting the TV up a couple of times before you get the correct angle and position. Definitely worth the price, and a fun DIY project.If your TV ports are on the back surface(i.e. not on the side panes), try getting a bigger tilt to make some space between the wall and TV to fit the HDMI cable heads.Highly recommend the product.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value, easy to install", "Author": "J.

Hard life, huh?Why I like it: It is a very sturdy mount. Made out of thick and quality materials. Easy to put together. Price is awesome.What I don't like: Some components are difficult to get to with larger televisions. Like I think there is a screw or something you are supposed to tighten once the television is on the mount; I can't reach it. I don't think it is an issue for me as I don't live in an area that has earthquakes, and the television is sitting pretty firmly on the upper portion of the mount. Also, the back panel for outputs/inputs is very difficult to reach on the Samsung television. I have to pull the television off the wall in order to plug something into the back panel, which isn't very easy with a 46\" television. Instructions are also bit screwy, but it is pretty intuitive how it is supposed to piece together, so it is just minor annoyance. As a side note, triple check to make sure the mount is level if you have a huge television! My mount was within the level range, but since the television is pretty large, it is still noticeably skewed by a tiny bit.This television mount gets a 5 star for being a sturdy mount, easy to install, and not yet having my television smash onto the ground and possibly smooshing my dog who likes lying underneath it. I docked off a star because I don't think it is designed very well for larger televisions and creates some minor inconveniences.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but could be better", "Author": "Nate Train \"Nate Train\"", "ReviewID": "R1S257E48FBD6Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked up this mount for my Sharp 857u 60 inch tv.After I opened the box I noticed all pieces are in plastic however there were a few locking washers loose in the box. Luckily nothing was missing.The mount has to be assembled which is pretty easy, just make sure all nuts are tight. It comes with 2 different types of levels so there's no excuse to not have it level on the wall in the end.Make sure this will fit your tv. Even though it says, \"up to 65\"\" doesn't mean it will fit. Check the vesa on your tv. This just fit my tv as I had to use the very last hole for the screw on the brackets to fit my tv.The mount comes with a lot of bolts for different types of walls so it's really easy to attach it to the wall.Here's where I had an issue with it.There is no space below the tv once it's up. I had to use a few spacers on the brackets, but even if I used all of them I can't get underneath the tv to tighten the screws underneath that help keep the brackets secure in place on the mount itself. Even if I had a long screwdriver I still wouldn't be able to tighten them.There will always be a slight tilt so if you plan to use this mount to keep your tv flat, it might not happen and you might want to get a mount without the tilt option or one that can swing out. It might be possible with using more spacers to even the brackets out with the wall mount, but all depending on your tv, it's possible it just won't happen.It you want to change the tilt angle at a later point on a large tv without having to take the tv off of the mount good luck.A really good tip is make sure you plug in all of your cables before putting the tv on the mount.The price of the mount is great and can't be beat, but for me I think another route would have been better. If the screws that are underneath to help lock the bracket in place were easier to get to, I'd give this mount a better review.

Luckily, our installer had surprisingly worked with this very model many many times in our area.Forget what the thing is made of or how it is packaged or how it doesn't look like the rack mounts you purchase from Costco or Best Buy.

Hatos", "ReviewID": "RDFO1FEH5N5QF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So many satisfied customer. I am a bit puzzled. I am mechanically inclined, in other words I have usually no problem to assemble like this  wall mounted bracket. My TV is a 38\" size, pretty heavy, just about the maximum weight that I am able to lift above my head. I needed a bracket that holds my TV straight, but  angles it downward. I am sure for a smaller TV this bracket would do much better, but for my TV it was difficult to install. I am also sure it did not helped that I wanted my TV pretty high just a few inches below the ceiling. I was using a small step ladder for the job. The material is OK, but I can't imagine to put a 65\" TV on this bracket. Please leave me a note if anybody have used it for a 50\" or larger TV. I am just very curious.The biggest problem is angling downward and still able to tightening the screws that secures the hook pat of the bracket. It is pretty much a guessing game. Depends of the TV size, for me I needed about a 18\" long screwdriver that I did not have. To maximize the angle, the TV eventually touches the wall and yet that angle is actually not that much,  but then there  is no way to reach the security screws, so you can't maximize the angle, you need to leave space for the screwdriver to reach.  So the final angle that I was able to get is very small and for my convenient is not enough. For a larger TV forget the angle. My recommendation place two about 1\" think wood  strip between the bracket and the wall. That way the whole thing moves inward from the wall and gives more space for the screwdriver to reach and in the same time able to gain a few more degree angle downward.  Also if you need a very long screwdriver Harbor-Freight had it and it is  pretty cheap.So, for smaller TV the bracket is good enough for the price. For around 38\" TV is it much easier if two people doing the work, and do not expect much angle downward. For larger TV this bracket for my opinion is questionable, unless your TV is very light.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "cannot remove TV from mount", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "R1C6IEVWOJHM3R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I cannot remove my TV from the mount.

The bubble level is a little bit cheap, but it worked fine.  If you want to be extra sure, just use a measuring tape to get the floor-to-mount distance equal on both sides.While I could imagine that there are mounts that use thicker gauge metal than this, I can't fathom why you'd need it.  Once this thing was bolted to wall studs with lag bolts, it was absolutely rock-solid.  It also fits a variety of TV's with ease and it is extremely easy to take TVs on and off the wall mount.  We first used it with a smallish 32\" TV.  Once we upgraded to a 55\" we simply removed the rails from the back of the TV, bolted them to the back of our new TV (with the larger bolts and some spacers that came with the mount), and hung our new TV back on the frame.  It felt just as solid and sturdy with the big TV mounted as the smaller one.  I doubt I could pull the TV off the wall if I tried; I'd probably end up breaking the TV itself before the mount gave out.The bottom line is, if you want a simple wall mount, don't bother with anything more expensive than this.  Just get this one.  It is way more than strong enough, easy to mount, and even comes with an HDMI cable.  What more could you possibly want for 25 bucks?*Addendum: The hardware that came with the mount were 2\" lag bolts of perfectly reasonable quality.  However, the wall I was mounting to had extra thick drywall and necessitated the purchase of extra-long lag bolts to reach the studs.  The included bolts should work for just about any standard wall but if you are having trouble bolting the mount up (or just want to be extra sure), use this easy procedure:1. Find a stud2. Get a long nail, place it on top of the stud, and start tapping it gently into the wall with a hammer.3. The nail should sink easily through drywall and meet resistance once it gets to wood.  Once that happens, pull the nail out.4. The depth that the nail sunk in tells you the thickness of your drywall.  You'll want at least 1/2\" longer lag bolts than that.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "great value for money", "Author": "SG", "ReviewID": "R25NEN5YIQFAYC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will keep it shortpros:simple and very cost effective.the additional HDMI cable was a bonuscons:instructions inadequate (i was prepared for it as I had read other reviews)no instructions for dry wall.

The screw head is not quite big enough to overlap each side of the holes in the metal square mount, but one of the washers that comes with the kit does the trick.  I also had to rent a 1.5'' rotary hammer drill from Home Depot ($20/day) to drill into the cinder block; a cordless drill will not do the trick.  So far these anchors seem sturdy enough to handle my TV.I don't like that you have to eyeball the angle adjustment up to 15 degrees.

As a result when I tried to mount my 60\" TV with it I was not able to do so quite where I wanted the TV to fit.  In my desired location the mounting bolts for one side were only 2 slots from the center on the left side and almost all the way to the outside on the right side.  When I put the TV on it, the left side of the unit actually bent out from the wall so the TV hung out further on the left.  I had to rehang the unit with the mounting bolts on both sides being in the second slots in on both sides, thus the TV was shifted to the right from where I really wanted it, but since the mounting bolts had to go into the wall studs I had no choice.  In summary, if you want to mount a unit in a specific spot that is not going to be centered, you might want to get a heavier gauge type mount.  Also the TV is extremely tight to the wall so I had to install HDMI cables with 90 degree plugs.

The downside to this mount is that it the upper and lower bars come in 4 pieces that have to be joined in the middle with a couple screws and a joining plate. This is not a problem if you are centering your TV in the middle of the mount. However, due to the location of my wall studs, and where I wanted the TV, I have to move the TV to the far right of the mount. This is fine, except that the mount tends to sag just slightly at the joint in the middle when weight is on the right which causes the TV to dip just slightly, like 3/8 of an inch. It doesn't sound like much, but for anyone who has mounted a TV before, even a tiny bit off level is noticeable. I was able to solve this issue by cutting a piece of stock aluminum to use as a post to prop up the middle of the mount to keep it from sagging, but this kind of defeats the purpose of buying a ready made mount. I learned my lesson in being cheap.

Not excited about that so I got a bracket elsewhere that is 42\" wide as opposed to this one from Cheetah that is ~28\". I am a little curious as to why (with home studs 16\" on center in MOST homes) this thing should not be made 5-6\" longer minimum to potentially span three studs (and easily span two) so as to maximize the chance of getting anchors into studs. I am not mounting my $2k plus TV with molly(s). Ugh. Anyway, I think if you have a TV more along the 32\"-40\" this might prove OK if you don't get lucky with wall alignment like I did.

The design is not so good because they recommend tightening the mount with some screws on the bottom, but once the TV is on the wall the only way to get the screws into the holes and tighten them is with a screwdriver that is at least as long as half the height of the TV. That could be a two foot screwdriver in some cases which most people do not have lying around.For peace of mind I would recommend a different mount with thicker looking metal.

I have a Samsung from 2006, and it weighs about 70 pounds (very heavy), so if you have anything newer then you should not have a worry in the world.My one hang-up about the mount (no pun intended) is that it does not allow for much space behind the TV; even at a repositioned angle.

They have all worked without issue or modification. For most this mount will be the same. However if you have one of the larger Samsung LED LCD's (or maybe all newer LED Samsung's), I would pass on this mount. The main problem is that the VESA mounting holes on the back of the Samsung are recessed and not flush with the back of the TV. Therefore when you screw the back of the mount into the TV, the washers will not make contact with anything when the screw is fully tightened and lead to \"play\" in the arms. To overcome this, you have to use all the washers in the bag to fill the gap space. The problem is that the other washers will not have the same diameter and you will need to expand them. I used a dremel to \"hack\" the other washers so they would fit. And you will have to use ALL the washers in the bag.TV Mounted: Samsung UN65F6400 - 65 inBottom Line: Not plug and play with Samsung TV's that have recessed VESA mounts.I will also concur with others comments that the safety screws are nearly impossible to access with a 65 in TV. From the bottom of the mount to the bottom of a Samsung 65 inch TV is 12 inches. So you need a screwdriver that has a tip of 14 inches minimum to tighten the safety screws.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would Have Been 5 Star (*****) But....", "Author": "H.

I had to use custom longer bolts and add 1 inch cushion so that I can keep it at an appropriate distance from the wall to provide some room for the HDMI cable and power chord . Secondly, the vertical mounts that stick to the TV with these bolts are so small that there was no room to adjust the TV height using the multiple slots for bolts that were on these vertical mounts. The bolts were at the two extreme ends of these mounts for my TV to fit. But I an happy that they at least  fit, else I would have to return it. I would suggest that the manufacturer should include longer bolts and cushions as  an option for such TV's and the length of the vertical panels should be such that its adjustable and can be lengthened or they are made bit longer in the first place.Last thing - The included HDMI cable did not work . My TV started flicking with a sound (tuk..tuk......tuk) and when I replaced the HDMI cable, that I was using previously , It went away.Apart from the above it works and the price is attractive and with a free HDMI cable , the deal becomes irresistible! :)", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R2GI1JR3VTXOPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can only reiterate the other favorable comments that caused me to buy this.

Based on all other reviews I was expecting a better product then what I received!!!  Here are the issues I had with these mounts:1)  You have to assemble the frame of the mount.  Not a hard task but instructions are lousy!  The biggest issue with assembling these mounts was the side bar that connects the top and bottom rail.  If you look at the picture on the instructions it appears they both face towards each other, this is not the case because the holes don't line up that way.2)  It's nice that is is relatively flat unit that makes TV appear flush against wall, but no room to connect cables unless the connectors are recessed in or on the side like the newer Samsung LED's.  You will also have a tough go at tightening the screw underneath since its so flush!3)  This mount is suppose to be able to tilt but physically impossible with the 60\".  The bottom portion of the TV pushes it away from wall so you can not tilt and mount it.  Larger TV's have to be mounted flat.4)  Studs are usually 16\" apart so the best the mount will catch is middle and one edge.  If you try to mount it center on a wall you may have difficulty lining up the base with the mounts to catch the studs.Worked ok for the 47\" but will have to look for a better mount for the 60\" plasma.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "great sturdy wall mount for both 32 inch and 60 inch TV", "Author": "P.K.", "ReviewID": "R2VAHUDA3WD7GY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great wall mount for multiple sizes.

This review is quite long but if you want the quick summary here it is.This wall mount is one of the worst I have seen in my experience. The frame is a thin and flimsy 2 pieces that must be assembled before installation. Very cheap overall, I believe the only thing that makes this wall mount appealing is the price compared to what you will pay at a physical store and the perceived value of the included HDMI cord and level. But does it work? Yes it does as I installed a fairly heavy 50\" Panasonic plasma. For a similar price on amazon there are much better mounts.Pros: does what it's supposed to doCons: cheap, flimsy, low quality, have doubt's of its maximum rate weight capacityFull review:Comes with all the hardware to put the mount together and includes most common mounting screws for your TV. Includes one tool a small level, an HDMI cable, and instructions. The instructions are adequate and easy to follow.Wall Mount frame bracket is by far one of the worst. Why? Because it is thin gauge steel and is two pieces. Also the two halves are held together by small screws with nuts. You also need extra tools that are unnecessary for the common wall mount installation such as either an adjustable wrench or tiny sockets for those tiny nuts on the screws. Also the screw hole openings make putting together the bracket difficult because they don't line up perfectly. On my wall mount the holes didn't line up so badly that I had to drill into the metal frame to make one of the holes line up. Once the wall bracket frame is put together it is very easy to bend. What you want to look for in a wall bracket is a solid one piece frame with heavy (thick) gauge steel. The height and width of the frame aren't even that important as long as the thickness of the steel is thick and solid.The arm brackets that are attached to the TV aren't that bad. They are on the low end but of God enough strength not to easily bend. They do an adequate job of mounting the TV to the wall bracket. They come with screws to lock the tv from being lifted from the wall after it has been installed. This is pretty standard as many wall mounted have the same screw to lock the TV. No complaints here for the arm brackets. They do allow to tilt the TV down if needed and have to be tightened to hold the angle you choose.I installed a 50\" Panasonic plasma and it was fairly heavy at about 60-80 lbs nothing difficult for 2 people to carry. I didn't notice any issues but I seriously doubt this mount can hold a TV up to 165 lbs. TVs are getting thinner and lighter and I bet modern TVs don't even come close to that weight and believe the manufacturer makes such a claim to promote confidence in a buyer and is a bluff since it will be rare if a TV that weight ever gets installed.From the perspective of a TV installer, putting together the two halves of the frame does take a long time which adds to the overall time to install a TV. Also the holes didn't line up and I had to modify the wall mount frame by drilling into the metal to make it work. Time is money and an installer wants to install a TV as quickly as possible to keep a customer happy and to fit more installations in a day.From a value standpoint this wall mount offers a low value because it is very cheap. Low price but you get low quality. The included HDMI cable doesn't add much value as these can be had for as little as $2-3 on eBay. The included level isn't much of a bonus either since this is a pretty common tool around the house. And for those that don't have any, they Can be had at a local dollar store for a buck.It is definitely a 3 star product. Would rate it less but it does what it's supposed to do and for a low price. But I can argue with you all day that there are much better products in this price range here on amazon. I've tried brands like avf which has been my low price favorite here on amazon for quality wall mounts. Designer habitat also offers good mounts for a low price but stay away from their 2 piece designs. Don't be fooled by the perceived value of the included HDMI cable as it's best to put the most money on the wall mount itself and buy the cables separately. If you want really good mounts, Sanus is a good brand if you can afford them as their mounts use very heavy gauge steel and are very sturdy.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Mount, but some problems", "Author": "Robert Smith", "ReviewID": "R2DUDQQYYUMWTF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This mount is sturdy, but the side portions do not line up exactly.

Although some may comment that the instruction were lacking, I did not find it to be that difficult once you read and study the parts.  This kit comes with the wall mount (which comes in four total parts and will have to be assembled), adjustable TV brackets and a plethora of screwing options, two bubble levels and as a bonus, a 10' HDMI cable. The slotted holes in the wall plate will allow for as many connections as you'd like to the wall. The tricky parts about the mounting process is setting the angle (which you need to do BEFORE attaching the bracket to the tv) and screwing the set screws once the tv is hung.My trick to setting the angle is using a flashlight (or laser pointer if you have it) and with the butt against the wall approximately where the center of the screen would be and shining it toward your viewing location (head high).  Look at the angle you need and transfer to the bracket.  The set bracket exactly the same, lay them side by side flat on the ground and screwing them in place. The set screws at the bottom of the bracket is there so that the tv will not lift out of the wall plate accidentally, but it's really hard to get to without a very long screwdriver.  I ended up not tightened mine but in it's location, I do not anticipate any physical contact with it at all.All in all, a very good deal for a pretty good mount.  My tv was only a 42\" Plasma that weighs around 40-50 lbs. but I can see this thing easily holding up more. My biggest fear is not tv falling off the mount rather the mount falling off the wall.  If you are going into wood stud(s), the supplied lag screws will be sufficient.  I had to go into just 1/2\" drywall so I used 8 drywall anchors (50 lbs capacity each) and two metal stud screws into the only stud available.

Couple that with my incompetence with mounting something on the wall and keeping it level, and you have a recipe for failure.So how did it turn out? I reorganized my living room to put the TV/entertainment system in front of a wall. I decided to save up for mounting kit, and was shocked when my search found this one. $25 shipped? Seriously? New? It's not broken or missing pieces? I hit 'buy' right away. No saving up required.The mounting process took some time. All of the measuring, marking the way, using the included level to make the holes even(I failed at this), finding wall studs, etc took me a while.  Unfortunately, the wall studs in my wall weren't spaced out optimally for the holes in the wall bracket. I made compromises and figured that it would hold my TV ok.Getting then mounting brace on my television took some work. Again the wholes didn't line up perfectly, so I made compromises on how high I wanted to the TV. Don't get me wrong, this item gives you a lot of flexibility, it's just with so many different mounting environments that it has to work with, it can't be perfect for all of them.ProsThe product is well made and not flimsy in any way. They give you good instructions and different thicknesses of screws and even tell you what drill bit size to use.Cons:The large level that this unit comes with seems to be off a bit. I used to for this product and for a couple of posters that I mounted yesterday and what it said was level definitely wasn't. I recommend using your own level or measure and remeasure the height of the holes to make sure that they are the some.Since I'm so bad at making items level, I'm going to look for an attachment for my television that let's you correct the level of the screen after you mount the wall brackets.

Works well. Cheap (cost, not quality) which is always a plus.One small issue which cost it 1start for me. When you put any TV I say larger than a 42\" and you intend on angling it (using the upto 15degree adjustment), first realize that 15degrees is not really 15degrees, that only apples to say a 32\". Once you get a larger TV the bottom of the TV will hit the wall before you even get to say 10degrees. That really isnt a huge issue to me, but the bigger issueis once you get that angle you want, lets say you max it out in my case on my 60\", its barely 5degrees angle, you have absolutely zero ability to access the screw on the bottom side of the mount where you must screw it down to keep the TV from being lifted off the mount.So you thinking let me screw that bottom one first before angling it, well if you tighten the bottom one you cannot angle it anymore because the screw keeps it from allowing the TV to get angled because the angle itself requires more length between the bottom of the bracket mount and the top of the hook part. So you have to losen the bottom screw at least 5turns then angle it. Then once you angle it, good luck tigtening down the hand screw to keep the TV from angling more or being pushed back.Thats the biggest issue with these slim mounts, there is zero zoom to put even a screw driver in once its on the wall to make adjustments or tighten a screw down.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awsome Mount", "Author": "Francise R Reeves", "ReviewID": "RBTZDSHIV39NP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I read the reviews and was a little skeptical to order.

It is currently holding up my 60\" tv in the living room and looks great. The only drawback to this product was installing it. I used a drill with a drill bit that allowed me to put the screws that were going into the wall onto the drill, but had a very hard time getting the two bottom screws in. The top two screws were bigger than the bottom two screws so I had to use different drill bits that held the screws. Well it was nearly impossible to find a drill bit that would make the bottom two screws screw into the wall. The one I used only got them in about 1/4 of the way but after that it would not screw them in. It was very frustrating so I ended up using a wrench that locks to screw them in myself that way. It took a while but got the job done. I could have done it with a ratchet but didn't have one and I just wanted to finish installing the mount already since those two screws were the last thing needed for me to have my tv up in the wall so I improvised. I wish all the screws were the same size like the first time I bought this product. I bought it for a 50\" tv and all four screws in that one were the same size so it was very easy to screw them in since they actually fit one of the drill bits I had. The design of it also changed but looks better if you ask me.

I just got a 55 inch tv.  The directions were straight forward and I had all the tools already.  You will need a drill with 3/16'' and 1/8'' drill bits, a stud finder, phillips head screwdriver, socket wrench or adjustable wrench.What should have taken me 30 minutes, ended up taking 3 hours of frustration.  I put the wall plates together, found the wall studs, drilled pilot holes in the wall studs, and connected the bracket to the tv all in about 30 minutes.  The last steps are to connect the tv bracket to the wall plates and tighten the screws.  The last steps sound easy right? Wrong.  I initially had no tilt.  When I connected the tv bracket to the wall plate (all you have to do is hook it in on the top then tighten the screws on the bottom), there was no room for my arm to go behind the tv to tighten the screws or put any cables in.  So then I took it off and decided to do the tilt.  Now I put it back on the wall plate and I now have arm room to put cables in the back of the tv, but I still don't have arm room to tighten the screws on the bottom and now the tilt made it so the screws don't even go under the wall plate anymore.  So I try halfway tilt (same issues as full tilt).  Now I get really frustrated because I thought it was bad design and couldn't work out.  Finally, I did some genius thinking and made it work.  What I did was first (while the tv bracket is not on the wall plate) tighten the final screws on the bracket about 1/4 of an inch.  Then loosen the tilt screws so that it can move.  Put it at the no tilt position then hook on the tv bracket to the wall plate.  The screws on the bottom should barely fit under the bottom of the wall plate.  Then I pulled the tv so that it tilted (This was the reason I loosened the tilt screws).  After causing it to tilt, the screws on the bottom came up under the wall plate on its own and was secure (I couldn't take the tv bracket off unless I pushed it in to cause no tilt).  I just had to lastly tighten the tilt screws (and I was barely able to fit my arm behind the tv to tighten the tilt screws).  In a way it is a good thing it will be so hard to take off because burglars would have a difficult time unscrewing it.  I now have enough room to plug in cables in the back.  I was pretty happy with the end product after I made it work.Pros:-It looks nice-It seems secure-comes with hdmi cable and level-the bad design in a way makes it difficult for burglars or even myself to take it off.  I'm putting this as a pro.Cons:-Mandatory tilt in order for some arm room behind the tv.-I had to make it work.  If you follow the directions, there is no way anyone can tighten those screws on the bottom of the wall plate unless they have a small tv or a super skinny arm.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would recommend this product any time!!

It was a solid, one-piece stamped chunk of steel, very well made, sturdy, I was tickled to death to see how stout it was constructed. Fast forward a few years, I orderd this mount for a 60\" Sony, expecting the same quality. The picture for this item is very deceiving, the upper and lower bars are actually in two pieces that have to be bolted together.The end plates also are flimsy and have to be bolted together to make this one bracket. So, overall it is not near as stout a bracket as the old one used to be. Also, the pivot hanging brackets are made of a metal about hal fthe thickness as my old bracket mounts were.

This kit IS NOT compatible with it. I had togo to the Hardware Store and search through those endless little drawers full of screws to find a screw long enough to attach the frame to my TV. Look at the back of the Sony 32bx330, see the 2 bottom mounting holes?? Now look at the top ones....see the depth difference?? For those of you who dont own this great TV, Ill explain. The bottom mounting holes for the TV are fine, just like every other TV on the market. However, the top holes are somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 to 3 1/2 inces deeper than the bottom ones due to the back of the TV having an irregular shape. Hence, the mounting frame wont attach to both holes simultaneously (without going to the Hardware Store and buying a screw thats about 3 inches longer than the ones provided).Take my advice, for what its worth, look up the recommended Sony Kit here on Amazon and spend the extra $20-30 now, itll make your mounting much much easier.

First the good: I thought the product was well made...a heavy enough gauge. I found the instructions were actually pretty good, I just had to read them a few times. They did mention that the tilt should be adjusted before hanging. So here's my beef: When you hang the TV on the bracket you have attached to the wall, you are then supposed to secure the bottom of the TV with 2 set screws to the bottom channel. The problem is that the screws are supposed to go under the wall bracket and lock it into place in the event of an earthquake or unruly children. Well the bracket is about 1/16\" off so you cannot use the set screws. I scratched my head in this one for a few hours. I thought maybe I could have bent the steel but no way. Then I described the problem to friend and he said he had the same problem. We both decided that the TV seems pretty stable and we haven't had any earth quakes here, so we're not going to take the TVs down and try to bend the brackets. So, it really seems to be a design flaw.

If you can figure out putting furniture together you can probably figure this out.  There are only 6 parts plus screws. You do not need all the bolts they provide, just find the ones that fit your tv.The one thing I would suggest is if you are mounting in solid concrete or block do not use the plastic anchors provided.  They will probably be ok, but on an expensive tv why risk it.  This is especially so for the big tv's.  I chose 3/8 x 3\" redhead sleeve anchors instead.  Probably overkill but the added cost was about 5 bucks.  I attempted to pull it off the wall after installing the brackets and found myself straining.  I'm about 250 lbs so this was pretty impressive to me.  I stopped short of hanging off it.This mount hugs the wall so unless you mount with a plywood board as a spacer you may have trouble with room for plugs or tightening the locking bolts.  I didn't use a board to give me more room so what I did was install the tv flat with no tilt, screw in the plugs a bit then tilt the tv forward.  This pushes those locking bolts behind the fram and the tv locks in.  Something about the angle when you tile it allows this.  if you want to disengage them just lift the tv back to flat mount position.To solve the clearance on my hdmi plug I just whittled some of that extra plastic molding down with my pocket knife.  It honestly wasn't doing much anyway.  If you want to buy a 90 degree adapter do it now through amazon.  The ones at local stores are likely larger than your plug to begin with.Do not listen to the people who say the directions are lacking.  Seriously how many ways could it go together.

We have two other flat panels hung on walls in the house, and I find that only one of the mounts actually makes sense.  Let me explain a bit:Here are my cons with this mount:-Tilting capability is awkward at the least.  There are locking pins that I recommend putting in to keep the angle \"set,\" however, this makes it a fixed mount then.-Because the mounting plate comes in multiple pieces and must be bolted together, there are certain places through which you cannot put lag bolts into studs.  Due to the spacing of studs in the center of my room, I had to mount the TV off-center a couple inches; it's not noticeable to most, but I'm a bit obsessive at times.-A few bolts and washers were packaged wrong, so I had to grab a lag bolt from the garage to complete installation.-The real big problem I have with this is securing the TV on the mount once it is hanging.  You have to reach up behind the TV with a very long screwdriver to tighten down 2 screws to \"lock\" the TV to the bottom of the mount.  With the large TV, I have to reach over 18\" and blindly find those screws from under the TV while it is flat against the wall.  The one mount in our house that I DO like has 2 spring-loaded clips that secure the mount to the wall and has pull strings dangling just out of sight to release those.  Perfect design!  This one?  Well, let's just point out I don't have 18\" screwdrivers, but must create one.I'd appreciate it if Cheetah Mounts would include a tool for this purpose instead of the two levels (that are inaccurate anyway) they sent with the mount.  Or make the security mechanism more convenient to access; Cheetah, think spring-loaded!My pros for this mount:-It is physically capable of holding a 65\" TV that weights just under 95 lbs.-The price is great (about 1/2 what you would find in most stores) making the design flaws much more tolerable.-Pretty good HDMI cable included.As I said, this mount is sufficient for its purpose (holding a 65\" flat panel on the wall).  At this point, I have NOT locked it to the mount.  I will do that once I am sure I don't need to access cords any further this weekend.

It's not worth the hassle.I mounted a 60\" Samsung TV with this mount. The stupid thing is too small to even span the beams in my wall properly (16\" on center). I had to mount the TV 4\" off center from where I wanted it, just so the screw holes would (barely!) line up.After all that fun, I realized that this piece of junk has Philips head screws at the bottom for securing the TV after its mounted. You need a screwdriver with a neck of roughly 24\" in order to reach the screws when mounting a 60\" TV.This thing is in fact so cheaply made that the supplied lag bolts are 2 different sizes. They actually provide smaller lag bolts for the bottom rail of the mount compared to the top (they reduce the strength of the mount). Must have saved them 10 cents. Because of this you have to drill different size holes and find 2 different bits to secure the bolts.Avoid this and buy a mount that uses 4 good large lag bolts. A mount that is long enough to span your beams without having to compromise the location you want to install the TV in. A mount that includes a long Allen wrench to tighten the locking screws.

It was impossible to level the TV because the hooks landed right on top of a bolt head.

Roth", "ReviewID": "R1YLRCBAFT4RIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some of the reviews said the instructions are hard to follow. I thought the mount was pretty simple to assemble and install. You connect the two horizontal pieces using the screws provided, (which are already attached to one side). Locate the studs and attach the mount to the wall. I found that the pilot hole drill sizes were the correct size for the provided lag bolts. Two vertical bars attach to the TV. Many different size screws are provided to account for the different TV mounting holes. You can now hang the TV on the mount. The last step is to tighten the safety screws at the bottom of the vertical brackets. This keeps the TV from jumping off the mount if you should hit it.  A long phillips head screw driver makes this step easier. The mount and brackets are sturdy and made of heavy gauge steel.

I give myself another month before I scrap it and get one that makes me feel safer.  Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get the mounting screws in if you TV is 60 inches.

If I could break it up I would give the Bracket itself 4 Stars and the Hardware that came with it the same, but it really makes me mad to see the lack of effort put into writing directions for the consumer to follow.It also came with an HDMI cable that was 10ft long and looked to be good a level to help you with leveling the bracket. I didnt use it cause it would be smarter to use a level that went the length of the bracket instead of one that is 4 inches long and you have to move it along the bracket to make sure you have it level.The item shipped very fast so 4 stars for that.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Gamer4Life", "ReviewID": "R2H3EHJHGL07CS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, so good.
