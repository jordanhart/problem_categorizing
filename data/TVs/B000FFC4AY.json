{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good choice for a plasma screen", "Author": "D. Marks", "ReviewID": "R2PLNBL8CVAQ30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this model for about six weeks now. It's my first large screen TV purchase but I researched pretty thoroughly beforehand.Pros:1. Beautiful picture both in HD and regular signal. DVD's and even VHS tapes look good as well2. Very competitive price. Most 50\" plasmas are at least $800 more.3. Plenty of inputs and outputs. Multiple inputs for component and composite devices plus a VGA port for PC's.Cons:1. Draws a lot of power. It's 450 watts but that's in line with other similar plasmas.2. Has only a HDMI input for digital whereas many devices such as PC's and cable boxes have DVI. Requires a pricey conversion cable to use. Luckily, I think the component connection looks as good as the HDMI one.3. Controls and menus could be more efficient. Common commands like input selection require arrowing through menus instead of just scrolling through using a single button like most TV's.So far so good though.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Time Bomb", "Author": "C.

I didn't purchase the PSP, so thats the way it goes, but for HP to make the consumer have to replace their TV in a year is unacceptable business practice.FYI...Sony, Panasonic, et al provide replacement parts much more readily.Do yourself a favor and take into account how easy it will be to get service on your TV if you need it.Having said all of that, I'm particularly disappointed because I thought this unit was excellent...while it actually worked.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great picture/size for price", "Author": "Navin Ghisiawan \"Navin\"", "ReviewID": "R2C644OL5JFBKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would give this 4.5 only because it does not have the bells and whistles of the nuch more expensive TV'sGreat plasma for price.

Clow", "ReviewID": "ROFEWJLGUGPH9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV in November 2007, and it failed in February 2009.  I took it to a local TV repair place and they orderd a defective circuit board, only to have the TV blow out that new circuit board too.  They indicated that it was a domino effect, and they recommended replacing 4 circuit boards including the control board, Y-sustain board, upper driver, and lower driver board.  Parts alone would cost more than $700, and even then they would not guarantee that it would be fixed.  I am very disappointed in the reliability of this product.  My warranty was 12 months and it failed not too long after that.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't Do It!  You'll Regret It!", "Author": "T.M.", "ReviewID": "R6MQ6KO7D0EDJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is such a dissapointing TV and the HP service is just the same.  Less than 1 month outside of my warranty the TV has died.  It's experiencing a phenomenon called \"pixel flare\".  Google it.  I'm not the only one.  I have no choices as per the rude HP customer service rep (yes, Chase from Ontario Canada- I'm talking about you!) but to fork over almost $750 for a replacement main control board (and pay someone to put it in).  Not fair!  A $1,500 TV should last more than 1 year.  I implore you- don't make this mistake.

No picture.  The price may look cheap, but if you have to replace your TV every two years, it's really quite expensive.  Also, because HP is not a common brand, you can't program universal remotes from cable/satelitte providers to work with it.  So, you will always need two remotes.  The speakers/sound of the TV are wildly inadequate.  Also, this TV has serious burn problems.  The parts of the picture on the sides of the screen were signficantly brighter after moderate use.  This was due to viewing some non-widescreen broadcasts, which apparently dimmed the more-used pixels significantly.  I WISH I HAD BOUGHT A SONY/SHARP/SAMSUNG/PIONEER.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this", "Author": "C. Bruce", "ReviewID": "R2YT3G22WUNUAR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy this. Do a google search for problems related to this model and you will find numerous hits. For me personally, this TV self-destructed after only a couple of years.  It was on, there was a loud pop, and now it no longer works. I disected it myself to see if it wasn't maybe something simple, like a blown fuse or capacitor, but a fter searching around it seems this is a very common problem.  Replacement parts are somewhat hard to find...but the cost for those parts is around $300-$500.  Having someone actually service it will run you $600-$900, but there are numerous reports of people being unable or unwilling to service this particular TV.Before it died, we experiended many of the problems with pixel flare/MAL discharge issue and the image shuttering when showing images with a lot of white or bright colors.  Again, extremely common problem although there are reports of being able to adjust voltage settings on the PSU and resolve some of them.  If you're comfortable poking around in the guts of your TV, it might not be an issue for you.There's no reason to buy this TV.  It has a history of problems and there are any number of TVs that are as good, if not better, better brands, better features, for less money.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000FFC4AY"}}
