{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Looking for a relatively inexpensive, rather large computer monitor? - Read on ....", "Author": "A. B. Davis \"davisbr\"", "ReviewID": "RDO91XOXWEPJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, like the other reviewer, I didn't buy this through Amazon or online (it wasn't available).I picked it up at a big box warehouse (the \"C\" one), for the munificent sum of 2.5 ben-franklins (the proverbial \"good deal\"). Actually, when I first spotted it, I spent a half hour at the store mulling it over, decided it wasn't exactly what I was looking for, went home and thought about it even more (and did some research), and went back the next day and bought it to try it out (there's a 90 day no questions asked return policy at aforementioned store). So it wasn't an impulse buy per se (almost, but not quite, lol).Just so you don't misunderstand my later comments: the Philips playing streamed HD videos from both Amazon prime and Youtube, etc., right out of the box was quite nice.And once I was moderately successful with some of my initial settings adjustment attempts, it went from looking good to bordering on great (I was testing it with \"Star Gate, the Extended Cut\" movie on bluray, and got lucky with the settings - trust me, it wasn't skill - and we realized how tired our plasma was getting: the colors in the movie introduction, when the camera scans slowly over the Egyptian casket, were just way better on the little Philips than our 50 inch Samsung).So I very much concur with the initial product reviewer, that this is an excellent small screen HDTV for watching movies.--------------------------------------32PFL5708/F7 Specs:--------------------------------------This is a recently introduced smaller HDTV from Philips (I'm guessing, but its primary market niche was probably intended for the bedrooms and dorms of the younger set).The Philips is based around a high quality 1080p IPS panel of 1200:1 contrast ratio, with 178 degree off-axis viewing angles, and a panel native resolution of 1920x1020. (It supports many other resolutions, both HDTV and computer in usage and spec.)It has very decent panel specifications; in particular, the 6.5ms response is quite respectable for most ordinary uses of a computer display (and more than acceptable for HDTV purposes). And the 250 cd/m2 brightness is well within typical monitor specs (it is too bright at max contrast and brightness levels to be comfortable: you have to tone it down).It's listed as 120Hz \"PMR\" ...but as per the usual games that manufacturer's play when trying to tease sales from hapless and typically under informed consumers (who have busy lives that preclude their becoming motivated audio-video geeks), this is a 60Hz display (as pretty much they all are, regardless of what the advertising on the box says). The PMR bit though, is an effective feature that gives you a virtual 120Hz viewing experience.Though it's not the typical razor thinness of some IPS panels, the bezel is attractively thin (its rather nice with a clean look to it IMO).It has very low power requirements, consuming only 43 watts. There's an unobtrusive light blue LED, and on-off hardware button, in the lower RH cornerIt weighs 9 pounds, and rests nicely and evenly on the included desk mount. It does include VESA mounting with a std. 200x200 screw pattern for wall mounting if you prefer (which is important to me, since I have a multi-monitor \"computing environment\", and use custom stands).Video inputs include HDMI1 (which carries sound), HDMI2 (which does not carry sound), and VGA for connection to a computer. If your computer graphics card supports HDMI, you can, of course, use HDMI instead of VGA.There is a rather comprehensive plethora of sound inputs and outputs, including a digital port (nice), if you want to hook into a receiver or home theater system. But the onboard speakers are a surprisingly acceptable alternative for casual listening (and bordering on the rather decent, for computer use). The onboard 2 x 5 watt RMS amp and 5-band EQ includes Dolby AC-3 support (and additional DTS TruSurround audio \"enhancement\").The 32PFL5708 has a single USB port (for playback of pictures if you insert a thumb drive, and doubles for firmware updates).I do not, but I suspect that you could, use it for gaming.As I indicated, for the purpose it was intended - video playback as an HDTV - it is a competent performer, and borders on an excellent choice for the price. And I'd recommend it for that purpose alone if you need a smaller HDTV....and that's all I really have to share about the Philips as HDTV. You can stop here if that's all you were curious about.--------------------------------------Suitability as a Monitor--------------------------------------But buying an HDTV wasn't my intent, at all.I bought this to hook into my new DIY workstation that I'd been assembling from parts purchased the past few weeks (from various online sources, including Amazon) since Black Friday/Cyber Monday (and really, a new, performance-oriented PC, was a major excuse for even considering a new display).I certainly didn't need another HDTV lol.What I wanted was a relatively inexpensive \"big screen computer monitor\" to ease my aging and tired eyes ...and the Philips \"out of the box\" simply wasn't very good for that purpose .Why?Because frankly, on screen text simply wasn't very good (a deal-breaker for me). The colors were off. A lot. What I call \"clarity\" was abysmal. And my uniformly clumsy and uninformed initial attempts at getting things right weren't exactly satisfying (it didn't help that there's not a lot of info out there on this model, so I couldn't just check with any of the online A/V forums and plug in some numbers).But the video playback ...ranged from good to approaching excellent as I tried various settings.On the one hand, great video and bluray disc playback. On the other hand, blurry text, odd screen artifacts, and not-so-great browsing and writing as a PC monitor.So I proceeded to dither over whether to return it , while I kept futzing with it, trying to improve the settings, over the course of the next several days (it was a very attractive price for a computer display of this size, and I'm a sucker for good deals).--------------------------------------How to make it work--------------------------------------Here's what you need to do.First, using the Philips built in tools, turn off overscan and set the sharpness to zero (there will be a dramatic improvement in clarity)Next, download \"Calibrize\" (google it; it should come up first on the search list), and use that to get a rough gamma setting (which will fix a lot of the clarity issues) ...and at this point, you probably have an acceptable display.At this point, you need to download some more advanced calibration tools (which you will need to learn to use). For a start, search for \"Dave Raposa Monitor Calibration!\" for his links to some excellent and free calibration tools available online.If color and clarity are your thing, you might want to consider purchasing a hardware based calibration tool like the Pantone Huey MEU101- which I've owned for many years - or a Datacolor Spyder4Express S4X100 Display Calibration Device. Both are available through Amazon via the provided links.(There are more expensive versions of these kinds of devices available for working professionals, but the Huey I bought almost a decade ago, still works great, and has long since justified its purchase for maintenance alone ...and yes, it's still in use.)--------------------------------------Thoughts:--------------------------------------I've quit dithering: I'm keeping the Philips.It wasn't the display that was the issue, rather it was the way I was going about adjusting the display.I'd just forgotten over the years that to initially set up a computer monitor, you need monitor utilities. I.e., you need display adjustment software tools that you run from the computer, and you cannot rely on tools built into a display.--------------------------------------Conclusion and Recommendation:--------------------------------------If you're looking for a LARGE 1920x1080 monitor for general purpose computer use, to be used at typical desktop viewing distances, the Philips 32PFL5708/F7 should be on your short list (especially if you can pick it up on sale).Although the pixel size is large at desktop viewing distances on 32 inch displays, I find the Philips is entirely suitable for non-professional use as a computer display.Quite nice, actually.Recommend.--------------------------------------\"Pixels\" Backgrounder--------------------------------------To explain to those uninitiated in display arcana, and curious enough to have read this far ....Given a certain size of display, at a given resolution, what is called the pixel density is constant as you increase the size of the display. But the size of the individual pixels has to increase.Think about it: if you have 2,084,600 pixels (which is the number of pixels of a 1920x1080 display resolution, like all 1080p HDTV's, including the little Philips) on, say, a 22 inch panel, and you increase the size of the panel to 32 inches ...well, the number of pixels isn't changing (1080p is always going to be 1080p, and result in approximately 2.1 million pixels), so the size of those individual pixels has to change.So the 32 inches of the Philips has the happy result of having much larger character sizes than my 27 inch workhorse. For aging eyes, this is not a bad thing. Indeed, it is a very good thing.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unrivaled performance!!!", "Author": "sam", "ReviewID": "RV7KYXJ4CVAN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all let me say I did not purchase this from Amazon as this was not available at that time, purchased it from a different web site, I wish I could have waited a little longer as I paid 30 more than the price listed here.Design:Great design very slim profile. Would look like a poster if you mount it up a wall. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the panel is actually IPS!Remote is nice and small, designed for practicality, but I use only my universal remote (Philips)Performance:I have owned Samsung & Sony LED's before this, trust me the picture quality on this way better looking than any TV I've ever seen!! It doesn\u2019t just add too much contrast & color like Samsung does, the emphasis here is on natural picture.I\u2019m familiar with Philip\u2019s proprietary \u201cPIXEL PLUS HD\u201d technology the picture here appears absolutely razor sharp, it\u2019s as if you are looking out of a window!  Even normal SD channels look good, if not hi-def. It is so clear that you can even see the tiniest moles and hairs on the actor\u2019s faces!!(Especially if you\u2019re watching a sensual movie\uf04a)Viewing angle is excellent, no picture deterioration from any angle.A very important thing here is that I used to have lots of discomfort while watching my previous LED over long periods, but with this one it is so comfortable in spite of watching movies the whole night!!Sound:Sound is GREAT for a unit this small. However I\u2019ve hooked up my sound bar.Connectivity:HDMI is hooked up to my Panasonic BD player & Set top box (HD 1080p)Component to Philips DVD player (HD 1080i)Co-axial to Philips sound bar.(HD sound)Overall this is a great TV & definitely a bang for the buck and my entertainment hub for years to come!", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "SWEET!", "Author": "R.
