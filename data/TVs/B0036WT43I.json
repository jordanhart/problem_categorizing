delivery was a disaster because the panel was cracked in several places.  My other 50in 2010 Samsung had the same issue with the first delivery.  So be warned that Samsung is not packing these sets well given their thinness.  Another bummer was the set is made in Mexico and not Japan or Korea.However that has been it.  The picture quality is superb in 2D with all sources.  Even SD looks good.  The speakers are not great on the set but are serviceable.This TV loves HD sources!  You will be amazed.  There are four HDMI inputs.TV is very thin with a dark grey bezel (not the 8000 titanium).I have not tried 3D yet.  Waiting for glasses to lower in price and to get a 3D Blu Ray player.All plasmas buzz to some degree and volume level.  My set buzzes when a show is paused (DVR), but can't be heard otherwise.  Some buzz so loud others return is (common plasma problem) - it is a crap shoot.Important notes:- make sure to update the sets firmware to the latest version (1025+), this will improve the 2D and 3D.- break in the set by running a variable signal for 25-50 hours (constantly moving images - no ESPN) this will help reduce Burn in problems- consider updating the set to C8000 model via the service menu, you will get all the 8000 features for free (like Cinema Smooth)", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "3 months of use... and the verdict", "Author": "Lorraen Badillo", "ReviewID": "R1XSLWWYTGHECQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my husband as a father's day gift. So it was purchased about 3 months ago. Here is my full impression.PictureAt the store:When I was walking around in the store I saw this TV with Avatar going on it and right next to it was the equivalent non-3D Samsung in addition to all the other TVs. There is a huge difference in picture. The best way I could describe it is, it looks like a very high def documentary. What the sales guy said about that crisp effect is that since the TV is built to do so much heavy work for 3D, the 2D benefits in it's picture as well.I did NOT buy this TV to watch anything in 3D, I do not even own the glasses because they give me headaches. The picture quality in 2D is simply that good. The only times I've had issues with how anything looks on the TV it has always been from the source. Low quality TV show output. Blue Ray looks incredible.At home:At first it took a LOT of getting used to, it's SO detailed and sharp that it really does kinda feel very odd watching this TV. We watched movies we had seen many times before and found ourselves seeing things we never noticed. So there's an adjustment period.3 months later:The TV feels natural to watch now. The odd thing is watching any non 3D TV feels like trying to watch TV with early stages cataracts. The biggest overall difference I've noticed and enjoyed is that the content you're watching is very immersive. It's all fleshed out to a dimension I did not expect from TV. I did notice after some time that the blacks in the TV are somehow a LOT darker than the screen when the TV is turned off. A lot of people think this is somehow important so I thought I'd include that.Technically speaking, I cant find anything to complain about. It's HEAVY!!! There, I complained.Things to know before you buy!!!This TV.. is HUGE. Have someplace to put it before hand. We are having a heck of a time trying to find a decent TV console for under 1k to put this on. So if you don't already own a very large TV stand or furniture that can accommodate it, look for something ahead of time.This TV is HEAVY. My hubby is 6'6\" and we are both in decent shape and moving this thing is a task not taken lightly. Make sure you got someone to help move it.This TV is EXPENSIVE. There are a lot of TV's out there for very cheap that will likely suit most people's needs. We put off buying an upgrade TV for 10 years (drooling over our friend's flat screens and working out bums off to save up for one).For us, I wanted to reward that patience and fiscal responsibility with the biggest TV I could get my hands on that had the best picture I could find and this was it. I have zero buyer's remorse but I did think to myself after a while, if we had not been saving up to splurge after much sacrifice... would I still have bought this?The answer was HELL YES!Funny anecdote. Hubby tried playing The Force Unleashed for an hour and got motion sickness and threw up LOL. It's that immersive!! So don't play video games on it till you have gotten used to it.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV but has issues.", "Author": "vin", "ReviewID": "R1F2BR6H8SS1BT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tv is by far an awesome tv. i have had it for 3 weeks and am blown away by the video quality. all the apps and everything are awesome. the quality is almost too real for anyone to get used to but no complains there. One thing you definitely do notice the first time you watch any hd content is some kinda juddering in the images. it is distracting. i contacted the support center several times and they had me try different settings on the tv, none of which solved the issue. at this point a service technician is coming out to check and tv and see what he can find defective. if he can't solve the issue i might think of sending the tv back. sad but i dont want to just put up with some issues after paying a heavy price tag. please be aware of this issue. i dont think samsung themselves are aware of this issue and no how to fix it. if they are able to fix it i will post an update to this reivew. try to hold off on buying for now.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hackable", "Author": "frankebaby", "ReviewID": "R2E2OYZOE30KX3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great set for the money. It can easily be turned into the 8000 series with a simple service menu hack. All you need to do is enter a few buttons in your remote to achieve this. The 3D is great, and  I don't imagine how it could be any better on the Sony or Panasonic. 2D->3D conversion is excellent both with gaming and movies. Do some research and get the proper settings to get the most out of this set.

Discoloration Problem.", "Author": "AmazonShopper_MY", "ReviewID": "R2XAVQ2C93TL1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Using the HDMI input from the Blue Ray player started to produce Red screen after a couple of days of usage.First I thought the the Red screen is produced by the Blue ray player but later I verified the problem is not because of the Blue ray player, it is because of the bad HDMI input circuitry of the TV. I verified that the Samsung PN63C7000 TV is producing the Red colors anytime I switch to HDMI inputs (It has 4 HDMI inputs, all producing same red screen). I was suspecting the 10-foot \"high speed HDMI cable\" from monoprice causing the discoloration problem. I connected the same cable to the HDMI inputs of my other LED TV and the screen was good. I used 4 ft \"high speed HDMI cable\" on both TVs, Samsung PN63C7000 TV produced red colors, the other older LED TV produced the normal colors. When I used my Denon receiver to output signals via the HDMI cable to the any one of 4 HDMI inputs of the TV, I get red screen.When the TV is in TV mode or Internet@TV mode (Such as netflix, local network, etc.), it displays the channels correctly without any discoloration. I am not sure what caused the TV to go bad in the first couple of days of usage. It may be result of Blue Ray player overheating excessively and producing out of tolerance signals to the HDMI inputs of the TV thus causing the sensitive TV input circuitry to fail.My PN63C7000 TV suffers from the same Motion Judder issue.I did not notice any buzzing from my TV that some other owners are complaining about.See my review for a Samsung Blue ray player overheating problem here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QP41FG/ref=oss_product8/10/2010 Update: I updated the firmware from 1022 to 1026 using flash memory. Red screen on HDMI video sources diminished a lot but there are still red artifacts rendering the video unacceptable to watch.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Darin Kelly", "ReviewID": "R28K2OQQD110IA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided about a month ago to upgrade my HDTV.  I had a Sony 50\" 1080p SXRD rear-projection TV.  Great TV.  It has served me well for about 4 1/2 years.  I decided though that I wanted a 60\" or larger flat panel tv so I started the research.  First off anything 60\" or larger I soon realized was going to run me 2000 dollars or up.  I at first wanted an LED/LCD tv but after a lot of research, reading reviews, comparing the pictures in local stores, and speaking with friends/family who own plasmas, I decided on the plasma.  To me the Plasmas offered a better picture and a better value than LED.  I also got sole on Samsungs after viewing them in store.  I did like that Panasonic Viera as well, but it was almost a grand more expensive than the comparative Samsung. So I ordered the pn63c7000 from Amazon.It arrived within a week, actually 6 days, from when I ordered it.  The Shipping company, home direct, called me a couple days before and arranged a time to deliver.  We settled on 9am to 1pm and they arrived at my house at 9:12 am.  Very nice.  They loaded it in the house and unboxed it so I could check it over good for damages.  Everything looked great.  I let it sit in the house to get to room temperature and after about 6 hours of that, I hooked it all up to my directv and 3d bluray player and turned it on.Very simple set up, the tv works very well with the 3d bluray player.  The picture simply blew me away. I had high expectations for it after viewing it at a local HHgregg, and my expectations were met and exceeded.  We were watching something on HBOHD, which is only 1080i and the picture was so large and clear it looked like we were in the same room with the actors.  Awesome.I have heard no buzzing sound that others have spoke of.  I have tried to listen for it and have not heard anything.  The TV is a bit heavy, about 100 pounds, but not a problem for 2 people to lift into place.  I do have some ambient light in the room I have it in, but I don't get any annoying glare or anything.  I am doing a 100 hour break-in for it, playing nothing but full screen HD content from directv, no gaming, 3d watching, bluray movies, etc.  I'm also being sure to not to watch anything with bars (at top or bottom) during this break-in period.  From the research I did, if a proper break-in period is done, the issues of IR and burn in are minimal.  The TV does have some built in features to keep IR and burn-in from happening, but only time will tell though.About the only criticism I have of the TV is the sound, it isn't the best, but I can hear it just fine and don't have any issues with it, although I do plan on setting up a soundbar or surround system to it.Overall I am, so far, very pleased with this TV, it has the best picture of any tv I've ever looked at in person and is plenty big enough for the room I have it in now (I sit about 15 feet from the TV).  For anyone considering a 60\"+ TV for under 3k, this is the one to get.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Bruno Soares", "ReviewID": "R1ZPBOOZ8G98ST", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for a little over 2 weeks now.  I really like it.  Picture quality is amazing, Plasma just looks way better than LCD/LED.  I replaced an LCD and I couldn't be happier.  3D was not the reason why I bought it, for now I just think 3D is OK and not worth the extra money.  I only got it because of a great deal on the set so I took it.The internal speakers are horrible, don't count on that as your main speakers if you like audio at all.  Definitely get something external.  I didn't expect the TV to have great sound anyways as it's only 1.4\" thick and barely has room for decent speakers.It seems to be pretty well built and it's packed with features.  The wi-fi stuff requires additional wi-fi adapter but it has an Ethernet port if you have a router nearby.The only thing I don't like about it is the buzzing.  All Samsungs I've seen to date buzz.  This one has a directional buzz that only affects those sitting right in front of it and at the exact height too.  If you're standing up, lying down, or seating away from center position you can't hear the buzz.  I decided to live with it as the picture is so good.I give it 4 stars overall due to the buzzing and poor speakers.  Otherwise it would get a solid 5 stars.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT TV!  (Guys: I got this as MY own engagement gift from fiance!)", "Author": "That one guy", "ReviewID": "R1TATOC4MOKYIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a GREAT TV!  I'll try to keep this concise. (except for a funny story also)TV Review info:Picture quality - AMAZING.  I wouldn't say I'm a videophile, but a more than average informed \"regular\" user.  The picture is amazing right out of the box (I haven't even calibrated it yet!).  I haven't yet noticed the Juddering issue, and I believe this is due to having the latest software update.  I've watched TV shows, sports and video games - ALL GREAT.  No slowdowns or refresh issues at all yet.Design - BEAUTIFUL TV.  The brushed black is really a pretty design feature and arguably even better than the C8000 series.  The remote control even looks great; maybe not quite as cool as C8000, but still has brushed black finish and raised buttons (which are easier to use).  The slim depth of the TV (1.4\") is pretty impressive and puts it next to some of the current LCD/LED TVs on the market.Samsung Apps - Onboard apps are great.  This is a great way to consume additional media (Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, etc).  Easy to set up and great for use on such a big screen!  It's good enough to not need to use my XB360 or PS3 for these features.  If you want more (such as full browsing, use your PS3, hook up a PC or get Google TV).Speakers - sound quality is decent considering their size and depth of the TV.  I would suspect people buying this TV would likely have a home theater set up anyway.  Good for most general purposes.Buzzing - my impression is that all plasmas exhibit some buzzing and the reviews consistently seem to be OK, with a few exceptions of people having buzzing issues.  With my own set, I've noticed that if I sit with a direct view at the center of the screen and volume turned 2 or lower, I notice a VERY SLIGHT buzz.  Turn the volume up or don't sit quite that way, and it's NO problem.3D - I haven't tried the 3D yet....(debating whether I'll even keep the 3D glasses starter kit).  Will update once I try if anything notable (good or bad)Even though I didn't try the C8000 TV, my guess is that the C8000 would appear better in some regards, but only when the two are side by side - based on reviews, I think the \"Real Black Filter\" from the 8000 series would make some difference, but it's probably more noticeable to true videophiles.  Otherwise the C7000 TV is a GREAT TV, and for the difference in price, I am more than confident to recommend that anyone purchasing it would be very happy and satisfied with it.On a fun note - I have to give this as a note of praise to my fiance and encouragement to men/women out there dating (hopefully inpspiration for those dating and considering marriage).  While dating my now fiance, I lobbied hard that it seemed unfair that women got a ring, while men didn't get any gift in return (such as a nice watch or sweet TV).  My fiance argued that men get \"the woman\" - that should have been enough.  I respectfully disagreed and indicated that conversely, women get \"the man\".  After some thorough discussion and raising the issue in front of some of our close friends.....I was told to stop bringing it up if I ever wanted a chance for that to come true.  Fast forward...I proposed in late August this year and then just recently (week of Thanksgiving), she informed me of her intention to buy me a large TV as my engagement gift.  The only other concession was that I had to pitch in for a new TV stand to go with it (of her choosing).  Fast forward a few more weeks and we now have this TV!Men - may this serve as inspiration that you seek equality in the engagement process (and get a cool gift too)! :)Women - may this serve as an example that it seems fair for men to get something too when he proposes to you :) :)", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "A few 3D Issues, but TV is superb", "Author": "Ithaca Chasma", "ReviewID": "R299P6A944XBS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the PN63C7000 to replace a 50\" Sony.

I suspect that this is an under-designed \"battery-saving\" feature intended to shut the power to the glasses when 3D is turned off.  The glasses have a small \"on-off\" button above the right lens, but you can not easily tell if the glasses are on.The TV will also permit 3D viewing of virtually any broadcast programming and this feature works surprisingly well.

I replaced it with this 3d Plasma from Samsung.First, the picture on 2d is clearer, sharper, and richer in color and blacks than the S2 which makes me happy.  The 3d is spectacular.  I tried the 2d to 3d conversion found in the menu.  It actually did convert regular HD TV programs to 3d.  It's not quite as good as made for 3d movies and programs but good never the less.This is much more complex TV the Panny S2.  There are quite a few apps, and updates through the ethernet connected feature is easy and fast. There are 4 HDMI inputs compared to 3 for the Panasonic.  It's about 40 pounds lighter, and the screen is about an inch thick compared to the 3 inch Panasonic.I had one problem connecting my 3d Blu Ray player (Samsung C6900).  I don't have a 3d capable receiver, but it does have HDMI inputs and output.  So I connected by HDMI directly to the TV to preserve the 3d capability, and connected to the amp with an optical connection.  The Video was fine.  The audio came out as pcm 2 channel.  I researched the the problem and scanned the Manual.  I didn't find any information that helped.  I called Samsung, and they had no clue.  They elevated it to a higher tier, but never called me back.This Blu ray player when first connected initalizes fast and easy to the TV.  There is no menu button.  I solved my audio problem myself by simply noticing a settings icon appeared on the lower right screen. That opened numerous menus including audio.  By selecting the audio out to optical, I got my 5.1 sound!  It doesn't seems to be able to play 7.1, but I'm still working on it.

But i thought since it was a plasma anyways, it should already have pretty deep blacks. Or at least deep enough. But boy was i wrong. The black levels are terrible, more like a very dark grey. Or a light black. My Mitsubishi DLP TV with Dark Detail has darker blacks than this plasma. This is just really upsetting. They say that Plasma's are suppose to have the deepest blacks out there, but LED is naturally a lot deeper. Other than that the picture is good with a wide range of colors. The 3D is impressive.

I'm very meticulous about what I buy and based on reviews, forum readings, open issues, etc.  This TV is great and for it's price it is absolutely awesome.  There are 2 things that I had trouble with.  First issue is the soap opera effect.  This is just a setting that can be turned off by going to Game Mode and toggling it ON then OFF.  Simple.  Samsung might have screwed up somewhere and left it ON all the time.  You have to do this toggling for each TV input.  I have done all the Samsung updates and everything is so far perfect and unaffected.  The second issue is the Standard picture setting.  I think it's a little too dark for the room.  Compare it to dynamic mode (which is how I watch some sports games when I care).  You can look through the TV forums and find an optimal setting for the TV and you will be happy.  There are some items in the menu that don't seem to affect the picture very much.  I guess this is OK since I love how the picture is already.  The contrast ratio is solid.  The video when watching high speed stuff like racing and other sports is fabulous.  The speakers are fairly weak, but is OK for regular viewing.  When I'm watching games or movies, I wouldn't want them without turning on my surround sound receiver.I like how the free samsung BD player interacts with the TV.  Very convenient.  Turn the DVD player on and the TV is set automatically to optimal settings for the movie.  3D is great, however, I notice a glitchiness with the glasses.  I think they placed the transmitter on the TV in a awkward place but this doesn't affect me much.  Is it worth getting a 3D TV?  WHY NOT FOR THIS PRICE?Just letting you know, I bought this TV in July/August timeframe and you couldn't beat the deal.  I stayed away from LED-LCD TVs because I wasn't planning on putting up the TV on a wall.  I could have gotten a rear projection, but that's just plain silly.

I'm pretty critical of picture quality, but after the burn in period and calibration, there was little to be critical about. Blacks are deep, colors are rich and vivd. You really do get what you pay for here.My only complaint that isn't serious enough to take away the 5 star rating is that there is a directional buzz in front of the center part of the TV, audible from 8-10+ feet away from the TV. Make sure that this TV is wall mounted a few feet above ear level and you won't ever hear it. For those who mount it lower, though, it may be a problem.

Having the volume up pretty loud helps get your mind off it, as does just trying to pretend it's not there.  Of course if your furniture is positioned in a way that your head won't be lined up with the panel that helps too.Aside from that I really was impressed with the digital features including streaming support, youtube, etc.  Speakers are pretty poor compared to a home theater setup, but that's to be expected.

I spent about a month going to local stores asking about different TVs and what they offered and reviewing different TVs online. I spent a week or so looking at every review I could find about these Samsung plasmas. I saw a couple people had issues, but usually it was with a different size. We decided to jump and not look back.....Now we're looking back.....We got it mounted and wired up after a few days. It worked for about 20 hours. In the first 20 hours we watched Avatar with some friends and it was awesome. The next day my husband and I were watching a dvd and cleaning at the same time. We walked through the room and the TV was fine, then came back through about 2 min later and the TV was black. We could hear the sound coming from the internal speakers of the TV (in ceiling speakers were not installed yet) but could not get any picture to show up. We tried other inputs (old dvd, VCR, etc.) but nothing gave the TV a picture. The menu screen would also not appear which is what the samsung technical support said to try to test the video. Needless to say we were pretty disappointed in this $3000 TV and in Samsung. We thought their products to always be good quality. We put in a ticket to have it fixed. After jumping through some hoops....faxing in a receipt, registering the model# and talking to samsung support, we had a ticket waiting to have it repaired. The repairman seemed to know exactly what the problem was before coming to inspect the TV and said it is one of the most common repairs. The y and z sustain boards had to be replaced. It took about a week and a half for it to be completed and everything seemed fine.We went along for a month and a half assuming it was just a fluke; then came the next repair. The TV developed a horizontal dead line of pixels. This looks like a thin black line all the way across the screen. The day after the line of pixels appeared, we also started seeing a green screen for a variety of seconds ranging from 15-60 seconds when we would load a dvd or Netflix. We submitted another ticket for repair, but were doubting that this TV was going to last the 5-10 years we were hoping. One would think if you spend $3k on a TV, it should last at least 5 years....even in todays standards. The repairman (same company) came out again to inspect the TV and determined it was the panel. The whole screen had to be replaced. We weren't sure how we felt about continuing this TV experience, but decided to just wait and see how it turned out. We were called about 2 weeks later and told that the part was back-ordered for the long term. They explained that this meant it would be at least a month or up to 6 months. I, of course, asked if the warranty for this part would start over when the part arrived since the screen is a major part of the TV; they said no. They refused to give any kind of extended warranty at all.  They said they can exchange or refund the TV since the part is back-ordered for so long. Once they found out we bought through Amazon, they said they do not contract with Amazon and could not do an exchange.  We decided to do the refund and end this TV disaster. They took awhile to process this and called back a week later to say that the part was now available. Can you guess what we did?? We still went with the refund. We last heard that the refund check was mailed a week and a half ago, but have not seen it yet. They will be picking up our TV next week. By the way, since putting in the last repair ticket, the TV has developed 3 MORE dead lines of pixels. Not good!When it was working, the picture was great, even in fast moving scenes. The internal speakers were fine, but we also have the TV recessed into a built in bookcase and it might have helped push the sound out. We did eventually put in surround ceiling speakers and it sounded 100 times better. The TV did buzz slightly (as I suspected might happen), but only if you stood in one exact spot. We could never hear anything from the couch which was about 10-12 feet from the TV. We had all wires running through the wall and into a closet to the side of the family room. We used a Logitech 890 remote and it worked great with everything. We ran everything through a Denon receiver using HDMI cables. Let me know if you have any questions.We are now very anxious to buy another TV, since we thought Samsung was a good quality company. They are standing by the warranty without much resistance however, so that says something. We'll see what happens.

Seems silly and a waste of shipping and time, why couldnt they just send them, they have a record of me buying the TV.. Anyway, they picked my 58\" up two weeks ago now and still have not given me my money back, kinda pisses me off, that $2,000 in limbo. I think in the future, I will not be making large purchases from amazon due to the crappy customer service is lag in returning my money. Its worth it to spend a bit extra in a box store and know if you want to return something you can with out a big hassle.OVERALLThe tv is awsome, so bugs but no show stoppers. Amazon has awful customer service and should be avoided when making large purchases, even if they are a bit cheaper, piece of mind is worth the extra money to buy some place else, that would be \"best\" to \"buy\" from. :)UPDATE:8/4/10 - Got my money back from amazon. So, from the day the TV was picked up from my house, till the time I got my money back, 17 days... not cool. I also noticed today that the prices have jumped upward quite a bit on the amazon web site for samsung TV's, pretty much on par with anyplace else.UPDATE:10/7/10 - TV is still amazing. Just wanted to mention that the ghosting issue I was having in 3D movies appears to be the movies themselves. I just watched Monster House and saw about 10 seconds of ghosting in the whole movie, so it seems like it has to do with how the 3D movies are made and not the TV.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Derth of movies that can be viewed on this 3D TV.", "Author": "DJG", "ReviewID": "R11ET0R0UZW7SO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is hard to believe that no one else leaving a review has mentioned this: I have had this TV for one year and the only 3D movie I have seen is the kiddie movie 'Monsters and Aliens' about cartoon monsters. None of the movies from Netflix like Hubble 3D or Piranha 3D or Step Up 3D have the actual 3D feature on them. They have a 3D like depth and quality but there won't be anything leaping off the screen like it does in the theaters. Even Avatar 3D is not in 3D unless you get it with the purchase of a Panasonic 3D TV.Excerpt from [...]:\"Avatar\" on 3D Blu-ray may not be available in general release for another year, claims a report from T3 magazine.According to U.K.-based tech publication, Panasonic confirmed that it has exclusive selling rights to \"Avatar\" on 3D Blu-ray through February 2012. After that, the film will be made available for general release.Assuming that's true, consumers will have to leap some serious hurdles and cough up some serious cash just to get their hands on James Cameron's blockbuster on 3D Blu-ray. That version was released exclusively via Panasonic on December 1.Currently, Panasonic is offering a copy of the film in its 3D Full HD Ultimate Pack, which also includes two pairs of Panasonic 3D glasses. That bundle sells for $399.95.Consumers can also opt to buy a Panasonic Viera 3D HDTV VT series or GT series set, which comes with the 3D Full HD Ultimate Pack. Panasonic is also offering a free copy of \"Avatar\" to people who bought one of its 3D sets between March 10 and November 30. To tap that offer, customers must fill out a mail-in request form.It's worth noting when Panasonic launched its \"Avatar\" offering, a company representative wouldn't tell CNET how long it had the exclusive rights to sell the film.If \"Avatar\" on 3D Blu-ray isn't made available until 2012, though, it will have another blockbuster to contend with.In September, LucasFilm announced that it will start showing 3D versions of the \"Star Wars\" saga in theaters in 2012 with the launch of \"Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom Menace.\" Reports claim LucasFilm will then premiere the rest of the films in chronological order by episode each year after that. There is currently no word on when those films will be offered on 3D Blu-ray. (My comment: Probably YEARS from now).Yes the TV picture is fine (sound really sucks, MUST use costly external speakers.) I am sure the 3D works just fine, it worked great in the stupid 'Monsters and Aliens' film that came with it.  So the moral of this story is I paid probably $1500.00 to $2000.00 more for a 3D TV and the only movie I can actually SEE in 3D is the above mentioned children's film.Please BEWARE you are paying ALOT of money for a feature that is TOTALLY USELESS.Oh and yes the Samsung 3D TV will convert 2D to (a wierd version of 3D), but not the version where things actually Pop out of the screen.
