I would have loved to have bought a Samsung or Sony, but they were out of my price range.  I didn't want to cheap out with an Olevia, Septre, Element, or other \"off brand.\" After reading more user reviews than I could handle, I finally started going to local stores to actually \"see\" the TVs in action.That's when I found this JVC 32\".Its picture quality was comparable to the  Samsung's and Sony's but for hundrids less.This TV displays rich blacks with very little gray washout. No ghosting trails to speak of, and sweet bright color.You may want to adjust the brightness because the default setting was a little dark for my tastes.The menu allows you a very good degree of control over the picture, though I wish I had more control over the Gama instead of several gamma presets.  No biggie though.The thing I love most about the TV is the digital tuner.  All new HDTV's have a digital tuner, so maybe this is nothing special, but I LOVE it.I don't have cable, but through the antenna on my roof I get a TON of digital channels in really clear quality.  To see and HD broadcast pulled out of the air from one of the major stations is just INCREDIBLE.One thing that may annoy some is the TV's \"boot-up\" time.  When you turn the unit on, its a good 10 seconds before you get a TV or DVD picture.  Not a biggie for me though.One time the unit did \"freeze\" on me and was non responsive to remote or button commands.  I unplugged it, waited for 5 seconds, plugged it back in, and it was fine.  That does scare me though as I've only have the unit for 1 month.This unit makes my Xbox 360 games look Awesome (no motion blur issues), and my DVD's look great, though I now want an HD DVD player, since I've had a taste of true HD (Yum!).The sound is really good for such small (hidden) speakers, and the unit has an audio out to send a signal to my surround system.No VGA or DVI port, but I hook my computer up via an DVI to HDMI cable (bought here on Amazon for less than $10) and the picture is hugely awesome!Why only four stars and not five? Well, the 1 \"freeze\" really scared me though nothing like that has happened since, no VGA input, & boot-up time issue. This unit is GREAT but not Perfect.I really do recommend this TV for anyone who wants a high quality picture from a name brand, but can't afford to fork out a Grand for a TV.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV for great price!", "Author": "Pawel Jurczyk", "ReviewID": "RWT5J3811OE6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for amazing price of $500 (really nice sale :) ). For this price, I am very satisfied with the quality product I got. Image is nice and crisp. Especially HD programming - it is just awesome. The only minus I find is that the TV lacks VGA connector. If you have older computer (e.g. it does not provide DVI connector), you have to use S-VHS connection... However, for this price, I can live with that!", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great picture!  Easy to set up...", "Author": "Elizabeth A.

In looking for a new tv, my search criteria included price, size, quality, and ease of use.  I found the JVC on Amazon in the size I wanted and at a reasonable price.  Since I liked my old tv so much, I decided to buy another JVC.  I haven't been disappointed.  The new TV arrived well packaged and in great shape.  I had spent literally days working with my old tv trying to make all of my theater system components work, so I was familiar with how everything should be hooked up.  I had this tv hooked up to my satellite, vcr, dvd and receiver within 1/2 hour.  It was so easy and has plenty of hookups for anything you'd want to add.  The picture is great and the setup is easy.  It took a little getting used to waiting for the picture to come on, but I'm used to it and it's worth it to get the beautiful digital pics.  I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a well priced, easy to use, high quality tv.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "High Resolution W-XGA (1366 x 768) LCD\nD.I.S.T. 770p (Digital Image Scaling Technology)with GENESSA Picture Processing\n32\" 1366 x 768 Flat Panel LCD with ATSC/QAM Tuner, Dual HDMI Inputs and Photo Viewer", "Name": "JVC LT-32E478 32-Inch 720p Flat Panel LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41u-acKp3sL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000NWARE4"}}
