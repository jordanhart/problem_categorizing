I was skeptical at first of buying an offbrand TV but the options for 12 volt TVs are very limited.  You can't beat the price and the picture is outstanding.  So far I've only used it for about 30 minutes.  I use it in my camper using the 12 volt cigarette lighter socket connector that is included with the TV.

I was originally looking for a 24 inch computer monitor and realized I could get this TV with HDMI input and have additional inputs including HDTV (ATSC) over the air and sound for the same price as other manufacturers are charging for just a 24 inch monitor with only HDMI input and no sound.The sound is very comparable to that of most portable TVs I've owned in the past. Perfectly acceptable for the news and other programs with primarily speech content. For movies and other theatrical type uses, I plan to connect directly to audio outputs of the video source (Patriot Box Office, XBox etc.).

Why sell a 12 volt Tv with no way to power it? I unboxed the TV and was ready to install and watch movies with the family on the boat, only to find there was no way to power it off my batteries.

Works well with DVD player and Iphone using an Iphone-HDMI adapter.  Lots of connections in back. Sound is acceptable, but works great when plugged into motorhome stereo system.

Long", "ReviewID": "RP602AZW8VRB0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this July 16, 2013 and within 4 months is showing a dead pixel. At least this is what I think it to be. I only see it on a dark, black type of background. This has daily use at home.Mainly, this was for my small 15' trailer hooked to a Jensen multi-use-player 12v. I found the installation of getting the player to work with this TV no easy task. I came to understand component vs composite or one into the other is challenging. You can't just take the normal yellow, red and white and plug into Supersonics green, red & white inputs on the bottom, which was the only way I could get a picture. It must go into the yellow ports on the side of the TV, not the bottom and menu button called (source) changed to component. Unfortunately with Jensen still in the stone age offer no better inputs other than y,r,w. Jensens support just pointed the finger at Supersonic.The great side of this story is; Supersonics support help me fix the issues within a couple emails and right away. Also, Supersonic developed the TV so it could be used in a variety of ways supporting 12volts for campers for which I'm grateful.The downside, when connected to component the picture is OK but nothing like hdmi cables or blue-ray but the audio will come over the natural wired speakers of the stereo, dvd unit or whatever's in the RV. If you only get audio from the TV, you might be a bit disappointed, like others have noted, sounds like a transistor radio I had back in 1965, which was very cool at the time.Since I'm blind in one eye anyways, the dead pixel and (eye) are getting along with only slight hurt feelings. I'm just glad to have something for the camper. The issues above had many folks pretty upset on some RV forums without knowing the fix.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does not receive ANY channels", "Author": "gerardo v brinkman", "ReviewID": "R3CPPTCY97TKZW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV for the bedroom in my RV; I have NAXA TV in the living room.

The picture had horizontal noise on all inputs, so I returned it.  The seller was apologetic and promptly E-Mailed a return authorization.  My refund was also promptly processed.When shopping for a 12 volt TV for an RV, there aren't many choices, and they are often more expensive than a comparable 110 volt set.  I have found, however, that several of the smaller 110 volt flat screen sets actually have a DC input and use an outboard transformer to step down and rectify the voltage to 19 volts DC. 19 volts just happens to be the input voltage for laptop computers and there are 12 volt adapters for them.  I just purchased a 26 inch LG flat screen with DC input for $199 at a local electronics store, and the wattage is the same as my laptop, so with my laptop's adapter, I have an AC/DC set and the store didn't even realize it!", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does Not Include 12Volt Lighter Socket Power Cord", "Author": "lifeisgood71", "ReviewID": "R86H0ZR4YJRU0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was excited to receive my Supersonic SC-2411 12 Volt AC/DC Widescreen Full 1080p HD LED TV w/ ATSC Digital Tuner.

I wanted a TV that consumed less power and that I did not have to use a power adapter to go from DC to AC.Upon removing from the box I opened it to look at the contents.  Needless to say, I was disappointed to find that it did not come with a 12Volt Lighter Socket Power Cord.  However, it is corded for a 120V and comes with an AC/DC converter.  Not sure why it comes with AC/DC converter when it is already corded for 120V.

It will not tune in much outside of this range even with the most advanced indoor antenna.
