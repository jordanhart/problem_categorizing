Pombrio", "ReviewID": "R2GO1TD84NZHUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Heh, first time I have used smelly in a review, but this set DOES run warm like another poster said. For the first week, this made the set have a high temperature electronic type smell in my bedroom (with door closed). Gone in a week tho. With a 1080P source (Blu-Ray), the picture cannot get any sharper. This high resolution for a 32\" is probably overkill but DANG its good! There is just a ton of pixels. Upscaled 1080P DVD look just about as good as high def because of the set's smaller size. Standard TV signal looks fine (again in comparison to my larger SONY XBR 40\").  Controls are good and simple to understand and operate. First time I have had extra HDMI slots. Sound is very good though the built in speakers but needs more bass (as does all my LCD TV speakers). Has a lot of extras that I have yet to fool with or notice. Motionflow? DMeX? The set is very handsome with a surprising gap between the bottom of the TV and the top of the speaker bar. Very good base keeps the set solid on the table.A winner!", "Date": "May 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great display for bedroom applications!", "Author": "Michael Davis", "ReviewID": "RVD33ZO8LSJX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Normally I wait a few months before giving any sort of review on high ticket items such as this telvision simply to give time for issues, if any, to surface.(See my review of the KDL-52XBR4). But in this instance I already know I have a great piece of hardware and feel no reservations about writing so early on.I have had this television for about three weeks now (purchased online via SonyStyle) and I love it. I bought the XBR model simply becuase it harbors most of the same things my larger KLD-52XBR4 model does. Namely, native 1980x1080p resolution, Bravia 2 engine, a myriad of controls for in depth picture calibration, numerous HDMI unputs, etc.Initial setup is a snap, as the television asks simple questions with regards to language and region, what type of signals it can expect to receive, and what other components, if any, should it expect to be connected to. Once set up the tv works like any other. SD programming looks pretty good since it's a smaller panel, and HD programming shines given its native 1080p resolution. Since I purchased this for the bedroom I only have a Sony upscaling DVD player conected to it, but I am utilizing the Bravia Sync feature and I love it. All I have to do is hit a button on my remote, select the device I want to use, and everything I need for that device turns on. This translates into not having to get out of bed. The speakers are great for a set this size regardless of the output setting you choose.As far as cons, I don't really have any to list. After reading some of the other reviews I can't verify the 'smelly' review, as this tv doesn't run hot for me at all. I have it mounted on my bedroom wall, so it's possible that the placement of the tv with regards to surrounding items/cabinets/armoirs might make a difference. Also, please note that contrary to what the features checklist (above) states, this television does in fact have Sony's XROSS Media Bar (3D on-screen feature navigation). I don't know why it states otherwise, but it leads me to think that maybe the checklist was released prior to Sony's new line of smaller tv's for 2008.All in all, this television is great and works perfectly as a bedroom set. It saves tons of space when mounted to the wall and has plenty of connection options for any device you might want to plug in. The remote is nice, although I wish it had a backlight feature like the one for my XBR52 does, which makes for easy navigation in low-light situations.I agree that while this television is priced higher than other telvisions in its size class, it is completely worth it for all the options it comes with. Some might argue that 720p for a panel this size is fine, but once you have 1080p it's hard to go back, and this is the only television currently offering a native 1080p resolution for its size.

It is hooked up to a Charter cable HD box which provides a 1080i signal. The HD picture is fabulous and the regular digital pictures are also quite good.

According to the display the movies are being upscaled to 1080P. Other than adjusting the picture: vivid,standard,cinema,custom or trying the different \"wide\" settings, we have not yet tried any other adjustments.

Built in HD QAM tuner.  Good speakers.  Mounted to the wall easily.  Great picture quality for HD sources.  Nice user interface.  As soon as I turned on the TV for the first time, it asked me for my language, time and date, zip code (for the TV Guide listings), and scanned for available channels.  This took about 20 minutes, and found dozens of new digital channels that I didn't even know I had on my analog cable system.  It automatically tunes the HD channels, for example channel 7 is standard resolution (480i) while channel 7.1 is the HD version of the same station.  I recommend it.Cons:Okay picture quality for low-def sources, like standard TV signals, much worse than a CRT TV.  No headphone output (contradicting what Sony and many other merchants claim on their websites), so I had to get a cable and a signal booster to connect my headphones to the RCA audio outputs on the back.  When pressing the channel up or down button on the remote to get to the next channel, there is a noticeable delay of 1-2 seconds while it tunes the signal, an annoying delay that I did not encounter with my previous television.  Does not have a dual tuner, so the picture-and-picture (PAP) can only show a TV signal on the right window while the left window can have any other input, like the VCR or DVD.  I needed to split the cable signal to have one line going to the TV and another line going to a VCR in order to have the PAP display two TV channels at the same time so I can channel surf during commercials.  There is no PAP button on the remote, so you need to navigate through the system menus a bit to enable it.  The free TV Guide on the TV is a nice feature, but it frequently displays no listings or the listings are wrong.", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Brand new, already in love", "Author": "S.

Plugged the HDMI cable into the cable box and into the TV and presto! beautiful picture. Have now had it in place all of 30 minutes, and I can't think of a bad thing to say. 480 cable looks fine. 720 cable looks good and 1080 looks amazing.

Viewing angles are good, not as good as a plasma or CRT TV but better than most.  As you get to the side, you do start to lose contrast, but the picture is very viewable and when I say get to the side, I mean at least 45 degrees to one side or the other.  You can get confused going through the menus on setup, but once you're through them, it's fine and you can go back and forth easily.  I do like the menu layouts and the use of the options button on the remote to get to the most useful.  I just use the build in speakers, and the sound is great.  The simulated surround sound is quite pleasing.  The hookup to my VCR/DVD/DVR (1080p upconverting) was simple....one HDMI cable and it's all ready to go.The TV Guide interface is my one complaint.  The interface itself isn't so bad...but the TV guide data is horrible.  I get off the air TV in the Denver area, the TV guide, when properly setup, shows multiple different stations on EACH channel!  So if you don't put the proper station at the top of the list at each channel....the information shown on screen as you change channels is wrong.  In addition, if you hit the TV Guide button, you get an overload of listings.  If you turn off any one of the multiple listings for each individual channel...it turns off the channel from being selected.  This is mostly TV Guide's problem, not Sony's but the 'turn off any one listing and you turn off the whole channel' is Sony's problem.Bottom line....I am VERY pleased with the TV, I would buy another one in a heartbeat and would strongly reccomend it to my friends.  I tend to be a perfectionist about skin colors and color saturation (to me, most people set their TV's with the color control turned up way too high) so the picture looks natural.  I was not disappointed in this TV in this area.  For me, it takes a lot of back and forth between all the various options...but the end result is as close to perfect as I've ever seen in a LCD based TV (or computer screen for that matter).I believe the additional cost over Sony's similar 32\" 720p (KDL32L4000) set is worth the extra money.

I thought prices would be going down!The price I paid was STILL $400+ cheaper then at Best Buy & Frys Electronics!! ($1,200+tax) here in the San Fernando valley near Los AngelesThe Sony picture is perfect. No complaints at all about it. You can create a custom picture you like or go with the defaults. Under Options> Picture Adjustments there are many settings you can adjust. I bought the 32\" model because it is the equalivilant of the 26\" tube tv's in height. TV uses 160 watts. The speakers are very good. 0-100 and I set the volume at 20 or so. 100 is very loud. Plenty of connections to hookup more speakers.The tv has a built-in tuner so you don't need a cable box if you don't want one. The Sony has Coax, RCA, S-video and 4 HDMI connections. I bought a 3ft $25 HDMI cable that hooks up to my cable box. Others will insist that you get those expensive ones at $100+ while others say you only need the $5 ones.You can view 480-720-1080 resolutions. The high def channels at 1080 will make you think you are there in person when the show has been filmed well. See the Travel channel and National Geographic and Discovery etc. I swear I could reachout and hit Paulie and Mikey and old man Teutul on 'American Chopper'  : )The 480 resolution looks better then any tube tv. The 720 better and the 1080 is what I wish all tv channels were like.Easily switch between inputs like your cable box or the vcr/dvd player. Push the Input button on the remote or top of tv and select the one you want. You can tell which has a connection because it has an arrow next to it.The remote is lightweight. Just wish the Mute button was larger since I use it a lot. If you are using a cable box you will use their remote.The tv channels switch quickly when you have the coax plugged directly into the tv. If you use a cable box and a HDMI cable however there will be a 1-2 second delay as you change channels due to that $#@!&%! DRM (digital rights management) that checks if you are looking at copyright material. It slows the changing of channels way too much.It is the cable box that is slow and not the tv set.A workaround is to use the RCA connection.

It's bright, sharp, and I definitely concur with all of the other positive reviews about it.  However, my low rating is more a reflection on Amazon and other websites that continue to \"cut and paste\" their product descriptions either from previous year model specifications or from really flawed research.  In purchasing a new TV, the 3 criteria I had was LCD (Plasma is great but a real drain on electricity); 1080p (we have HD satelite and a Sony PS3/blu-ray); and last but probably the most important for me was 120hz capability.  If you look both on this site and on sites like ZDnet or CNET, they all describe this as having Motionflow (Sony's version of 120hz) which dramatically reduces judder.  I know that some people don't find the \"sopa opera\" effect all that appealing, but I really like it for some things and wanted it for my next TV.THE SONY KDL-32XBR6 DOES NOT HAVE MOTIONFLOW/120hz.I've researched the forums and because of coflicting reporst (some coming directly from Sony Technical Support) I know that their is still debate on whether it does or not.  I've concluded that it DOES NOT.  I've spoken with Sony's tech guys...they say it doesn't. Their website suggest from an ommission of this specification on their product description that it does not.  And finally, I've spent the better have of a month renting Blu-Ray after Blu-Ray trying to replicate the 120hz \"look\" and have not been able to do it.  I've played with settings on both the tv and my PS3 and their is nothing to indicate that it has Motionflow.  It does have Cinemotion which is definitely NOT Motionflow.  Even the manual for the TV idicates that only their new \"W\" series has Motion Enhancer which activates Motionflow (even this isn't entirely accurate because I know that some of the other larger XBR4, 5 and 6 models do have Motionflow.Anyway, as I said, this is a non-essential feature for some people, but it was a major reason for me choosing this model, and I'm now extremely irritated by Amazon for posting misleading product information.With all of this said, I am still satisfied with the TV for all of my other needs.  The PS3 games and movies look beatiful, and I've seriously become spoiled for HD (it's actually pretty jarrig to go back to standard definition when switching to non-HD channels).  Would I still recomend this TV?...yes but as most know, Sony relies heavily on its name recognition which allows them to hike up the price point of their stuff.  I would certainly look at Samsung's LCDs as well.  Just as good (if not better) and usually marked $50-$200 less.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture and color saturation.

The picture is so clear I noticed the newscaster on my local news needs to cut down on the pancake makeup.  It looked like he applied it with a trowel. My only complaint -- and it's minor --  would probably be that the 32 inch screen seems a tad too small when you're viewing a non-HD broadcast reduced to the square picture format.  (We got the 32 inch model because we needed it to fit into an existing entertainment cabinet.) Someone else complained online that the set smelled like hot plastic when they first used it.  Mine didn't and I'm someone who notices things like that.  As for the picture quality, the pre-set picture options are well-calibrated and personal adjustments are easy to fine tune.  The remote is a bit large but not a big deal.  The colors are true and vibrant.  The blacks are pitch black, including the \"pillars\" that come up on the left and right side of the picture when you are watching a non-HD picture (I made that my preference because I don't like to stretch or crop a non-HD picture to fit the wider screen to avoid letterboxing).  Both HD roof antenna picture and HD DirecTV look great on it.  Free delivery of the TV took about a week and the shipment arrived in pristine condition.

Even with backlight adjustments, they seemed too dark and muted. The Vivid setting was much brighter, but garishly colorful, as others have noted.  Then I remembered comments I had seen in some reviews of larger Bravias: complaints about dark and dull screens, and fortunately, the solution.  The sets are equipped with a light sensor (or \"autodim\" function) that adjusts the screen brightness based on room lighting.  But the formula seems to be way off.  I suspect it's designed to be at full brightness (up to what your setting allows) only in a brightly daylit room -- otherwise it darkens up.  At any rate, I disabled the light sensor, and the difference was dramatic: a beautiful, vibrant, natural-looking picture in Standard mode.As I mentioned, the TVs come with the light sensor on, so if you already own one and have never experimented with the setting, do yourself a favor and try it. Unfortunately, it's not as quick and easy as a button on the remote, which there should be.  The procedure is in the back of the manual:  Press \"home\" on the remote; go left to \"settings\" and down to \"general setup,\" then down to \"light sensor\" and choose \"off.\"I've had the set for a few days now, and so far it's been terrific. On some points that are often discussed:1) I was a little worried about the screen \"clouding\" problems that seem to plague Sonys (I returned a 32S3000 last year because of clouding), but so far at least there's been no hint of it at all.  The picture, colors and contrast are all excellent. As someone else mentioned, the side pillars on standard 4:3 inputs are nice and black.2) The internal speakers are quite good -- obviously not a home theater system, but natural and balanced sounding.  If by chance you're wavering between the 32XBR6 and the Samsung LN32A550 (another 1080p 32-incher), and the TV's internal sound matters to you, the Sony's speakers are much better. (No, you cannot make the Samsung sound as good by adjusting the audio settings.)3) The viewing angle is not bad for an LCD, but color does start to wash out a little at about 30 degrees.  You can still see a fairly watchable picture at an acute angle, but it will be a lot less vibrant than head-on.  If viewing angle is critical to you, consider the third option in the 1080p 32\" field: the Panasonic 32LZ800. The Pannys use a different type of LCD screen (IPS-Alpha), and the off-angle viewing is really remarkable -- like a plasma or CRT.  Both this Sony set and the Panasonic get top ratings from Consumer Reports and from owners.  In my case, 95% of my viewing is straight on, so I opted for the Sony's fourth HDMI input and its slightly lower price.4) Motion smoothness: If you've been researching this size set, you probably know there's currently nothing under 40\" with true 120hz, though there was some confusion about that with early descriptions of the 32XBR6.  So far I've noticed no blurriness or motion artifacts with HD sports or nature broadcasts. But aerial scenes of running herds on a Planet Earth DVD showed definite \"juddering.\"  However, that was a conventional DVD in a Sony up-convert player, so maybe a Blu-Ray version would do better.So all in all a really nice TV.

Henson", "ReviewID": "R27F0E0K70FVR8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Sony TV has an amazing picture.  My setup is with a standard over the air antenna - and the HD programming is great.  I found the set up to be easy and the menu system intuitive.  I have not yet connected the TV to a Bluray Player, but the standard DVD is very good...I can only image the Bluray to be even better.  While this is a great TV - there were two items I encountered that are worth noting.First, this TV (at least the one I purchased) actually has a software update that is available.  You can download that from the Sony website (which I did not do...but it is my understanding that you can download the file, save it onto a USB memory stick and then load it into the TV).  I called Sony and they sent me a USB stick with the file on it.  I did this because I was already on the phone with them trying to figure out how to fix a TV guide issue I was having...which brings me to the second item.Second, the TV Guide information was not working correctly.  And I have noticed that several others have posted with the same issue. I was able to find a solution, really a \"work around\".  Now - I apologize for the detail to follow - but if someone else has a similar issue - hopefully this will help them resolve it.  (By the way, I had contacted Sony technical support several times about this issue and they were not helpful in resolving it...they tried, but I think the problem was one they were not familiar with.)  Back to the TV Guide - it was showing I had all the program listing data for 2 days into the future...however, there were actually too many channels.  More specifically, the TV Guide was showing up to 3 entries for the same channel with different programming schedules for each.  So for example, we have a local digital channel \"4-1\" and there were three entries for \"4-1\" with three different schedules showing.  I have had other TV Guide equipped units - so I knew that inside the TV Guide system (under set-up / change channel display) there was an feature called \"Channel Editor\".  This is where the channel information can be \"turned off\" (or hidden).  So, I \"turned off\" the two that were incorrect - no problem...however, when I went back to view the listings - all three of the entries for channel 4-1 were missing.  Umm.  Back to the \"Channel Editor\" and I noticed all three channels were now turned off...so I \"turned-on\" the one I wanted.  Back to the Guide Listings and all three channel 4-1's were once again showing.The following finally provided a solution that works...  Inside the \"Channel Editor area (which again is access by selecting the TV Guide, Set-Up, Change Channel Display) on the right side it calls out the channel number that the station tunes to.  On my TV, there were three \"4-1\" channels showing.  So I changed the two channels that I knew were incorrect from 4-1 to channel \"4\" and then moved I moved to the left side of the screen and \"Turned Off\" that channel.  Then when I returned to the TV Guide Listing - only one \"4-1\" channel was showing and it had the right programming information.  It works great now.So overall - great TV!!

I have noticed 1 dead pixel but really it doesn't change the viewing experience AT ALL.  Also, not sure if this is common, the screen gets quite warm after being on for over an hour.  I have mine in a cabinet so it's of some concern to me.  I hooked up my pc via DVI to HDMI and it looks great, only problem is I haven't gotten the screen to fit properly with all the different resolutions.  Overall you will not be dissapointed if you purchase this TV.  In my opinion it is well priced with the MSRP of $1,199.  Of course if you get it off amazon it will be about $100 cheaper.  I personally had a great experience with Remonstores.  I don't think I'll ever watch TV without the 120hz now because it just adds a new element.  It gives the picture a 3D effect.

The TV menu (if you like the PS3 styling) is wonderful and currently supasses most of what is on the market.4.

The TVs internal software is updatable with a USB stick there is one update available at the time of this review, very neat feature.6. The built in TV Guide feature is amazing with listings for almost every channel, it will tell you whats on and whats next with many search features (need not apply for those of you with cable boxs)7. Many inputs and ways to select them very simple and easy to use.8. The TV will dim/adjust the screen brightness based on the lighting in your room.Issues noticed:1. The TV will create a \"new plastic odor\" when turned on for the first couple weeks however this is not an issue for most people since the smell is not too strong and is that of just plastic.2. The software runs a tad slow and will lag minorly but is well worth it for its capabilites, also the TV takes a few moments to load.3. The TV will give off a slight hummmm while turned on this can be very irritating in a quite room.4.

A friend of mine had an old CRT Bravia TV and I remember the picture was outstanding. It stuck with me, and now looking for a new TV Sony was on the list. Some people love Sony, some say it's over-priced junk but, I fall in the middle. I care about value and performance and that is it. I have been following this TV since it was first released but, waited to buy it till about two weeks ago. I purchased it from the local BB as it was on sale.First off the picture is really great. Some newer reviews I have read on forums complain this TV doesn't have colors that \"pop\". I have an 42 inch Panasonic plasma that is almost five years old and the color is and has always been very solid. This TV takes it to the next level. It is hard to describe but, to me the TV had that \"just right\" look. Nothing unnatural but, very vibrant. The blacks are certainly black enough for me, and the contrast in dark scenes are very detailed. Another note about the picture...eveness. It may be a weird term but, sit tight. I have seen a friends LCD TV and when going from source to source the color would change. Nothing was connected with less than component cables and even with that the sources would not be consistent within themselves. It was something I found terribly annoying. The 32XBR6 has no such problems as everything looks super sharp.I have a Direct TV HD receiver, X Box 360, and Playstation 3 plugged into it via HDMI. Having four ports is very handy as this is going to be the prime digital format going forward. When I first brought it home some HD channels had the \"sparkle\" effect going on. It would be when panning across a scene like following a basketball and looking at the crowd or something similar. It really bothered me once I noticed it. So I go online  and look for \"32xbr6 software update\" and, sure enough, it forwarded me to the Sony support site with software recently upgraded.After a simple download I transfered the new software to my thumb drive (which had numerous other files on it) and plugged into the USB port on the back of the TV. Seven minutes later after a series of reboots the TV was set and the problem was gone! Since then I can not say how impressed I am with the set. It blows away my Panny and made me a believer in LCD after being convinced I was a \"plasma guy\". One last thing I'd like to note is the \"variable out\" for audio. I have powered speakers and a powered sub set in the bedroom. It has a dial on the front for adjusting the volume with no remote or other way to adjust it. With the Sony set, I have it plugged in to the \"Audio Out\" and the TV remote(or programmed DTV remote) controls the volume! Sound is excellent due to the digital amp in the TV, and having adjustment controls including mute made me flip! I guess sometimes its the small things that make the difference.Again I can't recommend this TV enough. I have played numerous games like MGS4, Killzone 2, Assassins Creed, and the quality is amazing. Blu Ray at 1080p/24 has to be seen to be fully grasped. Direct TV looks fantastic as well. The ability to upload any future any enhancements to my set within 10 minutes is the icing on the cake.

I tried a number of set-ups to achieve this and found that buying a DVI to HDMI cable ($20 here on amazon) is the best solution, and the quality is, near as makes no difference, the same or better than a standard monitor.  The TV does require a little bit of settings-fiddling to get the screen to fit properly, but it only took a few minutes of digging through the immense properties menu.  Also,  you have to make sure your video drivers are fully up-to-date, and there may even be additional HDTV drivers to download, depending on the make of your video card.To anyone looking for an HDTV-computer monitor solution, I highly recommend this TV and the DVI to HDMI cable.

I came to the conclusion that... the Pioneer Kudos plasmas were the best, but too pricey. The Panasonic plasma and Sony XBR LCD were my next two choices. I finally decided on the Sony, but was disappointed to learn that the size I wanted wouldn't fit in my entertainment center. So I bought a Panasonic Viera TH-46PZ85U for the family room and Sony Bravia KDL-32XBR6 for my son. Both are beautiful TVs with excellent picture quality. You can't truly appreciate them until you connect a high definition source like HD-TV or Blu-ray. I love the Sony, because it weighs less, has a less reflective screen, a more user friendly menu and sharp bright colorful picture. The Panasonic's picture on the other hand is warm and natural with life like flesh tones, deep blacks and excellent colors. Neither TV has very good sound, but that's easily remedied with a home theater system or a less expensive sound bar (I'd recommend the Sony HT-CT100). I'd go with the Sony if your TV will be in a brightly lit room or a room that receives daylight from windows. Go with the Panasonic if your TV will be in a dimly lit room and you're looking for a more theater like experience.
