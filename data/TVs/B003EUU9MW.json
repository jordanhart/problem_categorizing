{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Didn't like the picture quality - returned it", "Author": "Tom in Sacramento", "ReviewID": "RG1NGG0I8TFFG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, let me say that I am a big fan of Sony products. Our main TV is a 55\" Sony KDFE55A20 that has the best HD picture I have ever seen - from any viewing angle. Second, I have a background in broadcasting and photography, so I am very, very picky about TV picture quality.I saw this set go on sale at my local Costco and purchased it immediately. After the initial setup I tuned to a 24 hour news station, and did not like the look of the skin tones and other colors. The faces looked a bit washed out, pasty, and slightly cartoonish - and a real disappointment from my 55\" Sony.I went online and read many review of other LCD TVs. The general consensus was that LCD screens can look a bit washed out when viewed from side angles.I spent two days playing with the picture controls and got the images to look, well, OK, but still disappointing, compared with my 55\".So, I went back to Costco and spent a LOT of time comparing the display Sony to the other 32\" TVs there, and particularly liked the Panasonic (TC-32LX24). I watched both TVs side by side as they cycled through various programming, and the Panasonic seemed to produce better flesh tones. In particular, when the Sony was viewed from the side, the colors faded, but when the Panasonic was viewed from an angle, the colors remained clear. The Panasonic says on the box that it is designed so as to produce a viewing angle of 178 degrees.So, I purchased the Panasonic and set it up, then turned it on, ran through the initial setup, and right out of the box the flesh tones were fantastic, the other colors were great, the image was sharp and had great contrast, and it looked perfect from any side angle - there was no washout effect when viewed from almost a 180 degree side angle!I was really, really stunned. This \"out of the box\" picture wasn't just a bit better than the Sony picture that I had been working on for 2 days, but was MUCH better.The Sony TV was a bit better looking, the stand was easier to set up, the on screen menus were a bit classier and easier to use, and yet the picture was a disappointment.I would rate the Sony picture as OK, but disappointing, and the Panasonic picture as fantastic, when viewing the same picture source.I also compared both viewing a DVD - same result - the Panasonic blew the Sony out of the room.Also, the Sony speakers sounded cheap - the Panasonic speakers sounded better - fuller.As I said initially, I am a big Sony fan and have always thought their TVs produced the top of the line pictures, but no more.If you have not yet purchased a TV, I suggest you go to a store and view both side by side, then look at them from a side angle. You will see that the Sony picture washes out and the Panasonic picture stays sharp and clear.I returned the Sony to my local store and am really enjoying the Panasonic.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV and easy to use", "Author": "S. G. \"s.g.\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZZQDL38YZZJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last year we replaced all the TVs in our bed and breakfast. We bought 4 different types figuring we wouldn't be stuck with 8 lemons that way. The Sony is definitely the best of the 4. When I say best I'm not talking \"nerd-speak\" about pixels, HD, surround sound, et cetera (although I DO think the picture is great). What I mean is, can the average person figure it out to watch TV or a movie and is it tough enough to handle the careless handling of hundreds of guests. We've had the TVs for about 8 months and so far they are both working great.By \"ease of use,\" I mainly mean whether or not the customer can figure out which buttons to push to go from one input to another. This one is a no-brainer and we've never had any 10 pm calls from a guest asking us to show them how to use the TV.I suppose the one thing that could be better is the volume of sound. Whenever my husband and I have watched the Sony TVs we've noticed that we have to turn the volume up almost all the way.This TV is a workhorse and I'd recommend it for anyone who just wants a nice, solid TV with a great picture.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "bummer", "Author": "Cattlelady \"sheep too\"", "ReviewID": "RM1UDYYUG70R4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "19 months, and it's got a bad board. Almost a 300 buck repair so it's not worth it.Picture was acceptable in all that time but sound wasn't good and I had forgotten how bad it was until I rehooked up an old Panasonic TV.Suddenly today it had the effect of a rolling screen, but it was the image jumping up and down the screen with ghosting. Talked to authorized repair center and they advised the board was shot and was 174 for the part and about 100 bucks for labor plus I would have to drive it there and drop it off. 4 hours of driving... nah.That's the last Sony I buy.", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice 32\" LCD TV", "Author": "H. Torres \"Multimedia Lord\"", "ReviewID": "R1V39AW3729SRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I've been using this LCD TV for a few days and the image and sound are really good. I got it for $349 in a warehouse club and it has a resolution of 720P but I am using it as a second TV since I already have a 46\" LED SONY BRAVIA. I mainly purchased it to hook it to an Apple TV and the image looks nice. It comes with 18 months warranty and 4 HDMI inputs and one RCA input (very rare feature in recent LCDs but useful to have it for older equipment). I turned off the ambient light sensor and it gets brighter and it also lets you choose the cool, vivid, standard or warm image type to improve the image colors for better viewing. I like this LCD TV and I hope that it can work 3 years at least with no problems.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV image and sound", "Author": "Ricardo Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R1FW6M4FRD6EX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this after returning samsung tv with great picture but horrible sound.
