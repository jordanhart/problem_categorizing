The picture quality is fantastic. This is a NeoPDP panel (single pane of glass)The panel thinness is still amazing to me. A screen this big and this thin looks crazy.The sound is surprisingly good... the included speakers are also extremely thin. Not huge bass, but still very good for TV speakers.The wireless feature is nice... especially for those who want a wall mount installation. You still have the option to use an HDMI cable from the separate tuner to the panel, if you like. I am using wireless, but on a stand. The stand has glass shelves. I have the tuner component on a lower shelf. Line of sight between transmitter and receiver, for the wireless, seems critical. This may be since I have the receiver almost directly over the transmitter.The Viera Cast is nice, except I haven't been able to get the Amazon-On-Demand to play anything. It logs in and I can access content... nothing plays. I have contacted both Panasonic and Amazon... twice and have not received a comment from either. You Tube, Picassa, Weather Channel and Bloomberg all work well. Viera Cast could be a very nice feature if they can add more content... Vudu, Hulu, Netflix, etc. would be nice.The THX picture setting option has a yellowish hue... this seems to be inherent in the THX settings that Panasonic is using.ProsPicture qualityTHIN screenConsPrice (although I did get this well below MSRP)Amazon-On-Demand doesn't play (has been corrected by firmware update see below)2/4/10I contacted Panasonic about the inability to stream Amazon VOD content. They were able to replicate the same problem on a TC-P54Z1 at their facility. Panasonic kept me posted via e-mail about their progress with this issue. A few days later, Panasonic tech support issued a firmware update that corrected the problem. Amazon VOD content now streams through Viera Cast.

I can't believe I own a Z1. I was looking to buy either a Plasma or LED TV in the 46-50\" range. Originally was looking at the Panasonic V10's and the Samsung c8000 LED's. I liked the performance of the Plasma & the looks of the LEDs. I was NOT looking for 3D TV's, but that's what corporate is pushing in their higher end units-I was quite frustrated by their market research and product direction (fad). The Z1 was in the upper stratosphere of price and quality, royalty really; I knew about it, but had no hopes of ever joining its inner circle. There was no way I was paying $5K for any TV. So I bought it (more later on this).This is an amazing TV. It combines the performance of Plasma with the aesthetics of an LED. It's just about 1\" thin. It is only available in 54\". The side mounted speakers add about 2.5\" per side to the unit. Set-up time is just about 1 hour. Back-end connections are straight forward. The \"controller\" is not integrated to the TV (that's part of why it can be only 1\" thin), so there is a separate \"tuner\" box that connects to HT and to the TV and to the remote receiver (it is a wireless remote, not IR-so you don't even have to point it to the TV, but you do need to register it to the TV). I have only hooked up through fios (1080i) so I have not tested the tuner's HD over the air function. The unit exhibits no sunlight glare or vieweing angle issues.Viera CAST (IPTV)is pretty cool - got to see my Picassa slide shows, Stream HD movie from Amazon VOD, YouTube videos, Bloomberg, etc. - easy set-up and navigation - the unit even updated to latest firmware version- I wish I could add my own app's and content I like, both public and private. Also, this concept (IPTV) is not quite there yet by these manufacturers. Some of the data entry is cumbersome on the TV remote-better concept would be to have a registration site where I could manage content and accounts online as well. SD slide shows ran smoothly from the SD card directly from my Canon PS, but not from my Nikon DSLR (5MB ea photo). SD detection was automatic.  HD movies are....phenomenal...on this unit, be it camcorder, DVR or BlueRay. Sound output is fantastic on a 7.2 AVR home theater set-up. I haven't spent too much time (yet) on THX and I haven't yet played PCHD TV fed from PC through the TV.This is a phenomenal TV. It is last year's model and I am ok with that. It lists for $5K. IMO, it is not worth the list price. For $1700 you can get this unit on Amazon now. At that price it is worth every penny. The TV has much better performance than the new 3D TV's out there today in that price range and above. You'd be hard pressed to find a better TV at this price. It is a beautiful unit.This is a phenomenal TV. It is last years model and i am ok with that. It lists for $5K. IMO, it is not worth the list price.

I have had this TV for 6 months now.  It has an amazing amount of great features and the picture quality is amazing.  Nothing bad to say.  I don't get the people who are complaining about the detachable speakers, they are the best sounding 1' deep speakers you will find, and you cannot compare them to an aftermarket sound system, it's just sense.  Panasonic made them 1' deep so they would not affect the slim profile of the rest of the TV.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "S'OK", "Author": "Les", "ReviewID": "RASEXPLOYK6LT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Television did not work right out of the box.

I started off my search for a 50\" plasma to upgrade from my old 2006 42\" Panasonic. I had great luck with my old one , so I wanted to stay with Panasonic. After doing tons of web surfing and reading review after review.  I settled on last years model panasonics V10.  None could be had new. Heartbroken, I went back to see if there was a model above the V10. I found it to be the Z1.  I took a shot at going 4\" bigger than what I thought I needed. I am very happy with the size of this TV. I am eleven feet away and find it very comfortable viewing it from this distance.  I now feel that a 50\" would have been too small for me.  After calibrating it using what cnet.com found to be ideal settings the picture is so lifelike. Very deep blacks with no floating blacks like my old 42\".  This TV has come down so much from it's original price of $6000, it's a steal.  BTW, if you're looking to mount this on your wall.  This set is perfect at only 1\" thick.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "TJ", "ReviewID": "R1CCHWVVLLO5FB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv at the end of 2010 for our family room and was sold due to the price and the fact it was the top of the line for the 09' year.  It is actually better then the V10 with regards to construction and single sheet of glass, better AR filter and the WIRELESS 1080 AUDIO / VIDEO.  Fast forward to 2012 and this has been a rock solid television for our family.Pros:1\" thick and solid constructionBrushed metal finish, look at CES 2012 and you are seeing this againSingle sheet of glass constructionAmazing AR filter to block reflectionGreat blacks and amazing picture.  Jaw dropping HD and Blu Ray.Speakers are fantastic for something this thin, but you don't have to put them on if you don't wish.Wireless video / audio delivery is flawless.  We have it beaming full 1080 through a cabinet top or 4\" of solid wood.  NO OTHER CABLES!  This to me was the biggest selling feature for me.Easy to set up, and great support about some questions from Panasonic.Cons:NONEIf you can get this tv at the price point we did then this is a bargain for a cutting edge, top quality product.  Couldn't be more happy.  This is my second Panasonic from Amazon.  Ordered the G10 in 2009.

I guess I should have read the fine print. Instead of the infrared controller that works directly with the TV monitor there is a wireless remote control that communicates with a separate tuner. The tuner is the size of a DVD player. The only way to operate and control the TV monitor is with the tuner plugged in. If you try to connect a DVD player or receiver directly to the TV you get an error message, \"No Tuner !\". The remote only works with the tuner connected. Through trial I found that a Panasonic will work directly with the unit but there is no remote control and no way to adjust the picture.There is a wireless option where the tuner will transmit the signals to a receiver on the TV. Unfornunately like all wireless connections the result is not very hi-fi and the link can pick up interferrence and cause interferrence with other electronics. Plus, it doesn't work through walls.If you have a separate room/closet to house your electronics then obviously the tuner will have to housed there. Now you have the problem (as I encountered) that the wireless remote doesn't work (same problem as with the wireless link).The outrigger speakers have poor sound quality and look funky. 54\" Plasma 1080PIf you are able to locate the tuner near the TV, don't mind the extra cables and are not planning to use a high end receiver (separate amp and speakers), then no major problems. Mounting the unit on the wall means cables hanging down the wall.Panasonic have made a major error by not providing a standard interface option.If you are looking for a plasma monitor for your high end home theatre, then this unit is not for you.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "54-inch Viera Z1 Series Plasma\n1-inch Ultra Thin Design\nWirelessHDTM Connectivity\n600Hz technology lets you view superb full-HD motion and still images with 1,080 lines of resolution\nTHX reproduces movie images exactly as the movie's creators intended them", "Name": "Panasonic TC-P54Z1 54\" Plasma 1080P", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41F8t0T9-1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002DKQ09U"}}
