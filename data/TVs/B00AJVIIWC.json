{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better deal than smart TV !", "Author": "Griffen Yu", "ReviewID": "R2K98Z0C6UREDH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking to upgrade to a 3D TV, read a lot of reviews, pros and cons on the active vs passive 3D, etc. Finally came to the decision for passive 3D, and was able to narrow down my options to just two LG models: the LM4600 or the 'smart TV' LM6400. Both are 120Hz LED, and both have 3D. Spec-wise, they are almost identical. The only differences are, LM6400 has WiFi and the Magic Remote, while the LM4600 has only LAN connection with a conventional remote.I tried the Magic Remote in a local store. It's nice. Much like a Wii remote. But Wii remote has a very big flaw. If you own a Wii, you'd know it. It drains battery like there's no tomorrow. I asked the sale rep how long the batteries last on a Magic Remote. He has no clue.Smart TV can surf web and has many built-in 'Apps'. At home I already got my desktop hooked up to my old LCD TV w/ wireless keyboard & mouse, so the web-surfing feature has little concern for me. For the 'Apps', most of them I don't use. The only one I do is Skype. So I asked the sale rep does the Smart TV has a built-in webcam? \"Nope, you gotta buy one separately.\"Then can I use my PC's webcam with the Smart TV? \"No, you gotta buy the LG's webcam specially designed for the Smart TV for Skype to work. It runs about $100~150 a piece.\" Well, screw that...How about WiFi? Hmm, that's an useful feature to have. If I don't surf web on the TV, what do I need WiFi for? Can it stream 1080p movies over WiFi? Hmm, I think I'd rather stream HD movies over wired LAN to be safe...My local store sells the 47\" LM4600 for $600, and the 47\" LM6400 for $750.Last weekend I brought home the 47\" LM4600.Now I'm watching some IMAX 3D movies I found on the web on my new TV, streamed thru the TV's DLNA via wired LAN, and it works perfectly. Couldn't be happier with my new TV.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG is always the right choice", "Author": "mlk18", "ReviewID": "R3NRL0LGMW48KC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my current TV died I began an exhaustive search for a replacement. I looked online, read reviews, went to TV stores, talked to friends, interrogated several electronic store clerks, went back to TV stores again and checked numerous consumer complaint websites. Here's what I came up; picture quality and quality control are everything when you are looking for a new TV. I want the image to look great and I don't want the TV to die the day after the warranty expires. And those two criteria lead me to LG. According to my research (especially talking to store clerks) the LG brand has less problems than anyone else, including Sony. According to my eyes LG has the best picture quality (hence the 13 trips to a variety of electronics stores). In the end the 47\" LED/LCD 47LM4600/4700 fit my budget perfectly without any gimmicks like WiFi or smart features (which adds more stuff to go wrong). And I can tell you I made the right choice. The image quality is amazing, the sound is good enough for even a larger room, the functionality is just what I needed, the remote is solid and the price was perfect. I have no complaints about this TV and expect it to last me a long long time.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first 3D TV", "Author": "Robert C", "ReviewID": "R3OHUDCVGXB8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the LG brand, I also have a LG LCD TV and it has been great, now it is in the bedroom and the new one takes its place in the living room. We use it for tv and movies, and it is great. I don't expect perfect fluidity out of a $599 dollar TV but it looks good even when the action gets fast. The blacks are BLACK and the color is GOOD! I don't need smart TV because of the great 3D Blu ray player that has all the apps I want for $100. The sound is pretty unimpressive but adequate for watching tv and we use the stereo when watching movies, I am a realist so I don't expect a thin TV with a small bezel to be able to house speakers that will produce sound that will satisfy an audiophile like myself. I wish LG would put a RCA audio out on their TV's, other than that I love it.Update: I have owned the tv for a few months now and at first found the 3D to be pretty bad, but once I updated the firmware, downloaded to a USB from the LG website, it is awesome! The images don't really come out of the TV much but the depth is amazing, its like you could just climb in through the window.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "An awesome TV that has made me a fan of LG", "Author": "G. Denick", "ReviewID": "R34WP4LW3J6IUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV for sale when it was only $550 delivered, and it was a steal. Even at its suggested MSRP of $799, I think this would still be a five star TV. I'm very picky when it comes to HDTVs, and I've owned at least a dozen of them over the past several years. If I have even the slightest qualms about a TV, I simply return it- they're too expensive to keep if I'm not completely happy with them. This TV passes my high standards.Picture quality is bright, sharp, and without blur. The fact that it's not \"real\" 120hz does not bother me in the slightest, because I always set my TVs to 60Hz refresh rate, anyway. Why? Because when the refresh rate goes beyond that, the dreaded \"soap opera effect\" kicks in, which ruins programming for me. I like my movies to still look like movies, not soap operas. I've been told that faster refresh rates can enhance sporting events, but I've yet to notice this difference. I think the blur (or lack thereof) simply comes down to the quality of the unit and the standards set forth by the manufacturer.As for aesthetic design, this thing is very well done, and I love its super thin design (1.4 inches), something a lot of manufacturers have oddly been veering away from, even as they deceptively tout their TVs as \"LED\" (technically, you can have a \"fat\" LED, but this is in direct contrast to what consumers have been led to believe over the past three or four years). The bezel is thin and looks sharp, ditto for the base. Assembly took about three minutes, and the ports are easy to reach. Three HDMI ports is MORE than enough, and much appreciated (though I do own a 32\" TCL with five). If you need more than that, you should perhaps look for another TV.I'm not a fan of 3D, and I basically never use it. But the 3D does work remarably well with this TV, if you like that feature. Also, it includes four sets of glasses, which is a nice bonus.Sound quality is very good for a flat panel TV. I don't have it hooked up to any kind of speakers, and it's plenty loud. The \"Clear Voice\" is a great feature that makes dialogue easy to hear. You can certainly get better sound from a receiver, but for average people like me, this thing is great, even at less than half volume.One word of warning: the screen is rather reflective (I think this may have something to do with the 3D), which is not an issue for me, because of my particular setup. But if you think it might become a problem for you, steer clear and get something with a matte finish.In conclusion, this is an awesome TV (especially at $550) that has made me a fan of LG.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing quality!

I'm not a videophile, but it meets or exceeds all of my expectations. Not a smart TV, but I don't care. My PS3 and soon, my PS4, are more than sufficient for doing anything a smart TV can do.Added features I appreciate are : base lets the TV swivel 15 degrees either direction, comes with 4 pairs of passive 3D glasses, and the on board speakers sound much better than the Vizio and Toshiba flat screens I've had before.The only thing that I dislike is the lack of an analog audio out, since I have an older stereo system I'm not ready to give up on yet. I had to order a digital to analog converter and an optical audio cable to make it work.

I orginally bought the tv in Dec 12 from another dealer. The tv was not used for a bit of time for several reasons, none of which actually had to do with the tv. About a month and a half ago I set the tv up...if I was to review the tv at that time I would have given it 4 stars overall due to some backlight bleed coming from the lower right corner as you look at it. I figured I would just deal with it..but after a month or so I got really annoyed by it so I called LG hoping they would fix it under the warranty. To my suprise, they were all over it. Two days later a contracted service tech showed up to assess the problem. It needed a new panel. About a week later, the new panel arrived and the bad one was replaced. LG customer service was GREAT!!! Now the tv looks great especially after setting the colors. It was easy to set up, the picture and colors look very good. I haven't tried the full 3d yet due to my lack of 3d content. But I did try the 2d to 3d conversion and it does work. I can't say it was great or even good, but it does work ok. If I ever get some 3d content I'll update the review with that info. I provided this review because this is a very good product especially for the price and my pleasant experence with LG customer service. So should you get a bad one, no worries because LG stand by their products (at least for me).", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWSOME TV", "Author": "Maxine M.

I had to do a little legwork getting this purchase, they were all out at the store and the closest one in stock was In Downtown Houston, which by the way closes at 7pm?! my wife and I are in Humble and it was already 5 pm.I was<< very excited about getting this TV to upgrade older 2008 Toshiba Regza 42\" LCD.Main reason getting this TV was for gaming PS3 BLACK OPS and for 3D movies.Since getting this TV I have been going thru the 5 stages of Grief:Denial:  I can't believe I wasted my money on the wrong TV.Anger:  Damn Damn Damn..where's my punch bowl?Bargaining:  Well maybe if hadn't already thrown away the box and mounted it to the wall I could return it, or then again maybe I can get those colors to come in right.?Depression:  Almost...almost, so close.. just my luck....\"We seem to be made to suffer, it's our lot in life.\"Acceptance:  It's not too bad..I still got a good deal on a reasonably up to date, low energy consumption 47\" LED TV with 3D for $600 but again it's not what I was expecting.I have a Vizio 32\" smart TV with 3D and I will tell it's just as good if not better and the ol' 5 year old Toshiba has better color.There's horrible glare on the LG.You can't adjust settings while you are on PS3, so u have to input HDMI back and forth from adjusting colors on one screen only to see there not right on another..and yes u get the annoying Do u want to turn on 3d now, put ur glasses on and sit 2 meters away notice.The Tv speakers break up and loud sounds distort on a volume level of any more than a setting of 25.The game setting is slippery; scrolling and sliding crosshairs with uneven transitions,gameplay is better on any setting but.The 3.40 update doesn't seem to do anything. ---Damn : (There's a certain amount of fuzziness that just won't be adjusted away. (Is it the special 3d film on the screen I have read about?)The colors on the factory settings lack vibrance and depth, no matter how much adjustment they just don't come out right...I have been messing with the settings for about a week and half. As one reviewer wrote on another forum, \" The factory settings lack color and you end up jacking up the color only to have brights bleed out on to the screen..\" Don't get me wrong u can get color depth but the clarity obscures and u end up going in circles adjusting....I may be a little ocd but come on! :( We're all kicking ourselves in the butt trying to convince ourselves we can adjust it but in the end we know ...this relationship is going no where fast.....It's not me it's you LG47LM4600 Say again what's the definition of Insanity?: Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Bottom line I wouldn't buy this TV again nor recommend it to a friend.I am disappointed and have an unfavorable view of LG products from now on....ya hear me LG corp?Sincerely,  Not Humble in Humble  >>>>>>>>>>UPDATE JULY 3 2013<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<IMPORTANT UPDATE  Well about the worst thing that can happen after buying expensive electronics, it broke.After purchasing TV in March I had the \"Black Screen of Death\" visit my tv after only 3 months of light use.  I can honestly say I will Never buy another LG product ever.This Tv has been a real turd when it came to adjusting it's settings. The colors never and I mean never came out right, I adjusted the oblivion out of it and again with the word \"NEVER!\" got the right amount of red blue green , grass sky complexion hue contrast whatever...any one who owns this TV and says the color is great is either in need of an eye exam or a complete tool and doesn't know image quality..they probably think the backside of baboon's @ss is pretty to look at..that being said, u can get nice vibrant color but the quality of color that this tv can produce is suitable only for cartoons or maybe a NatGeo special on color depth of a Baboon's @ss. The colors as said before will \"bleed out\" and obscure the natural hues when adjusting them. The best thing about this TV was and I do mean past tense \"was\" the price.  The technician who came out to repair tv had to come out twice, the first time he came out he brought a new main board, which he said 80% of the time is the prob with a no power on. It needed a new power supply unit. when asked about the top TV brands, he listed as:1) LG2) Samsung3) Sony  ..........I would say hell no on that.Stay clear of this TV model, I cannot damn the whole lineup of LG TV's but I can Damn this one. PUNCHBOWL SMASH !!! OK after my technician fixed TV I no longer have Picture Wizard ??I did update TV via internet to 03.40.09...to update go to settings>customer support(red square button) Anyways I would like to share my recent settings that I am satisfied for this TV. Take note, I still stick to my statement: \"there is a certain amount of fuzziness that won't be adjusted away, Colors bleed out on the screen and what this TV is best suited for is cartoons or maybe a red headed step child gaming TV.SETTINGS:STANDARD USEREnergy saving OFFBACKLIGHT  OFFCONTRAST  100BRIGHTNESS  62SHARPNESS  78COLOR  100TINT  0COLOR TEMP  0ADVANCED CONTROLDYNAMIC CONTRAST  OFFDYNAMIC COLOR  OFFCLEAR WHITE  OFFSKIN COLOR  0NOISE REDUCTION  OFFDIGITAL NOISE  OFFGAMMA  HIGHBLACK LEVEL  LOWMOTION EYE CARE  OFFREAL CINEMA  OFFCOLOR GAMUT  STANDARD These I believe are the best settings this TV can offer.
