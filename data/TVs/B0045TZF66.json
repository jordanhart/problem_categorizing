When my Samsung 46\" DLP bit the dust (CPU) a few weeks ago, I wanted to replace it with Samsung 46\" LED 3D set, but could not fit it into my wall unit or into my budget.  I came across the Vizio sets in Costco and bought this set the day they were unpacked onto the shelves.  The 42\" fits perfectly into the 42\" wall unit.  The fact that it had speakers on the front of the unit and most plasma and other flat screens I looked at did not, also was a big plus given my space was a 3 foot deep box meant for a traditional TV.  I actually returned a Panasonic and LG set of the same size for that reason.The extra $500 for this set was well worth it for the additional features that I use today and will use in the future.  I bought it for the 480hz refresh rate and the built in WiFi and Bluetooth radios as well as the compatability with my wireless N router.  It streams HD Video almost instantly with no buffer pauses at all.  The universal remote/keyboard with bluetooth connectiviity is also a big plus. Setup was a breeze.  My only complaint was having to spend an hour or so adjusting the picture settings to get the color and brightness just where I wanted it.  Sound quality is good, but hooking the Digital Optical cable to your stereo makes for a very high quality experience.  The Internet Apps are great.  I hooked up my Amazon, Pandora, Netflix and Facebook accounts  in a matter of minutes and I'm really impressed with how it handles them.My only real complaint is the lack of ACtive Shutter 3D glasses.  The Real  3D ones you get in theaters do not work on any 3D broadcasts from DirecTV and I\"m not about to spend an additional $200 for the Active Shutter ones to play with that technology.  In a year, when it's more prevalent, I know I'll have a BluRay player with 3D titles and I also know Vizio supports all known 3D standards out there right now.A great set that keeps getting better with each day of exploration.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesomeness", "Author": "JasonC", "ReviewID": "R2DSJ69DR8A7Y2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off let me say I have been looking at 3D tv's for a long time work with computers everyday and have an extensive knowledge on the technical aspects of any piece of hardware. This TV is truely bang for your buck. The refresh rate being at 480 pretty much future proofs your set and you can rest assure any format updates for hdmi or 3D technology will be able to be provided via firmware to the set. I love gaming and if you are a gamer like me that wants to expierence an awesome no ghosting picture on xbox 360, pc or ps3... I have sent this tv to the ringer and it has come out like Tyson in his prime. 3D will be availiable to this set through vudu which is full 1080p@24hz similar to current bluray players. All other formats are supported (like the ones you get from cable or streaming over youtube or downloaded videos and soon to be netflix.... these are usually called SBS or side by side, this set also supports over and under which is just another format of SBS all these formats are used in games or cable programs and the set performs top notch here keeping the resolution in HD range due to active technology.)To sum it up this set is at the top of the 3D market for a few reasons.1) Active technology running on 1080p@24hz as of now is the only tech that give you a full 1080p HD picture with no loss where passive interleves the picture cutting the resolution in half and this is a no go for most gamers.2) Active SBS technology takes that same 1080p signal and splits the images into two angles then recombines them to give you still an HD signal but closer to 720p than 1080p but has become the standard for most cable providers, netflix, youtube ect. due to the bandwith it saves. If your set is SBS passive then i feel bad for you cause you have 2 forms of loss happening now the first splitting that 1080p signal into two images then the interleaving for 3D effect..... giving you close to a 540i signal.3) LED TV!!!! And not only led but full array led. This means your blacks are darker and your colors are more defined crisp and sharp. There are litterally red green and blue leds in your set that can now illuminate to help the color portfolio of each pixel on your screen. Top of the line in LCD technology.3)PC 3d gaming can be done either by nvidia's solution or ATI HD3D and iz3d drivers. Nividia's setup is a bit simpler but performance is lacking and usually you have to scale the graphics down for the framerate to pick up. I've recently updated my video card to the ati HD 5670 and could not be happier. First off you will want to get the iz3d driver and make sure you chose the full install of the release canidate. Purchase the AMD 3DHD license which is half off. Make sure your LCD is connected via HDMI and in the catalist control panel select the 1080p@24hz resolution and scale it to 0 overscan. Enable the iz3d driver and you will be well on your way. Any other refresh rate will work great on the tv under normal circumstances but it needs to be running at 24hz to use the amd HD3D features.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vizio - I'm a believer!", "Author": "Andrew S. Prihar", "ReviewID": "R1O0CVJ1EG288A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, well here goes.  I've had this TV now for about 5 full days (got it right before Labor Day Weekend).  Ordered it off Amazon and paid $3.99 for PRIME One-Day Shipping (This is NOT one of those TVs that Amazon has special delivered through a TV delivery service as it is super-thin and light [<50 lbs]).EASE OF SETUP [9 out of 10]Pretty easy TV to setup.  I am using it primarily as a computer monitor, however the PC I have plugged into it has Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray 3D, and TV Tuner functionality, plus I'm playing a few PC Games on it, so I consume a pretty wide variety of content on this TV.  The boxing was very well thought out.  The boxing?  What?  Yeah I know its a weird thing to mention, but Vizio has a really neat box for all of their TV's (my Uncle bought a 55\" Vizio last year with a similar box).  Basically, you stand the box upright, remove four black tabs from the box, and then the entire box, with the exception of the base, just pulls right off.  Then you can remove the styrofoam from the TV and you're good to go.  No having to make it a 2-man job and having someone hold the cardboard box exterior while you tug a snug-fitting styrofoam shell out of the box.  None of that crap.Got the TV out of the box.  I didn't wall mount so I can't speak to that.  Installing the base was a sinch.  Just slapped it on (it did take a wee bit more pressure than what I would have imagined) and used the provided thumbscrew to secure the base to the bottom of the TV.  Then, I just propped it up on a table (I live in a college dorm, so no room for an entertainment center), plugged in the standard power cable, and was just about good to go.  That's where I hit a little snag.For some reason, I wanted to try it out by DIRECTLY plugging it into the cable first (my university uses a direct ClearQAM via Coax distribution system.  No set-top boxes) instead of just plugging in my computer via HDMI and using my computer's TV Tuner.  Vizio clearly intended to make the wall-mounted experience as seamless as possible and, as such, the ports (both HDMI and Coax) on the TV face DOWNWARDS (so that the cables can run PARALLEL to the TV, not stick out a few inches perpendicularly (which would be problematic for some wall mounters)).  The only problem with that design is that the little indented area where you plug in the cable isn't very large and, as such, you have to use pretty flexible cables otherwise it'll be a PITA to plug them in.  Well, the only coax cable I had sitting around was an old stiff one.  Add to that that it was the style that you have to screw in, as opposed to just pushing in.  I literally spent 15 minutes trying to screw in the coax cable but was unable to, as coax cables need to go on straight - an impossibility with a stiff cable and the small caveat where the cables are plugged in.  So I decided to forgo the direct coax hookup and just use my computer's tv tuner via HDMI.  I had a few non-rigid HDMI cables, and was able to get those setup without issue.  I just want to warn that if you have very STIFF cables, you might run into some issues plugging them in the COAX and HDMI 1-4 ports.Once I got the computer plugged in, I turned on the TV and was able to whiz through the basic setup.  Most of the setup steps didn't apply, as they were meant for setting up cable boxes or direct COAX connections or the like.  For me, it was pretty much just (1) turn the TV on, (2) switch to HDMI 1, (3) boot up the PC.  Once I got the PC booted up, I noticed that there were ~1.5\" borders around the visable computer screen area.  I was able to remove these and blow up my desktop to the entire area of the visible TV by adjusting the Size and Position settings (Hit MENU, then TV SETTINGS, then PICTURE, then MORE, then SIZE AND POSITION).  That was when I was running my ATI RADEON 5770 Graphics Card.  Strangely enough, I upgraded my graphics card to an EVGA NVIDIA GTX 560TI later that day, and then I only saw a portion of my desktop on the screen.  At first I thought that something was wrong with the graphics card.  But then I remembered that the image on the ATI was underscanned and I had had to compensate in the TV Settings.  Sure enough, I reset the Vertical and Horizontal Size and - voila! - the desktop was the perfect size again.  I also tested my Apple TV and Xbox 360 on this TV and their pictures are perfectly fit to the TV on default settings.  So, basically, only SOME older graphics cards will have the issue I explained, and it can be easily remedied.Finally, I noticed the image seemed somewhat dark.  Not unwatchable (at least by my standards), but bothersome.  I remembered something I'd read about Vizio's Ambient Light Sensor, and went about finding where I could customize that particular setting.  After I turned it off, the picture was damn-near perfect (To turn Ambient Light Sensor OFF, Hit MENU, then TV SETTINGS, then PICTURE, then MORE, then ADVANCED PICTURE, and finally hit ENTER once you get to AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR and choose the OFF option).  The brightness level seemed good (some may want to increase the Backlight and/or Brightness options just a smidge still; these can be found in the basic PICTURE settings; I ended up doing this myself).  The image really needs no calibration after you turn off the AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR IMHO.PICTURE QUALITY (2-DIMENSIONAL) [10 out of 10]The nice thing about this TV's brightness/color settings is their FLEXIBILITY.  I was sitting on the couch with a couple of my roommates, and we each found a mix of color and brightness settings that we liked.  My one roommate prefered it with more color, the other with less color, and I prefered it with a smidge more color and a bit more brightness.  If you're super-picky or whatever, you will probably be able to find a mix of settings that you love - it might just take a while.  But, this TV looks GREAT almost right out of the box.  The LED backlighting really does make all the difference.  I have an LCD TV/monitor (about 1.5 years old, 24\", Samsung, pretty nice monitor when I got it) in the other room, and going back and forth between the two was like night and day.  The LCD appeared overly dimmed, and its colors didn't POP.  The LED backlighting, far from washing out the colors as one might expect (since LEDs lead to higher brightness levels), actually enhance colors, making them seem naturally vibrant.  That's what I mean when I say that the colors POP.  OK, enough about color and brightness --- let's talk about the elephant in the room - the 480 Hz Refresh Rate.  Some insist that it's only \"really\" 240 Hz, but does it really matter?  I mean, the difference between 240 Hz and 480 Hz is invisible to the human eye.  Are you telling me that your eyes can tell the difference between frames flashed at it in 1/480th of a second (approximately 0.002 sec)??? Don't flatter yourself.  However, the difference between the Vizio's advertised 480 Hz and the 60 Hz of a regular TV, and the 24 or 30 Hz of a standard film and TV broadcast respectively, is quite visible.  Obviously, Vizio can't magically turn 24 Hz content into 480 Hz content.  But it can attempt to smooth the motion by \"guessing\" at the frames in between.  Noone can expect this to be perfect.  Typical movies are filmed at 23.976/24 Hz.  This TV has the ability to show content at 480 Hz.  That means that between every two frames of Hollywood film, the Vizio has to \"guess\" at what NINETEEN other frames would come in between.  And it has to do all this on the fly in a fraction of a second.  But I must say, the Vizio handles the job very well.  The question is not so much whether this \"Smooth Motion Effect\" WORKS, but moreso whether or not you like it.  Me, I'm on the fence about it.  For watching live action sports, or even playing games, I love it.  For TV primetime dramas, it makes the picture look a little too real, I think.  But I kinda like it in that application, depending on the TV show.  For movies, I generally don't like it.  There's something about the juddery-ness of film that adds to its genuinity, in my mind.  Others may disagree.  But the great thing is that, not only can you turn the \"Smooth Motion Effect\" on and off easily depending on your tastes, Vizio actually gives you a few options (\"off\", \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\").  Last but not least, the picture has great color uniformity.  Some may complain it isn't a FULL ARRAY LED screen, but I actually like the EDGE LIT LED screen, because EDGE LIT LEDs don't suffer from any image \"blooming.\"PICTURE QUALITY (3-DIMENSIONAL) [9.5 out of 10]First thing you gotta know about 3-D is this: if the 3-D image comes out looking bad on this TV, its more than likely a problem with the CONTENT that you are using, not the TV.  Certain 3-D video games, and even highly compressed or bad;y converted 3D movies WILL have ghosting.  What's ghosting, you ask?  Ghosting is basically when you see a faint extra copy of an image, kind of like a full-color shadow, while watching 3D.  For certain applications, ghosting can be quite annoying if it occurs.  For example, playing video games, especially shooters, where there is severe ghosting is tough - because it makes it hard to know if you are shooting the opponent or his \"ghost\" image.  Watching movies with high level of detail can be tough too, as ghosting can have the effect of making the image appear blurry.  The other thing about 3D --- a lot of 3D content cannot be shown at full HD resolutions or at full frame rates.  For example, 3D video games have a max framerate of 24 fps because of limitations in the HDMI 1.4a standard (this might get fixed via firmware update later on).  24fps PER EYE is good for watching film and for most gamers, but a lot of hardcore gamers feel uncomfortable playing a video game below 35-40 fps.  And regarding resolution.  Certain film/TV content (known as half-SBS content) that you can download from the Internet or watch on Youtube, is naturally going to be lower-res than its 2D bretheren.  That's because, when you have a 1080p half-SBS image, each eye is only receiving a 1920x540 image, instead of a 1920x1080 image.  Blu Ray 3D uses a proprietary technology called frame-packing to provide each eye with a 1080p FULL-SBS image, meaning both eyes each get a full 1920x1080 image.  This is one of the reasons why, if you compare Blu Ray 3D content to other 3D content (shown on the same screen), the Blu Ray 3D will be noticeably superior.  3D Blu Rays also tend to have less ghosting.  For the purposes of grading this TV's 3-D image quality, I used the highest quality 3D content only (in my case, a 3D Blu Ray for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition).  I could have referenced how half-SBS or gaming looks in 3D, but that wouldn't have been an analysis of the TV's performance, but rather an analysis of the current mediocrity of these standards.  The 3D Blu Ray looked superb.  Please note that the Vizio's 3D is not so much pop-out-of-the-TV-in-your-face 3D, but more of looking-through-a-window 3D.  There's a little POP, but not much (I tested using the NVIDIA 3dTV Play driver test image with 3d effect set to 100% and the image seemed to come out of the TV only marginally).  But I actually prefer this 3D effect to the pop-out 3-D effect.  This effect makes it look like there is a whole world inside your TV that you are looking into.  There is great depth INSIDE the image.  It reminds me of the closet that the Pensieve kids go into, only to find there's a whole freaking world in the back of the closet (Narnia).  Kind of like the whole freaking world inside my TV LOL.  The image clarity and 3D effect when watching a 3D Blu Ray is superb, and I didn't notice any ghosting AT ALL (though I did notice some while using lesser non-Blu-Ray-3D content).  The Vizio obviously can't make ghosting disappear from content where its inherent, but it doesn't create any unnecessary ghosting or artifacts in high-quality 3D content that doesn't have any inherently.AUDIO [9 out of 10]Well, its a TV, what can you expect?  Someone somewhere along the line got the idea that TV's should sound like they have a $300 surround sound system built in.  That's ridiculous.  If you want a 1200W speaker system, BUY a 1200W Home Theater Package, don't expect it to come out of your 2\" thick flat panel TV that cost $750!!  The Vizio's built in speakers are surprisingly good, though IMHO.  They are LOUD.  The highest level I've played them at is a 28 (out of 100).  When you turn the volume up, speech is crisp, and there is no crackling.  Does the Vizio make your house shake with bass?  No, obviously not.  However it reproduces sounds, minus the big-time bass, just fine for an immersive movie experience.VIZIO INTERNET APPS/INTERNET CONNECTIVITY/BLUETOOTH REMOTE [9.5 out of 10]Again, this is a TV.  The Internet Apps are a nice touch, but if you really want a hard-core flawless internet experience on your TV, hook up your computer or dedicated box (Roku, Apple TV, etc.).  Internet setup was a breeze --- pick your wifi network out of the list, type in the password, and you're good to go.  The TV will even automatically update the apps bar when you connect to the Internet for the first time.  The basic apps are pretty much Weather, Netflix, Twitter, Amazon VOD, Finance, Web Videos, and VUDU.  IMO, the vast majority of people will just use the Netflix/Amazon VOD features.  The Facebook App is well implemented - and I can see people occasionally wanting to update their status from the couch - but reading the news feed is a bit too cumbersome.  The Netflix and Amazon VOD apps are well-done, and WORK.  There are a few other apps you can download (like CNBC, which I like, and Soduko, which is also pretty good), but the Vizio App Library is overall pretty unimpressive.  The Bluetooth Remote however, is quite the opposite.  Reminiscant of a feature phone made for texting, the vizio remote control has a flip out keyboard.  It also has a nice form factor, not to long like some remotes, but not too wide nor thick either.  Its the perfect size remote IMO.  The one thing they could have done to make it better was to add a backlight but hey, you can't have it all.  Speaking more about bluetooth support generally, I think its a great idea.  I live in a dorm room with two roommates, and I think it'd be great to obtain a 3.5mm-bluetooth adapter and listen to my TV on my Beats by Dre when my roommates are sleeping or studying.  Haven't tried it yet, but intend to.STYLE [10 out of 10]Again, I have no idea what people expect a TV to look like.  LIke something made by Da Vinci?  You want Art, go to the Louve.  You wanna watch the game, go to your TV.  The Vizio looks plain, but classy, with an unobtrusive logo.  Not to mention, I'm proud to have the VIZIO logo out there for everyone to see.  If someone has a problem with me having a high-quality TV from an underrated manufacturer that actually keeps SOME of its jobs in the good ole U.S. of A. then they can just STICK IT!VALUE [11 out of 10]I picked up this TV for $750 on Amazon, plus $4 for ONE DAY SHIPPING.  No Tax.  Wouldn't have paid anything for shipping if I'd gone with 2-day, but, what can I say, I'm an impatient dude :).  Plus, I got TWO PAIR of 3-D glasses for $25 (normally $85-$125 on Amazon) as part of a promo for this TV (Amazon's been running the promo off and on the past few months).  So like $780 for the TV and 2-pair of glasses that got to me in one-day.  That's a superb deal.  If you want to get a good (120 Hz) non-3D 42\" Class LED TV, you're going to be shelling out around $700 already.  And, if you buy from a big box store in the good ole State of California (LA Area), you'll pay 9.75% sales tax on that AND a $10 monitor recycling fee.  So basically, if I would have bought an INFERIOR TV (2D vs. the Vizio's 3D, 120Hz vs. the Vizio's 480Hz, potentially no Internet Apps vs. the Vizio's Internet Apps, etc.) at a brick and mortar store here in LA, I would have ended up paying around $779 [($700 * 1.0975) + 10] anyway.  And, since I don't own a car, I would have had to inconvenience a friend to drive me to and back from said brick and mortar store (as I'm not too hot on the idea of lugging a brand new, boxed 42\" HDTV through the streets of South Central Los Angeles).  And when you compare the Vizio against TVs that are ACTUALLY IN ITS CLASS, that's when I really feel like I almost stole this TV.  You want something like this, with a close-to-equivalent feature-set from Sony, Samsung, or Panasonic, you'lll end up dropping more than $1K, that's for sure.  I'd estimate that the Vizio sells for $300-$400 less than what an equivalent set from the Big-3 costs.  And the Vizio has exceptional picture quality.  I don't see how you can top it, and I definitely can't see how, even if you could top it, you could top it by enough to qualify a $400 price premium.  Unless the Sony, Samsung, and Panny wake me up in the morning and serve me breakfast in bed, there is no way in hell that their price premium is justifiable.  No way.TOTAL SCORE: [68 out of 70] = 4.86/5 STARSVIZIO = EPIC WIN!", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Close but not perfect", "Author": "O.

Action scenes are very fluid, the colors are crisp, HD sports broadcasts are a crisp and clear. The internet apps are pretty neat, especially the twitter application which overlays the broadcasts you are watching so you can tweet without missing the action. The bluetooth remote is very convenient, however the lack of lighting on the remote makes it difficult to type in the dark. It is very light weight and very easy to set up with an easy to follow set up guide as well as on screen instructions to get you going. I bought this mainly for 3D gaming and it does not disappoint! Super Stardust HD in 3D is the perfect game to showcase 3D gaming. The glasses are comfortable, easy to use, but expensive. I'm hoping the prices drop soon as I'd love to have people over to watch ESPN 3D.I am very satisfied with this TV, but there are a few areas where it falls short. The best audio out method available on the TV is via Optical out. This means DTS-MA is a no go. I really wish Vizio had added an HDMI audio pass through on this TV. Screen glare is an issue with this TV; you don't get the best picture unless the lighting is behind the TV or completely off. The TV has 3 USB ports, but you can't use them. It would've been great if this TV had some sort of DLNA or picture/music/video viewer to allow you to stream movies or plug in a USB drive to show your media. Hopefully a firmware update fixes that, but I'm not holding my breath.Overall I'm glad with this purchase.

The picture looks great and it is a very feature-rich TV.  However, one of the TVs is notorious for shutting off and resetting itself after about an hour of viewing.After owning it for two weeks, I contacted Vizio customer service and was informed this was a known problem and it would be fixed shortly with a firmware update.  I decided to give them a chance to get this firmware update out to see if it resolved the problem.  After about a month of waiting for the firmware update(and living with a TV that loves to turn itself off and back on at inopportune moments)I contacted Vizio again.  I also informed them that the remote was periodically freezing up (controlling not only the TV, but other devices, too), along with the controls on the TV itself, forcing me to unplug the TV to shut it off.  I was given the same answer as before...  the TV is supposed to do this and there is going to be a firmware update to fix this with the release date unknown.I am very disappointed in Vizio's quality control and customer service in regards to this TV.  It is very apparent to me that there is something wrong with one of the TVs but Vizio does not feel that they need to address the problems in a timely manner.

The audio is great on the TV, I had purchased the VHT510 for the Magnivox and I almost don't need it with this TV, but of course still use it for the surround sound.

I do recommend that you have at least a 10 Mb connection if you decide to use the widgets, you'll have a much smoother experience watching Netflix and Vudu.

I called techsupport and the representative (American) was very helpful.  The solution was to reset the TV to the factory settings.2.  The AV hookup (red, white, yellow RCA cables) caused a lot of feedback that sounded like a humming noise.  This sound continued even though nothing else was hooked up to the TV (except the wires) and the RCA cables were bare.  The representative stated the sound should not be coming and the TV's connections were causing the interference.  The solution, register the TV, send a digital copy of the receipt to Vizio and they will have a technician to the house within two weeks.  Else, I could return the TV.3.  The Netflix Vizio aps does not contain a search by title mode.  The representative stated the engineers were aware of the problem, and the problem will be fixed in the next firmware update.4.  When you have more then one Vizio product, and you program the TV's universal remote, you loose capability of the original remote, and the functions of the universal remote changes depending on what Vizio device you are using.

I have seen the full array LED Vizio version of this model and it greatly improves upon this 42inch edge-lit set.(I would recommend purchasing the 47inch model in this series that takes advantage of Full array technology and shouldn't even be considered the same category as this model.) The local dimming seems to be somewhat over-active and truly does not help as much as I have seen on my Sony nx810. The one area where this set excels at is bright scenes. It has a fairly saturated color and looks better than any dark moments in movies where its flaws become too distracting for viewing. The 480hz processing does a fairly good job of smoothing out the picture but does introduce some artifacts and can often be very choppy in a detailed scene. Overall picture quality is about 3 stars out of 5.Sound Quality...Sound is a little above average on this unit mainly due to the fact its speaker bar is not hidden in the back like my Sony and Samsung. It can reproduce decent sound quality but as always if one were looking for the best I recommend a separate sound system any day. The sound gets 4 stars out of 5 when compared with similar flat-panels.Internet Apps...I am pleased with the format of Vizio's internet apps and the speed by which you can surf through various video services. However, the aesthetic look of the menus themselves cannot compare with Samsung's Smart TV applications. All in all it works good and streaming via wifi works great. I'll give the internet capabilities and VIA a 4 star rating.Design...Besides the horribly out-dated and generic looks utilized in the making of this model, its stand seems very fragile and causes the entire tv to lean forward. I had to fasten some paper underneath the front to simply keep it from toppling over. The one area Vizio did improve upon was the thinness of the tv itself. While not entirely up to competition's standards, it is improved. Design is poor and merits 2 stars.Conclusion...I wouldn't necessarily condemn this unit to the worst in the industry but its poor design and sub-par picture quality, when compared with competing brands and models, does not hold its own in the fight. I would only recommend this unit to those on a tight budget simply looking for an average HDTV that has internet and 3D capabilites. In an ideal situation, the XVT423SV or the larger 3D model in this series the  XVT3D474SV, both of which utilize a full array backlight, would provide much better picture quality overall and I would recommend those to be purchased instead.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great T.V.

I will tell you this, after getting the t.v. home and hooking it up to a blu-ray player in 1080. It is simply amazing, the picture is so clean and picturesque that you feel like you're right there. I recently went out and upgraded to a HD Cable box, before that with my standard cable I noticed static on the right speaker of the t.v. so I will see if that changes with the new box. Over all - Picture 5 out of 5, looks and fit 5 out of 5, Sound (movies 5 out of 5) standard t.v. sound (4 out of 5) 3-D (Haven't got the glasses yet, so far standard 3-D Glasses from the theater don't work) Over all in my opinion for the money and the quality that you get this is the best T.V. on the market. I've had it for 2 1/2 months with no other problems, other than some slight crackling on the right speaker on (I believe poor cable channels). Other than that it's worth every penny.

I really liked the set when it worked. It's important to note, though, that this unit doesn't currently have the capability to handle the signal from an up-conversion (2D to 3D via capable blu-ray player).

Most annoying, however, is that after a few days of use the remote control started to flake out. This Vizio comes with one of those chunky remotes that opens up to reveal a keyboard when you need it. When we first opened the box and I saw this remote, my first reaction was essentially \"how cool and clever,\" soon followed by \"there are a lot of things that can go wrong with this thing.\" I guess both reactions were correct, but the second one proved more to the point.After it's flaking-out period, the remote stopped working altogether. After spending a couple of hours with a customer service rep in online chat-room support, I was told I would be getting a new remote, to be shipped immediately and arrive within 8-9 business days.

These TVs replaced our much loved Sony WEGA 32\" and Panasonic 27\" analog tv's, which work perfectly.I decided on these particular Vizio models pretty much based on the PIP/POP feature, figuring that the mostly favorable reviews of the picture and other features would apply to me too.  My assessment of various TVs at Costco, Walmart and Fry's led me to believe that the Vizio seemed at least as good as the comparable competitors.  Good thinking, it's true, so far.There are many outstanding characteristics of these TVs that have been noted by other reviewers.  Picture is fabulous, sound is excellent (for a TV).  The PIP/POP feature works very well (you need a second source).  I have used Amazon Instant Video, YouTube, Pandora and some Google apps so far.  Google apps are underwhelming....  There are lots of other apps available.In my research for a TV with PIP, I viewed/downloaded User Guides for all the major TV manufacturers and I commend Vizio for having pretty much the best User Guide by far.The Remote for these TVs pairs nicely with your cable box or Tivo so that the remote can control device features when using the Input that the device is on.  Very nice feature.  However, like many devices, some features that I use are buried too far in the menu, so I usually use my jp1 Remotes to pull the features I need to the jp1 remote buttons, no menus needed.  This works well on the Vizios.Overall, I am very happy with both of these TVs.  My only lament in the switch from analog to digital technology is the time lag of changing channels/\"re-rendering\" the picture, slowness of PIP swapping and the terrible Closed Captioning performance by HDMI/Cable Boxes.  (I have the Cox SA8240 HDC cable box, which also has terrible PIP performance to go along with bad CC, also buried in the Cable Box menu, the Cox Remote CC button doesn't work at all--jp1 to the rescue, again).Thank you Amazon! ...and to UPS for hand delivery to my front door.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, a bit of overkill", "Author": "MITengineer", "ReviewID": "R114BJNR35SDAP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this TV.

After checking all connections on my end, I called Vizio customer service and was told it was their connection to Yahoo servers and was impacting everyone.  I wasn't aware that was how it worked, and had to wait about 48 hours for Yahoo to fix their issue, and then had to reset everything again after the Vizio rep stepped me through a full wipe and started over.  Temporarily frustrating, but apparently had never happened before.Anyone buying a 3D tv should know that there isn't much out there being broadcast in 3D.  ESPN has a channel and there's a special 3D channel that's a composite of nature and wildlife features.  No one else yet broadcasts in 3D.  Your basic option is BluRay discs in 3D.  It is a feature that will grow though over time.  Also, you probably won't notice, but there is no entity that broadcasts signals in 1080p.  The most you'll receive is 1080i.  You'll see this signal source in the upper right if you hit the INFO button on the remote.  When I say entity, I mean networks and tv stations.  As I stated though, you can't tell the difference.  720 to 1080, yes.  From i to p, not really.  These broadcast upgrades will come though too, from what I've skimmed from message boards, sometime in 2012.  With 3D, you do need the glasses.  Movie theater glasses do NOT work.  I tried.  The glasses for the tv have the special shuttering technology that receives the appropriate visual signals from the tv.  They are pricey, but that's the way it is.  I do suggest sticking with the Vizio glasses for product continuity.  Found a pair on Amazon for $96.  Check Ebay though for same product.  I found same there for $60 a pair.For the price and features, I am very pleased and do recommend this unit.  Get a soundbar though and those Vizio 3D glasses.

Since most said they hadn't tried the 3D part if it I wanted to do a quick review to help others who are actually shopping for a 3D set.  All I really need to say is that I am totally impressed with the quality of the 3D picture with the matching Vizio active shutter glasses (I got a set of 2 for $124).  I had originally planned to buy a Panasonic Viera set  - and I'm sure that is also a good choice - but when Amazon showed what others purchased after viewing my choice I decided to check out the Vizio.  What sold me was the 480hz resolution - which, as it turns out, makes for an amazing 3D experience.  It was also slightly cheaper than the Panasonic.I have no negative comments on this TV - it is exactly what I wanted and more.  I had a minor technical issue with my wireless router and the very friendly and knowledgeable tech support reps (in South Dakota - where I grew up!) had me up and running in no time.  I spent practically no time on hold.One other thing - I had debated for quite a while on the size of TV to get.  My viewing distance is a little over 9 feet.  I had originally wanted a 37\" but decided that might be too small so I shopped for a 40\".  Vizio didn't have a 40\" 3D TV so I decided - with some reservation - to go with the 42\".

Why would we buy a tv with less of a warranty after ours went dead 2 weeks after a year-long warranty ended? We called a repairman from a reputable local company who determined the main module on the tv is dead.

You can really see what it's capable of when playing a blu-ray disc - as good as, and in most cases better than, any movie I've watched in the theater. The 3D looks nice too. I wasn't sure whether I should go for an active system, like this one, or a passive one, but I've been happy with its performance so far. I've seen a Cirque du Soleil movie, Prometheus, Finding Nemo and the latest Spiderman movie, all in 3D, and they've all looked great. The apps have been easy to use, and I like the remote with its slide-out keyboard. The only complaint I have is that the speakers on this set don't do the stunning picture justice, so I'm going to get a soundbar for it. The speakers aren't bad, exactly - they're just average, and they just can't keep up with everything else this set has to offer. You will need to buy active 3D glasses as well.

Garcia \"Gmizz012\"", "ReviewID": "R1506ZUCOE8XFN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this set (42\", 480Hz, 3D) about a year and a half ago from Costco soon after it came out for $999.00, 3D glasses an extra $150/pair. For better of for worse, it is edge lit not full array.So there is some overbleed when viewing a black screen (blotchiness near the corners) but not too bad compared to others sets. My buddy has a 70\" Sharp Aquos, non-3D that's way worse in comparison.I love the set despite some slight glitches in the technology. Like other reviewers, my set occasionally shuts off and resets itself, and turns back on w the Vizio Logo flashing alternately white/orange, until it does so. Sometimes the remote [[which WILL DIE eventually...that's a whole other story -be prepared to buy a replacement]] will not control the set AT ALL. So I have to do a hard kill -unplug power source- and a restart, then everythings fine....until the next time it happens.Another innovative but faulty technology is the multifunction power/vol/selector \"button/knob\" on the side of the set. It seemed like a very sleek and intuitive solution to the multi-button panel on the side of most flat panel tv's that u need adequate lighting to see and decipher, before seemingly always pushing the wrong button, but alas when I try to turn the vol up, it of course goes down. So following that line of deduction, the opposite must be true, right.?? Not so fast. Turning the knob in attempt to lower the vol DOES make the vol go down, so it appears they need a lil more fine tuning on that one. The desired effect can be achieved w a super fine touch and some patience, but it's just quicker and less aggrivating to find the remote to adjust volume.As I mentioned, this particular remote, although handy w it's Bluetooth connectivity and full qwerty keyboard, is notorious for eventually dying out completely, w an exact replacement being about $60..!! But u can get a regular IR replacement that looks identical, minus the QWERTY Keyboard for about $8 on Amazon. Which is what I ended up doing. There's a newer version that has the QWERTY Keyboard on the back/underside of the remote which is getting good reviews for about $20, but I will wait awhile b4 trying that one since the current one works fine. I only use the full keyboard to search Netflix or Youtube, but not enough to justify getting a second remote just yet.And lastly, I love the Vizio Apps functionality and would love to utilize the Facebook app, but after having tried it I can't figure out how to sign out, so that someone else can sign in and use it.!! It seems that once you sign in, you have no choice but to remain signed in, not good esp if u have others sharing same TV. I learned the hard way, never leave any device signed in to your Fbook, or any acct, or u will have magically appearing posts, pics, and/or altered profiles, etc. :(It would go far to have a simple, prominently placed 'Sign out' button for the app. Utterly baffling to me that this was overlooked.If this set didn't have the glitches in functionality, it would be a 5 star reveiew for sure. At that point all I could complain about is the high gloss finish, since it reflects any light source brightly, and can be distracting.  But that's the direction all tv's are going nowadays it seems, high gloss rather than a logical matte finish.  Overall this is a great set, eventhough I paid a lil' more for it having bought it soon after it came out.  It looks great up on the wall, and I can swivel it almost 180* w the long-reach 36\" swivel arm mount, so the tv becomes viewable from the kitchen as well as the den. :]", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Review", "Author": "Alex Perez", "ReviewID": "R3M0O7156NJFSX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Product was as described and  advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied  with my purchase , Price was good", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Vizio Customer Service", "Author": "DT", "ReviewID": "R208PYAG8J0P99", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this from Amazon Warehouse deals, and it arrived right on time.

About five minutes in, the TV went black.  Hasn't shown an image, since.  I'm a broken man.  Now, I have to spend my one day off from work shipping this TV back to the seller.Only after purchasing the TV and looking for solutions did I find that dozens and dozens of people have been having the same problem that I have.  My last TV was a Vizio and I love it.  I was a fan of the brand.  This experience has me really questioning my loyalty.  We'll see how things go when I try to contact the seller later on, today.

I have this set in my bedroom and when the shades are drawn closed the lighting is real dark and still this sensor would not illuminate the colors, opening the shades for full light made it impossible to see as well. Now I can adjust the edge lit back light and my colors pop off the screen.The 3D works great, no cross talk or ghosting. If you haven't watched Avatar in 3D you are missing out. This set makes that movie an incredible experience. Although the set does not come with 3D glasses, Amazon has some incredible deals for a set of two Vizio Shutter glasses. Just do a search and you'll see several sellers.My overall experience with Vizio and this set have been excellent.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blown Away!", "Author": "Mapman \"AOT\"", "ReviewID": "R3PQWCA8I8L5J2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since other reviews go through many details, I'll simply say this is the best electronic purchase I've ever made!

USB ports do nothing, vizio says they will work with a firmware update that I waited over 2 months for. Bluetooth audio output is a great idea but has no volume adjustment which made it useless in my setup. Auto brightness has no minimum setting and is way too dark in a darker room. 3D is active type requiring expensive glasses which this tv does not come with. When I complained to vizio tech support about the picture quality they eventually recommended another vizio, non-3d model and said it had a better picture despite lower specs. I am now watching my new LG 3D, which uses and comes with passive glasses and has a much better picture.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "It does one thing very well...", "Author": "Relic37", "ReviewID": "RHNT49SIMGOUE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What is does well is suck. After an incredibly rigorous time-period of about 4-days, where it was turned on for up to an hour a day (yes, I realize we were punishing in our use), the TV now refuses to stay on for longer than 5-seconds at a time. It seemed like a good price for all the features included, and now I know why. The TV sucks. Now the hassle of returning a large TV...what a joy! Whatever it is replaced with, it will not be a Vizio.

This was in January 2011.  The truth is if you buy this TV today (July 2011), Hulu and Blockbuster will NOT be on it, nor will they show up when the TV updates itself when you first hook it up to the net.  Will they ever appear?  Who knows?  Vizio is apparently content to announce things as fact, when they know full well it will take them months (at least) to roll out to all their customers, including new ones.I suppose the picture is good enough for the price.  But I was expecting (& needing) Hulu Plus.  This falsehood has really soured me on the brand.  I'm planning on buying a 55-inch later this year.  I guarantee you it won't be a Vizio.  If certain apps are important to you, I suggest emailing their customer service and get it guaranteed in writing, *before* you give them your money.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0045TZF66"}}
