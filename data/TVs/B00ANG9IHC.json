It was a gift for my sister.  Took it to her apartment, unpacked, programmed it, and it looks great.  The picture and color are great.  Only took a few minutes to get it working.  My sister has only had it a week but has had no problems so far.  The stand is a little flimsy.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Video - Poor Audio", "Author": "David Dreisbach \"David D.\"", "ReviewID": "R11MXN2S8W6NC2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV at Best Buy for $160.  It was a great deal on the perfect TV for my purposes, I thought.  Picture and color are great.  No problems with setup.  Remote works good.  However, the speakers are in the rear of the TV and are weak.  Any slight amount of background noise drowns out the TV.  I was going to add an inexpensive sound system to it but there's no audio output!  Who makes a TV without so much as a headphone jack?!  I contacted LG customer service to see if there was anything else I could do but they never responded to my inquiry.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this tv", "Author": "Brenda Huntley", "ReviewID": "R3VPEXC3YCP7O5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have a smaller tv and upgrade to something like this, you'll be amazed at the difference.  The only thing I need to say is out of the box, the black is not too sharp on the screen.  You have to go through the color setup, (which I've never seen on a tv) to set it up to your preferences, then it looks awesome.  I know it's only 720 p but even our kids colorful bluray movies look amazing.Very happy with it.  You can't beat it for the price.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works we'll", "Author": "Lyndon F.
