The HD and digital cable picture is flawless and the sound is great even w/o surround speakers.Plenty of features including the PC hookup which is friggen great.  I didn't think I'd use that at all but I went ahead and hooked up a wireless mouse and keybord to my PC which means I can do everything I want on my machine but now I have a 56\" screen", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great HD Television", "Author": "Q.Q. McMudd", "ReviewID": "R21HK7KP7MRYHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this Zenith HD TV from ShopNBC a year ago and have had no problems.  It's one of the earlier HD DLP's and has only one HDMI slot and is a 1080i.  Honestly, I can see very little difference between this and the 1080p models.  BD looks great on it.  I hooked it up with the Onkyo 805 with a Samsung BD1400 and everything works and sounds terrific.  I have a Bose surround sound system and I never heard them sound so clear.  Zenith probably doesn't make this model anymore but if you are on a low budget and looking for a good HD TV, this one will work very well for you.  I have read many poor reviews about the Sammy BD1400.  I don't care about PIP or BD Live...nor do I know of anyone who cares much for those features.  The bottom line is that I am very please with my low end entertainment system.  The Onkyo 805 is one powerful, dependable, and well thought out AV Receiver with all the features one could possibly need for a home entertainment system.  The THX sounds unbelievable.  With it three (HDMI) inputs, I have all I will ever need for my needs.  When the PS3 160 becomes available, I will at last have a completes system.  I am confined to a wheelchair and can't get around as I once did.  This system with the Zenith is everything I will need and I am very happy with it.  Thanks and have a great day!", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Randy Cortez", "ReviewID": "R1WHLLSERQG4C2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is great. It has lots of features including a QAM tuner built right in for receiving digital cable without the need for a setop box. The 1080i is just beautiful on this TV. I paid only $1099 shipping included which is a lot less than some of the other HDTV's out there and it is just as good if not better. I definitely recommend this TV to everyone that wants one.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "zenith mark 2", "Author": "C.

Our old brand was a Zenith so we decided to go with them again since we had such good luck with the old one. I was afraid we would be disappointed but we absolutely love this tv. Not only does it have all the improvements that we were missing, but for the price the picture is fantastic and since we are setting it on a raised hearth the depth of less that 18\" is just fine. After looking at the more expensive really flat panels and deciding to hold off a while, we happened across this tv and have no regrets.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "DLP Integrated HDTV\n2500:1 High Contrast Ratio\nHigh Definition TV\nAdvanced Connectivity\n1280 x 720p Resolution", "Name": "Zenith Z56DC1D 56-Inch DLP HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31w%2BopIAb7L.jpg", "ProductID": "B000K7M6D2"}}
