{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture great price", "Author": "Eric Meyers", "ReviewID": "R28PX309I5BHY4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Easy setup, great price, great vibrant colors and blacks, works well with sound bar that comes with the TV, The TV took about 5 min to setup from out of the box to actually watching the TV.  Picture looks amazing even over my previous 1080p LCD Toshiba TV.  Sound bar is very easy to setup and comes with the optical cable already in the box.Cons: Not Wifi ready out of the box (need an adapter) and placement of the HDMI Ports.  This could be me just nitpicking but for a Smart  TV not to be wifi ready is a little annoying and the HDMI spots cause the cords to stick out from the side of the TV unless wire managed.Overall this is a great TV for the price even after looking around for other TVs in the same price range.  I am extremely happy with my purchase", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "After a month of use, I couldn't be happier with the purchase", "Author": "Zamazon", "ReviewID": "R2WS61IJMQDC19", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this up for the (somewhat large) studio apartment I am sharing with my fiancee.  After having it for about a month, I really couldn't be happier.The picture:As some others mentioned, certain settings can give video a \"soap opera\" quality, where humans seem a bit too real and sets appear to be, well, sets.  This reminded me of when I first saw the Hobbit in theaters.  It's not necessarily a bad effect at all times--it just speaks to the size of the screen and the incredible refresh and vividness of the display.  In any case, however, you can easily diminish that effect by adjusting the color scheme and trumotion settings.  Both are painless to fiddle and the TV remembers your settings on a HDMI input basis, so you can have one custom setting for your bluray, one for your roku, one for your game system, etc.  This has worked very well for me and I'm still amazed by the quality I get from all inputs.The sound:I use the bar and it works very well for me.  1/4th volume more than fills my studio apt.  The sound is also very clear and has good dynamic range to my ears.  Using it to play pandora in the background works very nicely, for example, and I've never had issues with distortion or any such thing during loud scenes in movies.  I did have one random incident where the TV had trouble syncing with the sound bar (after the sound bar had automatically powered down while I fiddled with the TV settings and features), but that was remedied by shutting both the TV and sound bar off and on again.  I never had another incident like that again.  I'm not sure if that's because I rarely have my TV on for extended periods without sound (thus allowing the sound bar to power down) or because a recent software update to the TV fixed the sync problems.  Whatever the reason, I find the sound bar to be a great addition.The features:Since I have a roku, I honestly don't use the smart TV features much.  When I do, however, they seem to work fine.  Using my ipad as a remote (easy to set up with a free app), it's quite easy to browse the internet or use services like Netflix and Hulu.  I purchased the roku at the same time as the TV and slightly prefer its navigation and universal search, but I think anyone could get by just using the smart TV features here.  They are quite nice and LG seems to update the system relatively frequently.All in all, I highly recommend this combo pack.  I don't review much on here, but this has really surpassed my expectations.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "darrin j. ficke", "ReviewID": "R1Z85N9PT0OOQV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "TV has great picture and easy to use Smart Apps.

Just about everything is amazing on this LG TV the Picture,colors and white & black looks fantastic! No sound sync problems either and i was shocked at the LG apps they're awesome some are pre-installed too...Free movies(Crackle),free games(CC required) & a web browser that looks fantastic & works great too! It can do a whole lot more!!!!Con's:The Glare can be pretty bad in the right spots & with white walls with a light source near them you can see it on the TV pretty bad, but i recommend the room to have a low light setting. A bright room without a light source near the TV. (Picture looks awesome with HDMI cable box & Xbox 360 without glare) Also wish it had S-video hook-up or coax for DVD player. I had my Xbox 360 hooked up to the Component part with the green,red and blue cord that came with my Xbox 360 and it gave me a pretty bad ghosting image effect on the TV but when hooked up with HDMI its crystal clear amazing HD image no ghosting at all ( still not sure if its my cord or the LG TV's in general as it did do the same ghosting thing on another LG when the 360 was hooked up with ComponentIll update this as needed also Amazons tech support and CS are awesome love shopping online at amazon!** Fixed some info above. Update 1 month+: **The sound bar is NOT better than the Tv speakers when Smartsound is turned on with volume options set on high(wide) its better than the sound bar IMO. I was wrong about free movies unless you use crackle or an app like it. Unfortunately i'm still unable to test a newXbox 360 Component HD AV Cable as my old one gave me horrible ghost image on two different LG TV's if and when i do get a new cable i'll update again. My 5.1 wont work right when hooked up with digital audio from the TV to the receiver, but it worked when it was hooked up through the Xbox 360 component HD AV Cable via digital audio cable to the receiver just my luck also my 5.1 isn't HDMI sadly its kinda old too, but its always had some problems so it could just be my 5.1 not sure. All in all the picture still looks amazing on Xbox & HD Cable. I'm still loving it i'm still happy i bought it!

I went through all the usual trouble shooting, but the problem continued. This problem was intermittent but very annoying. I returned the TV and sound bar. The sound quality of the bar is mediocre at best. Another issue with sound is that you can't use the graphic equalizer in the TV with any external speakers, not even with a matched LG sound bar.

No issues here.* The apps work well, and it has Netflix and other 3rd-party content providers. Great!The Bad:* The soundbar was difficult to manage. It has its own on/off control, and does not sync with the TV power (sometimes it worked, sometimes not). Most of the time I had to get up and walk across the room to power on the soundbar to hear the TV. This is not a quality experience.* Trumotion is LG's version of the technology to insert additional video frames between source frames to make the picture seem smoother. Some like it, some hate it (I'm the latter). There is a setting to disable it, but it re-enables itself whenever I watch Netflix. I find Trumotion distracting, and I have to re-disable it every time. Again, not a quality experience.The Ugly:* LG serves you ads (yes, ads on the TV you just purchased at full price). This is not a discounted or subsidized TV. This is a full retail, full price version. There was no indication from Amazon that ads would be displayed, so I did not expect to see ads. Shame on LG.* LG collects your personal viewing habits (shows you watch, channels, services, etc) and filenames stored on any external storage you attach to the TV or on a shared network drive, and sends them to LG's servers without your permission. No, I am not kidding. There is a setting in the preferences called \"Collection of watching info\". You can set this to off, but the TV still collects your data and uploads to their servers. Shame on LG! In a very public mea culpa, LG promised to \"fix the bug\" in a future firmware update.See these articles:[...][...]Just google \"lg collecting data\" for the entire disgusting story.To not be spied on by LG, your options here include:- Not buying this or any LG TV- Not connecting your LG TV to the internet (difficult if your whole point is to stream Netflix and the like)- Tolerating LG's wanton disregard for your privacy, and allowing them to collect whatever data they want and use as they see fit/sell to whomever, for profit, without compensating you- Waiting for the firmware update that addresses the issue and keep your LG TV off of your home network and the internet until you've applied the update.You've been warned.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Got a great deal!

I haven't had time to optimize the display yet, but l will (will probably do with the utility that's included in the Finding Nemo CD).Really like the Smart TV features, and after owning for about 3 weeks now have only scratched the surface of what it can do.  It has an Ethernet port.  It detects our PC on the same network (when it's on) and it looks like I'll be able to view pictures and video/ movies, and music loaded on my PC, which I'm definitely going to look into further.Size.  I was targeting a 42\" TV for this room but ended up buying this 47\" model, and happy I did.  It doesn't overwhelm the room, and the image is stunning.  Very small frame around the picture.What I didn't like:Getting a sound bar, since I already got a 5.1 surround system.  But at the time I couldn't find another TV I wanted, for the price at this size and feature set.  I made the best of it by selling the unopened sound bar on Craigslist.Had to buy an digital audio optical cable to get the ARC (audio return channel) feature to work with my Receiver and HDMI cable.  I now see that cable may have been in the sound bar box.No built in WiFi.  I initially didn't mind this, since I planned on using an Ethernet cable, but to take advantage of the WiDi, wireless linking to mobile devices, I have to go wireless with the TV as well.

The Wifi options are also extremely limited because you need to pick up an adapter to actually get it to work. Amazon makes that very clear but I almost didn't want to believe it.I actually take offense to the idea that this sound bar is considered \"Free\". Was the guy who brought the sound bar to my door paid for picking it up? So what if it was in the box; somebody still has to get paid to lug this tinny mother around.Luckily it takes no time to set this television up and it is really easy to move around. And the Wifi works great, of course, once you get that adapter going. Never has youtube pixellation/buffering looked so clear to me! Oh, and if you're planning on plugging your PS3 up to this it has HDMI input so as long as you have an HDMI cable you'll be good to go.Over all this is a nice product but I wish I had thought twice about the \"free\" sound bar. 60 watts isn't very impressive at all and I wish I had maybe bought a cheaper tv and then maybe a replacement sound system for the living room to go with it.One last note: TruMotion so I don't know about the rest of you all but sports are nonparalleled on a tv like this. It makes it hard to watch channels that don't support TruMotion because it looks SO.
