{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice 4k $699 screen", "Author": "sd card user", "ReviewID": "RZPOOX2GZBZCD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "mostly using as  hdmi computer monitor :  has smaller pixels and good viewing angle.  The supplied mount in bundle only allows for slight tilt adjustment.  You'll need to find a different mount if you want to rotate the screen for either landscape or portrait orientation.Works ok when connected to antenna for ATSC reception.  Can use the CH List button to navigate the detected channels.  There is no program guide except for INFO on the current program.As other reviews have noted,  the internal upscaling may be lacking  and 1080i inputs might look better through an external device that has better 4k conversion.Overall works well as a computer monitor.  Haven't noticed any bad pixels.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great as a computer monitor", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R1TSB0FG1PQXNL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a computer monitor and it sadly did not work when I used the HDMI connection to my desktop (works with my Dell laptop).
