I spent around $149.00 for each of them.I really couldn't be happier with them, both have very clear bright pictures. I have both setup as double monitors on my PC, one with VGA and one with HDMI. The secondary also doubles as my tv with an HDMI connection to my cable box.Both have been virtually running non stop, since I got them with no appreciable signs wear or  usage.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Sansui 24\" LED-LCD 1080p 60Hz HDTV | SLED2453W", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OlO8HvKGL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008OK6VWO"}}
