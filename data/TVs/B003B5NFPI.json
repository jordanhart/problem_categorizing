{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Jaw dropper..", "Author": "Floyd Goodrich \"Jim G.\"", "ReviewID": "R22HF4OS7VJ37Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I happened upon a shopping network that spent an hour promoting this TV. I got interested and did as much researching as I could then finally ordered it through Amazon. Right out of the box without any adjustments I could hardly believe my eyes, the picture was just great and the sound is also very good. The contrast on this TV is claimed at five million to one due to the extra yellow pixel. Don't know about 5 million but I will say the contrasts this TV produces are the best I've ever seen and by a long-shot. I will say this TV has the best and most real looking color of any TV I've ever seen, it's really something to see. A few nit-picks are that the volume button is to close to the channel up-down button on the remote, you have to be careful in the dark adjusting the volume or you go to an over the air channel by mistake then you have to redo your input selection. The screen has a glass cover and it reflects room items badly so you need to keep the room dark in front of the TV to keep glare off of it. The really nice features are 4 HDMI connections and a component connection plus 2 USB (thumb-drive) connections where you can view JPEG pictures or listen to MP3 music. It also has an assortment for other attachments so it lacks nothing. The base for this TV is made of glass and metal, nice looking and substantial. It's not 3D ready but my wife can't watch 3D anyway so that's not an issue to me. The TV is extremely thin and if you wanted to wall mount it, it would be easy as the connections on this TV connect to the side or to the bottom, none on the back. All I can say is this is the absolute best picture I've ever seen in my 71 years on a TV and it has very nice sound. What more could I ask for.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Happy Sharp LC52LE820UN customer", "Author": "rt", "ReviewID": "R2NGO54R6AA1Q3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Several weeks back, we ordered this TV from Modia through Amazon.com.  The TV arrived in poor shape, large holes in the box exposing the TV itself.  We refused delivery and Amazon.com was very prompt in refunding our money.  Modia was most uncooperative in resolving this situation.  Needless to say, we will not be doing business with Modia evermore.After the disappointing delivery, the order from Vanns arrived in pristine shape, including the box in which it was packed.  And at a price of nearly $150 less.The TV was easy to connect including a 10/12-year old receiver that allows us to watch our laser disc collection.  Picture and sound are great.  I would recommend Amazon.com, Vanns and Sharp to anyone looking for a great TV at a great price with excellent customer service.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful and easy enough for an HD beginner", "Author": "216bhv", "ReviewID": "R1W4CSQ6OV49VZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After deciding to go HD, we waded through the confusing jungle of equipment and options.  We chose this TV for its picture quality and style, which do not disappoint.  It was unexpectedly easy to unpack and set up, only requiring a screwdriver to attach the base securely.  Since it is very heavy (not surprising for the size of it), having home delivery was a great option. It was awesome for watching football and we can't wait to explore more programming.  Now if someone would just do something about the ridiculous cable HD charges.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT Picture - Just don't necessarily trust item condition given by Warehouse deals", "Author": "B.K.", "ReviewID": "RZYY5IRSSHUJ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I called Sharp and without any trouble, registered for the warranty.  (When you call and register, they add an extra 3 months to the warranty period free of charge)The picture is absolutely fantastic.  I upgraded from a 37\" Aquos LCD that was about fours years old and I must say I am impressed.  The colors are great once the TV is calibrated.  The Aquos net is not really my thing as it is kind-of slow and I dont see anything useful that I can't get faster by picking up my phone, but it streams Netflix, and I thought it streamed Pandora, but I got it mixed up with the next higher-up model, so it doesn't (my mistake).  My first LCD was the Sharp Aquos mentioned above and we still have it and it works wonderfully.  I went with Sharp because they didn't disappoint the first time, and they definitely didn't this time either.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture!", "Author": "Jazz Guy", "ReviewID": "R1P74RF7180VPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently traded up to this model from the LC-32LE700UN, which, wonderful as that one is, I found that with the unbelievable definition I could get away with a larger screen, even in my small room.  I am so glad I did too, now.  Also the Quattron feature, which far too many reviewers have rated as bogus in my opinion, either they cannot see color, or my imagination ran off with me, because the yellows on this one jump right out AT you.  The blues are brighter too, which seemed impossible over the earlier Sharp TV.  I've seen a lot of reviews who suggested watching \"The Earth\" on Blu-ray, so I tried that this time, and therein lies the proof!  If TV stores really want comparisons they should offer this to their customers on the sales floor.  What you'll find I believe, is that no other TV can make the ocean blue come to life like the Sharp Quattron does.As for the Netflix feature, for some reason I have yet to get that to work, which also was a problem on the 32-inch, though on that one I solved it by using a BD player that did the conversion. I had hoped this TV (which claimed a straight-in ethernet line was all it required, with a Netflix account) would deliver, but it puts up a window about the DNS, which I have no idea about..the router is working for everything else, so I guess I need to talk to Customer Service about it.The sound is really quite good, perhaps the larger size (it's huge!) allows for better speakers, but I went into \"bullet-bite\" mode and purchased a very nice Yamaha HTIB, and wow what a difference.  Still, for those not totally into the audio portion, it will do just fine.This TV was extremely heavy--even the delivery men said so--you will need assistance if you're hanging it up.  Mine fortunately fits perfectly in its stand on my table.As for the refresh rate..I was skeptical about the idea that you \"had to have\" 240Hz, but since this has never been a problem before, I dove in with this one which is 120Hz.  That being said, I DID have some smearing (skipping, stutter, whatever the term is) but it only appears on one CD and one Netflix I've played so far, and not at all with the High-def channels, so...keeping fingers crossed.To sum up, I'd say if you like perfect picture, like a larger screen, and don't want to pay $2000 or even more for it, buy this one. It has the gorgeous backlighting of LED, and I got this one on Amazon on sale, through J&R; for $1149.  For a 52\" I'd say that's just about as low as you'll see, at this time anyway.  I did notice it has gone up already (I checked, even though they say you shouldn't ;) but I wouldn't worry too much, sales are going on all the time.  Best of luck in your search for Perfect HDTV--I found mine.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "my 1st big screen tv", "Author": "iowabob", "ReviewID": "R3MLN09E4BIIZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my wife and i are very pleased to finally enter the high-def tv phase of the home entertainment part of our lives.we shopped around and the picture of the sharp just grabbed us and we are happy we chose this model.it was very easy to set up and the factory settings are more than adequate.the sound is okay but would be enhanced by getting a home theatre system.overall we are very satisfied with this purchase and the tv got to us sooner than the stand.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Performance", "Author": "RC \"RC\"", "ReviewID": "R23U2UUNZBVTYI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV rocks.

The colors are vivid and the hd picture looks great. Video games and blu rays look awesome too.Now onto the downside. The sound is horrible. It sounds hollow and the bass is non existent. Another huge problem with the built in speakers is there is a lip sync issue. The audio is slightly behind the video. The good thing is an external sound system fixes the lip sync problem.Overall, a good tv, and a great tv if hooked up with a sound system.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "SHarp 52: LE820UN", "Author": "nab", "ReviewID": "R267EH8ULBF98Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellant TV, everything works as in manual, super clear picture on 1080; no issues, Sharp excellant service when called for a question, no problems.

None of these negatives apply to Amazon. However, we were told it was good in bright rooms (we have a big picture window) but it is VERY reflective, not a matte screen as we were told.  The menu is difficult as I see in other reviews.  The \"on\" light is white on a silver background; you can barely see it in daylight so you can't tell it's warming up or off.Now for the biggie that takes this TV from a 5 to a 2.  There are no three wire RCA input terminals, only the main five wire, which means no color image on 3 wire.  If you are looking for an easy setup for DVD and games, this is NOT your TV.  My WII and XBox360 won't connect without special attachments which I haven't found yet.  And I'm an electronics person.  The only input besides the 5 wire RCA and the cable are HDMI, USA, AV, and Analog, not standard connections for auxiliary equipment.
