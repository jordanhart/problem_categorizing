{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Remarkable picture, beautiful design!", "Author": "Amy S.", "ReviewID": "R2PLOH0W2I4PI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "~~My Setup~~The Panasonic VIERA TC-L47WT50 47-Inch is remarkably thin and the industrial design is gorgeous. I did not wall mount the unit, but put it on my media console. For console use, there's a bit of assembly involved with attaching the unit to the stand and you will need two people to do it safely.I have it hooked up to a Panasonic blu-ray player, TiVo TCD748000 Premiere XL DVR (Black), Apple TV MC572LL/A (2010) [OLD VERSION], and Xbox 360 4GB Console via an Onkyo HT-RC180 7.2-Channel A/V Surround Home Network Receiver (Black). Because my AV receiver does not support HDMI 1.4 (only 1.3), I cannot pass 3D or audio return channel (ARC) through the receiver. I solved this by connecting my hardware directly to the Panasonic with HDMI cables and using the TV for video switching.For audio, I am runinng an AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable, 6 Feet from the TV to the Onkyo. I hooked the TV up to the Internet with an AmazonBasics RJ45 Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable (14 Feet/4.2 Meters).I have a Kinect Sensor with Kinect Adventures! unit for my XBox 360. I used to attach it to the top of my TV, but due to the Panasonic's thin width and lack of an real bezel, I set the Kinect in front of the TV. It works well there and maintains about a 1-inch clearance between the top of the Kinect and the Panasonic logo at the bottom of the TV.After the hardware was attached, turning on the unit prompted an initial walk-through that was simple enough for a technology luddite. As a professional user experience designer, I appreciate the time and development that goes into making the user's first experience pain free. And it was.~~2D~~I tested the 2D picture for a week using all of my video sources and watching a variety of shows, movies, and sporting events. It's exceptional--crisp, clear, and beautiful. The high refresh rate prevents the ghosting you see on less expensive units and the viewing angle is certainly the widest I've seen. I even rearranged my TV room to allow for more seating at wider angles.~~3D~~I didn't think it was fair to review a 3D TV without fully testing this feature, so even though I'm not a fan of 3D generally, I purchased a pair of Panasonic VIERA TY-ER3D4MU Active Shutter 3D Eyewear. (You can charge these using the 3 USB ports on the side of the TV. Each pair takes about 30 mins to fully charge.) The glasses fit on top of my regular glasses and are light-weight and easy to wear.I have two 3D channels with my Comcast package--ESPN3D and Xfinity3D. (The channels remind me of the HD channels we had a decade ago--mostly nature shows and sports, not much else.) To test, I watched a college football game, a college basketball game, a nature show, and a concert. One of the sports games was recorded on TiVo and one was live. Both ESPN3D games stuttered a bit, making for frustrating viewing, but I definitely got a sense for 3D sports and as the 3D capture technology improves I suspect these glitches will fade.To access 3D, the Panasonic will first detect the signal. Then it will ask you to press the 3D button on your remote and follow the instructions for setup. You are supposed to turn the glasses on after the signal comes in (there are quite a few ways the signal can be interpretted and the tv must sync to the glasses and tell them how to \"read\" the picture).For the most part, the 3D picture is impressive. I found that the sports images are less crisp than produced videos (which makes sense). The viewing angle is less wide with 3D on (I'd say about 90 degrees for a clear view).Signal loss can be a problem. If at any point the TV \"thinks\" it is in 2D, the glasses lose their pairing and you have to resync by sliding a button at the top. Ergo, commercials have to be in 3D to prevent this from happening--so there weren't any commercials (hurray!).The glasses are annoying if you want to look at your phone, flip through a magazine, and so on. However, wearing them generally and looking around the room is not a problem.I was pleased that my TV Premiere XL performed so well with 3D.~~Smart Apps~~The VIERA Smart apps are accessed from the Internet button on both remotes. You can add and delete apps and customize which screen they appear on. When viewing apps, whatever is currently playing on the TV will still be playing in a small window in the middle (love this!).Social Networking TV--These feature is exceptional! You can add your Facebook and Twitter accounts and and watch tv while your feeds stream. The television picture is wrapped in a network-specific skin. I am able to watch tv playing from my TiVo while still using the TiVo remote. I can use either Panasonic remote to scroll through feed content. You can even \"Like\" or \"Comment\" on streams. With Twitter, you watch the feed of a specific hashtag or handle--great for sports or awards shows. One of my new favorite ways to use this feature is to listen to Pandora (via TiVo) and have my Facebook and Twitter feeds up. This is useful while you're doing other things around the house.Pandora--The Pandora app for VIERA is excellent. I have Pandora on pretty much all of my devices and this is one of the better implementations.~~Negatives~~My only general critique is that the glass screen on the Panasonic is incredibly reflective in the bright room where my TV lives. It reminds me a lot of the screens on Apple iMac. It will take a bit of getting used to and some room darkening shades.Some people are frustrated that, at this price point, the unit doesn't come with 3D glasses. I think it's a smart choice for Panasonic to leave them out to keep the price a bit lower for consumers who aren't ready to adopt this fledgling technology that doesn't have a lot of content available. You can always add glasses later and they'll probably come down in price over time.~~Summary~~Overall this is an excellent TV. The 2D picture is remarkable and the design is beautiful and unobtrusive in even the most minimalist environments. The Internet features are some of the best I've seen.I don't expect to use the 3D much until the Olympics. Panasonic is the exclusive TV partner with the 2012 Olympics and this is one of their signature TVs. I expect they will want the 3D capability to shine.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Flagship Performance and Features", "Author": "J. Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"", "ReviewID": "R379Z3WCB85XLZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Viera TC-L47WT50 is Panasonic's 2012 flagship 3D LED-LCD HDTV.  It offers a host of luxury features that likely covers every consumer's wish list.  Performance is excellent overall, with only a few minor issues.==Menu==The menu is the similar to previous Viera menus (and close to Samsung's layout).  Most settings are easy to access and the picture settings most users should leave alone are sensibly located under \"Pro Settings.\"  All menus are responsive, attractive and easy to read.  Most common functions can be accessed with just one or two buttons.  The setup wizard takes very little time to go through but also provides substantial guidance.  For my personal wi-fi setup, I had to use the green button on the remote to switch to capital letters and also select \"open\" for \"security type\"; I use WEP.==Picture==The picture on most LCD's is rather good these days, but few models can compete with the Viera WT50. Thanks to LED local dimming, an IPS panel, and IFScc calibration settings, the WT50's picture is breathtaking.  Out of the box, colors are fairly accurate, rich and vibrant.  The Cinema mode preset works well for dimly lit and dark rooms.  Once calibrated, this TV really pops.  As with most LCD's, the brightness is more than abundant, making it a good TV for any room.  Contrast, gamma, gray-scale, line resolution, viewing angle, and screen uniformity are all excellent.  The black levels are good, but don't reach the inky blacks found on high-end Viera plasmas.  Switching on the adjustments to improve black levels works, but creates worse problems.  Screen is glossy, which I prefer, and does not suffer badly from reflections.It took me a while to find any issues/artifacts with the picture.  Eventually I discovered that certain content with slight gradations of blue seem to form large blocks (like macro-blocking from compressed action scenes).  This only happened with content from my cable box (1080i), but did happen with different channels.  I viewed the same content on my Samsung B8500 and the artifacts were not present.  I tried every combination of video correction settings on the WT50 and did not find a solution.  To put into perspective, this only affected the picture for about 30 seconds out of dozens of hours of viewing.==Aesthetics==The bezel of the TV is roughly \u00bc\" all around, which is impressive and attractive.  The depth of the TV is just 1.1\", also impressive.  While the bezel itself is minimalist, there is a clear plastic strip on the bottom of the panel with \"Panasonic\" written in the middle, which by default lights up.  The strip is clear and unobtrusive.  The subtle white light can be disabled.  The stand is not for me, with its two striking, silver projections;  it would have been nice in brushed metal instead of plastic.  This TV would look amazing mounted on a wall.==Build==The TC-L47WT50 is fairly light at 28.7 lbs. or 35.3 lbs. with stand, making it easy to setup by oneself.  The stand seems sturdy enough, but is mostly plastic. The stand doesn't offer any tilt and only swivels +/- 15\u00b0.  Inputs are streamlined: there is one component/composite input, which requires the included adapter cable.  There is a VGA port and 4 HDMI, but no DVI.  An SD card slot and three (yes 3!) USB 2.0 ports round out the inputs. The flimsy buttons on the TV are inconveniently placed and will be inaccessible if wall mounted.  The back of the TV is impressively all metal, attractive and very sturdy.  The touchpad remote seems like a gimmick that I can't imagine most people using more than once or twice.  The main remote is responsive and has a good layout.  It is similar to most Viera remotes.==Motion Handling==One option I always look for right away is smoothing out motion (sometimes separated into blur and judder). Most LCD's have issues producing clear, smooth, flowing video of motion. This is a major disadvantage vs. plasma, which does not suffer the same problem. The refresh rates (240Hz) are used to adjust the way your eyes see the motion on the television by refreshing/adjusting the image on screen.  I believe the \"1920 backlight scanning\" means that the backlight flickers 32 times per second, which is supposed to help motion perception. In the best TV sets, the video is processed so that there is no stuttering and also no \"Soap Opera Effect,\" a problem introduced when there is too much processing that can make any video look unnaturally smooth as the processing tries to correct the normal variations in speed that us living things tend to do so much when we move about. Unfortunately, with the WT50, you have only basic control over the motion handling.  I found that using \"moderate\" or \"strong\" motion handling produced a \"Soap Opera Effect.\"  However, the \"weak\" setting seemed effective enough at reducing motion blur for all but the most active content.  For sports, you may want to use \"moderate.\"==Calibration==If you plan to calibrate this TV yourself, you'll be happy to find the ISFccc settings for RGB gain (2-point IRE gray-scale) and hue/saturation/luminance (as opposed to RGB sliders used by Samsung) for primaries and secondary colors. These features will mainly interest videophiles with a color spectrometer.  Considering the price tag and potential of the WT50, I would recommend spending the time or money on a proper calibration.  I was disappointed to find that I could not hit the targets on the CIE diagram for blue and green primaries.  This could be an issue with my specific panel or with the WT50 in general.  Gray-scale and gamma came in line fairly easily.  Pictures of my results are at the top of the product page.  Note that 3D mode and Viera Connect picture settings have their own individual profiles that save separately - a terrific feature.==Sound==I usually don't bother even reviewing the audio for an HDTV.  As TV's get thinner and thinner, so do their speakers.  Regardless of how advanced speakers are technologically, small speakers can only do so much.  Still, I was completely surprised with the fidelity and output from the WT50's speakers.  Even the soundstage projected a basic presence.  While I would still recommend external speakers, the internal ones will not disappoint.==The Third Dimension==At first I dismissed 3D HDTV as a novelty when it came out due to the lack of content.  However, now that content is becoming much more widely available, I do appreciate having a 3D capable HDTV.  My wife was particularly impressed by the 2D -> 3D upconverted content and actual 3D content is truly spellbinding.  The Panasonic VIERA TY-ER3D4MU Active Shutter 3D Eyewear aren't cheap but I would not hesitate to purchase a pair.  Unfortunately, none are included with the WT50.  My wife did notice a slight flickering in the left eye of the glasses, but I did not.  We both wear eyeglasses and were able to fit the 3D glasses over them.  The 3D glasses are more comfortable and light than others I have tried in the past.  The TV dims significantly when in 3D mode, but all the picture settings are saved separately for 3D mode (and for Apps), so it's easy to compensate for the differences.==Other Features==The feature list of the WT50 is amazing.  The internal wi-fi gets great reception and speed on the second floor, with my router on the first floor; it can take 10-30 seconds to connect when powering on.  Bluetooth is also included so you can connect a keyboard, audio device, etc.  The USB ports give you even more connectivity options (though my third-party webcams won't work).  You can also use your smartphone as a remote and interact with your TV through Panasonic smartphone apps.  I did not notice any issues with input lag when in Game Mode.The \"Viera Tools\" button, located prominently on the remote, brings up the applications.  The WT50 comes with many apps pre-installed (Amazon, Skype, Netflix, Pandora, YouTube, Hulu).  I immediately setup the Amazon Instant Video service, which had become the main use of my Playstation 3.  All the apps work great and I have no trouble getting HD streaming through Amazon with the built-in wi-fi.  You can look up the full list of apps via the Viera Connect Apps Navigator on Panasonic's website.==Conclusion==The TC-47WT50 is priced and performs as a high-end flagship HDTV.  It is capable of producing an amazing picture that rivals anything produced in the last 2 years.  I'd recommend this model to anyone looking for the best combination of picture quality and features regardless of price.  I recommend professional calibration and external speakers, but performance is impressive out-of-the-box.--My Settings--Note: I am not a professional calibrator.  These settings reflect my best personal judgement and preference.  I recommend them as a reference for your own custom settings.  Correct calibration settings vary from one TV to the next, often greatly.  My CIE diagram and IRE chart can be found in the product page pictures.  Please leave a comment if you have questions or advice.  UPDATE: I found that pushing colors to the full CIE range caused pixelation as colors approach the pure primaries.  So, color accuracy is the only real negative of this tv (especially getting truly blue blues) but should not affect most viewers.CUSTOM MODEBacklight 20-60 (adjust for ambient light)contrast 90brightness 54Color  50Tint  -3Sharpness 20  (set higher for SD content)Color Temp warmColor Mgmt offa.i. pic offCATS  off  (does not work for my tv's location)Advanced Picture Settings:motion  weak1080p pure d.  off  (set to on for 4:4:4 input)black level lightPRO SETTINGS:high r +6high b +6low r -1low b -2hue:  red  0, green 38, blue -5saturation:  red 3, green 7, blue 30black extension  0gamma adjust 2.4panel bright lowcontour emph.  offAGC  0color detail:hue:  yellow 26, cyan -25, magenta 31saturation:  yellow 15, cyan 15, magenta  0luminance:  red 15, green 5,blue 24, yellow -6, cyan -10, magenta 0", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Week in Use", "Author": "J. Jones", "ReviewID": "R3PD4D5BAPOO3O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been researching new Smart TV's for about 2 months and like most people on a mission to find a good TV you have to weed through all the reviews and opinions found on the web.  CNET, Amazon, HDTV forums and even watched the entire 2012 TV shootout videos on YouTube.I kept going back and forth between plasma and LED/LCD.  I was ready to take a chance on Panasonic plasma when my March edition of Consumer's Reports showed up in the mail.  In the 55\" to 59\" category of ratings Panasonic took the top 3 places with the VT plasma, ST plasma and WT LED.  It was also very interesting that the Panasonic WT is also the only Panasonic LED TV to make the HD Shootout (which was won by a Panasonic plasma).So decided this TV was worth a look.  Headed to a local Big Box store and must say I was impressed with the picture on this TV hanging on the wall in the \"High-End\" section of the store with the top rated plasmas and Samsung LED and Sony's top of the line LED's.  I was armed with Amazon's online price and decided I would buy this set right then if they would match the price (they were $400 higher).  After they decided to let me walk, I went home and got online and ordered it from Amazon.Two days later I received an email from the delivery company asking me to schedule a time to deliver my new TV.  We scheduled a day for the early part of the following week.  Can't beat this kind of customer service.A couple of days went buy and I noticed that Amazon had dropped the price by $100 so I sent them a quick email and the next day I had a response stating they were issueing me a credit for the $100.  Great!Two days later, the price drops another $140 so shot off another email and a qucik response with an additional $140 credit.TV gets delivered on time and in perfect condition.  Could not ask for any better service from Amazon or the company they used for in home delivery.Now for the details.  The picture on this TV is awesome right out of the box in Cinema mode.  Vivid is a little too Vivid for me. Black levels seem fine and popped in the Dark Kight Returns just to see if I could witness any of the negative comments from Cnet on this TV.  It was perfect, even with my glasses on...........I then decided to try some recommended picture calibrations found online and after a few hours settled in on Cnet's calibration for Standard mode.  I just did not like the Custom mode recommendations.Viewing angle of this IPS LCD panel (with LED backlighting) are very good and almost as good as plasma.Now for the summary.  This TV is as close as you can get to a plasma quality picture and viewing angle without the worry of potential burn-in if you watch a lot of old programming or news channels with stationary logos.  You won't be disappointed.By the way, this TV is now over $500 more than a paid a few weeks ago.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Panasonic TC-L55WT50", "Author": "n0b0die", "ReviewID": "R2KYMNPN83J1P1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV has taken a beating by professional reviewers such as CNET and had I not seen this TV in person, I would not have ever considered buying this TV. If you watch TV in a bright room and never watch movies in a pitch black environment, then you need to consider this TV for your next purchase.  This TV is one of the best if not the best performing HDTV in medium to brightly lit environments.  The sharpness and clarity of the WT50 picture quality is one of the best that I have seen and the viewing angles are unrivaled among LED/LCD TVs.  The main knock on the WT50 is in its black level.  When viewed in a dark room, the black levels are average at best but add some light to the room and watch the black levels turn inky black.  Panasonic has done wonders with the Clear Pro panel filter in this regard.  So in short, if you like watching TV in a dark room, this TV isn't for you. But, if you're like me, and always watch TV in some kind of lighted environment, then you should definitely consider this TV.Note: I didn't buy this TV from Amazon.

Suffice to say, the picture is beautiful, the tv is light and thin, and the resolution is amazing (I really love the 'soap opera picture', though others don't).My review will focus on some of the apps available in the Viera Tools section of the tv's menu.  I use a Roku for Amazon tv, Netflix, and Plex (a media streaming program).  I own the HD Roku, and HD shows looked pretty great on my Samsung HD tv.  They look even better on my Panasonic tv.  But, you can bypass the Roku altogether for both Netflix and Amazon if you have a Panasonic tv - these apps are now built in.  Should you replace your Roku?  For these apps, sure.  Because you aren't getting them through a cable from another device (with its own picture limitations), the streaming is directly to the tv, and the picture is better.  The interface for Amazon tv and Netflix is also a little better (more menu options).  I miss the 'plunk' click noise on the Roku apps, because the Panasonic apps use a really piercing, annoying 'ding' when you click a menu item.How is load time?  Here, the Roku wins.  When you click a title in the menu on your Roku, the video loads.  On the Panasonic, you click a title, then the tv performs a connection speed test.  This takes a few seconds, or quite a few seconds.  After that THEN the video loads.  My gripe here is the same as my gripe with the Roku:  if the tv determines that your internet connection is not great at the moment, it will automatically load degraded video.  The Roku does the same.  I would like the option of waiting longer in order to load the HD.  I don't want to purchase HD, then watch it in SD because my internet spazzed out for a few seconds.  I want to choose my connect speed manually. Another weird element to the Panasonic Viera tools is that when you turn it on, it nearly always wants to perform a connection test.  Usually mine fails.  But if it fails and I skip out of the menu, then open the menu again, magically the connection is re-established.  This is a glitch that regularly happens, but doesn't particularly affect the quality of experience.Plex, however, is not available for Panasonic Viera.  Viera charges apps for development and inclusion, so you won't see a Plex app anytime soon, since it's a free app available on a few platforms (Roku, Playstation 3, etc.).  So if you care about using this app, you'll still need your Roku. For those of you unfamiliar, Plex is amazing - it allows you to use your computer as a media server, then streams this media to your device running Plex.  Some may argue that you can do this by plugging in a USB key to your tv (the Panasonic has USB 2.0 slots), but the number of file extensions the tv will play from a key is small.  Plex will play just about any type of media file you throw at it.  So I use Plex on Roku to watch downloaded items on my tv instead of my computer.  How do these files look on the Panasonic?  It depends on your file size, but even with a very large file, you're going to get a mildly grainy picture unless you tweak the tv settings A LOT to soften the picture.  The picture quality will basically be the equivalent of an SD network tv option or SD Amazon digital item.In sum: should you use the Panasonic Viera tools instead of getting a Roku with your tv?  Yes.  Viera has YouTube, Amazon on Demand, Netflix, Pandora, all things that people tend to use a Roku for, and the interfaces for these apps are better on the Panasonic than the Roku.  Unless you are planning to use experimental apps, don't bother with the Roku.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "KM \"KM\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q5FPLPMQWPH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought it in February 2013 for $900 from Amazon and it was delivered in 2 days (prime shipping ).

If you have some bright light sources in front of the set, you're most likely to notice the reflections on a dark screen.The only complaint I have is with the service that delivered and setup the TV. They were clean, curtious and prompt, but didn't know how to install the simple base that came with TV. They only installed the screws meant to hold the plastic base cover (which do attach moderately to the TV, and hold it in place minimally) in place and did not install the screws designed to actually hold the base to the TV. I was very lucky something was not damaged because of this, as the mount was extremely loose and wiggely.

Adams", "ReviewID": "R19QPZ3G8YH9YZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's the deal... I don't profess to be a TV expert. I can't really wax poetic about image processing, backlight scanning, speaker output, etc. But what I can tell you is that the 47\" Panasonic VIERA TC-L47WT50 is one AWESOME TV! Here are a few of my key observations:PROS:- LED HD Picture: It's simply astounding! SUPER clear. Black levels (I do know what those are!) are very solid.- Viewing angle: I know I can watch it from the side, and the picture is still great.- \"Smart\" functions: Built-in Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, YouTube, Skype, Twitter, Facebook, Web Browser, AccuWeather, and more... just... WOW!!- Built-in Wi-Fi: I'm able to connect to my home network without running cables, and maintain a solid connection. Nice touch!- Multi-task function: You can really do multiple things at once!- Size: This thing is amazingly thin, has a very small bevel, and a nice light at the bottom.- Remote: The primary remote is back-lit with red light (light button glows!) and very intuitive. I had no issues figuring it out.CONS:- I feel the TV could use a few more inputs, primarily for component video. As it stands, I can not hook up both my (original) XBox and Wii without HDMI converters.- I wish the TV had a simple audio-out so I could output the audio to my home stereo. As it stands, it comes out hollow and echo-y when I tried this configuration using the component audio-out.- Motion smoothing: Perhaps I've just not figured out how to tweak this yet, but sometimes the picture and things look \"fake\". Kind of an odd panning motion. It's just so clear, it looks odd. It's not bad, it just catches my eye sometimes.- It would be nice if the TV came with at least one pair of basic 3D glasses (not the active shutter, but just the basic glasses).Worth noting:- Sound: The \"3D Real Sound\" isn't bad. It's clear, I just wish it were a bit louder and had more bass. But it is not distorted by any means, which is good.- Viera link: I don't have a Viera-compatible home theater system, but I sure wish I did! This looks like one sweet feature.- VIERA Touch Pad Controller: I haven't needed to use this much, but believe it would be more handy if I had a Viera-compatible system.- Smartphone Remote Function: This is a very nice extra feature, as well.- 3D functionality: I do realize that this is a 3D TV, and certainly wish I could attest to those features. Unfortunately, I can't spring for 3D glasses right now, and I do not have a Blu-Ray player capable of playing 3D. If I get a chance to test these features, I will update this review. However, this TV is NOT \"just\" a 3D TV. It's a great TV even without consideration of that capability.The set-up of this TV was SUPER easy. It literally took me about an hour or less from unboxing to turning it on. I didn't have to jump through any extra hoops to set up the picture -- it was perfect out of box! I set it up the day of the Indy 500, and was blown away. Watching racing, the NBA Finals, etc. have been so awesome, I can't wait for football season! The movies we have watched have all been great quality (1080p DVD), so no qualms there. And I'm sure with BlueRay this TV would really shine! I had no problem updating the firmware on the TV, or figuring out all the extra functions. They just worked. All of this is more than I can say about another name-brand TV I own, which was a real nightmare to set up.Overall, if you are looking for a TV in this segment, you can't go wrong with the Panasonic VIERA WT50. It really is cutting edge, and is sure to enhance your home entertainment experience.One final note: This is not product-related, and is not the fault of Amazon or Panasonic. But my TV arrived in a damaged box, with one corner crushed and punctured, and the foam inside broken. It was also left standing on end agaist the wall of my front porch, which seems like a silly place to leave an expensive TV.

I've purchased a few LCD/LED Samsungs over the years and been very happy with them.  I currently have a nice 3D 55\" Samsung LED TV in the family room and a 46\" inch Samsung LED TV in my office/media/rec room upstairs.  When I was given the opportunity to try out the Panasonic Viera,  I did so mainly to be able to game in 3D (PS3 and Xbox 360) up in the rec room.  My wife and I watch 3D movies on the 55\", but she prefers I don't game on that TV (irritates her).  I was very skeptical at first, but once I fired up the Panasonic my loyalty might be a bit shaken.At first glance, the Viera looks very nice and elegant.  I really like the thin silver bezel.  It allows you to totally focus on the picture.  Right out of the box, the colors on this TV just jumped out at me.  With no calibration or adjustments, blu-ray movies looked terrific.  Games on both my PS3 and 360 really popped.  Everything is passing through my Denon AVR 391 receiver without a hitch.  Everything looks and sounds terrific.  The TV comes with two remotes, one of which has a touch sensitive pad that allows you to navigate the TV's various settings and apps effortlessly (I don't use either very much).What about the 3D?  Unfortunately, this TV doesn't come with 3D glasses (unlike the Samsung).  Again, skeptical.  I begrudgingly bought a pair of $80 Panasonic 3D glasses.  I must say that the 3D looks very good though.  I've watched a few 3D movies (Sanctum, On Stranger Tides, and Tron: Legacy) and was very pleased with the image.  I played some 3D games on my PS3 (Resistance 3, Killzone 3) and again was pleased with the TV's performance.  I experimented with the 2D to 3D conversion feature, and it worked pretty well (Avatar), but it doesn't really compare to full 3D HD movies.  I can't say I've found anything that particularly turned me off about this TV (other than the fact it doesn't come with 3D glasses).", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Quality for a Reasonable Price", "Author": "carol gana", "ReviewID": "R2AWH3FFSLB7IM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I are very pleased with this TV.

I'm not a film editing expert, so I can't explain why this kind of viewing feels so different.

But I was so amazed by the quality of this TV thatI actually write my first amazon review.The colors are incredible and the picture quality overall is fantastic.To me (in a lightly lit room) the black levels look great contrary to some opinions I read in some reviews;Maybe cinephile might think differently, but to me they look great.Picture is great, the HD movie quality is astonishing, the motion smoothing isvery good, only sometimes it seems to be almost too perfect and creates this'home video' effect of being 'too real'.I only tested 3D briefly so far, but it looks pretty impressive. But I am not really into 3D, just wanted a nice new TV.If you want decent sound, as usual, you will need a good 5.1 or 7.1 speaker system andthe right receiver. However, I was quite happy with the sound I heard so far and I amlikely using the standard sound of the TV for most occasions.I researched loosely for some weeks and looked closely at Samsung's UND8000 and UNES8000 series as well als the Sony HX series, but liked this TV in the end best.pros: - Great design - Great picture - Nice feature set - Setup was easy and flawlesscons:Like the other reviewers I was a little disappointed that the 3d glasses are not included.This is mainly because it seems that other countries seem to have them included andalmost any review I read before about the WT-50 pointed out how nice it is to havethe glasses included.Since you need a new type of glasses anyways for this TV it is even harder to understand,it's not that many people would already have glasses they can use with the TV out of thebox.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic VIERA TC-L55WT50 Not for movies or viewing in the dark!", "Author": "D.

I couldn't get a plasma because of all the people using the set--there would be too much danger of burn-in. So, this model has all the tech specs that should let it compare favorably with the performance of a good plasma. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It is still prone to blocking with fast and busy images, like sports. It also shows mad banding when scenes get dark--most disturbing. Finally, there is light bleeding in from around the edges of the mask (in front of the LEDs), which looks like pools, or clouds of faint light that are always there in the dark, for all dark scenes, for fade-outs, in between commercials and shows. It's awful. I had Panasonic come out and \"repair\" it, which they did willingly. But all it did was move the clouds of light to new areas. The panel (and thus the mask) are so flexible and flimsy that I don't think they can deliver a panel intact without light bleed. I give it two stars because, as long as there is bright info showing, I don't notice the flaws. But I can't stand to watch movies on it. I definitely don't recommend this set for anyone.

You can see backlight bleed on this TV when you first turn on the TV, when you're watching letterbox content with black on top/bottom (most new blu-ray's have this), and when the screen goes black (in between commercials).That being said, the picture the other 90% of the time is amazing.  I put the 55\" version of this TV in my bedroom and we sit about 12-15 feet away from it.  The cable box broadcasts in 720p and the picture is incredible.  You really notice that some HD broadcasts are lower quality than others, but when you get a good one, it really shines.  I spent most of yesterday watching football in the bedroom for this very reason - it was like an artist painted a dancing portrait right on the wall, vibrant and amazing.  Blu-Ray / 1080p content is almost too good, makes things look more real than real life, but you can't fault a TV for being \"too good\".I wall mounted this TV and just a tip for anyone who's looking to do the same.  You're supposed to use M8 (Metric 8) screws that are maximum 8MM in depth.  I looked and looked at local HW stores and couldn't find any with this spec.  I ended up using M8 screws that were 16MM in depth and buying qty:4 2MM washers (the last one was a lock washer).  That seemed to work just as well but I was a bit hesitant at first.I thought the new VIERA swiping control would be cool to use but I never end up using it because it can't control my cable box or Blu-Ray player so just end up using my universal remote.I'm quite happy with the purchase and glad I didn't settle for a cheaper LED as we will be using this daily for years to come.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "This tv is amazing.", "Author": "caydenm23", "ReviewID": "R3HMCDBSDGREMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like all others i can't believe it doesn't come with 3d glasses i spent 1700 on tv and 3d glasses its kinda a shame.Other than that its a beautiful tv and picture is absolutely amazing.

Because you can view any of your iphone pictures or videos, or any of the websites that you are interested in on the TV.

This is our fourth HD set, but first LED/LCD, the others are plasma.  This is our second smart set.  First off, this set is light enough to be delivered by UPS and not a special carrier, box is only about 6-7 inches wide and about 60 inches long.  It was well packed but not like some where every inch of the set is covered in Styrofoam which you have to find some way to dispose of.The base was easily attached to the TV given how light the TV is, only about 26 pounds.  I followed instructions and put the TV face down (in my case on a bed).  One person can easily move it to a stand.Set-up is 8 steps which took about 5 minutes.  I really like that the TV asked are you connecting to a satellite/cable and you then just answered \"yes\" with the proper input set and you did not have manually go to the right input later.  Other questions were the basic:  language, country, time-zone, etc.  Wi-Fi set up was just as easy with the TV finding the network, connecting and asking for the password.  At this stage you must pair your Touch Pad which requires you to be within a foot of the TV, more on the pad later.Thanks to the set-up procedure when you turn the TV on the first time it goes straight to the right input and there is your picture.  There are so many picture options not sure I remember all:  standard, vivid, cinema, game (wear sunglasses on this setting) and custom.  The picture is great, it really pops, maybe a little less than a plasma, but so close its amazing.  One minor irritation is when you turn on the TV there is a box on the bottom of the screen telling you about your TV or how to connect a smart phone or how to do this or that.  I have not found how to turn it off.  Stays on about 10-15 seconds it seems.  There is an auto-dimming feature that gradually brightens or dims the TV based on changing light conditions, it can be turned off if you don't like it.The TV remote is well set-up and has the buttons where you expect.  The Touch Pad controller is for internet use.  The buttons, in my opinion could be better arranged, for example, the left and right buttons are on top and hard to find by touch.  But what really needs work is the touch pad, it is much harder to use than what you are used to on a tablet, I often over shot the target on the screen or did not get it to move the cursor enough.  Also typing a web address by moving the cursor and hitting keys on the screen is tedious.  I much prefer the remote on my other smart TV which has the TV remote on one side and an internet based controller with a QWERTY keyboard on the other.  The TV comes with the usual smart TV apps, connections are fairly fast and with the screen being so sharp easy to read.As for 3-D, like most, if not all TV's it did not come with even one set of glasses.  But that said, I got this TV not for 3-D and consider it a bonus I will get to later.While I may have given too much space to the minor problems with this set, overall it does deserve the 5 star rating.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful!  Can I say that About a TV?  Clear, Crisp, and Perfection!", "Author": "Jamie Wilson \"Shilom\"", "ReviewID": "R2T2AWSDPQHO1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As with the other reviewers, I also could not believe the 3D glasses were not included, given that it is a 3D TV.  It was free for us for review, but I'd imagine a payin customer spending that amount, well it certainly should have been if you were paying.  But I am not complainin on my end about having to invest in just the glasses having gotten the free tv, but it does seem silly like they should have been included.  The TV itself is So GORGEOUS.  Clear, Crisp, just BEAUTIFUL.  I love the way the channels themselves change, like a page being flipped, and I found myself just flipping through channels like a dang man just to watch them turn, LOL.  There are four different outputs for all your gaming and bluray needs, which that alone was amazing, since we have a PS3, Xbox360, gamecube an Bluray player, so wowee, don't have to disconnect anything when we wanna play with something else!  I like how sturdy the base itself was, an initially thought it might be too big for out smaller tv stand, but it took up the whole stand and held the tv perfect.  The tv looked much heaver than it was, and is very thing and big, but stays sturdy in the stand.  I simply love love love this tv and cannot say enough good things about it.  There is stereo surround sound, available closed captioning, you can change/adjust the screen view for video gaming/movies, go from regular view to 3D of course, and on and on and on.  We played with all of that alone for some time.  Then to get to the internet capabilities!  Netflix, facebook, all this at the touch of an inluded mouse!  Yes, it comes with a mouse but not 3D glasses (insert eyeroll here), LOL.  But wow, amazing!  I don't think I want to go back to my little laptop or desktop EVER again!  It reminds me of the old days, what were those tv internet things called again with the wireless keyboards?  I used to have one but I forget the name...  I digress.  This so tops that.  You can instantly access youtube, everything.  Of course, you may still need your PC for, you know, functional things such as Word and documents; but you can play music an upload photos right on this amazing TV as well!  It is the best thing ever!  I will never part with it, ever!  I am securing my house and Ninja'd it in under a blanket so the neighbors knew not what I had and am protecting it from evil as we speak...  My precious....  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Just be sure to buy glasses with it.  And stock up on Blu-Rays.  Oh, and you WILL be calling off work when it arrives.  I am not the biggest tv/movie watcher, but I did not go to bed last night at all.  I am stopping by Blockbuster on my way home an getting a little something to slip into the Blu-Ray player and me, it, and this bad boy are having another all-nighter tonight.  Must Have.

They are bringing me out another one this week and I will update this post after.I received my exchange for the TV that wasn't working-This TV has an great picture. I guess I just had the lemon on the first one. There is a slight glare from a window from another room in my home. I have the TV mounted in a corner.but other than that,I love the TV.

Read all the excellent reviews.All I did was swap my old TV with the new one, leaving all cables etc. The Picture quality of the Panasonic is so much worse! The image is pixelated, out of focus, transitions show pixels, etc. Tried several cables, two cable boxes, a gazillion settings, still the same. The 10 year old TV is clearly better. We are soooo disappointed right now and I will return this TV. Also, Skype does not work, it has been giving me the same error massage for two days, that i cannot log on and I need to wait a few minutes and try again.Update: I spent one hour on the phone with Panasonic support today and the basic message was that I was wrong to expect a 2012 LEC/LCD to perform as good as a plasma TV from 2002. Also, they were not able to help with the Skype issue. They blamed it on my account being expired (which is complete nonsense, since I am using it every day on mt laptop....).Now the TV is boxed up again and it will go back to Amazon tomorrow.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Full HD 3D\nIPS LED Panel with Local Dimming\nVera Connect with Built-in Wi-Fi and Web Browser\nThin LED Design: TV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 48.7-Inch x 28.6-Inch x 1.1-Inch, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 48.7-Inch x 31.6-Inch x 13.2-Inch", "Name": "Panasonic VIERA TC-L55WT50 55-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Full HD IPS LED TV (2012 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fh-DfhafL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00752RAX6"}}
