Hooked to 3d Panasonic Blu Ray player and picture phenomenal. One caveat, the bluetooth for the 3d glasses does not work.  Panasonic support has been great working with me in trouble shooting this problem.  Panasonic made all arrangements for Tech to come and repair.  Will update once fix is complete. UPDATE: Main board was replaced and bluetooth is working now. It was not as bad as it sounds, the Tech brought the right part with him and it took about 30 minutes. I took off 1 star due to the problem but would not hesitate to buy another one of these TVs.  I've been waiting for several months for Panasonic to put their 2012 lineup on the market and I'm glad I waited. I have 2 other Panny's and the picture is great on all, but especially this one. Almost forgot, the 3D is spectacular on this TV especially with 3d movies.  The 2D to 3D is ok but a little hard on my eyes.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dont quite agree with CNet", "Author": "Ananth \"AA\"", "ReviewID": "R1VYWIL86SQWZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my 47\" TV yesterday. On seeing the cyber monday deal, I was also in two minds given Cnet's scathing review. The TV seemed very good on paper. However, I wanted to get more opinions, and noticed that even though many others had mentioned the contrast issue and black levels, the TV was rated very well. Just as some one else mentioned in a recent review, the avforums review seemed very balanced and comprehensive. After that, I decided to just try it out.I did have some delivery woes with UPS, and their not-so-careful handling of my package right in front of my very eyes! But the TV is great. I hooked it up last night and it looks great! The design is very sleek, the panel is very glossy, and the images are very good. I spent some time looking at the various picture options, and the sliders for contrast, brightness, sharpness, backlight control. Out of the box the colours were great, but with the customization, they were brilliant. Even the black levels are quite good.Setting up the internet had one small hitch. The TV was not getting an ip address from my router automatically. I manually set it up, and it was online in a flash. I also downloaded the iPad app for the viera remote, and it is really handy. Particularly to type stuff on the iPad and send it to the browser on the TV!Played some HD content on the youtube app as well as the youtube site on the browser. Both worked great. Setting up the amazon instant video account was a flash as well.Tried HD channels like AnimalPlanet, NBC, Nat Geo etc, and the rendering of the closeups, the crispness of the images was very good. Dark scenes had excellent blacks as well. The lighting in my living room is average - low light.I am yet to try 3D and full HD DVDs. Will update if I find anything interesting.The one thing I have noticed though is that the backlight on the right end of the panel seems a bit \"glowy\" compared to the rest of the panel, when nothing is on. I reckon it may just be something that may go away once the TV has run-in a little bit. However, it has not affected the images as far as I can tell.Overall, am quite glad I did not listen to CNet this time around.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Nearly Flawless TV", "Author": "Conner Macleod \"Afficionado\"", "ReviewID": "R2NH2EZZ6YSY0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic VIERA TC-L47DT50 47-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Full HD IPS LED-LCD TV is a great TV and if it wasn't for a few detrimental flaws, it'd be perfect.It generates outstanding clarity, brilliant colors, deep dark levels and is sufficiently bright when it needs to be.In action scenes and sports it excels when it comes to producing fast moving moments.  The 240Hz refresh rate is what makes this magic happen, and it's a noticeable improvement over the older 120Hz refresh rate which I had on my previous LG LCD 42\" TV.If you're wanting Internet apps, then this TV delivers that in spades.  Not only do you get the biggest favorites like Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Video On Demand, but you also get Cinema Now, Vudu, Pandora, Skype, Youtube, and literally dozens of other options that you can download and install via the wired or wi-fi network capability.  Netflix in particular is much faster and easier to use with this TV compared to my older LG.  There are numerous games to choose from, mostly your basic games like chess, but a neat feature nonetheless.  There are sport apps such as Major League Soccer, MLB, etc., with most of them being free.  The interface is fast and intuitive, very easy to learn and use even if you've never used such a feature before on a TV.  It even has Skype so you can communicate with friends over the Internet on the big screen, which is much better than simply doing it on a regular PC monitor.As far as the 3D aspect goes, it looks great, but personally this isn't the feature that I sought the most, it seems to be more of a gimmick at this stage than anything, but having said that this TV is at the top of its game in terms of that technology.  There's also a 2D to 3D conversion feature, but it doesn't look that great.  I tested this with the new film 'John Carter' and while the film itself looks absolutely amazing on this screen, the 2D to 3D conversion fell flat.One downside to having a larger TV like this is that older shows, especially DVDs and VHS films do not look so good on it, and this is primarily because the resolution is so high which makes the low resolution of the older mediums really stand out like a sore thumb.  This can be circumvented by using composite or component cables instead of HDMI when viewing lower res shows, but keep in mind they will look grainy when using HDMI cables.  This wasn't an issue on my previous 42\" LG LCD since it had a smaller picture and therefore the difference wasn't as noticeable.  Blu-rays and HD satellite channels on the other hand look picture perfect, same goes for Netflix movies and TV shows that are in HD.The overall design of the TV is aesthetically pleasing, clearly the creators went to great lenghts to ensure that this is an eye-catcher and will complement any room's decor.  What I really like is the thin, minimalistic metal bezel, aka frame, of the TV, which gives the illusion of the display to almost blend in with the background.  For such a large TV it's extremely light weight which allowed me to easily carry it around my living room.  Its thinner and lighter than any other TV I've seen so it's easy to see that this is state of the art technology.It's incredibly easy to put together if you want to use the metal stand (it only needs 4 phillips screws), which I recommend because the stand itself is very elegant looking and adds a nice touch to its futuristic look.Another advantageous feature is the compatibility it has with certain brand receivers, such as Onkyo, which allows the TV's remote control to control the volume of your home theater.  The way it works is that you turn on your TV and satellite receiver first, then turn on the home theater receiver and the TV automatically switches from the TV volume to the receiver's volume, which I thought was a nice and useful touch.For the techies out there, one of the coolest features of this TV is the ability to download Panasonic's remote control app, which works on smart phones and tablets.  Personally I've been using my iPhone to control the volume and change the menus.  To be perfectly honest though, this is more of a gimmick, it's not as responsive or easy to use as the main TV remote control, but it's there for that coolness factor if you want to surprise and impress your friends and family.This Panasonic functions like a media center, you can plug your USB drives into it and watch movies, play songs or look at your pictures, or you can even connect it to your PC as long as it's DLNA compatible, which doesn't include all PCs but it's been a fairly common standard for the past 2-3 years.  To find out if your PC is compatible, simply go to your manufacturer's website and look at the FAQs or specifications, or Google a review of your PC.  The wi-fi is built in so there's no need to mess with any USB wi-fi adapter, or you can run a network cable if you wish to directly connect to your router or switch, but wi-fi's definitely the way to go.  It's fast, easy to use and there are no cables to worry about.  As long as you know your wireless router's SSID (network name) and password, it's simple to connect, much like connecting your laptop to the wireless network.My main gripe with this TV is that it doesn't have much shielding/protection against EMI (electromagnetic interference) due to its super thin design.  I made the mistake of putting one of my Onkyo satellite speakers too close to the TV on the right hand side and that's left a permanent, large, white/grayish discoloration on the bottom corner.  I immediately moved the speaker away when I noticed it but that was a few weeks ago and it hasn't improved at all.  I've researched this and according to all the experts, LCD TVs are not susceptible to damage from the magnets in speakers, but there's no doubt about what happened because it wasn't there before the speaker was placed there, and I never had that problem on my previous LCD because it had a much thicker plastic bezel to protect it.  Having said that, it's only noticeable during pitch black scenes, which are rare, 99.99% of the time you can't see it because most programming isn't purely black, but nonetheless I think it's important for potential buyers to know this so they can prevent making the same mistake I did.  Also I hope that Panasonic takes a look at this to correct this defect in future designs.The built-in speakers are quite good, but as with most TVs, if you want excellent sound you'll have to get a home theater surround sound.As far as the menus go, it's quite similar to other LCD TVs, very intuitive and easy to use, in fact it was quite similar to LG's menu interface, so the learning curve is small.Since this TV has the IPS technology, the viewing angle is extremely good, and the picture can be easily seen from virtually any angle, unlike older LCDs and plasmas which you'd have to be more or less in the center to see it properly.It has built-in power saving features which you can set to turn it off automatically if there's no activity/signal for a pre-determined amount of time.  In general it uses much less power than older LCDs (up to 25% less) so despite its size, it won't cost much in terms of electricity.If it wasn't for the discolored white spot in the bottom right portion of the screen caused by the speaker's magnet, I'd give this TV a 5/5, hands down, other than that it's picture perfect.  I highly recommend it, just beware of your speaker placement, and keep in mind that older DVDs, VHS tapes and older TV programming won't look so good through HDMI (use component or composite for the old school SD (standard definition), but if you have HD satellite, cable or blu-rays, then this TV will impress to say the least.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Design----Horrible quality", "Author": "MAX SMART", "ReviewID": "RI1GFOQM54LO9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV last week, the design caught my eye, I really like the style of this TV.  The colors and brigtness is really good compared to my previous panasonic plasma, however it has several flaws:Cons/flaws:- TV shows yellow hot spots on the bottom of the TV, I guess they made it to slim and thin, so the backlight LED's leak- Black levels are not very good, TV shows dark grey in black scenes, should be inky black- TV has flash light effect, and severe lighting issues, especially when viewing at night or on a dark screen- TV has a large white cloud hot spot on the right/bottom corner, not severe but totally annoying- TV developed a blue/yellow line in the middle of the screen, which changes colors from time to time, it's blue right now and creates a thin blue line on the screen.  I contacted Panasonic support and they have a technician coming next Friday to try to fix it.  I'm thinking the display is bad.Pros:- Great Desgin, thin bezel and only weighs about 28 lbs- Color accuracy and picture clearity are greatI really like the design and the color and clarity of the TV, so I will be giving Panasonic a chance to fix the issues with the blue line on the screen and the yellow hot spot leaks, before I decide to return the TV, since I got such a great deal for the TV.  I purchased for $800.00, it's definitely worth it without the problems, but it is definitely not worth $1,300 dollars.  No way.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible 3D Television", "Author": "H. Collier \"Bill & Holly\"", "ReviewID": "R22TUJOBS8U8HU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent several days researching every 3D LED LCD TV I could find trying to not only get the most bang for my buck but also a 3D TV that had all the current features and options available like wifi and smart TV with Internet browser and Internet apps and all those other features and options...  The first thing I'd like to say is even though this television is a bit less then other televisions price wise it's every bit as feature rich and beautiful and has an amazing picture as those for considerably more expensive.....Of course I'm an amazon prime member and with my membership I get certain perks like free one or two day shipping, and the amazing low price guarantee which means if I find the item for less on another website, or if the amazon price goes down within 14 days of the item shipping they refund the difference. I loved the TV so much I was going to buy a second one for our daughters room so I went to amazon to see if it were available in a 42\" because that's the size she wanted for her room and I ran on to my TV and the price dropped from $847.98 to $702.41 three days after I got mine so I filed my I found it cheaper claim for $146.00 and change and in a day and a half the difference had been refunded to my account which is amazing and a shining example of Amazon backing up their guarantees and the products they sell...Now on to the television, I thought about the 50\" inch screen size and I am glad I didn't because for a bedroom TV the 47\" inch is almost too big but its perfect and the picture quality is amazing, I've been buying Plasma and LCD/LED TVs for a decade now and every new one we buy just gets better then the last but with the Panasonic Viera TVs I am blown away and even though this one didn't come with the active 3D glasses I was able to buy two pairs for around $50.00 each which with the TV was still less then comparable feature models from other manufacturers we ordered Avatar and The Amazing Spider-Man and a couple other movies in 3D to go with the half dozen or so other 3D movies we already had so we could watch them when the new TV got here, the TV, glasses, and movies all arrived in two days or less from date of order and considering I ordered on Saturday and got everything on Tuesday is another testament to Amazon's customer service and everything shipped free with either one day or two day shipping.... I thought it would be a bit of work to sync up the 3D BluRay player, 3D TV, and 3D glasses and the movies but there was no setup or manual syncing required AT ALL!!! I plugged the BluRay player to the TV through HDMI cable, same with our Directv  HD DVR with added 3D service and then I put in The Amazing Spider-Man, turned on the TV and turned on the power on the active 3D glasses and I was immersed in 3D in seconds so there is no painful setup other then fine running the 3D settings if you want to tweak a little, but out of the box everything was amazing, another really nice feature with this TV is that it will convert 2D to 3D on the fly and with the 240 Hz refresh rate it's lawless and you can adjust the depth in settings so now you don't have to pay the extra cash for a 3D version of a movie because the TV will convert them as you watch with no motion blur or flickering at all, I didn't even notice too much difference between a native 3D movie and one converted from 2D to 3D, maybe a little less depth but it was still a really good looking 3D movies that I was watching on our directv satellite system as well as other BluRay movies....If you buy the Panasonic active 3D glasses they will charge from dead battery to full in 30 minutes or you can do a quick two minute charge that will give you 3+ hours of watching movies so that's pretty fast for charging up the glasses... There are really no cons that I can think of off hand because there isn't any I've seen so far but if I do find a con ill post it....I'm a technology guy and I always buy the newest best tech for my home and family and if you want incredible picture quality, and an amazing 3D experience with a feature loaded IPS LED/LCD 3D television this is a must have TV and you get a 240 Hz 3D TV for about the same price as other manufacturers charge for their NON 3D 60 Hz or 120 Hz models, and with the higher 240 Hz refresh rate you get much smoother picture quality...... Read through the amazon features description and download the manual from Panasonic to get a full idea of what this television is capable of and oh it's also a smart internet connected TV through wifi too, and has too many features to list here so do your research, the Panasonic Viera 47\" IPS LED LCD 3D TV with FULL HD 1080i/1080p is an amazing value and an amazing piece of equipment that you can't go wrong with.. I also purchased a four year extended warranty for it so it lasts long past the factory warranty....On a side note there was one little thing and I wouldn't call it a con or anything, but we were watching the TV and out of the blue it would just turn itself off every now and then, and I didn't have power saving on or anything but it just turned off, one time when I turned it back on I noticed a message on screen that said something like the TV has been shut down due to inactivity which upon going through the settings menus under ECO/Energy Settings I found two settings for no activity for 10 minutes and one for No Activity for 3 Hours so I turned them both to stay on and the TV hasn't turned itself off since so if your TV turns itself off just remember these two settings and it'll be fine... One thing I must say is BUY FROM AMAZON!!!!! And keep an eye on the TV because the amazon price fluctuates randomly and if the price drops then you should copy the link to the lower price and save them and when you have the lowest price then file your low price guarantee claim and within two days they will refund the difference, and again i filed my claim on friday night and by monday morning the funds had been deposited back to our account,  in the end I originally bought  my tv for $847.99 which was already a fantastic price, then it went down to $702.00 plus I also got free two day shipping which was actually more like overnight since I ordered it Saturday evening, if you pay out of pocket for overnight or two day shipping it can run upwards of $150.00 to $200.00 or more on a package this large and then I paid less then $50.00 per pair of the Panasonic Active 3D glasses and then got an extra $146.00 refunded to me from amazon.... Another side note, after I found the price on the TV went down to $702.00 a couple days later the price had changed again and was at $784.00 or something close to that, so as an example of amazon prices always changing I bought it for $847.99 and then it went down to $702.00 and then again went up to $784.00 but they refunded me THEIR LOWEST ADVERTISED PRICE on their site so again check daily and copy down the URL and save it along with the price the TV was at on the day you saved the link and then when you have their absolute lowest price then file your claim.... So anyway For $702.00 you can't barely get a good regular 47\" or 50\" LCD TV, so to get an exceptional IPS LED LCD 3D FULL HD TV for that price, well it's just amazing... If you aren't already an Amazon prime member then look into getting it because not only do you get great deals and lower pricing thats just for Amazon Prime members that regular amazon members don't get you also get free expedited shipping on lots of stuff plus their video on demand service which is like Netflix which by the way with this TV being a smart Internet TV it has the amazon video and Netflix video apps built in for streaming video, we have Netflix and amazon services and we use them both.... Anyway I've babbled on long enough and if I keep going I could find many more things to rave on about with this TV so ill end this now and just say if your looking for a fantastic TV and the great benefits from amazon prime then invest in both because its worth every red cent we spent, we've been amazon prime members for 5 years now and love it and have average savings that add up to several hundred $$$ each year plus all the great prime prices and deals and the video on demand service it pays for itself many times over each year for a measly $79.00 a yearI really Hope this review helps anyone who is looking for a fantastic television for a fantastic priceBilly CUPDATE!!!!!!Well now that its been about six or eight weeks since we bought this TV, I still have to say its the best TV we've ever bought and we've bought a lot of plasma and LCD or LCD/LED televisions since they became more affordable and the prices went down and were more reasonable.... So we've been buying this type of TVs for almost ten years, and technology just keeps getting better and better and even with that I don't see us wanting to replace this television with a newer better version, I mean it'll be hard to top this TV even with newer technology, I mean its already incredibly thin and the picture is amazing no matter what viewing light and angle, or what resolution or if your watching 2D, 3D or 2D to 3D conversion, and it has about every feature you could want for the most part and the software can be updated as it comes available so it's hard to imagine them getting much thinner or adding many more options or more hardware to newer model TV's, even the newest models I've seen so far I wouldn't trade for this TV because its pretty close to perfect in every way so far... Another thing I didn't notice at the time I did the original review is that the remote for this TV can control cross manufacturer devices without having to program codes into the remote, it just automatically works with other manufactures devices through the DLNA feature when connected through HDMI cables (I think DLNA is the feature) that allows you to control DVD/BluRay  players and other connected input devices through HDMI connections, for instance the TV is a Panasonic Viera 3D TV and our 3D DVD/BluRay player is a Sony and I can control pretty much all the functions of my DVD player without having to pick up a other remote or program a universal remote in order to watch movies or whatever else I'm doing because it automatically works without having to switch modes on the remote or anything else and it makes things a lot easier especially since this is a bedroom setup and I don't like the idea of having to have five different remotes on the bed or nightstand (TV, DVD,  Apple TV, Sound Bar, and DirecTV receiver) well it doesn't control my DirecTV receiver, but still I don't need five separate remotes to clutter up things.... Our DVD BluRay player has wifi and the apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, and all the other stuff like that and its always been kind of slow booting up the streaming video and music apps and stuff like that so we had to be patient when we wanted to use these features on our DVD player,  but with this TV its all a lot faster and smoother booting up the streaming media apps loading and watching TV shows or movies and I mean its a noticeable difference, with our dvd player it was really slow so we had to sit there for for several minutes waiting for Netflix to load and then another few minutes for the movie to load and start playing, also when fast forwarding or rewinding streaming media you have to wait for it to start playing again so you try not to do it because of that, but when using these same apps on my TV versus my DVD player it's only three or four seconds for the app to load and then for our show to start playing again... I could go on and on about everything this TV has going for it, but I'd be writing for hours...As I said in my original post, I spent a couple weeks researching TVs and trying to find one that had everything I wanted in our new 3D TV before I decided to try the Panasonic Viera and after buying it we decided to buy another one for our daughters room, we've been waiting for the price to go back down close to the same price we paid for ours before buying it because the price  went up several hundred $$$$ since we bought the first one, so we are waiting for the price to go down again before we buy the second one for our daughters bedroom....  I had decided I'd try to find a different model from a different manufacturer that is active 3D and has  most of the same features as this TV has and I've still not found another active 3D LCD/LED TV for our daughter yet that has the same or similar features and has the super slim profile like this TV has and I've really been looking hard day after day after day and I cannot find another television that even comes close to this one that I am willing to spend the money on, and most that even come close from other manufacturers is a lot more, but even if it cost a bit more then we paid for this one I'd buy it if I could find one anywhere as close to as good as my Viera TV so it looks like ill end up either having to spending more to buy a second one, or  ill have to keep waiting for the price to go down again, but even with the price being so much more then we ended up paying for ours the TV is worth the higher prices its selling for now, so what's stopping me? Well I set a budget for our daughters new TV and even thought its still a great deal at current selling prices I'm having a little difficulty with paying several hundred $$$$ more for the second one then we paid for the first one but if the price hasn't dropped by the time I get paid again ill end up just paying the higher price for the TV even though I could probably find one from another manufacturer that we could probably make work for our daughter and she might be happy enough with it I just can't bring myself to cheat her out of the enjoyment we get from this TV and I know if I did buy a similar TV made by another name brand for her I would end up being unhappy and saying to myself I knew I should have bought her the same model Panasonic Viera TV  we have,  its saying a lot for me to give in and pay quite a bit more for the same TV we have and I know I would end up being unhappy with a TV a different name brand because even though on the surface the specs read close to the same, anther TV from a different maker won't be as great as this one is... Actually I won't even consider the newest E5 series Panasonic TVs because they just don't measure up to the DT50 model we have, or I would have already bought the newest model available, it's not like our TV is an older model, its just not the most newest off the line 2013 models.. It's kind of funny to think that the newest models are in my opinion not as great as the DT50 model, almost like they went backwards and the newest models are not as nice as the last version? Anyway I hope this information helps someone choose a TV they will love and enjoy as much as we do ours and I know you won't be disappointed if you buy the DT50 model over the E5 or whatever their very latest models are now because they have some of the same features but not all of the same features that this model hasBC", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV but Panasonic Doesn't Stand Behind", "Author": "E. Tucker", "ReviewID": "R1WUPBM74VR89P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Part 3 Update 12/13/2012:New TV just arrived, a day late but that doesn't bother me considering Amazon upgraded me to next day for free, set it up and everything seems to working as it should.  There is still some mild buzzing coming from the power supply but this may just be normal for this unit (could someone else please check their TV and verify this for me? Put your head around back and listen to the top right corner near the vents directly above where the power cord is plugged in).  The light bleeding is completely gone and dark scenes are beautiful.  Tested the 3D and the WiFi to verify they too were working and both work wonderfully.  And since this review is meant to be about the product I am going to bump my review to 4 out of 5 but caution anyone who reads this that Panasonic's customer service is lacking severely!  They have yet to call me back (it has been over 48 hours now) and neither of the Panasonic reps have called me back (local and corporate).  So I guess to sum it up (for now) Panasonic makes one hell of a TV but they simply don't stand behind their products if it requires more than a simple fix.Part 2 Update 12/11/2012:So Panasonic sent someone out to my house to look at the TV.  While he was here he commented on the bulge and how odd it was.  Also listened to the buzzing and told me it was the power supply but shouldn't be doing it.  Since the bulge on the back was causing light bleeding and screen deformity on the front the repair man said most likely Panasonic would opt to just replace it.  He took some pictures to send back to Panasonic for review and said the next time I saw him he would likely be bringing me a new TV. I was very pleased and had nothing but good things to say about the process.  Until I got a call from Panasonic yesterday saying that the \"dent\" on the back is not covered and was caused by the store I purchased it from and for me to deal with them.  I explained again that the unit is not dented but has a manufacturing defect on the back that is causing issues with the TV.  I asked if he had even talked to the repair man from A&E; before making this decision because the guy that came to my house was in 100% agreement that it was not dented.  And that began the ridiculous back and forth phone calls that lasted most of yesterday and a good part of today.Just a few hours ago I got a call from Panasonic asking me if I was satisfied with the service that was performed on my TV.  I asked the lady \"What service?  You haven't done anything but give me the run around\".  She then asked if the TV was working and I said \"Yes, the TV was never broken but has a defect that needs to be fixed or replaced\".  She then asked if I was satisfied again.  I laughed and told her to have a nice day.  I called Panasonic immediately after and gave my case number.  I began the back and forth again with yet another rep that I had to explain the difference between and dent and a bulge just to be told that my case was closed.  I asked why and was told \"according to a survey it says you were satisfied with the service performed\".  I asked \"if I were satisfied then why am I calling back complaining about my TV not being repaired?\".  I was told that my case would be reopened and someone would be in contact with me in 24-48 hours.Unacceptable.I contacted Amazon and withing 10 minutes my issues have been resolved.  Since I ordered it direct from Amazon there is a 30 day replacement guarantee.  I have a replacement unit coming tomorrow and they are picking up the defective unit.  I knew this before calling Panasonic but I believe that if a product is faulty the manufacturer should be informed and handle the situation properly or else how are they ever going to know there is an issue?  Why should Amazon be the one to pay for their screw ups?  I am not done with Panasonic and will make it a point to take this up the ladder because they need to know how broken their repair process is.So as it currently stands:Product - 4 StarsAmazon - 5 StarsPanasonic - 1 StarAverage of 3.33 StarsI will update once I get the new TV and hope there are not major issues with that one.*Original Review*First let me start off by saying this is Part 1 of my review, I am giving it three out of five stars at this time.  I received the TV promptly after taking advantage of the Cyber Monday sale for $799 (TC-L47DT50).  Unboxed it with much anticipation, took my time setting everything up, re-running cables, moving speakers, etc...  I removed the protective plastic from the outside and noticed a bulge on the back of the display near the top (if you look at the unit from the back, locate the center most screw at the top then move to your left about 2 inches).  I sticks out about 1/8\" compared to the rest of the casing.  Almost as if someone left something in there and screwed it together.  I wasn't too concerned at first because it wasn't a dent and figured maybe the case was just a little bent when they put it on... I should still give it a try.I turned the unit on and was greeted by an amazing picture.  So bright and colorful, the images were silky smooth after adjusting the motion interpolation from strong to medium (strong had a little artifacting). I didn't really need to adjust the colors so much but did play around with the different pre-sets (cinema, game, vivid, etc...) just to see what Panasonic deemed proper.  I had to stop playing and head out to work leaving it for my fiance to find when she got home (it is her early Christmas present after all).I called her shortly after she got home and was given oh so much praise for such a wonderful gift.  She then proceeded to spend the entire day watching TV and playing on her PS3.  I got home that night and immediately noticed something I hadn't seen during the daylight.  A rather nasty bit of light bleeding through near the top where the buldge was (common among some LCD/LED tvs but never had I seen it to this extent).  I then noticed that the screen in that same spot had a hall of mirrors effect distorting reflections.  I became very concerned that the buldge I thought may had been just cosmetic was now causing some more serious issues.  I went up to the TV to get a closer look and while looking around I began to notice a buzzing noise.  I assumed it was maybe a bad connection on my speakers (I did after all move them around) so I turned off the amplifier and the noise continued.  I turned off the TV and the noise continued so I kept searching.  Not the cable box, nor the PS3, not the battery backup... what was it?  I decided to unplug the TV.  The noise stopped.  Something in the TV is making a buzzing noise that can be heard from about 8-10' away especially if you are near the side/back of the unit, even when turned off!I waited until the next morning and called Panasonic.  After a rather pleasant conversation with a service rep I was handed off to their Concierge center to have an appointment for service scheduled.  They are coming out to address the issues next Friday (due to my availability not theirs).  I was told that my issues were very odd (bulge rather than a dent, buzzing even when off).Rather than speculate I would rather wait until I get a decision from Panasonic to either fix or replace my unit and will then be able to better review the product.  As this week goes on I plan on using the heck out of the unit I have testing the 3D, internet, etc features and will report back.And just because it is bugging the heck out of me.  Who in their right mind compares an LED TV to a Plasma?  Really CNET?  Come on! (I obviously chose to disregard the, very biased, review from CNet when I purchased this TV).  And to all the people posting 1 and 2 star reviews for a product based on a review from CNET that you don't even own PLEASE STOP!  It isn't helping anyone!  If I wanted to read the review from CNET I would goto CNET, I want to see what fellow consumers who OWN the product have to say.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV, incredible 3D", "Author": "SuzieB", "ReviewID": "RJUL6DX7BA7DG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our first experience with a 3D TV and so far the Panasonic VIERA DT50 has not let us down.  It's beautiful and offers an amazing amount of features!The first thing that I noticed about this television was the clean design and the light weight.  It's about 38 pounds, so it's easy enough for one person to pick up - but it's not recommended.  Be sure and have someone with you to help you gently lift and put it in place.  The brushed steel base is very sturdy and attractive.  However, I plan to mount it on the wall.  I would never mount my 52\" LCD due to the weight, but this LED TV is just 1 inch thick, light weight, and made for the wall!  The picture goes all the way to the edges, with just a thin silver border.  There isn't an unnecessary wide frame that some TVs add just to make them look larger.  It's sleek, and I like that.  In fact, the television is so beautiful that I had to repaint my room to freshen it up!The picture on this TV is very clear and crisp, and the colors are vivid and realistic.  Regular HD is fantastic, and the 3D is amazing!  The TV did not come with the required active 3D glasses, so we had to purchase them separately.  HBO offers 3D movies, and we have watched several and have been very impressed!  The detail that popped out was just as good as watching 3D at the theater.  However, we tried the 2D to 3D conversion feature on regular movies and were not very impressed with that feature.This TV not only uses much less energy than other TVs, but it also doesn't generate heat.  I feel a lot of heat coming from my LCD tv, but this LED TV stays cool no matter how long it's on.The TV comes with several built in apps such as Netflix and Hulu Plus.  We are already subscribe to these services via a ROKU.  Having them built in eliminates the need for a roku box and extra connections that might clutter your console.  The built in wi-fi also eliminates more clutter.The built in web browser lets us go online and everything looks fantastic.  However, navigating the web with the remote control takes longer since there isn't a keyboard and mouse.  You can download an app to your smartphone to make a remote that you connect with via wi-fi, and it offers a small keyboard among other features.  I personally rely on my mouse too much to make this an enjoyable browsing experience, but it's nice to know it's there if I want to share something online with a crowd, or if my computer goes down.  Facebook, YouTube, and other popular internet features are built in as apps, with more that you can download.  If you only plan to use a computer to go online and not to do anything else, you can easily use this TV for internet access without even owning a computer.One odd thing about this TV is that it features sponsored banner ads on the bottom of the screen when you turn it on.  They only lasts a second or two, but it's kind of cheesy.  I've never experienced that on a TV before.  Anyway, you can turn the banner ads off if you know where to look.  Click the MENU button on your remote, then navigate to SETUP.  From there go to the next screen so you can select the ADVANCED SETUP selection.  You'll find the option to turn banner ads off and on.Overall, my only complaints have been the lack of 3D glasses and the banner ads.  I have control over both, of course.  I am very happy with this TV and when the time comes for me to replace my other TV (Samsung LCD) I'll definitely choose another Panasonic LED.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "55\" Is Brilliant, Inky Blacks, Vivid Picture, Perfect", "Author": "fernandothompson", "ReviewID": "R2VT2INYVXQ6GV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the 55 inch version on Cyber Monday.

Some reviewers also mentioned the TV has average black levels, but personally I don't have any problems with the TV's black reproduction.If you are considering buying this TV I would definitely recommend reading the AVFORUMS review as it provides great insight into the strengths and weaknesses of this TV, especially when it comes to the black levels. Some reviews also mentioned a color consistency issue which was apparently fixed with a firmware update, so to experience the beautiful color accuracy of this TV, defiantly make sure to update the firmware to the latest version.There have also been a lot of comments on Amazon about the CNET review for this TV, and I think CNET downright got its rating wrong.  My general observation is that CNET tends to prefer Plasma TV's and gives poor ratings to LED TV's, (like the other TV I was considering, the LG LM6700).  Other professional reviewers rated this TV as a good buy and AVFORUMS gave the TV a recommended buy.CNET and Televisioninfo.com are great starting points for calibration recommendations and I also used the Disney Wonders Blu-Ray to tweak the online recommendation as well as create some of my own settings.Wonders Calibration 1= backlight +58, Contrast +68,Brightness  +52, Color +34,tint +3, Sharpness +38, Color CoolModified Televisioninfo.com = backlight +100, Contrast +95,Brightness +32, Color +36,tint +3, Sharpness +0, Color Normal, AI=OnModified CNET = backlight +50, Contrast +74,Brightness +52, Color +35,tint +3, Sharpness +50, Color WARM, AI=OffWonders Calibration 2= backlight +27, Contrast +83,Brightness +80, Color +37,tint +3, Sharpness +50, Color Normal, AI=OffFor 3D, the TV provides a great experience. I have also tested both the Panasonic VIERA TY-ER3D4MU and Samsung SSG-4100GB glasses. Both glasses work fine, but the Panasonic's are marginally better as I find the wrap around design more comfortable for extended 3D viewing.

The picture is one of the better Edge lit LED TV's I've seen. Add in the Wifi, apps, 3D and the brand name and this might have been the deal of the year on a 55\" LED.  The room its going in is quite bright and has windows adjacent to the TV. My plasma never looked this good during the day because of the glare on the screen.Know what you're buying here. Its not a plasma and the black levels will never be as deep as one, no LED will ever be. However properly adjusted this picture is fantastic and I am completely happy with the purchase. The CNET review was either really poorly adjusted or a defective model or the firmware was updated to fix the issues they were having. They also reviewed it as a $2500 set, not the $999.00 it was selling on here for.  Make sure you update the firmware, adjust the picture with a calibration disk and enjoy.At this point I have not used the 3D feature or the Apps and probably won't any time soon (if ever) so I can't really review that stuff.

For example, two component video inputs are multiplexed into one component video output, three composite video inputs are multiplexed into one composite video output and six HDMI inputs are multiplexed down into one HDMI output.  The analog component video and analog composite video are not upconverted into HDMI digital video.Thus, your TV set would need the three different input types to receive all three from the AV receiver.This panasonic DT50 makes you choose between either component video or composite video input.  It has 3 or 4 HDMI inputs that are sufficient for my needs at the moment and can clearly receive the HDMI output from the AV receiver.  If you want to cover all your legacy types of analog video inputs, you will need an AV receiver that provides upconversion into HDMI digital video.The other issue I would like to mention is the lack of a headphone jack.  The analog TV this HDTV replaced had a headphone jack for audio output.  The only audio output is a digital optical audio output (TOSLINK).  I think the TOSLINK is great for a high quality audio output to the AV receiver but I am having trouble figuring out how to get a set of headphones to work with the AV receiver. A headphone jack is important to  me so that I can watch TV without disturbing my family as they sleep at night.  The DT50 does not have a headphone jack.  When looking to pair this with an AV receiver, this is a big consideration for me now - how to get a set of wireless headphones to work.  There is a blue tooth connection with the DT 50 that is used for signaling to the active 3D glasses.  I am wondering if they thought about transmitting audio sound signals over bluetooth RF for a bluetooth headset.  Don't have a bluetooth headset to try unfortunately.\"UPDATE: I was looking into using an optical splitter to duplicate the optical signal output of this TV - one for the AV receiver and the other for headphones.  It turns out that this HDTV supposedly supports HDMI ARC (audio return channel).  Accordingly, the audio from the TV should be sent back automatically over the HDMI cable between the output from the AVR and the input to the HDTV, assuming the cable supports it and the AV receiver does.  This vitiates the need for an optical splitter and extra TOSLINK cables but does require one to have a newer AVR that supports HDMI ARC as well (HDMI cable as well).  A digital optical decoder is still needed to receive the optical signals on the TOSLINK and covert them into 2.1 analog signal output for a pair of stereo RCA cables for the headphones.  Now if we can get the headphone makers to receive a digital optical signal and integrate the decoder/converter, that would be great. In fact, all audio signals should be transmitted over fiber optic cables for best results.  As I have yet to purchase a modern AVR with HDMI ARC, I will be using the splitter and extra optical cables for now.\" Assembling the stand was a little bit of a challenge given that it was my first 55 inch HDTV, two people required to lift it and place it flat to work on.  Also note, the box indicates that it should be transported in a vertical position and not a horizontal position.  I see how a horizontal position may flex the LCD panel and cause it to crack.  Moving this is going to be a challenge to maintain its vertical position so that the stresses are placed appropriately on the frame.However, the 55 inch LED panel is so much lighter than the 36 inch analog TV it replaced. It can be lifted by one male adult but is too bulky and flimsy to move by one person, particularly with the stand installed.The bottom line is that I received a discounted price on this 55 inch HDTV to take the jump to digital, but I am going to miss all the headphone input, all the A/V inputs, and the reliability (over ten years and still running) of my trusty 36 inch analog TV.Update: The speaker openings are on the back side of the HDTV.  They may sound better if mounted on the wall so that the wall can reflect the sounds outward towards the viewer.  If placed on a stand in a corner, it is may not be optimal for sound.  You are most likely going to want to use a sound bar in front of the HDTV or at least an AVR with speakers to hear the sound better.With this narrow of TV, there just is not much room for speakers and generating sounds.Update: If you download the app \"Panasonic Viera remote2\" from Apple's itunes for your ipad, iphone, or iPod, and you select the media player under the Viera tools, you can play music, videos, photos, etc. from it on your TV using the \"Mirror\" mode.  To do so, hold your finger on the song, etc for a while until selected in the app, and swipe straight up.  The viera app also provides a keyboard from which you can better use the web browser.  It also is a remoter controller.Update: I was indeed able to use an optical splitter to split up the single optical output into two and couple it into a Gefen Digital Decoder for headphones and into an old Sony AV receiver w/o the use of HDMI.  This will get me more mileage out of my old AV receiver that has 5.1 sound.  I will try to upload a picture.The more I use this HDTV, the more pleased I am with its purchase given the sales price.For an entry level 3D HDTV, I did not go wrong.  For this reason, I upped my star rating to four stars.I just hope its lasts as long as my analog TV.Update: This LED HDTV, like many others, are very thin and cannot support a center speaker.  I was able to mount with tape the WII infrared receiver bar to the top of this LCD panel.  However, a speaker stand (or wall mount speaker support) is needed to mount a center speaker of a surround sound system.  The panny stand only lifts the TV up about 3 inches above the surface supporting the HDTV.  Most center speakers bars are at least 4 inches high.  Setting the center speaker on the supporting surface in front of the HDTV will block a lower portion of the LED screen.  One needs to plan accordingly for the center speaker.  Presently, my center speaker of the 5.1 system I have is sitting behind the HDTV on the support surface so it does not block the LCD panel.  It sounds OK there but probably is not optimal.Comparison with Newer DT60:  The DT50 has a 240hz refresh rate that is better for sports and movement within the video.  The DT60 has a 120Hz refresh rate.  This is the main reason I purchased the DT50, that and its discounted price.  The DT50 uses active shutter 3D glasses while the DT60 is using polarized passive 3D glasses.  The polarized passive 3D glasses are less expensive and do not break when dropped.  The active shutter 3D glasses are supposedly better at reproducing the 3D images and remain being used in the higher quality WT60 HDTV.  A built in camera may be useful if one intends to use skype video conferencing calls or play interactive video games with friends but I don't intend to do so.  Voice recognized commands in the DT60 and WT60 might be an interesting feature, particularly if one finds remote controls difficult to use.  I don't have that problem and find the remote control for the DT50 satisfactory.Update 8/4/13:  The DT50 has a PC input. The user manual indicates that the PC input supports a resolution of WXGA (1366 by 768 pixels).  With our older PC computer we were not able to use that resolution, we were only able to achieve SXGA (1280 by 1024 pixels) at 60hertz refresh.  It is nice to be able to connect old PCs without HDMI to this system.  We attached a Mac Mini with an HDMI output into an HDMI input jack with great success.

But this one was not putting out a Bluetooth signal so Amazon immediately ordered a direct replacement. While that was being processed I noticed that one reviewer had fixed the problem by reseating the Bluetooth adapter. This is a 1\" x 2\" module attached to the lower end of the TV's back panel. So I loosened the one screw holding it, and reseated the connector. End of problem! Called Amazon to intercept the replacement delivery and all is well.3 stars for Panasonic; 5 for Amazon.For techie types: To check the Bluetooth connection one can do a system check by turning on the TV, then while depressing the volume down button on the back of the set, depress and hold the OK button on the remote. After a few seconds a list will appear with the status of the various internal components. The Bluetooth box should say OK. If it does and you still can't connect the 3D glasses you may have a registration problem.When registering compatible Panasonic glasses be sure to hold the slide switch past the \"on\" position for a few seconds to start the registration process. The glasses will not register if the switch is released in the \"on\" position.And, by the way, the TV is excellent. Sharp, great colors (I use the custom settings recommended by other reviewers). We prefer its appearance and picture to the faulty plasma we returned earlier. It's 2 inches lower and swivels about 15\u00ba either way.

So not even 6 months after I purchased the television I noticed a thin yellow line that goes from the top of the screen to the bottom. This line occurs on all inputs. I first started off on my nightmare of an ordeal with Panasonic customer service. I called and was disconnected 3 times. Finally when I got someone on the line I was already very frustrated but I understood that in order to trigger a technician visit I needed to do the trouble shooting steps (which I already did well before I called). As I started going through his steps and explaining that I still see the line he begins to tell me that \"I don't hear the volume, you know if we find out that you aren't being honest there will be repercussions...\" At that point I lost it on him and asked why would I have the volume up when I am on the phone? I was incredibly insulted and probably said a few things I shouldn't have but how dare he say that...Long story short I need one of their technicians to come to the house and of course they don't have one available for the area (which is bull). Of course he said someone from Panasonic would contact me to setup a date for a technician visit. I doubt they will but in all honesty Panasonic will never have to worry about me purchasing another one of their products that fails after 6 months again.Let me preface this buy saying I am not an audiophile, pictophile or any other kind of nit picky television buyer. However, I do know an amazing television when I see it and I see it everyday when I turn this bad boy on. This was my third television and first step away from the Samsung brand and I have to say that I am in no way shape or form disappointed. Not to mention I got it for an absolute steal from Amazon at $698. Apparently there is a CNET review rolling around the internet that absolutely destroys this television as an epic fail. I couldn't disagree more. The slim design and picture quality are amazing. I love that I have multiple HDMI and USB inputs. The television is located a good distance from my router so I have to be honest in saying that the connection to the internet is not all that great but I'd imagine if this were a living room television you'd be good to go in regards to the strength of the wi-fi connectivity.

They are frying my brain like a microwave so beware.Another thing that could be better is that they should have provided an earphone output like a 1/8 \" jack.

It is preloaded with the basics, Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, Amazon Instant Video and a few others. Other free and paid apps are available through Viera Connect Market.  Very intuitive interface with the remote. Wi-Fi is quick to setup and is very stable.  Without the stand, it is only about 30 lbs so you dont need a $500 dollar bracket for wall mounting.  Panasonic publishes several smart phone apps the coolest of which is the remote control app.  This app sets itself up by detecting the TV when your phone and the TV are sharing the same wireless network.  Its a fully functional remote, a keyboard, a game controller and coolest of all, streams all media on your phone to the TV through DLNA.  You dont even have to change inputs, it just overrides whatever you are watching and when done, it simply goes back to what you were doing.The picture is stunningly bright and clear. The colors are awesome. Customization is straight forward through the menus.  I have not had the oppportunity to check out the 3D functionality because the way I bought this TV, it did not include the 3D glasses.  \"I'll just get them later, how much could they be?\" I said...  They are between 50 to 70 bucks each depending on where and how you buy them... Keep that in mind...This is a fantastic TV but it also has it's first world problems as well.1.  The HDMI ports are on the back but very close to the edge making it difficult to hide the cables.  Thicker cables with ferrite cores will need to be bent very tightly to avoid seeing the cable around side of the TV.  This bend stresses the HDMI port itself and will likely cause some problems if not done very carefully. (Bend the cable first, then put in the tv).  90\u00b0 and swivel end cables may be a solution but you may end up with other problems as the ports are pretty close to each other.2.  There are no analog audio outputs for things like wireless headphones and or older, non digital audio receivers.  I bought a converter ($25.00) to convert the optical audio to RCA so there is a solution.  There are also no analog inputs.  Make sure you have a plan for the devices you plan for your older, non HDMI equipment.3.  The remote should have a qwerty keyboard.  It does not.  You can hook up a keyboard, even a wireless one in the USB ports so its cool, but they could have just as easily put a small one on the remote.See, First world problems...

They play favoritism towards certain brands/models, especially Apple.  Panasonic is known for their awesome plasmas but their entry into LEDs have made a stellar turn out.  Bought this TV on cyber monday $999 deal since this TV is going for over $1700 everywhere.  TV arrived on friday 11/30 and tested it out all weekend long.  You will have to change the picture quality to your desired preference and it's got like 5 different options to choose from, including custom.  You can even customize all of the options.  I have it set to custom and changed a few settings but that was it.Pros:-Stunning picture quality with extremely well accurate colors-Black levels are great on this LED TV, similar to Samsung and Sony LED TVs i've seen.  If you want much deeper black levels,  then you need to go with a Plasma.-240Hz refresh rate (motion blur) shown very well. Best shown in newer movies with true HD.-Ultra-thin beautiful design. Panasonic logo lights up but you can turn it off in options.-Smart-TV apps works like a charm.  Install Panasonic Viera app on your phone to control TV, as well as play your phone media on TV.Cons:-Honestly, none.I didn't test the 3D functionality on this TV since I don't have the 3D glasses.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm so confused on Cnet's review of this product.", "Author": "Abohu", "ReviewID": "R1G1ND0O9ZC3KX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The fact that CNET gave this product such a bad review scared the living daylights out of me after I ordered it, but I was right to question their \"unbiased opinion\". I know Panasonic Viera to be a high quality product in the LED TV arena and was shocked at the review. Last year I bought a Samsung 60' 3D LED on a lightning deal and have been bragging about it all year. The TV has an incredible picture and I got it for such a great price. This year the Lightning Deals were complete junk and nothing compared to last year. I had planned on buying a Panasonic LED so that I could have the Amazon app built in (which my Samsung does not have, Boooo!) and was hoping to catch one on a lightning deal this year. Needless to say I was dissapointed when there weren't any, but when I saw this come up as the Cyber Monday deal of the day I was shocked at the price. $999- ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I have been so sceptical since the day I ordered it but now that I've had it up for a couple of days I am more than happy with this TV. The bleed at the edges is such an over-exagerration. The picture is clearer than my Samsung and the design is second to none. I have no complaints. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this TV for the $1,600 Amazon is selling it for. One tip I would leave you with though would be to buy it from one of the other private seller's with a good seller rating. The one thing that I was completely bummed about is that I was charged Sales tax from Amazon. I'm in CA and this has always been one of the reason's I love Amazon. Chances are the private seller's are just flipping the TV that they just got from Amazon so if you can find a reliable seller you'll save yourself $100 or more.

Absolutely no issues in that regard.PROS: Sleek design, the apps are nice(although interfaces are somewhat clunky), picture is great, good menu options, really thin (both frame and thickness of the TV itself), 240 HZ is strong but not overbearing, pairing 3D glasses is effortless, 3D looks really good, and there's a good amount of inputs for various components.CONS: Glasses sold separately, glare from the 3D glasses, Remote control has no keyboard, HDMI inputs are so thin I can't put in one of my thicker cables, the Panasonic emblem glows at the bottom (kind of annoying.)Most of my issues are small. Biggest one is probably glare from the glasses, which actually affects viewing. I didn't really expect a keyboard on the remote, but it definitely would have been nice. Next up is finding a way to turn off the lit Emblem.I still think it merits the 5 stars, given the features and minuscule cons.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture.", "Author": "Ron B Gass", "ReviewID": "R2SKXDRRDQ47MR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome colour.

It even married up with some technology I diddnt think it would. Picture? excellent picture, blows my Samsung LCD away (two year old model). No, I did not compare this to the plasma. I see no problems with the blacks. If you want to find fault you will. Like the internet set up, took about five minutes to set up when I started and most of that was retreiving the wireless key to use.  Netflixs, Amazon, and Facebook now pop up on command. I am fast with the virtual keyboard so no problems for me with that. The remote is one of the best I have ever used.  What really supprised me was it linked up with me not having to put in any remote codes and, has a backlight button. The TV is smart. it automatically linked to my Sony 7.1 home theater and set up the sound to run through my home theater without prompting but gave me the option to us TV sound. The set up pratically does itself, Panasonic did a good job with the smart setup on this TV.Yes, the TV sound is about as good any other Tv of its class.  Again, I don't expect sound to come out the same as the seven Bose speaker peppered about my room, not realistic to expect such.My only complaints are (These are annoyances but not star breakers when looking at the quality of the product):NO GLASSES for 3D.  Come on Panasonic, this is your second best LCD/LED model. I believe this to be bad marketing for Panasonic considering every one else has glasses as an included accessory. I am wrote a reveiw on this on [...] but I think it got filtered out.NO MOUNT SCREWs: Three times to Lowes until we found the right ones with two Lowes' helpers working with me (great male bonding going over the instructions, marveling at my TV and finding the right screws, techie friends now updating them on this product when I go there.Three times was because the metric screw setup at Lowes had the ones I needed messed in with others so I did not see them, perfect storm for finding them the first or second time, still?)ONLY one COMPONENT/COMPOSITE connection.  I have two items which still need a component/composit connection Panasonic made a harness for the one connection which can do either one for the one combined connection but not both.

All  three had our must-have features, including  internet built-in, active 3-D, 240+ Hz refresh, and 46-47\" screen size.  They were all made by a top manufacturer and in the mid-price range. I have to admit this one was 3rd on our list.  Mainly because the regular price was considerably less than the other two for no apparent reason. They were similar size, had all the same features, and just as many good reviews, but the price still made us nervous.Since we had a modest budget, we waited until Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales to have a chance of getting more TV than we could have regularly afforded.  This TV went on sale for a great price and the other two sets didn't budge. There was nothing else we could do but buy it and keep our fingers crossed.  It arrived in one piece and right on time. (Thanks Amazon!)Getting the stand assembled and cables & other components hooked up was very simple and the documentation was clear & easy to follow.  We were ready to see how smart our new Smart TV was in about an hour (that includes the 20 minutes we argued about how to get it out of the box :)The set is very attractive and modern looking.  Not one you'll need to try to hide at all.  The silver colored frame is minimal. It seems to disappear when the TV's on. (It matches satin nickel fixtures quite nicely by the way :)It was so easy to get it connected to our network and get going on the internet.  All the apps are pretty much setup for you except entering your personal account information and making customizations.  We had Pandora, Amazon Prime, and Netflix completely setup and test driven in less than 30 minutes using only the remote control (and I'm remote control challenged!) Panasonic VIERA Connect service is very easy to use too.The picture is stunning! Streaming is smooth and effortless. It even looks great from when you're watching from off to the side. With our old set, if you weren't front and center you were out of luck.  This one doesn't seem to be near so reflective.  Some of the reviews we read talked about light spots on the screen but we don't see any even in the darkest settings. However, our living room doesn't get a lot of direct sunlight, especially this time of year. That may make a difference.There's still so much more to explore. But after a week we've decided,  we made the right decision.  We saved nearly half  of our budget,  got a great TV and got to open our Christmas present early.

I prefer the \"Vivid\" setting as it is really much brighter and the colors are very saturated.  The purest will probably say it is unrealistic with that setting but if you like a bright picture with bright colors kind of like you see in the stores display than I think that maybe a better setting for you too.

I have a Vizio SMART TV that is more user friendly as I don't have to click on activation codes and/or pay for apps that are free on other SMART TVs or boxes.  For example, the CrunchyRoll App requires me to enter an activation code on my laptop, then requires me to updgrade to a premium service when I can get this same app on other SMART TVs for free.  I also find it deceiving when they list the app is free to download but you have to pay for the subscription service.  In addition, Panasonic has less apps than Vizio.  Considering that Panasonic is suppose to be the superior brand, this should be the other way around.  Also, this this has annoying banner ads like the kindle when you turn on the tv.

It was absolutely beautiful.  The colors were bright.  I was particularly surprised at the brightness in bright light. There is nothing is the specs or reviews to indicate it, but is seems to automatically get brighter in bright light and softer in a dark room. I don't know what TV some others were reviewing, but several said the screen was side lite.  The specs on this TV clears state that it back lite.

Yes, you do have to purchase the glasses separately. Make sure you get the correct ones.  They must be active shutter and probably have to be the same as the TV brand.

The TV does do a really great job on providing excellent and vivid colors and excellent picture quality, but the critical issue is that it does not have local or micro dimming feature as advertised by the TV commercial on this site; local dimming is a must have for a LED TV, it controls lighting at different segments or zones of the screen, not just from the edges, which just basically lights-up the entire screen and results in uneven backlighting and the undesirable flashlight effect, the light seems unsure what it should be lighting or doing.  I also own the Toshiba 3D LED TV 55UL6100 that has fine local/micro dimming which I use as the main LED HDTV in my living room, and it has excellent lighting and shows nice inky blacks with no major clouding or flashlighting effect; you can pick that up at Crutchfiled for about 1,099 for the 55 inch or 799 for the 46 inch.With that all said, if you can purchase this TV as used and get it for $700 on sale like I did, then I highly recommend it, because it is definitely worth it.  I just don't see how it can be worth dishing but almost 1,400.00, your better off with the Toshiba 55UL6100 with micro-dimming at Crutchfield for only 1,099 right now.  I own both of these TV's and really like them, but for night viewing or movies with a lot of dark scenes, I only use the Toshiba that can utilze the local/micro dimming to provide those nice inky blacks like plasmas. [...]Pros:Weight - about 37 lbs without the stand, that is pretty good for a 55 inch LED TVGreat looks ---- aluminum and glass, I love the modern trim design of this TVDecent sound --- It sounded much better than I anticipatedPicture Quality is excellent---ONLY during daytime viewing, viewing at night or in the dark, makes the TV glow due to backlight issues, and kills the picture qualityCons:No THS mode for picture settings, I just wanted more options to be able to reduce the backlight clouding and flashlight effect, Very few adjustments/picture settingsSignificant backlight bleeding, flashlighting and clouding; simply kills movies with alot of dark scenes and seems to make the TV even glow atI would have probably returned it if I it wasn't for the great deal I received from Warehouse Deals, purchasing it in like new condition for only about 700 bucks, you just can't beat that anywhere.If you buy it used from Warehouse Deals, I recommend paying an extra few bucks for a (like new) condition TV, the one I received was as advertised in like new condition in original packaging and seemed to be basically a new TV, no signs of being used at all.  I think it's a luck of the draw on what you actually get, but worth the risk since Amazon has an excellent returns policy.If you can catch it on sale, I would highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not perfect yet", "Author": "ph", "ReviewID": "R2118XIZ5MLOPR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the TC0L47DT50 to replace my Sharp CRT television of 13 years so anything should be better, and I got a great deal here on Amazon by watching for prices to go down. I received the television in two days for free with my Prime account. The package was damaged on the bottom. I'm assuming this happened while in transit with FedEx. I'll post pictures. The set is very nice looking. I appreciate the CNet reviews but sometimes I'm not sure where they are coming from. It is sleek and modern. The overall appearance looks well crafted and it was easy to assemble. The blacks are an issue compared to Plasma's I've seen, but with three others in the family who wouldn't understand the steps to avoid burn in and image retention issues with a Plasma I felt the LED was a better choice.The problem is like others have noted, poor or uneven back light bleeding. It is most noticeable when watching movies in a darkened room, especially dark movies. This is my main use of the TV. Others watching regular TV programs or full 16x9 imagery will not see the problems as much. The bottom two corners exhibit lighter areas. The right hand side exhibits so much bleeding that it has the appearance of someone opening a side door in a movie theater and washing out the screen. I am able to reduce this somewhat by turning most of the other settings down and turning the C.A.T.S. option on which then begins to muddy the image. I am returning it for a replacement.Amazon's service so far has been fantastic. I began the process of returning it on line, saw an option to call for tech support. Within just about two minutes I was talking to a woman who was very helpful. She asked me to do a couple of quick tests. We confirmed that it was a problem, and she asked what I wanted to do. I told her I would try the same model one more time. She set it up for next day delivery (even without Amazon receiving the defective model first), but I actually asked for two day so that I could more easily be available for when it arrives. No problem on their end. I was sent an email while we were talking about returning it via UPS with all the needed information.Review of the rest of the TV: I have a Roku so didn't really need the Smart TV options. I'm glad I have the Roku. The Panasonic interface is very clumsy and slow compared to the Roku. I'll be sticking with it as my preferred way to get to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu. I haven't used the 3D, I don't have a 3D Blu-Ray player or glasses right now. Sound was fine but I will eventually get a sound bar or other reinforcement.I was almost ready to return it on principle alone when I saw ads popping up when I changed the volume on the TV but thanks to another user I found out where the option is to turn that off. I also promptly turned off the Panasonic lighted logo at the bottom of the TV.If the black light bleeding is taken care of with the replacement I will be very happy.UPDATE:I have returned the replacement. It too suffered from back light bleeding. Not as much, but still noticeable enough that my wife and nine-year old could see what I was concerned about. It was distracting enough that I had a hard time looking at anything else. As a result of the back light bleeding, blacks are uneven and often greyer then I would expect on a TV like this. I will say this is most noticeable with movies that are letterboxed or in general dark images. Pixar animations and basic HD TV look very good on it, but that is not the sole reason for purchase. I'm going to try a Samsung PN51E530 51-Inch Plasma TV. It's bigger, has no smart TV, which is solved with my Roku. No 3D but that's just fine. I'm getting a HDMI splitter to add additional HDMI input. I'm concerned about burn in but will take the necessary steps to prevent it. Hopefully I will find a good solution.Amazon service continues to be fantastic.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "JULIA BRAYBOY", "ReviewID": "R14DF460DMIZ66", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "With this TV I expected a lot more than we received.

This display was noticeably brighter than the plasma (no surprise there; plasmas usually are darker but have generally richer blacks), and has very deep blacks. The design is very attractive with a \"glass and metal\" look that actually creates an edge-to-edge feel when it's turned on. The plasma TV has a rather thick black plastic frame around it, in keeping with its much less expensive price point. I think that one has wide price range to get similar picture quality these days, so I would consider this TV rather pricey if picture is all you're looking for.We have the sound wired to a Panasonic SC-HTB15 Home Theater System mainly because it was what be got when we purchased the plasma display. We have never used this TV's built-in speakers; the sound through this sound system is very good. We got the optional wifi dongle with our plasma and it worked satisfactory at best, but not good enough to stream movies or use any of the Viera apps reliably.

Seems like the people that actually own the TV like it. Please only post if you own the TV!!!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought the 47 inch TV on Cyber Monday for $799 (now listed at $1,199), and FedEx dropped it off earlier today.  Not bad for Super Saver shipping (only took 3 days).As I promised, I am updating my review after I received the product.  After all the negative publicity via CNET and a recent review stating they had some physical blemishes, I was cautiously optimistic as I opened the box, but ended pleasantly surprised.Appearance - Sleek and stylish look with the stainless steel finish around the edges and extremely thin LED design.Picture - I must say the settings out of the box are not the best. The colors are kind of light and hazy looking, but as soon as you adjust them to your liking, the picture is bright and colorful.  I might add that the picture is very smooth.  I have seen other people that have 60 Hz refresh rate LED TV's and the picture seems to skip across the screen.  This does not happen on this TV with the 240Hz refresh rate.  You will appreciate this when watching sports or playing video games.WiFi & Apps Streaming- I was able to connect to the internet instantly and hook up to my Amazon Prime account.  The browser might not be as nice as the Samsung models I have used when visiting relatives and friends, but it is easy to access and does the job.  Viera is easy to use as usual.  Love this part about Panasonic TVs, as it is easy to navigate and find what you are looking for.  Some say the Apps are slow, but I have only owned Panasonic products (have never had problems with them, knock on wood), so I wouldn't really know if other brands are faster/slower, etc.3D - I have not tried this, and I can't say that I plan to any time soon.  It does sound like you can find Samsung glasses that are compatible for around $20, if I decide to go down that path.Stand - The stand has a very modern look to it with a stainless steel finish and very sturdy base.  I set it up initially on the stand, but plan to put it on my wall mount tonight when I have some friends over.  It is definitely too heavy and wide to mount it by yourself.  Two people is probably enough.Sound - The sound works for the room that I will have it in, as it is not that big.  If you have a larger room that you are looking to place this TV, I would suggest the 55\" model along with a surround sound package.Also - some people have noted a `buzzing' or `humming' sound while the TV is on, and even off.  I do not have any of that happening with this unit.Overall - I feel like I found a heck of a steal on Monday.  I was looking for a 47\" - 52\" TV for our main level Living Room in the $1,000 price range, and this fits perfectly.  I found a higher quality TV than I ever thought I would find in this price range.  If I went back and could do it over, I probably would have bought the 55\" model for another $200.  Oh well, the 47 inch model looks beautiful, and I am extremely glad that I muted out the CNET garbage that was posted all over Amazon when I was researching this purchase.

I made sure to email the delivery company (Pilot) my gate code, as they would not be able to enter without it.Much earlier than the time frame set for the rescheduled delivery, I heard pounding on my door. The delivery driver was upset that he had been waiting by the gate \"for an hour.\" I explained that it was still prior to the delivery window and he explained that they don't really follow the delivery window and that it could be earlier or later. I asked what he would have done if I had not been home. He stated it would have been delivered hours after the delivery window. What good is a delivery time frame when 2/2 times they can't adhere to it?Despite the shipping document indicating that there should have been a two-person crew to deliver the TV, I had to assist with getting the item from his truck to the curb in front of my home. While I am not rating the product based upon the ridiculous delivery issues, I figure they bear worth mentioning.After unboxing the product, I found that two sets of machine screws needed for assembly (of the stand) were simply missing. Rather than going through the hassle of dealing with that awful delivery company again, I figured I would call Panasonic and have them sort it out. I was told it would take 7-10 days in transit for the parts - after I send them proof of purchase. I sent them proof of purchase and when they eventually responded, they indicated the product was now out of stock and was not estimated to be in stock for the next 3 weeks! So with the 7-10 day time in transit estimate, we're over a month out. With a one year warranty, to be without use of the TV for the first month is ridiculous. If it fails to work one month out, my return period with Amazon will have expired.Part of what you are purchasing is the warranty service, not just the tangible screen. Panasonic fails so utterly at warranty support, that I must rate this product a single star, as I cannot even make use of the screen that was sent for a minimum of one month after delivery.
