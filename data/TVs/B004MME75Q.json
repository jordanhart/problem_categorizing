{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best 50\" picture quality in the U.S.", "Author": "Andon M. Coleman", "ReviewID": "R2LX3ZROAR803O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With SONY and JVC no longer manufacturing their phenomenal high-end CRT HDTVs, and Pioneer out of the Plasma business, the pursuit of picture quality is not as simple as it once was. Rest assured, however, that there are still a handful of manufacturers (i.e. Panasonic, Samsung, LG, ...) still investing in Plasma technology, because LCD is a giant leap backwards in terms of picture quality. When Pioneer - the previous undisputed leader in picture quality - left the industry, they sold their Plasma technology to Panasonic. While the amount of Pioneer technology (if any) present in Panasonic's current line-up is a matter of debate, most critics will agree that Panasonic currently holds the crown for picture quality.Viera Size Segmentation (VT30 vs. GT30 vs. ST30)------------------------------------------------I was in the market for a VT30 this year... however, in the United States, Panasonic's size options are quite restrictive. In Europe, all lines of plasma from the X up to VT are available in 42\", which is the perfect size for me.In the United States, each of the 3D model lines has a different starting size:  VT30: 55\" - 65\" (Industry leading black level, less buzzing, better speakers, 96 Hz mode for 24p, ISF calibration, ...)  GT30: 50\" - 65\" (Better black level, +1 HDMI port and VGA input, THX certified)  ST30: 42\" - 65\" (Entry-level 3D TV)  S30:  42\" - 60\" (1080p 2D plasma, worse motion clarity than ST30 and no 3D support)  X3:  42\" - 50\" (720p 2D plasma)Unfortunately, I can barely fit a 50\" TV where I have my GT30. I made the conscious choice of buying a TV slightly larger than I would have liked, because the GT30 buys you THX mode (which does a _really_ good job with skintones), an extra HDMI port, and a slightly lower black level than the ST30.Picture Quality---------------Getting back to picture quality, I have a SONY Super Fine Pitch FD Trinitron (CRT) set in my bedroom that I use as a benchmark for image quality.The GT30 does not have the pure black level or white performance of the CRT (or even many local dimming LCDs). However, color accuracy and black gradiation (i.e. being able to see fine details in shadowed scenes) are actually better than my calibrated CRT.Unenhanced motion clarity is indistinguishable between the two sets, and the GT30 earns a lot in this respect when it comes to displaying 24 fps material (48 Hz mode causes flickering, but even with simple 3:2 pull-down, the TV displays 24p video well).Panasonic has added a more advanced Motion Smoother this year, with two levels - it creates artificial motion enhancement similar to LCD 120/240 Hz, and therefore has limited appeal.Physical Appearance-------------------Typically I do not care about the physical appearance of a television (which is why I still prefer high-end CRTs to flat panels), but the design of this TV is definitely worth mentioning... compared to last year's GT25 model, this TV is lightyears ahead.The bezel has been shrunken on all sides of the panel, and the depth is equally impressive. Were it not for the speakers, and clunky stand, this TV would be about an inch deep. As a result, the television requires \"break out\" cables to attach analog audio/video devices, and the total number of analog inputs has been reduced to 3 (Component, Composite and VGA D-Sub). This does not bother me at all, since the only analog device I have connected to any of my TVs is a Nintendo Wii. The extra HDMI port more than makes up for it.I would also like to give kudos to Panasonic for putting the power button on the FRONT of the TV this year (it was on the side last year).Long-term Value (Viera Connect)-------------------------------Viera Connect is a promising new feature for 2011, that is essentially an evolution of Viera Cast.Consumers can look forward to a growing software base in the future (as Software Engineers like myself develop software for the new open platform). The beauty of this new platform is that it operates independantly of official firmware release schedules. This is important, because firmware updates for aging products are few and far between - 2010 and older Viera models will likely NEVER receive support for Hulu, etc...With this TV, two or three years from now, consumers can still download new or updated Viera Connect applications from the Viera Connect marketplace. Another thing I found nice about Viera Connect's marketplace, is that you can buy TV accessories (such as 3D glasses, SD cards, etc...) directly from software built-in to the TV, and rest assured that the product is compatible with your particular model.Sound-----Sound quality leaves room for improvement. This being the second-to-highest model from Panasonic, lacks the sub-woofer and higher quality speakers found on the VT line.Adding insult to injury, US Viera televisions do not have analog audio out, so to improve the audio quality you must connect them to an A/V receiver (which also draws a lot of power) that supports optical S/PDIF.In future years, I hope that Panasonic will consider improving the sound quality on the GT line.Power Consumption-----------------Power consumption is good, but definitely not great. This is the only performance measurement that local dimming LED backlight LCDs come out on top in. That said, Panasonic has redesigned the construction of their panels this year, to improve phosphor response time (reduces 3D cross-talk), and improve luminous efficiency. Remember that this TV uses tinted 3D glasses, which darkens the picture... so brightness is important in 3D.As a result, brightness is up, and power consumption is down vs. last year's model. Unfortunately, one consequence of the new design is \"fluctuating brightness,\" which occurs when the TV transitions from a bright scene to a dark scene - in extreme cases, it can take the TV multiple frames to recognize the change in brightness and adjust its image processing. This was irritating at first, but I hardly notice it anymore.Plasma Buzz-----------On a final note, I have noticed a lot of people complaining about plasma buzz. I feel obligated to point out that the buzz is especially bad within the first 100-200 hours of operation, and decreases somewhat over time.There are a number of factors that play into the buzzing, including altitude, viewing distance and picture settings. Granted operating altitude is not easy to change, but the buzzing can be reduced by sitting farther from the TV set, and dialing down the contrast setting (buzzing is directly related to how bright an image is).A lot of people have TVs too large for their viewing distance and have contrast set way too high, and only ever realize it when plasma buzzing or dithering becomes a nusiance.Pros and Cons------------------Pros:----- Plasma image quality  * Pure black level is not as good as CRT or local dimming LCD, but...  images with light and dark areas really shine  --> No blooming between nearby light and dark areas (LCD)  --> No image geometry warping related to brightness (CRT)  * Excellent motion clarity without artificial techniques like 120/240 Hz THX mode  * Accurate skintones  * Almost no picture setting tweaks required to get exceptionally good image quality Consistent black level  * Panasonic claims that the black level will not rise after 1000+ hours of operation with 2011 models, due to manufacturing changes. Power consumption vs. Screen brightness SIGNIFICANTLY improved over 2010 models  * In fact, it is so good that the 50\" GT30 actually qualifies for Energy Star 4.0 Viera Connect  * New in 2011, free/paid applications can be downloaded through the TV and the selection of applications will grow over time.-----Cons:----- Viera model lines segmented by size in the US  * Could mean buying a TV that is too large Average speaker quality on ST30/GT30  * US Viera models do not have analog audio out  --> Requires a dedicated power-hungry A/V receiver to improve on TV's speakers... Power consumption  * Improved in 2011, but still nowhere near local dimming LCD performance Fluctuating brightness  * Movie enthusiasts may find the delay in bright image processing frustrating...  --> I have found the issue has almost no negative impact on gaming performance, or general TV viewing. Netflix Performance  * Given the state of the Netflix app on Viera Connect as of June 2011, audio noticably stutters...  --> Mitigated by the fact that Viera Connect will allow users to download an updated version of the  Netflix app whenever the bug is fixed.Calibration-----------For those who are interested, I have had my GT30 professionally calibrated in THX mode.If you do not want to shell out $300+ to schedule a calibration on your set, but still want the best picture quality possible, the most important thing you can do is dial the color setting down to around 45. The default THX settings over saturate colors, and if you become used to the over saturated colors, you will never appreciate the advantages of a properly calibrated THX mode. Also, do not use C.A.T.S.! If you have a viewing environment that has varying levels of external light, you would be much better off maintaining two sets of picture settings. In my case, between night and day, all I need to do is adjust my contrast from 60 to 45. C.A.T.S. can detect differences in brightness, but it messes with more than just the white level.You may be tempted to set the Black Level setting in \"Advanced picture\" properties to dark because it looks more natural, but this causes black crushing (loss of detail in dark video). Try to learn to live with lighter blacks (this can be especially difficult if you are used to high-end CRTs) and you will begin to appreciate the amazing black performance of Plasma technology.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable Picture", "Author": "C. Wilson \"ceejw\"", "ReviewID": "RWKDUYK02GOCP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality this TV puts out is crazy good.  Colors are bright and vibrant without being over saturated and unrealistic. Blacks are inky black, and shadow detail is great as well.  One of the reasons I bought the GT30 over the ST30 is the THX mode which gives really good out of the box picture without any aftermarket calibration.  If you're into tweaking the picture though, there are two professional picture modes that allow very in depth picture controls.1080P Source Material with a high bitrate (such as blurays or Vudu HDX) look incredibly sharp and stunning, while not looking sharp to the point of unrealism as some LCD's look.  720P sources look very good as well if a bit softer.  480i/p sources look alright.  I only spent a few minutes watching SD and the experience was unexpectedly unimpressive.  Motion on the GT30 looks very smooth and realistic without displaying the terrible \"soap opera effect\" that 120/240Hz LCD's seem to suffer from.I tried using the Viera Cast software that Panasonic builds into these Tv's and I found to be pretty laggy.  It wasn't very responsive and I found the design to be a little on the ugly side.  Vizio and Samsung have much more polished media platforms built into their Tvs.  It's possible Panasonic will improve performance with firmware updates in the future.  If I was planning on using Viera Cast I would mark my score down but I have a Media Center PC and PS3 that replace all the functionality Viera Cast offers.3D performance is very good.  So far I've watched Tron Legacy on 3D bluray and played some 3D PS3 games; the 3D picture is very immersive and THX color accuracy remains very good in 3D mode.  I've had bad experiences with 3D crosstalk on a friend's Samsung C7000 LCD and it can get very annoying and distracting.  Thankfully I haven't experienced any of that on the GT30 in a dark or light viewing environments.I've heard some early reports of the GT30 exhibiting floating blacks when viewing material that changes from a darker to a lighter scene suddenly.  I haven't experienced any of this.  I watched Black Swan on bluray to test this and black levels remained dark and consistent throughout with no slight jumps in brightness.I'm also very impressed with the design of the GT30.  It's about as thin as my Motorola Droid and it looks stunning mounted on my wall.  Panasonic has traditionally lagged behind the likes of Sony and Samsung when it comes to the design of their Tv's but they really stepped up their game with the GT30.  Having a TV that looks almost as stunning when turned off as it does when turned on is an unexpected plus.Overall the GT30 is an incredible TV that makes no compromises when it comes to picture quality.  If you want to spend more money, the VT30 it will probably improve upon the GT30 in some way when it's released but I'm having a hard time coming up with things they could improve outside of their Viera Cast platform.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fluctuating brightness no longer a problem; great for games", "Author": "E. J. Paul \"EJ\"", "ReviewID": "RG76KJSX698B4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Admittedly, I was hesitant to purchase this TV because of the mixed reviews. Many people here (and on various forums and review sites) complained of distracting brightness fluctuations that significantly detracted from the viewing experience. I decided to just go with it and I must say I don't regret my purchase at all.First, yes, the brightness fluctuations were distracting. Notice the past-tense \"were\" there; as in, the fluctuations are no longer distracting because they are no longer a problem. For North America, Panasonic has acknowledged and addressed the fluctuations. For sets manufactured prior to August 2011 a repair is available in the form of an SD card software update or a very simple hardware replacement (pre-updated hardware for non-Panasonic repair techs as an alternative to updating the software with an SD card). So, don't let the looming shadow of brightness fluctuations deter you from this TV--if you get a set and it is a problem, call Panasonic and they'll fix it. On the other hand, you may not even notice them at all. So again, don't let it hold you back.I discovered this TV while looking for an affordable way to pick up a quality 3D HDTV, mostly for gaming.  3D performance is very good. Many have claimed this TV is crosstalk free (crosstalk is the phenomenon where the image intended for only one eye bleeds a bit into the wrong eye causing a double-image effect), but it simply is not; however, the crosstalk is generally not very noticeable in movies and games and in the case of games you can usually adjust the strength of the 3D effect to somewhat mitigate the crosstalk. For anyone wondering if plasma tech is ok for games the answer is yes, it is fine. Some people recommend about 100 hours of \"break in\" before leaving any static images on the screen. I don't know if this is technically necessary but there's nothing wrong with being cautious and conservative...100 hours really isn't much time for a TV at all. Some with a critical eye may occasionally notice image retention, but it is temporary. Just be mindful about leaving static images on the screen for long periods of time (for example, don't leave a game paused for several hours...just turn off your TV if you won't be using it, you'll save electricity). Many games have health bars, maps, or other fixed images on the screen, but in my experience these don't cause long-term problems: first, the TV will imperceptibly shift pixels around to keep them changing; second, most games have cutscenes, pauses, and transitions that change up the picture frequently enough that it won't really matter. Again, just be mindful and you shouldn't have any problems.This set replaced a Sony XBR LCD from 2008 and so far (2 months of ownership) I don't miss LCDs at all. Frankly, at this screen size LED backlit 3D capable LCDs are just too cost prohibitive in my opinion. Yes the power consumption is higher than an LED lit LCD so the long-term cost of ownership is higher in that respect, but I haven't noticed any difference in my electricity bill compared to my CCFL lit LCD; so, if you're coming from an older LCD the power consumption probably won't be a lot different.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture that's spoiled by fluctuating brightness", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R2VT1NALT6R84N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There is a lot to like about this TV.  It has nice aesthetics.  There are plenty of inputs and connectivity.  Unfortunately there are some things that are not so great and one that is a deal breaker for me.The over-all design and build is solid.  Some TVs have a weak and even flimsy feel to them, but not this Panasonic.The screen is very nice and coated in such a way that it is not too reflective.The colors are rich and blacks are impressive, too.There are plenty of display modes to switch between depending on your viewing habits and the content you are viewing.  These settings are remembered per input, so, for example, you can have different settings for the Blu-ray player on HDMI 1, and the Wii game console on component input.  The TV will change the settings to your preferences based on the input selected.The menus are fairly straight-forward and easy to navigate.  I like the fact that the menus are responsive and quick.  I hate the Sony menus that take a second or two to respond.The remote is not my favorite.  This is really a gripe about the design of two Panasonic product remotes and not specifically a gripe about the TV.  The remote for the Panasonic Blu-ray has very similar buttons.  I can use the Blu-ray remote for on/off volume and channel for the TV and I can use the TV remote to control playback of the Blu-ray.  The problem is that the buttons are in totally different locations which makes it confusing if you need to switch between them.  Why aren't the functions laid out similarly for a same-branded product?  Since the two products go together, you would think that the design of the remotes would echo each other in similar areas.  Oh well.It is a power hungry TV.  From what I understand, plasmas are power hungry due to the nature of their display technology.  They also give off noticeable heat. I believe manufacturers are being forced by regulations to build more energy efficient (Energy Star compliant) TVs.  It is also my understanding that this TV is more compliant than previous years' models.The big problem with this TV set and the deal breaker for me is automatic fluctuating brightness that CANNOT be controlled by ANY user settings.  During scenes that transition from light to dark or dark to light the brightness will make  distinct, noticeable, abrupt jumps.  It is distracting and even annoying in scenes that make these transitions from light and dark often.Most current flat panel TVs have dynamic picture settings.  The fluctuations are not from a dynamic display setting that has an on/off switch, nor is it a room lighting sensor.  It appears that this is the way these TVs are (poorly, in my opinion) designed.I watched the Blu-ray disc of Mike Judges's \"Extract\" with Jason Bateman, Mila Kunis, and Ben Affleck recently. In one scene, the point of view switches between Jason's character and Ben's character while they sit and talk at a table in a bar.  There were many of these fluctuations and it got quite annoying.It does not seem to matter which input is used: HDMI, component, or composite for the fluctuation to occur.  From my observation it does not matter which display mode is used either, including game mode.  I connected my trusty old PS2 and played some classic SOCOM Navy Seals.  There are many situations where the scenes changed from light to dark and vice versa.  There were lots of the brightness fluctuations.The sad part is that this is an otherwise great TV and I really do like the picture, but it is spoiled by the brightness fluctuations.I'm waiting to hear back from Panasonic after I called tech support and they walked me through a few settings changes that did not resolve the fluctuation issue.  They said they are researching it.  The TV's firmware can be updated.  I can't say whether or not this issue will be fixable through a firmware update.I will probably be returning this TV as I have had it for less than 30 days.  In my opinion, this fluctuation is unacceptable for a $2000+ TV.I've researched some online on this fluctuation issue.  Take a look at forums like AVforums.com, AVSforum.com, and HighDefJunkies.com.  Search with keywords like: Panasonic 2011, fluctuating brightness.  Decide for yourself.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV - be careful with image retention", "Author": "R. Harmer", "ReviewID": "REWEBR3GGI2VR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After extensive research on AVSForum, HiDefJunkies, and Flat Panel Reviews, I decided that I wanted the fantastic 2d picture quality, amazing black levels, and 3d without crosstalk for the future and this 55inch set was my choice since it was just a few hundred dollars more than the 50 inch.  It arrived today and I could tell the shipping company Amazon used treated the box/set very well (no marks, dents, holes) and by myself I assembled the base and put the TV on it (I suggest you use 2 people for safety).  I have a Pioneer Elite 36TX receiver and it doesn't have HDMI switching, so I thought that I was going to have to replace it.  My sources are DirecTv (HR-20), Boxee, and LG BluRay.  What I wasn't counting on, but LOVE (and it's saving me a lot of money) is that the Panasonic GT30 has an ARC (Audio Return Channel)via optical Toslink.  That lets me connect HDMI from all my sources to the TV and have the audio output to the reciever for surround processing - AWESOME!With only one day of watching, I think the picture quality is \"all that\".  I previously had a Sony Grand Wega III Rear projection LCD HDTV, and it's hardly comparable because the display technology has progressed so far.  Even major broadcasters like CBS/ABC/NBC in HD look suprisingly better.It also comes with Wifi in the box which you connect via one of the two or three USB ports on the TV.  That setup was painless.  I don't really intend on using those features (like Netflix), so I can't speak to that.  I *WILL* be using DLNA, and since both my Synology NAS and my Samsung phone support DLNA, I will see how well that works in the near future.Setup was very easy.  I'm a tech-guy and my wife could have done this.  Date/Time/What source is on each HDMI port and walla.What don't I like?  The HDMI ports are horizontal on the side of the set and your HDMI cables will protrude from the back of the set.[UPDATE 9-24-11]My wife mainly uses this TV and she watches maybe 50 percent 4:3 content.  I noticed a vertical line where the 4:3 content usually ends.  Our source is a DirecTv box and I had it set to use black bars and the standard picture (not stretched).  Well, I can tell you that screen burn-in/image retention is a reality with this TV.  I did call Panasonic and they were all defensive about image retention saying -- \"it's in the manual\" and it's not covered under warranty.  They did give me some tips to help, and maybe it will.  I changed the DirecTv box to stretch 4:3 content and use grey bars when needed.  I also used the pixel tool in the TV menu several times.  I'm hopeful that it will all equalize.  I only notice on a HD screen which is light/white.  I still like the TV and it's color, size, functionality, but maybe I don't love it as much as I initially did.[UPDATE 1/5/12]After about 6 months of stretched content, I believe the vertical bars are now gone.  I'm not sure if it was image retention, or just the fact that the 4:3 content part of the screen got more use and the extended part didn't.  I still have not tried 3D because the glasses are too expensive and I'd also have to pay either DirecTv for 3D content or buy a 3D BluRay and 3D BluRay movies... doesn't seem worth it at this point.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "The crown jewel", "Author": "B.

The money was serious for our family budget, so I wanted to make sure we were happy with the investment.  I ticked off, one by one, the competitors for \"in store\" demos, literally looking at dozens of models.....then I made the leap...and haven't had the first regret after two weeks of viewing.I have some pretty serious, state of the art LCD/LED TV's in my home already (Sony, Panasonic, et al), with their eye popping bright colors, razor sharp pictures, etc....but this is much more a movie theater type of viewing experience, with subtle shades and deep rich colors, fluid motion without pixelation....and the 3D is the best I have seen anywhere...every time we put in a blu ray movie or view the premium services (HBO and Showtime) my jaw literally drops....WOW...if you can muster the bucks, there is no way you won't be totally taken by this set.  I know the Samsung sets are quality too, but they can't quite measure up in my estimation.  The concerns about glare are certainly a consideration, but for the most part, even though my viewing area has several windows that can be shaded, they do not diminish greatly the watchability of the set....it seems brighter than most plasmas.If this jewel has any shortcoming at all, it would be in the sound quality of the set....so plan on at least a soundbar or an audio system, ideally.

I have another 2 year old Samsung 1080P LCD and I can see a clear picture improvement with this Panasonic GT30. I was a little worried about the fluctuating brightness problems that people have been seeing. I am happy to report that I do not see ANY fluctuating brightness issues in any of the modes (thx, game, custom, etc...)Out of the box the THX mode seemed to be the best, but I found some tunings that CNET posted for this TV and used those. CNET actually posted picture tunings for THX and Custom modes and mentioned that they believe their THX settings were better. My wife and I prefer like their Custom settings more than their THX settings. More realistic...- I can also make a couple of comments on 3D. I've ordered a 3D blue ray player with a few movies, but have not received them yet. I do have ESPN 3D though and was able to check it out. I purchased the x103 3d glasses and used those. The 3d effect greatly depends on the content that you are watching on TV when its broadcast. College football was OK, Extreme winter games were good and Boxing looked great with 3D. I did not see any cross talk and the HD clarity was very good. Just make sure that you don't have a lot of extra outside light in the room or the glasses will appear to flicker a little. In a medium to dim environment, there were 0 issues. I can't wait for the 3D blue ray player to see what movies will look like on this TV.Overall I am very happy with this TV.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wow is all I can say.

In this day and age most products are decent, but things can and will happen and you want to know the company you spend your money with will back them up.If you feel that way...You want read my experiences below and think long and hard if you want to send Panasonic or one of their resellers your hard earned money.  And if anyone from Panasonic reads this, the ball is in your court and I will post your continued response to this situation.So here we go.Order Flagship Consumer TV Panasonic VIERA TC-P65GT30 65-Inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV on Dec 5th...Delivered Dec 8th.  Turned on, plugged in my accessories, set up wireless network, etc.  Really nice TV and nice feature pack.  Watch a few quick programs, etc but  had promised my wife we would buy a Christmas tree that night and so after 3 hours ( + / - ) of use I turned it off and out we went to get a Christmas tree.  Came home, powered up TV and we have the \"7 blinking lights of death\"  You can google it, it has to be repaired. (if you want to get scared to death...Google \"10 blinking lights of death and Panasonic's response...but I digress).  So TV is down...No big deal, it happens and most electronics, if it will have iszues will be very early on and better now than later.I call Panasonic at 8PM EST (and Kudo's for having someone available that late at night) and talk to Customer Service Rep...She tells me the obvious, it needs parts and service and goes to send me to the premium conciere service Panasonic offers on its high line TV's to book the repair...and in doing so, disconnects me.  To her credit, calls right back and tells me that the Conciere Service is very busy and it would be a extended hold and to not inconvenience me promises me they will call me back ASAP and no worries, they do not close until 9PM so I am ASSURED I will get a call back.At 8:45 I am thinking it is getting tight for that call so I call back...They are closed.So I call back on Dec 9th (a friday so we lose time over the weekend), parts are ordered and the local service company (Pinnacle Service of RI) calls shortly thereafter to book service appt for following Wed.  I am kind of miffed Panasonic did not express ship the parts and knew the service group would have to fiit me in but...Its OK I guess.  Weekend passes and Monday Dec 12th I get a call from Pinnacle, appt has to be bumped from the Dec 14th to Dec 15th since parts delayed.  Again, not happy but I am trying to stay reasonable..Did I mention I used to work for Sony, Hitachi, etc...I am not a novice and I get how things are supposed to work, Fedex or UPS Blue or even 2nd day air cost less than a salesman's martini at a business lunch ...  and a recurring theme I will state over and over...It is a Mufti-Thousand Flagship Consumer product, not a budget blu-ray player and didn't I go with Panasonic as a High End and long term premium manufacturer with a long history of excellence.  I still think you express the parts but...OK.Pinnacle Service Rep comes on 15th, installs the parts, TV powers up and 70% of TV is black, a small percentage of both the left and bottom are viewable with numerous verical and horizontal lines and a large (size of my hand) irregular area in the 70% that has no color at all.  Looks like it has been hit with a paintball, a kind of irregular \"splotch\".  Tech rep shows me and as he touchs the area it shocks him and TV shuts down.  Needless to say, TV is dead.  He calls in and they are \"sending more parts\".  I am really not happy but I know he can only do what he is told and he leaves and I call Panasonic.  It is very obvious to me the set is hosed...and a new one should be sent.And now the fun begins.....Panasonic insists on sending parts and I am told that the only thing left will be the shell and the stand anyway, it will be a de-facto new TV... I suggest if that is the case, why not just SEND a new one...After all, this is not a toaster or blender, this is a multi thousand flagship product and shouldn't we be working toward making a customer happy instead of screwing around with more \"parts\"...But it is OK Sir...it will be a new TV other than the shell and stand and we will express the parts.Of course it is late on Thursday, but parts are ordered and so another weekend goes by...It is now the following Tues (Dec 20th) and still no word from anyone.  So again I call into Panasonic (keeping in mind I already have a minimum of 2 hours invested in phone calls..) and after 1 hour finally get the information that all the parts are in at Pinnacle but the replacement screen and that should be today or tomorrow they (Panasonic) would guess.  So I call Pinnacle to see when they are coming and they will not book the appt until they have the parts in hand (Didn't do that last time so that is a lie...) So I call back Panasonic to get some one to figure out where the screen is and oh yeah, that is shipping from SEATTLE (I live in Massachusetts).  They give me the tracking number and it is due to arrive at Pinnacle on Dec 22nd.  Now we all know a new TV could have been here in 2-3 days NJ to MA instead of the now 6 days.  So then I ask the Panasonic Rep the bonus question...\"If it arrives on the 22nd will they be here on the 23rd to fix my set\" since Pinnacle flatly refuses to book until they have the part...She puts me on hold, calls Pinnacle (I assume) and says \"Yes Indeed, as long as the part is delivered on the 22nd by 4pm the parts will be loaded on a vehicle and they will fix my TV in time for Christmas\".See this is important to me because this is the \"family present\", we are not doing extravagant gifts for each other or my teenage kids, this is it and a pretty extravagant gift it is.  And I have my football fanatic relatives coming to my house on Christmas Day to watch the game.  And did I mention the widescreen/Blu-Ray Star Wars Discs I got my son and the widescreen/Blu-Ray Taylor Swift widescreen DVD I bought my daughter that are useless in my old SD 4:3 TV ..... So I wake the morning of the 21st and WOO HOO, the panel is on a truck out of Boston to be delivered to Pinnacle in RI.  So I call Pinnacle and ask if the can tell me now when they will be here (hoping maybe we can shave a day off this) and I can't reach them.  There overnight phone block stays in place until 11 AM and keeps telling me I need to call between the hours of 9-5, which of course I am....  Finally I get through and I am told the screen has yet to be logged in but they will call with the appt as soon as it is.  OK, again, trying to be reasonable, after all it is the 21st now and the clock is ticking...I look on the trucking companies page and it is not updating so I live chat them and they do not have \"real time\" information (Great company you chose Panasonic..) and just data dump at the end of the day or beginning of next.  So again, since I have not heard from them I call Pinnacle at 2:45 and ...no, they do not have the Panel logged in but will check with receiving.  Then she comes back and says that \"receiving has left for the day cause .. after all most parts come in during the morning anyway\".  I am dumbfounded and then, just to be clear (and I know my voice was getting a bit stern...) I ask assuming it is \"logged in\" tomorrow (Dec 22nd and a Thurs) when they could come to repair since I have Christmas shopping to finish, etc.  And I am told the earliest would be Dec 29th at this time because after all it is a big job, needs two people, etc.  Didn't we know that earlier ???????  I was pretty sure, me as a novice, didn't think one guy was going to be able to totally rebuild a TV of this size???I had to [pick my kids up at school, so I could not get back to Panasonic until 3:45. Spent over 1 1/2 hours on phone mostly on hold again with Panasonic.  The Panasonic rep listen and then called Pinnacle since he could confirm that parts had arrived.  He was unable to raise anyone at Pinnacle to discuss why they could not confirm parts had arrived and/or why it would be until 12-29 until someone could come and repair unit.  I AGAIN suggested that it would be best to just send a NEW TV to me since this was their last chance to do so before Christmas and he was trying to get to someone who may be able to do that.  I did tell him that I would probably have to leave and he could reach me anytime on my cell or leave a message at home number.  I finally did have to leave at 5:15 on an appt with my wife and Yeah....Never heard back from him again.Called back at 7:15, Panasonic verified all parts had been delivered, never transfered me to a supervisor, lots of sympathy...etc.  Again, I pleaded for a new TV, AGAIN reminding him it was supposed to be a Flagship product, not a toaster oven and having a 877 number and \"Conciere Service\" means nothing if it doesn't solve the customers issue.,..and AGAIN...making it very clear I had a real issue with a Dec 25th deadline attached to it.  Nope, \"the parts will fix you up Sir\" ....So I call Panasonic on morning of 12-22-11 since even the lowly tech shipping company shows Pinnacle received on 12-21-11 at 1:47pm and signed for, Customer service rep sends me to Conciere, they call Pinnacle, they again will not acknowledge the part is in (It may be delivered but it is not \"in\" until it is logged into their system) and I am told ...Indeed, the best I can hope for is Dec 29th and they can not even promise that since, yeah, you got it, the part was not logged in yet and they do not book until them (again, a lie, they did the 1st time).  I ask for a supervisor who says \"Sorry, the 29th is the best they can do\",  \"Nothing we can do about it, they are a seperate company\" and my favorite, \"you know, other people have broken TV's too..\" This is the one and only time I showed any disrespect at all, I asked if she was kidding with that answer and when she tried to justify it I hung up on her.I then proceeded to Panasonics main website, hoping to find someone who could help me, clearly customer service was NOT the place.  I found the headquarters direct phone number and evetually found four names I could call  (another few hours research on Google). One was the US president who you will not be transferred to (I knew I would not get him, but can't even be transfered to his office...a Consumer Electtronics Company whose President's office DOESN\"T WANT TO TALK TO CONSUMERS....WHAT ????) another reached the office of a Marketing Manager (never returned my call), the Admin Assistant for the VP of Marketing for TV's (she finally called back after my 2nd call and suggested I call the office for internet sales and wished me good luck....WHAT ?????)  and a great guy in the press/promotional department that called me back and was pretty horrified as I went through my story.  he asked me to send the rough notes I have taken to him so he could forward to the head of \"Customer Relations\" so someone could help me.  Again, I pleaded for a new TV, AGAIN reminding him it was supposed to be a Flagship product, not an electric razor and having a 877 number and AGAIN \"Conciere Service means nothing if it doesn't solve the customers issue\"...and knowing this TV was hosed and having NO confidience it would be repairable.  1 hour later I got a call from Pinnacle, they would be at my house between 1:30-3:30.  1 hour later Appt changed to 11-1pm..I get an e-mail also confirming same time, 11AM - 1pm.So now Dec 23rd I am chained again to my house waiting for a repairs and of course Pinnacle is quite late and arrive at 3:15-3:30.  So I am stuck here all day and can't go out and do any last minute christmas shopping or anything waiting for the techs to arrive.  The Two techs show, they take the whole TV apart, new screen, new circuit boards and the Techs are a bit concerned because they only sent parts for a vertical issue and new screen, not for both vertical and horizontial (again, lied to....not ALL new parts)  after 1 1/2 hours of pretty gruelingwork for these poor guys guess what...Horizontal lines everywhere, totally unusable.  And what are the odds I can reach ANYONE worth a damn at Panasonic at 5PM on a Friday the day before Christmas eve.So here we sit, Christmas Eve with a boat anchor I need to pack up (yeah...thanx for that) and no usable new TV.  Christmas has been moved to my Nieces house (with their nice Samsung HD TV), I have Star Wars and Taylor Swift Blu-Ray DVD's that are coasters for now (kinda like getting that kewl toy for Christmas and your parents forget the batteries....) and by the looks of it I will not have a usable TV in December.  I have spent hours and hours and hours (Roughly in at least the teens) that I do not really have to spare and sure as hell should not have to spend to try to deliver to my family the Christmas present we all choose but Scrooge Panasonic cheaped out on a Multi Thousand FLAGSHIP product and are now the Grinch that stole my familys christmas.  Within our family and friends the whole thing has become a morbid joke. and what gets me is that I have told 1/2 dozen Panasonic representatives over and over again the TV was HOSED and the risk of trying to fix it was far in excess of just replacing it and would be faster and leave me as a far more satisfied customer just to send a NEW TV  As I stated in the beginning of this, I get that electronics fail, it is how the company handles it that matters.  And Panasonic didn't just \"screw the pooch\" on this one, they killed it and ate if for luch and then threw it up in my family room.  19 days and counting , probably at least and equal or greater number of hours on the phone and I still do not have a workable TV.So as I stated earlier Panasonic, ball is in your court.  I can GUARANTEE I will post a follow up to this next week and let the electronics consuming world know how you continue to handle this and respond.  How you look to me and this audience reading this next week is completely up to you but right now I have to believe people are reading this and thinking long and hard if they want to risk being treated like this for a important and very expensive consumer purchase.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fluctuating Brightness issue is a deal breaker", "Author": "Lance A. Davis \"lanced\"", "ReviewID": "R3OVIJ1TTRBJJZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the TC-P50GT30 model and the fluctuating brightness on my set (that many other reviewers have talked about) is extremely noticeable on my TV in the Standard video mode. It isn't just something that is barely perceptible. There is a definite and noticeable drop in brightness and then, ever so quickly, a switch back to the original levels. It was nearly unbearable to watch some programs and movies that have a lot of transitions from light to dark. I've found the only way to curb the brightness fluctuation is to set the TV into a different video mode. I currently have mine set in Vivid mode and the fluctuation isn't as noticeable but it is still there a bit. The quality of the picture is still amazing. The colors are spot-on and I would say it has one of the best pictures I've ever seen. However, with that being said, the fluctuating brightness was driving me nuts. The issue is much better combatted in Vivid mode but it isn't completely resolved. I would like to be able to enjoy the picture on my TV in the standard mode with the colors being the normal muted hues and not as blindingly bright as they are in vivid mode. I would also like to be able to adjust the picture to suit the type of movie or programming and not have to worry about this fluctuating brightness problem. Panasonic needs to release a firmware update to fix the problem ASAP or stop manufacturing the TV's with this glitch in them.The sound from the TV speakers is also not the greatest. The volume on the set has to be turned up quite high to hear any dialogue. However, doing so also results in very loud background sound levels when any soundtrack or music comes on.  My wife kept asking me why it was so loud but I had no answer for her. If I turned the volume down very much then we weren't able to hear the actors talking but whenever any soundtrack music came on it would get very loud.  I tried adjusting the settings in the TV menu but it didn't seem to make much of an impact, if any. The problem with the sound does not bother me greatly since I will be connecting a home theater system to watch most movies and other types of content that have volume fluctuations between the diaglogue & background volume. With my Denon receiver, I will be able to fine tune the audio so that this problem is not an issue.  However, if you don't plan on purchasing home theater equipment then beware of the volume jumps using the TV speakers. I would, at the least, recommend purchasing a sound bar to mount below or above the TV to take care of these issues.My main issue with this TV however was not the sound issues but the fluctuating brightness problem. After all, I bought the TV mainlty to watch the picture not listen to the sound from the TV speakers. The fluctuating brightness is a deal breaker for me. If I had bought this set from a brick-and-mortar store (like Best Buy) instead of Amazon then I would definitely be returning it. However, shipping on a 65 lb TV is cost prohibitive so I will just leave the set in Vivid mode, live with the problem and pray that Panasonic releases a firmware update to resolve the issue. I cannot personally recommend purchasing this TV based off my experience thus far. If there is an firmware update released to fix the problem then maybe I will reevaluate my stance but for now I am only rating the TV at 2 stars.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV but Sound System is not perfect", "Author": "Howard Hinman \"hhinman\"", "ReviewID": "REHX5XV1HP2W0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would have given this TV 5 stars because the picture and features are awesome. But the sound system is quite \"tinny\" sounding and I am going to have to find an external sound solution to truly enjoy the experience. I will probably purchase a sound bar and subwoofer. I was playing a well-known YouTube clip on it (you can access YouTube directly from the TV if you have it connected to the internet). The clip (Captain Jack Sparrow with Michael Bolton and the SNL guys) has a high pitched background track that almost completely drowns out the singing voices when played on this TV. Likewise, watching concerts produces poor sound quality. I tried adjusting the audio settings and no luck. I suspect it is a similar problem as notebook computers - trying to get quality speakers into something so thin.On the positive side, it was shipped and arrived in excellent condition from Amazon. There was some confusion about the delivery. We thought we had understood it included delivery and setup. The delivery guys were nice but only wanted to take it out of the box, lean it against a wall and plug it in and see the intro screen - and then leave. They refused to put it together or hook it up. I quickly got the stand out and figured that you just set it down and slide the TV down over it and put in 6 screws or so to secure it. So I talked them into at least lifting it up and putting it on the stand and I quickly put the screws in. Took a couple of minutes and it was together and ready for hookup which I had to do myself.The picture is incredible - regular TV, HD TV and 3D. I believe the 3D experience is deeper and better than at the movie theatre. However, the poor sound quality detracts from such. I got it connected to my wireless network quickly and without problem and brought up its link features. This is a bit of a mixed bag but still impressive. Here are my thoughts on Internet connectivity:1. It has Skype available but apparently does not work with typical USB Webcams. They want you to purchase their expensive web cam to use Skype - so we do not use this although we really wanted to.2. There is no internet browser. Instead they have some internet based applications installed - Netflix, Skype, YouTube, Facebook, weather, a sports application, etc. You can go to an application store and download additional applications - some for free and some cost. We could not access Facebook because we could not figure out how to get a \"@\" character from the remote control keyboard to enter the user id which is an email address (three pretty technical people were stumped by this - must be a way somehow but we have not found it).3. Using the remote control for a keyboard is akin to using a telephone number pad for data entry and not a pleasant experience (e.g. typing in things to search for in YouTube).4. There are a set of utilities including an option to scan the network for DLNA enabled devices to find Photos, Music and Videos to play. DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) is a new standard for exposing media to a network. It is supported by Windows PCs and I have a Synology Diskstation where we store content. I had to enable DLNA on the Synology and when I entered this utility on the TV, I could view photos video and listen to music files right across the network. Nice feature. My son was even able to stream a movie to the TV from his tiny Xoom tablet.5. There are 4 HDMI inputs and one has HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) to pipe audio back out to a device connected to such. We will probably use this for the new sound system I'm going to have to purchase for this TV. There is also a 15 pin VGA out type of connector for hooking up a PC. Given the issues described above, I am going to try hooking up a PC to the TV in order to use Skype and a regular webcam, have an internet browser with a real keyboard (I'll use a wireless keyboard and mouse), and access any other Windows based content on the TV as a monitor. I will try both the 15 pin VGA input and the HDMI input for such. I'll post more later when I try this out.6. We got a promo kit with 2 pair of 3D glasses and Avatar 3D movie for free with the TV (I think this promotion ended on June 28th however). The 3D glasses are expensive (I believe about $150 each for Panasonic Glasses). I ordered 2 additional pair of cheaper 3D glasses that seem to be highly rated from Amazon (\"Sainstore 3D Rechargeable Infrared Active Shutter Glasses for Panasonic 3D HDTVs\") which seem to work fine. It's good to have these other glasses because they come with different sized interchangeable nose pads and are less bulky than the Panasonic glasses. I wear regular glasses so I like the Panasonic glasses which fit well over my existing glasses. However, my wife does not wear glasses and she dislikes the Panasonic glasses which are huge on her and fall off her nose. Also, kids will benefit from the cheaper smaller glasses with changeable nose pads as well I suspect.7. A few days after receiving the TV we purchased a Panasonic DMP-BDT110 Blu-Ray player locally at Best Buy. We actually printed out the Amazon web price and took it in and got a sales guy to match it (which greatly upset a manager there who wanted to tack on overnight shipping charges but we talked out of). It came without an HDMI cable however and I had to go scrounge one up. This player has been great. You'll see some bad reviews talking about it lacking internet connectivity - which is correct. It's \"internet ready\" which means you have to purchase an additional wireless dongle to get it to work. It does have a hard wired Ethernet port on the back by the way. You really don't need the internet connectivity on the blue-ray player I believe, because it appears to have the same features as the TV does which is already connected to the internet. The only possible exception is that you might need to upgrade the firmware one time. I did this by running a long Ethernet cable to it, letting it connect and download the firmware directly from the internet and then disconnected the Ethernet cable and have not had any need to use it again. You can supposedly update the firmware also by downloading it to a PC and burning it onto a disk and inserting such into the player. This Blu-ray player is an excellent match for this TV and we are very pleased with it. It claims to have 2D to 3D conversion capability for non 3D movies which we have not tried yet. Ratings we saw ion the internet state the effect is marginal at best, but some claim it's nice.All in all, I'm happy with the purchase experience and the TV features and quality except for the sound which I'll correct. I suspect that most of these ultra-thin TV's have a reduced sound experience compared to the large bulky TV's they are replacing so I'm not too upset about the poor quality sound.Update: I just received a Panasonic SC-HTB520PPK soundbar Home Theatre system with wireless subwoofer and hooked it up to the TV set. Sounds fantastic! It's a bit pricey at around $350 but makes an incredible difference and solves the poor audio problem with this TV set. Very easy to unbox and setup - works with a single HDMI cable attached to this TV's HDMI/ARC jack. Using the Viera link function built into all 3 Panasonic devices (the TV, The DVD Player and the Sound Bar Home Theatre) either the TV Remote or the DVD Remote can control both the TV and DVD Player and volume.

I'm still waiting for the 3D glasses I ordered from Amazon, so this will be a 2D review only.  I'll update when I have a chance to spend more time with the television.I spent many hours visiting websites and local electronics stores looking at every TV 40\" and greater looking for a replacement (or a second TV if I selected the smaller screen) for my 4 year old Sony XBR4 52\" LCD 1080P 120Hz.  Although, I always felt my old TV performed magnificently it was starting to show it's age being 5 inches thick and weighing over 110 pounds.  Prices have dropped significantly and even 65 inch televisions can be found 1.5 inches thick or less.  Plus I have seen a lot of 3D movies in theaters the last few years and was really interested in a 3D ready television.I've been interested in Plasma TVs for many years and I have been impressed by what I read about black levels and picture quality.  However, like many I was concerned about burn-in and worried about the lower light output of Plasmas vs. LED/LCD TVs.  As for burn-in, I read a number of articles about how things have improved, break-in periods, and things you can do to minimize the impact.  After reading, I felt much more comfortable that my viewing habits were not the type that would lead to permanent screen damage.  As for light output, I realized that comparing televisions in electronics stores is misleading and that even the brightness of my \"old\" LCD at home was set at only 50%.After seeing the results on my new 60\" GT30, I can't believe I wasted all that time on the other LED and Plasma TVs on the market.  You don't need to pay a premium for the VT30 and the THX mode on the GT30 far exceeds the ST30.  I also looked at Samsung's D7000/D8000 Plasmas and LED TVs, LG Plasmas and LED TVs and LEDs from Sony, Sharp and Toshiba.I dismissed the LG, Sharp and Toshiba models pretty quickly.  I was impressed by the 2D quality of the Sony models but after reading online reviews of their 3D performance I had to dismiss those as well (I read that the 3D effect disappears when viewed off-center).  In the end, it came down to the Samsung Plasmas and LEDs and the GT30.  In the end I didn't buy thru Amazon (although it would have saved me sales tax).  I buy most of my electronics from Amazon but felt more comfortable purchasing such a large object from a local electronics store that could provide same day delivery and would pick it up if I wanted to return it within 30 days.DESIGNIn my opinion, the GT30 is the best looking Plasma on the market and maybe the best looking large screen TV period.I really liked the styling of the Sony XBR models with their one piece gorilla glass.  However, the bezel on the Panasonic is only about an eighth of an inch above the glass screen and the same color as the glass screen so from a few feet away it looks like a single piece of glass. Plus, you don't get all the reflections from a single piece of glass like the Sony. Also, the metal band (or simulated metal, I'm not sure) around the outside edge of the GT30 is much higher quality than the gray plastic \"metal\" on the Sony.In comparison with the Samsung Plasmas there is no comparison.  The Samsung models have a disco glitter dark gray bezel and a cheap acrylic looking edge (and I was really worried by the peeling issue).  Yes, the bezel is a touch thinner but the materials quality is no where near the Panasonic.  And yes, the Samsung is 1.5 inches all the way and the Panasonic is 1.5 inches with extra width at the bottom for speakers but I am using a stand instead of a wall mount, so this is not an issue.PERFORMANCENow, I will only focus on the GT30 as without a calibrated Samsung or Sony sitting in my living room next to my GT30, any comparison would be unfair (although a UK magazine did call the GT30 the \"Television of the Year\").For setup I used the THX mode as used by CNET for their review subject.  I used all of CNET's recommended settings except instead of Contrast set to +75 as recommended by CNET I set it to +50 (I read somewhere else that you should set Contrast at 50 or lower during break-in).  I will be doing a full break-in of 200 hours where I will not display static images or black bars on the sides or top/bottom when watching 4:3 TV shows or 2.35:1 movies.Last night, I watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, Horrible Bosses and Bad Teacher on Blu-Ray in 2D mode (remember, no glasses yet) using a Playstation 3.  For Harry Potter, I stretched the image to remove the black bars from the TV.  Results: AMAZING.I couldn't really evaluate color with Harry Potter as most of the color has been sucked out in cinematography.  However, it was a really good test of black levels and shadow detail.  Black Levels were outstanding -- true inky black.  Shadow Detail again was outstanding.  The details I could see in the veins in Valdemort's head, the Room of Requirement where objects are hidden and the gold and silver in Belatrix's vault were stunning.I used Horrible Bosses (also stretched to remove black bars) and Bad Teacher (which was a true 1.85:1) to evaluate color in a more realistic environment.  Again, the black levels and shadow detail were outstanding.  The colors exploded but were also very natural looking, and the Reds held up well.  Also, on Horrible Bosses there are many scenes panning over LA at night and driving on city streets.  Motion was handled amazingly well and never a sign of blur...again, outstanding.I then watched some regular TV shows past midnight and I have never seen my HD channels look so good (I never watch SD channels).For Horrible Bosses, Bad Teacher, and HD programming, brightness looked almost the same as my \"brighter\" Sony XBR4.All in all, the best picture I have ever seen.AUDIOSince the GT30 has a Digital Audio Out and my Bose Cinemate can only handle analog (I ordered a converter from Amazon last night), I got a chance to use the TV's speakers.I raised the Bass to +10 and reduced the Treble to -10 to enrich the sound.  I have to say for TV speakers, after adjustment they didn't sound that much different than the Bose.  Of course, I will be switching back to the Bose when my converter arrives.OVERALLI have owned the Sony XBR4 already mentioned, a Sony 60\" LCD Rear-Projection TV, and a 40\" Proton CRT (among others) and this is hands down the best TV I have ever owned.Run, don't walk to Amazon or your nearest store and order this baby as soon as possible.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible picture!", "Author": "Chris Jaronsky", "ReviewID": "R1Y667ICTAEGVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could not be more impressed with this TV.  The picture is incredible, the set-up was very easy, it has tons of features, it is by far the best TV I have ever owned.I mounted it to the wall using a VideoSecu Articulating TV mount which holds it securely to the wall.  I did not feel comfortable having this TV rest on the stand it comes with because I have 4 boys, and the living room sometimes transforms into a wrestling arena.  I would hate to have to put one or more of the boys up for adoption because they knocked over the TV.  So mounting it to a wall helps ensure they will have a place to live for a few more years...The TV comes with a wireless LAN adapter that plugs into one of the TV's USB ports.  That saves the hassle of running a network cable to that room.  So far I am very happy with the connectivity and have used it to watch instant movies from Netflix, shows from Amazon on-demand, and we also use it to check our weather reports.  The TV has many other features that are Internet based like Facebook, but we have not tried that because we do not have a wireless keyboard, and because we have a PC in the same room, so we will probably never use that feature.The only downside I have noticed so far is the sound quality.  We have the TV in a pretty large, open room.  When things are quiet the sound quality is great, but things get noisy around here sometimes and I am also a little hard of hearing (or so my wife says) so I need to crank up the volume on the loud side.  I may have to hook this up to a home theater system, which is probably a good idea anyway.  In a normal house the sound quality will probably be more than adequate.Once again I will get back to the picture quality.  It is very impressive, especially in HD.  I have satellite TV and had to upgrade the receiver to an HD receiver.  Watching the shows in HD is incredible.  I cannot speak highly enough about the excellent picture quality.  I am very happy with this purchase.I did quite a bit of research on TVs before buying this one.  This TV was very highly rated and I am happy and convinced that I made the right choice.**While this is a 3D TV, I have not purchased 3D glasses so I cannot review that feature.  Since 3D gives me a headache, I will probably never get a set of 3D glasses.  Actually I should clarify the previous sentence, 3D on TV gives me a headache.

Even a well respected podcast proclaimed plasma issues have been virtually eliminated.  The consensus is that plasma is better for gaming than LCD.  Well, plasma may have better response times and less lag in general, but burn-in is still an issue, and it's not covered under the warranty.I broke my TV in for well over 100 hours with those popular slides, watched movies for over 100 hours, and regularly checked the screen for image retention.  I played several games too (multiple God of War titles, among others) with no issues.  Everything was fine until I purchased Dark Souls on ps3 (which has an option to hide the Heads Up Display, but I didn't notice until it was too late).  After playing about 30 hours off and on, I now have noticeable burn-in on three corners of my screen (the bright HUD from the Dark Souls game).  It's almost impossible to see when watching movies unless the screen displays a uniform, bright image.  I had pixel orbiter running, and the auto shut off every three hours enabled (plus the no signal shutoff after 10 minutes option).  I spent a lot of time babysitting this TV!One hopeful solution to remove or reduce the image retention was the Pixel Flipper utility on the Disney WoW blu-ray discs.  I bought the discs and ran Pixel Fipper for several 20+ hour sessions to no avail.  I also ran a bright white image in the media player for dozens of hours for several days.  It's been a few weeks and the Dark Souls HUD images are still there.The vast MINORITY of plasma posts and reviews discuss problems, so it's difficult to notice and weigh them heavily when doing your initial research.  The overwhelming number of reviews are glowing--even for gaming related concerns.  I'm giving this particular TV a bad rating for something that's a general issue for plasmas, but the manufacturer doesn't do nearly enough (in my opinion) to make consumers aware.  So while some might consider this review unfair for a TV that displays beautiful images, I actually bought this expensive TV for gaming too.  I am furious, and I feel duped.

The picture quality seemed stunning at first.  The blacks seemed deep and rich.  HOWEVER, there was a terrible flaw in this TV that caused me to return it after about 20 days of use when I just couldn't take it anymore.People are calling it \"floating blacks\" or \"fluctuating gamma\".  For those who do not know what this means, it means that the image will suddenly change brightness on you, as if someone is pushing a brightness/contract plus or minus button, and it is very distracting.  You can find video samples of this problem if you search youtube for \"gt30 fluctuating brightness\", although the issue is not as noticeable until you are looking at 50 inches of screen in your own living room.  That's when it gets really obvious.Now, I'm relatively picky when it comes to picture quality, I admit, but when my fiance was also noticing the issue, I knew it was a real problem and not just my eyes playing tricks on me or something.It's a terrible thing to constantly be distracted from what you are watching because of a technical flaw with picture.  As a filmmaker myself, I work very hard to create images of optimum quality, that do not contain flaws that would distract a viewer from the content, and it's really sad that Panasonic is allowing this problem to exist on the open market, especially because they advertise that they put picture quality at the forefront of their priorities.It was also advertised via a couple of websites including Panasonic's website for this TV to have HULU plus, but it did not.In case you couldn't tell, I highly discourage the purchasing of this TV by anyone!", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "capatt", "ReviewID": "R1D1VYURNWXAVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this for only 24 hours, and I'm blown away by the picture on this fantastic TV.

Obviously because of the large size and fragile nature of the TV, I was concerned.  The driver called 15 minutes prior to delivery.  He helped get it into my home and unpacked to make sure the screen was not damage.Setup:  Assembling the TV requires putting it on the stand and tightening 4 screws.  For this 55\" version, it is clearly a two person task.  Everything is relatively obvious.  Some of the accessories are taped to the styrofoam, so you may need to dig a little bit to find everything.  The WI-FI dongle snaps into any of the USB ports.Choice:  I spent about a year mulling around a TV purchase and finally decided to pull the trigger.  I had a 10 year old Sony rear projection set that still had a very good picture, but I liked the idea of something that took up less space and had HDMI inputs for some additional accessories.  I chose this particular TV for several reasons.  1) The reviews at CNET and here on Amazon are quite good. There certainly are fewer negative complaints such as poor customer service or dead on arrival.  2) Great picture quality - it can be difficult to discern a good picture in a large box store, but this one was much better over other similarly priced TVs (plasmas, LCDs & LEDs).  The color on the GT30 seemed more realistic than other brands, in particular the Samsung plasmas.  I presume this relates to the settings from when it's pulled out of the box.  3) I wanted low maintenance - and most reviews, such as CNET, say the THX setting was already optimal and further calibration did not improve the quality.  4) Price - I wanted to stay under $2000 for my purchase.  The VT30 also didn't seem to offer much more for the extra money.  5) 55\" is just right for my room size (seating is 8-10 feet from TV).My Picture:  I'm very happy with the picture on my TV.  I do find a need to use two different color settings, 1) THX for a dark room and 2) CUSTOM for a bright room.  I haven't noticed the any of the artifacts others have mentioned in their reviews, such as changing grays/blacks/brightness.  Then again, I haven't gone looking for them.  Likewise, I haven't gone looking for any dead pixels.  I'm happy now, so there's no reason to try and be disappointed.  There were a few instances with the screen just going black randomly, but after a firmware update - no more.  I also purchased a smaller 42\" ST30 for my bedroom and the picture is comparable.  I may have been just as happy with the 55\" ST30.3D: In my opinion, 3D is worthless.  It's a cute gimmick, but I find no enjoyment in watching the picture on the TV.  In theaters - in particular IMAX - the experience is different, since you may sit much closer to the screen.  For me, the 3D effect just doesn't translate into a more realistic experience.  If I had to do it over, I would still purchase this TV, but would skip the 3D glasses.  The 2D-to-3D conversion is quite good for what it is, but once again, I would not waste my time.Menus: The menus on this model are very easy to navigate - much easier than past models or other brands.Internet:  I don't use the internet widgets much, but they seem very straightforward.  I did use NETFLIX without any issues.  Picture quality for streaming was excellent.Sound:  I don't use the speakers, but when I tried them out they seemed more than adequate.  No audio problems to report.Other: The 55\" model does not have the swivel stand - this was a bummer.  The remote is fine, but I prefer an alternate universal remote.  I also like that when the power of my Panasonic DVD player is turned on, it automatically changes the INPUT to the DVD.Summary: Very happy with the TV, would certainly purchase again.

So throw the LED thiness advantage out the window because the Panasonic GT series is super thin!  Also, the refresh rate is incredibly smooth, I have literally seen zero motion blur on blu rays or watching the NBA finals.

The HDMI input is horizontal and to the side, but for wall mounting that works fine, it's not a real drawback and if it is, you can buy a converter to have the HDMI inputs face the other way.I also attached an ethernet cable from my router to the back of the tv, and I can go online, and watch youtube.  And the Youtube videos look and sound terrific on here, it's nice not having to goto the PC when I want to see a clip that someone tells me about.If you are looking for a picture with better colors and contrast than any LED or LCD, and a faster refresh rate, then get this set.  Don't worry about pixel burnout, that is a thing of the past, and it only happens at airports when the plasmas have the same flight info on the screen 24/7, this TV has a screensaver and safety/temperature features... My last comment is that I own 2 Toshiba LED's, a Sony Bravia, and 4 other LCD TV's, and none of them compare to the Panasonic GT-30, there's a reason why so many film \"purists\" prefer high-end Plasmas, they're simply better...**UPDATE** I tested the 3D mode using Panasonic's own Glasses.

It's almost like the video board or processor in the TV cannot keep up with the changes. (similiar to lag on LCD)The result is alot of pixelation and virtually an unviewable, and a very displeasent screen.Just to be sure, I played those same scenes on my 4yd old 60hz samsung LCD, and there was zero disruption between scene changes in the same dark/bright conditions.Apparently,Panasonic claims these flucuations as normal as reported by other owners of vieras of the same model/line.I understand their is no TV that is \"perfect\".......and if you can live with the brightness fluctuations.....then this TV is awesome......but I couldn't do it.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "A beautiful TV fit for any home", "Author": "M. Stifler", "ReviewID": "R2WFTNOOMJ9KGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this television for about two weeks now, and I feel I have had adequate time to become acclimated with it. Let me start off by saying that I am a happy owner of a 42\" Vizio LCD. The picture quality is pretty good for the price I paid, and the size was big enough for the space I used it in. Until recently, I had no problems with it, but a few months back I had to send it in to repair the inverter board. This left me without a television for a month. During this time I began looking for a new television. The most important feature to me was picture quality. From what I had seen in person and what I have been told, plasma televisions have the best picture quality available. I also wanted to get a 3D television, as I enjoy it when it's done right in theaters. Those two aspects, picture quality in both 2D and 3D led me to Panasonic. I feel I made the right choice in choosing the 50\" GT30.I'll start out reviewing the look of the TV. Most people are under the impression that only LED-LCD's have a slim panel and are lightweight. Right as I opened the box I saw that this simply wasn't true. This TV is almost half as thin as my Vizio and weighs only slightly more; a given considering the size difference. The trim and packaging are both beautiful. The glossy finish is similar to many top TV's from other brands and is reminiscent of the IPhone4. On the rear, there is a plethora of inputs including a couple USB, four HDMI, as well as others that come standard on most TV's. The layout is very well done in my opinion. Included in the box are cables that join to the rear connections, allowing easier access if needed. This set also includes a swivel stand, which while nice, is something I will probably not need too much. I can, however, see it being useful to allow smoother access to some of the cables. Overall, this is one of the best looking plasmas available without paying absolute top dollar.The main reason I chose this TV over any other was because of its superb picture quality. The reviews I had seen weren't lying when they said this panel is top of the line. Black levels are deep, much more so than any LCD I have seen. The colors are bright and accurate. I've played video games, watched standard definition cable programs, streamed netflix movies, and viewed blu-rays over the past couple of weeks. Details are fine and crisper than I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. The contrast on movies such as The Dark Knight and The Matrix were a completely different experience compared to my old television set. Games had very good response time and appeared smother because of the better frames per second available compared to my Vizio.Another aspect of this TV that led me to its purchase was the 3D option. Many people are turned off by 3D. I believe this to be caused by two things. Number one: the lack of quality 3D movies. Number two: the excess of movies with poorly executed 3D. So far, I have viewed Avatar and Tron: Legacy in 3D. I have experienced very limited cross-talk and image ghosting. The loss in resolution, if there is any present, is miniscule with this television. I, personally, cannot tell the difference. The depth of field while watching these movies is just as good, if not better than when I viewed them in the theater. I have not had the chance to view any animated films in 3D, but I will post updates when I get the chance. The settings I used while watching the TV was the pre-loaded THX mode. From what I can see, THX mode is the best option, even better than any calibration settings I was able to test out.Now I would like to review my transaction with Amazon. There are a few reasons why I decided to purchase from Amazon. Most importantly, I use this site for many different things. Their customer service is second to none, and from past experiences, I am much more comfortable buying here than any other online retailer. Another deciding factor in my purchase was the financing options available. I used the 24-month no interest financing offer available by applying for the Amazon store card. I got an approval in a matter of seconds, and purchased the TV right away. So far, I have had no issues with the card. I was also very impressed with the two-week money back guarantee from Amazon. Because of a price drop, I contacted Amazon and received $100 back (credited to the store card of course). The white-glove delivery was done very professionally. The delivery guy brought the set into my home and allowed me to test it out a little and make sure everything was okay before I signed for it. 5-star delivery.Overall, I am very pleased with not only the television, but also with Amazon. Purchasing a new television is not a decision that should be taken lightly. It is an investment that will be with you for years to come. Judging by the level of quality in this TV, I am more than confident that I will be enjoying this investment for many years. The Panasonic GT30 is deserving of all the praise it has received. It is capable of more than just television, movies, and video games. It is capable of being a part of what each of us think of as \"home.\"", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm colorblind, but even I see the color inaccuracy...", "Author": "J. Fuller \"U2Joshua\"", "ReviewID": "R37FFWTVEGPIYU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I took a risk in purchasing this set despite a number of other reviews giving common complaints of fluctuating brightness, black levels and colors.  I am a fan of Panasonic plasma, and have a 2005 480p Plasma that still gives as good of a picture today as it did then.  As such, I assumed that buying a new, 2011 model would prove to be a superior experience.  It was not.I read that others had issues with fluctuating brightness, black levels and color.  I was excited when at first glance I also saw this fluctuating brightness, and then discovered the onboard VARS setting which is an automatic dimming/brightening function depending on room lighting.  After turning that feature off I thought I'd discovered the problem everyone else was referring to.  That said, despite greatly reducing the brightness fluctuation, this did not fix the brightness/black level inconsistency.  Additionally,the colors are simply inaccurate.  CNET identified this as a problem during their reviews...  And while CNET still considers this one of the Top 5 HDTV's of 2011, color inaccuracy is simply a deal-breaker for me.  When I am watching images of a person whose skin tones vary from accurate, to red, to green within the same scene, this is simply unacceptable.  Assuming firmware may have been an issue, I did have the set connected to the internet, and I installed/updated to the latest version of firmware - Version 2.06.All this said, I'm returning the product, and I'm going to take a shot at the VT30, the more expensive, top-of-the-line model, which while not getting perfect reviews, and it still having some issues with color handling, CNET and many others still say that despite it's liabilities is the best picture quality of any 2011 TV.

(except one fixable issue that, if spotted will drive you nuts)", "Author": "logan_c", "ReviewID": "R34N4GBS101HJK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE: 10/5/2011 (Fixed, happy!)My original review, below, focused primarily on my frustration with an annoyance that EVERY SINGLE 2011 Viera 3D Panasonic plasma exhibited.  Since mid August 2011 Panasonic has built the \"fix\" into all models that exhibited this problem.  Those who are bothered by this issue with sets built prior to a mid August build can contact Panasonic to get an update.Now that my set is fixed I can now revise my rating.  And I am very pleased to raise it to a 4 star rating.  This plasma is outstanding!  Great design, albeit slightly not quite as enticing as some other brands, and the picture quality is very good.  The only thing that still bugs me some, is that the color reproduction could be improved slightly.  However no one who has seen the set in person even notices what I am seeing...so good chances are that you will not either.  There is a fix that is rumored to be released soon to correct the color reproduction.Now that the FBr (read below) has been addressed and taken care of, I just love watching this TV.  The price is quite good and the difference between this set and one several hundred dollars is considerable.  You really need to head to a B&M; to see the difference in person, then do your savvy shopping.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I am not the kind of shopper that buys a new TV every year or two.  My \"old\" TV is a Sony Super Fine Pitch HD CRT that I have had since 2003 (picture is still incredible!).  I research a lot before any purchase (can be good and bad!).  I do not often buy the so-called Flagship models, but generally one beneath those model.  My logic is that I am hoping much of the flagship technology is in that \"one beneath\" model, with much of the high end techy picky stuff left out.  Works for me.  This model, the G series fit that bill.  Maybe you are that kind of consumer as well.  After months of research I ended up getting this model despite one issue I was aware of.My research lead me to a few popular \"techy\" website forums.  There I learned of the fluky issues with every single brand and model out there...including the lofty Kuro series that Pioneer built, and has since discontinued.  These Kuro's are pricey, but considered \"reference\" for us lowly consumers.  There are better sets out there, but then we are talking tens of thousands.  Anyhow, I was hoping that since it has been a few months since this G series models fluke came to light that Panasonic addressed the \"feature\"...to lessen it.  This is my bone to pick.It is really minor, but once spotted it will plague you for the life of the set.SPOILER:  Please do not read on if you own any Viera set (problem is designed in all of them) and have not had any problems...seriously, move on to another review, you will hate me if you own a Viera and currently enjoy it.  For those researching here it is...The Fluke:So here's the \"fluke\" of this model.  The techies on the forums call it \"Fluctuating Brightness\".  Last year the 2010 Panasonic had \"Floating Blacks\", which has been fixed for 2011.  The popular acronyms for the 2011 and 2010 flukes are FBr and FB, respectively, and there is a lot of information on these at forum sites, such as avsforum.com highdefjunkies.com.  If you search you will find it easily enough.So you know every single 2011 Viera model has it, and the \"fluke\" was actually intentionally designed by Panasonic as a beneficial \"feature\".  This feature causes the lower gray levels to change brightness.  Some feel that it is a power saving feature.  Panasonic has no public reference to this feature, so the forum folks have been left to taking guesses.  Some of these forum members are highly respected professional calibrators or Panasonic insiders.  Unfortunately Panasonic engineers made that \"change\" from grey levels (usually the lower greys) happen much too abruptly.  It's more like a \"pop\" when it changes, and it happens about 1/2 sec. to a 1 second after a change in a scene.  Now it does not happen all the time (Vivid Mode the least), but enough that it can drive you nuts once spotted.  One of the forum sites has a link to a spreadsheet that lists many movies and where in the movies it can be seen.  The \"FBr\" varies from set to set, so it is seen more or less based on an individuals set, and as an individuals perception to the \"feature\".  Professional calibration (at a  couple hundred dollars) can reduce, but not eliminate this \"feature.\"  Once you see this it will drive you nuts!  It has me, and I am not a videophile.  I have brought my complaint to Panasonic.  If you are sensitive to these things please be advised.Now don't get me wrong.  The set is outstanding!  The picture is one of the best I've seen.  In my opinion this is one of the best sets of 2011.  The accuracy of the colors displayed, the features, the design.  All great!  I am dinging the picture rating ONLY because of the fluctuating brightness \"feature\", otherwise it would be 5 stars.  Now if only Panasonic could send out an updated piece of firmware to minimize this abrupt change in grey levels I will be one super happy camper!UPDATE:Panasonic has contacted me and states that the picture dimming is within specifications.  UNBELIEVABLE!Because of the lack of a proactive response I have now decreased my rating to a single star.  If Panasonic can correct this problem I will re-evaluate my rating.  This would be a 5 star review if this Fluctuating Brightness problem is addressed...seems that a firmware correction, such as a firmware released to the European markets which corrects this, would all that it would take.  The fix seems obvious and has been done in another Panasonic global division...is it that hard to email some code?", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT - TIP FOR USE WITH HOME THEATER SOUND SYSTEM", "Author": "Bohemian Bon Vivant \"Bohemian Bon Vivant\"", "ReviewID": "RRY3HSSUKQSLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it December of 2011 and by then the \"fluctuating brightness\" issue mentioned so often here had indeed been remedied by Panasonic.A little tip from me to you if using with a home theater sound system and speakers (I use it with an Onkyo TX-SR308 purchased in 2011):Connect the HDMI cable for the TV into HDMI 1 on the TV (it's the only one that uses Audio Return Channel [\"ARC\"]), and then connect the other end into the appropriate HDMI port on the receiver.Then connect all the OTHER HDMI cables NOT into the receiver (as you may have done in the past), but into the HDMI ports behind the TV instead (the sound will run back to your receiver through the ARC feature in the first cable whether for broadcast, DVD player, Apple TV, Roku, or whatever, so only the HDMI cable  from the TV itself needs to plug into the receiver, not the other HDMI cables (they go into the TV).This is the only way I could get all the things to turn off AND on using the TV's remote (there are lots of people having this issue, I learned on the Net, of being able to turn everything on with the TV remote but not off [or vice versa, I can't remember for sure now]).  This fixes that issue.Also make sure you set the sound to HOME THEATER rather than to the TV speakers.TO CHANGE SOUND FROM TV SPEAKERS TO HOME THEATER:1.  On the TV remote press the MENU button.2.  Scroll to VIERA LINK and press the OK button.3.  Scroll down to SPEAKER OUTPUT and select HOME THEATER.4.  Scroll down and click BACK TO TV.If no sound check your MUTE buttons on both your TV and your receiver remotes, then play with the volume.  If neither of those fix it, putter around some with the menus, but this is what did it on mine.All this stuff should be fairly easy to figure out if you explore the setup menus and change things one by one, but I had assumed the HDMI cables would all go through the home receiver, and that doesn't work.  Instead everything should be plugged between the TV and the particular component, and the TV should be the only HDMI cable connected directly between the TV and the receiver (and then only on HDMI 1 on the TV side of things since it's the only one with the Audio Return Channel or ARC).", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV for the basic man", "Author": "V.

The majority of the posts include specs and technical functionality that means nothing to me or my wife at the end of the day unless I spend another two weeks learning.  And for what?  I want a bad ass TV period.Panasonic Plasma HDTVs are excellent TVs.  They definitely have different brightness levels, colors, etc compared to LCDs, LEDs, yada yada yada. The three levels of Panasonic Plasmas vary and the basic just is you pay for what you get.Here are the things I would advise you to look for (all of these are included in the GT model):Screen size1080p (if you are going to spend the money on anything bigger than 42 in, otherwise 720p is fine)THX Certified (this is the biggest feature...makes ALL the difference)HDMI inputs (especially if you have game consoles, a blu-ray, cable set top box: that makes 3 already, want an extra?)These items are the most important for me and talking to others these seem to be the most important to them too.

If you have an older model, just call the Concierge service and they'll take care of you.)As for the set, I'm completely pleased.

You have three decisions to make:  Which Model, Where to buy, and When to Buy.  Here let me help you.We have both a ST30 and a GT30 in our home.  In our master bedroom there was a space built into the wall that would not allow anything larger than a 46\" and we could not get a GT30 in a size less than 50\" so we put a 46\" ST30 in the bedroom.  Later a 55\" GT30 went into  a small home theater room.  As such I feel I am in a good position to help you choose. Given that the 55\" GT30 is $200.00 more than the ST30 it is a no brainer.  Buy the GT30.  The GT is way better looking and is thinner.  The THX video calibration is another plus but alone is not worth the price difference.  Both sets have great picture.  I would not call the ST30 ugly but it styling is bland and dated.  If you do not care at all what the set looks like or are strapped for cash the ST30 is your set.  If you care even a little about looks get the GT30.Where to buy... Amazon.  I bought our GT30 at Amazon in February of 2012 for $1,399.00.  Almost two weeks later Best Buy Dropped their price on the same set to $1,299.00.  Amazon then followed suit.  One E-mail to Amazon and a few hours later they credited me the $100.00 difference.  Of course if I bought the thing at \"Best\" Buy I would have had to pay sales tax and either schlep (carry) the thing home (it would never fit in my car) or pay extra to have it delivered.  Amazon delivered the product in 4 business days ( I scheduled it delivery on-line for a time that worked for me.. I could have had it sooner) for free.  Price Guarantee, Free Delivery, Price Guarantee, Liberal Returns and Amazon Customer Service makes it worth paying more to buy on Amazon.. but on this set I did not have to.When to buy:  O.K. on this one I can't give you much advice.  The GT50 is the replacement to the GT30 and VT50 is the replacement to the VT30. Both of these will be out in a matter of 4 to 12 weeks.  Do you want the 2011 model at an insane closeout price or do you want to pay $500.00 to $800.00 more for a slightly thinner, slightly better looking, TV with slightly better picture.  Reviews and previews of 2012 TVs can be found on CNET.  To me $1,299.00 for a 55\" THX certified 3d Panasonic is too good a deal to pass up.

BluRay viewing is now a must have!", "Author": "Horace'sWorld", "ReviewID": "R25RKLPK6VZYVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I too have finally  made the Samsung vs Panasonic decision and selected the P55 inch GT30 model. I considered the VT and the higher end Samsung 8000 model but my old eyes (49 years of age) could not tell the difference. For the price increase it would have been foolish for me. I decided to also by the BDT210 BluRay player to keep it all panasonic in the Panasonic camp. I actually have 3 other flat screen TVs ranging 42, 46 and 47 from Pioneer, Samsung and Panasonic, respectively, so I do have years of experience with quality flat screen TVs. First off I was scared I'd be the unlucky person to receive the ghosting or shifting light effect. Despite buying the TV in mid December the manufacturing date was August 2011, which was the tail end of Panasonic providing a permanent fix for the known ghosting issues. To make matters worse I didn't really plug in and test the TV until a month later after I mounted the Omnimount Ultra Low Profile x-Large capacity mount (this mount is sweeeeet!) on the back-side of the house. Two months later I plugged it all in and crossed my fingers. For some reason all I did was look for fluctuating brightness but to no avail (thank goodness) I couldn't tell if anything was shifting out of place. Still not convinced I immediately connected my wireless internet and upgraded the firmware before playing a movie. My initial firmware was 2.02, but the upgrade went to 2.2. Afterwards I popped in my Avatar 3D BluRay disc and was totally blown away (THX mode). Despite the large 55 inch size the clarity was better than HD on my 42 inch pioneer. The amount of TV inputs to tinker with is imressive if not intimidating. The BDT210 BluRay player is awesome. The Viera Cast connects both devices through the same remote which is very convenient. No need for multiple remotes. Everything that the BluRay remote can do (which is alot), the TV remote can do. The remote light is also pretty cool (an eerie deep red color). I was worried that the TV was too big for my bay windows, since I probably have 2 inches on either side. After sitting down for 2 seconds I wished I had a 60 inch TV, particularly since its mounted in the backyard. Without a doubt - Always get the largest quality TV you can afford! I also upgraded the firmware of my BluRay player from 1.68 to 1.80, which allegedly resolved alot of playback features and access to content. I have a basic Neatgear wireless G network and the connection to all the content i.e., Netflix, Hulu, YouTube,  games etc. worked perfectly and fast. No problems downloading any type of content from the TV internet wireless dongle (USB). The download time for an HD movie is about 20-30 seconds. My connection is average at best 2-3 bars out of 5. Not sure why so many people are complaining about download speed. Perhaps they need to upgrade their firmware. I did not try to download content from the BluRay player yet. Its a 90% overlap of the Panasonic content anyway. However, unlike the Samsung the Panasonic remembers your password to places like Picasso which is great. I can take a picture with my cell phone and view it on my 55 inch when I get home without typing in long UN and PW data. There is not an actual web browser available to insert a [...] location, but I was aware of that going in - no big deal to me anyway. My comment regarding plasma vs LCD/LED. Plasma is a deeper, darker and richer color. The boys at CNET got it wrong. I have a 46 inch samsung and off angle viewing is washed out. The Panasonic is indeed heavier but my high end wall mount does all the lifting anyway.

We ordered this and scheduled a delivery time at checkout.  Amazon did honor their price match on the TV as the price dropped $200 after the ship date.  Watch your timing because they only match the price once within 14 days.  If we jumped when it dropped $50 we would have lost $150 extra price match.When it arrived, the TV picture quality was great; unfortunately ours was defective.  It had a large (3-4\") wide blue and green vertical bar down the entire front of the TV.  We returned it (scheduled a return pickup through Amazon and the carrier - you cannot send back the same day because you have to contact Amazon first).  Our refund was rather prompt.  The only downside with the TV is that with the glass screen it had quite a bit of glare.  I would give it 4.5 stars if you are using it in a room with windows and 5 stars without.  We returned to Best Buy and realized that nearly all TVs now have glass (vs. matte) screens - even LEDs/LCDs.We looked at TVs again and ended up going with a Sharp 60\" Plasma TV.  The glare seems to be a little bit better and we are very happy with the 3D on it.  Both TVs have similar features and both are very highly rated TVs.  I'm sure ours was just a fluke with possibly being bumped in shipment.You can certainly feel comfortable ordering large, expensive TVs through Amazon (be sure it's sold or fulfilled by Amazon).  You can feel confident with both the 14 day price match and their free 30 day return policy.  The TV does not have something \"wrong\" with it (like ours did) in order for you to return it for free.

Not perfect. For the same money, I haven't any idea what I'd rather gone for, everything has drawbacks. The set is good but it also has its share of problems.Here's the story. I upgraded from a 54G20 2010 Panasonic plasma for the following reasons: it buzzed alot! and was distracting and an issue known as \"floating blacks\" (never remedied by Panasonic and destroyed my viewing experience.)So I heard that floating blacks were fixed in 2011 and I wanted to try and see if I could get a plasma that didn't buzz so much.The floating blacks are gone. I am so very happy about this. However outside of THX mode they are replaced with floating brightness. However, since I use my 55GT30 exclusively in THX mode, this isn't that great of a concern for me.Thankfully its been fixed by Panasonic in 2011 either through firmware or A-board replacement. People seem to have had very good luck clearing it up and supposedly television built after August 2011 have it incorporated. Samsung users on the other hand seem to still be struggling.My 55GT30 still buzzes however not *nearly*? as bad. I can still hear it from my sitting position in certain situations. However it isn't as bad as 2010. In most instances I cannot hear it over content. Yet when displaying break in slides (pure grey screen) it buzzes something fierce which is scary. I'm still deciding whether I will keep the TV and accept the slight buzzing, or return it and try an LED. The thing with buzzing is that its so variable and hard to nail down. Some people are completely immune to it. Some people report that their plasma is completely buzz free.I have a relative who can't hear the buzzing. I don't know what to think. Panasonic doesn't have a definitive answer.My set also has some slight greenish tint discernible most easily on grey material. People call it the \"green blob\". From my extensive scouring of internet, I believe this problem affects most EDIT:ALL 2011 owners. Some people get worse blob. Some will never ever see it. Its there though. In all actuality however on my set its impossible to discern with the material I view. EDIT: Recently I've been playing a game with a greyish loading screen and I see the greenish tint/blob on a regular basis. It frustrates me greatly that a 1400$ set would have such a defect. Especially given the fact that one of the main! draws of plasma tech is the uniformity. I feel slighted. Reviewers did not mention this, but when do they. Panasonic has done little to nothing for other users I've read about. I have yet to contact Panasonic about this problem. I am subtracting another star. Frankly, I find this inexcusable.If you buy this TV, know, you will more than likely get some degree of green blob on grey material. Whether or not you are effected by it is determined by the type of material you watch. Black and White movies. Yes. Hockey. Yes. Winter Olympics or Planet Earth Antarctica. Double Yes.When I purchased, I thought green blob was isolated. It is no way, shape, or form isolated. It is widespread. I wish I would have known this.The amount of horizontal line bleed I experience with my set particularly with menus hasn't changed from 2010 to 2011. From my research this is a particular of plasma tech. Upon further movie watching there are a couple scenes which annoy with line bleed. Seeing line bleed on the green rating screen of all movies is annoying. I've also seen window blinds bleed through an actor's face standing next to them. Remember this is all in regards to \"THX\" mode, not some crazy settings I've dreamt up.The design of the TV is very slick and thin. The blacks are very black. I think the new grill design and slightly lowered black levels makes for a blacker black in 2011. However that could be a complete lie,as I don't think the human eye can even detect the change in black level from 2010.In the end, I have to pick what I'm willing to live with for a TV. I didn't go Samsung because they are suffering from the floating blacks this year and from my reading seem to have a greater tenancy to buzz. I suffered floating luminescence in 2010 Panasonic plasma and I will never buy another TV with that problem. Samsung seems to be doing absolutely nothing about it. I'd have to spend a couple hundred dollars more on an equivalently sized LED/LCD and take serious risk with the possibility of uniformity issues, due to bleed, flashlighting etc.Off angle viewing is excellent. Another plus for plasma. People still are afraid of burn-in and I have no idea why. Its a total non-issue these days.  There you have it. I will probably edit this review as my feelings change about this TV. Panasonic support I must admit is very helpful as I found out in 2010. However be afraid of any problem they could deem as in spec, as then you are doomed.The verdict is still completely out on whether plasma's buzz or not and how much. It will most likely never be answered.This is the first time I've ordered a freight item from Amazon.com. To say the least I was very impressed. The item arrive two days ahead of schedule. Pilot freight company offers responsive tracking. To the best of my knowledge my TV wasn't banged around all the way here and seemed to be transported in a respectable manner. The box had minor shipping damage but nothing serious. I would have bought this TV from Costco, but Costco at time of purchase didn't carry it. Next best thing is Amazon.EDIT: I ended up keeping the TV. I'm disappointed that such an expensive consumer electronic has defects like the green blob.

Panasonic makes the highest rated, best plasma displays on the market for the middle-end consumer and even higher-end sets. The GT30 has taken some hits due to its black-leveling during scene transitions.  This seems most notable to those who may not understand or have the know how to alter the video settings properly; I DID notice this occurring when video output is set to \"standard\", once you tune the display properly, there should be no noticeable or any flickering between darker scenes to brighter transitions.  To go into great detail on how to properly set your TV would be worthless, a \"good\" picture varies person by person but this preliminary issue should not deter one from purchasing this set.With that out of the way, consider this: you will not see a better high definition plasma display on the market.  At the GT30 price, you are not going to get 3D quality, HD quality, feature set and value any where else. If you have not been to any store to view other brands competing with this set/price, do so and do yourself a favor. Once you see a GT30 set up properly, showing the same content as other brands, there should be no questions left to answer. The display owns. From blu rays to PS3 to Wii to regular DVDs, I have not scene until this plasma a more OUTSTANDING visual display. Blu Rays appear as though people are standing in your living room.the most noticeable attribute of this plasma, at least to me, is the quality and richness of the depth in the display. Its simply amazing. Looks like you can reach your hand into the background and touch things. And no, I am not talking about when 3D is on, that is another story. In pure HD form without 3D, the depth, black, and richness of this display is simply jaw dropping. Your friends will not understand what they are looking at. To note, a HD gaming system looks simply unbelievable. You will be playing your games for the \"first time\" all over again.The bad: THE SPEAKERS ARE DOWN RIGHT AWFUL. if you do not have some sort of surround sound system, or at the very least two channels (front left/right) the speakers sound terrible, they may as well sold it without them and saved a few bucks. You will need some sort of sound bar or extra components to get anything other than dialog. And the dialog is barely satisfactory; no bass, tiny highs, bad spacing and underpowered.3D: Panasonic has the best 3D on the market. Compare it with Samsung or Sony. There is no comparison. View them back to back and you will find that Panasonics 3D technology, although requiring ACTIVE shutter glasses, reproduced 3D images in HD form where as others may not. Samsung for example, 3D reproduction looks like cardboard paper cutouts with no depth and lacking resolution. Not in the GT30 however. The 3D is amazing and even the 2D->3D reproduction (taking standard 2D video and artificially creating 3D images) adds incredible depth to your viewing experience, albeit not so much \"pop\" off the screen. Worthy to note is that 3D viewing does produce a somewhat dimmer display, not sure if this is due to the glasses tint or how their system works, but overall when 3D is on, expect a less vibrant picture from non-glasses viewing.Overall, theres not much out there for the GT30 price that offers screen size, content and value. Above all else, picture quality should take the cake here. Please check it out in a store and make your decision. Cant beat this set. On a side note, internet connectivity works flawlessly, I wired the TV with a ethernet cable, which, you should do if you expect the highest speeds and purest connection.  The TV synced up with zero glitches and loaded youtube, pandora and amazon with the ease of touching 1 button.Excellent buy, sound is its largest demerit but can be remedied for a couple of bucks.

There were several reasons I chose this TV.  I needed a huge TV, and the height of this was comparable to the height of my old 50 inch standard-def TV.  I also considered a Mitsubishi rear projection TV, but decided they were too unreliable, especially their lamps.  Finally, I did not want an LCD TV because I find they all have image quality issues.

I am sure the the cheaper 65-inch model (TC-P65ST30) would have been the same for my purposes.The image quality on this plasma TV is outstanding.  It is crystal clear and I barely ever notice any artifact.  Unfortunately, it was not so great out of the box because the default settings are very dim, so it took a bit of tweaking.  The sound quality, on the other hand, is absolutely pitiful and horrendous.  It sounds like cheap computer speakers.  I wish Panasonic had put in better speakers.  I tried increasing the bass and using the bass boost feature, but that does not help.  Another drawback is that it uses a LOT of power - 512 watts to be precise.

My other option was the Samsung D7000 LED.  I demoed the D7000 and was fairly impressed.  After all it was light years better than what I currently owned.  I ended up waiting for this TV to come out, especially since it was about $500 cheaper, however I never had a chance to see it in person.

This TV has the deepest blacks I have ever seen, and the shadow detail is spot on.  The 3d is the best I have seen at home or theatre, although I think it is riduculous that at TV of this caliber and price point ships without glasses.  Hopefully Panasonic takes a cue from Samsung and puts out some lower cost glasses.  I did get a chance to play Killzone 3 in 3d.

Back then, it was more about thin than anything else.  I still have that panel and it works fine, with the caveat that the black is more of a light gray.  Fast forward to 2011 and you have a 55\" panel that is 1080p for under $1400 with black levels that rival the reference pioneer panels.  I'm a bit of a TV junkie and have had LCD's, LED's and plasmas throughout my home.  This panel is stellar in terms of image quality.  I don't really care about the 3D BS; 2D image quality is what matters and at a viewing distance of 9 feet, this thing rocks.First, kudos to Amazon for their efficient logistics:  I ordered this thing on a Sunday night and it was hanging in my man-cave on Thursday morning.  Best Buy didn't even have a date that it could be delivered and Amazon had them beat on price by $300 and had it in my house in 4 days..... Seriously?  Now to Panasonic.....  It's amazing how anal we have become over image quality when 10 years ago we were squinting at our CRT televisions wondering if Dick Clark was wearing a blue tux or a black tux.  Today, we are looking to see if Ryan Seacrest has a piece of sushi stuck between his teeth.  All I can tell you is that for the money, this panel kicks ass.  I have a Samsung LCD, and Sony LED and a Samsung plasma and this thing puts them all to shame.  Scoop this up while you can at these prices before the 2012's hit the street.  There is no way that the 2012's will be that better than this crop.Small caveat on plasma's achilles heel: image retention and burn in.  This panel is replacing a Samsung D8000 from 2010.  The Sammy performed admirably with the exception of line bleeding (dark text on a light background) and atrocious image retention (not burn-in).  I HIGHLY recommend running the break in slides easily available online via a google search for the first 100 hours of use.  I've watched ESPN and other networks with ridiculous logos and have not had any issues with image retention at all.  Don't let the thought of image burn ruin your experience with this panel.

My Samsung LED 8500 was rated by CNET as having the best picture and blacks equal to or surpassing the Pioneer Kuro. I'm not exaggerating when I say the blacks are the same color of the TV frame. The Samsung full back lit LED has blacks that are simply unparalleled. So why do I rate this Panasonic so highly. Unlike my Samsung LCD and LED the TV does everything well. My setup places people at about 45 degree angle which made blacks appear slightly grayish on the LCD or LED. Also the LED suffers from something I call the Smokey effect, when objects moved too quickly its as if they leave a smoke trail behind them. I have not seen any problem with fast moving objects on the Panasonic plasma's and I have two of them. I have to mention that when I bought this Panny I got one built in April 2011 and it suffered from fluctuating brightness, which was resolved when I got the one built in November 2011. The stainless steel belt around the frame gives the TV an expensive look and matches perfectly with my TV stand. I'm not crazy about the apps so hooking it up to a PS3 was a joy because the TV remote controls the PS3, don't ask me why it just does. The 3D also works great and I was able to get Panny 3 gen glasses cheaply. If the Panny VT wasn't so expensive I would have gone there but Amazon's sub $900 price for a set of this quality made it a no brainer.

Originally, I was so excited to buy the Samsung right before Christmas and enjoy the \"state of the art\" in tv technology.  The Samsung is super thin, super light and has a bezel that is about .25\" wide, quite visually attractive.  Unfortunately that is the end of the good parts. There are many reviews of these tv's but suffice it to say the samsung is unwatch-able on certain programs.  Modern Family and The Office are two shows that highlight jitter and motion blur in even the simplest scenes.  It also had the ability to make movies look like they were filmed with a camcorder, color was way off, highlights were blown out.  After a lot of color corrections and various settings you can get a specific movie to look better but then the next program looks awful. To make matters worse this tv would randomly change from one input to another (after a google search come to find out other Samsung owners have this issue).

They are far superior to the LCD/LED garbage being hustled out there. I turned on the Plasma, set it to THX picture setting and everything looks great.  Superior black level, no motion or jitter effects.  I laugh at the energy consumption sales tactic as well, the Samsung had an estimate of $17 per year and the Plasma's estimate was $24.

A considerable amount of research went into purchasing this TV.  In the end, the price to quality ratio seemed to be best for this unit. The picture is amazing (especially compared to our 2009 Samsung LCD). It is so sharp that I can actually see differences in quality between Blu-Ray discs (CGI based movies and Avatar 3D, also heavy in CGI, receive the gold medal thus far).  The black levels are deep with stellar contrast. THX is the most accurate to life of the picture settings, in my opinion. The 3D is amazing with the quality primarily resting upon the media (some 3D movies/games are not that impressive, no fault of the plasma).  We received the Panasonic TY-EW3D2MMK2 Ultimate 3D Starter Kit (Avatar 3D + 2 Rechargeable Glasses) free with the unit. We have not noticed any issues with fluctuating brightness, as some individuals report, and I have been on the lookout.  We are actively working to prevent burn-in, since this has been reported to be a problem.  After a month, I'm still blown away by the picture quality.The ports are on the left side of the unit (when facing it), which works perfectly making access much easier.  There is plenty of room between the ports and edge of the TV to bend the cables out of sight behind the screen.  The remote is user friendly.  The unit comes with an external wireless adapter; it's unclear why this hasn't been internalized.  The speakers are not of a great quality, but do the job; we will likely invest in a quality sound system sooner or later.There are a few things I don't like about the unit:1. Watching TV in a bright room is challenging.  The screen is very reflective and the picture brightness can't really compensate.  Using it in Vivid mode helps, but it is generally necessary to close the blind for the window facing the TV. This was not such a problem for the LCD, as is to be expected.2. The wireless is VERY slow to link with the router.  It often takes 30 seconds to a minute, which is annoying.3. The Viera Cast online resource is clunky.

I talked with a friend who works installing TV's and he told me that he had seen it on 3 separate occasions. So needless to say I decided to go with Panasonic.I'm all about 24p for movies. So I was torn between this and the smaller 55\" (much more expensive) VT30 because of it's 96Hz mode. But after a lot of watching the two sets at the store I decided the difference was too small to justify the massive price difference. Besides I got a much bigger screen with the GT30.The image quality on the GT30 is beautiful. If you read too many forums you'll hear a lot of nerds ranting about how their light meter and expensive equipment measured something that wasn't good in one way or another. Bad gamma etc. But to the eye the image on this TV is beautiful. Better than any LED/LCD you'll find. There was also a lot of talk about a Fluctuating Brightness issue or \"FBr\". None of the two sets I looked at in the store had this problem, and I was looking for it. I've now watched probably 10 movies on my new set and I've NEVER seen it.

With the research I've conducted I found that the following are common experiences for those who bought this TV:* 1-2 years of good service from the TV (happy customers when the TV was working)* for the 55\" Plasmas Amazon customers spent around $1500-2000, for the 60\" Amazon customers seemed to have spent about $2000* the listing description advertise \"Long Panel Life, Up to 100,000 Hours\" leading customers to believe the TV will last for 10 years, along with some statements about how a long lasting TV will benefit the environment. Many customers though when faced with a dead TV are faced with a difficult decision on is it worth repairing on their own dime (which is paid to Panasonic ultimately for the board replacement BTW) or trashing the TV (not good for the environment). Panasonic is not standing by this statement of supporting the environment during their support,* A couple of reviewers mentioned that Panasonic was not willing to support them as they were just outside of their warranty.* Some common noises associated with the failure: a Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzing which Panny states as operating within normal tolerances when I mentioned it to them during the warranty period (in hindsight it looks like it is a precursor to failure according to comments online) then either a loud pop with a subsequent black screen or just TV just starts blinking red at you on the next start up. The pop is not associated with all failures - but it is a common complaint. Panasonic will not support you if you complained about the buzzing in the warranty period (but followed their advice) but your TV died outside it.* There is some talk about the screws fastening the boards to the frame of the TV are faulty, and there are updated screws you can buy. Panasonic is not commenting on the screws when I asked them about their existence.* Many people mention that there are boards you can buy to replace the faulty ones but they comes directly from Panasonic for the seven blinks of death. Some are reporting a shortage (probably because the high failure rate). Panasonic will not supply you the board for free - you will need to contact the parts department yourself if you are going to attempt to fix it - but remember: garbage in, garbage out.* The customer service department is well versed with these phone calls/chats for the failed Plasma TVs. The script is: unplug the TV then wait (some time) then try a different outlet? Then as pleasantly as they can deny any further assistance or direct you to the parts department. The department is based in the Caribbean (just a fun fact)*Panasonic will not produce any further Plasma TVs as reported by CNET on November 6, 2013. After touting Plasmas as the king of displays for the past couple of years, they will be switching, along the rest of the industry to LED, oLED, and other formats. This is probably not good for those of you who will be looking for parts later on.** Amazon continues to sell these models and the next generation models. The next generation is starting to see some negative reviews based on the TV failing to display (although most of the 1 star reviews are due to screen burn), but not to the extent we have seen with this older model. Panasonic has the upper hand since Amazon customers come one by one reporting their TVs have failed. It may help if other Amazon customers report directly to customer service their poor experience with the product and with Panasonic so they can \"pass on these comments to our concerned internal department about this issue\" and perhaps Amazon will stand by their customers and pressure Panasonic to respond favorably.Besides, watching your $1000+ investment sit there and blink red at you gets old pretty quickly...If you would like to log a compliant to the BBB - the Panasonic address to use is the following:Business Name:  Panasonic Corporation of North AmericaAddress:  2 Riverfront PlzNewark, NJ 07102", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dies after 29 months", "Author": "Ringo", "ReviewID": "R1MC6IVBPLJ1YM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This has been a great tv, but at 29 months it fails.

I went with the Sony HX820 and it simply had much too many issues for its cost (flash-lighting, huge crease, uneven whites, etc).  After much research on LED's and realized that most top of the line LED units have these issues.  Shelling out that kind of money for a product that has been proven to be vastly defective was foolish on my part but thankfully I did get the refund (not on Amazon).Now for the 55GT30.  I was hesitant at first to go with Plasma due to image retention and heating issues.  Again, I was wrong not to just buy this set from the get go.  After my first GT30 was delivered with a cracked screen, Amazon promptly sent a new one and was delivered less than 48 hours later.  I received a December 2011 build and have had no issue whatsoever.Pros:Absolutely Fantastic 2D Picture (have not viewed 3D yet).Colors look natural in THX mode.  Deep black without the over brightness on LED, which in my opinion, washes out much of the detail.Sports look amazing and much more crisp than the Sony LED.Blu Ray Movies provide a very rich black level and incredible detail (view in THX mode which is a great upgrade).Sound is fine but will upgrade to surround shortly.Ton's of Viera features but I primarily use the PS3/360 to view media.Very sturdy stand that is extremely easy to assemble (the LED stand was small and wobbly).Sleek bezel and overall very thin TV that takes up no space at all.Cons:None so far to be honest.  No fluctuating brightness, no image retention, and no \"green blob\" issues here.Overall:I am kicking myself for not purchasing this unit sooner.  I sit 8 feet from the TV and highly recommend the 55\" over the 50\" (you will thank me later).  If you are interested in a close to top of the line unit (couldn't justify the extra $500 for the VT30) that has fantastic black levels for movie viewing and can handle fast action sports, this is definitely the unit for you.I also had a ton of questions my self about \"breaking in\" the unit before viewing but I opted to just start viewing content out of the box in THX mode with all settings <50 for the first 100-150 hours or so then I will tweak from there.

First out, the picture is outstanding never had a better tv. Before this I owned a Samsung LN46A750 but unfortunately the screen broke and was forced to make a purchase. Bit the  bullet and decided on the Panasonic gt series as budget was more a concern. I would have taken the vt if I could have afforded it as I thought the picture quality was a little better in store where I saw it.  Definitely the vt looked a little better.Took the GT home and was immediately drawn to the great color  tones and contrast.  Blacks are really good improving the overall image. As with my televisions I always try to look up the specifications to get the most out of them.For viewing I move back and forth between Custom, Cinema and THX. The latter is more frequently used than not. I love this picture setting more than any because of color and picture fullness, the draw back is motion judder as the default doesn't allow you to change the setting.. Custom setting I have set to strong motion smoothness. On other websites the experts say that Motion Smoothness should be turned off but I enjoy this feature because I can't stand motion judder and with this TV it sometimes can be unbearable and highly distracting. Some movies it's not as bad but with some others the picture is really blurred when the camera is panning. How has no one reported this, I don't know. I googled this to my  wits end and have not seen anyone report this problem; is it just me? Panasonic gave you two options 48hz and 60hz. 48 hz is just a waste of time as that setting is just impossible to look at. There was more jumping and judder than anything Ive seen in a television.Put on 60hz and things are a Lot better. I've seen other reviews where it's said the VT has a 96hz setting which makes things much better. After about 2days of viewing this tv I had it packed and back in the box to go as I saw it on amazon for same price I paid in store. It the hassle of having to do it all over again made change my mind.This Plasma tv definitely has better overall picture  than the first Panasonic Plasma I got about 4yrs back as the contrast ratio and brightness have greatly been improved.

I have been a avid Sony owner until they refused to fix a factory defect in my $5000 TV, I am so pleased, my allegiance has change, The only negitive is that this TV is 3D and I can't believe you can pay this much for a TV and they don't give you 3D glasses with the TV. I have not seen it in 3D because the glasses are about $200 a pair.

I would have purchased this off of amazon but they would not price match. I paid $900 shipped off ebay for a new open box unit that has a build date of July 2011. I have had no regrets thus far. The delivery team was a company called HomeDirectUSA which provided an excellent service. I purchased the tv on December 7th and it was delivered on December 14th, at 6am in the morning, they showed up at 5:50am. They arrived with a group of two guys who carried the tv into my bedroom, unboxed my tv, installed the tv stand, plugged it in for me, verified i had picture and that there was no damage done to the tv, I signed off on it and then they hauled away the box for me. Once we powered on the tv the setup process immediately detected the presence of my wifi connection. I then proceeded to check for firmware updates and there was one available for my tv which downloaded and installed without any problems. I was reading reviews here on amazon and some have reported a fluctuating brightness issue that seems to effect sets with a build date before August 2011. Since my set has a build date of July 2011 I was concerned I'd have problems. So far in the 11 days I have owned it I have not had any of the fluctuating brightness issues some had reported. Whether that is because of the firmware update or whether the issue is random I do not know, in any case the picture quality is stunning! Hands down the best tv I've ever owned. I have also yet to experience any image retention/burn in problems.I've tested the 3D capabilities using a Panasonic BDT-210 3D Blu-Ray player that I purchased here off of amazon. This player also comes with a mail-in offer promotional deal from Panasonic where they give you a free blu-ray copy of Avatar 3D, which Panasonic has the exclusive for. So far the 3D movies I've tested were The Lion King 3D, Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides 3D, and I just got done watching Avatar 3D. By the way Panasonic says to allow 8-12 weeks for shipping the Avatar 3D Blu-Ray and I received it in 2 weeks! Much better than expected wait time! All 3 movies had excellent 3D performance on this TV, but Avatar 3D was absolutely amazing!!! Avatar 3D is the standard by which all 3D movies should be made. The 3D glasses I used was the newer model Panasonic TY-EW3D3MU which is for the 2011 model Panasonic 3D TV's.  I bought the glasses here off of amazon for $65 shipped on black friday. When I purchased the glasses they were on backorder so I had to wait an extra week for those but totally worth the price I paid. I purchased 2 but wish I'd of bought 3 of them. Maybe the price will come down again later on and I'll pick up another pair. You have to charge the glasses when you first get them using the USB connections on the tv set. This process took around 30 minutes for me, and the charge is suppossed to last around 6 months.This TV has 4 HDMI inputs which I have made full use out of. Right now the 4 HDMI connections i am using is the Dishnetwork HD-DVR vip612, Xbox 360, Panasonic BDT-210, and my computer. I use THX mode for each connection except for the Xbox 360 which uses Game mode. This unit is excellent for video games as fast action scenes are played back without any stuttering or lag. The colors and details are excellent. Although this tv has a D-Sub connector which is meant for the PC, I do not use it for my computer since I prefer the HDMI connection which offers full 1920x1080p resolution. Note that when using this tv as a pc monitor you should also use the THX picture mode. THX mode is the only mode by default that does not have overscan which crops parts of all sides of the picture. However you can use other modes as well with your computer as long as you change the HD Size to Size 2, which is found under the Menu settings for Picture and Aspect Adjustments. Size 1 has overscan and Size 2 does not.Out of all the different picture modes I have tested I find THX mode to be the most accurate and the mode I suggest using overall. However if you want to get the best picture possible you will need to calibrate your tv set. Instead of paying for someone to come out to do this i searched google and found a calibration page for this model tv. The calibration settings I found were from the CNET forums. Since I cannot post any links in the review I will instead just paste the settings here.Picture mode: THXContrast: +75Brightness: +54Color: +52Tint: -2Sharpness: 0Color temp: Warm 2Photo enhancement: [grayed out]C.A.T.S.: OffVideo NR: OffPro settings: [grayed out]Aspect adjustments:Screen format: FULLHD Size: Size 2[others grayed out]PC adjustments: Grayed outAspect adjustments: [no change from default]HDMI settings: [no change from default]--Advanced picture submenu3D Y/C filter: Off [grayed out]Color matrix: HD [grayed out]Block NR: OffMosquito NR: OffMotion smoother: [grayed out]Black level: Light3:2 pulldown: On24p Direct in: 60HzThe Panasonic Viera-Cast is what you use to access the internet features of this tv. When I go into Viera-Cast it has these apps already installed. Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Video on Demand, Pandora, Youtube, Skype, Social Media apps of Twitter and Facebook, MLB.TV, NHL, MLS, Fox Sports, Wallstreet Journal live, Ustream, CinemaNow, PlayJam, Accuweather.com, Picasa Web Albums, AP, NBA Game Time 2011-2012. There's also some Panasonic apps as well. Panasonic Viera Connect Market which is for downloading new apps and games, Panasonic Support Center which I've thankfully not needed to use yet and I hope I never have to use it, and Viera Connect Settings. This has already a lot of apps but the one app that is missing that I wish was available is Vudu. Vudu is the only streaming service at the moment that you can rent and stream 3D movies. In the future i'm sure more streaming services will offer 3D streaming but for now Vudu is the only one. So not having Vudu as an installed app or even available from the Viera Market to download is dissapointing.One other complaint I have is that this tv does not have the analog audio rca red/white outputs. My older Panasonic G10 plasma had them and it's what I used to connect my tv to my home theatre a/v receiver. This tv instead has a Toslink Digital Optical output. However this was not a problem for me as I knew this before hand and bought myself a FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter here off of amazon which has worked perfect for me.In summary this is the best TV I've ever owned. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend this tv to anybody looking to upgrade to the world of HDTV or 3D. I did not purchase a square trade warranty like I did with my older Panasonic. The reasons being the outrageous pricing. SquareTrade wants to charge me $140 dollars per year for the warranty! Although this tv was listed as new it's still considered \"Open Box\" since the seal was broken. SquareTrade charges a much higher price for open box electronics so keep this in mind if buying a new open box or used tv and want to buy a warranty. Considering the deal I got on this tv buying the warranty wouldn't make any sense. I paid $900 shipped, and of that $900 I will get a $150 credit from Citi bank as I signed up for a new MasterCard and they have a promotional deal where you get $150 cash back when you make $750 dollars worth of purchases in the first 3 months of opening your account. This TV took care of that requirement and I've already received the credit on my first statement. So that coupled with the $18 dollars in ebay bucks I will receive, the tv will end up only costing me $732 dollars!", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply awesome picture", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R31BVRC6HBKDQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm basing this review mostly on the 2D picture quality of the set.  I didn't even buy 3D glasses and I have minimal interest in the internet app functionality.  But based strictly on picture quality, this TV is fabulous.  It was an upgrade from a HP 42 inch plasma.  The thing I noticed right away is the quality of the picture.  It's not crazy bright like the LEDs look in the showroom, but it is very accurate.  Skintones look natural and the whites and blacks are balanced which really helps bring out the detail in the picture.  Do some google searching for calibration settings to really bring out the best picture (or spend a bunch of $ to have somebody come out and do it for you).  THX mode is great, although the colors can use a bit of tweaking to get just right.  Movies, sports, video games, and regular TV programming all look great.The frame of the TV is very attractive too.  Very understated and not too big.  It fits the TV well.As for the concerns about fluctuating brightness on these sets (FBr), from what I've read online, this has now been addressed and fixed by Panasonic in later builds of this TV.  Sets built after August 2011 have an upgraded circuit board that resolved the issue.  I ordered mine in late November 2011 and received a set built in October and have had no problems.If you're into picture quality, this is the set for you.

My concerns were 1) the great room this TV was going into is super bright, 8 big windows; and 2) the room is huge and the 42\" TV I had mounted on the wall just looked tiny.I settled on this one because the 55\" was a better price point than the comparable 60\". I did look at a few 60\" LED TVs.  Because I like to watch a lot of sports and action movies, LCD/LED TVs were just non-starters.  Even some of the new claimed 240hz or others just can't get rid of the motion blur.When I got this TV delivered and set up I was impressed. After some recommended break-in and playing around with the settings, I find the picture quality amazing.  I did break down and buy some of the off-brand 3D glasses and the 3D performance is very cool (though not the main selling point for me).  DirecTV's 3D channels help but there isn't too much in the way of genuine 3D content.As for my #1 concern, glare, I don't think it's an issue. With any plasma, there is certainly more glare than an LCD screen.  There are about 2 hours in a given day when I have to get up and close some of the blinds to prevent the glare from being an issue. However, these are the hours when the full sun pours through all of the windows during the day when I'm not usually home.  My wife swears she doesn't notice the glare and thinks I'm crazy to even talk about it.Viera Cast is cool, though I wish they'd have a web-browser. I can't comment on the sound quality because I run everything throw a Pioneer Receiver and sound system. The TV does have an HDMI ARC(Audio Return Channel) which is vital for people running such a setup.  Make sure your home theater receiver supports ARC or you won't be able to hear sound from Viera Cast through your speakers.In short, buy this TV.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lifechanging", "Author": "D.

After reading some other reviews, I put the TV straight into THX mode and have not messed with any of the video settings after that.  It simply looks amazing without having to pay someone to come to your house to measure the video.  Avatar in 3D was somehow even better than in the theater.  Black Ops on Xbox in 3D is amazing as is the 3d offerings on DirecTv.  That being said, this is really a fantastic 2D TV that also has fantastic 3D.

Most of my viewing is sports and movies and almost always in HD.  Decided on this set though uncertain how often we will use the 3D feature and will wait for the cost of the glasses to come down.  Purchased this set because of the picture quality, most noticeably the black levels that the Sony couldn't quite produce.  The clarity and color quality is great, and the THX picture setting is a bonus.We did go to CNET for suggested calibration settings and they are different, and better, than the pre-sets.Only drawback was the audio.  The Sony had analog output for the audio which I ran through an analog receiver and through the same Bose speakers I use for CDs and albums and was generally happy.  This set only has digital audio and would require an adapter to convert the output from digital to analog so I could use my current receiver and speakers.  I've by-passed that by running the audio output directly from the DirecTV receiver and blu ray player into the receiver but it seems ever so slightly out of synch this way.  The existing audio through the TV speakers was \"OK\" but really not sufficient for watching an action flick.For resolution, we have added the panasonic sound bar which can connect with one hdmi cable.

I have done some calibration, and the picture is very natural, with deep blacks and nice tonality.Lots of reviewers have complained about poor sound quality.  From my very brief listen, I would agree, but it's irrelevant if you have a separate sound system.  If sound is important to you, getting even a basic surround sound system would be much better than the TV sound..I've played a bit with the online apps.  Youtube is a bit of a pain, but most remote-driven Youtube implementations I've seen kind of stink.  Lack of onscreen options and slow data entry make for a less than satisfying experience.  They should set up some kind of web-based interface where you can connect your computer to the TV through the network and paste video URLs in from YouTube.  Someone please do this!  Pandora is quite nice, and I think I'll use this often.  The first HDMI input supports Audio Return Channel, so if your receiver also supports ARC, you can pipe the sound from Pandora or Youtube or the other online apps (including Hulu and Netflix) back to your receiver via HDMI.

That is what differentiates this TV from other TVs I have used before. I tuned the TV using CNET's review settings using THX. It is really fantastic.Sound Quality:One reason I moved to this TV is because at least the speaker's sound quality are decent. Other TVs I was looking at that were LED-TVs (super thin) had tin cans for speakers.3D support:3D was very good to me, I used it to play the Uncharted 3 multiplayer beta and had no issues. The Avatar movie that it came with is really the benchmark for watching 3D movies. It was just like watching it in the theaters. Of course the downside to 3D is the glasses and the cost of glasses.

It does SD, HD, 3D and everything in between. The colors are perfect and warm. It's not too dark in a bright room, and the black levels are phenomenal.

The picture quality of this TV was awesome when I first viewed it and I would have happily given it five stars. The purpose of posting this review is to draw attention to a very poor design issue with this product and hopefully to prevent this from happening to someone else. For more information please feel free to search my pen name on AVS Forum for a more detailed discussion.Panasonic, like a lot of other TV manufacturers, are marketing their 2011 TV sets as being Smart TVs with internet apps like Skype, Netflix etc. It's a fantastic concept and it adds a richness to the home theater experience.The bad news is that one of these apps, Pandora, the internet music radio station appears to be defective and it could damage your TV set. Here's how it happened to me. I had done some research and reading on how image retention and burn-in were a thing of the past with plasma TVs. Don't believe the hype.When running Pandora, it displays what song is being played but most of the screen is taken up with a full screen static image made up of the Pandora menus. After a few minutes a screen saver engages and the picture starts to rotate as if it were a 3D envelope flying in space. That would be fine if it stopped there. However, the defect is that when the end of the song is reached and the next song starts playing it goes back to the same static image as before. This happens for every single song! The long term effect is that if you listen to Pandora for any period of time (as you might with a radio on) then for maybe 75% of the time the static image is being displayed on the screen. This then leads to damage of the screen because plasmas don't react well to having the same image displayed for a long period especially when they are new.Since I noticed the problem I have run the screen wipe feature and break-in slides consisting of full screen solid colors for many hours. While the images left by Pandora are fading a little they are still visible, sometimes even with normal TV viewing if there is a light colored sky or some other bright, light image on screen.My opinion is that this combination of badly designed software on hardware susceptible to burn-in is simply defective. The TV has incredible picture quality, so if you do buy it, just don't use this app. Netflix and the other apps I have used seem to have very reliable screen savers.Good luck!Andrew[UPDATE 11/10/11]: After several months the burn in seems to have gone away.

Yep the picture looks nice, and the sound was great.  It was cool to be able to connect to Amazon Prime or Netflix or show videos from the internet.  Given all the features and that the video looked great, I would say it would have been a 4/5 star; however, this TV and all Panasonic plasma TV's are defective.  Before you decide, you must do a search and you will see that many people are reporting this issue, each and every time, just outside the warranty.Given that this is a defective product, it doesn't deserve anything beyond a 1-star rating.

We thought this was a great TV.Until...At just 16 months (4 months after the warrantee expired) the picture went black and we (like numerous online posters) could see the \"7 blinking lights of death\".We were right in the middle of watching a game with some friends who had come over to watch with us, and suddenly- black screen. How embarrassing. And annoying.The tiny red LED power button light flashes 7 times, pauses a few seconds, then repeats 7 blinks, pauses...No picture at all.We tried the obvious things that were recommended by the call center. Unplugged the TV, unplugged the HDMI cable etc, waited, plugged it back in and the just got the 7 blinking lights again.I called Panasonic and gently explained that while this is just outside the warrantee, for a TV of this cost, going completely dead at 16 months is pretty unacceptable.The lady on the phone was useless. She was clearly trying to read responses to me from an online manual and knew less about the TV, troubleshooting, or customer service than my 7 year old child does. Kept saying things like \"so what you are saying is\" and repeating back to me what I had just said. She had no idea what was going on. I very politely asked to speak to a manager and after an eternity of waiting she picked the phone back up and told me she couldn't find a manager. But she'd have one call me. (fast forward...they didn't).She then gave me the phone number of a TV repairman in my area, and basically told me this is my problem. I guess technically it is. But this will be my last significant purchase from panasonic. And I purchase a fair amount of electronics (as do my friends, family and colleagues). So that will be Panasonic's problem.I went on line and looked the problem up and found that the number of postings for this exact problem is staggering. Any company that produces a high end product that has a critical flaw that commonly goes wrong between 2 and 20 months (and costs $500 or much more to repair according to online posts), yet doesn't have a recall, or any extended warrantee or exemption for that specific problem doesn't not have any comprehension of customer service or quality assurance.I guess this TV gets one star, because for less than about 1/5 of the life expectancy of a TV it was great.

Fantastic picture quality for the money and nothing really seems to come close. It is a Plasma so it has a fantastic viewing angle and great blacks but the screen is a bit reflective and not the brightest so you'll have to live with that.

I get on chat during business hours and again they can't help me but at least I get the right e-mail address.So I dutifully send the picture and wait, and wait another day then I start asking for updates every day or two. Still nothing. Finally I call again and I give them my case number and I'm told corporate has determined that this is not a manufacturing defect.Wait. What? Without physically looking at it or sending someone out to take a look? So I ask them if I can just get a service call so they can see that there is no damage to the set. Nope. It's on my dime. Finally I ask what would happen if the service person determines it's a manufacturing defect? They don't know. It's out of their hands.Stay away from Panasonic.

I'm one of the many who probably over-analyzed this purchase.  You know a product is high quality when its used price actually goes up over time.  This model is becoming hard to find, for good reason.  Having owned four previous 50-inch plasmas (2 Pioneer ELITEs, an older Panasonic Onyx top end model, and a Panasonic GT30), this 65-inch version is a long-awaited addition to the family.  Never mind the fact that the first three smaller models aren't 1080p and cost me literally thousands more, just note how well these televisions hold up.  If it's possible for them to improve with age, I think they actually might.  I still smile (at least in my mind) each time I see a high quality Blu-Ray or Directv signal on one of the older models.  I've had no regrets whatsoever about the earlier purchases, so I assume this newly acquired model will hold up well, too.I bought this 65GT30 used, but there's not even the slightest scratch visible.  Given the long useful life of a plasma TV, used is the way to go.  Kudos to Amazon for classifying this as in \"Good\" condition, as I can't see how this wouldn't be considered \"Like New.\"  I still own all four other plasma TVs, and each one of them was a display model by a traditional retailer.  The first three were on display at Hi Fi Buys which might be extinct by now, and the 50-inch GT30 was a display model at Best Buy.  I found used plasmas were a smart way to get the best technology at a big discount.  They are rated to last an extremely long time, so previous use is a non-factor.This was my first TV purchase via Amazon, and I can't sing their praises enough.  Who wouldn't want a 65-inch TV delivered to his/her home, anyway?  Free shipping makes Amazon the best value out there, especially in big ticket purchases.  The delivery was a snap and arrived in less than a week from the order date.  Aside from a big savings by going with last year's model, another factor in my decision was that I had already purchased a set of four active 3D glasses which are compatible with this model but not the 2012 GT50 version.  Finally, I prefer the all black stand to the gradation of black to silver stands in the 2012 models.  Wall mounting solves this dilemma and is great if you have the right space for it.My only fear is reading about some 55-inch versions of this vintage of VIERA plasmas that have had problems (three blinking lights, and no power).  Still, given my very pleasant past experience with plasma TVs, I'm confident this will make a fine purchase for many years to come.  When turned off, it is as elegant as a piece of fine furniture in my book.  When on, it seems far more realistic looking than any LCD I've seen.  Cnet has written extensively about this picture and cost advantage over the last decade, and the \"soap opera\" effect of LCDs is a legitimate concern to my untrained eye.  I suppose the knocks on plasmas for consuming more energy and risking burn-ins have some basis, but neither of those cons are a real factor for me.  If you go into Costco and ask them if they carry any plasma TVs, they will tell you that they can't keep them in stock when they can get their hands on them.  That's because sites such as Cnet, Consumer Reports, and now Amazon really help to spread the word to those who want to be as informed as possible.

Amazon had the best price by far so I ordered. I've been very happy with the purchase.I had a 52\" sony LCD wall mounted and wanted a bigger set to watch movies and football. I found that going with plasma bought me more screen realestate for the money. I don't intend to debate plasma over LCD but as other reviewers stated glare is a problem with this set so make sure it suits your room. I read about a buzzing noise on some plasma sets but can't detect it on this one.As far a picture quality goes plasma isn't as bright as LCD so it took a little getting used to. I think think the picture quality of this set is outstanding for the price and plasma also looks really good for movies. Football also looked good and motion blur was not a problem. The wireless connectivity works but I haven't spent much time with it because I use a Roku for Netflix, My TV is mounted to the wall so it was easier to run the Roku through the surround sound.I use a PS3 for DVD and purchased Tron 3D with the set. Blu-ray 3D was very good with generic glasses I bought from Amazon for less that half the price of the Panasonic glasses. I had switched from Directv to cable when I bought this set, cable had 3D programing available. I was quite happy with the 3D picture my cable company offered and was able to run the HDMI through my non 3D surround sound system. Unfortunatlely the cable pic in most other programming wasn't quite as good so I switched back to Directv and haven't been using the 3D much due to lack of programming on directv. Note that to get the Blu-ray 3D from the PS3 I used the latest HDMI cable plugged directly into the tv, sound was output via optical to the surround sound system. My surround didn't support HDMI in Version 1.4 but as I said early, the older cables or surround sound work with 3D from the cable box. (Search the internet for info)I have tried using the 2D to 3D conversion on this tv but it isn't worth it. It works but dosen't compare to a real 3D signal so I don't bother with it. I bought a 3D bowling game for the PS3 and really like the added effect and am looking for another game.Sound quality from the TV speakers is weak and the volume is only adequate. Its not a problem in a quiet room but background noise makes it difficult to hear.

I also bought the Panasonic Blu-Ray with integrated wireless and it has the same problem...oh, well.People rave about the quality of the picture, but compared to a Samsung 50\" I bought 2 years ago it can't compete.  Samsung has a much better \"natural look\"; with it you would swear you are on the football field, basketball court, or in the hockey rink (can you tell we like sports?).  Keeping in mind, however I paid twice as much from the Samsung...if I did not have the Samsung, I would think the picture was wonderful.The TXH setting for non-movie watching is awful but for movies it does a good job.  It is a nice TV and great for our situation for the money (I guess).I have not watched it as a 3D set yet.  Glasses are VERY expensive but I found 4 pair on E-Bay for the price of two from Amazon, so will up date when they arrive.

Peter", "ReviewID": "R1OX7BM8C95EM7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought the 50\" version of the TV for my parents as part of a new entertainment center surprise for Christmas.  I'm extremely satisfied with this TV for the purpose of TV and movies, it far surpasses anything I've seen on the LCD LED front.  The picture quality is fantastic, there are no words to describe how far the technology has come in the past couple of years, not to mention the price drop.  I personally own a 720p 42\" Panasonic TV which has excellent picture quality and this 50\" GT30 runs circles around it.  Unlike LED LCDs, this TV does not ghost in fast action movies.  I don't recommend the default THX settings... instead set it to THX and tweak the Color lower to 45 and the Contrast slightly to get accurate skin tones and color.  This TV set goes well paired with a Panasonic Dmp-bdt210 Blu-Ray player... another excellent product. The TV or Blue Ray remote can be used interchangeably without programing them. With the player, DVDs look just as good as the Blu Rays do.  The wireless internet connection works great, however don't have high expectations of full internet with this TV as everything is through an app... much like an iPhone.  Netflix, Hulo, and a special news feed version of Facebook work great.  Have not tried the Skype application but my parents want to use it when they get a compatible web cam.  There is no functionability yet viewing for email or web searching without hooking up a stand alone computer. Remember, its just a TV and who would have ever thought of having Facebook or streaming movies directly to it a few years ago?  There is a ways to go with the technology but I don't consider it a con because the TV does very well at what its designed to do.One con I want to mention was that my 42\" Panasonic TV came with a universal remote 5 years ago in 2007...  In 2011, this GT30 comes with an almost identical remote however its only universal with other Panasonic products -- its missing the buttons on the top to program as a full universal.  If you're looking to consolidate the TV, blue ray, receiver, and cable/satellite box on one remote a universal remote purchase is needed if non-Panasonic products are mixed into the system. I don't recommend Home Theater in a box so its a given.  I wish Panasonic would go back to the other remote as its a nice remote that is easy to read with big buttons and it has a simple layout unlike other brands.My parents received this TV with BDI furniture Cirrus 8158 in Expresso color [...].  The furniture is expensive but well built and worth the price.  It looks like it could out last the TV unlike the crap sold at other stores.  They also received a Marantz SR5006 receiver and Klipsch Reference series speakers in 5.1 arrangement.  My parents are very pleased with this present... prior to it they had a 27\" Sanyo TV and a 2.0 Stereo system daisy chained with coax and RCA cables to make it work.To put in a plug, I went through a local dealer who will setup and install the TV and media center: [...].  I highly recommend them if you are in the Wisconsin area and want professionals to assist in making your home theater top notch.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's like looking at live scenes through a window", "Author": "Ohio Guy \"neoguy\"", "ReviewID": "R36WC8FIQANV0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Delivery - it was one man and a truck scheduled to arrive within a 2 hour time period (he was on time).  I helped him carry it in, we lifted the box off together and plugged it in to ensure that it worked.  Then he left.  I waited for my nephew to come and help me.  Assembly of the stand is easy (4 screws, then 4 screws to secure the TV).  It's just such a wide TV that you need two people to lift it onto the stand and then on to your entertainment center.Plugging it in - it took you through a setup wizard, asked some simple questions, it figured stuff out, all worked.Had some snafus - I could NOT get the picture to look right with the cable box.  Then I discovered the handy \"INFO\" button on the remote.  This told me that my cable box was sending the TV 480i -- GASP!!  Switched it to 1080i and it was sharp and clear.  So, if letters come up on the screen somewhat pixelated from your cable box, check to ensure you're sending the TV the highest resolution.  Also compare the cable box to your DVD player.  If one looks good and the other doesn't then it's probably not the TV's problem, it is the box providing the signal (or the connecting cable).The other snafu was the that TV seemed so dim.  That's because the TV starts off in \"Standard\" picture mode which has a low contrast setting.  So I switched the picture to \"Custom\" and it was MUCH better!  Perfect in fact!We watched the 2D blu-ray version of 'Avatar' and it was AMAZING.  Somehow even in 2D it looks a bit 3D -- much more so than my previous plasma.  There are a zillion adjustments you can make to the picture in Custom mode like how bright you want the TV to be (which is not the same as \"Brightness\"), and so on so that you can get the picture to be just perfect.  So perfect in fact, we looked at each other and felt we were looking at live scenes through a window instead of viewing a TV.  Truly amazing.And FYI - the connection points are on the left side of the TV (left side as in when you're watching it).  So to keep cable lengths shorter, you're better off putting your receiver, DVD player, etc on the left side as well (otherwise plan on getting 8' to 10' HDMI cables).  The TV comes with a bunch of \"adapters\", like for optical digital audio cable and for composite video.  My guess is that the connections on the back of the TV can get tight especially when wall mounted, so the adapters help things to dangle easier.The \"Apps\" - the Netflix app took a day to work.  I didn't have \"streaming\" in my existing Netflix account, so maybe it took a day for it to get all worked out.  Meanwhile, I kept getting \"my code has expired\" and I had no clue why.  The next day when it finally did work, I discovered that Netflix really doesn't have much at all for streaming movies.  So then I tried the amazon app and it had TONS of movies available.  I haven't watched a movie that way yet, just watched a trailer or two, but it looks like it's going to work well.  The YouTube app was not very intuitive.  When you watch a video, the left half of the screen has the video information and the right half plays the video in a small 3 by 4 ratio box.  I saw no way to play a video in full screen, but thanks to the comment left by wasabi5858, I now know how to watch the video full screen -- you use your arrow buttons to highlight the video playing and then click OK to switch to full screen.

I was trying to decide between the Panasonic VIERA TC-P65GT30 65\" and the Samsung D7000/D8000 64\" models.  All had good reviews.  I was a little nervous in choosing because I was reading about the fluctuating brightness issues with both brands.  I ultimately chose the Panasonic after reading they had fixed the problem with a firmware patch.I was upgrading from a Toshiba 720p/1080i 57\" Cinema Series rear projection TV that I bought in 2005 (a 250lb monster). That was my second Cinema Series Toshiba, and first high def TV.  I was impressed at the time, but it did not have HDMI input (that was added the following year), and I was yearning to try out 1080p Blueray.  I chose the GT30 series because it adds THX mode that the ST30 did not have, and was much more affordable than the VT30.  It went on sale Thansksgiving weekend for $2320 with free shipping.  A good price.Delivery went smoothly, but they were HOURS late, and I was getting pissed off.  2 guys brought it into the house, and hooked it up to make sure it worked.  It did, after the guy figured out he installed the batteries backwards in the remote.  Sigh.I've had the TV now for about 3 weeks.  I set it to the THX mode, but made no other adjustments.  I have to admit that I am VERY impressed with the picture quality.  Especially with Blueray DVDs  The VIERA Connect tools work well for streaming Netflix and Pandora. Interestingly, the VIERA tools are much better than those on my newer DMP-BDT100 Panasonic blueray player.  The TV has much better controls and menu appearance than from the blueray player.And, I have had absolutely no problem with the fluctuating brightness that so many people have expressed concern with.  My unit was built in May 2011, and I immediately did a firmware upgrade when I first set it up.I cannot comment on the TV sound qaulity as I hooked it up to my home theatre system, which I purchased right before the TV - Denon 1912 receiver with Martin Logan 5.1 speakers (two Motion 12 fronts, two Motion 4 rear surround, Motion C center & Dynamo 700 subwoofer).  I can HIGHLY recommend that sound system by the way.I would purhase this TV again without hesitation.Now, I just need to find a good universal remote...it's getting old using 4 remotes for the system.

The internal speakers in the 42s are just fine for their use (bedroom and family room).

The lady at Pilot said that the 42s were not set to arrive until Thursday morning, and they might not be able to get them on the truck in time, but they would try their best.

I originally planned on picking up a Samsung D8000 LED LCD, because of the awesome picture, but I decided not to after discovering the input latency issue with video games. Apparently even in game mode, your looking at 60 ms delay or so where as the Plasmas have about 30 ms. This is probably not a big deal to a non video gamer, but a low input lag is a must when playing games like Halo. I scoured the internet to find a set with as nice a picture as the D8000 but without the faults and all signs pointed me back to to the Panasonic Plasmas.That said, I wrote off Plasmas a while back due to the issues inherent, such as screen burn in, short life and weight, not to mention cost. Well I'm here to tell you that this TV is just a little bit heavier than my old 55\" DLP Rear Projection set (90lb vs. 70), it's as thin as most LCDs, the life expectancy is rated at 30,000 hours and the image retention is almost non existent! I say almost because apparently if you watch ESPN all day or play a game all day without switching up, the image can become burned in, not to be confused with image retention.  There are however settings on the TV to further minimize this such as image shift(?) and there's the white bar wipe procedure that can be performed when retention is noticed.All in all, i'm very happy with the purchase and I can't believe how great the picture looks, but there are a couple of minor cons that i'll call out below.So to sum up..Pros:Great PictureThinVeracast Internet Browser (allows app downloads)Included wifi adaptorWeightLong LifeMultiple USB ports (good for video camera skyping and or flash drives and HD)Cons:Only audio output is HDMI or Toslink which is a problem not only for older Receivers but new 2 channel as well.

But you want an opinion of a guy who has had 6 HDTVs (dating all the way back to the first HD Mitsubishi) this is hands down awesome, easy to use, easy to setup and great.  Only thing I wish I could do is stream netflix directly from it rather than amazon tv (which I think sucks).  But I have a PS3, so its whatever.OH and on a side note, I thought the whole 3D tv was a huge scam and worthless, I actually tried to find a TV that didn't have it just because I thought it was such a rip.  They basically told me that all higher end TVs have this feature now so I just gave in.  But I must say I was pleasantly surprised when watching avatar in 3D.  Very cool.  Can't say much else about it since thats all I've watched in 3D, but it was cool.Also, just a quick dig at samsung if thats what your thinking about getting it and on the fence between this one and a samsung model.  I owned a samsung plasma and it died in 2 years.  My buddy owned a samsung LCD and it died in 2 years.  When I was shopping at best buy to just view the TV (wasn't about to buy it from them) I started talking to a guy who was looking to buy a new one as well.  Guess what TV he was replacing, a samsung, which lasted him 2 years.  My buddy bought a Panasonic Plasma 6 years ago and its still going strong, no problems at all.  I dont care what people say about samsungs great picture, and stylish design, and everything else.  They wont last for you, period.  Now I say that based on my experience on the others I mentioned, but seriously, if your in the market for a TV, buy a Panasonic.  Way better quality when it comes to Plasma and just TVs in general.

It has great picture and the THX settings provide natural color accuracy.  Many people have mentioned fluctuating blacks with Panasonic plasma TVs, but I have yet to experience this which is most likely due to disabling the auto brightness feature under ECO settings.  The sound from the TVs is as good as it gets from the two smallish speakers found in TVs, but really if your going for a TV like this you should also be looking to get a home theater setup as well.  Eventually I will get a denon or onkyo reciever paired with a 5.1 setup using polk audio monitor series II speakers.  All in all you should be satisfied with this TV.Updated 08/31/2011I recently tested out the DLNA feature and found that it worked great, for the most part.  So far I've tested it with videos stored on my computer, but will eventually set up a always-on DLNA server with external storage connected to my router.  Occasionally, when trying to pull videos from my computer using the menus on the TV it says no DLNA servers could be found.  I'm pretty sure this has something to do with the order in which I turned on the TV and the computer.  For Windows 7, a simple fix is to right-click a video file in Windows Explorer and navigate to the Play To option in the context menu and select Viera GT30.  If the Play To option isn't visible in the right-click context menu then open up windows media player and wait a few seconds (seems to turn on DLNA services). Then, retry using the Play To option.  After doing this once the TV should be able to find the DLNA server.  I believe once I have the always-on DLNA server through my router this issue should disappear.I've recently watched some high definition content on Syfy HD (1080i) and it looked stunning.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this plasma from Panasonic!!!", "Author": "Carrman217", "ReviewID": "RI41864K6UL7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first major purchase from Amazon, and I could not be more delighted.I did a lot of research before I bought. After doing some homework and seeing the reviews of others here on Amazon and other sites, I made my choice. I waited for about 2 months before I wrote my review, just to make sure I was not going to mislead anybody. With that said, I knew I had made the right decision when my wife and I were sitting in front of it and she says, \"I don't like it. Everything seems so big.\" We do sit about 10 feet away from the TV, but I agree with some other people who recommend you sit a little closer to the set, so that you can see all the details, especially with 1080P. Delivery was fast and professional. They open the box up to insure that there was no damage. I did not start watching the TV right away as that I wanted to do a proper break-in.(Highly recommend this, better safe than sorry...) I used a SD card of various pictures with the tv set at 50% of all picture settings and in \"Just\" mode. I let it run 24/7 for 4 and 1/2 days. Then the fun began. I hooked it up to my home theater and was blown away. The picture is great! I played around with various settings before I determined that the THX mode was the best. (This was also after using some custom settings found on other web sights.)I have had no issues with floating black levels to date. I purchased my unit with a free AVATAR 3D movie and 2 pairs of glasses. Could not use the movie as it does not seem to play in my PS3. But I have used the glasses with my Xbox360 and Call Of Duty: Black Ops. Have to say, I was pretty impressed. Mind you, it is not as good as you would see in a theater, but I found it pretty sweet none the less. Sound is not that great out of the TV speakers. I highly recommand a home theater set up. Make sure that you have an optical cable if you are planning to use apps like Pandora in a home theater set-up.Internet set up was a breeze with the included WiFi dongle. Don't know how much I will use it, but still a nice feature. Hope they will put out some nice updates. Bottom line is for the money and the quality of this plasma, you could do a lot worse, and not a whole lot better than this unit.

After viewing Pioneer KURO 60\" TV that cost $7000 when it came out, I was speechless. Panasonic cannot match that kind of black level but it is significantly better than other LED, LCD, or plasma I've seen so far. The Samsung 8000 series LED with a local dimming is very close but I've noticed that lighting sometimes is not uniform and it cost $2k more which I would not spend. The latest Visio 65\" 3D actually had very good picture but I wanted active 3D rather than passive 3D technology so I passed. Somehow I feel cheated by 540+540=1080 theory using a passive glasses theory in spite of cheaper 3D glasses.After receiving TV from Amazon, setup which was very easy. Delivery service was superb as well. The box was in perfect shape. The TV comes with Wi-Fi dongle if you don't have Ethernet cable and I tested both connections and Wi-Fi works okay if you have N protocol wireless router. If you are still on G, go with RJ-45 cable or buy N router. I was surprised by Panasonic remote controlling my PS3 unit which was added bonus. DNLA certified (Windows 7 PC or DNLA certified equipment) unit's media was immediately available if you are into streaming your downloaded contents. Other TV bonus such as Netflix, Amazon, Skype, and etc. works as well as other equipments that have similar functions. I use my PS3 so it was lightly tested to verify its functionality. I pulled in local HD broadcastings from built-in TV turner using an antenna, it seems to lock well, and channel change is quick. I've used both HDMI and Component cable for 1080P and 1080i viewing. The latter connection has to go through dongle rather than direct to TV due to lack or spacing.I left a full screen TV mode with HD broadcasting on for about 8 hours for initial phosphor burn in process which settles the entire TV screen (something I believe and not proven). Afterwards, I tweaked the picture settings with THX mode with some adjustments to suit my viewing preference. I have not done extensive tweaking yet since TV is still too new so after about two months, I will use Spyder TV calibration unit to tweak the color, contrast, brightness, and gamma. For the time being, it is acceptable for initial review. First demo disc was none other than \"master and commander\" which will show just how well dark scene will be displayed. It was impressive to say the least. I watched Tron 3D which was very impressive but not being used to 3D glasses, I still prefer great 2D picture. LOTR extended edition arrived and I've watched both DVD and Blu-ray version to see how well non-HD pictures looks and it was decent. I used my older Toshiba HD-DVD player that has better DVD up conversion than my PS3 with 1080i native output and TV's 3:2 pulldown seems to work well to display 1080p. Blu-Ray picture on LOTR was excellent. I did try 24 frame output with LOTR which was good at 60Hz but with only 48 Hz, it was flicking too much. The fact that it can handle 1080P/24 seems a bonus.  It was a time to return to Pandora with Jim Cameron. Wow, it was most impressive color display I've seen so far. It looked spectacular and even my spouse gave a thumbs up on this TV. I've watched some streaming DivX and MKV encoded files and it looked acceptable for being a large TV.There are a few things I did not like on this TV which I can live with but wish Panasonic would consider changing. The TV power on red LED is bothersome to me. I would probably tape it with dark film.  Panasonic should replace it with a smaller LED and less bright. If you are not mounting this TV, the TV stand is ugly. Because it is so ugly that I've decided to mount it.  It probably is the ugliest stand currently available. I am not even going to review the built in speakers. Get a sound bar or use surround sound system. It is that bad. Not even a single 3D glass was included with the TV. Panasonic has a frequent promotion on two pair of 3D glasses and Avatar 3D so use that promotion if you can wait. The material cost of that 3D glasses are probably less than $30 so not including a single glasses seems cheap tactics by Panasonic.I have not tried PC output with TV yet. Since I have no plan to have HTPC connected to TV, probably will not check how it looks. My understanding is the resolution is very limited on Panasonic.Other than that, it is one awesome TV for Blu-Ray fans. I'll keep it for three years and buy 72\" when the price drops. I am not concerned with black level changing on Panasonic plasma TV which seems to be a hot debate for many 09-10 year models. For $3k or less, this is one great TV for home theater buffs who can't have a projector.

Killzone 3 produced so much crosstalk during the game and cutscenes that it was almost unbearable. I have tried THX and Game mode, as well as customizing the settings as much as I can possibly do.This is my first 3DTV, my fourth HDTV and I have to say, in normal 2D mode the picture is truly amazing.

The first time we bought the TC-P50G25, it worked great. Great picture, great sound, great apps and overall a very good plasma TV. Unfortunately, it did not last too long after our kid cracked the screen with one of his toys. We had it only for four months. But because there was a cracked screen, we could not get a replacement. We even purchased additional 3yrs of warranty when we bought it, but we were all out of luck. Panasonic crossed their arms and looked away.Despite this we decided to purchase another Panasonic. We went with the TC-P50GT30, a model slightly newer. This definitely lasted more than four months. We were smart this time around to purchase a screen protector for the television. But, almost two years later it just stopped working!! After searching the forums and Google we had what is notoriously known as the seven (7) blinks of death!! Considering this time the TV lasted for over a year, we called Panasonic and asked for their assistance and get what they did? If you guessed, \"they crossed their arms and looked away\" you are right on! I think the best thing would have been to add this TV to our insurance policy.Its unfortunate, this is really a great TV. It has all the essentials that I and my family need such as built-in Ethernet and wireless via a dongle for tapping into our DLNA devices and many other features. My experience is that TV's today, especially those from Panasonic are just too fragile. For the price point one would think they are purchasing a reliable TV, but they are very delicate. At least that is from my experience. This time around I'll just purchase the parts and try to fix it myself from what I have read in the technical manuals. We will see how that goes. But one thing is for sure. Next time around we will definitely not purchase another Panasonic.Like I said the TV's we have purchased and used in the past from Panasonic were fabulous, but they are not reliable. At this point and willing to give another manufacture a try. This is just my personal opinion, but I really wish Panasonic would correct their quality issues with their electronics. The TV just stopped functioning without any valid reason. To me this is a malfunction, a defect in the product.

The blacks were excellent, the colors were rich, the viewing angle was great, the VIERA features worked well, and it was a handsome-looking set.

Panasonic was great on the phone when I called them, and I noticed this problem most in the \"Standard\" pre-set. I figured/hoped it was an issues w/my settings. Over the next several months, however, it grew worse and showed up more frequently. Soon, the overall picture was faded and no amount of setting adjustments would help. By the time the panel was obviously shot, Panasonic essentially told me I was f'd, and gave me the number of a local, authorized repair shop. Fortunately, I bought the TV with an AMEX card, which extended my warrantee for a year, and I called it in to them just shy of 2 years after I purchased it.Incidentally, the shop told me that the panel and labor would cost more than the TV cost new, so it's totalled.

This was priced last year for about $1,700.00.  Some sellers are now asking $2,300.00 and up for a 2011 model.  This has an excellent picture and although there is some mirrored reflection on the screen, the price and quality of Panasonic is what it is.  I have only purchased Panasonic televisions and I have never had a problem with one for over 30 years.  It is doubtful that I would ever purchase another brand of Television PERIOD.  My only regret is that I only purchased one at this price, but I simply did not have any room for another big Panasonic Plasma television.  Although it has a USB port and you can put in a 64GB micro memory stick and watch digital Blu-Ray or DVD movies, television shows, etc., the USB port will not recognize an external 3TB hard drive.

It replaced my 40 inch Samsung LCD, which at the time I thought was near perfect.  During the process of buying my GT30 I bought a Sharp 60 LCD and returned that for a Samsung 55 LED, but both of them seemed to have major flaws.  The LCD was extremely heavy, hard as hell to mount the stand on it and had a very grainy picture quality compared to other TVs at the price.  The LED looked really sleek with its extra thin bezel and a weight that without an awkward size I could almost mount myself, but when viewing dark scenes where there were also portions of bright lighting the LED panels on the right and left side of the TV gave off a terrible glow; the glow only got worse the more off center from the TV you sat.  Once returning those 2 TVs, the before mentioned problems became bonuses to the Panasonic.  TO ALL LCD/LED OWNERS, FORGET EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW ABOUT PLASMAS!  Even in a brightly lit room I had no problem viewing dark setting TV/movies, which has been a huge complaint of plasmas.  The weight is not as light as an LED, but still weighs less than an LCD.  The humming some people mention is inaudible unless you're right next to it and this comes from someone with exceptional hearing.  It only costs $10 more a year to run this TV compared to an LED, so all that jazz about LED's saving money is a scam; if you can afford this TV or an LED then the $10 is nothing.  This is the PERFECT type of TV for someone into gaming or sports, because the refresh rate demolishes anything even the $3500 LED's offer to provide a much smoother looking picture quality.  The colors are a little more dulled than the LCD and LED, as they are in real life, so you aren't left with oversaturated colors that can bleed into eachother.  The bonus THX picture mode (only offered in GT and VT models) is a VERY nice bonus to help with TV dramas and blu ray movies.  I was able to get my GT30 for a staggering price of only 1100 from HHGregg after talking the sales guy down some, which saved me almost a grand over what a \"comparable\" LED would be.

It was the cheap after market glasses I bought.  Panasonic glasses work flawlessly.Original review: So far, so good.  The TV has been up and running for about a week and a half.  I'm treating it gently during its break-in period, so I haven't really messed with color or brightness settings so far.  I'm not a real videophile, so I don't know much about deeply evaluating how true the colors are or how easy the set is to calibrate. I have it on the THX setting right now, and I like the way it looks. But there is plenty of customization possible with the picture and about everything else I could imagine wanting to tweak.The only problem I've had is with the 3D feature, and then only once in a while. I haven't watched a whole lot of 3D yet, but the problem I ran into had to do with maintaining the sync with the glasses.  I'm using aftermarket glasses, so I can't comment on whether this would be a problem with the Panasonic branded glasses. The problem comes during very bright scenes, specifically (in my case) the death scene in the last Harry Potter movie.  The TV, being a plasma, emits a great deal of IR light, especially during very bright scenes. This seems to overwhelm the receiver on the glasses and cause them to lose their sync with the IR signal from the 3D transmitter on the TV.  I solved the problem the same way many Samsung plasma users have had to, by covering most of the receiver area on the glasses with black electrical tape. This worked on all four of my pairs of glasses, but it required me adjusting the tape a few times to find just the right amount of sensor to leave exposed. I haven't read much about this happening with Panasonic plasmas, so it might be a problem with my specific set, but the workaround cost me 53 cents and worked very well, so I'm not too concerned.Overall, I'm thrilled with the picture quality and have no real complaints at all about the TV.

I haven't looked at the competing TVs very closely but I like the natural tones and lack of digital artifacts in the plasma picture.Network features - it was pretty amazing to plug the TV into the power outlet, connect the wifi dongle, configure a few settings and start watching a HD movie from Netflix with the power cable being the only wire leading from the TV. That's what I call Network-ready.Of course, nobody is likely to set up the TV this way. Most will want to supply their own speakers and sound system to get an audio experience that's up to par with the picture this TV provides. I've experimented with a bunch of the network features and they all seem to work as advertised - for example, with DLNA I can browse through the audio tracks stored on my PC and stream them through my sound system. Would someone do this? It's a question of convenience - you can switch from watching TV to listening to music using the same remote.Build quality is very good - the stand is made of about half inch of solid die cast aluminum (wasted on me because I wall mounted the TV), materials and finish are nice.Most of your connections to the TV (other than HDMI) are through supplied dongles - one for component inputs, PC input etc. This makes sense - it avoids taking up precious space on the side profile. Most people are only going to use a few of the connectors.Yet I have one complaint - the glare from the surface is noticeable, surprisingly more than from the six year old low-end LCD TV that it replaced. I haven't seen others complaining about this which is puzzling. Makes me wonder if that Panasonic missed some step in its manufacturing process.Another thing - I did observe the fluctuating brightness problem reported by some of the other owners.

When I first bought my HDTV, I ran it for a full week with \"plasma break-in\" color slides for about 7 days, 24/7 (my electricity bill can vouch for that). I was weary of image retention issues and \"burn-in,\" but most people cast that off as an urban myth regarding recent models of plasma televisions, especially if broken in properly.Regardless of my efforts, after playing Battlefield 3 for a few hours this weekend, I notice some image retention in white/yellow screens, resembling the outline of bright text that pops up on the HUD during online play. Now, it's barely noticeable to most, but if you're a audio/visual-phile like I am, it can be a bit vexing/noticeable once you're aware of its presence. I've heard that image retention \"goes away\" after 3-4 hours of watching other content, but it has remained even after leaving my television run break-in slides over night. I'm hopeful this will go away eventually; however, it's made me consider buying a secondary LED-LCD to use as my \"gaming\" television and leaving my plasma dedicated solely to movies and television.This is a notable issue to consider when researching what HDTV you wish to buy (especially if you have a love for gaming).", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best TV but the internet DLNA is lacking", "Author": "HarleyRedVrod", "ReviewID": "R11XFP0RCMHI7P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the TC-P55GT30 along with the Home theater SC-BTT770 system.

I briefly owned a Samsung 6400 series 46 inch LED-LCD tv which had great picture, but the famous screen uniformity just drove me nuts. This is especially noticable when watching blue ray content because of which i returned and decided to do some research. A lot of stores like best buy and frys keep plasmas, led-lcds and lcds in different sections because of which you can make a fair comparison and try to push LED-LCDs to the customer. However the Magnolia store near my place displays them side by side. And this tv was placed beside a 55d8000 series samsung LED-LCD and i just could not take my eyes off the 55GT30, well i would have picked up the VT30 if it was in my budget. The blacks were way better and the screen was perfectly uniform. From that moment I made up my mind, and also thanks to the smart sales guys at the store who suggested me that LED-LCDs are just marketing BS.Pros:- Fantastic Black Levels- Thickness comparable to LED-LCDS.- Perfectly uniform screen.- Movies look very accurate in THX mode.- Not yet seen any image retention.Cons:- Sound could have been better.- Swivel does not rotate.- would have loved to have the thin bezel.- Out of the box i did notice the brightness randomly fluctuate and I was concerned, but i figured out that the CATS feature was turned on by default and after turning it off the problem was gone. CATS is the feature that varys the contrast based in ambient lighting. Please disable this once you receive your TV.Great Special pricing from amazon and great shipping. The shippers(CEVA) were very helpful, helped me unbox and install it.5 star service from Amazon..... THey are the best...Also BTW, i received the Tv in the third week of January, and this is a tv that was manufactured in Dec 2011. It came preloaded with the latest firmware so no update was required.

It replaced a Sharp Aquos 60 inch LED that died after about 2 weeks of owning(see my other sharp review) This is my 3rd Panasonic Plasma TV. I still own and use all 3 Panasonics a 37\", 50\" and now a 60\".So far this TV has exception color depth and texture. Skins on faces have richness and texture to them and do not appear clayish or discolored as the LED TV I owned appeared. My understanding the texturing comes from having some of the best darkness that brings out textures. From this it is my opinion buying the higher end was well worth the extra money.I watch sports football and hockey. The picture quality and smoothness of motion is very nice. The viewing from angles is fine as well.  As compared to the LED, there is none. the LED had a jitter or a blur or a bending of lines depending on the motions being fast or slow or the colors moving and a white out of the screen when veiwed from angles. I see none of that with the GT30.An added feature I like I did not find on the other brand is a sleep timer. This with the sleep timer on my surround sound is nice since it shuts off the TV if I fall asleep.The network configuration was easy, I skipped the dongle and just plugged the USB into the back of the TV. I configured the wireless network and password using the remote and found the devices on the network. I signed up for the Viera connect and can watch some free TV and movies through there many interfaces.The only complaint so far is that unlike the Sharp that had more of a keyborad layout for typing using the remote, this has a cell phone type pad and a more advanced layout with the @ key for the dot com.That and the wallmount locations on the back of the unit sat lower on the TV making me have to lower the mounting brackets on the wall.I have not gotten any 3D glasses so I can not comment.I gave it 4 stars since it does not have a web browser interface and one can always do better or find soemtehing better eventually", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV", "Author": "K.

This TV grew up on me every day I've used it (had it for a couple of months now).What I did not liked about:1. It makes a buzzing sound when the screen is completely black. It is not loud, and I am already used to it, but the buzzing is there.2. When I turn it on, it takes about 20-30 seconds to recognize my wireless router. After that all the internet functions work flawlessly (I use Netflix every day).3. The smart TV apps are slightly slow to react to the remote. This is not a big deal, but smooth animations and transitions would show off the display better.4. Sometimes there are little banner ads from Panasonic on the bottom of the screen for about 5 seconds when I turn the TV on. What is up with that, Panasonic? I paid for this thing, please keep the adds for yourselves, thank you.What I did liked:1. In gaming mode, the display is amazing. I was worried about lag when using my PS3 on 1080p, but there is none. I play FPS games (Resistance 2, Killzone 2, etc), and the experience is completely immersive.2. The video quality is outstanding. What they say about plasma is right on. The cinema and THX modes are amazing for movies, and the 3D effect is outstanding.3. I was worried about burn-in of images. It did not happen, and I had no special care with this TV set. If I freeze any video source, is will go into a screensaver move after a little bit, and dim the display. The Netflix app does better, it has its own screensaver.4. The design of the set is beautiful, and it is incredibly thin (I still cannot believe how skinny does it looks from the side, it is almost unreal).5. Delivery by Pilot was excellent, and Amazon was very good at accommodating my schedule. I was worried about it because I though it was a fragile/large item, but was amazed at the service. And it was free (I have Amazon Prime).6. The sound is very good. I was concerned about people saying you need to purchase an external soundbar, but give this a try on its own. I have it in a large, carpeted room, and never went above 50% of the volume. Yes, sure, it will not rock the house, but it is more than adequate for movie watching and game playing.7. The 3D effect is very impressive. I only use this from time to time, but the effect is comparable to what I experience on a 3D theater.Overall, I am very happy with this TV, and would recommend this to anybody.

The quality of the Panasonic TV is fantastic. I wanted the 1080p per eye picture quality that comes with Active 3D Only, and I'm very happy with it.  My only concern has been burn-in, after further study I'm less concerned about that with this product.  Just be careful, follow break-in instructions, it doens't seem that bad to me.  I did buy the Square Trade 4 year warranty through Amazon which is very cheap by comparison to Best Buy's warranty offers.  The 3D on the TV works great.  The 2D to 3D conversion is fine but not very useful, I wouldn't count on that feature being very amazing...  It just doesn't look like the native 3D content at all.  I've been able to download some sample 3D content over my playstation, which looks great.  I've read things that say Active 3D erradicates eye strain/nausea.  Let me just throw out there, if you usually have dry eyes, eye strain, and limited feelings that you may throw up, you'll probably have the same experience with this.  I have the same thing, but at least for me it doesn't progressively get worse.  I just have a little nausea and dry eyes that never worsens while I watch 3D content.  Oh well, doesn't bother me that much.  While the HDMI cables I chose do handle data as well as audio/video content, the Panasonic P55GT30 does not support the data feed. So you will need an cat5e cable, or to use the built-in wireless.  I do recommend a wired connection though.  You're going to want to pull down heavy audio/video streams over the web and it would be best to avoid the inconsistency of WIFI.  With my wallmount, i just have 2 cables going back through the wall to my receiver: 1 HDMI, 1 cat5e.  I did not purchase a wall mount, the mount left at the house that I purchased could handle 110 lbs and fit my panasonic TV just fine.  Sorry, I don't recall the brand, and it is behind my television!  Make sure you pay attention to the specs on the P55GT30 as far as mounts go.  It is not a standard size but most mounts can be adjusted to fit.  Look up the manual as it is available in PDF format online.All mediabridge cables work great.  No problems at all with 3D content or quality.The SainSonic Active 3D glasses work great, although the instructions were a hard read for me.  I had problems getting them to detect my 3D on 2D to 3D conversion.  Set them up initially while viewing native 3D content, and once they're setup, you can go ahead and view the 2D to 3D conversion content if you like.The speaker system and receiver are awesome.  The quality of all is very good, I just plugged everything into my TV and everything started up right away.  I had 1 misplaced speaker wire but it was very simple to troubleshoot on the receiver end.  I did buy the banana plugs for the speaker wires because I like the convenience but it is certainly not a requirement.  I've had no problems with this setup except with the wireless transmitter/receiver I tried to put on the subwoofer and reciever (see below). Sorry for the non-technical review of the audio, but I don't have the knowledge.  I did read reviews that the receiver causes a buzz in the speakers when listening to certain content, I've not experienced that whatsoever.  The quality seems perfect to me, and my very observant wife would be happy to point out the buzz if it was there.The Soundcast SOU-SCK510 SubCast Wireless Transmitter/Receiver System for Subwoofers had to be returned because it was creating a feedback buzz in all speakers/subwoofer connected to my receiver.  I ended up just putting the subwoofer next to the receiver, which I am only minorly disatisfied with.  Amazon handled the refund right away and there were no problems with the return.  UPS came and picked up the box from my house the next day, with their own shipping label.  It was very easy.  Reading reviews on these transmitters/receivers makes me think the technology is just not where it needs to be to satisfactorily hook up a subwoofer over wireless.  Might as well wait for it to improve, and maybe get cheaper...

I was nervous ordering from Amazon because I did not want to go through the return process if it came broken, but the TV came in perfect condition and the delivery man stayed until I had the TV set up and plugged in to make sure it was in perfect condition. I know nothing about TV's and bought this based primarily on other reviews. The final selling point was seeing this TV side by side at a box store with the Samsung 8000 LED, their best TV I was considering. Once side by side I could see the plasma had richer colors so I went ahead and bout it on Amazon. The best thing I can say is the picture is incredible, words can't describe how good it looks, which is what I wanted in a TV. I have not tried all the extra features, but the veracast menu is simple and I will get around to it soon. Netflix works great with this television, I use streaming all the time now. The sound is not great, but none of these flat screens have a good sound, so I bought the sony HT150 sound bar for 300.00 and it sounds great for a minimum price investment.The bad---- One thing I did not like, to get this unbelievable picture, you have to know something about calibration and have a good eye, I don't. I use primarily the THX mode, because everything looks good on that mode, but I went to reviews on line where others have posted their settings and I used some of them in custom settings menu. That was the way to go, I now have the perfect settings for main TV viewing using these settings. One thing you will notice is the picture looks different on many different channels because this TV will show clearly the exact signal coming in. So you need different settings based on the content your using. But if your watching clean 1080 or Blue Ray, you will experience as I did for the very first time what PERFECTION is all about.

Getting help with setting up Vierra Connect through Wi-Fi was a complete nightmare.I am an MCSE (network engineer) who tried everything I could think of before even calling for customer support.  I found out that my TC-P65GT30 would connect to my Wi-Fi router if I removed the password from the router therefore disabling all security.  My cell phone, my tablet and my Panasonic Blue-Ray player could all connect to my router when I put the security back on the router.  I bought a brand new router, just to try to connect my new TV.  Same thing, the TV could not connect to the new router.  The new router also had a push button connect, in which on the router side said that it found the TV.  However on the TV side, it kept searching for minutes until it failed.I went to Panasonic's website.  No information on this issue.  The website's recommendation was to register the product \"to be able\" to receive firmware updates and other support.I registered the TV, and my Blue-Ray Player.  The TV had the latest firmware which listed version 2.200 as having fixed Vierra Connect issues.I called the support number in which a woman for 45 minutes had me retyping a password over and over.  All things I have already done - just so she could know that I was typing the password case sensitive.  One good thing I learned is how to Reset the TV after it locks up (after every failed network search) - hold volume on the TV and Menu on the remote for 10 seconds then Power off/on (TV button). She said the issue would be escalated.  I think she meant the same day someone would review the case information and get back to me.  At the 45 minute mark is when we got disconnected.  She did not call back.I called again a few minutes later and spoke to a guy this time, who read the case information and said that the first woman \"went beyond\" what Panasonic support normally does.  He continued, saying \"we don't usually do what she did\" and that she \"went to the edge\".  This guy could only suggest I try connecting to the 2.4Ghz frequency on the router instead of the 5Ghz, and also to try changing the password to something simpler.  He said the case would be escalated at that I should call back in \"24 hours, no 2 days\" to \"see\" if they had any other ideas for me to try.I called the next day and spoke to a different woman who read the case information.  Rather than answer me as to what research had been done, she tried to start me from square one with typing in the password again.  I went along up to a point when I asked \"When is the part where we are doing something different than I already tried?\"  She put me on hold several times and I could tell she was speaking to her manager and telling him the limited information she knew.  Of course the manager is going to believe I am typing in the wrong password - there is no need for him to talk to me.  The woman comes back on the phone and states pure and simple that the TV is \"Working Properly\" and that I need to contact my cable modem manufacturer (the cable modem is connected to the router.  The router has the Wi-Fi.  The cable modem is not part of the equation).  She says the case will be escalated and that I should call back in 5 days!!!  I told her I wanted to speak to a manager now.  After being on hold she said a manager would have to schedule to call me back in a couple of hours.  I never got a call back from the manager.I drove to the Panasonic repair dealer and the dispatcher was very nice and understanding of my problem.  I showed her the 2nd router I bought and she said that they are not set up to be able to test the router at the repair facility (???!!!).  She pulled up the case information on the computer and dispatched a technician to come out the next day.The technician who comes out speaks English with an accent, but what's worse is he knows nothing about computers, or networking.  Before he even understands my issue, he calls tech support and tries to convey my issue over the phone.  They tell him that this is a known problem and that I need to call this other tech support number.  At this point, the last thing I want to do is call tech support.  Somebody needs to actually SEE the issue.  His belief (from what he was told just 2 minutes ago) was to hook my cable modem directly into the TV though an ethernet cable connection.  In order to go along with his theory, I had to relocate my cable modem and router from my computer room.  I also had to setup a laptop to view the router settings.  This process made it difficult for me to try to demonstrate the issue to him.  After rebooting the modem, router I showed him that the Blue-Ray player could connect to Vierra Connect.  With NO password on the router I also got the TV to connect to Vierra Connect.  At this point the technician was on the phone and the support person said that my problem was that I could not connect the Blue-ray and the TV to Vierra Connect at the same time.  This is a lie.  I disconnected the Blue-ray and said, \"OK, now how should we proceed?\"  He said that \"nothing else can... (oh never mind - He knows nothing also).  As far as this guy is concerned, he is done - he is typing the solution to the ticket as \"Told not to hook more that one thing at a time to Vierra Connect\".  I ask for his name, but neither myself or the technician in my house can understand his name clearly (I had him on speakerphone the whole time).  After 20 minutes of being on hold a manager gets on the phone named Andre.  Andre tells me the \"real\" name of the last guy.  BTW, they gave me a completely new case #, probably none of the new people having read the original case information.  Andre asks who is going to troubleshoot the issue and my response is that the technician should and, \"Panasonic built it, you are the repair people, you fix it\".  I'm wondering why I'm having to do everything.  The technician was just sitting on my couch the whole time.  As I am getting Andre up to date on the issue and explaining that this technician has no computer/networking skills, the technician still wants to hook the cable modem directly into the TV and I am almost arguing but urging the tech to stay until the resolution of this issue.  To make a long story... He leaves, and I'm left with Andre.Andre finally gets my TV working with Wi-Fi with password encryption!  The solution.  Do NOT use WEP encyrption method.  Use WPA2-PSK instead.  Andre said that many people were having this issue.My question to him was, then why did NONE of the other tech support people know about it, and why was there no mention of it on the website?And, it would be stupid to connect to Vierra connect from the Blu-ray and the TV at the same time.  However, after everything was working I connected to Vierra connect on the Blue-ray and had a YouTube video showing, then I went to the TV's Vierra connect which shows a reduced Blue-Ray image (of the YouTube video) in the center of the TV's Vierra Connect Menu.  The menu also showed the YouTube, and other preview icons.

The purchasing/delivery process with Amazon was smooth.  Three days after I bought it, the price went down by $225.  Amazon gave me a credit for the same amount, which was great.As to the TV, it's an excellent value for the money.  Based on my reading of the Amazon reviews and other web forums, I was worried about getting a unit with excessive buzzing and/or the fluctuating brightness (FBr) issue.  Much to my chagrin, the TV I got had both issues.  However, from reading the forums it seemed that it's a bit of a lottery as to what you get, depending on manufacturing date.  So I called Panasonic service rather than trying my luck with an exchange.  They replaced a couple of boards, and all is well.  I'm coming from having owned LCDs the past few years, and the difference is striking.  Much richer colors and warmer image.  Motion handling blows away my old KDL-40XBR6, as does black depth.  However, it seems like I do need to be more careful about watching 4x3 content due to burn-in risk.  For that small price, I'm getting a much more cinematic experience.  The sound quality is not terribly impressive, but I knew that going in.  I'll be using a surround sound system, so the built-in speakers won't get much utilization.I'd give the TV 5 stars were it not for the FBr and buzzing issues.

And to be honest they are quickly in the process of making it right. This is also only a review on a bad shipping experience since I am unable to review the product as it was already destroyed on arrival. Nevertheless I feel obligated to relay my experience with purchasing a large screen HD tv from Amazon.The TV was ordered on November 15th along with an HD 3d BluRay player, and a pair of 3d glasses (why aren't they included?) for a grand total of $2300. The BluRay player and glasses got here in about 3 days. The TV just arrived yesterday after 2 weeks. No problem, it was free shipping and I liked the 24 month no interest deal. I was at work when they delivered (they give you about a 4 hour window and they only deliver on Wednesdays in my area). My wife signed for the TV and had the guys just put the box in the living room without it being opened. I arrived a few hours later and noticed the box was in perfect condition. No scratches dents or dings could be found. I was happy because I had been leery of ordering this TV after having read several nightmare stories about HomeDirect shipping. Anyhow when I opened up the box I found the remote, manual and all the cords and attachments to be professionally sealed and in obviously new condition. Unfortunately the good news ended there. When I pulled the soft packing off the tv and removed all the cellophane I saw, much to my disappointment, large cracks from the upper left hand corner all the way over to both the upper and lower right hand corners of the TV. It was a spiderweb effect, completely destroyed and needless to say I was not too happy.I understand these things happen, I was upset but there are worse things that could happen to a person than receiving a broken TV. Anyhow where I really got upset was with how Amazon handled the situation initially when I called. I called at around 6:50 pm and was put on hold 2 times before finally being transferred to the \"Large Item Team\". Well after a few clicks I was disconnected and had to call back. This time I was put on hold several times from 7:06 pm until 7:46 while the representative tried to find an available \"Lead\". She kept coming back on the line to tell me there were no Leads available and that I should call back tomorrow or they would call me back tomorrow if I wished. I told her I wanted to speak with a Lead tonight and not tomorrow. I eventually was disconnected again and had to call back.The third time I was fortunate enough to get a very helpful young lady who listened to what had happened and apologized profusely. She told me she had no idea why the previous associate couldn't find me a Lead and got me one herself in about 30 seconds. The Lead was very helpful and understanding and gave me the number to the Large Item Team and told me when I called them in the morning they would already have notes on everything that happened and they would take care of it.I called this morning (Dec 1) and spoke with a very helpful associate on the Large Item Team and she told me they were going to do everything they could to expedite the replacement TV and that I should expect it in a week or hopefully less. They even gave me a $30 credit on my next purchase which was nice but really I just want my TV and not a broken one.At this point Amazon has been good on making this right but I don't think I'll order large electronic or fragile items from them again. There are some purchases where it is advantageous  to buy local and I think this may be one of those.I look forward to having a working TV next week or sooner and when I do I hope I am able to write a wonderful review for what I believe is a wonderful product. Stay tuned.UPDATE: December 7th 2011Fortunately I have a good sense of humor and believe its been needed with this circus that this TV order has turned into. I have been on the phone with the \"local\" shipper who as of today had no idea where my tv was even though Pilot Freight (who is the shipper) told me to contact them. I was on with Pilot Freight numerous times and the best they could do was tell me the TV was \"somewhere in Arizona\". I asked if maybe they could narrow that down and they said no, Arizona is a pretty large state by the way. It was supposed to be delivered tomorrow (Dec 8) but since no one, including Amazon, knows where it is, I am not holding my breath. The local delivery guys who don't even have the TV said they'll call tomorrow if they get it in their possesion. Unfortunately they don't normally schedule deliveries the same day they receive the product. And oh yeah they only deliver on Thursdays and Tuesdays so the earliest I may see it (if its even found) is next Tuesday. That will put me at one month from when I ordered this thing.But heres the real shocker, the local delivery guys told me that the company who was supposed to be bringing the item to them (another hand in the shipping chain) is notorious for delivering destroyed merchandise, ESPECIALLY tv's. These are people who are part of the Amazon shipping chain telling me that other parts of the shipping chain that they deal with daily have a reputation for routinely delivering damaged or destroyed items. I even let Amazon know that I, as an Amazon customer, was told this not once but twice by their own contracted shippers.Needless to say I have no hope the TV will be delivered tomorrow and now am expecting next Tuesday at the earliest. On top of that I am almost expecting it to be destroyed in shipping again.Bottom line I will NEVER order a big ticket or physically large delicate item from Amazon again. I told Amazon I would have been more than willing to pay for a reputable shipper to deliver the TV to me. One that has actual tracking and can deliver in less than 2 weeks. They say that is not an option. Well for as great as Amazon is this is one huge flaw. My suggestion to Amazon is to at least give people an option. If people want free shipping then great let them deal with this mess. Otherwise let people pick the shipper of their choice and pay whatever the shipping costs may be.This has been a nightmare experience and I didn't even tell you about the shippers who showed up at my door yesterday stating they were there to take the defective tv even though Amazon told me the guys who bring the new tv will take the old tv at the same time. I verified with Amazon that the guys who were there yesterday were legitimate but that it was a mistake for them to be there to pick up the defective TV. WOW, is this Candid Camera or what?I will update if and when I get this tv. Of course by the time I get this thing the technology will be outdated and I will just go buy the latest and greatest at Best Buy like I now know I should have done in the first place.UPDATE: December 8thAt around 2:00 the TV shows up. I'm surprised there is only a driver and no assistant. Amazon promised me I was getting the \"white glove treatment\" so I was curious to see how this was going to go. So I go outside and I say hi to the guy and ask where his partner is. He says \"partner?, I ain't got no partner, thats too much pay\". Seriously I'm not kidding. So anyhow he looks at me then the TV in the back of the truck and I get the hint that he needs me to help him unload it. We get it to the ground off the back of a 4'+ bed and he puts it on dolly and brings it up to the front door. I then lift my end and we take it into the house and place it in the living room. I tell him Amazon told me they promised me the delivery guys (him) would unbox, hook it up and verify it was in good working order and then take all the packaging with them when they left. He laughs, I mean literally laughs and says \"I don't know why they told you that, I don't do that\". So I tell him that is not what I was promised but that I would do it all but needed to verify it was working and not damaged before he left. So I start to unbox it and he looks at his watch and says \"listen buddy I have to go, I can't wait for you to test your tv, they normally tell me if I'm supposed to stay and its not on my work order.\" Then I remind him the original defective TV needs to be picked up and he tells me thats not on his work order either. I explain Amazon told me they would pick up the old TV when they delivered the new. He says \"sorry, not on my work order and he just leaves out the front door and doesn't even close it. I kid you not. So I call Amazon and tell them what just happened and of course they are very apologetic and explain I was supposed to get the white glove treatment and he absolutely was supposed to take the old TV. They called Pilot and I got a call back from Pilot apologizing for the local driver and that they were embarrassed and would file a complaint against the local shipper.The good news is that the TV is simply amazing. Breathtaking is the best way I can describe it. I have never in my life seen a more beautiful picture. I will need to play with it for a week or so before I can give a full review but out of the box all I can say is that this is probably the best electronic purchase I have made in my life. I keep going back and turning it on just to be amazed again and again. Its that good. And oh yeah the 3D is incredible, both 3D blu ray and DirectTv broadcast were unbelievable.

Most of the reviews for this tv were good, and although I noticed that customers continually reiterated the fluctuation brightness issue, I did not see this as a warning sign since many of these reviews were from last year or the year before. This was a horrible mistake.Within hours of arriving, my tv started acting up and showing the tell-tale brightness fade. So I looked deeper into the issue online and saw that it could be fixed by an A-board replacement, which seemed to only take 20 minutes and should be free since I just purchased the tv.Mistake number two was calling Panasonic about the issue. The guy on the other end of the phone lied to me about my tv being a \"lemon\" even after I confronted him with the known issue and told him that since my TV was produced in November of 2011, this should not still be an issue. I told him I read the reviews, and that I only wanted an A-board replacement since it would be difficult to return the tv. He recommended I replace the tv through Amazon as I was still under the return warranty, and surely the unit I got was just faulty. I foolishly returned the tv. Amazon was awesome, and sent me a replacement for free. I just received the replacement hours ago, and again the product is acting up. I am returning this tv, getting another brand, and never buying panasonic again. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TV. Until they fix the brightness issue, this is like throwing cash down the drain.

I updated the firmware to the latest version via the included wifi (wireless N 5GHz!!!!) and have experimented with Viera connect.  meh.I already went into the settings to tweak the picture...turned off the C.A.T.S. feature which is most likely cause of the 'fluctuating brightness' issue that others complain about.  I can tell you that my tv does not do that.  Only use the THX setting in a very dark room.  I actually think I should've purchased the ST model instead of the GT model.Lastly, for those who are hoping for the newest models possible, I originally purchased my 55 GT after Black Friday (late November) and received a tv that has a July 2011 manufacturing date.

I chose to go with a plasma HDTV because I figured I was used to better black levels and contrast ratios from the DLP.  I have not been disappointed by this Panasonic.  The picture quality is astounding.  There are several more picture adjustment options than what I previously had, and I have been able to find some good starting calibration settings from cnet.  I also really like THX mode.  In addition to having it's own set of picture settings, it turns off certain features like motion smoothing, pixel orbiter, etc. that will alter the intended image, and it's a fairly quick option to select.I suppose it may be due to plasma technology, but it's a heavier TV than I expected (although I suppose I saw the weight listed and never paid attention).  It's also a very thin TV especially for a plasma.  I've heard Panasonic hasn't been known for stylish looking TV's, but they've definitely got a nice look for this one.One thing I feel I have to note is that the brightness fluctuation problem appears to be fixed.  I have not noticed any fluctuating brightness or floating blacks.  Maybe my eyes aren't as sensitive as other reviewers, but I'm not complaining.  I haven't watched the Dark Knight on it yet (I've read that movie really suffers from fluctuating brightness), so I'm hoping I won't need to update my review after that.I was looking forward to getting a TV that properly handled 24p input such as Blu-Ray.  This TV has a 48 Hz setting that is to be used for 24p inputs.  Just like other reviews have mentioned, this setting causes a fairly annoying flickering effect kind of like watching a movie on an old film projector.  I watched most of Avatar using the 48 Hz setting, and what I found was that medium dark to dark scenes and those with a lot of motion tended to hide the flickering.  It's mostly noticeable in brightly lit scenes especially those such as bright skies or rooms where most of the scene is the same color.  The VT30 series has a 96 Hz setting which I've read does not show the flickering, so if you're willing to spend a few hundred dollars more for proper 24p handling, that would probably be a good choice.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "audio  picture  jumping", "Author": "tubbed out", "ReviewID": "R2MP3H5L6AIQCL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "What i don,t like about this tv 60\"  is it only has digital audio out  none in, so i hadto buy a digital to analog audio box, for $80.00 Just to use my bose system 1999  It would of been just that easy to add analog audio in jack,  Also i have picture jumping at top of screen, And it does put out a lot of heat.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just bought off Amazon and it's lovely.", "Author": "Arthur Mills", "ReviewID": "R3F3YBI27SPGFD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having struggled for some time to pull the trigger on a replacement television for my 11-year-old Pioneer Elite, I finally did so with this monster.

I was somewhat surprised to see the rating was only 3.5 stars, but am confident that it will even out over time to be in line with the other models in this series of TV.That being said there are some flaws as mentioned in previous reviews.- There is a buzzing sound, this however depends on the settings of the TV. If the contrast is cranked very high you will notice it more. After calibrating the TV and turning down the contrast its not noticeable. (This is a common problem with Plasma TVs and not specific to this model). I sit about 11 feet away from the TV for reference.- There are fluctuating blacks at times. This is very much dependent on the content. I have not noticed them nearly as often when in THX or a mode with similar calibration settings. Perhaps I got a set that is less affected by this, but if it was as big a problem as some would suggest I would have sent the TV right back. Or maybe I simply got used to it, so take this for what its worth and make your own decision. I would recommend finding a store that stocks the TV and get a look at it yourself.The things that I liked:+ Picture quality is fantastic+ Great modern exterior design. I had originally purchased a ST30 and exchanged for this model and the difference is night and day.+ Compared to the ST30, the Wi-Fi dongle is hidden along the back of the TV. On the P46ST30 model it protrudes out the side of the TV.+ 3D looks great, I got the Avatar 3-D bundle with purchase and am not disappointed. I don't know how much I will use it in the future, but I thought it looked great.In summary, not a perfect set, but among the best I've seen.

The settings for vivid was ok, but the THX, custom, and standard was horrid.  The THX setting, from all of my research, was suppose to be the best out of the box.  I thought THX mode was to be very close as possible to reproducing the HD Color Standard used by filmmakers in the studio.  Unless filmmaker wanted me to see a dark, dingy, sun burnt skin tones, then they succeeded.  Is it also possible to see motion blur/judder in 1080i/p on Plasmas?

I was set on a Samsung, but after reading some of the problems, on AVS forums and Highdefjunkies, I decided to look at Panasonic more closely. I read all about the Plasma burn in, the buzzing, the fluctuating brightness, and worried some more. I was set on a plasma, but was a little intimidated by all the issues.When Amazon had a sudden price drop on a model I had been researching and that HDJ, had said was a good one, (with a build date after June 2011) I decided to go for it.It was supposed to arrive in 10 days, so I made plans to get help to move furniture, and our old monster rear projection TV, out the day before arrival. Well I got a call several days early informing us that the TV was already here and since we weren't prepared, it had to wait for us. We set aside time for delivery on the date it was supposed to arrive, and we got the TV and furniture moved and ready. The delivery guy was a little late, but he called to explain and was very nice about it. It was pouring down rain when he arrived and he had to park at the end of our long drive way because his truck wouldn't make it past our apple tree. He used his dolly and got it to the steps and carried it the rest of the way. What a load for one medium sized man. He did swell. He unboxed it, made sure everything was there that should have been, and turned it on and made sure it was undamaged and worked. He got a signal. That was it. My husband put the stand together and he and I put it on top of our cabinet. It was heavy for me. We neither one are as young as we used to be, so we could have used my sons help.Well, I'd heard you have to run colored slides, to set the plasma cells, so I borrowed a thumb drive from my granddaughter and used my grandson's computer to download them and get them going. It was easy enough getting it to work, and we were off and running. My husband is a TV junkie and no way would I get him to wait four days to watch TV, so during the day, and evenings, we watched regular HD TV, but we always made sure it was full screen, using one of the settings. Sometimes we had to use the zoom, but it wasn't bad. Not quite as clear as regular HD, but better than standard TV.  It does sometimes cut off the tops of their heads though. Then I'd run the slides all night and part of the following day.I set the contrast and color below 50 and the brightness at about 65. I used the THX mode and it's still like that after having 350+ hours on it. We still watch it as above and run the slides occasionally, especially if we watch several hours of DVD movies with black bars top and bottom. I check every night when the slides are going, and don't see any black areas, no stripes, or logos, or whatever they claim, that is supposed to be causing burn in problems. I did think we had some fluctuating brightness and got to worrying that we might have to download a software update. I checked and this was a June 2011 build, and there was a newer update, but it said not to download it unless you had problems. We haven't seen any fluctuating brightness so far, unless it's slipped by me.I set up the internet and it found my router, but I haven't used it yet. We have a whole wall of DVD movies, and most of them play real good in our new Panasonic Blueray DVD player Panasonic DMP-BDT220 Integrated Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player. We got a new Yamaha receiver to hook up all the stuff to, and with all three of these new gadgets, they have kept me going around in circles, figuring how to hook them up and which remote does what. We also added a subwoofer Polk Audio PSW110 10-Inch Powered Subwoofer (Single, Black)  to our system, and it blew out our surround speakers, so I have to find a replacement for them. Guess we have the base set too low.As of today, it's been 3 weeks since we fired it up, and I am pleased as punch with it. I'm sure we could use a professional calibrator, but DVD movies, and most HD TV shows we watch on CBS and NBC, and HBO etc., are really good. The color is pretty good right out of the box, on THX, I haven't even tried anything else. I hear no buzzing at all, except on NBC, which had buzzing with our old set, bad transmission I guess, and FOX channel is a little dark, but they are always dark. No fluctuating brightness, unless we just aren't aware of it, but I'm sure I would have noticed. My husband doesn't see anything, but I'm pretty picky. We are going to be very watchful for the next month or two, then it says after 900 hours or so, you can't hardly cause burn in no matter what, so I'm mindful of that.It's been fifteen years since we bought our last home theater stuff, and even though it all still worked, we figured it was time to upgrade.

The second was the Panasonic 55\" GT30 plasma.In the years gone back, Plasma tvs were given a bad rap, but the picture quality has always been great.So, what convinced me to get the Panasonic was the THX certification.  It is only available on this model.  I had read the early reviews of this model that had the image flicker and was hesitant to purchase the Panasonic.  Then I read the the later production run (Nov 2011) had solved this issue.Also, one of the other reason, was the price.  the Sony XBR though a great TV was $2900 bucks.

Shortly after my purchase I noticed fluctuating brightness issues with the television. At first, this appeared to be isolated to one network so I figured it was an issue with the broadcast. Over time (and beyond the 30 day return window), I began to realize the issue was pervasive and appeared to be an issue with the television itself rather than the broadcast. Over the past 45 days I have worked extensively with Panasonic on this issue. We have had several (~ 6-7) phone calls and a on-site visit to fix the issue, but not solution has been found. I'm very disappointed with Panasonic's customer service and technical support, but that's not the focus of this review.I'm very frustrated with Amazon's approach towards my issues with this product. I purchased this product from Amazon, not Panasonic, and as a consumer, I expect the retailer to assume responsibility for selling a defective product. The first representative that I spoke to on the phone acknowledged that this is a defective product and she agreed to transfer me to an agent to issue a refund and arrange a pick up of the tv. When I reached the second agent, she repeated over and over that the return window (30 days) had expired. She did agree that it is a defective product, but that I should contact the manufacturer. I reminded her that I've been working with the manufacturer who has not been able to find a solution after several phone calls and a visit to my home. Her supervisor, Betsy J, was equally disappointing and stated that the first representative should not have offered me a refund. Instead, Betsy J made an attempt at bribing me to go away. \"Would a $75 credit towards a future purchase be satisfactory?\" No, Betsy, I want a refund for the $1,600 defective television set you sold to me that the manufacturer has acknowledged does not work as expected.I strongly suggest you reconsider purchasing electronics, especially large dollar purchases, from Amazon. Clearly, from my phone conversations this morning, Amazon does not have a spine and is unwilling to stand up for dissatisfied customers. A customer service focused organization would acknowledge they are selling defective television sets and assume the responsibility for asking the manufacturer for a refund. I have had much more success working with Best Buy and other independent retailers when it comes to customer service issues.

Product showed up on time and in good condition with adequate packaging.  The picture is amazing, and one thing I like is that these TVs do not have that 'fake' picture look to them like some of the new LEDs.  Sound quality is adequate for cable television, but you need surround sound to appreciate the full effect with movies.My warning is with the screen.  We had a 42\" previous version of this TV that survived all sorts of abuse.  However, this unit cracked the plasma inside the glass screen on the first hit by a light plastic toy.  This was certainly our fault, but when we submitted to Panasonic they were unwilling to help in any way outside of warranty claims.  Since this was not covered by warranty, our only option was local Panasonic Service Centers.  We spoke with two in our area, and their price for a new plasma screen (without any mark up or labor for install) was actually higher than our new TV from Amazon.  Panasonic has repairs priced higher than new TVs and they do not provide any swap/refurbish options.  This was very disappointing.I now have a beautiful TV that will not turn on because there is a fail-safe feature in the unit that does not allow power to the screen if it is cracked.  It costs more to repair the TV so I might as well throw the whole thing in the dumpster.I still use and love my 42\" Viera.

All my A/V equipment was Sony.A while ago, I had a very large WEGA Trinitron TV that lasted for over 10 years, in fact it was still fine when I replaced it for an HD flat screen, Sony (of course) Bravia 52XBR9, wonderful picture and features.13 months after purchase it got sick! Power-on lit up the righthand side of the screen but the lefthand side \"spluttered\"  darkly, but finally lit up the rest of the screen.A call to Crutchfield yielded a few ideas to try, but they were not in a position to do much else apart from recommend calling Sony.Sony's response was, of course, \"warranty is 12 months, we can arrange 'a visit' but you will have to $$$$\"So much for brand loyalty!The \"spluttering\" was originally for 5 -10 minutes but over time it became 20-30 and finally last week it spluttered it's last.In short, I leased a 52\" TV from Sony for $75 per month and am now responsible for disposing of said TV (one does not tuck a 52\" TV under one's arm and toddle off to the electronic waste disposal center)Not a happy camper.However, like any good junkie, I went to Crutchfield and Amazon and checked out the Sony XBR's.Discovered some nice looking ones but at close to $3000 was hesitant, especially after reading tales of \"folds\" in the screen and Sony being unresponsive to fixing the problems.My other drug of choice is: any product from Apple, so why not broaden my addiction horizons even further?I have always had a yen to try a plasma TV so I visited the plasma TV world on the internet.Learned of the deities Pioneer KURO and Panasonic VT30 and the world of true black and other spells and potions, burn in, torching, etc.My 27\" iMac screen (truly a beautiful V-HD picture) is made by LG so I started with them, progressed to Samsung and eventually to Panasonic (after all they make the god VT30).Getting a VT30 in 50\" or 55\" was not offered by my chosen vendors. Reviews all said the GT30 was not as good as the VT30 but close. So sold stock and visited my dealer and purchased a TC-P55GT30 3/13/21012.Aware that models manufactured prior to August 2011 had one of the 'dreaded problems' had fingers crossed mine would not be a remnant in one of Amazon's wharehouses and be affected and need a \"visit\"Fortunately, the unit delivered was manufactured December 2011. So far so good.My system:Apple Airport Extreme Base Station, Mac mini server (HDMI), 27\" iMac, 2-2TB external Iomega FW hard drives (1- Media storage, 1- Media storage backup), 1-1TB external Iomega FW hard drive (Time machine backup of iMac's 1TB internal hard drive)Both machines running Lion, soon to be Mountain Lion (the gift that keeps giving! The Greeks give the boatman two coins, we give the AppStore $29.95 ad nauseam)MacMini has Plex server installed, both machines have Plex clients installed.MM connected to Sony A/V unit via jumbo HDMI cables from Monoprice (fat shielded cables with very low signal loss and inexpensive)iMac has Thunderport to HDMI adapter plugged in. Able to switch fat cable from MM to iMac ( haven't thought of a good reason to do that yet! but adapter was only $7)Comcast Cable HD DVR, Monoprice HDMI to A/V box.Sony Bluray player, Monoprice HDMI to A/V boxA/V box to TV, Monoprice HDMI cable.These connections now revised, see later.Routing is important with these fat cables, they do not bend easily, break-out cables or angled HDMI connectors save screwing up the equipment HDMI connectors.All devices Cat 6 connected to AEBS (surprisingly they all get along well)Essentially, my TV is just a monitor.The cable company coax cable splits to the TV as well as to the DVR for use when I am recording two things on the DVR and wish to watch a third program I can switch to the TV tuner.Plex plays all my burned DVDs, all my video files, music files and picture files. It also streams my Netflix queue and any other computer stuff.A lot of the really good stuff for Macs is free or donation requested. I try stuff and if it really does what it says and I continue to use it I will always make a donation. If we don't do this, the good stuff goes to the biggies and they charge an arm and a leg, especially if it says Mac on the tin!Obviously, I can also use the plasma as a large monitor for the Mac Mini in 'computer' mode. I have separate bluetooth keyboard and trackpad for controlling the MM from the 'TV chair' Neat adapter from Henge Docks called Clique allows both units to be mounted together in a solid base for laptop use.At the 'computer chair' I can control the MM from the iMac share screen function and use the iMac keyboard and trackball to control both machines.This all makes the TV's bells and whistles superfluous, but a nice to have backup.If I could find a decent App that controls any A/V device one could throw at it; intuitively, the purchase of an iPad could be justified (well! a $500 universal remote justifiable.... may be)Panasonic TV:Unit arrived 3 days after ordering, CEVA carrier, two guys very pleasant and efficient, delivered, removed TV from box, assembled stand and lifted unit into place on my entertainment unit.They placed all the packaging in the box and left it with me. Apparently, they are supposed to take the box away with them.Should the TV develop a problem needing return and/or replacement having the box would make more sense. So I preferred that they did leave it.Having turned the unit on I was extremely un-impressed with the picture, especially in comparison with my Sony on it's good days.After doing the full installation setup I tried all the setting options for picture settings they ranged from ghastly to OK.I have several setups downloaded from various sites.Finally found one that produced a very good picture to my eyes.Started the 200 hour burn in process. I have a DVD, just a series of full screen colors, that cycle for, I think, 14 hours. At night I ran the DVD and during the day I ran a rotating screen saver on my Mac Mini and in the evening watched TV. For the unwatched portion I turned the picture to 'standard' which was very dim so the screen was not subjected to extremely bright contrast settings.My custom setting seems to have matured, over the 200 hours, into an extremely nice picture, at least as good as the Sony.Changed my cable hookups: Fat HDMI from Mac Mini, Blu Ray player and Comcast box. Connected a digital fibre optic cable from the TV to the TV-in on the A/V unit.I can now watch the TV and have sound from the TV, surprisingly good sound from small speakers, or switch to the A/V box and get 5.1 sound or use my headphones. Set the TV Audio to \"through amplifier\" and just turn the TV remote volume down and the A/V remote sound up.Just purchased a pair of XPand universal 3D glasses. Don't have a 3D player so I downloaded some short clips from the Panasonic site, shot with a 3D camera at a Japanese zoo. Loaded them onto an SD card, plugged the card into the TV. 3D looks neat, not terribly excited about it though. 2D to 3D setting on TV next to useless, IMO.I shall probably buy the Panasonic 3D player, some time, and maybe cough-up a donation to Cameron's underwater exploration and watch Titanic in 3D.But in all honesty I don't see what the big fuss is all about...a lousy movie is lousy in 2 or 3 D.Overall pleased with the TV, I appear to have have got an excellent price and a very nice viewing experience.Kudos to Amazon and CEVA", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV....once I can figure it out", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R6558CKZ5MWU0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is is my first flat screen TV.....I've had the same 27 Sony for 15 years.

However, since I have been purchasing a lot of items on Amazon for the holidays I decided to get Amazon Prime.  One reason was because I would have access to Amazon Video.  This TV was suppose to have Amazon Instant Video as well as NetFlix.  Well my unit does not have either Amazon Instant Video or NetFlix.  I spent over an hour and a half with Panasonic yesterday dealing with this.  30 minutes proving to them this TV is suppose to have both of those options (Seriously you are the Manufacture).They finally agree yes this TV should have both and said they need to research this and contact me in 72 hours.  Ok fine.  I get a call today explaining that they do not know why I am missing these two applications and effectively it would be shelved until they have more calls on it to figure it out.  I asked if they were going to replace my TV and he said no because it works.  I explained to them over and over that I paid for a TV that has both NetFlix and Amazon Instant video and neither applications are there so the TV does not work.  Around and around we went with that debate.My options are return the TV to Amazon due to any issue for a Panasonic manufacture issue, deal with not having those applications even though I paid for a device to have them, or call a service tech.  Keep in mind I am told if I call a service tech I will likely have to pay for the service call because the TV  is \" functioning properly\" but only missing 2 applications.

I did want to point out an issue regarding the inability of the media reader to recognize and playback video recorded as 2D - 1080/60 from SD cards.  This may be a very big issue if you have purchased a panasonic camcorder  such as the HDC - TM 90P (like I did) with the anticipation that you could just pop the SD card in the rear reader and watch video with ease.  This camera - like many - gives you a choice of recording the 2D files in either  the 1080/60 mode or a lessor (non-progressive I think)resolution.  Like most people, I recorded in the highest resolution available - only to find out that the reader did not recognize the files.  Ironically, it recognized and played the 3D files (you need camera adapter to record in 3D) and jpeg stills just fine.  I was confused because I was certain the files were still on the card and that the pictures were recorded correctly (I had downloaded them onto a laptop with the Pansonic HD writer software that comes with the camera and could see them on the computer).  In addition, if I put the SD card back in the camera and connected it to the plasma with the HDMI, or put the SD card into a Pansonic Blu Ray DVD player - the TV played back the files perfectly.  Tech support was of no help - when I called the camera number, they said it was a TV issue.  When I called the TV number, they first referred the issue for 'research', never called back, and finally sent an email that said it was because I had downloaded the files with their software (and changed the file prefex/name).  However, I had already told the rep I had the same problem with files on the card even if I never downloaded them and put the SD card directly into the TV immediately after recording them.  [although the idea that if you simply download the files with their own software makes them 'disappear' for the tv is another independent problem I would think].A further complicating thought was that the TV could read and play MOI files from an older Panasonic camcorder directly from the card without issue.  Clearly looks like software issue.  Firware was updated to latest with no improvement.  Finally, I went back to camera tech support and confirmed that the problem was probably just that the TV media reader caannot deal with the 1080/60 files on the SD card. In my ignorance, I thought all the files recorded on the camera were AVCHD - but the camera manual (p.79) says that when the 1080/60 is deselected, THEN the files become AVCHD.  I had counted on the AVCHD compatibility with the TV media reader as an indication that it would playback all the files.  Apparently the progressive 1080/60 files are different. Maybe they are still AVCHD, but they are different to the media reader.  Given that I can see the files using other connections, is this a big deal?  To me, at the very least it is a big deal that no one in the TV tech support seems to know this is an issue.  To me, it is a big deal that tech support sends out email answers that ignore the information I provided.  But these are typical tech support problems.  It maybe a really big deal for people who don't have Blue Ray DVD player connected (although in fairness that is probably not many people).  But what is the really big deal to me is the lack of compatibility between some of the more advanced products from the same company. I purchased a Panasonic 3D plasma (vs. Samsung, etc.) specifically because I thought it offered the simplest way of watching my vacation video (which actually NEVER gets watched unless it is very easy to view)captured on a Panasonic camcorder.  I was assured by the camera tech people (it was purchased first) that the TV's would play everything back.  (Best buy people told me same thing)  In the end, maybe that is the 'biggest' deal: that I tried very hard to make intelligent purchases and still screwed up because the people marketing and supporting the products gave me wrong answers.  If someone had simply told me before I bought the tv/camera: 'hey, there is slight pain the in butt that you will have to use the HDMI cable or DVD connection to see the 1080/60 2D files, but the picture will be great and the 3D stuff will work directly....\" - I probably would have still bought the equipment.  BUT, I would not have wasted hours and hours of phone calls on tech support trying to find out if I had to send my tv back to Amazon.

I purchased a 46\" Panasonic Plasma TV about 2 years ago.  I LOVED it!  It was the best picture and sound I had experienced in a flat panel TV.  I loved it so much, I bought a 32\" Panasonic LCD TV last year for our bedroom.  That one, I didn't love so much.  Picture is not as good and sound is much worse.  But, back to the point of this review.About 3 months ago, the plasma TV started with an issue of the TV not turning on, but the red LED beside the power button flashing 10 times, pause, then repeating, whenever I turned the TV off, then back on within 30 minutes.  If it was off for over 30 minutes, no problem.  As the weeks passed, this got worse, with me having to disconnect the power cord, wait 30 minutes, then try again.  Then it got worse again, with me having to disconnect all cables (power, HDMI, video, etc.), wait 30 minutes and try again.  Finally, this week, nothing will revive it from the dreaded red blinking light.Research shows this is caused by one, or more, of about 5 circuit boards involved in the power management of the TV.  Repairs (of course it is out of warranty) will cost $500-$700.The worse part is, these boards were used on many different models and sizes of Panasonic TVs and this has continued to occur on newer models.  Panasonic should be ashamed of themselves for letting this continue.  Of course, they will do NOTHING for you out of warranty.  Class action lawsuits have been discussed, but as far as I know, none have been initiated.DO NOT BUY A PANASONIC FLAT PANEL TV OF ANY KIND!!!!!!!  You have been warned!  If you do, don't be surprised if it only lasts 18-24 months before you get the red blinking light.Do your research.  You will be convinced!!!!", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic's Rebate for Skype Camera is a Problem", "Author": "Cato", "ReviewID": "R1E9M247U8DV5D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Skype rebate is a problem. After carefully following the endless instructions, we received a  letter from The Advertising Checking Bureau Inc., which seems to administer Panasonic's rebates, requesting a copy of the front page of the tv manual to receive the serial number and UPC code. But we had already sent these: the serial number and upc bar code from the tv box and the Invoice, and more, per rebate instructions in the package. We are disappointed at this request, which spends customers' time unnecessarily. In May, we also sent IDENTICAL information for the Avatar movie  under the dvd rebate and we already received it; while in this case, Panasonic requests more information, which it already has, and who knows if, and when, we will get the Skype camera.

They are essentially the same with minor changes.  I bought mine at Costco.My TV just failed after 8 months service. Blue lines advance down the screen along with the picture.

No doubt it will be down a long time if my experience with electronic repairs is an indicator.This one may have been a lemon, or maybe it says something about Panasonic plasma TV quality. Great picture, but pay your money and take your chances.UPDATE: 1/31/2012I had contacted Panasonic on the problem as soon as it happened. They had a local repair facility call me and I described the problem.  The serviceman was able to determine that it was probably a discrepant main board and had one shipped to him. 6 days after the original call to Panasonic, the serviceman arrived on site and replaced the main circuit board. No charge since it was still in the 12 month warranty period.

I've read the reviews on Panasonic's web-site and they are mostly 5 star glowing reviews; I find it interesting, that my review on their site, hasn't shown up to date.I have owned and purchased HDTV's/equipment over the last 5 years; I still own those products and they still work great. Recently, I decided to take the plunge and purchase a 3D, Plasma TV from PANASONIC; this is when my troubles and stress began. I owned this TV for only a year and (less than) a month, when I heard a \"pop\" and the screen went black; that \"pop\" turned out to be the end of my 3k TV. This in turn began a month-long nightmare with their customer service. The first time I phoned their service department was on 11-12-11, I spoke with a very pleasant rep and explained my issue. She asked when I purchased the TV (over a year ago) and explained that they have a 30 day grace period on their warranty (if I qualified). I provided more information and explained that I still had my receipt and documentation of when it was installed in my home (almost 2 months after the purchase date); she told me I would qualify for this extension and asked that I e-mailed my documentation to \"Team 3\". So as not to be too verbose, I'll summarize my ensuing month long Odyssey as follows; I sent the information requested, I resubmitted the information (they lost it, then found it later), I was forced to phone them back 4 times because they never responded (Nov. 12,14, & 29th, Dec 8), each time I waited no less than a half an hour (the last call was a 48 minute wait). As a result of my frustration during the call on the 29th, I asked to speak with a supervisor, \"Donna\" informed me it would be 24-48 hrs before a call back, which I never received. On Dec 8th I phoned again, my patience now worn thin, asked for a supervisor four times (the rep told me they were not available at that hour, same as before) but, I insisted; he finally acquiesced and passed me on to a supervisor, only to be told I was denied on Dec. 1. I asked why I hadn't been informed or received the requested call from the supervisor prior to my waiting on the phone again, her response I don't know but, you should have been. I asked the for a reason why I was denied, she said my initial phone call to the service department was beyond the warranty date. I asked why the rep didn't just tell me that from the beginning and further, why did I have to go to all the trouble to provide the documentation that I did, when I was told by the first rep I'd be covered. She said they would have to talk to her supe, because she shouldn't have told me I'd be covered as of installation date, it's only purchase date. I surmised that the 1st rep wouldn't have said that, unless she had the authority to do so and on and on.Pursuant to your request Sean, here is the model TC-P54VT25 and I have a detailed log of my vexing experience with Panasonic.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "65-inch LCD display\nFlush Design; Full HD 3D\nInfinite Black 2 Panel\nVIERA Connect Wi-Fi Ready\nThis item is also available for shipping to select countries outside the U.S.", "Name": "Panasonic VIERA TC-P65GT30 65-Inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV (2011 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yO9LOP6kL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004MME75Q"}}
