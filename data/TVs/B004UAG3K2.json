After watching it for about 5 minutes it will shut off and turn itself back on (which takes about 3-4 minutes).  After contacting the customer service department at Funai they say the power supply is failing and I need to take it somewhere to get repaired.  In the manual it says it will provide \"Many Years\" of enjoyable television viewing.  Last time I checked 18 months was not several years.  According to the guy I talked to it is a very common problem with sylvania tv's.  So if you don't want to replace your tv every year or two, I would suggest a different brand.  I did a lot of internet research after contacting them and there are a ton of other people with the same issue and experts saying to stay away from sylvania.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheaper at BJs but worth every penny.", "Author": "Nicole", "ReviewID": "R2BP4B33TPKJB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hubby and I bought this as a compulsive buy at BJs for a little over $200.

It has two HDMI inputs, a PC-IN RGB, USB, audio out, and all the stuff to hook up a gaming station. I've had it plugged into my wii and my computer nonstop. I was going use speakers with it, but the built in speakers are so great it wasn't worth it. My roommates cat would sometimes try and claw up the screen chasing after the wii-mote pointer, but the screen is so durable it didn't even scratch! The screen is also great for watching TV during the day, there isn't much of a glare. I've moved with this TV twice and it's still in great condition. I literally have no complaints. The only thing it does sometimes is that it does not properly detect the right format, but all you have to do is go through the formats (there is a format button on the remote so it's pretty simply) and reset it.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "sound, no picture", "Author": "kelly", "ReviewID": "RVXNR04FKKLRQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV was great for about 15 months, then the screen went blank.  I did not think to call Sylvania since I did not buy a warranty package from Target.  We had no Sylvania repairmen in the area so I took the back off and looked for an obvious problem.  There were two basic board on the back, so I thought how hard could it be...long story short I got the two boards from ShopJimmy.com and there still was no change in the picture(black with colored vertical lines). I called Shop Jimmy's tech support and they figured that it was the picture panel/board...they do not supply the part.  I called Sylvania and since I touched my TV they do not honor the warranty(if I had one)...and were no help at all.

I purchased this TV from KMART in March 2012. It had a great clear picture and a great price. In June 2012, about 2 weeks after the 3 month labor warranty, the sound started going out after the TV was running. I had to either change the channels several times or turn it off and then back on for the sound to come back on again. Then after running for awhile it would turn off again. I had purchased a Kmart service agreement but that did not kick in until after the manufacturer's parts warranty of 1 year. Problem with the manufacturers warranty is the cost of labor is only covered for 3 months and after that it's $70.00 an hour.Working with the manufacturer Funai Service for this TV was a horrible experience. The first time I called the man I spoke to almost sounded gleeful that I would have to pay $70.00 an hour labor. They did finally cover the cost of labor and they did cover the cost of shipping the TV back and forth 3 times with the same problem occurring over again, but waiting on the phone, dealing with different service people who didn't have the service history records up to date was a nightmare. Kmart has helped me deal this the manufacturer which has been a bonus, and stated they would refund me the purchase price if I did not get any satisfaction from the manufacturer.I finally got Funai to agree to a refund in October 2012. I sent in a copy of my receipt via email. A week later I heard nothing so I called again and they stated they never received the email. I sent it again to a different email address and heard nothing again. I decided to wait a bit because they said the refund would take 8-10 weeks.Today, 3 months later, January 2013 still no refund and no phone call and no email, I decide to call again. After waiting on the phone for quite awhile the women I was speaking to said they would find my emails with the copies of the receipt and issue me a refund, which had not been issued previously as promised. So hear I am 10 months later still dealing with this mess.Don't buy this TV or any other TV manufactured by Sylvania. I am 63 and never, ever, ever had such a problem with a service center or a TV. It was my first and last purchase of a Sylvania product.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY Sylvania", "Author": "Natalie Aching", "ReviewID": "R1RO6UUL5ATJMU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item has power issues and will only last 13 monthsYou pay for what you get, so buy the extended warranty if you need to get this TVCustomer service is a joke and I am totally upset with this purchase.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sylvania 32\" TV is Garbage", "Author": "Trini Lady \"island gyul\"", "ReviewID": "R2A5HTHZXFV7PQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a new TV end of April 2011 for a good price and 3 months later it quit working right. It would turn itself off and on and then it wouldn't do either. I called the company for a replacement because it was within the 90 days warranty. The replacement was used--I was not happy--but accepted it because they assured me that it is guaranteed to work. That quit working almost immediately so they sent me a new TV. Now barely 10 months later, that one is doing the same nonsense as the others. I purchased one for my daughter at the same time last year and hers finally messed up and now she has to pay a labor charge for it to be fixed. I will NEVER buy Sylvania again.

We took it back the next day and the electronics guy said that it had probably been dropped on arrival. He swapped it for a new one, and this one works wonderful! It has a great picture and lots of settings to customize it how you want it. It is very sleek and nice looking. I love our TV!
