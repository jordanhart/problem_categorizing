Hitachi is first rate with its consumer electronic products and I also own a Hitachi LCD Camcorder.  This TV rocks!  The picture and sound quality are amazing and after watching television on an old regular flat screen non LCD HD Television, it is a feast for the senses.  The setup was a breeze and I could not be happier with my purchase.
