{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So smart that it's 'almost' like an All-in-One PC rather than a HDTV", "Author": "Techie", "ReviewID": "R12DSL7VM8P87W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I start, I apologize for the long review, but I was taking notes for weeks, and even if I left some stuff out, this writeup is more like a short story than a review. I hope some of you find it helpful. By now most of us are familiar with what a Smart LED TV is, so I won't repeat it, however, it's worth mentioning that the LG 60LB7100 comes with the newest IPS (In-plane switching) display technology, which essentially means that it displays a superior picture quality, in clear colors at a full HD 1080p resolution from all viewing angles. All of this while using 30% less of energy than a standard HDTV.Anybody who has a minimum of Cyber-life interaction heard the teasing `Upload pictures or it didn't happen' and it's how I feel at the moment of writing this review. There are so many who have had a bad experience with this same TV model, while I experienced exactly the opposite. The LG 60LB7100 I received worked greatly out of the box and after a few weeks of using it, I have nothing to complain about it.So, I'll be uploading more than a dozen of pictures to the product gallery of the LG 60LB7100, because a picture can tell a lot. I would like you to see this Smart TV performance, well, as good as it can be perceived through pictures. At least, the pictures will showcase how the different screens and how some features work. Also, the IPS feature is shown, because regardless from which angle I took the shot, it resulted in a clear image. My pictures aren't professional ones, or planned, I took them as I saw one thing that might be interesting to remark in this review or just to show a feature I found refreshing. I'll be concentrating in those features I use the most, or that I think should have been explained in detail, or that so far, other reviewers hadn't covered yet.The LG 60LB7100 comes with an embedded version of WebOS, a Linux kernel-based operating system formerly developed and owned by Palm and Hewlett-Packard, (the same OS HP used on their discontinued Tablets). And that is licensed by LG Electronics for used on Smarts TVs.I like the LG WebOS because of the multitasking interface. One can have the browser open with a website, and a few tabs, and switch to Live TV to watch the news, or pause a movie being watched to go and check one's email on the browser. All those screens stay available in the SmartHome menu, and one can go back and forth without having to start all over, like with other Smart TVs. Essentially, a few apps can be open simultaneously and be switched in between as wanted. I also love the fact of how easily I can use a mouse and a keyboard instead of the included remote control. I'll explain more about it later, when I'll detail a few tips about the Magic Remote.The user's manuals that come with the LG 60LB7100 and the one I was able to download from the manufacturer's website are helpful, but limited as if they were a work in progress. So, there are a few functions that require extra explanation. For example, the LG 60LB7100 remote control, Magic Remote. I could write a whole review about it, indeed, a good part of this review is dedicated to it.Next, I list a few random items that could be important in the long run:In the same bag the users' manuals come in, you will find a small antistatic bag with what it looks like a sticker. The sticker inside the antistatic bag  it's an NFC chip, or the LG Tag On, and even if you don't have an  NFC capable device right now, you might want to keep this Tag On where you can find it in the future. This LG Tag On it's the link between the LG 60LB7100 and any device that uses Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.  Essentially, one can network the LG 60LB7100 with any NFC enabled mobile gadgets without using a router. Depending of the app using the NFC technology, Wi-Fi Direct or Bluetooth will be used to transfer data among the devices. The Wi-Fi card inside the LG 60LB7100 is capable of both, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (imagine a communication card similar to that of a laptop).The LG Tag On has its own Android free app (LG TV Tag On app) available at the Google Play Store,  among others LG apps, but none it's in working condition as I write this review. If I get them to work later, I'll come back and edit this to inform everyone how it goes. Note that the Tag On sticker should not be attached to a metal surface. So, where am I supposed to put the thing, because the back of the LG is all metal? At the end, I settled for sticking it on the right bottom corner of the screen.Since I have a router, and I can connect my LG Smartphone into one of the USB ports in the back of the LG 60LB7100 to share any files, the lack of NFC Tag On function is something I won't complain about.Speaking of which, the USB ports embedded in the LG 60LB7100 don't provide more than 5 Volts, so if you want to connect an external hard drive or a tablet that uses more energy, you should keep in mind that it won't charge the tablet as fast, and it won't recognize the hard drive at all. Even if it looks as if it has powered it up. Using an external hard drive with its own power source would work, of course.The portable hard drive issue can also be solved by connecting said hard drive into a router in your home network, and using the SmartShare (DLNA server) feature of the LG 60LB7100 to access the content of the drive.It does recognize external hard drives which use less than 5 Volts and of course, USB Flash drives, or USB Flash cards readers. The file format should be FAT 32 or NTFS. And it reads the most common multimedia file formats.The LG Apps Store wasn't available when I received the LG 60LB7100, (the LG App Store link when I clicked it said 'Coming Soon'). Later, I found out it was going to be launched in a few days and that there would be an update of the LG WebOS too. I decided to wait before writing this review, and simply started taking notes and pictures of the Smart TV before the upgrade. So, you will see pictures of after and before it.Even without the update, the TV was fully functional and the apps that were included at the time of shipping were good to satisfy most customers in the interim. The apps preinstalled are a browser, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video, Vudu, and YouTube.The LG App Store is working now. If you want to see the apps available at the LG Apps Store, you can check them out by doing an online search of the words `us.lgappstv' I don't post the direct link inside the review because last time I checked outside links were not allowed here. The apps are mostly the same available for other Smart TV, however, I noticed that the LG Apps Store seems to have many more.The changes the upgrade does are mainly on the LG WebOS graphical user interface, and I noticed a faster and steadier response from the Magic Remote. The Joystick button panel works better too. Before the upgrade it worked well, but it didn't have a visual menu to guide the joystick functions. After upgrading to the new version, when one pushes the power button it does display a menu with options that can be accessed with it.The Wi-Fi worked with the LG 60LB7100 from the start, and it was useful when I first turned it up before I decided in which room of the house it was going to be set. However, for true fast and steady video streaming one needs a wire. Yes, my router is capable of Dual Band Performance - Up to 300Mbps (2.4GHz) + 867Mbps (5GHz), the manufacturer of it brags about much more, but those are the speeds I witnessed. I still think that wireless doesn't  beat the consistency or the speed of a Gigabit Ethernet connection. Besides, it's easier to use the server feature integrated into the LG 60LB7100 with one.My child uses a lot the DLNA server, which can be accessed on the SmartHome screen menu as SmartShare. I had copied our digital collection into two external hard drives that are connected into our home network, which is run by a WD My Net AC1300 HD Dual Band Router Wireless AC WiFi Router Accelerate HDFor the LG 60LB7100 accessing the content inside the drives, is simpler this way. What does our digital collection include? Well, imagine all those DVD bought during years, our home videos, pictures, mp3 files, etc.  So, rather than buying new content, she often watches content I paid for years ago. I'm lucky in the sense she still finds it entertaining. I do buy new stuff, but less often of what I used to do in the past. Times had changed money-wise.Truth to be told, it's easier to watch again a movie that it's a click away, than to go into a cabinet and look among hundreds of discs. Also, when I was using DVD players, she would switch discs while eating potatoes chips, or peanut butter jelly sandwiches without washing her hands. DVD discs can be washed with soap and water, but the laser head that reads the disc inside the player, no. Besides, she would replay the same part over and over again for hours, which would heat the player (circuits and heat don't mix) and eventually shorten its life. So, my main reason for going digital was to avoid spending money on DVD players and wasting time cleaning the player's laser lens.One doesn't need a router to connect an external hard drive to the LG 60LB7100, as I explained above. It's great to be able to just connect a drive with the content to one of the USB ports embedded in the Smart TV. I rescued an old external hard drive and reformatted it FAT 32 and copied some of her favorite videos to see if she manages to play them as easily as she has done with our other HDTV, and she did it as easier as with the content from the router too. Indeed, it's hard to distinguish what content it's on an external hard drive connected via a USB port, or what comes from the drives connected into the router and shared via the network; when everything is listed on the SmartShare screen. And of course, there are apps in the LG 60LB7100 to watch a lot of online content too.The remote control that comes with the LG 60LB7100. (It's already the standard for LG Smart TVs). It's called Magic Remote. It's like a hybrid between a wireless mouse and a remote control. It's very sensitive, but the Magic Remote I recieved wasn't paired with the TV. All I got was a giant image of the Magic Remote blinking in the middle of the screen and suggesting that I register (pair) the Magic Remote with the LG 60LB7100. I followed the instructions but they didn't work, so I guessed that resetting it was in order. If for some reason doesn't work at first, you need to know what to do. It took me a few minutes to guess it and it was very frustrating.It worked to de-register the Magic Remote before trying to register it. In order to do so, according to the user's manual, press the (return symbol button) and SmartHome buttons at the same time, for five seconds, to unpair the Magic Remote with the LG 60LB7100. Pressing and holding the Live TV (Exit To Live) button will let you cancel and re-register Magic Remote at once. The suggested way to pair it without unpair it, it's to Press the Wheel or turning the TV off and back on. The later only worked for me after I unpair it. The good news is that if has been working well ever since.And when the Magic Remote goes into hibernation, the user's manual says to wave your hand to wake it, in my experience the easier and faster way to wake up the Magic Remote from within any screen, it's just to roll the middle button (which looks like a mouse wheel) a little and the Magic Remote will be active in a nanosecond. Pressing any other button will wake it up too, but with the difference that it will also activate the native function of the other button, for example, if I'm setting the Wi-Fi and the Magic Remote goes to sleep, and I press the home button, I will end up in the SmartHome menu, and I don't want that, because while most screens stay inactive in the background and could become active with a click of the Magic Remote, the Setting screen simply disappears and one must start all over again. So, scroll wheels forever, or as long as the lifespan of the Magic Remote allows it.Oh, before I forgot. If your beloved Magic Remote dies or the kids do something evil to it, (like it usually happens at my house). Don't panic and don't fear the high fee you might have to pay for getting a replacement, it can be replaced with a wireless mouse. Yes, the best way to deal with this Smart TV is interacting with it as if it were a computer (because it's sort of a huge All-in-One). Of course, if by the time of the Magic Remote's demise, you're in love with the thing, feel free to order a replacement.I know that I won't. As cute as the little hybrid thing is, it won't be missed. I don't have any problems using the Joystick button to turn the TV on and off and using the alternative input method explained next. My favorite way to interact with the LG 60LB7100 is using a wireless keyboard and mouse. Just plug its USB dongle in any of the USB ports in the back of the LG 60LB7100, and you're good to enjoy your TV again.I tried two sets of mouse/keyboard, one a little expensive and well known, and another that I got on sale from an unknown brand. Both were recognized and I even got my pinky teardrop back (I actually like it). For surfing the net with the LG 60LB7100, that's the way to go, type at your heart content with speed and accuracy. And you can use the Magic Remote at the same time, whatever is closer to your hand. I keep the Magic Remote by one extreme of the couch and the mouse/keyboard on the other.The keyboard's keys will replace many functions of the Magic Remote. These are some of the ones that will be most used: The Windows logo key will be the equivalent of the SmartHome key from the Magic Remote, the numbers will work to choose channels while on the Live TV screen, the arrows key will navigate among the icons in the SmartHome screen, the Page Up and Page Down will also help changing channels, and of course, the mouse will click its way all over the different menus. And while using the browser, or one of the apps, it's way better than with the Magic Remote.I like the almost full-fledged browser (yes, emphasis in almost). Which by just looking at it, it seems to run by a Javascript core with support for HTML5 and CSS3. It doesn't have Adobe Flash Player support, I shouldn't have expected it since adobe dropped Linux support a couple of years ago, and the LG WebOS it's Linux kernel based. But one girl can dream, right? Sadly, no all websites are html5 ready (the supposed substitute of the Adobe Flash Player) and it's annoying, the Internet surfing experience is not the same. But many website will fully load, and in another couple of years, the html5 will be the standard all over the net. Although, I would have liked being able to watch videos in any site from the get-go.The alternative it's to use the awesome display of the LG 60LB7100 with one of my computers, I plugged one via an HDMI cable and the LG 60LB7100 recognizes it, I mean, it  listed it on the HDMI sub-menu connected device as an Intel-based PC, and the display of its resolution is the most accurate I've ever got. I didn't have to adapt anything like in the past when I'd plugged a computer to a TV.Besides the obvious big screen, my favorite feature of owning a Smart TV is saying money. Not  just on the energy consumption, but on the cable bill. Yes, I realized that the service that I truly need and mostly use from my cable company is the high speed Internet. Because my kid mostly watches videos online and when I wanted to watch something, I was using another service, seldom their OnDemand, so I returned my cable boxes, kept only a little one which cost a couple of dollars month, and the antenna service to watch the local news, and the fast broadband they provide. The bill is cut in half, and nobody misses the countless channels nobody never watched anyway.Finally, there are some functions that I consider extras, because I don't use them as often, and that includes the 3D which works well, but I would use once in a while, and the VoiceMate which I won't be using any time soon. I'm giving the LG 60LB7100 five stars in spite of the little things that are not yet polished, because I think those could be fixed with another update and the great features in this Smart TV surpass any glitch I've experienced. I cited them all, I didn't forget anything, so I can honesty recommend it.The bottom line is, that the features I use every day are working for me greatly. The ones like the NFC tag and correspondent apps, which are not working, are something that I won't be using any time soon, hence I don't care. It's a personal thing.Please take a look to the pictures I uploaded, it won't be as having the TV in front of you, but it will give you a good idea of what you're truly getting. And if you happen to get one that doesn't work, send it back and get one that works, because it's worthy. This will be a TV that it will be up-to-date for a few years.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Like a window on a wall!", "Author": "Sam Fett", "ReviewID": "R2RISOYTORNWEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am going to write an honest review on this LG without reading off of the box or rehashing all the info in the booklet for readers.  If you have questions you can ask me I always answer the questions honestly and as soon as they appear in my inbox.  I was sitting right in front of the TV when it first booted up and I was almost blinded.  I felt like one of those comedians that grab his chest and say I am going towards the light.  The boot up screen was completely bright white when it popped on.  Then a little penguin walks you through the set up program that was one big cartoon.  It was easy to follow and I didn't even have to look at the booklet to figure it out.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  Make sure you have some help right out of the box.  To lift it out and apply the legs.  If you look at the picture you will see that the legs are on the outside of the TV.  This was the biggest problem the wife and I had was finding where to put this thing.  We haven't had a new TV since we got married ten years ago so we could not find anything to put it on after we got it set up.  It stayed on the floor for a week until we found something in our price range to set it on.  The legs on the end of the TV gives it stability but means you have to literally buy a 60-inch TV stand if you do not mount it on the wall.  The color was superb we had to do very little adjustment right out of the box.  My wife hates the new style where the people on screen seem to be moving faster than normal called smooth motion, and we quickly found a way to turn this off.  It gives you all the presets on dark or light for example a sports setting, vivid, standard, cinema, and game.  I didn't think I was going to be able to check out the 3D function because I have no 3D movies or shows but when I booted up the Netflix I was excited to see a column added that was only 3D movies.  We quickly checked it out.  My kids new favorite thing to do is watch animal shows and documentaries with the 3D.  I heard my youngest son laughing who is 7 and he commented to his sister that the bubbles were right in front of his face.  The TV has a function that will turn on the 3D to normal shows but it is not as good as the shows that are made with 3D in mind.  It comes with two glasses to wear. It was amazing!  The TV comes with  LG store, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, Amazon, Youtube, Skype, Live TV, and Web already set up. All you need is accounts.  The LG store went live and we were asked not to review it until this happened.  The LG store lets you get movies, 3D or otherwise, and purchase/rent them to watch on the TV.  Again if you have subscriptions to the above you just click them and watch.  My game systems are amazing on this TV.  I play a lot of retro games and it was neat seeing the squares and pixels. It is that clear.  As with all my reviews if I find or discover problems I will immediately update my review.  If you have questions send them my way and I will answer them with the best of my ability. One last note when it first came on it had a power save function that made the screen's light dim, which I didn't like so I turned that function off.  I am absolutely loving this TV and can't wait to watch movies on this monster.  There is no need to go to the theaters anymore because it is on my wall!UPDATE:  I was waiting to make sure on this update, but after reading others reviews one of the biggest problems I see popping up the most is horrible wi fi connection.  Stay with me on this.  It will take awhile to discuss.  I discovered why wifi is iffy on certain things only after getting a PS4.  My current router wouldn't let me hook up with certain people to play online because of a strict LAN or WAP (I think that is what it is called).  After many calls they told me that my router was old and needed to be updated for newer products.  I suspected that this was why I had trouble hooking up to netflix on this LG.  I bidded my time and after finally being able to get a new router I hooked it up to try on this set.  I was able to play the games I previously couldn't play on my PS4 so I quickly switched to my TV and put on Netflix.  In the past my movies would load fuzzy and usually stop at 25%.  With a new router it loaded up crystal clear and hardly buffered.  So long story short if you experience wifi problems you should first try other routers that are new before giving negative feedback.  I have experienced no problems with this TV especially since I upgraded my router.  The sound was so clear we were watching a movie the other night and my wife turns to me and says that the sound was so perfect you could hear the guys lips smacking together as he talked.  I would certainly recommend this set to others.  Friends that have watched movies with me are amazed at the clearness of the picture and sound.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "After hesitation.....", "Author": "Stooks", "ReviewID": "R26XGD07Z8YJ54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this television after hesitating for a bit, due to some of these negative reviews. I am upset with myself that I took as long as I did in buying this set. I had zero problems with my initial wifi setup. Zero problems with wifi connectivity at this point in time. After a quick calibration the picture is spectacular. It even does well in my moderately bright den. The stand is plenty sturdy. Not sure why anyone would have an issue with it.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Must be one of the lucky ones, so far.", "Author": "Edward \"Hockey Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RT6RHPDHG5HB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my TV from another vendor. At the time I was buying amazon was out of stock and my old 58\" Samsung plasma was getting worse and worse.Before you read too far. I do not use the streaming services at this time, so I will not write anything about that. I did get them figuring at some time I might want to add them to my cable package. I also have a 7.1 surround sound systems so will be using that for audio.Unboxing TV. This was done by delivery service. They also plugged it in and checked that it turned on.I had help installing the TV to the wall. TV weighs only 48 lbs, but the size is still too big for one man installation.You will need to purchase M6 screws to mount your bracket. I had to run out and get these because the old Samsung plasma TV was 85 lbs. and used big screws maybe M8. The M6 screws cost a couple of bucks for 4 and I got hex heads.  After mounting TV to the wall on to setup.Set up was very very easy although long. It also took a little time getting used to the magic remote. It works like a wireless mouse except it is used in the air. You need to shake it to wake it up if it goes into sleep mode.First thing you must do is pair the remote with TV then you can start programing TV setting. (HINT - I turned tv on and hit joystick to make remote show up on screen, just playing with remote out of box did nothing. Wasted over a minute on this one. I dont read instructs I fiddle first)The on screen prompts walked me through setting up my fios set up box. One programed it could work my fios box. All this turned out to be real easy. I don't like the energy saving feature at all. Turned on by default and after a few seconds the TV dims too dark for me. Turned this setting off and TV picture looks great.Watched my first 3D movie at home. I purchased an LG 3d Bluray player and some 3d movies from amazon. Will hook that up later this week and see how it that looks. All the on line reviews claim the blurays look better than the 3d on demand.Over all I am happy with my purchase the picture is much brighter than my 2008 plasma model.  I wish I could have bought this TV without the wifi and streaming for a better price but that isn't the way they make them today. I also wanted a faster TV for sports, we watch a lot of hockey in the house and was worried about blurriness because the puck moves so fast. So far so good. I will update this review as time goes on.05/06 - Used my Ipad as a hot spot and updated the shipped firmware from 3.01 to 3.23 It didnt use too much data to do so and was very easy. It did make some changes to the tv not sure what all of them are but some of the on screen set up information is now bigger and set up icon changed from left to right side.

The setup was easy, and once the updates were applied the TV was even better. I think a lot of the folks would have had a better experience with the picture if they upgraded the firmware. So far I haven't seen any defects in the picture, ,although I did use this tweaking guide:[...]The remote is interesting and works pretty well. I was pleasantly surprised with how well it worked with my DVR. Based on the previous generation of the remotes, I was expecting it to be a pain; however, it works very well with my Samsung DVR from TWC. It will be interesting to see if LG allows more apps (e.g. HBO on Demand) into the WebOS version.

I will tell you this, my urges to head to the movie theater have diminished now that I\u2019ve got a big screen of my own in the living room. Oh, and having a smart TV is pretty cool.I prefer LED as the back lighting is more efficient than standard fluorescent and LCD back lighting. LED cuts back on power and energy, and when utility costs are high, it\u2019s important to consider efficient products.With this back lighting, I also like that the picture doesn\u2019t degrade if you\u2019re sitting at an angle. No longer is sitting off to the side a problem with LG. The picture quality is excellent but you\u2019ll have to play around with the picture settings to get the brightness and such that you like. It\u2019s easy.I don\u2019t like mounting stuff on the walls, so I\u2019ve set the TV on top of a big, boxy end table of sorts. The legs of the TV are at the ends, so you can\u2019t just plop it on a small surface like other sets with center-based stands.

I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, one of the HDMI ports began to fail and caused the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy!

Smith", "ReviewID": "R2IBK59C63LESC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me say this is my second set, the first one had a backlight problem and WiFi issue. The backlight would goes go completely out and the WiFi took a long time to connect and it was slow. So I just exchanged the TV and the new one does not have these problems.This TV has an amazing picture quality and viewing angles. All of the features are nicely implemented. I really love this TV. This is Direct-Lit LED which mean the LED's are behind the panel and not on the edges(Edge-Lit). There is no clouding, light bleed or anything like that.The only thing I see is there should be more local dimming zones. I think there is only 6 zones. I had the 55LB7200 and that had 12 zones which there is 2 columns and 6 rows. A good example is when credits scroll up you can see the zones and since the credits are in the middle the you can see the light coming across the screen. You would think since it is a bigger screen than the 55 it would have the same or even more zones.The major flaw with this TV is when there is a dark scene the screen dims very dark and you can barely see anything. I posted a video on youtube and I will provide the link. I calibrated the TV and turned off energy saving and I also tried to turn off local dimming but it is still there.Global dimming is the problem. It adjusts the brightness regardless of energy settings. There is no way to turn this off. This is a stupid feature, I was reading and it has been a problem in the last 2 years and everybody hates it.When playing PS3 or PS4 game and you have a dark scene you will not be able to see anything. LG dropped the ball on this. I am very disappointed because everybody complains about it but LG does not do anything about it. They will not fix it.Here is the link......http://youtu.be/9m5a0Ph5YZ8Another problem I am having right now is it will not find the newest firmware update which is 3.23.06. Mine has 3.00.53 and since I have the older update the LG store is not there. I called LG and they have no info on this problem or even know what the current update is.

I originally bought the 7400 several months ago, though i had to keep replacing it because it would come with uniformity issues. These issues were actually in reality really minute, though when you pay so much for something you don't want to see small back lines going through your picture. When it came time to make the third replacement I decided to see what the 2014 model had to offer.When the first 7100 model got to my house it had a huge crack going through it. So I replaced it with the same model. The second model is at my house now. It works, there is no uniformity issues... though for some reason it looks like the top of my upper horizontal bezel has been melted down, and the internals are exposed. This problem does lightly effect the color around the screen. This issue doesn't effect the performance very much though it does show an extreme lack of quality assurance. There should be NO! reason for that tv to have passed any sort of quality inspection. After four replacement tvs I've began to think thats just LGs quality of service these days.Besides for the corners looking completely melted I've got to say that the picture also looks of less quality than the previous 2013 LG 7400. There is no on off button on the tv its self. The 240 hz looks worse than an LG i have that claims 120hz. The TV is extremely susceptible to judder, and movement blur. most of the 1080 content i've played has looked really blown up. The only thing I can say that this tv does better than the 2014 model, is the IPS panel has slightly better color tones.I've decided after 4 replacements I'm no longer going to buy an LG TV, potentially ever again.

It was a step up from our 50\" Panasonic plasma TV and Apple TV that we have used for a couple of years, right? NO.I am writing this review assuming that if you are going to shell out over $1500 on a smart TV, you are expecting the Smart feature to work well and allow you to stream content seamlessly and surf the web. You are not just looking for a TV with a good picture. If that's you, start looking at other models.The negatives of this TV far outweigh the positives. The picture is great on this TV and the LED screen doesn't reflect back like a plasma screen does. Those would be the plusses for this particular model.lI could tell you about the phone calls to LG tech support for starters. My first phone call yielded a call to a very nice man who truly wanted to help...but he didn't have any documentation for the TV since it was new. His solution was to reset the TV to factory settings, tell me that Netflix had a problem with their app and that I should call back and speak with a product specialist if I continued to have issues. I waited a week to call back after continual problems with the TV. This time I spoke with a woman who did know more about the unit. Unfortunately, she didn't offer advice other than to reset the TV to factory settings and to suggest that the apps had issues. It seems like LG support is pointing fingers at others rather than admitting they put a product out that hadn't been fully tested.What were the issues I was trying to resolve with tech support? Oh, this little issue of wireless internet connectivity. To use the smart features of the TV, I consider Wi-Fi rather important. After having used an Apple TV and a ROKU for a few years with absolutely no problems, I figured the experience on the Smart TV would be similar. NO. The wireless connection is hard to establish and it is dropped and the password forgotten often once you think you finally have it operating. This made it impossible to update the firmware. I finally moved the TV so I could hook it directly into the router and update the software from version 3.00.43 to version 3.23.06. I was hopeful that this would resolve my problems and I could write a favorable review on this TV. It was not to be. The Wi-Fi connection is just as unreliable. When it does operate, Netflix will function without giving me errors every time, so that is an improvement. YouTube, doesn't want to work and doing a web search is painfully slow because inputting 1 character at a time with the remote is SLOW.Ah, the remote...I must mention that too. The remote isn't so great either. When it's working well, the remote displays a raindrop shaped cursor on the screen. The issue is that the remote goes into a sleep state and you need to \"wave\" it to wake it up. That hasn't been my experience. The remote frequently requires exaggerated \"waving\" to get it to respond. When you want to change a channel and you have to spend 30 seconds waving the remote around to do so, it's frustrating for a \"premium product\" such as this \"smart\" TV.I would rate the 3D function as just OK. It certainly wasn't as good as being in a theater, but I don't know if I should expect that from a TV. The image had depth, but nothing seemed to pop off the screen. The 3D glasses are cheap quality. Perhaps better glasses would improve the experience.If you have an Android device, you should be able to use Miracast and sling the content from your device to the TV. We use Apple, so we can't test this feature. Our Apple TV made this a great feature for our previous setup. I would say that even if I did have a device with Miracast, this probably wouldn't work well on our TV due to the connectivity issues.One other thing to note, the position of the feet/stand if you are not going to wall mount this. You will need a stand at least 50\" wide. This TV does not have a center mount like most, but rather feet that are nearly at the outside width of the TV.The only reason I will rate this product 2 stars rather than 1 is that the TV picture is great. For the money, you can get a great TV picture for much less.

Seems too many glitches to fix yet LG. Shouldn't be on the market yet until all these problems are fixed. I hate the remote, it is very difficult to figure out and hard to remember because nothing on it is as it would be on any normal TV remote. It goes by icons on the remote and a scroller in the middle like a laptop mouse.The picture isn't as clear as my 7 year old Toshiba that is a 720 even though this one is 1080 and the sound quality is bad. I had to have it on 50 to even try to hear it clearly from just 12 feet away. My old Toshiba rear projection is only on 32 to hear it loud and clear.  32 is 32 and 50 is 50 so you should be able to figure out that I mean you have to have it up almost twice as loud to hear it clearly and I have no hearing issues and playing any speakers on a higher volume will wear them out sooner no matter what the brand. I changed it to Cinema sound and it helped a little but very little difference no matter what setting you put it on.The picture keep going very dark but I have learned that is because it comes factory set for the energy saver so you need to find it on that stupid remote to turn that off if you want your picture to stay clear. I did set it to Cinema viewing as well and it is the clearest you can get it, however, on my Toshiba I can set the picture to \"Full View\" so the picture takes up the whole viewing screen, even if it isn't broadcast that way. You can't do that to this TV. LG tech told me you can't and keep telling me I had to adjust that with my Dish Network remote even though I repeatedly told him that was wrong and that I could do it with my TV remote on any of my other brand TV's.The stands that are furnished are completely unsafe. I took my finger and pushed ever so slightly on it at the top corner and it didn't stop rocking for almost a minute, it's that flimsy and this TV is quite heavy, over 60 pounds. Count on having to wall mount it if you want to keep it from getting tipped over by your pets, kids or just too much jumping up and down in the room.I called LG to find what mount to use and their tech told me the brand and the item number but I couldn't find it even on LG's site or Amazon's so that was no help so I still don't know how you can figure out which is the proper mount to use for this TV. I was also told the cheaper mounts will not support this TV's weight.The titanium, or whatever they call it, that encases the outside edges of the TV is nothing special and you can't even notice that it isn't just the plain old black that almost every manufacturer uses.Th Netflix is great but that's because of Netflix, not because you're using this TV so those features really don't make this anymore special than any newer TV that offers the same features.The 3D glasses that come with are the cheapest pairs you can get, like the $9.99 specials and if you've gone to a movie theater and payed extra to get glasses to see in 3D then keep those, they are just as good as these and work the same. There are some pretty cool ones you can buy that almost look like designer sunglasses but they are about $40.It does have a clear picture, as clear as it can get on this TV, from any angle. That I liked as my 32\" Sony doesn't do that, you have to sit right in the center for viewing to see my Sony picture clearly, other wise the picture washes out.I personally feel that this TV is over priced and under used in trials to fix the issues before release to the public for purchase.I won't even comment on the other features because with this much wrong who cares if they work or how because I can't get this TV to stay connected to WIFI and had a tech do it.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": "Refresh Rate: 240Hz (Native); Motion Clarity Index: 960 (Effective)\nBacklight: LED (Edge-Lit w/ Local Dimming)\nSmart Functionality: Yes - WebOS, Includes Magic Remote\nDimensions (W x H x D):  TV without stand: 53.2'' x 31.3\" x 2.3'', TV with stand: 53.2'' x 32.8'' x 10.7''\nInputs: 3 HDMI 1.4, 4 USB 2.0, 1 RF, 1 Component, 1 Composite, 1 Digital Audio Out (optical), 1 PC Audio, 1 LAN, 1 Headphone\nAccessories Included: Magic Remote and Two Pairs of Battery Free Passive 3D Glasses", "Name": "LG Electronics 60LB7100 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Smart LED TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51POUH-tbkL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00II6VW32"}}
