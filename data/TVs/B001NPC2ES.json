Everyone that sees my TV loves the white look and think it looks great.  This of course depends on your furniture and your style at home.I don't like the feel of the remote, but I don't use it because I am using the cable box's universal remote.Functionally the TV performs better than many more expensive TVs.  There are plenty of inputs and the menus are easy to use.  I hookup my laptop to the TV often so I appreciate the RGB (VGA) input.  The picture quality is great and I would not hesitate to recommend this TV to anyone.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Advertised Wrong?", "Author": "S.
