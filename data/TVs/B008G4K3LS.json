{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Disappointing Tech support", "Author": "T", "ReviewID": "R3HYGDYKKYXYH0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received my mirrorvue from the company and the mirror is nice and pretty large, it takes two men to install it on the wall. However there were issues with getting the color and sound to the TV.  I called the company and was only able to speak to a salesperson.  The recommendation was to email the support team who resides overseas.  They took 2 days to respond.  Meanwhile I had to have the contractors hang the mirror and wait for me to get some assistance in how to get sound and color.  The support team finally emailed me back but we have been going back and forth for a week now and my t.v is still not fully operational.  I paid a lot of money for this t.v., you would think they would  have a better way of supporting technical issues.  Also I don't understand why there is no manual for the t.v.  Oh and there is no way of returning the t.v.and getting a FULL refund if you are unhappy.  Very frustrated and disappointed.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "MirrorVue review", "Author": "Blake", "ReviewID": "R352T7B7TY1VFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We just got our MirrorVue and couldn't be happier with the purchase.
