{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great LED TV with One Problem...", "Author": "Denis A.", "ReviewID": "R11POAZ99UXK23", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this is in my opinion the best TV you can buy for the money right now if you want to access Netflix and other streaming services while enjoying superb picture quality. Unlike other people that have stated that SmartTV needs a LOT of improvement, I was quite impressed with the ease of use as well as functionality of this feature. If you have a slow wireless network, do not blame the TV for not being able to deliever. I have a Lynkisys N router and Comcast as my internet service provider. There are 3 computers using this router (1 hard-wired), Xbox360 (hard-wired), printer, Vonage telephone, Blu-Ray player, Kindle Fire HD, iPod, and and iPhone and now this TV. I have yet to encounter any buffering or low resolution issues using Netflix through SmartTV app. All of the shows load up promptly and the app is yet to crash.SmartTV feature therefore gets a 10/10 in my book. Granted, entering info to search for something is somewhat annoying, but the shows you watch show up on the front page, so you do not have to look for them each time you log in. Same goes for the login info, once it is entered, it is there for good (until you reset the TV). Amazon Instant Video worked well, but I did have it hang up twice; however, I had Instant Video hang up on my laptop numerous times during the playback, so it is not the TV's fault.Picture quality is a 10/10. You can tweak all sorts of settings to get the picture the way you like it. For me, only minor adjustments had to be made, one of them being turning off the MotionPlus feature. Setting it to \"Clear\" seemed to do the same as turning it off. The contrast ratio on this TV is outstanding - black colors are black and white colors are vivid and bright.So, you might ask why I gave this TV only 4 stars. Well, after about 2 days of use, the TV developed \"clouds\" or other known as backlight bleeding. I can see about 7 of these clouds whenever a dark scene is unfolding or whenever there is a pause in a TV show where there was supposed to be a commercial break. The weird thing about these \"clouds\" is that they are not present when TV is just powered on. It takes about 15-20 minuters for these \"clouds\" to develop. They also go away once the TV is turned off for about 20 minutes and turned back on, but they do come back again. My guess is that this issue somehow relates to temperature of the TV or the screen. This is not a minor backlight bleeding you might experience with non-plasma TVs and is easily visible with even well lit room. (See product pictures)I have contacted Samsung and they will be sending a tech to my home to look into this issue. If all fails, I am still in the return window with Amazon. So the review score will go up or down depending on whether or not this issue will get fixed.Other than that, a capable SmartTV with outstanding picture quality under $1,000 is a no brainer - buy it, you will love it. Just be aware of the issues that may come up. So far, Samsung has been easy to deal with. Will update as this progresses.UPDATE: Samsung had a tech call me to get a better idea of the defect. After talking to him and the tech trying really hard to pitch me the idea that the defect is nothing but a software glitch, I knew where this was going. He talked to Samsung \"engineering\" team and after looking at the pictures I've provided them said that the TV is within specs and that the pictures are subpar at best. They also advised me to take more pictures of live scenes with the room lit up. Now, why would they want me to do that? Simple, my camera would not be able to catch the backlight bleed and thus confirming again that the TV is running \"within the specs\". Amazon is great on the other hand, processed my request for the exchange promptly and the new TV should be arriving by the end of the week. Always be prepared to deal with issues like this. I would suggest registering on video or TV forums and asking around. I was disappointed with Samsung with the way they deal with these issues.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful set", "Author": "Robert Devaney", "ReviewID": "R2JETOEU1K5QJV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Admittedly, I've only owned this set for a couple of weeks, but to this point, it's been a great experience. Set up was easy, and although I didn't need them, it was nice to see they had QR code for your smart phone to read which opened videos available on line to aid in setup and operation. I had an ethernet cable connection to a router, so an internet connection was established in seconds. Updates took a few minutes, and then it was simply a matter of re-establishing Netflix, and of course, fiddling with color and sound settings to preferences. To that end, here are a settings that I have found very good on this set:- Picture mode - standard- Backlight - 10- Contrast - 88- Brightness - 45- Sharpness - 91- Color - 34- Tint - G51/R49ADVANCED:- Dynamic contrast - low- Black tone - dark- Flesh tone - +2- RGB only mode - off- Color space - auto- 10pt white balance - off- Gamma - -1- Expert pattern - off- xvYCC - offPICTURE OPTIONS:- Color tone - cool- Digital noise filter - auto- HDMI black level - normal- Film mode - auto 2- Auto motion plus - smooth- LED motion plus - off- 10pt white balance - onDid not change other specs. Set is hooked up to Time Warner Cable. Remember to set color specs for each function (Streaming movies, Blu-ray, etc.), as the default settings remain until changed in each. Very nice app suite, beautiful picture, no complaints.

These TV's are GARBAGE! If you read my initial review i wrote it after i got one defective TV and figured a lemon is always possible, but the replacement was also defective...this time instead of the picture sometimes not coming on, the picture came on but when it first started up there were green lines all over the screen like on an old green screen apple computer when a game wouldn't load right.  Stay away from this TV...Amazon still took care of my needs as a customer but the particular model of TV seems to have serious flaws.I got my TV very quickly and was excited to set it up and see how it worked.  The very first time i tried to turn the tv on I got a black screen with a glow like the tv was on but no picture was showing up.  I turned the TV off and turned it back on and the samsung emblem popped up and then the picture came on.  I didn't think to much of it until it happened the next time i tried to turn the TV on.  I then knew there was something wrong with the tv.  I called samsung on the help line, and they told me to update my firm ware for the tv, to which i told them that this wasn't a firm ware issue it clearly was something with the hardware.  I contacted amazon and told them the problem, and that when the tv worked the picture was fantastic and it worked well, again, when the picture came on.  I was on the phone with amazon about 3-5 minutes and they shipped out a new replacement tv for me without any hassle.  This is why i gave the product a 4 star rating, because the first one I got wasn't working correctly but the customer service from amazon is why i would recommend buying this TV, as it does have a great picture and is a good price, and if you DO have problems as can happen with any electronic device, amazon will take care of the customer.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it but not exactly this one.", "Author": "Avid Consumer2023", "ReviewID": "R1GSPQFLLLNODR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this SmartTV from Bestbuy and got the 40\" version and I absolutely love it.

To save time and so that you don't have to read, i will make it simple.Pros:-Amazing Picture Quality- Screen looks great, extremely thin and sharp- Has 3 HDMI and USB ports- Has a \"Game Mode\" for people who play competitive 360 or PS3 games (which is extremely important to me), but graphics are slightly degraded and I'm sure the Hz go from 120 to 60 for a faster response- The sound is excellent for a thin TV. I barely ever have to pass 15 or 20 on the volume scale (it goes to 100) and I like my games loud :)- The motion flow is alright for movies (as long as the action isn't too fast or a panning shot), but if you use it in games it will make you lag as well as look really sloppyCons:- My Biggest gripe..... the TV constantly makes a ticking noise that never goes away. I'm not sure if my TV is defective or not, but theres a ticking noise coming from inside the TV every 10 seconds and its annoying as hell. It only does it when the TV is turned on, and when your sitting in your room or wherever you have your tv and you mute whatever your watching, you will instantly hear this noise. At first its no big deal (lots of TV's make strange noises when they are first turned on) but this on just keeps on ticking. After paying over 1 grand for this TV, you'd expect it to be fully functional without any weird issues- The TV menu is very disorganized. Its hard to find what you are looking for. Some of the settings are hidden away and take a while to find. Switching in and out of \"Game mode\" is a complete pain in the a**- The TV stand base looks dumb. I guess this is more of an opinion to be fair, but i dislike the 4 legs on the TV and would rather have a sturdy base.Overall I said a lot more good than bad, but that ticking noise just kills me. It could just be my TV is defective, but if not, Samsung customers be wary.

I don't know enough about TVs to speak confidently about the specs verses other models, however, I can say that the product looks great. The shipping process on such a high end item was a bit scary, but it worked out great. The delivery person was very professional and ensured that I was happy with the TV before leaving me to play.I played with a few of the options and took it for a test drive. To be honest, we were VERY close to returning it because the experience on it was similar to watching a soap opera. The motion and angles were making us a bit uncomfortable. After reading some of reviews, I learned that you can disable the Auto Motion feature which brought it back to the experience we were used to having while watching TV. The change was just too radical to have all at once and we may play with a few of the Auto Motion options to ease us into it.Since then, we are more than happy with the TV itself. Although loaded with features, we rarely play with any of them and only sprung for this model over the previous to get the Ultra Slim model. We use Tivo and Apple TV so have no use for the Smart software that comes with the TV.If I had to do it all over, I'd definitely go bigger. When ordering measuring 50 inches seems like a HUGE tv but I think we could have easily gotten away with a 55 or 60 inch but gave into my wife's concern that it would be too big and stuck with the 50.

Speakers are on bottom facing down and sound is hard to hear bouncing off table, may need sound bar or audio/video reciever to hear good.CONCLUSION: Definitely a BUY. Go ahead and buy screenclean kit with it and if you have kids get a wall mount and mount it out of reach.

Being a long time customer I would have thought the customer service person I spoke to in choosing this item would have advised me to wait a day or two.  In addition, I asked about a blu-ray and was advised to get the $79 Samsung when a newer model was available for only $10 more.  I have been very satisfied with Amazon for the several years I have shopped with you, but this time I am not completely satisfied.  I have only had the TV for a day and I have no complaints about its delivery or its functioning.  I am awaiting cables so I can connect the blu-ray player.  Your customer service person didn't advise me to get the cable when I ordered the player.  Thank you.

If, as I did, you bought this to be able to use with the wireless network in your house, think again.  The TV has to be within 15 feet of your router in order to get enough signal to work over the network.  None of the apps work.  Even when it does the interface you use to input information is so clunky it takes hours to do what a computer could do in minutes.  Oh and customer service is a joke.  The phone service people are barely understandable.  They sound like they are in Bangladesh.  The web site is full of hundreds of videos, none of which address the problem that you want to solve.  Don't get me wrong the picture of this TV is great, but they are selling it as a Smart TV and charging you for those functions.  You are better off buying a dumb TV and waiting for the industry to solve these problems.
