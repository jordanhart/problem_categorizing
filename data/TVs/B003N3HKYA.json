{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An excellent budget small HDTV", "Author": "Jim Schmidt \"Jimmbbo\"", "ReviewID": "RJY3LA7C2F0UR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Vizio, after watching them for a couple of years.  I bought it to replace an early 13 inch early AQUOS LCD. Over the last five years, I own/have owned Sony, Sylvania, two AQUOS and a Samsung LCDs from 13 to 36 inch.IMO, this is a great little TV.  It is very attractive, has an excellent picture, and is easy to set up. (Other than recording the model and serial numbers, I have yet to open the manual (real men don't need no stinking instructions! ;) ), and have been able to do all I want so far using the menu system...)I am sensitive to good sound quality, and was concerned about some of the reviews complaining about the sound.  Am unsure what the folks who panned the speakers expect from a 19 inch TV, and \"out of the box\" the sound is a bit thin and tinny, but getting into the setup menu and playing around with the sound settings, from automatic to \"roll your own\" in the equalizer mode provides completely acceptable sound quality (for me) with adequate volume for a small room (this tiny TV has tiny speakers.  It is NOT a Klipsch or Bose 7.1 THX speaker set).The only thing I am not wild about is the glossy \"cabinet\"... I prefer a matte/semi gloss finish, but realize I'm swimming upstream on that one, so with all the pluses for this unit, I can live with the shiny case.I am pleased with this set, and if its longevity lives up to its initial perception, Vizio has a winner in the mini TV market.  If you are looking for a small HD TV, the M190VA is an excellent choice for value, features and quality.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "I Love It!", "Author": "Dufus", "ReviewID": "R21BKPIDV6Z8OB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the 26\" version of this TV (I also own a 47\" Vizio) and I needed a small TV to use for a convention display table.  The reason I purchased this one is that it is unique in that it has forward facing speakers.  Most small TV's have downward facing speakers and in a large room they are much harder to hear.  This TV is perfect, small, loud volume and has a great picture.  I also like how Vizio packs their small TV's because they are easy to re-pack and the box can be used many times.  The base plate also comes off easy.Highly recommend.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect desktop TV", "Author": "Alan Morris", "ReviewID": "R1B1LO08WV77HX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a TV to use in a standard bedroom, this will surely fill the bill.

It's as sleek and nice looking in person and the picture is outstanding.  Hooked up to a DVD player and a Roku streaming box for Netflix and both look great.

Overall, great packaging, great shipment, super fast!However, only flaw I can tell is that my kids have bunk beds, and the tv has to be tilted a good bit for the bottom bunk to see it.  Does not have a good viewing angle, anything over 25% is grainy and shadowed. If it is for one person or a family room, where everyone sits in the same spot, at the same level, then this would make a great tv.  Super sharp, excellent brightness. Nice remote, and Plenty of connections. 3 hdmi ports!The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is b/c of the viewing issue.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great set for Xbox 360", "Author": "Gear Head", "ReviewID": "R1FP7D44LB7IHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been looking at some 19\" HDTV's to hook up to a game console so I wouldn't tie up the main set in the living room. Seen this set at WalMart for $199.99, it really caught my eye, it's smaller than your average 19\" set and has a really great picture for the price.Did some research and found that WalMart had the best deal going, OK, I was going to buy it from here but what the hey I saved some money but decided to review it here.PROS:Lots of inputs to hook up multiple gaming consolesGreat picture qualityNo screen blurring when the games get fast and furiousRelatively smallEasy set upNo dead pixels!CONS:To tell you the truth not to many, only con that I can think of its a fingerprint magnet but that's minor.I don't intend to hook it up for cable/SAT or anything but for my Xbox 360 it's a great match.I would recommend this  to anyone looking for a very good small HDTV that doesn't take up much space and has a great picture.And again I got this just for gaming and for the price it can't be beat, other HDTV's are much more expensive for the features you get in this set.I'm extremely happy with this purchase for what I'm using it for so anyone looking to buy a nice small secondary HDTV to game on this is it.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV with Excellent Sound", "Author": "D.

And you would be right, the sound quality of this tv is worst than my little 9\" audiovox lcd tv!However, if you ENABLE \"srs trusurround hd\" and DISABLE \"srs truvolume\" in the audio menu it VASTLY improves the quality of the sound.  This adjustment comes at a price, the overall volume OUTPUT is cut in half, the tv doesnt get nearly as loud and you end up going from 25-30 on the volume slider to 80-100 (100 is max) and thats just for moderate volume output.  If you plan on being in a large or noisy room this tv wont have enough power to fill the room with  decent sound.  Using any other combination of eqing within the tv menus results in terrible quality sound but much more volume power.Picture quality and the overall ergonomic design of this tv are awesome, nothing really compares in this size. The same priced hitachi 19\" sold here on amazon has the same specs and better sound abilities (quality and volume) but it suffers from the same basic design of a stand that adds height to the tv, the vizio is slick and very low profile, there is NO stand to make the tv taller and the overall clean look of the vizio beats the hitachi.

We thought we were going to have to make a new spot in our kitchen cabinetry when our old-style TV died.  Then we found this one, which measured exactly what we needed for our old spot.  I was so relieved that I was willing to settle for less quality, just for the fit.  But the quality is VERY GOOD, especially for the price.  Like another reviewer mentioned, I like that the speaker is on the front of the TV.  It does sound a bit tinny but it is in my kitchen so that is OK.  We think the picture quality is completely satisfactory.  It was a breeze to set up with its channel scanning wizard.

I had previously purchased a Poloroid Flat Screen from Walmart - it went blank after several months with no recourse from Walmart or Poloroid.  Granted, I did not buy the extended warranty.  After some internet research, I discovered many other dissatisfied Poloroid customers had the same experience.As I had already purchased a larger Vizio for my livingroom (and been very satisfied), I figured this would be a safe bet.  It's easy to see from across the room, any angle - great picture and, has a larger screen, yet fits perfectly under the kitchen cabinets.  We have the Vizio hooked up to the same DVR in the livingroom, so can watch / hear the same programs in both rooms - a real asset for those doing kitchen duty and/or eating at the kitchen counter.

I'd hemmed and hawed about purchasing this particular set given the comments made about the sound quality. But considering it was going into a vacation home, the price of a refurbished unit was very reasonable, and one reviewer had written they were able to improve the quality of the sound by making adjustments to the treble and bass I decided to take the plunge. I can confirm the sound quality is less than optimal and as many have described \"tinny\"..... and I've not had any luck with making adjustments. In fact it is my belief that the design/quality of the speakers is so poor that I am finding it hard to detect any appreciable change in sound quality even when pushing the bass and treble settings to the extremes.  So it's a OK set, the set up was straight forward, picture quality is good, but if sound quality is important this is not the set for you regardless of price.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for My Needs", "Author": "Imrihil", "ReviewID": "R1QBGMDQB2QH2B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Vizio Razor for one reason:  Unlike most flat TVs that sit on a central stand, the front of this TV contacts the counter surface.  This helps me to hide the extra cable and converter box that Comcast requires--even for a digital set.  I almost bought a similar Vizio model at Wal-mart for $199, but it was only 720p, wasn't LED backlit, and came in black only.  When I saw the white model with 1080p resolution and LED backlighting for a mere $189 on Amazon, I couldn't resist.  The TV is perfect for the kitchen counter and produces an excellent picture with an easy-to-change aspect ratio.  It also offers many different input methods, including USB for showing photos from a flash drive.  The sound, however, is unimpressive, and has a basement echo characteristic to it.  At first, I found this annoying, but I've grown accustomed to it.  In spite of the \"unusual\" sound characteristics, I would still recommend this TV a utilitarian for a kitchen or garage in which TV will be background entertainment.

On HD you can see every hair on a persons head.2. Sound is satisfactory for a small tv which will be used in a small room such as a bedroom or kitchen.3. Comes in white which is good for my kitchen.4. A button on the remote will give you a description of the current program and information on the next scheduled program. A real convenience which helps with planning what you will watch next.What I don't like:1.  Viewing angle is fine left to right (horizontally) however vertically (up and down) it is terrible.  A slight change of angle and the picture darkens.  If you are standing and looking directly at the screen the picture is excellent, but sit down and the picture darkens considerably---very annoying.  The stand is not adjustable.  Look slightly up or down at the screen and it darkens it to the point that something must be done.

I was totally impressed with all of the stations I got without the cable box.  Who knew that my channel 6 Philadelphia station had 5 variations?I have only one complaint and albeit is minor it was still annoying.  The mounting holes for the industry standard VESA mounting kit were slightly skewed.  My best guess is no more than a 1/16th or 2/16\"  but the TV is slightly off kilter.  Before you assume I am the village idiot, I did us a level to mount the bracket on the wall and if I put the level on the bracket with or without the TV attached, the bracket is level.  I can only conclude that the mounting holes on the TV were slightly off.

Additionally, the television will need to be placed at eye level or lower; when looking up towards the TV the picture fades/washes out.  I have to place a prop (or cable) underneath the back of the stand to tip the screen forward.  Lastly I have one bad pixel on the screen, but instead of not working it just always shows red.

But oh wait! I've owned quite a few LCD and Plasma Flat Panels since they first came out, and I've had the opportunity to see dozens more owned by friends. So I think I've had a bit more \"reference base\" than most owners of this model have had.I was looking for an inexpensive small LCD to use in my office as a combination extended monitor for my Notebook PC and as a TV, so a pure monitor was not an option. I needed something with HDMI, VGA an Component Inputs as well as a very good Digital Tuner for \"over the air\" broadcast HD TV.  We have an over saturated selection of strong signal in the LA area, but coastal Orange County (CA)is an orphan in the eyes TV Station market - they know we're here, but you only get the left-overs, no digital repeaters anywhere near in the \"OC\". You had better have a darn good antenna, a strong signal amplifier and a very good tuner in your TV! More than half the channels unfortunately, are in anything but English. Usted habla ingl\u00e9s?The Vizio 19\" Class 720p 60Hz LED LCD HDTV M190VA (actually barely a measured 18.5 inches) has a decent tuner, but hanging onto marginal stations signals is not it's strong suit. You'll experience considerable picture pixelization \"breakup\" and lose of sound frequently with change of weather, day-night time viewing and windy days. I never see any of these problems on the several Samsung LCD's I've owned. I could never get channel 7 (KABC) in LA, thanks partially to their stupidity of selecting a Digital technology that is different than any other broadcaster in the LA market! Smart fellas! However, our 50-inch Samsung Plasma does get KABC 7 just fine. (the wife would kill me if she didn't get to watch Desperate Housewives.)Picture quality leaves a lot to be desired too. SDTV broadcasts were always extremely \"Grainy\" and even many 720p and 1040p HD were blurry and slightly grainy. (yes, I know this is a 720p HD TV). I was very-very disappointed in this result. Only the strongest of LA stationsColor quality is nothing like the specs elude to (or what many review claim). No matter how much adjusting I did to the limited temperature and color controls on the Vizio 19\", I never got anywhere close to real human skin tones. Other colors like Greens and Blues were exaggerated too. It was really obvious with I used the Vizio as an extension monitor via HDMI connection to my high-end notebook PC. My HP Entertainment Center Notebook was color tester spot-on right from the box. Compared to the HP, the Vizio looked like a cheap dime store comic book in exaggerated and \"off\" colors. I would rate this Vizio as one of the worst I've ever seen with only \"Westinghouse\" and other \"off brands\" doing worse or the same.The remote control is nice and well layed out, but the TV on-screen controls are confusing and many functions are \"locked out\" when certain functions are selected and you get no warning of this. The manual is just plain useless as is Vizio Tech Support in helping you set up or explain control functions.Sound is weak if you are in anything but a small quiet room; however considering the size of the tiny speakers in the bottom of the Flat Panel, the fidelity is not too bad. You will get a \"stereo\" choice, though you can't really tell it's stereo as the speakers are too close to each other.Now for the \"Cheap-skate\" aspect of Vizio. I intended to mount this LCD TV / Monitor on a desk stand with a standard X mount, which Vizio does support. However, there were no mounting screws in the box with the TV! I couldn't even find any info in the patetic manual about what the screw size was (obviously metric). When I contacted Vizio Support, they said that they don't provide those screws (4) and they should come with the wall or desk mount! WHAT!!?? I said to them \"how is a mount manufacturer supposed to know what screws every TV is likely to use?? (every other LCD and Plasma I have ever owned came with mounting screws). Conclusion - Vizio = Cheap skates. BTW - I finally found out on the Vizio website that the screws are M4 x 10mm with .7mm pitch. You're local Ace Hardware may or may not carry these, so good luck!Conclusion - I have no idea where all these glowing reviews are actually looking at. Maybe this it the first new LCD they've bought in 8 years or the reviewers need glasses. IMHO, the Vizio LED LCD TV M190VA is VERY over-rated in picture quality. Quality of manufacture is decent and finish is OK. I'd suggest that you consider better brands like Samsung, Sony, LG, Toshiba, etc., rather than Vizio.

Set up was easy, but it the TV is unable to get a signal on the antenna mode.  I checked a TV Website and found that the address if 10 miles from the TV tower (on the Willis/Sears building in Chicago).  I really expected this TV to be able to get a signal from only 10 miles away without having to add an antenna, especially when the broadcast antennas are on top of one of the worlds tallest building.  I can only assume that Vizio must have a very poor antenna in the TV.  VERY DISAPPOINTED in this TV for that aspect.  I can't review the picture, sound or anything else as all I get is \"no signal\".  In my opinion, if your wanting a TV for over the air signal, stay away from this one.Update - Was on my way to get an external antenna for this TV when I stopped at a garage sale and they had one for fifty cents.

I've never purchased any kind of TV in my life that did not come with some sort of antenna, but Vizio decided not to include one with this TV.  I guess they think everyone on the planet has coax connecting them to cable or a dish.  News: some of us are still happy to get our signal off the air, you need to include at least a basic whip antenna.  I had to rig up something until I can get out and buy an antenna.Picture's great, depending on the source.  The speakers, of course, are a joke; I have this in my computer room, so I routed the headphone output to my line input on my computer.  A lot of fiddling with volume settings, but I get better quality that way.You cannot individually tune in a channel if it gets missed from the initial channel scan.  This is a common problem with TVs these days.  If you get a better antenna you have to rescan everything (and then take out all the home shopping, foreign language and religious programming channels all over again.)Because the base is integrated into the unit, there's no tilting up or down, which limits where you can put the TV.  I had to slice a cork in half and wedge it under the base in back to tilt it a little downward for the best picture.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Should have gone bigger", "Author": "Arthur E.
