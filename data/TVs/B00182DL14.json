The feature set is excellent 4xHDMI etc.Compared to the VU42 (which we had also), this has a nicer picture and much more control through the menus for Picture and Sound tweaking.The HDMI worked perfectly with our laptops and good screen controls allows you to adjust margins to use the full screen.I've had many HD sets over the years, for the money this is a good deal.Tuner Tip: In our area, Cable doesn't scramble many digital channels, but many are just sound, duplicates or unwanted.  This set seems to have a cap of 500+ channels, because while we could tune in more channels, The Channel skip did not show them.  But this set has \"Partial channel search\", which allowed us to manually seek ranges of channels and customize the channels the way we wanted.  The VU did not have this and forced us to flip through 50 or so \"bad\" channels with no way to remove them.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "solid picture", "Author": "Evan Eberhardt", "ReviewID": "R34OWL99BG6PUR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The HD picture on this set is very good.  Do not be fooled by the price.  The SD DVD progressive scan picture (480p) is also quite good.  Regular SD (480i) is pretty ho-hum.  In fact, if you have a sizable tube and are not planning on upgrading to HD service (although major networks are free with an antenna and look great), you might as well hold off.  This is the case for any HD LCD.  They are designed for HD and all of them just look so-so with standard definition.The sound is also solid, very impressive for a flat panel.  It also has ample inputs, although the ones on the underside are a pain to hook stuff up to (prepare to be cranking your head sideways to see just where the HDMI plugs in).The remote is the weakest point of the set.  It has a layout that in not intuitive.  I still keep looking for the 'menu' button to play with the picture and features forgetting that you have to press the orange 'V' in the middle.All around though, the set is a good value.  If Sony or Samsung are not in your budget, you will not be disappointed by this Vizio.  One more thing; I think the 120hz feature is not a must have, at least for films.  I haven't seen it for video games, but for movies it just doesn't look quite right to me.  Some blur is natural.  So, don't be lured away by that as it is a feature I would rarely have used anyway.Update:  This Vizio set has held up now for about 22 months.  There has been one extremely annoying issue though.  On occasion (a few times a month, randomly) when watching broadcast TV via an antenna the set freezes with the speakers blaring static noise at max volume.  This of course scares anybody in the room half to death...which has become quite tiresome (to the point that a new HDTV will be purchased in the near future and this set is going to a bedroom).  The remote has no effect when this happens, so the only fix is to unplug the set (with the noise blaring in my ears as I do so).  It only does this with the TV tuner, so the issue is clearly with that part of the set.  On all the other inputs, HDMI, component, AV, RGB, it has been fine.  The picture has been excellent on this set though, which has left me ambivalent about Vizio.  Obviously Vizio must cut costs somewhere to be more affordable and unfortunately for me it has caused this problem that I have never had happen on other sets.  So, it is something to consider in the future when buying a TV.  Sony, Samsung, and other makers cost more but I suspect they probably have more thorough quality control than Vizio, which prevents bizarre issue like this one.  I sent two emails to Vizio tech support wondering if there was a simple fix like a reset procedure, but never got a reply.  And since the set is out of warranty I know a fix will cost more than this annoyance is worth and that money will be better spent on a new HDTV.  I have not ruled Vizio out for a new TV, but I am not as gung-ho for them as I used to be.", "Date": "November 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Exceptional value", "Author": "Beechwood Knoll \"beechwoodknoll\"", "ReviewID": "R3MQT7FSDZ61ZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Vizio set.

Once I find a product that I like I always look to that manufacturer whenever I have another purchase need.I recently finished my basement and added a family room to my home.  I already had a Vizio 37\" LCD TV in my living room for close to a year and absolutely loved the quality, especially for the price.  At that time I had read an article that Vizio was going to be the Sony of the future.  After watching my two TV's I have no doubt they will someday rise to that level.I didn't have HD service with my first TV, but added it after I bought my 42\" and like it even more.  The picture quality seems to be as good as any other I see in the stores.

First we got a free HD cable box upgrade with component video output, hooked that up. Picture and sound were great. Cable box failed, got new cable box with with HDMI, and picture is even better! Basketball, baseball, hockey all look real sharp, haven't noticed motion blur to be a problem. (I found that some sports come to me at 720p, others in 1080i, both look great.) Occassionally there is some pixelization, and unfortunately I have no way of knowing if it's the TV or the cable box. Hooked up some rabbit ears briefly, just as an experiment, and over the air HD looked very nice. Sideways viewing angle is fine. The TV is on a stand that is about 30 inches high. The picture looks great from normal sitting viewing position. But if you're standing, near the screen, you can see some decreased contrast due to the vertical angle. Wall mounting a foot or so higher would be better. Standing a few feet away, as you might do for some video games (Wii Fit, DDR), there is a little contrast loss, but it's barely noticeable--no complaints from the teenagers. Also tried hooking up my computer via RGB and that looks just fine. Played a 1080p video from the computer, quality is excellent. Had to call customer support to get PIP working; for some reason the default was PIP disabled by parental consent setting. Stereo sound is clear with excellent separation.UPDATE: After about one month, the picture started showing red and green noise. I called Vizio, and they made an appointment for a service visit. They replaced a board, and the problem seems to be fixed. The service guys said this was a common problem.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Value?..Not a chance...", "Author": "B.

I will admit I am on a budget so that did play a role in my decision.  After much debate I decided to go with the refurbished model but was nervous that it would have some problem but WOW it looks and works perfect and saved a bunch!!  I am using it in my bedroom at a distance of about 13 feet away and only using standard definition hooked up and I will tell you the picture is great!! My dad came over and swore that it was hooked up to hi def. My tv in the living room is hooked up to hi def and looks about the same. Yes I did play with all the settings to get the picture to look that good. The sound on this tv puts my 62 inch Samsung to shame. The sound is fantastic on this and has many adjustments.  There is plenty of inputs and outputs on this one. 4 HDMI wow!!Overall I really love this set and wish I had bought Vizio for my living room instead of Samsung but of well.

My family is not a bunch of couch potatoes so the television never received any excessive usage.  We were watching a movie the other night when the screen went black.

I did some further research and discovered that this problem has become so common with Vizio that they have dubbed this issue the \"Black Screen Of Death\".  I will never own a Vizio again and I will warn all those who ask me about buying a television to stay away from Vizio!!!!!I recommend doing some research before you purchase your next television!

The setup is very easy and it's not hard to get a great picture after messing around with setting a little bit. The default settings were a little off for my taste (a little too much color and contrast.) The speakers on the TV sound great and do not distort until extremely high volumes.
