I've replaced the batteries twice.  the kicker... there is no control panel on the tv... the only button is the On/Off button.  My cable remote (coded correctly) does not function with the needed features to switch between inputs.  So now the unit is stuck on the TV input and all I have is snow...Not recommendedThe 37 inch only has the 1 button as well... never againIf you have to get (like I did) a universal remote... the Westinghouse code won't give you all the buttons (like the one to change input... you'll see the input options but won't be able to lock it in).  Strange after being on the phone with Westinghouse Tech support for almost 25 minutes, the Tech happened to mention in passing \"use the Sony code\" for my universal remote to work with \"ALL\" the buttons/features... My universal remotes now works using the Sony.  Because my TV was still under warranty... Westinghouse is shipping me a remote.The only good feature regarding this unit is the VGA port... I am an IT person so I run dual monitors using the TV as one of the monitors...Keep an extra remote on hand if you decide to get this unit.  My unit is 7 months old and the remote went out...", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Westinghouse 32\" Class 720p LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ykEEA0SrL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BYG3O2K"}}
