I did find out that it is made by Samsung and that was O.K. for me. I paid 2000.00 for this 5 years ago.  Other than the remote being just \"FUNKY\", I have no complaints.  The picture is as bright, clear and beautiful as the day I first powered it up.  Even though it is only ED, my family and friends who own HD's can't tell the difference, of couse with a HD signal. Picture quality in standard broadcast is not that good, actually awful.  But who would buy a ED or HD tv without having a HD incoming signal?  If I can find a new \"old stock\" of this same unit I would buy it in a heartbeat.  Especially for the price you would be able to buy it for today.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price", "Author": "F.

The buttons on the display unit I played with felt loose and unresponsive, and the picture quality was very disappointing.  Anything darker than 50% gray became indistinuishable, and colors are washed out and unpleasant.
