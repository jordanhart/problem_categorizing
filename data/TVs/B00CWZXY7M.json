I have larger TV's that are 1080p and didn't know if the picture would be better in the 22\" size or not. However, the picture is amazing to say the least. My wife who isn't interested in tv even commented on the picture quality of this little tv. I haven't used it in our RV yet but I know it will produce a great picture when either watching OTA broadcast or when using our dish network hd satellite system.This tv is very thin and has great viewing at almost any angle.As far as the sound goes, it isn't as bad as some have reported for this size screen. It does have an earphone out on the back and optional powered speakers can easily to attached if wanted. I don't find the built-in speakers to be as bad as some report. A small tv just has small speakers and these do produce adequate sound.It only has one HDMI input but that should not be a problem.I am very pleased with this little tv and I know we will enjoy it when we put it in our travel trailer.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "good tv bad descryption", "Author": "nate", "ReviewID": "R3EN5QWQAA0BBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a very good tv not a monitor it can be used as a monitor the picture is very good it only has one of each component input so if you have lots of stuff to hook up at once look for one with multiple inputs if not and you want a good small tv g for it LG 22\" 1080p IPS Monitor, TV Tuner, HDMI", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the cost.", "Author": "Michael P", "ReviewID": "RKY7HGHQ5QR4G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my kitchen.

Nellans", "ReviewID": "R2YZY2I4CDC3QZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good picture, decent tuner, adequate sound.  Not a good choice for some cable customers, as it seemed to be confused when automatically scanning for channels at my office.  I'm using it at home with just an antenna connection and it works nicely; the on-screen descriptions of OTA broadcasts is appreciated.  The sound level seems above-average in its category.  I'm not crazy about the way they integrated the VESA mounts into the back of the housing.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loved the Gift", "Author": "Army girl", "ReviewID": "R1R7QIGKVHDIUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for a friend stationed in Afghanistan.
