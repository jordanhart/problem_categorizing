My reception signal was good and after allowing the TV to scan and capture all the air channels available, I adjusted the picture quality and the sound quality to their best levels.The picture quality is just barely average...nothing to rave about, but it is the sound quality that really misses the mark. The TV sounds like an old transistor radio, very tinny and shallow. For this reason I cannot recommend this TV as a good buy.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good 12v TV", "Author": "dsctm3", "ReviewID": "RWOHS21A2NBWA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this TV for a small travel trailer.
