{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressive Picture and Brightness", "Author": "Jonathan VanOsten \"jvo\"", "ReviewID": "R3COH7K0AS7CPW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV a little bit over a month ago and have put in about 100 hours of viewing I would guesstimate.  After that time I would say the TV has an incredible picture.  Some people said the color variation was a little off but I haven't seen this.  I did setup the custom picture setting by using the THX video optimizer included with newer pixar movies and star wars films.  This made a big difference in overall picture quality and was very easy to do.  The brightness of this display is impressive even when first turned on.  The CCFL backlight seems to come to full brightness very quickly and evenly distributes the brightness extremely well.  Color representation appears to be dead on with all types of media (cable, blu-ray, dvd, ps3, xbox).  The motion plus feature is great when watching sports but can cause some juddering effects while watching non-sport content.  The response time for video games is also a plus with no visible judders but this is with game mode turned on.  The tv really does have the deepest blacks I have ever seen on a LCD panel, especially one that is not LED backlight.  I have options turned on to increase blacks and increase the degree of difference between light and dark areas of the screen. Blu-rays look absolutely stunning and upconverted DVDs look pretty good.  I use an external audio system so I can't really comment on the sound of the TV but I would imagine it's on par with other TVs.  All in all it is an awesome TV with a very solid build and great looks.  The TV has a lot of inputs which is a plus and the TV guide is great (if you would use it).  The only other thing I would like is to see the TV with a glossy display to see if the color pops even more.  I would definitely recommend this TV but would also recommend taking some time to setup the picture settings and experimenting a bit to see what looks best for the type of content your viewing.", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony 46xbr6", "Author": "JJC \"Jim\"", "ReviewID": "RRV9UJ7RBXZEF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a Sony 46XBR6 from Amazon.com  Sony wins hands down on Value,and Quality,over other brands.The TV that I am replacing is a Sony (18 yrs of service and still works very good).

This set is replacing my 32\" KDL-32S3000, which was also a fantastic TV, just a little too small for my new residence.Anyway, the color is gorgeous, and the picture quality is astounding. The sound is alright, as is to be expected from small in-cabinet speakers. Sony's PS3-esq menu system is a nice touch. The TV actually uses the second revision of it, so it makes a little more sense on this one than it did on the older models.Feature set is great as well. Sony has a lot of nice little touches on this unit really help it stand out. The logo glows, for example, but you can shut it off. In the off setting, it still lights up when the TV is powered on or off, but it gently fades out after a few seconds. Ambient light sensor to control the brightness is a nice, as well as the built-in (and free) TV Guide (though I presume this would be less useful for folks using a cable box).The remote is nice - just like the rest of the bravia line, and it has a programmable backlight too. It will function as a universal remote, and has the buttons to control a VCR or DVD player as well.All in all, this is a fantastic set, and I'm very excited to continue to use it.", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Picture Perfect!", "Author": "N.P.

We are very happy with it.  The resolution is great on HD channels, though it took a little while to get used to the non-HD channels...you can now see all the flaws and defects in the broadcast signals.  :-)The 'white-glove' delivery service was very good.  The delivery was earlier than originally expected!  They called to schedule a delivery time.  I did the setup myself...but the drop off was great.  They did the unpack and verified that everything was working before they left.Our family room has lots of windows, which is one reason I went for the LCD and the Sony in particular.  It has a bright and colorful screen and can easily handle a bright room setting.The viewing angle does make a difference.  The picture is better with straight on viewing.  While the picture is still good at an angle, it takes a little time to get used to it.Some reviewers had complained about the onscreen menus being too complex, but I have found them easy to navigate.  The paper manual is lacking in detail for some of the more advanced features.The set actually has some great features that are not well explained by the product description above.  Not well documented in the manual either.Here are a couple of examples:  * You can load digital photos on a flash drive and plug the flash drive directly into the TV's USB port to do a slideshow on the TV...no PC required.  * The TV has an ethernet port and you can connect over ethernet to a media server to directly play movies, show photos, or play music on the media server.  The documentation is not very good on this but it is a cool feature.  * You can plug your laptop into the TV (you have to buy the cables separately) and play movies off the Web on the TV through the laptop in Real time.  I did this with a documentary on Netflix and the resolution and refresh rate were good, but I haven't figured out how to get the picture to come up full size yet. It comes up as a box in the center of the screen (about 2/3 of the screen).Here are a couple of things that I wish were better:  * It should have wireless ethernet rather than just a hardwire port.  I have found some converters, but that adds more expense.  Running cables isn't an appealing option when I already have a wreless network in the house.  * The documentation is poor on some of the more advanced features, e.g. networking.  I am a fairly technical person and have been able to figure it out but wouldn't recommend this to the technically challenged...call Geek Squad or an IT savvy friend if you want to set it up.Overall, we are happy with the purchase and would do it again.

The Sony Bravia XBR KDL-46 from the quality perspective is as good as it gets.  Crystal clear HI DEF and the non-HI DEF shows an amazing improvement also.  Obviously, I cannot comment on the reliability at this point but the Sony it replaced was 25 years old and fault free.  A word of caution in choosing your service provider.  Make sure that they do not interfere with the functionality of your television.  Specifically, your PIP capabilities. My new cable provider has helped me around this problem (thanks to the multiple inputs of the TV) but it is still not to the perfection it should be.  I could not be happier with Amazon, the set arrived as scheduled, undamaged with the \"White Glove\" handler very helpful and courteous.

I have already updated the software on my TV.  When watching content that alternates between light and dark scenes, the auto dimming creates an experience that is frustrating to watch; switching on and off.  This makes calibrating this TV impossible.  There are no current options to turn this so called \"feature\" off.  I understand the purpose of this feature to to increase the dynamic contrast ratio of the TV, but when the TV is displaying a dark scene with sparse light the auto dimming on the TV engages and makes the image difficult to see.  It does so in a manner not consistent with the intended viewing of almost all video content displayed on the devise.  This must be resolved.  This is not an isolated occurrence.  I have been in contact with dozens of people that have this TV and it happens on all of them, and it is a major concern to all of them.  There are numerous devises that directly compete with this one and offer a more competitive price point at that.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome, Awesome!", "Author": "D. Holloway", "ReviewID": "R30BLXGX5FUVNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this now for a little over two weeks, and am blown away by the picture quality.  The reviewer who complained about only one rf antenna input needs to get a new set top box from the cable company or change to a new provider.  I am subscribed to Verizon FIOS in the Maryland suburbs, and their set top box for HD has multiple outputs including an HDMI. This TV has multiple inputs, including a single RF input for off the air or cable; three older yellow, red and white types; two component inputs, 4 HDMI inputs plus a PC and DMeX input.  This should cover everyone's needs. The remote will control up to 4 devices including Verizon's STB, and you can program it tell you what device you are connecting.Overall, I was pleased with the white glove delivery.  The CEVA company out of Odenton said they would deliver it between 10 and 3, but the driver didn't arrive until 5.  In his defense, he said that this was the last of his 22 appointments for that day.  He came in and helped to move the older 32 inch CRT TV, and to set up the SONY.  He didn't leave until the new TV was working properly, which was easily done.So far everything is working perfectly, and if I could, I would give it more than 5 stars.I have been an Amazon purchaser for almost ten years, and have never been disappointed.", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia 46\"  XBR6", "Author": "Jeremy Seligman", "ReviewID": "R1YO7GMGKL6RDZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony Bravia XBR KDL-46XBR6 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTVThe Sony Bravia KDL-46XBR6 was our choice after a lot of research into HDTVs. The Sony Bravia XBR6 series was best suited to our preferences because of its picture quality, audio quality, and high end feature set. Since picture quality is reviewed by many others, I'll concentrate on the audio and feature sets.Audio: The sound was far and away the best of any of the sets we compared. We do not have a home theatre setup at the moment, so we are relying on the built-in stereo speakers.  The XBR6 projects a clear stereo image with better bass response than you normally get from inboard TV speakers. They claim in the marketing literature that you get a surround-sound type image, but I don't think it lives up to that claim. In addition, there are audio settings that allow you to customize the sound a bit, sort of like a primitive equalizer. Also, there is a cool feature that brings out the voice over other audio on hard to hear movie soundtracks.Feature Set: Mixed reviews here, although still an overall positive. The TV has a USB port, and we have successfully shown slide shows using pictures we brought over from our computer with a flash drive. I would like to have more control over the slide show feature on the TV, which is fairly primitive. We have not been able to get all USB devices to be recognized by the TV.  It seems the more basic, the more likely it will recognize them.We have successfully used the TV as a monitor for a PC. This is simply a matter of connecting the two with an RGB cable. This allows us to display powerpoints and other documents, and display web sites through the computer's wireless capability to the TV.The disappointment has been the networking capability. There is a network port for a wired connection to the network. The device picks up an IP address from the DHCP on the router (this part is for the more technically inclined), but I can't do anything with the device even though I see it on the network. I can ping it, but can't interact with it any other way. I have spent hours on web sites and on the phone with Sony, but noone has been of any help with this. A big disappointment.Otherwise, a great TV. We're enjoying it immensely, and find that it provides a clear image even in our den, which has a glass western wall and gets a lot of afternoon and early evening sun.", "Date": "January 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nicest I've ever had...", "Author": "Gary L.

TV is very nice. Very sharp picture. Automatically switches inputs for you which I find very nice (when watching TV and you load a DVD, it switches to DVD for you. When you turn DVD off, switches back to TV for you). Viewing angle is as they say it is, about 178 degrees, but as you move to the side the colors fade a lot so it's not a sharp picture from extreme angles. Very nice appearance. It's a fixed stand so you can't turn the TV when mounted but mines on the wall. Very nice set.", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Joel Smith", "ReviewID": "R1OBHGQHHJRIZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a long review. Short Version: excellent TV, worth the price, compares favorably to alternatives.I'd caution anyone buying any TV to check out a few other sites before making your decision: [...] will guide you better than any amazon review can. With regards to this TV, here are my thoughts:This (now last generation) LCD TV is very, very good. LCD technology has progressed soundly and always seems to pass the bounds of what seems possible (at least, in my expectations). There is very little motion blur anymore for most applications, the image is crisp, SD images are getting better and overall things just look great. This TV is no exception and delivers top notch performance on every level, with only a few qualms.The picture:The picture is excellent with deep blacks (but not the deepest) and very good color accuracy. There are many different configurations you can change beyond the standard set that will make the job of adjusting the TV to the proper values a little difficult, but once it's set, you should be good for most situations.  Out of the box, the picture looked great as well, but was simply too dark for me. If you look around on AVSforum, you should be able to find some configurations for this TV set.The Sound:The TV comes with a removable sound bar to impart greater sound than a typical LCD set. This might be the case, I don't know. I use a surround sound system that doesn't go through the TV speaker. We used this tv's sound briefly, but it doesn't compare to a surround sound set up pretty much ever. Bottom line: if you're using the TV speakers on any LCD/Plasma right now, these speakers will be at least as good as those.The Remote:Another \"I don't use this\" section. I use a Logitech Harmony remote (550) to control all of my components, so I'm not sure how good the included sony remote is. It seems like it's a fine remote, with all of the necessary buttons. I haven't heard of the remote breaking on anyone, so I'm guessing it's in the \"good enough\" category.The Interface (the menu layout/control scheme):Sony uses the cross bar interface on this TV which on first glance/first use really isn't that great. The good news is that as you use the cross bar, you'll like it more. It's simple, easy to use, and fairly easy to find things. It's not particuarly pretty, but not so ugly that you'll want to avoid using it. It's entirely functional, and what more can you really ask for? The included features and adjustments are many, and you shouldn't have a hard time enabling or disabling any feature you like or dislike.Some other notes:120Hz: Personal opinion: looks bad. I'd recommend turning off this feature for most shows/movies/whatever. Some stuff does look fine though (sports, mostly), and I think people can get used to the weird effect it makes. This TV has 3 levels: High/low/off. Low works fine, but again, you're better sticking with off.LED Backlighting (\"LED TV\"): This TV doesn't have this, and it looks like most of the higher end TVs in the new/current generation will have this. These TVs don't really look that much better than this TV, and the viewing angle tends to be worse. For me, the price differential doesn't make up for the supposed benefits of these TVs.Plasma Vs LCD: both of these technologies are getting better all the time. At this point, it really doesn't matter which you choose, both will look great. I chose an LCD TV because I wanted the longer lifespan, and no risk of burn in. The colors on this TV are already excellent and the motion blur on this TV is pretty unnoticable as well. If you're hung up over this, try going to a store and comparing in person.Shortcomings:There's really only been one issue with this TV, and that's that it's got a feature where the picture will adjust to the colors on the screen. If it's a dark scene, the backlighting/picture will dim, and if it's a bright scene the blacklighting/picture will get brighter. Sounds fine in theory, but this change is slow and noticable in some movies and shows. Most get used to this effect, but it's a deal breaker for others. A firmware update in the future could correct this, but for now (as far as I know) it's there.Final thoughts:As I've said before, this TV is very good and I would highly recommend this TV to anyone I knew that was looking for a new, topish of the line TV. With the current/new generation of TVs coming out, it will lose some of it's luster, but the TV is still quite solid. The inevitable comparison will be against a Samsung A750 TV, and it compares quite nicely. A Samsung A750 S panel will probably look as good as this TV for a little less. Compared to the slightly lower Z series TV (Sony Z4100), this TV adds a little for a little more. Better contrast ratio, better sound, arguably nicer framing, potentially a few less issues overall for a slightly higher price.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "Frank Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R2S0P49D362PCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my 46XBR6 yesterday and I tested it out.

A while back, an Aquos display at the mall caught my eye, but that was set up with a DVD to show off the display. The Aquos didn't look as good to me at the other stores. At regular stores like Costco, Sam's club, and Best Buy, etc... the Sonys always looked best to me, especially the XBRs which not everyone carried. I narrowed it down to compare the new Samsung LEDs with the Sony XBRs. I saw a new 40\" Samsung B6000 next to a Sony 40\" XBR6 at Best Buy and the Samsung picture looked only slightly better, but not $600+ better. The Sony was selling for $1,444, and the just-out Samsung for like $2100. I decided on the Sony, and Amazon Warehouse Deals had an open box 46\" for about the price of a 40\". The listing said there were slight cosmetic blemishes on the case.  I was a bit apprehensive, but since amazon had the 30-day return, I went for it. The shipping company was Pilot, and my delivery guy was top-notch. He called one hour before to confirm the address, and plugged the unit in to show it worked. He even called an hour after to check if everything was ok and to remind me to keep the box for 30 days in case of problems. I read some people complain of the delivery guys not mounting on the wall, but Pilot mentioned that when they called. Their guys do not mount the TV on the wall for liability reasons, so you have to make arrangements for that yourself. I inspected the TV and could not find any of the cosmetic blemishes mentioned on Amazon WD. So far the TV works great and looks awesome. Sometimes the reds look a bit too red, but I haven't played with the colors too much yet. That's it as far as the imperfections for me. I haven't hooked up a DVD/Blu-ray player yet, but every HD channel looks lifelike, and the non-HD (and HD) channels look better than my dad's Panny Vieria plasma. I'm sure with a picture this good the Blu-rays will be breathtaking! The sound is sufficient for a bedroom, though in larger spaces I could see wanting a theatre system to fill the space. Overall I'm very happy with the TV and this one should suffice for a few years! 5 stars for the TV and Amazon Warehouse Deals!", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "LCD died after 15 months - no extended warranty", "Author": "J.

The TVs I was looking at were the Z series Sony, Samsung 650/750, and Panasonic Plasma.  I decided not to go with the plasma since I had a lot of light in the room where the TV was going to be.  I read through a ton of reviews and decided to finally go with the xbr6 for a few reasons: one, with a ton of reviews and the consumer reports best buy, the Samsung seemed to have a lot of reliability issues that popped up.  This is my third Sony TV and I have never had a problem with any of the others over the course of 12 years. Two, the deal from Amazon was ridiculously good with the purchase of the blu-ray player.  The last was the features of the XBR6, 1080P, 120Hz, Sony video processing.Delivery: I have read, people had so-so experiences, and some bad.  My experience was excellent! I received and email with a number to call to set up the installation.  CEVA came early in the time frame they specified. They had told me in the earlier phone call that they were super busy and would only have one delivery person so I would have to help bring it in. It wasn't a huge deal for me since I was home anyway.  TV is only 60lb, so manageable for most.  Once inside, the delivery guy unboxed the TV put the TV on its stand put the screws in and plugged in to test.  Then he offered to take the box with him. Overall a great experience.  I have seen some complaints of this service but you look at FREE delivery, and no taxes vs. buying at a bigbox store and this is EXCELLENT!Picture settings:  have Dish and hooked everything up with 1.3 HDMI cables. I have the Sony BDP-S550 blu-ray player to go with it. The Blu-Ray movies look stunning to say the least.  Make sure you press the \"theater\" button to get the best image, otherwise it looks too real.  As far as the other settings, the vivid looks the best to me, but make sure you check out [...] and read about the settings for movies on cinema.  Makes a big difference especially when you turn off the light sensor.My father in-law purchased the Samsung 650 46\" and comparing side-by-side, I would say the image is very comparable, I dont like the TOC red and the glossy screen.  The Sony matte screen is much better with reflection IMHO.Sound, I LOVE IT.  I have the Yamaha 663 receiver, but the sound bar is incredible for how small it it.  The tone is good and produces excellent sound as far a TV sound goes. For movies I go with my Yamaha, but for everyday watching the sound it great.If you are looking at a great HDTV, this is the ticket, you cant go wrong.", "Date": "January 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia XBR KDL-46XBR6", "Author": "R.

The picture quality is especially noticeable on people's faces. Color and subtle shading looks perfectly natural. Not that blotchy effect you see with some TVs.  The picture quality you see in stores is often not as good as what I'm seeing with FIOS. This makes comparison shopping very difficult. So I can't make any meaningful comparisons to other brands.This TV has some slight blurring in fast action sports. I don't notice it in basketball. It is most noticeable in hockey.  Occasionally the puck will disappear momentarily on a fast slap shot. Not so on my old standard CRT TV.  But the vast improvement in overall picture quality is breathtaking.  This TV has a three position motion enhancement option (off, standard, and high).  I can't tell any significant improvement at any setting.  The fact the TV even has this option confirms there are challenges getting fast motion to look right.  But my wife doesn't notice the blurring problem.  I've never noticed any pixilation.The sound quality is very good - much better than I expected.  I have high-end speakers, but don't feel the need to bother turning them on in most cases.The brightness of the TV is great - even in my brightly lit room.  It has four picture settings that are increasingly bright (cinema, custom, standard, and vivid).  My preference is usually custom and occasionally standard.  This TV has a frosted finish on the screen that minimizes glare which was a major factor in my choosing Sony over the Samsung which has a very glossy screen.No problems with the shipment.  It was delivered ahead of schedule - even during Christmas rush - and in perfect condition.This TV went on sale right after I bought it.  Amazon politely refused to refund the price difference.

Yet, after endless research I decided to buy this Sony as our first ever flat screen t.v. and all I can say is WOW!!  I've seen HD on countless other flat screens over the years, but this set is by far the best for under $2000.  I was dead set on getting the Samsung 650 for the last 4-5 months because the image was so beautiful in every store I saw them in and it seemed like the best deal for the money (not crazy expensive, but not cheap such as other lesser known brands).  However, i was looking around in a Frye's one day and saw the Sony XBR6 on display right next to a Samsung 650 and was surprised at just how much brighter, clearer and more detailed the Sony was!  They were each running the same video loop and you could easily see that the Sony truly did have much darker blacks than the Samsung (black on all the Samsungs actually looked grey compared to Sony's, which canceled the idea of maybe the 650 just wasn't calibrated correctly).  After searching on Amazon and seeing how they were offering the set for $150 less than anywhere else along with free shipping I decided it was time to get one and I couldn't be happier.

Unfortunately, the PS3 has flickering issues with some TV's (Sony's fault, as I understand it), so I decided to \"upgrade\" to the Sony. On paper this is an awesome TV. In reality I wish I had kept my Westy.First minor gripe is that the \"Cinimotion\" feature is TERRIBLE. It makes everything look like it was shot on a handy cam. Fortunately you can turn this off.My biggest problem (and why I will never buy a Sony again) is that this TV has black bleeding problems. For example: I was watching Top Gear last night and Hammond was driving a white pickup truck across America. When the truck was standing still it looked fantastic, but when it was in motion the black wheel wells where bleeding into the white paint job. Another time this becomes a problem is when people on the screen have dark hair and light skin. When they move their head their hair blurs into their face.The effect is especially visible in video games where there are sharp lines between objects on the screen. For example: in Forza 2 the cars in front of you blur their way around corners. It is very distracting.I have tried changing virtually all of the settings to try and correct this issue. I even had a friend who owns an XBR4 come over because he thought I must have the TV set up wrong. I am technically adept and I am used to working with technology (I even have a Bachelors in computer science) so it's not like I'm just some old fart who can't figure his TV out.

I asked him for a favor to put it back in the box, and he was so rude and almost broke the boxes. I was supposed to move to a different place and that is why I asked him to put it back.

I have not played Blu Ray on this TV or hooket it up to Network but I did play Up-converted 1040i movies from my DVD player and I can tell it rocks. The TV has an Optical Out port, which in my mind is really a great connection (other TVS may have that too but never compared) as this help maintain the audio quality from the Source to the receiver.The only annoying feature of the TV so far I have noticed is that the \"Information Bar\" takes a lot of time to go away when you turn on the TV. I am talking about the information about the channel, Aspect Ration, Rating etc.. While it is up there on the screen, you can not do anything, can not click the favorites, click Input or as a matter of fact any other function on remote, you got to wait for the information bar to go away. This bar takes 1/3rd of the screen even after changing the setting to \"Small\" information. On day one the time was shorter but has become longer, I have no clue why but I am still looking in the manual but unable to find any setting. Well this is minor when you look at the quality of the picture.I gave this TV 5 rating because I think I like the TV and secondly everyone says it is the best and thirdly I spent a lot of money on this one. I guess I had to it give it the best rating.
