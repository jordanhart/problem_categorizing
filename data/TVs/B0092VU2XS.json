The setup couldn't be any easier just screw in the stand plug in your hdmi or what have you and that's it ! The picture is bright crisp and perfect I was very pleased ! The remote seems a bit generic but simple over all the bast deal I ever had on a new tv -", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sound Volume Stinks.", "Author": "UtterlyTired", "ReviewID": "R17W1MRK2PN1QS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "if you don't have a soundbar or a stereo receiver to hook this TV up to don't buy it. The sound is so bad you can barely hear it across the room with the volume turned all the way up. Other than that it's a pretty nice TV for the price.. Picture is good. Easy to use. My recommendation is spend a little bit more and get a name brand.
