{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV - But no blatant advantages over plasma", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R30V6I1ELQAFOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Little background:currently have two Plasmas in the household. I am a big fan of their picture quality, black levels, motion handling, and input lag (PS3 games).Began around three months ago searching for a larger TV, as my 50\" plasma just wasn't cutting it for me in terms of size b/c we sit 14' away from the screen. Unfortunately, my built-in entertainment center width was a major constraint. No plasma larger than 50\" could fit (the 54\" G25 Panasonic was 0.5\" too wide!!). I began to look at LEDs as they were built with thinner bezels and could thus squeeze into my entertainment center and still have a diagonal of 55\".I was very concerned with a few items when i purchased this TV:1. Picture Quality (potential) Problemsa) Flashlighting - read anywhere on Edge-lit LEDs and this is probably the #1 problem that comes up. Please note that with this TV i do NOT watch in complete darkness. Watching in complete darkness tends to exacerbate any flashlighting or clouding problems you may see in an edge-lit set. As for my set, I can definitely see some flashlighting from the corners on letterbox stuff or very dark scenes. I am looking for it though. If I had not read about flashlighting onine I probably would have never noticed. My wife thinks I am crazy. The flashlighting may go away once I get a chance to calibrate the set (I only tinkered with the settings a little) but I think either way I can live with it (and probably will forget about it in a few months)b) Black Levels - the reason i bought the 6800 instead of the 6500. The 6800 has \"Precision Dimming\", Samsung's edge-lit workaround to true full array local dimming sets. Did I buy into marketing hype or was the extra money worth the precision dimming? I can't say for sure since I never owned the 6500, but I am happy (but NOT at all wowed) with the black levels of the 6800. I felt my old Plasma black levels were better. 4:3 content or letterbox content sometimes has \"glowing\" black bars instead of inky blacks. For the most part the black levels are sufficientThe 6800 definitely has better colors and depth to it though. Certain shows look drop dead gorgeous on this TV that i never felt that way with my old TV, most likely due to the color reproduction and brighter display of this LED compared to plasma.2. Input lag for gaming - I am a HEAVY online FPS gamer (PS3). That's all I do on my PS3. COD, Killzone, etc. you name the FPS and I am playing the online multiplayer, and playing it a LOT. The \"twitchier\" the better. I've never played games on an LCD/LED TV before and have always read that LCDs/LEDs can have terrible input lag compared to Plasmas. I was extremely worried about how my gaming would be on this LED tv. I think I lost countless hours of sleep over this one, with Black Ops and Killzone 3 on the near horizon ;).  Well I am very pleased to say that with Game Mode ON, I do not notice any input lag difference from this LED from my Plasma. Modern Warfare 2 plays very snappy and fast like I am accustomed to. This was a great relief!!! With Game Mode OFF and AMP set to Clear, I could tell a little input lag but it was not anything that would get in the way of any non-FPS/Music games (i.e. any RPG players out there probably would be ok with AMP on). With Game Mode ON I did not notice any abnormal blurring or skipping of the picture...I felt everything about the game playing experience was on par with my old plasma.3. Motion Handling - read online about the Samsung LEDs and you will find many people complaining about skipping/stuttering in the picture w/ this year's version of AMP. I wont get into all the details since if you are considering this TV you probably have already read some complaints online. Watched hours of football this weekend and all the plays and scrolling ticker I could not see any skipping or stuttering. I have AMP set to \"Clear\". For movies, I have AMP set to OFF and noticed a handful of times where it skipped a frame. If I had not been looking for it I probably would have not even noticed. Motion gets an A in my book and I don't see any discernable difference from my plasmas. Blu-ray playback on my PS3 @ 24hz looks good! (AMP turned off)4. Off-Angle Viewing - i didnt think i would have an issue with this, but i surprisingly kind of do. Our kitchen and family room are kind of one huge room (open) so often when we are cooking/cleaning dishes we watch TV too. Granted, the viewing angle from the kitchen is pretty extreme (I'd put it at 20/30 degrees if 0 degrees was directly parallel to TV) but my old plasma (like all plasmas) did not lose any quality from the kitchen. This set washes out pretty badly. We obviously dont watch anything \"important\" while in the kitchen so i can live with this gripe.Conclusion:When you feed this set good material and are sitting directly in front (which for me and my wife would be 95% of the time) the picture is very good in my opinion.Aside from being 55\" (which a huge plus) and being more energy efficient, I am not sure this LED TV can top anything that Plasmas can offer (cheaper, better blacks, better uniformity, same or better PQ, etc). If my entertainment center magically widened by 2\"-3\" there is no doubt in my mind I would pack up this LED and return it immediately for a Panasonic 54\" G25,  54\" VT25, or 58\" Samsung C7000 plasma. No doubt (and I would save a lot of money too!). But given my constraints and my want for a >50\" TV, I am happy with the purchase. As more and more time passes by I am growing more and more fond of the set. It is really good looking and the picture quality most of the time is great. I hope the build quality is good and this set lasts me a while, but just in case I will get an extended warranty as well.*****************************UPDATE 11/5/10*: TV is still running well (knock on wood ;) ). I just wanted to post my PS3 settings here, just in case it helps anyone. Remember, my PS3 is via HDMI with GAME MODE ON, so any picture processing is turned off by default and can not be turned on (i.e. Auto Motion Plus is turned OFF). These settings are based off settings I've found online plus changes from using the Disney WoW calibration blu-ray.Mode: Standard (game mode forces standard)Backlight: 11Contrast: 94Brightness: 46Sharpness: 10Color: 54Tint: 50/50Eco solutions (all OFF)Color Tone: Warm2Size: Screen Fit (use 16:9 for cable tv, Screen fit for your ps3)Everything else is either OFF or Auto***************************************UPDATE 1/10/11TV is still running great (knock on wood again!). I am still very happy with my purchase.However, announced at CES just a few days ago was Panasonic's 2011 line up for Plasmas, which includes sleeker bezels and finally plasmas that come in 55\" screen size!! I am officially envious...however, not sure if Panasonic made the bezels slim enough to match my entertainment center width. Anyways, I just wanted to let everyone know that Panasonic will have 55\" Plasmas for 2011!!*********Delivery Notes:Frequent shopper here on Amazon but I've never bought anything so large or expensive online before. When I got the notice that the TV shipped using CEVA I was kind of worried, since there seems to be a lot of posts online about frustration with CEVA. First tip I kept seeing over and over is to call them right away to schedule a delivery. Very true. I ordered on a Sunday, got shipping confirmation from Amazon on Monday. Monday night CEVA's tracking system was up with the tracking number provided by Amazon. I called them first thing Tuesday morning and set up delivery for Wednesday. Very helpful and nice staff over there at CEVA. Delivery window was 9AM-1PM, however they came well after 1PM. Luckily my wife was home all day, but if I had taken time off to wait for them I would have been pretty upset that they didn't come during the window. No harm done though. My wife said the delivery men were extremely nice. I did not want them to set it up even though they offered to my wife. TV box was in pristine condition. CEVA gets an A from me.Note to TV shoppers: AVS forums are a great place to look for helpful tips. Wonderful community over there. However...I will advise that you do not spend TOO much time there, as it may make you second-guess any decision you end up making. Every TV has its ups and downs...you just have to pick your poison. In my opinion, plasmas have less \"poison\" to pick, but that's just me. Order from Amazon and you'll have a nice return window in case you dont like something. Remember, just because someone on the internet likes/dislikes something about a TV says nothing about that same thing will affect you.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Well Reasearched TV Buyer", "Author": "SJWNYC \"SJWNYC\"", "ReviewID": "R14AVKIEUZG1YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have researched every brand of TV via internet and store visit in the last 6 months and narrowed it down to Samsung.  After deciding I wasn't interested in 3D, I looked for the best 2D TV with the best Picture.  With out a question, this is the best 2D TV on the market today.  First, the out of the box plug and play was super easy.  I was expecting to calibrate the settings and had CNETs suggestions ready.  To my amazement the factory picture settings were almost spot on.  The main take away from this review is that the picture quality is really the best I've seen.  If there is only one con to this unit, like other LEDs, the picture's colors do get slightly washed out at very extreme angles.  Other than that no other issues (no corner ghosting).  Even the sound I really believe is better than average, but I will upgrade to a sound bar for that theater/sports volume needed.  Again, picture picture picture quality is amazing and you should buy this TV.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "An Absolute Beauty", "Author": "Journey Svelt \"April Tiger\"", "ReviewID": "RVWHR81BZ0HB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many other people, I purchased this TV after an extensive research on the net in addition to side-by-side comparison at Best Buy and Costco warehouse. Costco doesn't have exactly same model but it was same line with lower number, UN55C6300. This Samsung LED TV simply blew away the competition by big margin. The other LCD and LED models looked simply pale and pallid in color.I ordered this TV on July 5, 2010 and received it on July 8, 2010, just 3 days after I clicked 'Place Order.' There's no need to say it was a very prompt and fast delivery. The picture quality is just as many other people said who purchased Samsung LED TV. It's stunningly clear and so life-like. My wife and I were watching a Boston RedSox game on New England Sports Network the other day, and she commented that the game looked like being played right in front her. My living room is rather small for 55-inch TV, but I wanted a big TV as this is going to be my main TV replacing 40-inch LCD I had last couple of years. I tweaked the TV settings a little bit before I went back to factory setting, which should satisfy most of the people. I tested this TV with Avatar Blu Ray using PlayStation 3. Boy... You should see the clarity and crispiness to believe it. It was jaw-dropping experience for my whole family. After I closed my jaw, I took the Avatar Blu Ray upstairs to see it on 46-inch Samsung LCD, curious to feel the difference between LCD and LED. The difference was rather obvious. I thought LCD was clear enough. The color on LED was much brighter, more vibrant, and richer. Deep-richer... This is not 3-D, but it looked as if we were watching 3-D because of its richness in color and clarity.The sound from the TV is very impressive as well. Some people mentioned about their dissatisfaction with TV speakers, but I thought it was more than adequate and loud enough. Many times I have to turn down the volume because my daughter watches her Nickelodeon programs too loud. The only thing I am not quite happy about this TV is the remote control. It does its job but it looks a little cheap.By the way, your cable provider makes a whole lot of difference in picture quality. I have DirecTV as my satellite service. I received a number of calls from AT&T; U-verse asking me to switch to their service, and decided to check their picture quality at one of their stores in Southern California. I have to tell you, it's not quite the same. DirecTV service costs more but when it comes to picture quality there's no comparison. No matter how superb your TV is, if the source of the program is not up there, your costly investment won't quite satisfy you. Even the most expensive LED TV is not a magic box which can turn fuzzy 480p into clear 1080p.So, in conclusion, it's quite a premium to pay another $1,000 to buy this LED TV over comparable LCD model (LN55C6500), but I am glad I decided on LED purely based on its unequivocal picture quality. At least, I could pay off $2,400 over 24 months without paying a cent of interest.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful LED Tv", "Author": "Alexander Jimenez", "ReviewID": "R1GFW16SEO586J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing Tv.  After months of research on which LED 55\" I brought it down to a few choices that I was considering.  It was between the Samsung Un55C7000/Un55C8000/un55c6800 & Sony HX800.  I decided against the 7000 Samsung due to a lot of negative reviews highlighting the \"clouding\" and light peaking out of the corners of the tv.  Both the 6800 and 8000 Samsungs took care of this by Precision Dimming which the 7000 did not have.  Both of them also offered a higher contrast ratio to give you deeper blacks.  So the options were whether I wanted a 3D tv (Samsung un558000 or Sony hx800)or a similar quality non 3D LED.  Ultimately, I decided against 3D as there are less than a handful of 3D DVDs available now and the additional equipment needed was very pricey.  Better to wait some time until more options are available and price goes down.  This Samsung 6800 has been beautiful to watch, I mounted it on the wall using the Samsung Slim wall mount ($139 Amazon vs. $250 at the B store).  It looks amazing, just like a painting hanging on the wall...I would definitely recommend it to anyone if you are buying this tv with it's 1 inch thick frame you should keep highlighting it.  The wall mount only adds an extra .6 inches to it.  I was concerned that Samsungs had a glossy screen as I had a very bright room and the Sony's were Matte so less reflective.  This has been a non issue as once the tv is on there are no issues with reflecting lights, and the picture is dynamic with beautiful colors.  Blu Ray looks unbelievable on this tv.  The sound from the speakers are pretty impressive too.  To give you an idea, I usually listen to it on a 16-20 volume level and I am in a hall type room with high ceilings of 20 feet.  The max is 100 so it is more than adequate.  If you are looking at your buying options, the B store does not sell this model, instead they offer the 6900 series which is similar except an exclusive of theirs (extra apps) but really not worth the extra $ they charge, plus taxes and delivery.  Amazon had the best deal.  So all in all, I have been very happy with this Tv, it is an amazing high end LED with vivid colors and beatiful appeal.  Hope this helps for those evaluating similar options.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Great LCD TV!", "Author": "BobR52", "ReviewID": "R39MBGU8ABKC95", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the 55-6800 since the beginning of September and I love it!  First, I have to commend Amazon for their great service of providing free shipping for such a large item.  The freight company they used was great.  The driver arrived right on time--the beginning of the delivery window--and it took 6 days from the day I ordered it (Friday) until it was delivered (Thursday).  I buy a lot of things from Amazon but this was the first time I've ordered something that required freight delivery.  I thought the driver would just deliver it but he came in and opened the box, installed the stand, and made sure it worked before he left--excellent service!The picture is great.  Settings are highly configurable so if you are not happy with the way the picture looks, there are unlimited options for changing it.  I found a few suggestions online, and also used the Video Essentials disc--and eventually found the settings that work best for me and my environment.  Some have commented about the \"Soap Opera Effect\" when it comes to the Auto Motion Plus settings.  Those too are highly configurable--or you can turn it off.  I have settled on the \"clear\" setting which pretty much eliminates the effect--but some like it.  The Precise Dimming seems to work great as well and is also configurable under the \"Smart LED\" setting.  Some have commented about \"flashing\" where light evidently shows at the edges of dark scenes. This model doesn't exhibit any flashing--at least not my TV anyway.  During a perfectly black scene, the whole screen is black--no extraneous light anywhere.  The blacks are very black--as black as the frame around the TV.The online apps work as advertised as well.  I also have a Samsung Blu Ray Player (6500) and use that for Netflix streaming but I have used Pandora and Amazon on Demand with the TV and it works fine.  I'm  not sure why Amazon is not a Blu Ray app but apparently it isn't on that model anyway.  The Blu Ray provides integration with my A-V receiver--the TV doesn't--so I prefer to use the Blu Ray player.  But it is nice to have the apps on the TV as well.This model (along with the 6900 which is essentially identical to this one) is the top of the line Samsung that is not 3D.  It has two top end features that are not found together on any other non-3D set--Precise Dimming and 120 hrz refresh.  So this for me was the TV to get since I don't want 3D.

I had read countless reviews and went to see endless models based on price, picture and manufactures. I'm a Sony man and found that they just couldn't come up to the Samsung for some reason. I wanted to purchase the Sony XBR8 but they discontinued them. So after long hours of hand twisting I went to Samsung. So far I've been pleasantly surprised. The picture is just great and sometimes is just beautiful. The speaker system has much to be desired but I just run the surround sound if I'm watching something of value. The app's are ok if you need them but working them through the remote has to go. I stream Netflex through the blueray player so the TV side of the app's isn't necessary (but I did run lines to the ethernet connections, didn't bother running wireless). I bought this through Amazon and I did pay a few dollars more BUT they offered a 30 day return policy if it came DOA or I didn't like it over the period. I was very concerned about SHIPPING it.... at times I thought I must be crazy, BUT I tracked it from PA to a warehouse at JFK and then to my house. I looked in the truck when it arrived and there was 12 others waiting to be delivered. It seems that the shipping worry was a non issue.

Just like many other reviewers I did lots of research and read many reviews on many brands of LCD/LED TVs.  I narrowed my research to rule out both 3D and Plasma displays.  There is not enough 3D content to warrant the purchase of the equipment and I wear glasses so I don't like wearing glasses over glasses.  In addition I have read that LCD/LED TVs are projected to have a longer lifespan than Plasma displays.Of course not everything is so cut and dry.  Every display technology has it's advantages and disadvantages.  Plasma displays have an excellent reputation and you would not go wrong if you did your research and chose the best Plasma that you could afford.I chose the Samsung 55\" UN55C6800 because it seemed to be the best of the best non 3D LCD/LED TVs with local dimming.  Many of the top of the line 3D TVs have local dimming but not so much with non 3D TVs.  This one does.The picture quality is outstanding!  Absolutely jaw dropping!!  This TV is second to none!

ECO Sensor - I turned to OFFI had read so many negative reviews regarding \"Auto Motion Plus\" that it was the first change that I made.  The reviews stated that with it on the display image looked cheezey, amateurish, and video like when there was motion.  This was the consensus of many of the major reviewers on websites like Home Theater magazine, ZDNet, etc.With \"ECO Sensor\" switched to \"ON\" the display brightness changes depending on the surrounding light intensity.  In other words when you dim the lights or turn out the lights in the room where your TV is located, the display image dims as well.  This is a power saving feature.  This feature may indeed decrease the power and save money on the electric bill but IMHO it also decreases the picture quality and too no small degree.All things considered I rate this TV 5 stars!", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung C6400/C6300 vs Samsung C6900/C6800 vs Bravia EX710/EX711", "Author": "Matt P", "ReviewID": "R1H9XHW0IC1KGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent weeks researching and testing various LCD/LED flat screens.  In the end I purchased the Samsung 55 inch C6400.  The C6400 model is the same screen as the C6300 model except the C6400 has Samsung's built-in internet apps whereas the C6300 does not.  In the process, I purchased two Samsungs (C6400 and C6900) and one Sony Bravia (EX711).  Here is what I learned: * All of the review websites \"calibrate\" their screens before performing a review.  During calibration the screen's default settings are changed to supposedly make them more accurate.  Nifty features that are built into the screen like \"Mega Dynamic Contrast Ratio\" are frequently disabled during calibration because they can affect the accuracy of the image.  In my opinion, if a nifty feature in your television can make it appear brighter or more colorful, go for it.  Color accuracy is overrated.  What matters is whether *you* like the picture or not. * Edge-lit screens like the Samsungs and Bravia I reviewed are thinner, lighter, and more eco-friendly than the full-array screens.  In theory full-array screens give better contrast ratios, and require less picture manipulation to achieve said contrast ratios.  To my untrained eyes, it's hard to see a difference. * Dynamic edge-lit on the C6900 sounds like a good idea, but in my testing it created some weird affects that my wife, in particular, didn't care for where some parts of a dark image were pitch black and other parts of the same dark image were a brighter black, giving the appearance that someone turned on a spotlight down part of the screen. * The blacks were darker on the C6400 than the C6900.  Go figure. * Edge-lit screens tend to hide the speakers on the back of the set.  This produces a \"reflected\" sound that is decent, but not the best.  We planned to purchase a theater system with our television so this didn't really matter to us. * The Samsungs and Bravia screens came with a swivel stand.  This was important for our living room set up. * None of the Samsungs supported HDMI Auto Return Channel.  Without ARC I have to power on the screen *and* the theater system to watch video from external devices like a blue ray player or game console.  Not a big deal but it occasionally frustrates.  The Bravia fully supported HDMI Audio Return Channel. * When using motion blur reduction, the Samsungs have A/V sync issues in combination with our theater system.  I have addressed this by increasing the audio delay in our theater system.  It's not exactly perfect but it gets lip sync close enough that no one (except myself of course) ever notices it. * All of the Samsung screens exhibited corner lighting and flashlighting to some degree.  Each Samsung screen was slightly different.  To see this, put the screen in Movie mode and view a uniform dark image in a pitch black room.  You should see that the screen is slightly brighter in the corners and certain areas of the screen are also brighter (flashlighting).  At first this really bothered me, but then I got used to it.  There's simply no way you're going to notice this where it matters most: where the movie picture is playing.  You'll only ever see it in a darkened room between scenes and around the edges where the movie isn't playing. * Amazingly the Bravia didn't have *any* corner lighting or flashlighting.  I don't know how Sony pulled that off, but I was impressed.  Samsung should license Sony's edge lighting technology. * The Samsungs all have a reflective screen which produces a really sharp and bright image that seems to pop off the screen.  The Bravia uses a matte screen.  I was baffled to observe that the Samsungs all handled reflections much better than the Bravia.  There is a window directly behind our viewing sofa.  With the Samsungs you were hard pressed to even see a reflection at all during daytime viewing.  With the Bravia, the television was almost unwatchable during daylight hours.  Reflections caused a blooming halo affect that was really dramatic.  Score one for Samsung's \"Ultra Clear Panel\" technology. * All the Samsungs handled SD content really well.  SD content on the Bravia looked bad in comparison. * The Bravia screen frequently exhibited really noisy colors, particularly with skin tones.  This was much less of an issue with 1080p content, but was really annoying at times.  The Samsungs never had this problem. * The Samsungs use a remote control that is relatively simple and is backlit.  My wife and kids had no issues picking it up and using it right away.  The Bravia remote control was significantly more complicated and was not backlit. * All the Samsungs employ mediocre motion blur reduction.  Motion blur reduction helps minimize the stuttering affect during movement - especially panning shots.  The problem is that unless it is set to Off or Clear, the Samsungs occasionally stuttered.  In practice this isn't a problem as I actually prefer the Clear setting, but sometimes I want to dial this setting up for animated feature films (Cars, Toy Story, etc.) and it often doesn't work out well. * The Bravia had kick-but motion blur reduction.  I was really impressed.  Everything was smooth and fluid.  This may have been in part due to Sony's \"True Cinema\" technology. * When I originally started out, I really wanted our new television to provide Netflix playback and DLNA media streaming.  Despite what is advertised, Samsung's Netflix and DLNA support is poor.  On both Samsungs, Netflix was constantly switching bitrates (about once a minute) and each time the picture disappear to black for about a quarter of a second.  Audio was unaffected.  I repeatedly took the exact same network cable and plugged it into other devices (PS3, Roku, Laptop) and Netflix playback was flawless HD.  Samsung reportedly insists the problem is the user's internet service. * None of the Samsungs or the Bravia I tested would connect to my DLNA server.  I have approximately five streaming devices (Logitech music box, No-name streaming box, iPad, PS3, etc.) spread throughout my home and none have had any issue connecting to my DLNA server. * The Bravia did have better Netflix support, however overall bitrate was still less than other devices (PS3, Roku, Laptop).  A few video stalls (buffering) were experienced on the Bravia. * In my opinion, the C6400 isn't worth the extra cost over the C6300.  In my case I got a super deal on the C6400 so it wasn't an issue.  Perhaps in another few years, these issues will get ironed out.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice TV - Then Why 3 Stars", "Author": "A.

Sharp picture,great color, slim design etc. This may be a great TV for some people and I can see why, so I won't dwell on that.The only negitive I have found is1 A very narrow viewing angle, The picture starts getting hazzy/white when moving left or right of the TV. Although we mostly watch it from the front, sometimes need to take a peak from the kitchen and it's a poor picture. -1 Star2 The shine on the forehead of the news reader or anyone else on TV may look like a very bright white spot (instead of a shiny spot) This can be corrected by reducing brightness, backlight or contrast but may weaken the picture for other seens. -1 Star3 The Glossy screen reflects everything in front of it like a mirror. So if you have a window, lamp or any other bright object, then you are certain to see it while watching TV. This is an issue in many new sets trying to improve \"black tones\" but I have seen a sony model with non-gloss grey screen.Despite an exceptionaly sharp (sometime too clear) picture and smooth motion, the 2 issues give it a 3 star in my opinion. If these  problems are not any issue for you then it's a great unit whith the following Pros:- Great Picture, I mean it's so clear that movies like brave heart or Les Mis look like you're there on set viewing the shooting. When turing off features like \"edge enhancement\" and \"LED Motion Plus\" it brings us back in time when the world wasn't as clear.- Loud Sound, Many LED TVs only have 10watt x2 Speakers and may be weak for some situations.

After much research as to what I wanted, I decided on this model from Samsung and pre-ordered.  I also added new Samsung components to make a complete package.  Here is how my SYSTEM is set up:Samsung UN55C6800 TVSamsung BD-C6500 Blu-Ray Dics PlayerSamsung HW-C700 AV ReceiverAPC AV H10 BLK Power Filter and ConditionerDirectv HD DVR ReceiverThis is the first time I ordered something large and expensive like this on Amazon.  I was very well satisfied with the service we received from CEVA Logistics.  I received a tracking number and was able to track the shipment.  As with others that have reported, I had to call the local CEVA office to set up a shipping date after it was there a few days and no call.  The TV was delivered by two people and brought into the house and set up, and they left the packaging in case it would need to be shipped back.  Very good service and they showed up when they told us they would.Connection was very easy using HDMI Cables and optical cables.Having used the Samsung TV for close to 7 months now, I have been very happy with my purchase.  I will not go into great detail as other reviewers just the highlights.The black levels look great in my non-professional opinion.  The adaptive dimming appears to be working and meets my expectations.The colors are fantastic and resolution is beautiful. I feel they look better than other brands of LED TVs my friends own.I have not seen any issues with the 120 Hz speed and always see smooth pictures on the sports channels, action movies and other high speed video.The extras on this TV have come to be more important than I expected.  In particular, I use the USB port a lot.  Grab your memory stick with photos or videos on it and the TV works perfectly to view on screen.  I was totally impressed.I use the Blu-ray player for any wireless network functions like the internet or access to photo and video folders on my PC.  I can not wire a Cat-5 cable to my TV at its location so I must use the Blu-Ray Players wireless functions which are almost identical.Negatives:I think the look could be better.  The metal stand I feel is a little too retro if you have to use it like I do.The Anynet function that communicates with your TV, DVD and AV Receiver is a joke, but I knew that before I bought it.  If I turn on the DVD, the TV will turn on and go to the DVD input properly, but the AV receiver will not.  If I turn off the TV it turns off all the components properly.  If I turn on the receiver, it will not turn on anything else.  I am constantly juggling remotes.This TV needs to have wireless networking.  Most people cannot run cable from their internet modem to the TV.Overall I give this TV 5 stars, because the negatives are not enough to bring it down a star and I am very happy with everything else this TV offers.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Is the New Sony", "Author": "Rational \"Sensible\"", "ReviewID": "RNTBK41EIYWAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For decades Sony TV's were the technology to beat.

Kim", "ReviewID": "R2KX43LK49M831", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this set about 4 months ago. It replaced a 40 inch Samsung LCD set that was getting long in the tooth (720p). I needed to get something that would really take advantage of all the new tech I was using (PS3, HTPC, etc). I decided I did not want to venture into 3D (Am I the only one who does NOT think sitting or lying on my couch with 3D goggles over my eyeglasses is fun?). So this set was the one I set my eye on. It's pretty much the best non-3D set Samsung makes and it has the dynamic lighting that I really wanted.First off, the delivery schedule from Amazon was dead on. They were at my door at 4:01PM (delivery window of 4-6PM). The TV itself is incredibly thin and light. It actually weighed less than the 40\" LCD it was replacing. Being a big burly man, LOL, I was able to mount the unit on the wall bracket by myself. I did not use the flat wall mount kit as I wanted to angle it a little bit. Once mounted, I realized that this TV is ridiculously thin! It looked like a picture frame on my wall, even with tilt-able brackets which placed it about a 2 inch gap from the wall.With all the wires connected, I fired her up. The first thing I noticed was that the screen is glossy. With all the lights turned up in the theater room, reflections were visible during completely dark scenes (the tilting brackets alleviated this tremendously). The next thing I noticed was that the screen image was BRIGHT! The factory defaults could burn a hole in your retinas... don't even think of clicking on the DEMO mode... I scoured the internet for calibration settings and after about an hour of fiddling with the picture settings, I found a combination that was extremely pleasing to my eyes. The blacks are ridiculously dark (my plasma owning friends even commented... now that's impressive) and the auto dimming backlight helps out tremendously. It made me realize that all the blacks on my old TV were really just a grayish tint. One thing about the picture that I did not like was the off-axis viewing. The color does wash out extremely quickly, I would say about 20 degrees off to either side results in some pretty serious color shift, but I never watch TV sitting off to one side. I notice it more when I'm running into the room to sit on the sofa. It is something to keep in mind when thinking about this set.The heat output, or lack thereof, is pretty awesome. My friend's plasma can double as a furnace. My old LCD also got pretty warm around the back and top. This thing barely even registers. The back panel remained cool to the touch even after the set had been on for 2 days straight! And did I mention it looks so beautiful hanging on my wall?I have all the audio pumping through my home theater so I can't really comment on the set's speakers, however, the few minutes I listened to them it seemed what you would expect from a TV that is 1\" thin. Vocals were pretty clear, but no top end and definitely no bass at all. That being said, the volume can be cracked up damn high with no discernible distortion.The internet function was something I was interested in exploring (I have a HTPC which I mainly use but I wanted to see what Samsung was offering). The Netflix app is lacking which really disappointed me. It only allows you to watch shows in your instant queue. There is absolutely no searching outside of these selections. If I had purchased this set with Netflix viewing in mind, I would have been very disappointed. that being said, the picture and streaming was extremely quick and excellent quality with most of my selections coming in HD. (I connected via wired Ethernet, there is an optional wireless dongle you can purchase).Getting back to the picture calibration... I can't stress enough how important this is. If you just keep it at the default settings, the picture quality will suck. Plain and simple. It's too bright, with all these digital compensation artifacts, and the colors are all wrong. Doing a simple internet search will get you some good setting to start off with. Then put in a calibration DVD or one of your favorite movies and begin adjusting away until you find something that looks good to you. This way you get those amazingly dark blacks. I'm also not a fan of the \"smoothing\" effect (that soap opera look, I personally don't know why people like this... I want a movie to look like a movie...) so I turned it off permanently. There are complaints of the video stuttering a times with this option turned on so be aware.I hope to be enjoying this TV set for many many years to come.

Solano", "ReviewID": "R3QDX6N07SN7FH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most of the people on here, I'd done plenty of research for the past couple months, almost to the point of getting overwhelmed and not pulling the trigger on a new TV. The problem is that no matter which TV you're looking into, people will love it, others will hate it, and there will be plenty of opinions somewhere in between.I knew from my experience working at Best Buy that I wanted to stick with Samsung. For me, they seemed to have the best quality picture all around, and the word on the street was that they were becoming the best choice overall. Initially, I thought I would be getting a plasma. You can save a significant amount of money for TV's of the same size. However, once I went in to a couple stores, I knew I had to go with LED(edge-lit or full-array, of course, I understand they're not really LED TV's. I also made the jump to 55\" from my original thought of 46\" or 50\" plasma. I would like to keep my TV for as long as I can, and preventing that \"We could go bigger\" feeling as long as possible is a big plus.I finally decided on this TV and watched the prices closely. Amazon had the best sub-2k price so I went for it. The order was made on a Thursday night, and the TV arrived Monday morning via CEVA. I was not there for the actual delivery, but from what my brother tells me: The person was very professional, apparently each TV in the truck has it's own compartment so it doesn't bounce around. He took the TV out of the box, set it up on the stand (not the mount, just the included stand, which is all I needed anyways), and even let my brother connect the PS3 and speakers before checking that it worked.When I finally arrived home, I nearly s!@# myself and couldn't get the smile off my face. I remember the first thing I'd said was \"Now that's a freakin TV!!!\" Compared to the Westinghouse 32\" LCD I had been using prior, I was completely relieved of all doubt that buying a new TV was the right thing to do. Everything looked amazing, picture and styling, and I was just blown away. I also couldn't get over the size, while it is huge compared to my previous TV's, it really is perfect for my living room (12' x 18') and I wouldn't go an bigger or smaller.Now that I've had the TV for 3 weeks, and was able to fully enjoy it during the holidays, I felt it was time to write a realistic review. I've never done one of these so I'm not going to break it out into sections and stuff. I'm just going to say it like it is.First off, let me just get my overall feelings of the TV out of the way. I absolutely love it! I now understand how home theater viewings are meant to be. Combined with my 5.1 system that I've loved for years, I couldn't be happier.As far as the Picture Quality goes, it's phenomenal. I've never seen such fine detail in a TV even at closer distances. The color out of the box was great but I had to fool around with it. I used some settings I had found online for the C8000 but, at least in my home, that appeared to make things worse. I ended up spending 45 minutes to an hour going through and tweaking everything to my liking and now I think it's perfect, at least from straight on. Which leads me to my next point.While the colors are bright and vivid, the best seat in the house is definitely straight on. Watch this TV from a 45 degree angle and the picture is still excellent and top-notch, but compared to straight-on it's a bit off. View the TV from a 60 - 80 degree angle and saturation/contrast almost go out the window. This doesn't bother me as much as it sounds or would be expected. The only time I view it from harsh angles would be when I'm in the kitchen and want to glance at the action, or when you get the b@#$% seat on my couch which is about 3.5' away from the screen, almost directly to it's side. At that point, everything looks kind of pinkish.But honestly, if you're viewing this TV the way it's meant to be viewed, I don't think there's a better picture out there. I can't see how spending even 1k - 3k more on a top-end TV could improve things.There is a fairly large quality gap when it comes to viewing HD and SD content. As expected and inferred, this baby handles HD like a champ. Completely jaw-dropping! So I don't feel I have to say anything more on that. The flip side is that because this TV is so large, it really has to stretch the pixels of SD content to fit the screen. It's not too much of a problem, but it definitely makes you wish they used an HD camera or upgraded their service or whatnot.I agree with most that the Auto Motion Plus should be turned off. I thought I might like it, after being exposed to it in Best Buy, but when watching some of my favorite films or tv shows, it kind of ruined the experience. It really does look like they shot it with video and I now understand why you want a bit of blur for that 'Movie Look' or 'Film look. I played around with the different settings that they have for it and ended up just turning it off all together.What may be a plus or minus for others is the fact that they allow you to have different picture settings for the different inputs. This also translates to being forced to calibrate the picture all over again for every device you connect. This was a real pain in the butt at first, but I'm over it now.The Samsung Apps are a nice touch. While my PS3 already runs Hulu Plus and Netflix, sometimes it's just easier to access them right from the TV. It also looks like they're updating constantly. I recently looked at the selection and was surprised to see almost 15 or 20 new apps since I first set up the TV. They've got the usual stuff like Weather and News, but also Pandora, Napster, Vudu, Facebook, Youtube, a bunch of games which I haven't tried, etc. So it's pretty cool in my opinion. The TV is not Wireless on it's own. But while you can connect it to an Ethernet cable, Amazon bundled the Wireless Adapter for free with purchase. Sweet!I've heard some complaints about the speakers and I have to disagree. It's obviously not as bassy as my 10\" sub, and they don't give you the surround sound experience when watching movies, but as for general viewing they are A-O-K in my book. They're pretty clear for TV speakers and at normal volumes I sometimes can't distinguish between the built in speakers and my surround set up.I can be an avid gamer from time to time and I love that I can now play Call of Duty while sitting a healthy distance from my TV. Before, I felt I would have to pull a chair up to about 4'-5' from the front of my own screen to be at the top of my game. I'm now much further back and while the tv is obviously larger, it presents the colors and details so much better that I'm still pulled into the game. I haven't felt the need to put the TV in GAME mode as I haven't experienced any of the mentioned lag and am happy with the settings I'd put in initiallyI know this writeup has been long and wordy, but I just wanted to get everything out there. Is the TV 100% perfect? No. But is there really a perfect TV out there? I doubt it. For this price, I don't know how much better it can get. The picture will blow you away. I'm serious. I still can't get over it. Even when I thought people were hyping it up too much I am now doing the same thing. The TV is very thin and sleek looking. and with good care, I believe I will enjoy this TV for a long time watching movies as the were meant to be watched, playing videogames as if I were in them, and viewing sports games like I was attending the event.As I said in the title, I'm so relieved that I've made the right purchase!UPDATE: One thing I forgot to mention, partly because once I fixed it I forgot about it, is the Eco Settings. What this supposedly allows the TV to do is adjust it's brightness based upon the ambient light in the room. This is to save your eyes and your electricity bill. However, when first viewing the TV, I kept wondering why one Earth the picture was so dim. And then, moments later, I'd realize the picture was a lot bright and nothing was wrong with it. I finally remember someone mentioning this Eco setting, so I wen t in and turned it off, and all was fixed.From my observations, the Eco sensor is too sensitive and the changes too harsh. I believe the TV only has the ability to go from full brightness, to completely dimmed out, and nothing in between. And if you're not getting full direct sunlight into your room, the TV goes dim. There are a couple tweaks in the Eco Settings part of the menu, but I just ended up turning it off. Once again, I don't really hold it against the TV, because it's an easy fix.

When they mention \"LED\" they are talking about the backlighting - not the pixels themselves (although I believe \"true\" LED displays will become cheaper and more popular in the future).  In a so-called LED TV, LEDs replace the flourescent tube backlights that have been used in most LCD TVs in the past.  The advantages of the LED backlight are: (1) lower energy consumption; (2) better long term reliability; (3) allows a thinner TV; and (4) allows backlighting to be dynamically controlled and turned on/off for individual pixels in some other TVs, or at least for regions of the display like in this TV set.  This fourth feature allows this TV to achieve better contrast ratios and blacker-blacks than conventionally-backlit LCD TVs.  And contrast and black levels have alwasys been drawbacks of LCD TVs compared to plasma.  This LCD TV can achieve a very high contrast ratio and can produce deep blacks.This TV is also very thin, light for its size, and produces an excellent quality picture. I mounted this TV from the ceiling in our family room, which can have a lot of ambient light during the day, and this TV produces a picture that is plenty bright enough for this application, whereas a plasma TV would be too dim.  There is also no glare or reflections from this TV.You do need to take some time to calibrate the picture - the factory settings are designed for a bright \"big box store\" floor and therefore are way too bright and will NOT look good in your house.  It will look like everything was produced with a cheap camcorder.  Also, you will probably want to turn \"auto motion\" off.This TV has a ton of features - more than I will probably ever use.  The user manual can be a bit initimidating.  There are only two things I would add.  First, I wish there was a simple way via the remote control - without wading through menus - to toggle on and off picture-in-picture and to switch back-and-forth between the two pictures.  Maybe some more expensive models offer this (?).  Second, I wish it included a built-in WiFi receiver instead of the $75 USB dongle, and I wish that the WiFi operated at higher speeds.  Again, maybe some more expensive models have better WiFi capabilities.This is not what I would choose for a basement, \"man-cave,\" or home theater project.  For those applications, with a really dark room, I would look at front or rear projection, and maybe even plasma.  And there are better LCD TVs than this one - but generally they will cost a lot more money.

The 6800 model has what is called \"Precision Dimming\" and for some reason, Samsung's website does say how the 6800 differs from the 6500. The 6800 breaks the led's up into segments and dims parts of the tv where it should be dark and keeps bright areas bright. It truly is amazing and you won't find the 6800 being sold by amazing, only through it's partner and you won't find it in stores. Perhaps the reason is, is that it will confuse the consumer? I don't know.I've combined the 6800 with Apple's iTv because the Samsung apps and password set up is the best. It's a good start, but needs plenty of work. Both the apple itv and samsung have iphone and ipad Apps which is an added bonus especially when a keyboard is required.Also, I've purchased Amazon's HDMI cables and have had no problem - the price for amazon's cables are so low and there is no reason to pay more - they are as good as any with no picture loss.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "John V.

I think Samsung has beaten the pants off SONY on this one.I have been a loyal SONY customer for many years, but this Christmas, I debated between Samsung and VIZIO.I am glad I bought the Samsung.What I Liked:- The picture quality. Wooooow! This is nothing short of spectacular! The blacks are blacks, the whites are whites...  I suggest doing a comparison test by playing David Attenborough's \"Life\" or \"Planet Earth\" in 1080p mode. The difference with VIZIO, LG, SONY, any plasma (including Samsung) is as clear as comparing a CD to an LP!- The swivel feature! YESSSSS!!! Now your TV does not have to be perfectly square with the room and the couch.- The sound is also quite adequate, but you may be well advised to hook it up to a true surround sound system if you have one.- The LAN port.  I like options and would not like to be restricted to one wireless interface.- The auto input select feature/auto power on/off (turning on the Blu-Ray player will automatically power on the TV and vice-versa).- The Samsung Apps (at least as far as the VOD apps go).  I use NetFlix \"on-demand\" all the time, and it works quite well...- The price! Amazon was atleast $200 less than other on-line vendors (e.g., ONE-CALL) and warehouses (e.g., COSTCO)- The hierarchy of the menus, on-screen displays, tools, etc.- Delivery and damage verification upon deliveryWhat Could Be Better:- The remote. Albeit being a no-nonsense, lighted remote, I noticed that not the buttons are back-lit... and it is not as ergonomic as that of the SONY.- The manuals (but, who reads them, anyway?) :)What I Really Disliked:- The inputs. Yes, it is great that it has 4 HDMI inputs, but it has ONLY ONE Component input.  And the RCA connectors are conspicuous by their absence!  But I guess you can make up for it by using the \"picture size\" functionOne word of advice - do not buy the wireless adapter... Not worth it.

Davis", "ReviewID": "R1RNBFUZX98QK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, this is a great TV.The picture is vibrant, clear, and detailed.  The colors are bright and don't bleed across the screen.  There are enough picture controls on the menu to satisfy just about everyone.  This model has the precision dimming LED back-lighting, which gives greater contrast and deeper blacks than the other models.  Yes, there is an unevenness in the back-lighting if you have a bright object in the center of the screen surrounded by black, but for normal viewing, it isn't really noticeable.  For us, it shows up the most when loading Netflix videos where the \"loading...\" shows up in bright white centered on a black background.  For dark scenes in movies, the contrast isn't that high, and unevenness in the back-lighting isn't noticeable.  For normal TV or sports, you can't even tell precision dimming is being used.  We would definitely choose this model over the other models without the precision dimming.The menus are good, but there are a lot of them.  They give you great flexibility in adjusting the picture, sound, and just about everything else.  The good part is they are well organized and most of them you only need to bother with once.One downside for us was this model only has one composite/component video input.  This means all our video equipment without HDMI has to share this one connection.  A small gripe, since we'll eventually update the rest of the electronics, but annoying for the time being.Also, the audio out doesn't vary with the volume on the TV; it's basically a \"line-out\" connection with constant output.  Our prior TV varied the volume on the output, so we could set the amplifier to a comfortable level, and change the TV volume with the TV remote.  For now, we just use the internal TV speakers.  We lose audio quality but don't have to hassle with another remote.Bottom line:  great TV, well worth the price.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "Kent D.

Pros and Cons for all the makes, models, etc.  We chose UN55c6800 by Samsung, since it had the best Picture Quality (IMHO) and overall best reviews and ratings on many sites and even B&M; Stores.Cons:  The stand is very cheap (the part that attaches the Stand to the TV is cheap), it makes the TV Wabble if you touch it.  We have ours sitting on a nice TV Console.  It is not as light as people say it is.It also has limited instructions on setting it up, etc.  For someone like my wife and I, who are not that TV Tech Savvy, it was somewhat hard setting it up.  For example, if you by accident choose \"Store Demo\" mode during initial setup, the instructions to get it back to \"Home Use\" do not work and are incomplete.  I called Samsung Tech Support and they walked me through on how to get it to \"Home Use\" Mode again, and it was totally different then what was written in the User Manual.Not enough component slots in the back.  We hooked up for AT&T; Uverse HD-DVR with 5 components cables, and that took up all the slots.  I was not able to hook up our WII, or DVD player.  I will get a HDMI cable for the AT&T; box, which will free up those slots, but still there should be more.Pros:  Definitely a great picture.  This is comparing to a OLD KLH 27\" CRT TV we had before this.  We are highly impressed so far with the TV picture quality.  Still trying to figure out all the settings that are best for our viewing.  Like Auto Motion PLus being off, etc.I do like the Precision Dimming feature, works very well.The sound quality is also very nice, and we do not have a Home Theatre system set up yet.The delivery was prompt and fast from Amazon.  I ordered it on a Saturday afternoon, and I got it delivered on Monday Afternoon (in 2 days).  The Pilot delivery guy was nice, but I had to help him carry it in and open it up.  We checked for any damage, and that was it, he left.  He did not help set it up.I have yet to hook it up to our home network.  I orderd a Samsung Wifi Linkstick, so once I get that I will hook up wireless on the TV and try the APPS.I am sure the picture quality will improve once I get HDMI Cables for our AT&T; Box, get a Blu-ray player and order HD tv from our Provider.

After being a plasma TV user for 3 years, I thought I'd give the new LED a try because I've been hearing all these good things about this new LED picture quality. What I noticed and didn't like about the LED UN55C6800 is that the TV is TOO BRIGHT, and strains my eyes upon viewing. I can lower the LED back-lighting, but then the picture quality suffers (lower contrast ratio = less colors available). Another thing I noticed and did not like was the response time (lag), they do not tell us or advertise the response time of LCD or LED TVs because it is inferior to plasma TVs (FACT!). For example, when I viewed TV shows or movies on this, the audio was not synced to the video (the video was lagging behind the audio). This is extremely noticeable when you have people on screen speaking with their lips closed and eventually ending with their lips moving, but no dialogue. Even my plasma from 3 years ago had a better response time than this new LED UN55C6800 I've just received. Again, I am dissatisfied, but the list doesn't end here. And because of this inferior response rate, we get what you would call \"motion blur\" on these LED/LCD TVs. Another issue with the LED UN55C6800 is the image artifacts that the TV produces under fast motioned picture. For example, when viewing sports or playing video games, when an object on the screen moves quickly across the screen, it leaves behind a trail of gray outlining (this is due to the slow responding shifts of the liquid crystals). Turning on the 120hz Auto Motion Plus doesn't help either (it's a marketing scam). Since everything is broadcast in 60hz (60 frames per sec), the 120hz AMP fails to reduce motion blur or image artifacts and only makes it worse because the TV just plays the same frame TWICE, causing a flickering effect. To top that off, the blacks and the dark images appear horrendous on screen. When I tested out a dark movie on this LED TV, I couldn't get any detail out of the dark scenes. Its as if dark objects are close to being uniformly black. While even on my 3 year old plasma, I could get way better contrasting black levels.Buy this TV if you're willing to ignore all these issues.If not, you should check out Samsung's 58 inch Plasma: http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-PN58C6500-58-Inch-1080p-Plasma/dp/B0036WT406/ref=sr_1_4?m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&s;=tv&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1295600308&sr;=1-4I do not recommend the Samsung LED UN55C6800. Instead, get the Samsung Plasma PN58C6500 because the only issue you have to deal with is the slight image retention. And you don't have to worry about burn-in images anymore because plasma technology has improved.I plan on returning my Samsung LED UN55C6800 soon and getting the Samsung Plasma PN58C6500.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "IPTV feature doesn't work", "Author": "Puzzle", "ReviewID": "R3S0RV1V1EBX64", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Tried IPTV and Samsung Apps.
