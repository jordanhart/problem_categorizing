{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great multi-task TV", "Author": "D. Yerukhimov", "ReviewID": "REBWTOP16JJ7D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to be used as a desktop monitor, cable television, and ps3 720p hd tv for my apartment in College. The unit came fully assembled with base attached so its a go right out of the box. First... as a computer screen with my sony VAIO this thing is amazing! Crisp and bright with a max resolution of 1440 x 900. It is true plug and play aswell with a direct VGA to VGA connection so as a computer screen this is absolutley great. Next, as a tv this unit is also good. Channel surfing is slow but the audio is nice and loud and clear (with a cable connection) and the tuner picks up all available channels and holds them tight. Next, as a HDTV the picture quality blew me away. I use my PS3 to play blu-ray movies and play COD4 in 720p on the monitor and it is perfect. I have a 1000bpms monster HDMI cable (highly recommended when connecting hd devices)that i used to connect my ps3 to my SONY BRAVIA 32inch 1080p back home so i know everything is running at optimum level with this screen. The only disappointment is the voices of people when playing dvd/blu-ray movies. Sitting back 8 ft from the screen with volume at 90% you can barely hear any spoken word which is strange because when switched to TV input, the volume needs not to be past 10% to hear spoken word a clear 15ft away... I plan on solving the HD sound quality problem with a 5.1 logitech surround sound system while in the mean time i use full headphones when watching movies. Other minor draw backs include crappy remote build quality and COMPLETLEY stationary base ( no tilt or anything ). The non tilt is not a big problem as this tv has AMAZING view from pretty extreme angles. So all and all for this price... this TV is great if you can live with or solve the poor spoken word with dvd/hd movies.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great LCD", "Author": "P.

The sound is awful, sounds like you are in a large metal room. But, you can make personal adjustments to make it sound better. I turned up the bass and set the treble to zero, sounds better now. It also has it's preset settings for movie, music, standard and sports you can try one of these, sound might be better. The sound is better if you are playing a DVD that is in stereo.The turner is slow on most channels. Change a channel and wait about 1- 4 seconds before the pictures comes up. If you want to change inputs from the screen selection, you better be fast on the remote, you only have about 2 seconds before the input selection screen goes away. The color is not that great either. My input is coming from the coax from my digital cable supplier. Just regular channels, no HD. The picture is much better when watching a DVD. I'm using the Red - Blue - Green inputs.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "A. Schuh", "ReviewID": "R21QPD6JQ7XYF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Always been a big fan of ViewSonic.  I bought this TV with the purpose of using it as a TV as well as a pc monitor.  I'm using a HDMI connection and a Nvidea 8600 video card.  The computer adjusted to the screen size.  Using a wide screen vs two monitors is amazing.  I have so much desktop space.  And it uses very little space on my actual desk.  It can be mounted to a wall.  This I plan to do later.  Quality is as great as always.  This is replacing my view sonic monitor I bought 8 years ago.  And bluray on this baby... just brings tears to your eyes.  Excellent buy!", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poorly exicuted", "Author": "holson", "ReviewID": "R13Y9YT2SKCZV6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Along with poor audio, the TV would not tune any QAM channels, the picture was flat and adjustments were minimal.

The worst sounding TV I ever heard.  Sounds like it's coming out of a tin can.  I can't believe the manufacture would sell a TV like this.  Just returned it to Amazon and will buy something else.  Pictures good, not outstanding.", "Date": "October 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Too many rough edges", "Author": "fredf888", "ReviewID": "R1JT1GLQ3OBYQH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This TV is definitely below average in every way.  It is clear ViewSonic intends to cut cost wherever possible.  The screen cannot be tilted.  Thus, if you setup your TV high up on a shelf, the screen dims considerably because of the viewing angle.  The electronics of this set is SLOW.  You soon realize that when it takes perhaps 5 minutes to autoscan the available channels.  When you use the up and down buttons to change channels, the tuner \"waits\" for half a second, then the screen blanks for another half a second before the new channel pops up on the screen.  If you like to flip through the channels, this set will frustrate you.  The speakers are weak and the sound has no body.  There is little difference between 50% and 100% volume levels.  Even the included batteries for the remote are cheap carbon batteries instead of the normal alkalines.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Forget about \"channel surfing\"", "Author": "Michael Beato", "ReviewID": "R1MSICFFJJHMAW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The ViewSonic N1930W is a lousy TV.

It seems to only work best with HD channels, but my mother's 1999 tube works even better with HD channels so I don't know what the big deal with HDTVs. The picture quality was disappointing to say the least, and you have to jingle the sound options around a bit before you find what you like. This television is beautiful when it's off. It looks so high tech. I love it though, it gets the job done and it slim enough to fit on my little desk. My roomate has an LG though and her picture quality is off the chain, but mine looks better when its off so HA!", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "19-inch LCD HDTV offers high-definition viewing (720p), doubles as PC monitor\nClearPicture electronics eliminate noise, increase contrast and detail and optimize color for rich, vibrant images\nHigh brightness of 300 nits, high dynamic contrast ratio of 4000:1, and 1440 x 900 resolution\nInputs: 1 HDMI, 1 component, 1 composite, 1 S-Video, 1 PC\nIncludes removable stand; measures 17.4 x 14.8 x 6.1 inches with stand", "Name": "ViewSonic N1930w 19-Inch 720p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iK9qhjORL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0015DKAQK"}}
