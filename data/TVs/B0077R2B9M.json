{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrible Customer Service, TV Stopped Working While In Warranty and They Will Not Replace It", "Author": "amazon girl", "ReviewID": "R2EH4GKUDLQ5DW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV in May 2012. Around October/November 2012, it started going crazy. First, the screen would freeze and turn various solid colors or display lines and then shut down. Samsung took over 2 weeks to repair this problem. Basically, their repair company out in NJ couldn't be bothered to show up to 3 appointments so eventually Samsung agreed to send me a local technician. He fixed the problem but then new problems began where the TV couldn't stay on for more than 3 seconds without continuously restarting. Another repair ticket was issued and the TV has to be serviced again. I haven't been able to use the TV for over a week and am waiting on Samsung to send the technician the right part. Samsung is refusing to replace the TV and I can only imagine what other problems this TV is going to have. Based on my experience dealing with Samsung, I would say just don't take the risk and order from another manufacturer. The TV is beautiful but the hassle I have had to go through to get Samsung to keep their end of the bargain in their warranty is just not worth it. I may as well have thrown this money down the toilet because the amount of days I have had to take off from work and my family's inability to enjoy the TV over the holidays can not be rectified at this point.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible!", "Author": "S. Switzer", "ReviewID": "RXH154P4MYP18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had an old LCD Sony XBR, and this picture blows it away... the clarity is stunning. I compared this TV with the Samsung 8000, 7100, and the 6500. It's all about contrast ratio... the 8000 is 30 million to one. The 7500 is 25 mil. to one, the 7100 is 20 mil. to one, and the 6500 is 5 mil. to one. Comparing side by side, the 7500 and 8000 are close, but a few hundred dollars apart.... the 7500 and 7100 are close, but only $200 dollars apart, go for the 7500. The 6500 is quite a bit cheaper, but does not compare in picture quality to the 7500, hands down. The 7500 contrast is absolutely stunning, the colors much more vibrant. I compared these two for weeks at different stores, the pictures aren't even close. Go for the 7500. The black levels are insane, I can't say enough about this picture.Another comparison to the 6500; the 7500 in Standard picture mode, looks the same as the 6500 in Vivid mode. And because you shouldn't run a television continually in Vivid, is another great reason to buy the 7500.Something else to consider, a sales guy told me, even though I really didn't care too much about 3D, televisions with 3D have a much better processor and will look better in 2D as well.Keep in mind... this TV has a really clear front panel, almost like glass. This clear panel (v/s a matte panel) will not bend the light that is emitted, so the clarity is insane. The downfall is, a lot of glare. Samsung puts a special tint on the screen to try and tone down the glare, but it's still there. I happen to have a fairly bright north facing window opposite my TV, and while it is annoying during the day, it is just spectacular at night... well worth the inconenience during daytime viewing, but something to consider.As for the smart features... they work OK, but you'll need a really fast connection to the internet, standard DSL by Wi-Fi is unacceptable. If you're buying this TV for the Smart features, you may be disappointed... if you buy it for it's picture, you'll be blown away night after night.As for the sound, the speakers are really small, but if you adjust the equalizer just right, it's actually acceptable. While it's not great, I was pleasantly surprised. The only time we use the TV speakers is for the news or a quick program, otherwise it's pumped thru the receiver amp.Another suggestion.... no matter where you buy your TV, you can purchase the Square Trade 3 year warranty at Costco. A really cool benefit, that even the folks at Costco didn't know about... read the warranty at the desk, it states right on it. So for $99, you get a 3 year warranty AFTER the one year Samsung warranty, for a total of 4 years!This TV is just a blast to operate, and really is smart... If you pop a DVD in the Blu-ray player, the TV comes on automatically, changes the video input to DVD, and begins to play all by itself... Just write the check... you're going to love it!!!", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Window Into Another World", "Author": "J. fox", "ReviewID": "RSEV4HNCR6HVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is superb.  Its so colorful, clear and thin that the image looks like its floating.  Its like looking through a window.  I did have to take some time and read some forums on which settings to use, but once I calibrated this TV correctly I was blown away.  If you are not into that sort of thing, here is an easy place to start:  put the TV into movie mode, turn the backlight down to 8-10, contrast down to 85-90, and motion plus to 'clear'.  Play around from there and you'll find your sweet spot.I also found the internet features/apps to be faster than any other TV I have tried.  Searching and watching HD clips on YouTube is fast, easy, and glitch free.  You may want to invest in a wireless keyboard, but for me the remote worked fine.3D mode is excellent as well.  It comes with four pairs of 3D glasses.  Images a clear, with minimum ghosting and the pop out effect on certain scenes is truly a sight to be hold.  Everyone I've shown this TV too has loved it and said its the nicest looking set they've seen.  I agree.The motion and touch controls work well, if you are not an idiot (no offense).  I've seen some videos where people can't seem to get it to work, and I have to say its all on the individual not the TV.  If you speak clearly (don't yell or mumble) the TV responds.  The camera works well too.  I don't use these features much but its nice to know they are there and work.The only negative is the speakers.  I use a surround system anyway, but there was a time where my speakers were not hooked up (after I moved) and the speakers are too quiet at 10W.  My feeling is if you are in the market for this type of TV you most likely have a good audio system anyway.One final note.  My PS3 games look and play great with no noticeable lag.  As expected blurays look phenomenal. My advice if you are in the market for a new TV and are considering this one, get it.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too many flaws for the price", "Author": "Koplaw", "ReviewID": "R1LY2NZCEWWO04", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a beautiful TV.  However, there are just too many flaws.  To begin with, the internet apps would not work.  The menu confirmed I was connected to the internet, but nothing would work.  Many hours on the phone with Samsung led to nothing but frustration.  After going through every menu, I tried doing a manual software update.  It worked, but who knows for how long.  The picture is stunning, the 3D is great.  However, the sound is terrible.  I mean really bad.  Like you are listening in a tin can.  Also, the tv delevloped motion blur.  I think another reviewer said it was like a little jump every so often.  The picture is just so wonderful, I was going to let it go.  But for the price, you really should not have to learn to deal with the flaws.  Unfortunatately, this one is going back.  I have always been a loyal Samsung customer. This will be my last Samsung.  The customer service told me to unplug the TV, wait a minute, and plug it back in.  When that didn't work, they told me that was all they had, no one else could help. I should wait for the update which will fix it - it is coming out in several months! Seriously?  Samsung, you really need to get your act together on this one.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just gorgeous and well-conected too", "Author": "D. P. Maher", "ReviewID": "R1Z01JGEENPK35", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Basics:Video is outstanding. Standard 2D is as good as I have seen. I did not expect to even try the 3D, but I noticed in the MediaHub app you can stream some IMAX 3D content. That was just amazing. I am a convert. The 2D to 3D conversions are not bad, but necessarily much more limited than the native 3D. Watching the IMAX 3D underwater content was like looking into a huge aquarium. Truly awesome. Over time more of that kind of content will be available and I think the 3D is worth it for documentaries, nature, and like content. The glasses were not as much of a hassle as I thought, and you get 4 pairs.Sound is as good as any native TV sound system I have heard. Worthwhile playing with the audio settings, as there are some optimizations for dialog clarity, virtual surround, and an equalizer. We use this TV in two modes: A quiet mode where we just use the native audio, and \"big room\" mode where we use our external setup. Its nice to have decent native audio that is tunable. A toslink cable quickly connected the TV to our existing audio setup.Controls and setup:Setup was painless. No issues. I kept the voice and motion controls off to begin with, as I expected those to take awhile to set up. I was able to connect android tablet and iphone remote apps very easily. The best of these is an iphone app called myTifi remote. It was useful for typing in all of the account names and passwords for Skype, Amazon, Netflix, and Samsung accounts. The set comes with two Samsung remotes. The main one is really not that bad at all. Then there is a second \"smart remote\" that has a built-in trackpad. Its nowhere near as good as a trackpad or touchscreen on a phone, but not bad for mousing around on the smart TV screen. I also connected a Logitech wireless touch K400 keyboard placing the dongle in one of the TV's USB ports. It was recognized immediately by the Samsung TV setup menu. Even when I am watching TV, I can wakeup the Samsung menu system from the Logitech touchpad on the keyboard, getting a cursor, and then I can click and get a smart TV menu or a setup menu. We are not yet in the era of seamless integration of computers and TVs, however, as the keyboard does not work with the 3rd party apps. It does work with the built-in browser, but in a klunky kind of way: you can type in text to the browser, but the browser still brings up an onscreen keyboard obscuring part of the screen. Oh well.Internet:Samsung probably has as many TV apps as anyone except Sony. One app I miss from the Sony Blueray device (in another room) is the Berlin Philharmonic streaming app. Watching concerts with this app is wonderful since the camerawork is just first rate, and the sound is superb. But, Skype works well, and the Skype video in particular works really well. Lots of content-oriented apps like Amazon, Youtube, Amazon, etc. plus some 3D samplers. The browser is OK and useful with a keyboard. There is lots of room for improvement, but like in the case of gesture controls, this will take time for the whole Industry. Samsung has done a good job here. I can't grade them down until someone else (maybe apple) comes out with something better.\"Advanced features\"The voice and gesture controls of this set are a work in progress, for sure. I have evaluated a number of these technologies in my professional life over the year. I applaud Samsung for diving into this, but it is just not ready for prime time, as many have commented. I refuse to grad the product down for that, at this point. I have not heard of any TV manufacturer doing a better job at this. You could say why introduce the features before they are perfected? But I think it is useful to get these features out there and get experience with them from many users. If you don't want to be bothered with such \"bleeding-edge\" technology implementations, just leave them turned off. In this case I don't blame you and I join you. That said, I think for many the voice control will be useful. I suspect it will work OK for many people.The set is DLNA compatible, and includes an \"all-share\" proprietary networking capability. If you use a lot of Samsung devices (like their phones and tablets) it will work nicely, so you can stream content to it from those phones quite easily.The TV found my nexus tablet and all of the content on it, and played it without issue. I mostly use apple stuff, but I tried an iphone app called imedia share that works well, and there is an android and called \"Play to Samsung TV\" which I used to expose my android media files to the TV . None of this is as smooth as apple airplay, so of you value this capability just get an apple TV puck. But there will soon be competition for airplay.Summary:While this is not the top-of-the-line Samsung TV, this one has an amazing amount of technology and is over the air upgradeable. It will get better (and there is even a hardware slot on the back for hardware upgrades, though I doubt I will be using that). The basics are terrific, and connectivity is as good as anything I have seen. It is fun to play around with the voice and gesture controls, but don't expect much at this point. It will get better.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "UN46ES7500 - All my HDMI ports DO NOT work!", "Author": "Smokey the Cat", "ReviewID": "R8P71FLYQ3KX3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UN46ES7500 - All my HDMI ports DO NOT work!Very frustrated, only had this tv for 2 weeks..None of the HDMI ports no longer work...The HDMI cables are ok...my sources like my cable box, bluray player and ps3 all work on other HDTVs i own as well..I did a factory reset like the manual states, still nothing...also I have the latest firmware...Now I have to return it for a replacement...very very frustrating and upsetting..Ill keep UPDATING this, what a nightmare...so much for being a SMART tv...its a pretty \"DUMB\" one if all HDMI ports dont even work...HAS ANYONE HERE EXPERIENCED THIS HDMI PORT PROBLEM?

Beautiful picture quality! BUT...", "Author": "Weld Tech", "ReviewID": "R3O8W4JAAJY231", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE Review June 3rd 2012:After updating to the latest firmware, I've noticed the jitter, stuttering in playback is much less than before. Still leaving at 3 stars..since I should not see any of it.Factory reset didn't help either, every so often, a sputter is seen.Tried the gesture / motion control. LAME. Seem to not work too well, especially in dim to dark rooms. Even with good lighting, after setup the hand motion control is gimmicky at best. Could not get it to start again, by just waving my hand (like the manual states). Took too much effort / time, easier to use remote.Voice control is kinda neat, but still needs work. I found that using the universal remote with it's mike is better. Cannot turn on the TV with it though (though voice command).The universal remote seems to only control set top boxes (cable, satellite), DVD / Bluray players. Cannot control my external sound bar or WD media player. When programming it, you don't input codes (like in the past), you choose by make, model then data is sent to the universal remote and the IR blaster. The IR Blaster needs to remain on (uses 4 AA batteries - supplied), to be able to control the other devices.UPDATE May 26th 2012:Downgrading to 3 stars do to this anomaly:After nearly 1 week with this TV, (and it started 1 day of using it) I've noticed jitter (like a pausing) in the playback of video (through Uverse HD cable, or through a Media Player - WD media player live plus, even the bluray player). Odd thing, when I first got it, I set up the TV (turning on the anti blur stuff) and other settings for color, contrast, brightness, etc. Looked great. For around 8 hours, not a jitter, sputter in picture. The next day is when the jitter anomalies started. I read another user had this, he turned down the anti jitter setting (didn't say to what level, looks like the anti blur and jitter each have a range from 1 to 10 - the default is already factory set at 5 each). My settings were at 7 each, on my first day with this TV and without issues.So, when seeing these video jitters the next day, reading about it, I turned mine down to the original settings of 5 (anti blur and jitter). I still saw the issues. I turned off the motion LED, then turned off the MPEG smoothing (more anti blur technology), still issues. I actually did a reset of the anti blur / jitter settings (TV has a reset in that area), did not help. Disconnected TV from power strip conditioner for about 20 minutes, viewed TV again, still same issues.Dunno..maybe I have a lemon TV? It's noticeable, this anomaly. Around every 5 to 10 minutes, this jitter occurs for about 1 second (it's quick when it happens but definitely noticeable). Frustrating, concerning..that my 2000.00 dollar TV may be a troubled and or badly engineered product.IF YOU GET THIS TV, ensure that you do so from a company that will allow a return without any restock fees and enough time (30 days?) to evaluate it.One thing I did notice on unpacking this TV. The white Styrofoam type of covering on the TV was loosely placed on it, no tape. No clear plastic you'd normally see on the TV's screen was present. The base coupler device (the plastic that screws into the swivel base and then into the TV) that coupler's plastic bag was already opened. This TV may have been a demo or a return even though the TV's box was sealed (hmmm..paulstv reselling as new? - stay away from them as they also have a 15 % restock fee).Anyone have comments on how their TV was packed? Or any jitter / sputtering of their picture? Any settings ideas? Please post comments. Thanks!---------------------------Edited original review:Has USB input(I think 2 of them) for mem stick. I think it can read files from a hard drive (not too sure). Not tried this yet, not sure I want to in case of corruption to my HDD's files.Has digital audio output. I think an analog output too. Can run TV speakers with the digital audio output at the same time.GREAT picture, blacks are dark, whites are white. NO light BLEEDING on the sides, anywhere. LOTS of tweak settings for the picture.240 HZ refresh rate (has a very high CMR - clear motion rate at 840 - helps with fast video, less blur, so they say..). From what I've seen, I do see some blur on fast video, but nothing short of near perfection.Has 24p cinema playback, supposedly to \"smooth\" movies to what you may see in a movie theater. Its auto selected, if player's output is 24p, then TV plays in that mode.Built in wifi, works well, seen my Uverse router without issue (WEP key security, no issues connecting).5 band EQ for sound setting for the TV's speakers (which sound OK, but not great..acceptable).Thin TV, but is that really a plus? This TV is kind of heavy, around 40 LBS I think. The thinness makes the speakers lack good/great sound, only offering good sound.Thin bezel (frame) so it can fit in smaller spaces than other models.Has some type of way to play videos/music/pictures from a PC that's on the same network (DNLA most likely). The mpg video I tried to play...\"the file you've selected is not currently supported\". *sigh*4 pairs of 3D glasses (20.00 specials seen here on amazon). They work well. Using the typical nickle size, flat batteries (supplied).Will play 2D movies in 3D (from any source: cable, bluray, dvd, media players). Can convert 3D to 2D if desired.Can set 3D depth and 3D quality settings, to avoid \"blurred\" 3D (but will suffer in the 3D depth when doing so). If you can set it to high, the 3D looks amazing.Has a swivel base, can tilt TV to the left or right about 10 degrees or so.CONS:NO VGA, or DVI input seen on this TV (I've seen some sites claiming this TV has a VGA input). Should have 4 HDMI inputs (especially for this price!!).Has web browser but not like a PC...limited on what it can do.NO Crackle?? C'mon! So, I used the web browser to go to crackle.com. Yay, I'm there. Selected movie and ...\"Express install is not supported by this operating system\".  *SIGH*  Well that sux, can't play crackle movies. If this TV runs in Linux, then it may be a long time / never, when Adobe updates flash player for Linux (see Boxee box issues).Speakers don't sound as good as my previous, thicker TV (samsung un40eh5000) that I had, but that's what my sound bar is for. But, they are most acceptable.Doesn't seem to offer near as much smart apps as Panasonic models.Conclusion:Overall, great picture quality and with great 3D, with some added features that do not reliably seem to work.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Voice and motion control useless", "Author": "H. Reed \"Asheville Man\"", "ReviewID": "R2L47A0KYLFEAC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Update: 5/29/12Upon some \"Good\" advice we kept this TV past the 30 day return window in order to do an update of the software that was supposed to \"Fix\" the voice recognition feature.  We have now done two update revisions from Samsung and there is very little improvement.  So little that we are not sure if it is really improved or we are just feeling so bad for ending up stuck with this TV that we are trying to imagine some improvement.  No matter how clearly you enunciate your words, softly or loudly you speak you can't get the TV to even turn on more than 25% of the time and there is just no predictability in how it responds.  And it more often turns on for no reason with no one in a very quiet room than it will with you speaking to it.  At this point we are just trying to make the most of it and hoping that Samsung gets their act together and gets this working in a future software update.Previous review:We are so dissapppointed with this TV.  While the picture is great and the sound is really good given the ultra thin cabinet we really bought this TV for the promise of not needing to always have a remote in hand.  The motion control only works at the brightest times of the day and the voice command feature is useless from any distance greater than about 5 feet.  The microphone on the remote apparently doesn't work or is just as deaf as the mic on the TV.  So unless you sit within 5 feet of a 46 inch TV voice command is not for you.The remote is not sensitive enough and unpredictable in how the touch control interprets your movements.  Entering text in the web application is agonizingly slow and tedious.  I am seriously considering returning this TV and getting the same picture quality version from last year which will save me several hundred dollars and give me a better remote.What a dissappointment!

You may wonder why it has taken me so long to write a review? I wanted to wait and not make any haste decisions.- Upon receiving the TV it was very easy to setup and and the basic instructions was all I required.- The TV picture for both 2D and 3D is FABULOUS at 1920 x 1080 for the high definition broadcast from Comcast. The Wi-Fi and camera work excellent. The speakers are not to shabby either. I would recommend this TV to people interested in a high end, high quality TV.So why the 4 stars and not five. There is certainly some things Samsung can do better.1) The web page by Samsung for support is not intuitive at all and once you finally find a document the explanation for the most part is terrible. I spent many hours at this site looking for some answers.2) The hand movement function on the TV is useless. Tried lots of different locations and lighting and for the most part it occasionally worked.3) Voice recognition is nice, but it would be nice to be able to train it to respond to your commands. Tried changing channels with voice command and hardly ever gets the numbers correct. Tried changing the source with voice commands and that works about 50% of the time. This is a nice feature to play with, but I believe Samsung can make it 100% better.4) When using smart hub or samsung aps the current controls supplied are very time consuming to use. Going to the web with out a keyboard and mouse will be very painful.I believe Samsung will continue to improve the above mentioned problems. I love the idea that I can download software updates to enhance and improve features. What Samsung needs to do when updating the TV is to supply a list of what was fixed and what enhancements were added. I believe this could be done with a white paper opened on the screen after they download and install the upgrade.

Here is why it got 4 stars and why it didn't get 5.Setup:DirectTV STBPS3 hookedYamaha YAS-101 soundbarMy Yamaha only has optical inputs so I plugged the audio directly from the STB and PS3 to the soundbar.  The Samsung TV does not pass through Dolby Digital.  I digress... this is about the TV.Picture:Fantastic picture.  It does need to be calibrated to your liking so you can pull that up on the internet.  I like to watch my Bluray/DVD movies in the movie setting and turning off all the effects.  On regular TV channels, I like the automotion to be there and the screen to be a little more bright.  Make sure you calibrate it as blu ray movies can look awful if left untouched.Sound:What do you expect from a thin TV?  Sure you can hear stuff but it's like getting hubcaps with your ferrari.  Put in the extra monies for a sound system.. at minimum a soundbar.Design:Whooa.. it's pretty.  I have a cabinet and this is the biggest TV I could fit in it.  Thank goodness Samsung makes super slim frames.  It's like looking through a window.Features and function:This is where it falls short.  While using it like a regular TV.. it's great.  Turns on quickly and works just the way you want it to.  The funky part is with the \"smart\" features.  Voice and motion control is a joke.  It's not ready for prime time.  The TV would sometimes turn off out of nowhere.  Voice commands work but they don't work when you want them to, unless you're standing in the right position.  They also include two remotes.. why?  It's really no use.  They try to tell you that you can use their remote for your devices.  If you're like me and I bet a lot of people, you use a set top box from cable or SAT... and you own a DVR.  How can you access your Guide or DVR list.  You can't.. deeming this remote to be useless.  After I programmed it to my DirectTV remote I was all set.Conclusion:This is hands down a great TV.  It does seem like Samsung was trying to push its new features out too early to get ahead of the competition.  I'm not sure if anyone is buying the TV for these functions.. if you are.. you'll feel that there is a lot left to be desired.Tip: For you extended warranty purchasers, it's better to buy it from Costco.

But my friends had recommended Samsung more for its picture quality, name and user experience. In retrospect, I'd still have gone either way.ACTIVE 3DThis was an area I was not really able to compare further since I could only purchase one TV. I did test against the active vs. passive only with previous purchases from my friends (they mostly had the active), and with testing passive at Best Buy. My eyes reacted better with active but would notice a better 'pop-up' figure in the passive 3D provided by LG. In the end, I went with active and Samsung. You could also check this CNET review for reference: [...]BLACK or METALLIC?You could select between this black version from the silver one (UNES7500 vs. UNES8000). The downside with the metallic S8000 is that the metal edge does not seem to be closed very well. There's a noticeable gap in display models I've seen in Best Buy and other known appliance shops. Apart from the better enclosed edges (seamless), the black version also gives you a better way of not noticing the edges since they're black.SCREENI've previously had a Sony XBR3 (circa 2008), and I would say that the size of the Sony XBR and the other older TV versions makes the screen bigger. In this Samsung model which is wider screened and with thinner edges. If I had the chance to buy again, I'd go for at least the 55-inch than this 46-inch model I purchased. But overall, I'm still satisfied, and won't mind purchasing Samsung in the future.SOME DOWNSIDEI did not like how packaging and the delivery was handled via UPS/Amazon. The box was not in good shape, and I only realized that there was a chip in the corner of the TV shortly after delivery. The mere thought of returning such a huge item was a hassle for me. This was why I did not even consider returning it after an inquiry with Amazon customer support. What more is that there has been a free blu-ray player promotion shortly after the purchase. Amazon recommended that I return the purchase to avail of the promo. As a compromise, they gave me a $50 gift card to complement the then USD 79.99 price tag for the Samsung 3d blu ray player.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exelente", "Author": "Roberto Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R3P5W8Z8SK2KQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente televisor  conecta muy bien y eso que tengo aba de CANTV y el Internet es r\u00e1pido!!! muy buena compra!!", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "came with not working sound....", "Author": "Arunas Ivanauskas", "ReviewID": "RDBUAQIKH1JOD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got view but no sound... :( So be cautious if you buy this TV....
