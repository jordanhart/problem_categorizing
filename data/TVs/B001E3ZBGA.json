I got the TV at Sams Club for $1190.00. It is NOT the same one as the 47\" at Wal-Mart so don't go to Wally world for it!I hooked up the cable, Blu-Ray and a Wii with component cables in under 30 minutes and it looks phenominal!Two thmbs up and I will revise this update if anything changes.

We considered the 42\" and decided to just go ahead and get what we really wanted- the big one!The picture and sound was pretty good when we installed it while awaiting Dish Network's coming out to switch us over to HDTV, but once we switched, it was truly breathtaking.  Beautiful clarity, rich colors and very good sound.I say go for the biggest you can handle, get the HDMI cable for your hookup (NOT INCLUDED) and sit back and enjoy theatre quality broadcasts.  Be sure to get this model and not the older one which isn't 120hz.  I saw a difference.  And as for what irritated other reviewers- the remote- I see it as streamlined- not chintzy.  Besides, who uses that remote on a regular basis?Just can't say enough about the quality of Philips TV's.  We now have three in the house.  But this one is definitely the best!", "Date": "December 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great product if it wasn't possessed", "Author": "Astroboy \"Hipsterism\"", "ReviewID": "R36SYU069BEBNT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked this TV up for the price of my 32\" Samsung and I got to say that it's not a bad purchase at $547. It had above average color rendering with no color bleed or wash. This is an awesome TV.  I am very impressed with the four speakers that are installed in the chassis to give it a nice sound. The 2ms refresh helps with gaming consoles. The matted screen is perfect for a room that has a lot of sunlight.  I would give this TV a five star rating but....The one single complaint I have about this TV is that it randomly turns itself on and off. Just out of the blue it will turn off then turn back on. No rhythm or reason to it; sometimes the TV has been just turned on or times it has been on for hours. Never the less it happens and Philips has twice replaced the power board and the problem still continues. Philips went so far as to send the newer 2009 model the 7704 and while it didn't turn on and off they have watered the product down quite a bit. It's all plastic and is about 15 pounds lighter than the 7403. The protective screen is reflective and flimsily in comparison to the 7403. So back into the box went the 7704 and back up on the living room wall went the 7403 and now I am going to work Philips over to get me another 7403 that isn't possessed.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "AMAZZAZZING TV!!!  JUST BUY IT!", "Author": "Surf Kid", "ReviewID": "R1T795GCDLEV8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV as a floor model from Costco for [...] (with a 2 year warrany included!) and on Black Friday I bought the Sony Blue-Ray BDP-BX1 [...]. Yah, I made out! Look around, besides Amazon's current pricing, I would have paid double. The picture is incredible. The sound if fine, but good for the speakers being in the back for asthetics. Besides, you want a Yahama sound system to go with something like this anyhow. The framing is gorgeous with a glass look to it. The base swivels. The TV sits higher on the base than most. The Auto picture feature bounces back and forth a lot, but you get use to that. They could improve with a newer firmware update than 1.15 to lock in the auto feature. All-in-all, you would waste you money on anything else, unless the deal is better. I have owned it for 90 days now and was debating on returning it at Cosco before the 90 days are up if I had problems or there was something better out there or the reviews from others were bad due to problems they were experiencing. I have been all over the web and I think we are unanymous in saying it is an amazing TV!!! I struck gold on this deal and am keeping for years to come. I am just as amazed watching today as the day I first turned it on. It's actually fun to watch TV again.

Donaldson", "ReviewID": "R3UKMAGQNMHGIC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV is a good deal for the budget minded consumer.  It has a slightly above average picture compared to other HDTVs in the price range once you get the settings correct but the factory sound is sub-par (not that I use the factory speakers).The amount of inputs is very nice, especially the 4 HDMI ports, although I only use 1 because I run my other components through my Onkyo receiver.When I first received the TV I went through the set up wizard and selected what I thought was best to include the HD Natural Motion option.  When I first started watching shows there was an aweful yellow tint to the flesh tones and the TV kept automatically chaning ratio and flickering between bright and dark.  I contacted support and they said it was because of the HDMI cables (I did skimp on the cables) so I went and bought the $120 Monster cables rated for 120hz, that was $360 wasted because it kept doing it, although the tint problem did correct a little bit.  I went back through and redid the settings wizard this time I took off the natural motion, and went for the less vibrant settings.The picture is a lot better now, it doesn't change ratio, the tint is only there a little when I watch blu-rays and it only flashes between dark and light on the darkest scenes.", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Execellent TV", "Author": "Betty Gomez \"Bettylove\"", "ReviewID": "RN27D1QFY7TB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a refurblished 37\"  directly purchased from phillps 2006 and so I was feeling confident about this purchase and I was not disappointed,moved the 37\" to the living room which now looks better than ever and placed this 47\" in the bed room and I was spprized at the quality of the build and clearity of the picture, i would diffinantly recommend this TV", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work with a laptop", "Author": "Wakabayashi", "ReviewID": "R2XZ889OXY3N5N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture is fine but I when I tried to connect it to my laptop ...,I found out that it doesn't take the VGA output which most LCD TVs do.It 's a bloomer, not that many laptops got that DVI output that you can hook it to the HDMI input of the TV.
