{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV - Excellent PC monitor", "Author": "digAl", "ReviewID": "RIU6SACRMHBOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV after reading through lots and lots of reviews. I wanted a larger PC monitor that could also double as an HDTV without being too costly. I got it from another website for under 400 with a 45-day return policy. I almost got the 32\" model, but going all-out for the bigger one was better!I found that not all large HDTVs could clearly display the small text that computers use at 1920x1080 resolution. I have a beautiful 58\" Panasonic plasma that accepts PC-input, but reading text on it is horrible! I'm no expert, but I read it has to do with better TVs (like this JVC) having 4:4:4 chroma subsampling.This JVC is excellent for all general PC work. Windows7 recognized it, and I didn't need to configure a thing. And computer games like Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim are even more incredible at 37 inches. The \"ambient light sensor\" has an off-low-med-high setting to compensate for any room lighting. Black levels are very nice. Also great is its \"auto-shutoff\" feature after about 40sec of not receiving an input signal (like when my PC turns off the signal to the monitor after 15min). After this, it also wakes up appropriately by keyboard or mouse wiggle.(it does take a bit longer than a usual PC monitor. about 9sec to power up)I also use the \"sleep timer\" and the \"audio-only\" features to listen to TV as I go to sleep.The speakers sound incredible for little built-in TV speakers. Most panel TV speakers sound bad and the reviews I read on how good this JVC sounds were correct. The \"SRS studio sound HD\" isn't as good as a full AVR 7.1 system of course, but good for it's intended purpose.The size does dominate my desk, but I sit about 3 foot from it and don't have eyestrain or crane my neck to see corner to corner. Looking at it from off angle is excellent too.(unlike my old PC monitor)Compared to a plasma, this TV is amazingly light for its size. It also includes VESA mounting holes if you plan on wall mounting it. And much lower wattage than a plasma too.It's got analog and digital audio output, but I didn't use it. It also has a USB slot for watching JPEGs, I don't use it either.Cons: 1) the included base doesn't pivot up/down or turn at all. No big deal really.2) I wish it had an LED backlight, but it'll be a few more years before those come down into this price range.:(3) The Panoramic Stretch video mode could use more work. I sometimes watch old 4:3 content and I like the mode that stretches the edges of the screen more than the center. On JVCs that is the \"Panoramic Stretch\". Panasonics do a better job with a large center with normal aspect and then stretching the edges to fill the widescreen. I'm just picky on this mode, some people don't mind watching short-fat people, or they can use the \"Zoom\" mode [crop the top and bottom] or \"square screen\" mode [bars on the left and right].Overall I more than pleased with this purchase. I hadn't heard of JVC TVs since the 90's. Good to see they're still around and standing up to the likes of Sony, LG, Samsung etc.EDIT(07MAR2012): I'm still loving this HDTV as my primary computer monitor!! 37-inch seems the perfect size.I found a test for 4:4:4 chroma subsampling and this TV passes under VGA, but fails using HDMI. HDMI still looks good, but not as crystal-clear as VGA. This is strictly talking about reading regular-size computer text at 1080p and NOT Movie/TV show picture quality which always looks good regardless of VGA or HDMI. In fact I love watching HD videos using a Patriot Box Office 1080p High-Definition Media Player PCMPBO25 (Black) on the HDMI-1 port.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "quit working", "Author": "Rev", "ReviewID": "R1ZIC9JZI39ZHV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got it at Christmas as a present, it was purchesed from costco, great picture, good functions and all, then it just mysteriously stopped working yesterday, jvc logo comes up when i turn it on and then it freezes, i have to manually unplug it to turn it off.

Seven weeks later the TV won't turn on and it's going back to Costco.

If they had more in stock I would exchange it for another one, but all the stores are sold out of this model.

With 100% backlight and ambient light sensor set to OFF, the picture is about right for a bright room. Mine has no dead pixels. I turned down contrast to 28 and turned up brightness to 67 at a crude calibration while connected to a PC. The picture quality is excellent as a large monitor which is my main use. Very easy to read text.My other use is the ATSC tuner watching OTA. I just use the stock 'MOVIE' picture setting for this. Scanning the channels was quick and painless, no analog channel was picked up, yeah! Tuner sensitivity seems on par with a Samsung. There is only program name, parental rating and basic stuff. No program detail and of course no extended program guide. No time display. The other nit pick is the need to dial in 2-1 instead of just 2 to get the digital channel.The remote is excellent with direct buttons for HDMIs and other inputs. However, there is no Closed Caption button.The other feature worth mentioning : there is no overscan for 720p sources...I love it!

I brought my 19\" Vizio to test out the Fios HD box and HDMI connection and everything worked fine on that.  I also tried out the HDMI cable on another LCD TV and different box and there was no popping noise on that TV either.  The component wires work fine (no popping noise). I called JVC Support and they thought it was the HDMI wire so I bought a 1.3 HDMI cable, which is recommended for this TV (I was using a 1.4 HDMI cable previously) and tried that but the popping noise still was there.  I exchanged the TV at Costco and hooked up the new one and the popping noise was still there.

I initially started looking at higher-priced LED TVs but happened across this TV at Costco this week for $350 and scooped it up.  For the price, it can't be beat - a 37\" LCD 1080p set.  Yes, it's missing some features like internet connectivity but I have that on my main TV in the den so that was not a deal breaker.  It's got a very good picture and very good sound.  I'm quite happy with this set.Update 5/22/2013So after 17 months, I encountered the freeze problem that others have mentioned.  Since I bought it at Costco, they give you a 2nd year on the warranty (and I bought another 3 years worth of warranty for $30).  Costco diagnosed the problem on the phone, ordered parts and sent a repairman out within a week.  Amazingly, he plugged it in, powered it on and it worked fine!  Isn't it always like that :-)On the phone, they had me unplug the TV, plug it back in, hold down the power button on the set for 60 seconds, plug it into a wall outlet instead of a power strip, etc.  Nothing worked.  Now, having left it unpowered for a week, it's working fine again.  Well, at least I have 3 1/2 more years on the warranty.  If I'd only had a 1 year warranty I probably would have chucked it last week instead of leaving it unpowered for a week and trying again.further update:1/2 hour later and the set is freezing up again - need to get them to come back!even further update:the repairman came back - replaced the board and set is working againclearly this set has reliability issues but there's now a new model out that supposedly is betterupdate 7/29/13:2 months after having the TV repaired, it failed again the same way.  Costco is very responsive and is sending someone out this week with another new board but this is getting annoying.  I have a 5 year warranty - wonder how many more repairs I'll need in that time!
