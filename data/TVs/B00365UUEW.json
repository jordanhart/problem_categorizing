Right from the start, the sound was \"tinny\", no matter how many adjustments I made to the Setup.  So, I bought a set of external speakers with a woofer, and the sound was better.  Then, after about six months, the \"audio-out\" (that the speakers were plugged into) stopped working.  I checked the speakers on a different piece of equipment, and the speakers were fine; so, the problem is the TV unit.  Of course, it's beyond the labor warranty (only 90 days), and only the parts warranty (one year) applies now; so, we'll see how much they will cover to fix this.  In any case, they charge $25 for return shipping on ANY warranty work.  That sucks!  I would NOT recommend this product.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "It is good for the price", "Author": "Yoiyumtewa", "ReviewID": "R1AY6EQPU9AGM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Once of the Cheapest LED out there. The picture is crisp and the sound quality is great. maybe the 22\" was built different than the 19\" . overall , for the price, i think it is very good purchase.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00365UUEW"}}
