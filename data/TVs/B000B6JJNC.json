This Olevia TV is a great deal. It is bright, has great connection features and the picture when hooked up to a hdtv source (be it DirecTV or DVD) looks fantastic. When you put it side by side to any Sony or Sharp for that size, it is very hard to justify paying an extra $1000 to get those. This TV is pretty awesome. The response time is perfect at 8 ms, so while watching football or hockey there are no motion artifacts. The only slight drawback is its remote is rather clunky, but not bad and not enough that it would lower my score. We use our satellite remote anyway and it is hooked up to a suround sound system even though the speakers that come with it sound great as well. Good job Syntax! I recommend this LCD TV. Perfect size as well.", "Date": "November 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Price & Performance that can't be beat", "Author": "Christopher J. Hans \"Kaiser Hanzi\"", "ReviewID": "R2V96QEX3SHCZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first LCD tv that I've owned but based on what I've seen of others in the big box stores, this one stands up against units that cost more than double what this does. I've had it running now for over a week and it works as advertised - and that's what i'm looking for in any product. I haven't found any feature or function that is not what they claim it to be. Yes some of the common brand names have a more slick case and nicer remote but none of them had anything compelling enough for me to spend upwards of $3000.00. Overall this Olevia tv is a quantum leap for me personally as I was using a 9 year old RCA 36 inch monster that had seen it's better days. The big guys better watch out - if Syntax keeps delivering better product at half the price of the competition, they could really grab some market share. Bottom line - if you want to get into a high def LCD tv thats of a reasonable size but can't drop 3 grand - give this one a try.", "Date": "October 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "TV delivered non-working, worst support I have EVER experienced, but a great TV", "Author": "Gabriel", "ReviewID": "R326MARU8IG07X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since my original review, I have revised my opinion of this set.  I now give it four stars out of five, but it's the support that gets only two stars out of five.I'm a pretty fair guy, and I always try to post something positive about things when I can.  I never appreciate when others have nothing good to say about something, and can only harp about how bad something is.Out of the box, the TV's screen flickered on and off, with a buzzing sound that was annoying.The specs sounded good, the reviews said \"good value, great TV\", but I didn't realize I would be spinning the roulette wheel on this.  But in spite of spending the extra cash for the extended warranty, it took forever to get a replacement.  It is advertised as \"in-home repair\", but what that means is you have to first find a way to actually reach their support teams, which is pretty much impossible, unless they FEEL like calling you back.They offer a telephone number to call, but when you do, you have to navigate through their seemingly easy voicemail system, only to be number whatever in line, and do you wish to hold ... if so press \"1\" ... no answer ... still wish to hold press \"1\" ... no answer ... sorry nobody is answering, so you'll have to go back to the main menu, lose your place in line (seriously ... I'm not kidding here), and start all over.  It's THE WORST SUPPORT LINE EVER!  I spent an hour trying to get through sometimes getting to be next in line, holding, holding, holding, only to get kicked out to the main menu DESPITE ASKING TO HOLD, where I had to start all over, only to find myself SEVENTH IN LINE.I can't say enough about how bad the support communication is.  They suggested sending email, which I sent REPEATEDLY, but without getting anything more than \"we have your information and we'll get back to you\".  It took over a week to get a response.  They took my credit card info, but after that I didn't hear anything from them, despite multiple voicemails left and emails sent.If you want something that you KNOW will work, but want top-notch support, I suggest you consider Sony.  They aren't cheap, but they KNOW how to support their customers.That said, I FINALLY got a response to a sharply worded email to Syntax, letting me know that the TV had already been shipped.  This email came though not from my Customer Support rep, who was in charge of my case, but rather from a different TECHNICAL support rep who I had previous contact with.  They were very responsive after that, and apparently Syntax recognizes it has a problem and is looking for solutions, as they met that day about my issue and have promised to make changes to improve their communications with the consumers.I'm sure I'm not the only person to complain to them, so hopefully things will improve.  I will give them another star for \"intent to improve\" as well as the efforts of one particular technical support rep (initials C.T.) who went out of his way to do what he could to make me happy.As for my replacement TV, it arrived within a couple of days via UPS and it works flawlessly after they responded to my sharp email with the shipping info.So, now for my review of the TV itself, which worked fine this time.I mounted it on the wall.  I STRONGLY recommend doing this, as I have seen a LOT of LCD televisions for sale on eBay with broken screens, which are more expensive to fix than they are to buy new.  This particular TV weights 75 lbs., so you will need a good strong mount.  I chose the Ulti-Mount, which allows the TV to tilt, swivel, and rotate, giving it you a lot of positioning options.As has been mentioned before, the remote doesn't have a very high quality feel, but I like the larger buttons, as I have larger fingers and the remotes with little tiny buttons can be difficult for me to use.The picture on the TV is great.  Excellent color, excellent contrast, good black level, nice sharp image.The menu system is relatively intuitive, although it took me a little while to get used to having to go back to the menu button to leave screens/menus that were opened with other buttons.  One of the neat features of the set is the Electronic Program Guide (EPG).  For the DTV (broadcast HD) channels, it can display the program listing for the currently selected channel, as well as descriptions of the program, as long as the broadcasting station supports those features.The menu button that allows you to select the source brings up a list of inputs to choose from.  It would be nice if the system would allow you to name these sources yourself, so that rather than choosing the \"YpBpr1\" source, I could choose a source named \"Satellite\" instead.  Also, the \"display\" button, which I always mistake for the source button, shows program information, and I think should be relabeled \"Info\".One of the aesthetically cool things about the set, is the brand name \"Olevia\" at the bottom, which lights up in blue.  Unfortunately, it lights up when the TV is OFF, instead of when it's ON, which can be annoying when the set is in a bedroom where you might prefer darkness without annoying lights in the dark.  It also is more intuitive to know when the set is turn on, to see a light on, and when the set is off, the light is off.My only other criticism is that it would be nice if all the menus and displays had the same \"look and feel\".  Instead, there are four different styles and sizes of menus and screens.  Making this consistent would be more aesthetically pleasing.Another \"nice to have\" would be to have the ability for the TV to either automatically switch to the broadcast resolution for the channel being watched, or be able for it to remember the last resolution selected for each channel.  I find switching from a 1080i broadcast to those with lesser resolutions to be annoying, and am constantly having to readjust the resolution to get the best possible display.So, to sum up this review, Syntax's 37\" TV gets four out of five stars, and their support gets two out of five stars (despite the number of stars shown at the top, which apparently I can't change).Good luck!", "Date": "March 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good TV", "Author": "Yi Feng", "ReviewID": "R3429XGHZX86B1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV for 2 weeks. Overall I like it.1. It is a HDTV. Amazon says HD-Ready which is not accurate. It has a build-in ASTC which works fine with a HD atenna I loaned from someone.2. I still subscribed from Comcast a HDTV box. Using its component outputs, 11 HD channels look awesome. The bad thing is once you get used to these 11 channels, those old analog ones become horrible to view. Comcast NTSC tunner seems worse than this TV's own NTSC tunner. When I hook the cabel directly to the TV's atenna-in, the pictures indeed look better than those from the camcast box. However, Camcast encrypted all HD channels to force you use their box.3. I then bought a Philips 5900/37 DVIX/DVD player with HDMI output. The player is capable to do 720p and 1080i up-conversion. Suprisingly, the upconversion looks great. I can see no blocks. I threw in two HD-DVIX movies. They play back on the TV with fantastic pictures. I love HDMI. Once cable for both crystal clear video and audio.4. The only drawback is its VGA input. I do think it is bit too fuzzy for a computer monitor. And it doesn't sync very well with 1280x1024@60. I tried a computer game \"Call of Duty\". It looks good but not great. They should've provided both DVI and HDMI.Overall, I think the TV serves the mission really well. I highly recommend it.I bought it directly from Target. $1415 including Tax. and shipping.

The picture quality of this TV is so great that I cannot see any difference between this TV and other brands such as Panasonic and Samsung. However, my TV has a buzz problem with the left speaker. When no sound presents in the TV, this buzz can be heard even 2 yards away. I called their technical support, they told me it is normal. I cannot agree with them on this point. Their technical support is too weak or not as helpful as expected. This issue looks like some leakage problem with certain electricity capacities.  Hopefully, it is an individual case. Other than this, this TV is great.", "Date": "December 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "Crystal Clear HD", "Author": "M. Phillips", "ReviewID": "R3403BA3KQXZ8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this up about 2 weeks ago for $1049.  This TV has exceeded my expectations.  I only have basic cable.  The picture is decent in SD and there are lots of tweaks for the picture and audio. The PIP and split screen are pretty cool too. The real surprise came when I purchased an HD antenna at Radio Shack for under $50.  I live about 35 miles south of Los Angeles.  After going to Antennaweb.org to dial in my antenna placement I was all set up.  I can pick up over 50 DIGITAL channels with the antenna, about 18 of those are in either 720P or 1080i. I can get more HD channels with the antenna than the cable company offers for $$$...and no cable box required. The clarity in HD is unbelievable. Sports and PBS nature shows are awesome to watch. It looks like you are looking through a window rather than a TV screen.  The HD picture is crisp and clear and the colors are bright and very vivid, the sound is very good also.  My only complaint is that there is only 1 HDMI interface.  Would need 2 if I wanted to have a HD cable or sat box and upconvert DVD player. The remote is pretty dorky looking also, but who cares.  Some reviewers have complained of a hissing sound coming from the speakers, I have not noticed it in mine. I also emailed Olevia support with a stupid question just to see if they would reply, the did within 24 hours. I would definately check out this LCD TV if you are considering buying and want to save some cash.

The color and brightness are superb. I feel as though I am watching HDTV for the first time again. The looks of the TV are great, as is the sound. Do yourself a favor and check this TV out. I took a look at it at COMPUSA and loved the way it looked. I got it here at AMAZON for $1100 with free shipping and no tax. It is by far the best deal. I also found no dead pixels on the screen.

As good as any I've seen anywhere.  Better than many of the higher priced brands.  I've used it with Computer, Xbox 360, DTV, etc... and it has more than enough hookups, inputs, etc.A few things:The remote is not very good.  However, I don't use it much.Native VGA res is 1024x768...  4:3 on a 16:9 screen, so computer images are stretched if using Standard XP.  Nero Home did the conversion for me so that DIVX movies have the proper aspect, and Media Center edition will do the same.Do yourself a favor and go through one of the \"Setup\" menus on a THX DVD.  I used \"The Incredibles\".  You can set your brightness and tint to THX spec, test and set up your audio, etc...

I purchased mine after Thanksgiving on Black Friday at Microcenter with a great (ca $1000) after rebate price.  Worked well until Jan 11 when it suddenly went stone cold dead.  After wading through the endless customer service phone trees and non-responsive e-mails, I finally was able to talk with someone who said based on the symptoms, a new TV rather than onsite service was in order.  But first I either had to give them my credit card number and they would put a $2000 hold on it or I had to ship the TV back to them and when they got it they would send a replacement.  I chose the latter.  UPS picked it up (reluctantly, at first they claimed it was too big) and two weeks later Syntax shipped another.  UPS lost it.  After dealing with both UPS and Syntax neither of which were very responsive, Syntax shipped another replacement which arrived dead on arrival last week--9 weeks after the first one failed.  Now I am still waiting endlessly to get to talk to someone at Syntax to send me another one.  If you ever get to talk to a live body at Syntax, don't let them go or you could be on hold for another hour when you have to call back. I have yet to have anyone respond to voice messages and only once or twice to e-mails after several days. It will be 10 weeks tomorrow that my first TV went dead and I still don't have one that works and it looks like it could be another month before I have one.., Horrible customer service.  and by the way, it's almost 4 months since I sent in the rebate form to Syntax and I still haven't received it, although their web site now says it has been approved and the check is \"pending.\"  Up until about 2 weeks ago the web site didn't even acknowledge that I had a rebate pending.

I contacted Syntax customer support by email and got a prompt answer. They appear to be willing to work something out with the rebate if you send in a photograph of your serial code and UPC symbol from the back of the TV (as well as the Amazon invoice - which I had to print out as I never received an actual physical invoice). I encourage all those in my situation to contact their customer service email.Okay, the TV. I was going for a Sharp Aquos 37\", but decided to save about $1500 and get the Syntax Olevia instead.CONS: It seems a bit bulkier and more computer flat-panel in design than living room chic (I love the glass frame look of the Samsungs). I would have liked detached speakers. When audio is muted or off, you can hear some residual noise. I would have liked pure silence.PROS: The display is bright, good contrast, and the built-in tuner is nice. I use it currently for DVDs, so I can't really test HD resolutions yet. I use an Oppo Digital DVD player with HDMI outputs. My wife loves the new TV and enjoys watching shows on it.Overall, I think there's good value for the money spent.

My sights were on Panasonic plasma panel TH-PHD8UK. In the stores I could check only the older model LT37HV - and it was OK but nothing special. However financial realities - almost $2K for a good 42\" Panasonic Plasma, plus the stand, plus time & efforts & getting-help (and expense!!) to install the plasma panel, plus the greater delicacy of the plasma compared to LCD - compelled me to abandon my expensive tastes and go for this LCD TV.This TV was at the low margin wrt. screen size and capabilities - I didn't consider anything smaller than 37\". Also, this is my first Hi-Def TV, but I've experience with normal LCD TVs (used 20\" for video editing) and LCD displays (21\" is my main computer display, 1600x1200).First impressions - this Olevia TV is great! Its functionality is pretty basic, but the quality (so far :-) is wonderful. Both HDTV and DVD displays were breathtaking. SD and digital channels were also quite fine (with some exceptions, which are not TV's faults in my educated opinion). Number of possible connections is quite sufficient for most applications. HDMI is included, and it offered me the best picture quality. Component (2 inputs) works great. I haven't even bothered with composite and S-Video (2 each). Built-in speakers are OK, but I mostly use it with my audio system.  My viewing distance was between 5 and 12 feet - I was happy with the screen size & picture. I tried over-the-air HDTV - and it worked fine.PROS:- Great price.- Great video quality.- Nice calm non-intruding finish.- HDMI and plenty of other connections.- Built-in speakers for those who need them.- Decent capabilities (picture size, DTV reception, etc. etc).- Not so \"touchy\" with transportation, installation, usage (LCD is  more resilient than, say plasma).CONS:- Doesn't have Zoom picture mode (only 4:3, 16:9, Panoramic and Full).- Speakers are not detachable (not a big deal, just takes unnecessary space).OVERALL: I am very happy with this 37\" LCD TV.

It refuses to work at almost all but direct angles.- Dropping LCD prices ensure the price you pay will be more than if you waitNote that I've bought expensive electronics and I can tell you, the expensive electronics fail just like the cheap ones.

I am still a very happy Olevia tv owner! TV works great, maybe I am just one of the luckier owner of this tv. Some reviews mentioned TV doesn't work because of LCD. COME ON! If you would have done some research, you would have know all the tv manafactur buys LCD from LG/Philips and put their brand name on it with their own sauce in it. If you have to replace LCD for $500 when this tv's lcd breaks down after 18 months, don't you think the same lcd goes on a Sony/Panasonic set would work longer than 18 months? Have you read reviews on more expensive brand name LCD HDTV? You will see alot of out of warranty problems too. I can't say much about Syntax's customer support service, so I can rate their service quality but base on all the reviews I read in here, I will stay skeptical. Of course I won't be able to rate them either since my TV is already out of warranty. I do recommend you to get a Harmony remote.

Miller", "ReviewID": "R31KCPXKMRCZP2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having never seen a truly objective review of the screen, I thought I'd add my review.  I own a 37HVE which only lacks the ATSC hi-def tuner from the 37HVS.  If you don't need 480 progressive (see below), or good vga support, then it's a very good television set at a fantastic price.Pros480i/720p/1080i look great on television.Speakers produce good sound.Lots of inputs.Heavy and big and wide with attached speakers.  Black bezel is nicely hides wall.  Really focuses your attention on the screen.Cons1) 480 progressive mode is broken (which Xbox 360 defaults to for dvd playback).  Looks like the video circuitry doesn't align the scanline fields properly so I a variable 100 pixel shift.  This shift converges and then separates, making the screen unreadable.  This happens for my PS2 and Xbox with component cables.  Had to run in 480i mode on those units, but I don't have 480i option for dvd playback on the 360.2) Sketchy warranty support.  Warranty states that you may only get in-house service if you register within 30 days of product purchase.  See 3).3) Even if you do write in for warranty support, or call them and get a code, they have not yet returned replies.4) Amazon freight company took away the box without even asking, making it impossible to redeem the rebate (or return the product).  Amazon policy is to only take returns before 30 days, so now that I found out about the 480p, I am basically stuck with hoping for warranty support.5) No real color adjustment.  Defaults seem to be the only usable settings.6) VGA connection never synches to a 16:9 1360x760 signal.  Best I could achieve was a 1024x768 stretched image.  This means photos, movies look stretched when displayed.  Other resolutions were either letterboxed, or stretched badly.

They dont have any of these tv's, so they want to substitute it with an LG372CD. Not even in the same ball park. If I wanted a cheap crappy lcd tv with very little features, i would have waited til i got home and went to wally world. They tried to convince my wife it was a much better tv and was a huge upgrade. When she relayed to them that i am not a crackhead they were going to take advantage of, they offered a zenith instead. I still wasnt buying that load. So i had my wife call amazon customer service and ask if it was standard practice for 3rd parties to advertise and sell items on amazon that they dont have. And they said it wasnt there problem, we had to deal with the tv store. So now i will never buy anything from amazon ever again. And the tv store treated us to a free downgrade to the LT237HVS. How nice of them, now i am left with only 1 hdmi input, and a much cheaper and older tv with less features than the one i paid for.

The remote sucks horribly, the TV is also slow to react to the remote, the other negative is there is a blue light on the front, real bright, stays on constantly.

They said it sounded like a problem that required a new TV and they would ship one out. They did rather quickly and it showed up the next week. I was very eager to have what I thought was a good TV now, and unpacked it. Once plugged in.....the NIGHTMARE began.

Then the delivery folks unpacked the panel and took the packaging away. I was able to connect a HDTV antenna and receive several HDTV channels OTA. Picture was excellent. I only had to adjust HUE and Saturation to get a perfect picture. The next day the remote stopped working. I changed the batteries but it didn't make a difference. The light on the remote lights up, when I press the buttons, however the Panel does not respond.

What that means is you have to use two remotes, and if this isn't bad enough - when you call comcast up to get a signal, they won't/can't do it.  So here's where I am now - and I've had the TV for about two weeks now:  No picture, after watching a DVD, I'm unable to switch it back to TV mode.  Because there's no companion remote to do it on.  After several long minutes with the Comcast tech, trying to get her to just send me a signal, I couldn't take it anymore.  I asked for a tech to come to the house, and got an appointment for 11/7.  So another week goes by with no picture.
