{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very pleased so far. *EDITED*", "Author": "Irishlady", "ReviewID": "R2VEZPV1ATMLN2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I guess I'll break the ice and be the first to review this TV.I searched for a decent 37\" TV at a reasonable price and looked at several different brands. I almost bought a Vizio because of the price, but then I found this Toshiba for less than 600$. Here is what I can say about it so far:This TV has a very good picture especially on the Directv hi-def channels. It has some interesting features that I have not yet used such as:the ability to play picture files (like a giant digital photo frame, andthe ability to play MUSIC files, like a giant Mp3 player.When I press the \"mute\" (to mute the sound)button, it will mute half way, then another press of the button mutes the sound completely.It has a computer terminal for connecting a PC.It has 4 HDMI inputs.The reason I gave this TV 4 stars is the viewing angles--like most LCDs, you need to sit almost directly in front of the screen. If you try and watch it too far off to one side, the colors get a bit washed out.For an auxillary TV, this one fits the bill. My home theatre TV is a 50\" plasma, and that TV blows this one away. But if you just want a fairly large TV for everyday watching and not the whole \"home theatre\" experience, you will be pleased with this unit. I think Toshiba is a decent brand and most of the reviews on other Toshiba models have been pretty good.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS TV LIKE A SON!!!", "Author": "SteveB", "ReviewID": "R3Q0EVXUMP7V0K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV to replace my Samsung 27\" tube HDTV which was an absolute beast (147 lbs!).  This TV is WONDERFUL!  It's the 3rd Toshiba LCD in my house (also have a 32\" in my bedroom and a 19\" in the home office).  The picture is crystal clear with rich, bright, vibrant colors.  I watch a lot of sports and play video games on this TV and it performs great for both.  There aren't noticeable tracers when watching fast action.  I wish it had a regular a/v sound output (red & white), but it only offers a digital audio output which doesn't work w/ my out-dated receiver (not the TV's fault).  I compared this side-by-side to LG's similarly priced 37\" model and it blew the LG away.  The picture was brighter, clearer, and lost less quality at an angle.  I've noticed some reviews that are critical of the TV's sound, but I'm not having any issues with it.  I'm sure it doesn't compare to the sound quality of a home theatre system, but it isn't any worse than any other TV I've owned.  If you're looking to get the most bang for your buck on a moderately priced lcd TV, this is the one.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Mike V", "ReviewID": "R1FNI7V2VPC5KL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll keep this one short and sweet. Ive had this TV for several weeks now, and couldn't be happier.The picture is awesome. Our other TV is a Samsung 40 inch, which is another highly rated LCD, and I made my own comparison by watching a Stanley Cup Hockey game on both TV's and could not tell any difference. A Hockey game broadcast in HD is a very good test for your TV's clarity, and this Toshiba did not disappoint.The dynamic aspect ratio works great.The fact that Toshiba doesn't publish the contrast ratio should not be a deterrent for getting this TV. Contrast ratio is a marketing gimmick, and the determination should be that if you look at the picture, and it looks great to your eyes, who cares what the actual contrast ratio is? The blacks look black, and the whites look white, and there isn't much more to worry about.Good price for a great TV!", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just got this HD TV yesterday...WOW!", "Author": "Mark B.

I plugged all of my things into it, turned it on, and there were all these horizontal lines going across it, making the picture all messed up.  i called customer service and they had me call a local company to fix it.  local company came by the next day to pick it up.  they told me it was the screen, and that they'd have to order that in, which would take about 10 days.  so Ive now owned this thing for about a week and cant even watch it until it gets fixed, which will be just in time for me to leave town for the holidays.  im definitely not happy with this purchase.  i sure hope i have no problems with it after i get it back.*UPDATE*I am returning this television today.  Toshiba's customer service has been giving me the run around on getting this thing fixed, and I'm unable to put up with it any longer.  I bought this on Cyber Monday, and still haven't been able to use it.  Their customer service kept losing my paperwork, so no one has been able to answer my questions as to why I haven't been able to get my tv back yet.  Finally I get a call back (after at least a week of being told that, whoops, we lost your paperwork, someone eill definitely be calling you back today) from a \"manager\" (unprofessional sounding and insincere) who told me that the part I need is on indefinite backorder.  I asked her why they just won't send me a new once, since I didn't break it, and it didn't work from the very moment I plugged it in.  She told me that isn't an option and I have to get it fixed by them.  I told them I don't want a refurbished television when I paid for a brand new one.  She wasn't really happy with my opinion.  So, I'm sending it back to Amazon.  I went and picked it up from the local repair company and it is on its way to Amazon as we speak.  Thank you Amazon, for having no problems with this return, especially when I've gotten such a run-around from Toshiba.  I will never buy another product from them again!", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV...Horrible shipping", "Author": "lawguy20", "ReviewID": "R3IWJY754EG00B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let first comment on the TV...its fantastic! Great picture in either standard or high def. The sound is great as well. I replaced a 4 year old 32in Westinghouse and this just blows it away. Absolutely no complaints about the TV.Now, as far as shipping goes...I can't believe Amazon uses these people. The company is called Ceva Logistics. These people were the most unprofessional individuals I have ever delt with (when it comes to shipping companies). I see my package is due to be delivered on the 4th...ok sounds good. It didn't come. Fine, I now the estimates are usually just that...an estimate. So I check the status and I see that the package is at the destination location (about 7 miles from where I  live). So, i figure it would come the next day (friday). Well, I'm at work and i get a call asking if I want to come pick up my TV from the distribution center...what?!? I ordered it online and wanted it delivered. That is what Amazon is all about...ordering from your computer to your door. Neither me nor my wife have cars (we rely on public transit and bikes) so picking it up was not an option. They tell me that since I can't pick it up myself that I'll have to wait until monday and schedule a delivery appointment....when asked why they couldn't just deliver it because my wife would be home they got an attitude and  said \"thats not how we do things\". So I asked to schedule an appointment and he told me to call back monday....seriously, the TV had been there now for 2 days! So Monday rolls around and I call to make and appointment and they give me a four hour window between 10-2pm. So when does my TV get delivered? 2:45. I have never had so much trouble getting a package in my life....I hope Amazon stops using these people!", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Quality HDTV", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R186O0RKT5DLRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I purchased my hdtv, i did plenty of research, and compared many tvs. I really had my eye on a samsung 37 in. but the price was a little out of budget for me. I saw a toshiba like this one in an electronic store and liked the picture quality, but hated the actual design of the tv. It looked cheesy and I wasnt sure how it would hold up in the long run. After months of deciding which tv i wanted, I saw the toshiba discounted here, and on impulse purchased it, and haven't looked back since. The look of the tv has since grown on me, and the quality of the picture is stunning and definitely comparable to other more expensive tvs. The sound quality is like any other hdtv with built in speakers, but by no means do they sound bad. The glossy screen is not best for day time watching with sun in the room, but in the dark, I think the glossy screen gives the picture a better warmer color which is awesome! The 1080p cant be beat, and it has plenty of hdmi imports for bluray, cable etc, also the 60 hz looks just right to me, not too fast and not too slow, to me tvs with 120hz true-motion just look too fast moving for my liking.  I highly recommend this tv to any indecisive buyers like my self who are looking for something affordable, and not too big for bedroom or living room use.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can't imagine a more versatile HDTV that's a better value!!", "Author": "S. Gerber \"samthewebman\"", "ReviewID": "R2N6KQ7W491HEX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I only write Amazon Reviews when I have strong feelings toward or against a product. This review is DEFINITELY a positive one.Have had this Toshiba for three weeks now. MY first HDTV, replacing a 27\" very competent Sony 27\" WEGA.Like all of you I wanted a great picture, great sound, good value, a good brand from a trusted well known manufacturer, and especially in my case, I wanted a high level of connectivity. I have a VCR that's attached by composite video cables, and ditto with a DVD player. Also, I want the ability to watch a different program while I'm taping a program. This will be the keynote of this review.The Comcast cable coming to my bedroom was split. One cable attached to their cable box and the other cable to nothing. (Too cheap and principled to buy 2 cable boxes for a single TV). To make this work I had an A-B switch to select the cable to be used and feed it to the Sony's Cable/Antenna input.The Toshiba was so rich in connectivity with 2 composite inputs, one component, and 4 HDMI that it solved all my connectivity issues without an A-B switch and with full and automatic support for my legacy, low-res (480i) devices. If you're still interested at all, here's what I did:My Comcast Hi-Def cable box is HDMI connected. It feeds my VCR for taping. The VCR connects to the Toshiba on composite input, as does the DVD player. Comcast supplied me with a no-charge digital adapter for cable input to the Toshiba's Cable/Antenna input. It's called a DTA device (Digital Transport Adapter). The magic of this is that the DTA can unscramble the many non-analog broadcasts so that it can deliver the entire channel lineup I'm paying for, not just the 7 local channels available without it. The piece de resistance is that both the cable box and the DTA are tuned by remote controls that do NOT conflict with each other. The only sacrifice I made is that when my hi-def box is occupied doing a taping, I can only watch standard def on the DTA, a small price to pay to avoid having to buy a second cable box or a 2-tuner DVR. Standard def is very sharp on the Toshiba, as it was on my Sony WEGA.The Toshiba has a very easy-to-use feature set which allows me to select automatic aspect ratio recognition, as well as a manual override to use full width for standard def (which I hate) and a choice of 3 \"Theater\" modes. I have it set where everything is automatic. My VCR is always recognized as 480i and I have right and left edges with a 4:3 aspect ratio. Ditto when I play a DVD. When I watch TV broadcasts the low-def stations are always seen as 4:3 and the hi-def as 16:9, no user setting required. As a bonus, when I play a 16:9 formatted movie on DVD, I can quickly use one of the theater modes to fill the Toshiba's massive screen. No Blu_Ray required.Sorry for boring those of you who aren't so anal about wanting all these features but this Toshiba screamed at me \"I'm the TV you want!\".For those Comcast users among you who want to do what I'm doing, I'll supply model numbers for the Hi-Def Cable box and the DTA if you request this by commenting the review.Haven't tried the USB and PC inputs yet, but I plan to bring my laptop into play so that I can use it to stream Netflix videos to the TV. I don't want to waste my TV playing MP3 music or watch JPG slide shows.Sorry for the long review but don't pass up this Toshiba if you want a great picture, totally acceptable sound, and a myriad of connectivity options.Thanks for reading ...

I am very pleased with the size and clarity from 10 feet away. I like watching and reading news items on the pc and this unit makes it most pleasant with tri-focal glasses. I had a 15 inch tube monitor and found my eyes tiring after a short time. The 37 inch size makes viewing very comfortable.I bought this at a store after reading all the Amazon reviews on various monitor/tv units. It has so many inputs that were new to me that I felt that telling the seller what I needed it for was the only way to get my money worth.This is what I wanted in a unit:A PC monitorConnect my Roku ( Netflix ) HD wireless converterTv channel viewingConnect my analog vcrget rid of my external pc speakersThese desires were met and by buying a wireless keyboard and mouse I now have the pc box under the TV and out of sight.The monitor has a matte finish and does not reflect glare from my windows during the day. This might be the feature I most appreciate.Set-up was very easy.I looked at the unit from 30 feet away at an angle and was able to see the picture just fine. What angle I look at in my living room is not an issue. This is an LCD screen.It has 1080 resolution and Netflix delivers at 780 so I can upgrade my Roku and still be pleased with my unit.It has 5 settings for picture warmth ( color/hue/gamma/etc ). 4 of these settings are factory set and non-changeable and the 5th for personal preference.I use an outdoor digital antenna and as I change channels the Toshiba indicates the strength of the signal. The unit does not have an antenna built in. You must use a cable style antenna or cable service.My analog vcr is now useless for recording without a digital converter box and can't record shows without a converter. Also my previously recorded vcr tapes come on the TV in 480 resolution.It will accept a USB flash device. If you have mp3 or jpg files or want to view the pictures from your camera ( camera cable required with rgb or usb external connection ) you can have a slide show.The HDMI inputs look very similar to a usb connection but the shape is different. All the newer pc's and other devices are coming with this commection. It replaces the s-cable style connector it does not accept s-cable.I had to buy an HDI cable ( connect my Roku ), a stereo speaker cable ( from the pc headphones to the monitor ) with both ends male, and a VGA cable ( computer ) in addition to the unit itself.

However, I think I can help out the average consumer...I bought this TV for my girlfriend and she LOVES it! I was looking for a decent size LCD with 1080p capabilities, lots of ports, and as for the HZ I prefer 60 myself so I wasn't too concerned about that, and of course, overall, I just wanted the biggest bang for my buck.I researched and compared tons of different models and brands based on what I was looking for and this TV not only met all of my standards, but even exceeded some (4 hdmi ports!).  I couldn't find a better deal out there considering this TV is 37 inches, has plenty of hdmi ports, 1080p, and the set itself looks really good.  This TV is sleek and one of the best looking(aesthetically speaking) models I could find in its category.My gf mostly uses this TV to hook up to her Macbook Pro as an additional monitor or uses the Macbook as a DVD player. I got her a DVI to hdmi cable to hook her computer up to the TV and it looks amazing.  I was extremely impressed with the quality of the picture on the television.Although, I am extremely pleased with this purchase, there are a couple of little things that do bother me about the TV..1. The remote looks cheap and plain - however my gf likes it because it's simple and the buttons are big, haha2. As with a lot of LCD TVs and their remotes, the remote has to be pretty accurately pointed at the sensor on the TV for the TV to respond to the remote.  That's just annoying to me even though it's a common issue.3. The TV is a little slow to respond to switching between different inputs or channels.  I don't think this TV is any slower than most (other than your high end models), but it's still just one of those annoying factors.4.  Another issue with a lot a lcd televisions including this one, the sound could be better.  The sound isn't terrible or anything, it is adequate.  It's just if you really want to enjoy a good action packed movie or show, though, you'll want to purchase some speakers - I did.5. There is no swivel stand, which isn't a huge deal.  I don't mind turning the whole set to get a better viewing angle.All in all, this TV is a great purchase if you are looking for a medium sized LCD television for a casual, enhanced experience.  The picture is great, the color levels are vibrant, the size is awesome, there are plenty of inputs/outputs, it's 1080p, and the TV itself is one of the best looking sets in its category.  Of course this TV isn't meant to be the main attraction in your home theater setup.. but you know that already.  From my research and comparisons, this TV is your best deal by far for its category and it definitely gets its job done.  JR.com sold it to me for $450.00, shipped it to me quick (free shipping at that), and even added some extra packing material inside to make sure it arrived in mint condition.

Like most reviews everything was fine except the sound was indeed flat as expected. So I thought I would just connect it to my old- but- still- very stylish, mini Panasonic stereo system which still provides great surround sound. Lo and behold, it turns out I'm the dinosaur in not keeping up with technology. The Toshiba did not allow me to connect the Red and White RCA cables to the TV. There is only a \"DIGITAL AUDIO OUTPUT\".  Here is where a tech saavy boyfriend does come in handy.Hence after significant more research and phone calls, I was out of luck. Sadly I had to return the television although it was at a great price. But I insisted on NOT buying a new stereo system which cost on average $200-$300. So I ended up with a Samsung 40\" even larger TV for $579 at Best Buy and it has the connections for my old stereo. So everything worked out in the end. The lesson learned is that I had to research the manuals online for TVs (in order to have clear visual of all the connection in back of the TV) and Samsung is the best for providing this easily and readily online. I was leaning toward an LG but they do not readily have manuals online.

They really didnt seem to care that I had barely gotten 2 years out of this tv.  I asked if this was a recurring problem & they said no (of course).  Took it to the repair shop & was told the main board & power supply were both bad & it would cost $400 to fix (only paid $600 for the tv).  Called Toshiba back to express my great disapointment in the quality of the tv & was told that ALL lcd tv's are very complex & there is no guaranteed life on any brand.  I told the guy then I would rather pay $350 for another brand that may or may not last over 2 years instead of $600 for a Toshiba.  Better to spend $350 every couple of years than $600.

I won't buy another Toshiba product.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "37.6-inch LCD HDTV with Full 1080p HD resolution; slimming tapered bezel and attractive front panel Horizon design gradation\nDynaLight backlight control adjusts for deeper black levels for higher dynamic contrast and more realistic picture\nPhoto Frame capability for showing off your digital photo slideshows; USB connection for playing MP3 digital audio\nInputs: 4 HDMI, 1 component, 2 composite, 1 PC, 1 USB, 1 optical digital audio output\nIncludes removable stand; measures 36.40 x 26.00 x 11.61 inches with stand\n1080P Full High-Definition Cinespeed Display\nDynalight Dynamic Backlight Control For Deep Black Levels\nGaming Mode For Fast Game Controller Response\nPhoto Frame Capability & Mp3 Playback Via Usb", "Name": "Toshiba 37E200U 37-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LCD HDTV (Black Gloss)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PdOg6ECmL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0038JED76"}}
