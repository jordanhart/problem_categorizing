{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Absolutely stunning TV!", "Author": "Dmitry P.", "ReviewID": "R148KGNKHR0HZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV does fantastic job up-scaling 1080p or 1080i content to 4K. All the worries about native 4K Content nearly non-existent can be put to rest. The unscaled picture of this TV is so much superior to regular Full HD that it definitely justifies extra money here. Plus it will look even better once the actual 4K content arrives. Other than that it has every feature you can find on higher end LG TVs.From what I read online LG claims to have better up-scaling technology than the competition, but after seeing this TV in store and then later at home, that can certainly be the case. With all the negative reviews in press regarding 4K, I was very skeptical about it, but after finally taking the chance, I can say this is the best purchase I made in years. By comparison the picture quality on this TV makes 1080p TVs look like 480p TV 7 years ago when 1080p first arrived. It's just so much better. And you don't need to sit 10 or less feet away to be able to tell. From 20-25 feet you can still tell the better picture quality, higher resolution results not just in more detail, but also higher depth of color and more contents filling the screen. This TV does all the up scaling, you don't need extra up-scaling player or any other accessories.I've tested TV with PS4, PS3, 3D Bluray player, and Comcast HD TV box. All that content was up-scaled to 4K. Movies and games look super detailed. You'd want to re-watch every movie you have after getting this. 5 stars no doubt.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "This TV is AMAZING!", "Author": "R. Bundy", "ReviewID": "R1PBWCXJSAMRUT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even though there is no 4K content available right now, there will be soon. Enjoy 4K now with this TVs upscaler which provides a crystal clear picture. There is only one con to this TV: the remote is the worst thing that has ever been created. If someone proposed the idea of a Wii remote style TV remote to me, I would have laughed in their face. The remote also has this scroll roller like on a mouse and every time you accidentally scroll, it pops up a message to set up your cable or satellite to the TV remote so you can change the channel with it (which is worse because it changes the channel when you accidentally scroll). Get ready for 4K guys! the Blu-Ray Disc Association has already said it is on the way!***************IF YOU HAVE A RECEIVER THAT SENDS SOUND TO SPEAKERS, MAKE SURE TO DELAY THE AUDIO IN THE SETTINGS BECAUSE THE UPSCALER SLOWS THE PICTURE DOWN AND CAUSES THE AUDIO TO BE AHEAD OF THE VIDEO (if you will be using the TV speakers, you are fine because the TV delays it for you) **************************", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really great TV!", "Author": "chillhuman \"music collector\"", "ReviewID": "RKWFWWXKOZGJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This past weekend my wife and I went shopping for TVs. We tried several places, and after a lot of research I had originally wanted to buy a Samsung F8000. We went to the store to check one out, and this TV was next to the F8000 on end displays. I considered the LG because of the super crisp video they were showing on the LG but I knew that this was a marketing gimmick since most video isn't close to this resolution. After doing a side by side comparison of the software on each set, the remotes, and the picture of each from the same feed we decided to go with the LG over the Samsung. So far we're super pleased with our purchase. We watched a few movies on it, did youtube streaming, and I spent an hour playing Wii on it. No complaints. In a dark room movies are really visually stunning, and all the internet connectivity works fine. Very easy to set up and use. The out of the box settings made the image look too much like soap operas, but after playing around with the picture settings it looks great.My only complaint is that the TV is just a touch too big for the room. When it's not on it dominates the room. This has nothing to do with the TV though.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG 55LA9650 Ultra HD", "Author": "Michael Snow", "ReviewID": "R2R4ZP7L7QFUSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received yesterday so far I have liked using the remote since it allows moving the on screen cursor by just moving your arm and not having to make multiple pushs on the remote. I have had remote buttons in the past that have worn out from this. Have a Samsung BD-F7500 4K Upscaling 3D Wi-Fi Blu-ray Disc Player that works great with with this TV viewing 3D and 2D discs (makes it a new experience watching these again). There are a few Ultra HD You Tube videos to stream that look great as well. Plan to use this as well with a PC for gaming at high resolution (not at 4K however, video cards are too expensive plus per my understanding HDMI 2.0 has not yet been implemented on this unit for 60 HZ refresh). The sound does not surpass a good surround system however I was surprised with the amount of volume and fullness without any buzzing or rattling. This TV with all of the included extras made a better choice for me versus a dedicated smaller Ultra HD computer monitor. This unit makes video life-like by comparison to my previous DLP rear projection set that looks great on 2D but 3D contrast suffered. .", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very neat picture", "Author": "Piyush Rohatgi", "ReviewID": "R3P1PIY0Y0DVD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV a month ago and am very glad with it .

Not that this Sony is faulty, it still working fine but there some burnt mark on it. The Sony Bravia has been great to me most of the time till now. Convert this LCD TV to a PLAYSTION SCREEN (PS4, XBOX 360 and WII)Firstly in my mind, I wanted to own the Samsung the 55\" F8000 series. I went to Best Denki and the salesman recommended me to opt for LG 55LA9650 a 4k LED TV. The comparison was done side by side on Picture, 3D and Airplay.Picture: 4k totally beat the best Full HD as if you are comparing day and night. 4K LED TV outclass the full HD in a distance. For those who had negative about 4K TV simply you are NUTz in the brain or blind. 4K TV is the evolution TV in the future. There will no more FHD tv, nobody buy back dated technology. If you have the money it is worth to purchase it. YOU WILL TO \u201camaze \u201cBY THE PICTURE QUALITY.3D: Again the Full HD never come closer to 4K tv, The picture was superb that it give you 1080p.Airplay: One thing that a bit flop to me, it has dual core comparing the Samsung with Quad core.Overall, I have no regret to purchase the 4K TV, I SWEAR IT WORTH TO BUY IF YOU HAVE EXTRA CASH.Attn. to user name MEEE: Pls not to review something that is NOT true, if you can\u2019t afford it just say so.Those GIANT TV maker spent millions of dollar on the RND and  it is gimmick?

The only way to make this TV look good is by playing 4K demos that are unrealistically enhanced and guess what?  That's not what comes on TV and will not for the near future.  When the tv is playing the same content as high end 1080p Sony, Samsung, and LG it only looks as good or worse in some cases.  It's upscaling makes it look very fuzzy and the remote is way to much of a gimmick.I'm not against 4K but go to your local Best Buy and ask them to get this TV to play the same image as a Samsung F8000 1080p TV if you do not believe me.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,299.00", "Features": "ULTRA HD is the future of picture quality attaining a resolution four times that of FULL HD, with a stunning 8.3 million pixels displaying flawless pictures even from close distances.
