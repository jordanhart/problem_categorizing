I decided to try the Samsung 40 inch LED HDTV capable of 3D after watching a number of different sets from a number of different manufacturers. I specifically avoided the Plasma type TVs due to the large amount of Radio Frequency Interference that they generate. The Samsung TV has a beautiful bright Clear color picture and meets all of my expectations!! On black and white shows, the picture is almost too good as it is very crisp! On 3D movies, using the required 3D glasses, the picture is just plain astounding!!!!! It feels like you are in the middle of the action. For the price, the 40 inch Samsung is highly recommended as a BEST BUY by me!!! If you want to watch 3D blu-ray movies, you must purchase the 3D specific Blu-Ray player from Samsung, as well as the Samsung 3D  glasses. Not inexpensive,but well worth the money!!

The TV is pretty much everything I would expect from Samsung.  Great styling, amazingly thin and light and a first class picture.  I can't comment on the 3D picture because I haven't tried it yet (there isn't much 3D programming around at this point but it's nice to be \"future proof\").  I would have given it five stars but one of the TVs key features -- Samsung's Internet TV -- is clunky at best and web streaming of movies from Netflix does NOT work at all.  After hours on the phone to Samsung and Netflix support I finally got everyone to agree that the Netflix feature just doesn't work with these TVs.  Supposedly a software upgrade is in the works but no one would even give me an estimated date.If Internet TV is your main driver for buying a new Samsung set I would advise waiting a while, this technology isn't yet ready for Broadway!", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "VERY NICE TV!!!", "Author": "hello \"hi\"", "ReviewID": "RUHQ7NQDETUCL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THIS IS AN EXTREMELY GOOD TV WITH NICE COLOR AND CONTRAST.

Probably the best picture I've seen anywhere.  I wish I could say the same for the balance of the features.Internet Connectivity:  The Samsung was very particular about connecting to the internet.  I had one connection that was tested on a laptop that worked fine not be able to deliver an IP address using DHCP to the set.Internet Apps:  Save your money here and go get an Apple TV for $99!  The Netflix app didn't work out of the box and the other apps were less than stellar.  Not worth the money.Check your ports:  We started with the cable box and a DVD player and everything connected fine.  But when we connected to HDMI port 3, no device would work on the connection.  HDMI 4 worked fine and everything was running but it will mean a service call.  (we'll let you know how that went later).More ports:  Another thing about the ports mounted on the side, make sure you get a 28AWG based HDMI cable to connect otherwise it will be difficult to hide the cables behind the set AND it feels like the ports would be susceptible to breaking if you tried to force the cables to bend.Software update:  Did contact tech support about the HDMI port issue.  They sent an update file which by the way wasn't available through software update on the TV.  Seems that we should be able to rely on the software update for ANY issues otherwise what's the point.3D:  Haven't had a chance to get to 3D yet, will give you an update when we get there.Sound:  The sound quality and capabilities are fairly good.  Sitting 10 feet away the quality of the sound is clear and plenty loud.  Always a concern especially on the really thin LED TV's.Overall the core functions of the TV have satisfied but you may want to reconsider paying for all of those other options and features.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung still working out the 3D bugs", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R2FETM9L39B34X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is an exceptional 2D set with poor quality 3D capabilities.  I purchased a Samsung Blu-ray DVD and the expensive Samsung glasses.  The movie they ship with the unit was used as well and the 3D quality just wasn't there.  I was sorely disappointed with the blurred 3D image, almost as if you had not activated the glasses.  After service replaced the main board as well as the 'T-Con' board multiple times, they determined that the unit 'appears to work as intended' even though they agreed the blurred image was not right.  I unfortunately had purchased Samsung's UN65C8000 and their UN55C8000 3D TV's as well.  All have the exact same issue.  Even more disappointing than the 3D picture quality was Samsung's \"Executive Support Team\" which determined that \"we're sorry, but the unit appears to be working as designed and there's nothing we can do for you.\"For my money, I'd strongly suggest looking at other brands to determine if anyone has truly nailed 3D yet.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture!!", "Author": "jxo106", "ReviewID": "R3NYI9GPP2WYX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This picture is so clear that when I watch a football game, I can count the blades of grass!

The sound isn't the greatest, but who doesn't hook up their tv to a home theater system?? The 3D feature is really cool.  It doesn't so much jump out at you when you watch, rather inside, the set gains depth.  I watched a half of basketball on christmas and it made it exciting.  Do yourself a favor and get the package with the glasses and blu ray dvd player.  The 2d to 3d feature isn't quite as good as the regular 3d versions. It's ok but nothing to write home about.

I don't get it, if some people don't/can't have something they just knock it (I guess that justifies it in their minds)?  I guess a lot of people have already bought HDTV's by the time 3DTVs came out but I was a hold out with my old Sony Trinitron tv. I was ready to upgrade to a regular HDTV.  I wasn't considering 3D, until after talking to a friend who was raving about it for gaming.  My experience with 3D prior to buying this TV was the occasional 3D movie, which was cool but not enough for me to get my own 3DTV.  But gaming in 3D?  That sounded sweet.  I decided to spend a little more to get a 3DTV and this Samsung looked better than the others at the store, the price was also nice.  They didn't have PS3 3D game demos in the stores, why?  (I think they'd sell more 3DTVs if people gotta first hand look at games in 3D).  Anyway after hooking up my PS3 with my HDMI cable to my new TV at home, and powering on the glasses I was blown away!  I couldn't believe the picture I was seeing, it was like another world inside the screen that came to life with an incredible amount of depth.  Better quality than the 3D at the movies (this tv is high quality active stereoscopic 3D, not passive, nor the gimmicky red/green glasses kind).  These games are amazing: Super Stardust HD, Motorstorm 3d Rift, Call of Duty Black Ops online multiplayer in 3D!!!  Can't put it down, and there's a lot more 3D compatible games available now and coming out in the future.  The only downside is I don't enjoy 2D games anymore that I used to really like, can't stand the lack of depth in 2D.  I only buy/play 3D games on my PS3 now.3d movies also look really good (can also play right through the regular PS3), but there's not too many available and I have no idea where u can rent them but all the Shreks that came with the TV look really cool in 3D.  Regular Blu-Rays are also stunning.HDTV channels also look awesome through this TV.  I think because it's a 3DTV it has to have really high performance so 2DHD is going to look stellar too.  This TV can convert 2D to 3D but it's kind of gimmicky, stick to the authentic 3D stuff for 3D.  Non HD channels also look good, but if you have HD option, why watch non HD?  Streaming Netflix over wifi is super smooth, great picture too, disc quality.The 3D glasses are great (SSG2100AB), the battery last for months with heavy use and they fit nicely over my eyeglasses, but they're kinda of expensive so don't sit on them accidently (luckily this TV came with 2 pairs so I gotta backup)Overall I think this is a great TV, I highly recommend it.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN40C7000 40-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV", "Author": "Byron Vega", "ReviewID": "R1BPXSKI9HWFG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great 3D LED TV.

My experience so far has been very positive. Setup was easy and fairly straight-forward. The instructions are very clear about how to connect everything for most setups. The remote works well and can light up in the dark, which can be useful (although I haven't used it much). The picture itself is quite good. There is some minor brightness variation around the corners, but I don't find it noticeable most of the time. The webapps that come with the tv are pretty good. I have used Amazon's on-demand service, Netflix and a couple of other apps. This tv can stream high def content, which looks great. For some reason, these apps are split between Yahoo apps and Samsung apps, which means that Netflix and Pandora are on completely different menus than Amazon's service (it took me a while to find the Yahoo apps). This is a relatively minor gripe. Also note that if you intend to use WiFi, you will require a dongle sold separately. The 3D functionality works well, however there is not currently a lot of 3D content out there. The 2D to 3D conversion works quite well; it is subtle, but looks good. However, it turns off every time the tv changes modes (ie a SD commercial comes on) so I would not recommend using it on tv broadcasts.

I originally had purchased a UN40C6400 series from Sams Club.  That purchase was easy as they had aligned all of the 120hz+ TV's along one rack attached to individual Blu-ray's.  The Samsung's crisp clarity, smooth motion, and black blacks, made buying any other brand a non-option.  That TV found its way to my patents where they still marvel and exclaim positive remarks over its picture.This model the Samsung UN40C7000 is better in all areas when compared to the 6 series.  The 240hz, ensures crisp smooth motion, the contrast provides even deeper blacks.  This TV is a dream.  One feature which I find outstanding in the newer models is the reduction in MPEG conpression artifacts.  The removal of these makes the picture on the LCD-LED TV's much clearer than my Pioneer KURO plasma TV.  Even Low Def TV looks clear and crisp, with minimal up-scaling artifacts.Since the unit didn't come with 3D glasses, did try the 3d effect until a set arrived.  3D off of Directv via the Samsung looks pretty good, I'll use it every now and then, but not as my preferred viewing choice.  In simulated 3D mode, it worked OK.  Not a feature I'll be using much, not because of lack of quality, but no need to watch the news in 3D.About the only negative aspects would be the slimline connectors that replace the Ethernet port, and RCA ports.  The thin nature of this TV makes it difficult to find space for the full sized connectors.An annoyance found in both Samsung's was the inability to wake the TV to any source outside of the coax or usb slot.  Personally I like setting the TV up as an Alarm clock, but for those that use cable or satellite boxes,using those devices as the input are not an option in Alarm mode.Great series of TV's", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung is the best", "Author": "Edward Seese", "ReviewID": "REX2INC8EQCH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV.

Fortunately, the \"dongle\" was a free add-on.  I understand that the new Samsung models that are about to come out have built-in wi-fi, which looks better then a protruding \"dongle\" and makes more sense.I am not crazy about where the cables plug into the TV because, instead of my being able to route them invisibly, they have to be folded back on themselves in order to route them as invisibly as possible.  Considering the typical 6' length of HDMI cables, the extra length needed to accomplish this routing is not always practical without having had purchased extra long cables.  I can understand the design difficulty in this area, since if the unit is affixed to a wall it would be difficult to get to more centrally located connectors that would negate having to route them in this manner.When you turn it on (by remote control only because there is no ON switch on the TV) it takes about 10 seconds before any noticeable indication that it is turning on... except, on closer inspection, the red light that remains on when the TV is off goes dark when turning on and 10 seconds later a musical sequence is played, followed by the TV switching on.I also wish that the stand allowed the TV to be adjusted for tilt but it only allows a limited amount of side to side adjustment.  The built in tilt appears to hold the TV with the top of it back about 5 degrees more then the bottom.  Because in my setup the TV is high up, I would prefer to be able to tilt it about 5 degrees in the opposite direction (pointing slightly down).The remote looks cool, feels sturdy and has some raised indicators but those raised elements are not enough to distinguish one button from another by touch alone.  Perhaps in time that will change.The built-in Yahoo widget ability is interesting and I like that it is evolving and the TV will be able to take advantage of that.  I was very pleasantly surprised to learn that I can watch TWIT TV and see Leo Leport's CES coverage at no extra cost!  The streamed video often pauses to let the wireless connection catch up.  Ideally this TV should be wire connected to the Internet despite my having mentioned the \"dongle\".That said, The picture is great, the sound is pretty good and I love this TV!", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Was worried about size and 3D, but works great!", "Author": "T.

I was worried that the 3D effect and 1080p wouldn't work well for me as my couch is a bit far back from the TV, but at about 9-10ft I can say that the 3D works wonderfully based on Shrek 2. I was surprised when watching it that everything is in 3D, the entire scene, which was very cool.As for the rest of the TV. Sound is pretty good. Not outstanding, but certainly better than most TVs without a soundbar. I had some initial problems with input lag when using the xbox 360 over component (I don't have the hdmi versions), but I switched to VGA and that removed all input lag. Overall the picture quality has been amazing. Might want to lower a couple settings or choose natural/movie to decrease the brightness (it looks great in standard, but hurt my eyes after too much of it).Overall I'm very pleased and looking forward to enjoying it over the holidays.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Nice T.V.!!", "Author": "J.

Very rich and deep colors.My reason for the review is Amazon's  shipping.  This is the first time I have ordered anything big from Amazon and was disappointed in Amazon's shipping and customer service after the order.  I had picked the super saver shipping knowing that it would take 5 to 9 day for the shipping.  When I ordered the set, Amazons web page said the TV was in stock.  I figured that the set would ship the next day and then the 5 to 9 day shipping but that is not even close.  Even though Amazon said that the TV was in stock, they did not ship it until 7 days later and then add the 5 to 9 days for the shipping.  It was 2 weeks before I received the TV.  When I ordered my stuff, Amazon told me right away that the 3D kit would be delayed and that still showed up before the TV that was in \"STOCK\".  Customer service could not or would not give me a date of when Amazon would ship the TV.  This caused me trouble with the dish install and messed that all up.  I did get the whole order of the BlueRay player, 3D kit, and TV for 1449.00 but trying to schedule this order and a dish install was hopeless with Amazon's slow handling at their end of shipping.  So you can pick faster shipping but that does not mean Amazon will send it out.
