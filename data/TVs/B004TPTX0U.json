Second use is as a TV monitor for a guest that requires a larger screen than is  provided by a net book. In both instances the TA350 performed well.  The price that I purchased it was $249 at BJs.  In this price range there was nothing comparable.  I'm a Samsung fan so I found the set quite easy to put together right out of the box.  The auto channel was easy to use and selected all available channels transmitted from my cable provider.  It eliminated all premium scrambled channels not on my payment plan.  Connecting to an AV device or any external electronic device is easy.  The manual is very easy to follow, however if one knows a little about electronic home devices the set up is very intuitive and the manual almost not necessary. The set comes with all the cables necessary for use with a set cable top box, DVR input and stereo audio output. Did not find the strong criticism listed by reviewer Yellow 7080 on my set.  Perhaps he had either a unit problem or is more critical that I am.  I've used Viewsonic, Gateway, HP and Dell monitors in the past and present and find the T23A350 comparable in clarity, color and sharpness.

I use HDMI cable to connect it to an HD cable TV box in my home office about five feet away from my chair. I picked this one because the display had a warm glow that made it stand out from the other sets in this general size and price range at Costco. When I say \"warm glow,\" it's not a color temperature thing that I'm seeing; whites are still white, and color temperature can be adjusted. I believe the display's characteristic glow comes from the set's LED edge lighting. We have three other HDTV/monitors and this one's my favorite for viewing HD cable. The picture is highly customizable to personal taste. Edges and detail are sharp and natural when displaying HD. There's no lag or jitter with fast motion. The built-in stereo sound is acceptable. The included (non-universal) remote control is well laid out and easy to use.Rear inputs only on the display: two HDMI, one set of component video, analog audio, optical digital audio, Ex-link, mini headphone, coaxial cable, USB, PC In, PC/DVI Audio In. As with other 1080p sets, you are likely to find the picture quality disappointing unless you are using HDMI cable to connect to a source signal of at least 720p. DVDs and non-HD digital cable connected with component video cable look okay, but not great. I have not hooked the monitor up to my PC, so I can't comment on PC performance, but another Samsung 24\" widescreen monitor I have for PC has been terrific as well. The included stand attaches with screws that can be removed, or a wall mount can be used. You cannot tilt the stand up or down, but what more than compensates for that lack is that with the remote, you can set Samsung MagicAngle, the vertical viewing angle, to favor viewing the picture from above or below the display at different levels. The set is EnergyStar rated in Standard mode (where you can still fully adjust the picture). I highly recommend this as an extra TV for smaller rooms such as home office, kitchen, or bedroom.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Monitor!", "Author": "skimming the ether", "ReviewID": "R30RP5YFWHTTXW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't be misled by some claming that this is a poor monitor.

Cost in Manila was 13,500 pesos or $320 us.I used it for gaming and it is wonderful. Bright, Sharp and fast very happy with it. The TV tuner while in Manila on the hotel cable was so so but thought nothing of it.On returning home, found that the TV would need a firmware up grade to work best here in the states so I called Samsung to see how I could do that. They asked if I had the receipt which I did and then said they would send a US model out to my local UPS store and exchange mine for a US model! I told them it worked good just needed the software up grade but they said no problem they would exchange it. That was a breeze, waited 4 days, got a call from the UPS store and exchanged the monitor easy easy.Now the new one still has a great picture both for gaming and for text. I use it everyday with MS Visual Studio and Eclipe (Andriod dev software)never get tired of the display.I would suggest using the HDMI input. Don't waste money on a $50 cable, digital is digital it is perfect or it in nothing. $10 patch cable is all you need.If you must adjust the picture quality and I did, try doing so with your computers software and not the monitor itself. I found that gave me exactly what I needed for adjustments.Samsung you have a new customer for TV and monitors...Curly out", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Looks good but I expected better", "Author": "Mario", "ReviewID": "R2TO8DU28NVQO5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good looking TV set. Has many features to control how the image looks. As some have mentioned, the sound is a bit tinny, but that's understandable since this is a small TV. The image definition is nice and sharp. I mean it is a 1080p set. I was disappointed with the colors. They don't look as good as my old LCD set. I was expecting that my newer set would have better colors. The skin color on some people faces get easily overburned with red as it happens on old cheap first generation LCD screens. I was expecting better from an LED Samsung.

That is the label printed on the back of the monitor that Samsung Rep needed to know when I asked for assistance. It is a LED technology. I got it from CompUSA for $319.99 last January because I thought Amazon did not carry it. The physical screen size from corner to corner is 23 \u00bd inches and NOT 24 as I was invoiced for.From researched, there are 3 manufacturers of monitor/tv and Samsung is my trusted brand based on my experiences in my 2 existing laser printer & all in one scanner. I also trust the Hanspree monitor/tv because my more than 2 years old Hanspree HDMI 19 inches monitor is still in excellent working condition. Yet their monitor/tv design is not appealing as Samsung. The purpose is 90% monitor, 7% Netflix, and rest is TV.  This Samsung is connected to my desktop as well as to my laptop pc. One monitor for 2 pcs. HDMI is the connection to laptop and VGA cable is connected to desktop. My TV connection is Cox cable.The monitor's performance is very similar to other brands. What stands-out, is that 2 documents can fit at once due to its larger screen.  Even at 200% zoom size, the dot pixels in Word document have no viewing bad effect from a distance of 1 foot away. In fact the max allowed is 500% and still no dot pixels distortion. In short, it is an excellent monitor in both PCs. In Internet setting, I increased it to bigger text size (to make use of unused screen spaces) and still I do not have to keep flipping the page-up/down button compared to small size screen experiences.The Netflix/TV function is sub-par and I almost return it. I need to make use of my desktop mini-stereo for fidelity sounds of music, tv, & Netflix. T24A350 has tiny speakers and it does NOT support sound's output other than home theater and satellite devices. I went around with this shortcoming by buying a 3rd party Belkin stereo wire costing $7.00 from Amazon. It works and I do not have to plug/unplug the wire. I did not notice any sound volume reduction in Belkin wire too.The speed of 60 is slow and I usually noticed \"freezing scenes\" both in Netflix and TV moods. If you can, avoid the speed of 60. The PIP (picture-in-picture) will allow you to use Excell/Word (for example) and watch TV (in smaller screen in the corners) at the same time. I did not notice any lag using Excell/Word and TV at the same time. A significant system's slow down occurs when using Netflix in Samsung screen and Excell/Word in my laptop screen at the same time. Maybe my 2 years old laptop is slow. Viewing Netflix and TV scenes from a distance of 3 feet away, the pixels are very pronounced. It will not escape in anybody's un-trained eyes. The magic angle buzz word is just a sales talk. It means that this monitor can't be tilted and you need to remain seated. If you prefer standing or lie backward in your seat for 2 hours watching a movie, the colors and shapes were distorted and need to be compensated (magic-angled).During TV mode, its volume can't be controlled by any PC. The TV function is a stand-alone system. During Netflix, volume adjustment means nothing without the physical volume adjustment in the TV set itself.Should I recommend it? Of course yes for having both worlds.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung 23\" monitor/HDTV works great", "Author": "pc user", "ReviewID": "R23G80M7K2OFKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far it is working fine.

I bought this TV so I can have my own work and play station in my room. I hooked up my computer and console game system to it. Features and picture are really good. Sound wasn't that great, but I did not mind or really care for it. The issue with this TV is this: The TV keeps turning off and on constantly and rapidly. It did not do it in the beginning. About two months after I bought it, I noticed that I would be typing up something and then just turned off and back on again. And sometimes in the mornings when I wake up, it is on after I know I turned it off. Over the months it has gotten worse. I could not returned it because the issue started after the return period ended. And Samsung customer support and warranty wasn't a big help. I couldn't get an exchange or anything because they didn't understand the issue and assured there were no defects in their products. So basically $200+ went down the drain. I had to buy another TV because it is up to the point that does it every second if plugged in.

I had an antenna coax cable connect to it and it worked fine.  Six months in I needed to connect my DVD via the Composite/RCA (red/white/yellow) cable .  The Samsung TVs seem to have a split connector between the Component and Composite cables.  When connected I got a \"No Signal\" message.  I have tried connecting my cable box and vcr with different connectors but same issue.When I spoke with the Samsung rep they told me I will need to send it in and I mentioned that I didnt have the original packaging.  I was then told that they will provide the cost of packaging included in the shipping label.  When I went to ship this via UPS I was told that I will now have to pay $30 for the box/packaging.  When I called Samsung back all I got was a its not our problem and I have to shell out the money to send the device over.  All this after getting assurance the first time i called that the shipping would be covered.  Am very disappointed and will probably stick to buying a non brand name in the future so at least the expectations are not high and many times the service ends up being vastly superior.Takeaways:- dont throw away the boxes till you are past the warranty.- test all the ports when you buy your TV so you can be within the return period in case of any problems- the brand name companies take you for granted.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kitchen aid", "Author": "iPad 4 Grand Dad \"RPTR RSQ\"", "ReviewID": "R2IR7L6Q0A2Q55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This HDTV is exactly the right size for the wall cabinet in our kitchen.
