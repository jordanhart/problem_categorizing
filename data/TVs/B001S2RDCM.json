Word to the wise though, You will need HD service and an HD receiver in order to get the most out of this set in terms of HD programming. I really dig the cinema setting that darkens the picture (This is optional) to replicate a movie theater experience when watching a movie, it's a pretty cool feature.

Was surprised at how light it was, especially compared to the 25\" tube TV it was replacing. Anyway, got it out of the box, attached the stand, attached the cables and it was ready to go. Automatic setup took less than 5 minutes, and even found HD channels I didn't know I had (Explanation: I have Time Warner cable and this would just be plugged directly into the coax with no cable box. Previously I was only seeing about 70 SD channels, this TV found about 90 SD and about 10 HD channels, so I was pleasantly surprised.)The picture quality is great, sound is good, menu and operations are fairly straightforward and intuitive. Only reason I docked it one star is because the remote is only compatible with Sony products (Bravia specifically). I still need to keep my old remote to work the DVD player that will be used with this TV. Selfishness and greediness gets a one star deduction.One sticky point, the \"Favorites\" menu lists the raw channel number, and rearranges then depending on which one is currently being viewed.

It was very easy to set up.  Our cable package only has broadcast stations but with this we seem to be able to get the digital versions of a whole lot of basic cable channels.  Unfortunately, there's still nothing on them except reality shows and procedurals reruns, so it just confirmed for us the uselessness of cable TV.I hooked up my Mac Mini with a DVI to HDMI cable and got a Microsoft Wireless keyboard and mouse for it.  It works very well as a PC monitor and we are able to watch Netflix Watch Instantly movies, YouTube videos and TV shows from Hulu or the networks' sites.  We are using Boxee.tv as an interface and that works well.  Next up, get an eyeTV so we can use the thing as a DVR.This is working out exactly as I had hoped and I strongly recommend this TV.  We checked out the different brands at comparable price points ($400-$500) and only this one and the Samsung really floated our boat.  The picture is almost too clear.  I mean, how many acne scars do you really want to see?  It has a very usable favorites function which allows you to save your channels.  It also interfaces with our Sony Home Theater system with an HDMI cable so we can control the whole system with one remote.  Actually I can use the Home Theater remote and my wife can use the TV remote and we can have remote wars.It has a Picture in Picture function so you can watch TV while you're working on your PC.  One complaint is that in order to go back to full TV you have to go through more key presses than I would have liked.  The only other complaint is that it takes a few seconds to tune in each channel.We now have a very useable media center in our living room which gives us complete access to all the wonderful entertainment out there on the interwebs!", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture", "Author": "Michelle J.

(Sony would not guarantee that a new unit would be supplied, if a replacement was made.)I elected to return the unit to J&R;, who to their credit provided a prepaid UPS shipping label. As it would take approximately 2 weeks before J&R; received the defective unit, give me credit for the return, and reshipped a replacement, I elected to purchase another unit so immediate shipment could be made, with my account to be credited upon receipt of the original defective return.About a week later, the second Sony TV arrived. Upon opening the shipping box and setting up the TV, it was found that the LCD screen was \"cracked\" internally (not visable until power was applied) and that it was inoperable. Another call was made to J&R;, and this second Sony has now been repacked and we are awaiting pickup by UPS for return to J&R; for yet another credit.I wish to quickly state that everyone I have talked to at J&R; Electronics have been extremely helpful, and I would not hesitate to do business with them in the future. They are very professional, friendly and caring.On the other hand, Sony Support (they mainly use off-shore outsourcing personnel) is absolutely horrible and these \"support\" people have absolutely no technical knowledge to assist the caller. (Half the time one also gets disconnected and has to call back and start at the beginning of the waiting line again.)Call it bad luck, however EVERY single Sony product I have purchased over the last 6-8 years have had \"out-of-box\" problems, requiring either exchange or repair. A few years ago, my very expensive Sony \"book-shelf\" AM-FM-SW Radio-CD combo developed problems. It spent over 6 months in Sony's Company Owned Burbank Service Center. They could not repair it and finally had to send it to Sony's Engineering Labs in Arizona to be repaired, which took another 2 months to complete. To this day the system still does not work properly, with one audio channel constantly turning itself on and off, at will. I have many other Sony QC problems I could cite, but won't bore you with the details.It is no wonder that, today, Sony are having financial problems. Their product QC is very poor and their support even worse.-UPDATE (23-Oct-09)-Yesterday, while visiting a local Best Buy store, I noticed ALL of the Sony LCD HDTV's were being deeply discounted. The KDL32L500 (above) was on sale for $429.00. They had a ton of them in stock, but apparently no takers. The 1080p version (KDL32S5100) was being offered at $544.00.

I bought a universal remote and found it didn't work either. I therefore assumed that the IR sensor was faulty. I called Sony tech support to discuss the problem and the technician told me based on my model# that there was a software update indicated to correct the problem I described. I was thrilled, thinking I wouldn't have to shell out the cash for the IR sensor replacement, which through Sony costs more than half the price of a new tv. I'm currently running firmware version 8 but the newest version is 14. The technician walked me through downloading the software update only to find that although there is an update for this model TV, it doesn't apply to my serial#. You can't even download the file unless you enter an applicable serial#. I would love to know why some serial numbers can be upgraded and others can't. The technician told me I'd have to replace the IR sensor afterall but I'm not convinced that would even correct the problem. And if it did, how do I know it won't just start again in 2 months.

(It used to stand for Quality, alas, not anymore.)My 1st two months I would shrug off the following: It would work beautifully for a few days then, out of the blue, I couldn't turn it back ON again. Neither remote control nor OFF/ON switch would work. I tried disconnecting the power chord from the wall outlet and replugged it back in after some 20 seconds. (Like rebooting a misbehavin' computer, it would work.) Then intermitently after a few minutes, I could not turn it back ON without unplugging and replugging or it would work OK for a few days and then start again.Finally, sick and tired of being my own remote control (for exercise, I go to the gym; I don't to walk to and from the TV set so often) I took to the Local Service Centre where after my whole explanation as above, the young lady wrote down, \"TV doesn't work.\" I stopped and told her to PLEASE put down the symptoms as I had carefully explained. She put down \"Intermitently --actually she wrote down intermittenly but I knew she meant intermitently-- will not Turn ON.That was on a Sat. 08AUG.

I bought it because the store model seemed to have the most natural color, compared to the Sharp and Toshiba 32-inchers. But the out-of-the-box settings were TERRIBLE: white peoples' faces were so red they all looked drunk or in a rage. For the first week I fiddled with the color controls - without getting the kind of natural skin color I was hoping for. Then I discovered the \"advanced\" controls, where you can individually adjust the red, blue, and green levels. Now I have about 9 things to adjust and I STILL can't get it right - AUGGGH! I've been considering returning it, but the other options either don't have the connections I need (I'm using an S-video connection) or have iffy reliability ratings. I've gotten the picture to where it's pretty decent most of the time, so I'll probably keep it, but I don't recommend it.I'm feeding the sound through my stereo, so I can't say anything about the speakers on this TV.Another issue is with programs broadcast in 4:3 ratio - you sometimes see a silver shimmery effect at the edges of things. 16:9 broadcasts are very sharp. (I'm using rabbit ears to get broadcast digital channels. If you haven't done it already, I suggest you cancel your cable TV and get some rabbit ears and start watching incredibly clear TV for free!)The set has several \"wide mode\" settings for viewing sources that don't naturally fill the screen. 16:9 programs naturally fill the screen. FOr viewing old-style 4:3 shows, you can choose \"normal\" mode, which fits the picture in top-to-bottom, leaving black bands on the sides, \"zoom\", which fills the screen side-to-side, so that you don't see the top and bottom of the picture, \"full\", which stretches the picture side-to-side to fill the screen, while keeping everything in-screen, or \"wide zoom\" which is some sort of compromise between stretching and leaving stuff out. Personally, I can't stand a picture that has been stretched in any way, so I never use \"full\" (except for 16:9 sources) or \"wide zoom\". BUt the other two modes take care of most everything I watch. For some reason, when watching a DVD I sometimes see black bars at the top and bottom even when I'm on \"zoom\" - but this isn't a big deal.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "My advice - don't buy a Sony", "Author": "C.

I purchased this television in July 2009 from Best Buy and was generally well pleased with the television.  It was perfect for my bedroom and suited my needs (affordable, size, and reliable).However, reliability has gone out the window!!  My tv for some reason failed in January 2010.  It would no longer power on.  There was no power damage as I had the tv plugged into a Monster surge protector and my two other items that I have plugged into this protector have had no problems.I spoke with the Sony rep. when it first died and she had me try plugging it into different outlets (I had already done this, but humored her.)  I was shocked that her magic voice did not fix the item.  She was willing to send me a refurbished tv and take mine back so I agreed to that.Well, two weeks later and the refurbished tv is now failing.  It will turn on and then inexplicably power off moments later.  I have tried it in multiple outlets and it does not matter which outlet I plug it into.I am now on hold (still) with Sony hoping to get a refund rather than a third television that will fail.

Just ridiculous. Sony has sunk to an all time low in my book. There products are just overpriced junk. I strongly suggest nobody buys this terrible product! It is a total waste of time and money.

Comparing all of the specifications, brands and sale prices every weekend can be daunting.  Two rules: Never pay full price and always choose quality over quantity(size in this case.)I purchased this TV during the holidays as a gift for myself.  There have been a few \"deals\" below $300 on 32\" sets from different companies.  I knew those would be inferior products and I was torn between this and its brother 504 model. I ultimately determined that the 504 was a special holiday version made probably made with a few cheaper components for a better profit margin and ordered this online from WallyWorld for 449, during the long site to store wait the price dropped to 399.  I was credited the difference very easily with a phone call, and received the same rebate last week.  The reason for ordering online was due to a 20% off promo (see rule #1.)ONE ISSUE.  The set I received has a little damage to the box.  It didn't do anything cosmetically to the set, but there was an issue with the picture.  In a couple of areas, there was a slightly lighter dark gray area when is should be black.  When I noticed this at home, I was pretty perturbed.  Especially after waiting 10 days.  To determine whither to return or exchange, I scoured the internet for a term and prevalence and for it was called clouding, but was only in reference to much older LED TVs.  I believe it was due to the handling, not build quality.  My replacement set is perfect!If you are a tech person and want a big bang for your pick this is the way to go.  There are many features that are not very common in 32\" 720p sets such as: nice display adjustment (including backlight) treble, bass and balance audio adjustment and Picture in Picture(only when using PC and TV:There are NOT two tuners!)

Plasma wasn't an option in this size.  I picked a 720p model based on every opinion I read that said 1080p didn't matter for broadcast TV or DVDs in a TV this size, and being able to see the pizels when I'm a foot away doesn't matter, I agree.  I also cost just over $500 -- what I wanted to pay.That said, I am completely mystified why the whole world seems to be moving to LCD TVs.  All scenes, even in the most dialed-down modes of brightness, contrast and backlight, have intense highlights -- as if they're in bright studio lighting with no fill.  The color out of the box is nothing like on a regular tube TV -- interesting, and watchable, but not anything close to realistic.  I plan to buy one of those home theater \"tune your color at home\" DVDs but I doubt it's going to help much.  Color and contrast also vary a lot off-angle.  I'm used to this from staring at LCD monitors at work for years, but it's disappointing in a TV.I was also very disappointed that the audio out on this TV is not affected by the volume control, but a fixed level. This has been going on for years in other TVs -- I bought my 27\" tube set, a JVC, because it has this feature over a Panasonic that I returned because it didn't, but it means that you need yet another remote or a new receiver and a custom remote to control it if you don't use the built-in speakers, which actually sound okay for in-TV speakers, but nothing like the stereo pair with external amp I've been using.  BTW, current Panasonic's don't even HAVE an audio out -- you need an HDMI capable receiver to put between your video source and the TV to have audio through a decent receiver and speakers.So, I moved the old TV back where it was, and put this in family room, where we had a pretty small TV, and it's fine there and an improvement, and I can simply use the internal speakers, but if and when I decide to spring for a really decent theater size TV, (which requires new furniture and a lot more money) I'll buy a 50\" or 54\" plasma -- no more LCDs for me for serious watching.", "Date": "July 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Rayne Rivers", "ReviewID": "RKU8RCJ2SSEEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the tv was shipped timely and in great condition. very satisfied the  product itself.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not up to Sony's reputation", "Author": "J.

The picture tube on the TV went after only owning this for five months.  This thing is complete junk and now Target will not stand behind it.
