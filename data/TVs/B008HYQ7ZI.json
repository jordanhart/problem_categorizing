{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "NYC Ron", "ReviewID": "RGU569PX6O7S8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my dearly beloved Bravia KDL-32S3000 succumbed to a power surge I sadly went looking for a replacement. The highly rated Samsung UN32EH5000 that I bought soon went back to the store. I might have gotten used to what I consider to be an overly narrow frame around the screen, but I was unable to tone down the garish colors and the tinny sound would have necessitated buying additional speakers. It also didn't correctly automatically size the input from my computer. To toggle back and forth between the computer and TV would have required constant readjustment of the screen setting.The Bravia KDL-32BX330 which I bought to replace it had a decent picture and I liked its wide frame. It correctly recognized my computer input. On the other hand, it too had a tinny sound.When I also bought the somewhat more expensive Bravia KDL-32EX340 to compare with the BX330 I was really impressed. The EX340 allows you to control the intensity of the backlight--something the BX330 does not. Comparing the images of the two Bravias using the same input, I found that the EX340 produced a more subtle shading of colors on people's faces. The BX330 oversaturated the color on people's faces; when I turned down the intensity of the color of the background looked washed out.Not only that, but the quality of the EX340's sound was actually good with the bass booster turned on! The speakers are under the TV, facing down and slightly forward rather than in the back. (That said, with all of these TVs I had to turn the volume up to almost the maximum.)I'm not a great fan of the glossy black finish that most TVs seem to have nowadays. And in dark scenes the semigloss screens reflect back light from the room. That said, I can highly recommend the Bravia KDL-32EX340.Just a note: as others have noted on various TV reviews, you want to turn off the power saving and light detection features which dim the TV. If you have the option keep the \"store\" setting which boosts the light from the screen: otherwise, you'll want to jack up the backlight to the max.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "SONY THE ONE AND ONLY - WORTH THE EXTRA $$$", "Author": "B boy", "ReviewID": "R3K2AZOP3C1343", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv on AMAZON a week ago and am very satisfied with it.  The picture, though only 720p, is incredibly sharp.  But what sold me on the SONY TV is the incredible range of colors that it can display. I compared it to  a comparable Samsung 32\" LED TV and found the SONY offered a brighter picture with a wider range of color rendition.  Remember the old SONY Trinitron  TV sets?  I still have one that works from 1981 and even back then the SONY set displayed a wider range of colors.  The SONY had a beautiful picture right out of the box and for me it required no further tuning of the settings.  However there are many options for the customization of picture and sound settings.  The sound on this unit is surprisingly good, though if this is your main tv you might prefer a soundbar or external speakers.  The quality of construction of the TV and of the remote control is excellent.  I also observed very clear motion during sporting events with no blurring or pixalation.  The SONY is worth the extra money and I cannot find anything not to like about it.  It is a very user-friendly set with a gorgeous picture.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is an old version of Sony 32 inch TV", "Author": "Lax", "ReviewID": "R17KPQCDO1NOHP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this tv couple of weeks back.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but everyone has this set listed as 720p and both of mine are 1080i.  Maybe Sony changed this spec but I checked in the manual and it says the same.  The price on Amazon went up $100 right after I bought mine.  Maybe they discovered this fact also????Both of my TV's are great and have a great picture.  No white lines on mine like others have commented about.One minor gripe I do have is that neither Sony TV I bought had screws for a wall mount.  The wall mount kit I bought didn't even have the right size screws, and because of the speakers at the bottom making the cabinet wider, I had to modify the wall mount to fit the length of screws I was able to find.  Come on Sony whats a few screws!!!  My Samsung and LG TV's all had them???  Go figureAlso when is the TV industry going to bring out higher resolutions for us PC owners.  The resolution of 1080i is OK for a 27\" computer monitor but for a 32\" makes the text blurry.  I ended up backing mine down to 1360X768.  If the industry wants to advertise flat panels for PC use then they need to address this and the power standby issues.

I bought my first Sony in the early 80's (used @ that!) and it lasted for 26 years!  I got off track when HDTV came out and bought a Hannspree impulsively from QVC and I also have a Visio and I've never been satisfied with either one.  This time I got it right.  What I really love, in addition to the obvious Sony attributes mentioned in reviews by others, are the viewing angles.  My other HDTV's have lousy viewing angles.  You almost need to be sitting directly in front of the TV to view a good picture.  This Sony is great from all angles, right & left and also from below (I have it sitting up on the top of an armoire as the armoire functions as my office).  Yes, the cord's a bit chintzy, but this is close to perfection!  Also arrived very quickly.  Very, very pleased with my Sony purchase from Amazon!", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "SECOND REVISION & UPDATE: calibrated settings (non-official)", "Author": "John Smith", "ReviewID": "R35VS0GQ31JAJD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(EDIT, May 19, 2014: I forgot to mention that this TV is capable of receiving 24p output. I had known about this function on my Blu-ray player, but never bothered to try it until now. Bottom line: does it make a difference? That depends on the source material. Over all, I would call the effect noticeable, but not dramatic. There was slight improvement on some DVDs and Blu-rays; on others, nothing. Maybe on a bigger screen, the effect of 1080/24p would be more pronounced.)(EDIT, Nov. 19: I've left the initial text as is.  Revised settings appear at the end).  Full disclosure: I did not purchase this through Amazon.  I bought the Sony KDL-32EX340 because my old Vizio died on me.  The base of the TV is separate, and you'll have to attach it yourself; they include the three screws, but you'll need a Phillips head screwdriver.  At first, I was annoyed, but when I had to move, this feature came in handy (luckily, I had kept the original box).  This TV is also significantly less bulky, probably due to it being edge lit (as opposed to back lit), which was also a definite plus.  The speakers were well designed; instead of being located on the back, as with my old TV, on this one they're located on the bottom, facing slightly forward.  This is a 720p TV, but that's fine; according to Cnet, TVs of this screen size can't take advantage of a full 1080p image anyway.And now, the calibrated picture settings.  Full credit: 99.9% of the following info comes from the folks at cnet.com, whose info on TVs and electronics in general I've found valuable over the years.  Cnet has not, unfortunately, reviewed this TV (as of this writing).  So what I did was search for TVs that were similar; I chose the KDL-32BX420, and the KDL-32R400A.  I decided to use these as base models because they were made by the same company (Sony), they had same screen size (32 inches), and they came out within a year of this one (the former in 2011, the latter in 2013).  After testing, to my eyes the settings for the KDL-32R400A looked best.  They are as follows:Picture Mode: CustomBackilght: 3Picture: 92Brightness: 50Color: 50Hue: R1Sharpness: MinColor Temperature: Warm 2 (Note: the original review says \"Warm;\" this model has \"Warm 1\" and \"Warm 2.\"  I chose this setting because in one of their tutorials, Cnet recommends setting color temp at max).Noise Reduction: OffMPEG Noise Reduction: OffCinemotion: OffAdvanced Settings: turn all these off (or leave at zero, as appropriate)Eco Menu: turn the \"Power Saving\" and \"Light Sensor\" functions off, because they'll dim the picture.My Blu-ray player is a Panasonic DMP-BD60, with all firmware upgrades.  Viewing distance was about 7 feet, and I tried these settings in both well lit and dark rooms.  I used three discs as test material: an average transfer (The Lion in Winter dvd), an excellent transfer (Conspiracy dvd), and an excellent Blu-ray (Cleopatra).  I also tried various combinations from the picture settings of both models (especially Gamma and White Balance), but none were satisfactory.  The \"Reset\" function was very handy, as it allowed me to instantly return to factory settings.  To my eyes, while the settings for the Sony KDL-32R4004 are not \"official\" for the 32EX340, they were superior to the factory settings.  Like many people, at first I was disappointed; I was used the bold, garish, overly sharp images one sees on an uncalibrated TV.  Then I took a closer look.  Many defects that I thought were inherent in the source material were minimized, or eliminated altogether.  This was particularly true with grain.  Fine detail, such as color patterns of drapes in the backround, or stitching in clothing, became much more apparent.  Flesh tones were more natural, and bright colors (such as red) retained their impact without being too \"loud.\"As far as sound is concerned, I also tested it with the three discs mentioned above.  The bottom line: to my ears, the \"Standard\" mode, with the Bass Booster on and everything else set to off (or zero), was best overall.  On the average transfer, the other sound settings magnified audio hiss to the point that it became distracting.  For the other discs, the other audio settings sounded too tinny (Clear Voice), or too overwhelming (Dynamic).  With Standard, you get the full effect of the audio recording, while still retaining discernible dialogue.This TV does, unfortunately, have a reflective screen.  Cnet recommends viewing in a dark room, as reflected light will interfere with image fidelity, and all their calibrations are made for this sort of environment.  They say it's best to place a very dim light behind your television, to help avoid eye strain.  Me, I just used an ordinary, low wattage night light that I bought for $5, then centered my TV stand in front of it, and turned off all other lighting in the room.  I didn't think the effect would do much of anything, but I was wrong; I was impressed with how much better it was.  Funny how small details like that can make movie watching more enjoyable.I was happy with this TV.  While it probably won't satisfy hardcore videophiles, I think that it's a good choice for people like myself: those who want a quality TV, and don't want to break their bank account to get one.  I recommend it.EDIT: REVISED SETTINGS, Nov. 19:After doing a little more research on cnet, I found this on their \"Picture settings and calibration FAQ:\"\"Are picture settings for one model going to look good on a different screen size or model by the same manufacturer?  Usually they're a good start.  If we haven't reviewed your exact model but we have reviewed a similar one - especially a model from the same year or even the same series in a different screen size - go ahead and try our settings.  They usually translate well.\"Using this as a guideline, I found the Sony KDL-46EX640, which was released the same year, and with three minor exceptions has all the same menu options.  Testing was done as above, and sound settings remain the same.  In my opinion, these picture settings are even better than the ones I listed previously.  They are as follows:Picture Mode: CustomBacklight: 9Picture: 97Brightness: 51Color: 50Hue: 0Sharpness: MinColor Temperature: Warm 2Noise Reduction: OffMotionflow: Off (Note: the 32EX340 does not have a \"Motionflow\" listing.  I included it for the sake of completeness.)Cinemotion: Auto (Note: original review has \"Auto 1;\" this model only has \"Auto\")Advanced Settings Menu: Leave everything at \"Off,\" or \"0\" as appropriate, except for White Balance MenuWhite Balance Submenu:R-Gain: -5G-Gain: 0B-Gain: -5R-Bias: -2G-Bias: +2B-Bias: +3Screen Menu:Wide Mode: FullAuto Wide: Off4:3 Default: Off (grayed out)Auto Display Area: OffDisplay Area: Normal (Note: original review has \"Full Pixel;\" this model does not have that function)Horizontal Center: 0 (grayed out)Vertical Center: 0 (grayed out)Scene Select Menu: GeneralEco Menu: Make sure that \"Power Saving\" is set to \"Off.\"  Leave everything else as is.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal!", "Author": "JM", "ReviewID": "R3R1F9J3BIK2QJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome picture, great sound.

Today we had Comcast run a cable for it and hook it up to a HD Box in a small bedroom. The picture is great and the sound is very good, although, I might buy some external speakers for it. Most flat screen TVs need better speakers added on. Anyway, we have Digital and HD stations and the tech told us the TV shows that it's 1080i which is strange because it was listed in the store and on Amazon as 720P. I bought the TV thinking it was 720P because under 40\" one can't really tell the difference between 720P and 1080i or 1080P so why pay more? The box it came in doesn't indicate anything regarding its resolution like 720P or 1080i. It's a LCD but has a LED back light or \"edge.\" It also has the \"Clear Resolution Enhancer\" and in the store it was set up on demo mode and the difference between the Clear Resolution Enhancer and normal mode was very noticeable, but maybe this is just part of their advertising approach and all better made HD TVs could have similar technology. The choice, for me, was between Sony and a Samsung. The two were sitting next to one another and the Sony had a better picture. We have a Sony 60\" LCD/LED 1080P and we have two Sony Play Station 3 we use as Blue-Ray DVDs. I do like Sony but was prepared to buy a Samsung due to the reviews, plus, my step-son has three 32\" Samsung's behind his bar and they all have very nice clear pictures! However, side-by-side, in the Best Buy store, the Sony had a slightly better picture than the 32\" 720P Samsung. It seems, regardless of specs, the picture quality is of primary concern. I was fortunate that they had these two brands setting side-by-side. I'm assuming they were both in default mode and one wasn't tuned-in better that the other.

Buffington", "ReviewID": "R32VZMDB5IN1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like Sony TVs and my family has largely standardized on Sonys.  I wanted this KDL-32EX340 for use in my garage workshop while I am working.  Thus I wanted a 32 inch or so sized screen, did not want to compromise on color or picture, and wanted a TV that had decent out-of-the-box sound.  This TV was, after all, for the garage and I do not want to set up a home theater setup there.  This little unit significantly exceeded my expectations.  Firstly, the picture on this TV is far, far better than my larger Sharp Aquos TV we have in our bedroom.  The Sony algorithms translate a 720p picture into a very sharp, vivid, lifelike picture.  In my shop I use this TV in conjunction with my Apple TV, which mainly provides 720p input anyway, and the images have no pixelization, and the motion flow technology renders movement mostly pretty realistic, although not as startlingly so as our 55 inch Sony in the living room.  Setup is a breeze, and the menus are easy to use.  I find that setting this TV on \"Cinema\" yields the best picture, but there are numerous other choices to fiddle with, so this TV should be able to satisfy most any user.The sound on this set is about as good as it gets without using external speakers, which is to say good but not great.  There is plenty of volume for my little garage workshop, at any rate.For its price class I really do not think that you can do better at this time than the KDL-32EX340.  Highly recommended.

Yes, it's well known Sony always charges a premium on their products for the name, but in today's highly competitive TV market, Sony needs to wake up and improve their product offerings or it will continue to lose footing to the competition. I'm not anti-Sony, in fact I don't carry any preference to any brand. I buy based on the best quality-to-price ratio. In this case, I chose to buy this TV during recent sales to replace an older 32\" LCD that still works fine (but is probably near the end of its service life) because I wanted the PIP feature. However, the 32EX340 has several flaws that just don't live up to previous Sony offerings.Pros:- lightweight, slim design- bright picture, realistic deep blacks- 1080p achievable (only through HDMI input)- great sound for rear facing speakers from a 32\" TVCons:- minimal input options considering the price- non-waterfall inputs panel- special (ie. from Sony) wall mount needed- SD analog channels appear blurred- laggy, pixelated HD video through component input- quick access menus are cluttered with useless options- PIP feature is very misleading and not explained in any promotional material (see below)I think the pros speak for themselves. Let me explain my justification for the cons. First, there should be at least 1 more HDMI and 1 more component input considering the regular retail price. I've seen other 32\" LCDs a third less than this TV with more inputs. Yes, I'm aware the current trend is for manufacturers to include less inputs to save costs, but following the adage of you pay for what you get, you'd expect at least 1 extra HDMI port. My old 32\" LCD TV from 5 years ago has more connection options and it cost much less than I paid for this TV. Second, the Sony engineers made a jerk move and purposely designed the inputs panel to come out of the back close to the wall bracket mounting area, meaning any inputs would interfere with a wall mount. I searched for a few more reviews and found that others have reported a special wall mount available only from Sony is needed for this model, which doesn't surprise me based on where they decided to put the inputs panel. However, the included base is well designed and very sturdy - not worried about it ever tipping over.Third, the quality of SD video is very poor, looking blurred at edges even after trying to optimize the picture settings. Maybe I just got a dud. But it's worse than even the cheaper brand name 32\" LCD TV I bought 5 years ago. Any rational consumer would assume improvements in technology would mean better or equal quality to previous years, not worse. Or Maybe Sony just used cheaper materials and tech to save money. Fourth, the HD video through the component input is often laggy and pixelated. The lag is noticeable and recurs often enough that I've actually been able to time that the video can lag between 0.5-1.5 seconds. It usually occurs consecutively which makes it even more noticeable (ie. 3-5 lag \"periods\" in a row). I know it's not my HD digital box or the cables because I used the exact same configuration with my older 32\" LCD that I replaced with this one, and I never once experienced such lag or pixelation with the older one. It's highly annoying and should never occur at this price point.Fifth, the quick access menus are cluttered with useless options. You would assume the settings menu should be easily accessible but it isn't. There's no dedicated button for it on the remote like most other TV brands, and is only accessible through one quick access menu that has it buried below useless links to photo slideshow, music player, and video player (from USB) options. In fact, the photo slideshow options takes up 2 different slots (why is this necessary?) and is at the very top of this quick access menu. Very few people have use for displaying photo slideshows on a TV these days that would warrant it being the first option on the menu, and no one uses a TV just as a music player (especially when it will only read the mp3 format). The video player is only limited to the mpeg format and thus also completely useless, considering that anyone who would actually want to play custom videos on the TV would already have a HTPC setup or connect their PC via the HDMI or VGA inputs. And on a somewhat related note, you can only add channels to the favourites menu, but cannot delete channels - another seemingly minor but head-scratching decision by Sony.Lastly, the PIP feature is highly disappointing and worse than Sony's 32\" LCD TV offering from last year. I was never expecting true analog PIP since this is a 1 tuner TV, but I was expecting it to at least be as good as last year's model. For example, last year's model allowed PIP for any of the inputs with the analog input, such as: analog/component, analog/HDMI, HDMI/analog, etc. And the analog input could be put on the main window. For whatever reason, Sony really shortchanged it in this year's model. The PIP only allows PC (either VGA or HDMI) and any other input, meaning the PC input takes the main screen and other inputs can only take the sub window. More expensive than last years model with less features? And of course, Sony provides no elaboration of the specific PIP functions anywhere in the tech specs on its site or in any promo material.So I definitely would not recommend this TV to anyone. If you want a 32\" LCD TV with premium features, look elsewhere because Sony has inexplicably chosen to cut out such features that justify a premium price. At best, this model only offers minor additions over cheaper 32\" TVs which can achieve almost the same picture quality, so it obviously makes more sense to go with a better priced TV (I won't mention them by name, but anyone should know there are plenty of good quality ones to choose from). Additionally, it used to be that you could count on a brand like Sony for reliable quality control, but based on other reports of this model, it seems Sony is dropping the ball on this front too. Don't get me wrong, I have no qualms with paying more for higher quality, more reliable products no matter who the manufacturer is - but ONLY if the products follows through and justifies the price. The KDL32EX340 does not.And to Sony: it's confusing that you continue to think your brand name carries the same weight it used to. The majority of consumers are more informed these days, both returning and new, and you shouldn't expect to continue making sales on the coattails of your brand name and the use of fancy marketing lingo for standard features.

Fischer", "ReviewID": "R3GR0SGL1SQYD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this initially from Amazon, had some real issues with the performance of the TV (color, dark screen) and ended up returning it.  Amazon is so great to deal with when you have a reasonable reason for a return!  I talked with their tech line and after much discussion, we jointly decided there were issues we were having that was not 'right' for a new out of box TV!  Please note, we have a Sony Bravia XBR for our home theater which always has had an exquisite picture, which is one reason we got this one AFTER having looked and played with one at our local 'big box' store.Could not get the green adjusted AT ALL with the HUE control.  Then in a moderately lit room, whenever the scene was somewhat dark, the screen would suddenly 'fade' to VERY dark, then come back up, then fade again, in inconsistent, variable pulses or surges.  Really weird, couldn't make any adjustments, even in the Advanced controls, that would correct this.  Did not seem to matter what signal (cable or DVD), but comparing to a small Sansui CRT TV and a 24\" NAXA brand LED LCD, they both had consistently good pictures while the Sony was really bad.Fast forward, after ordering and returning a Panasonic for yet other performance issues, I again looked at this Sony at our local 'box store' and, with their price an Amazon match and the TV showing a wonderful picture (again), I brought one home.  We have been very pleased, no 'dark scene surging' and really good color, that seems to be improving the more we watch it.  The blacks are not as 'black' as some folks seem to expect or like, and the picture is not our XBR, but this one is for our living room and casual TV broadcast viewing.  The picture and color are VERY dependent upon a good digital signal.  We get FANTASTIC clean and sharp pictures when we plug in the computer with HDMI and stream from networks to catchup on shows and from our (non-digital) cable when the source is an HD broadcast, we get a great picture with good color.  Viewing angle is better on Panasonics, but the picture on this Sony is superior in color and detail and for smoothness of motion.  Analog TV is so-so, but even comparing that to the same broadcast on the XBR shows that the old analog signal just looks best on a CRT screen!  more forgiving technology.Summing, we are happy with the Sony ... just be prepared (per drivers of the delivery agents) for possible issues with an LCD delivered in the small, slim store box they drop ship it in!  LCDs are not designed to take a lot of abuse, so boxes that are not well padded that receive a lot of bumps on their way to the door may have issues to be dealt with!  That said, I've received 2 of the NAXA brand TVs via UPS that were just fine ... but in larger and more padded boxes.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony TV", "Author": "Dr. Donald R.

But, and it's a BIG but, the color from the Trinitron is more natural. In fact, that is the case with virtual every flat panel TV I've seen. It's a matter of personal preference.

After all, it's cheap and I expect new tech to come along at the same price sooner than later, giving me an easy excuse to upgrade.  Nonetheless, it's likely the TV will be in full view of anyone who comes into my house or maybe I simply want the thing to not subtract from everything around it.Sony's known for some extremely attractive products which have often been backed up by quality technology.  In this case, the package is cheap and the video performance is fairly nondescript as well.  I felt the picture was rather harsh relative to its competitors and the blacks weren't nearly as black as I've come to expect.  I compare this set to the 40\" Sony NX I've owned for a couple years and of course it comes up short, but perhaps too short even for the price.  3 stars for an average overall product.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great model, great price, great performance", "Author": "Lewis H.

After comparing price and performance details on three LEDs, a Samsung, LG, and  Sony at Best Buy, the choice clearly was the Sony. Amazon reviews on the Samsung were disturbing to say the least as they expressed concerns about Samsung's practice of installing variable quality (low, medium, high) screens from four different suppliers and marketing the products all as the same model, same price--a game of \"poor quality\" roulette foisted upon the unsuspected buyer.. Scratch Samsung. LG was quite acceptable at 720 pixels, but Sony was the final choice, particularly after one Amazon/Sony reviewer pointed out that the Sony that Amazon was marketing at 720 p was actually 1080p, at least according to the Sony manual.  Whatever the real case, I selected Amazon as the vendor. Their price was $100 less than Best Buy and Amazon delivered the TV directly to my apt--no lugging a big oversize box out to Best Buys parking lot, stuffing it into my van, and the hauling it up 14 floors to my apt.

When you open the box, and take out the Operating Instructions Manual, the first thing you see on the front cover is \"Sony LCD TV\".  This is an LCD TV.  Don't let the product description lead you to think otherwise...the description states \"LED HD TV\" at least a half a dozen time...always in ALL CAPS.  It really grabs your attention.  I called Amazon Customer Service on this, they agreed that the description indicated 'LED HD TV\", but still, they passed the buck to Sony.  I called Sony and spoke with a gentleman I could barely understand, who wanted me to believe that an LCD screen is exactly the same as an LED screen.  I don't quite buy it, but, then again, I'm not a consumer electronics expert...I'm just a doctor with post-graduate degrees, so my capacity to understand things like display screens and product descriptions is vastly limited.  Even so, I still do not believe Sony when they told me there is no difference between LED and LCD technology.  They went on further to say that all LED displays are really LCD displays.  Maybe, but the bottom line is: this product in NOT an LED HD TV, even though the product description tells you it is.  My 7-year old Samsung LCD tvs have a better picture than this alleged LED HD TV.  The picture is dark, not nearly as vibrant as either of my 7-year old LCD screens, despite having spent considerable time plowing through the myriad adjustments and settings available in the Setting Menu.

The color management menu offered a lot of control-And that's a good thing.  Once adjusted, the picture was very good so long as you did not move your head. Moving your head slightly to left or right caused a noticeable contrast and color shift, albeit not a large shift, but there nonetheless.  I did notice that with the input of average programming or a DVD input that was less than ideal, did caused the TV to look really bad.  This TV needs a pristine input i.e. HD blu-ray or off-air HD broadcast to look good, whereas in the old days an average good CRT TV would give you a good picture even with a fairly good input, and of course would get progressively better as the signal quality improved-There was and still is something special about the color pallet a good CRT can produce.  With regard to the SONY KDL32EX340 TV, it has very poor off axis viewing, so don't try to watch this TV when being off on an angle or standing up, it is certainly no where close to the off-axis viewing capability of the old CRT TV or that of today's CRT and digital projection projectors.  I can certainly attest to that because I have a Sanyo Z5 and a Optoma HD66 projector/100\" screen set up and a got it for a fraction of the cost of a 70\"-90\" of a LED TV.  My next projector, a Mitsubishi HC-4000, will give an even better picture-and I'm just talking about a \"low cost\" projector that can run circles around the average high cost  LED/Plasma TV in terms of sheer picture quality.  This SONY TV was taken back to the store for a refund because of its poor off-axis picture quality, and its poor motion handling.  And speaking of motion error, an aspect missed by many, is usually seen with scenes with fine detail and then that detail is lost if the subject moves and then returns when the subject becomes stationary again i.e. someone wearing a corduroy jacket that is clearly seen but the stripes in that jacket disappears when the subject moves and the stripes reappears when the subject becomes stationary again.  The same is true for faces, if the subject moves, the face takes on a porcelain look and the back to fine detail again when the subject comes to rest-a property that does not happen with a good CRT TV or certainly not with projectors.  I have faith in the new OLED TVs that is underway.  They do promise a better picture, and so there's always hope.  I would not recommend this TV.
