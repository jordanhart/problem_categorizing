{"Reviews": [{"Title": "only if size matters", "Author": "reycer", "ReviewID": "R1HO8L9X58F8TR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I originally bought the Samsung 60 inch model 7050 from Costco and I was very impressed with the picture and overall quality; I did have issues with the Samsung; like I could not get the Audio Return Channel to work.  Since I bought the Samsung we remodeled our theater room and the new arrangement allowed for a bigger display.  I have been eyeing the 70 inch sharp I was hesitant to get the larger Sharp because I did not feel I would keep the beautiful picture the Samsung offered right out of the box. When I exercised the incredible Costco return policy I came home with the Sharp Aquos LC-70C8470U and wall mounted this beast on to a brilliant articulating wall mount. To say the least, the entire family was impressed with the size of this thing.  It was not that hard to see that the picture was not the quality of the Samsung. The picture looked a bit soft and the color uniformity seemed less than inspiring.  Knowing that I had 90 days to test out this new monster I did not waste any time calibrating the set with my copy of the Digital Video Essentials (DVE) HD Basic Blu-Ray disc.  I spent a night and the next morning trying to dial this TV in to give it a fair chance of surviving in my home.  The following are the values I came up with after calibrating with the DVE Blu-ray disc.  I use a PS3 Slim for my Blu-ray player and the video signal goes through my Onkyo 709 receiver. I am not sure if all Sharp displays come from the factory with the same video quality, but if they do, people who buy this TV should try the settings I found to work pretty good. In the end, the picture quality improved.  The softness and color was brought back closer to what the Samsung was.  I still think the Samsung offered an overall better picture but for now I am close with the Sharp 70 inch and the Audio Return Channel works as it should.  The internet apps all work really near perfect.  I have stopped using the PS3 and Xbox to access any of the things the Sharp offers. 3D content of the Samsung was superior and the Sharp is not bad either. For those looking for size the sharp will work well after adjusting the picture quality.  If 60 inches is big enough than go with the Samsung.Sharp Aquos LC-70C8470UCalibration settings:OPC:  offBacklight: +10Contrast: +30Brightness: +3Color:  -2Tint:  +8Sharpness: 0C.M.S. -Hue: R- +6 Y- -1 G- 0 C- +16 B- -14M- -7C.M.S. -Saturation R- -3 Y- 0 G- -4 C- +14 B- -4M- -6C.M.S. -Value R- 0 Y- +5 G- +5 C- +7 B- 0M- -2Color Temp: Med-HighR Gain (hi): -30G Gain (hi): -3B Gain (hi): +3Motion Enhancement: AquoMotion240Quad Pixel Plus 2 (advanced)Active contrast (off)Gamma Adjustment: 0Film mode (advanced)Digital Noise Reduction (Middle)Monochrome (off)", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "70\" of 3D goodness.", "Author": "D.

I really have never been a fan of 3D films.  I thought \"Hmm... headaches poor picture quality, etc.\"  After seeing Capt. Eo and Honey I Shrunk The Audience at the Kodak Theatre in Disneyland, I wasn't impressed and got headaches from both films which are short in length.\"  This is what I figured would have the same or worse results from a TV and poor 3D effects because of the small screen when compared to a proper theater.  All I have to say is that I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of the Sharp LC70C8470U 70in 1080p Quattron 3D LED LCD TV.I have read complaints about this TV because of the \"Soap oprah\" effect on the picture when you watch it.  Yes when you have all of the enhancements enabled it is going to cause the effect.  All you have to do is turn these features off and voila all of these picture problems are gone.  There is a reason the TV features multiple image modes.Insulting the PQ of the TV because you do not know how to setup the picture modes is cheap, read the manual before you give a poor rating to the TV. And if you dislike the TV that much keep in mind that Amazon has a liberal return policy.  Here is my personal setup: Bluray and HD channels on my cable box need all enhancements turned off, 480i SD is appropriate for turning on the enhanced modes.  A hybrid works well for me when I play PS3Avatar in 3D, and all of the IMAX films are simply breathtaking.  Even Micheal Bay's Transformers: Dark of the Moon looks fab.  As a matter of fact only a few Bluray's look bad in 3D, namely Harry Potter 7 part 1, a film that was filmed in 2D and converted to 3D.  If you have the cash, buy the Sharp LC70C8470U 70in 1080p Quattron 3D LED LCD TV, you will not be disappointed.  My only suggestion is that if you are a Costco member, order it from their website.  It is $3199 minus $400 online discount, and free shipping.As a final note: buy a TV screen protector at least 1/4\" Lucite.  My 3 year old cratered my last LCD Flatscreen TV by throwing a toy into the screen HARD.  I also have read of many people doing the same when they have lost control of their Wii controllers or PS3 Move controllers embedding them into their poor TVs.  A 2-3 hundred dollar investment in a TV protector will pay you back in spades if you have a hard object hit the TV.  I learned the hard way.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Few Quirks, But Great Home Theater Investment", "Author": "Imran Anwar", "ReviewID": "R328I8H2EZHWJ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had invested in 60\" big screen rear projection TV when I built my home on Long Island and moved in here in 1995. And, despite being a gadget lover, I ended up not buying an HDTV until 2012. Even though I did not buy this at Amazon as I originally planned (love their service), I am posting this review to help encourage others to make the decision to buy this awesome TV.Among other reasons, knowing of my addiction to TV viewing once I sit down in front of it (Panasonic massage chair helps LOL), and pump up the Onkyo sound system (also now nearly 20 years old), I can while away the nights.... So, the longer I delayed an HDTV, the less likely I was to waste time... Which of course is better spent writing reviews instead of doing real work. :-)In any case, when I did go looking to buy an HDTV, I decided I wanted something that would also be a step up in SIZE, not just picture quality, from my Pioneer 60\" that has served me well. When the 70\" TVs came out, I went looking but did not find something I really desired.I finally did narrow down my choice to the Sharp 80\" in size and brand, but decided to wait for the 3D and Quattron version of it which was already available in the 70\" model. As soon as it became available, I added it to my cart and looked into ordering it on Amazon. But then I decided to pay my local Best Buy (Patchogue) a visit. I was delighted for several months with the no-pressure and VERY knowledgeable salesperson I got connected to earlier and told him how I truly believe in spending money locally, but not at the cost of hundreds of dollars in price difference. And, he got to work and was able to literally not just match the price I got on Amazon, he was able to get me 2 free 3D glasses that were not in the package. The hundreds he and his manager saved me, I showed loyalty to Best Buy with and bought other stuff for right then.The TV was delivered, and the delivery was great. The TV worked flawlessly out of the box. (Optimum's HD service, it turns out, however, had NOT been properly provisioned and they had to send someone over besides the time I wasted going 40 miles roundtrip to swap out my cable box for the digital one.)  But I also decided to buy the newer version of the SHARP Blu Ray media player (older versions had reviews talking about its slow network features) which was a great choice too. Both the TV and the player have enough apps built on them that I decided for now I will not invest in an Apple TV... even more so as I have decided the Yamaha A-3020 (forthcoming soon) receiver that I will buy to replace my Onkyo set up has Air Play etc. more than I need or have time for.Back to the TV, it truly is gorgeous, and optimal in weight and size. It is heavy enough to be sturdy but light enough to be placed on a merely $50 but surprisingly sleek and stylish TV table I bought at IKEA. Do make sure to have 2 people to install the TV, as it is not a one person job.Even in a well lit room (I live on the water in a windows filled home) the TV is easy to view in the day, and awesome at night. The 3D is spectacular - though, among the dumb things companies like SHARP do, I believe the 3D glasses are an older technology and will only work with SHARP's TV, and so I cannot use or swap other brands more up to date versions. I will look into this some more.The number of apps built in to the TV is impressive, and NetFlix (that I cancelled on their 60% price increase for mailed disks) has its own button. Several other programmable buttons allow you to add other apps.The quirks are in the typical things where one wishes Steve Jobs had kicked the butts of the people who design the user interfaces in things like entering usernames or on-screen keyboards. I also find the remotes on both devices both great and annoying. There is very little DETAILED thought to human interface design. e.g. The Review/Forward buttons would make more sense to have the Stop/Play buttons under them, e.g. You press Forward to jump ahead quickly and then press the button under it to get Play again... Instead, on the SHARP remote that is the STOP button. The PLAY button is closer under the Rewind(Review) button. In time I will get used to it but it is small things that show attention to detail, or lack thereof, in human interface design.Another annoying quirk is how little time the menu of Inputs to choose from stays visible after you press Input button.. .By the time I get to the up/down button to choose which Input a particular device is on (among the plentiful HDMI inputs) the menu disappears. In the meantime much less relevant menus stay visible seemingly longer.I have to say the audio on the TV is decent, but could use a little more oomph out of the box to enjoy TV or movies before one has hooked up or bought a new home theater sound system.In general, the only reason I am mentioning the quirks is to ensure people understand nothing is perfect, but I did not find these bad enough to not give it five stars.The one thing that is confounding is why several TV manufacturers are building Skype (now a Microsoft company) into their TVs but making it impossible to use. You cannot use any external USB camera except a $150 model from only one company that seems to make them for SHARP, Panasonic, etc. But, as I found out almost as I was about to buy that camera, you can then only Skype with Skype WINDOWS users, NOT with any other Skype platform, like Mac or smartphones of different types. I do not know if that is something being forced by Microsoft or the developer, but it was a definite show stopper for me on buying the Skype camera for this TV. Hopefully, whoever is behind that decision will come to their senses.Hope this helps you make a decision to purchase this great TV. I love it, and at the price of less than half of the newly available 90\" model, I have no regrets.Imran Anwar", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV, Plays all MKV format, but doesn't works with portable hard drive....", "Author": "Raman Glory", "ReviewID": "RZKFZ1GCSFFAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was waiting for this 2012 model TV since I saw it at CES expo, because this 80 inch is the largest 240hz 3d TV so far. I didn't expected this TV to release in March, 2012.Anyways I bought it from Amazon via Paul's TV for $4472+tax (Los angeles tax=8.75%). Cost me total of $4863.57 with free \"white glove\" fast delivery. Ordered on Saturday March 31st, and got it delivered on Monday April 2nd, barely just like next day delivery.Considering myself a smart shopper, I actually did some research for the price check. All other places were $1000 or more even at my favorite Frys electronics store, but I still went to Frys electronics to see this TV in action, but Frys personnel said it hasn't been put on display yet, as it's been barely 3 days since they recieved this model. Anyhow I told them at Amazon it's cheaper price, and they were just amazed! to see the price difference. The have to call their manager to match it up. Finally they were able to match it up but they came up with delivery fee of $75.00. I still wanted to go with it but somehow I just remembered that being a Chase freedom credit card customer, I get an additional 5% cash back on purchases made from Amazon.com for the first quarter of 2012. So I end up buying at amazon.com for bigger savings and free shipping with white glove delivery.Next day amazon bumped up the price for this TV. Lucky enough, I saved ridiculously $1000 just in overnight. I bet you they realized that they were selling the TV for a cheaper price than any other competitors.Let's get to the point of Cons and Pros of this TV discussing some key features and comparing with my other Samsung 55inch 8000 led series of 2010 model.Pros: It plays MKV format out of the box. Built in WiFi. Web browser.  Dedicated button for Netflix on remote. Hulu plus,YouTube with HD feature, Vudu, etc. Active 3D not like other 3D TV manufacturers which use passive technology. It's 240hz and motion plus to 480Hz, with contrast Ratio of 1:10 million. DLNA certified. More speaker output power of an additional 15 Watts of Bass as compared to all other LED TV manufacturers.Cons: It won't connect to portable Hard drive via USB. It only connects to electric powered hard drive and flash memory sticks (as written in instruction manual). When watching over the air channels via HD antenna, it won't give you detailed description of the TV program you are watching except the name of the program. It won't give you any info of the TV episode program in advance, that what is going to come next unlike my Samsung TV does. When using DLNA networking, it won't play MKV files. It only plays MKV files via when using USB port but not with portable hard drive as I said above.Rest if you want to buy any HDMI cables, or wall mount brackets, then I suggest you to buy at [...]. They are simply the cheapest.Any suggestions or questions are most welcomed.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best TV I ever bought!", "Author": "Kenny Putt", "ReviewID": "RQWRAWUR26C62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My previous TV was a Samsung 50\" DLP that served us quite well, but I was ready for an upgrade to a bigger 3DTV. So we pre-shopped TV's in electronics stores before buying the LC70LE847U through Amazon. We were looking for another Samsung when we started out, but it was easy to see which were the Sharp Aquos HDTV's on display, even from a distance. Comparable Samsung TV's simply could not match the picture quality of this Sharp Aquos Quattron and were loaded with (what many reviewers call) unsatisfactorily implemented and frustrating Kinect-like gadgetry. (Voice recognition, motion detection, etc.) That alone made me look elsewhere. Color, dark levels, clarity, smoothness of motion on this Sharp were simply unmatched in my opinion. I won't bore you with paragraphs of technical data - this TV is just, well, amazing. From regular cable TV programming (Verizon Fios) to streaming video (Netflix, Amazon, Vudu, Crackle) the picture is incredible. Even 3D content on Youtube accessed via the built-in app was great. 3D content on Blu-Ray was so good as to be startling. We've been amazed by content in venues like iMax-3D at Kennedy Space Center, and I never thought such quality could be had in my own living room.Don't expect a bundle of cheap pairs of 3D glasses with this Sharp TV. We bought a couple pairs of the Sharp AN3DG20B 3D Glasses (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JABSB6/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00) when they were on sale for $46 and change. Very well built and comfortable USB-rechargeable active shutter glasses and they work like a charm. Trust me, they're worth it.There is no \"app store\" for Sharp web apps, what you see is what you get - but what you get is incredible. No Amazon Instant (yet) but there is a fine selection of apps. And along with VUDU an app called \"Vudu Apps\" which adds many more streaming apps. (FYI, VUDU now has streaming 3D titles for rent and purchase.) Interesting: Netflix HD streaming is very noticeably better using the built-in Sharp app than that via XBox. Perhaps XBox's Netflix  is streaming in 720 rather than 1080p? And speaking of Sharp's web interface, the WiFi connection has been outstanding and flawless for me. I've had troubles with WiFi enabled Blu-Ray players and even Roku - not so with my Sharp TV.I also find XBox and PS3 gaming on the LC70 to be so good as to be...I hate to wear it out...startlingly good. But it's true. Halo4 and Mass Effect 3 are breathtaking.Although setup and installation was extremely easy and trouble free, I have contacted Sharp tech support a couple of times to register my TV and to ask questions about settings and features I didn't fully understand (I'm a card carrying geek and gadget-guy, but 3D at home was totally new to me). They are very easy to contact by phone, very pleasant and responsive. I couldn't ask for more.Delivery was fast; it arrived in perfect condition; the lift-gate truck pulled right up to my door and the driver brought it right into the house. And I got a great price from the seller \"Your Deal\" (www.amazon.com/shops/A1SPB9D2DMA0R4). The TV is somewhat heavy (96 pounds I think) so I had some friends remove it from the box and put it on my TV stand. I also bought a wall-mount kit in case I decide to mount it on the wall. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMFCIA/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00)Be warned - if you choose to look for one in your local big box store check the model #. Our local store wanted nearly $1000 more for the LC70LE (ON SALE), and it was the step-down model of the 847u. Another note: I usually don't buy extended warranties for electronics. \"Usually\" if they work out of the box they're good to go for many years. Certain things I believe are an exception simply because if something does go wrong out-of-warranty, they are very expensive to fix - almost the price of a new one (like laptops and large LCD TV's). So I purchased a 5-Year Warranty from Square Trade to go with it.

I just felt it was time to upgrade to a large LED Flat screen with 3D (for my grandson :)).  Ever since the2012 CES, I had been waiting for the new Samsung UN65ES8000.  However, between the horrible reviews of the 60\" version and the whole ES line for that matter as well as the fact that a best buy magnolia rep called it their \"worst\" TV, I gave up on the ES despite how nice I thought it looked aesthetically.  That said the Sharp look is also very attractive, encased in a classic black enclosure which looks great with my black Omni mirage speakers.In my search for the very best, I also came across the Sharp Pioneer Elite.  I have seen great reviews of the Sharp Elite TV.  I saw it at Best Buy, but they had its own special HD Blu Ray running in a separate area so it was difficult to compare to the others on display.  Since I have noticed that the quality of the input makes a tremendous difference in the picture quality it made me feel that they didn't want a direct comparison.  I am sure that it is a great TV as the reviews are great, but at a rather exorbitant price.  While I could afford the $7000+, I simply couldn't justify the 3X cost vs the lc-70le847u.  In fact, the other day I noticed that CNET had reduced the rating of the Sharp Elite from a 5 to a 4 star due to its excessive price and poor value.  I'd be willing to pay 50-100% or so more for the ultimate picture, but not 3X.  As I was finishing this review, Samsung just announced their UN75ES9000, a 75inch set selling for $9-10K.  Looks very cool, but again at what price?  Compare that to the top of the line 80 inch sharp (lc-80le844u) with outstanding reviews for under $5K.  $9-10K for 5 inches less and shabby reviews for the ES line; are they serious?Back to the lc-70le847u.  All in all, this TV is quite impressive at 70 inches.  I have found that the quality of the TV picture is directly related to the quality of broadcast.  There are scenes that are as sharp as you could possibly imagine and others where the resolution is simply poor due to the broadcast/camera quality and no TV can make up for that.  Blu Ray DVDs are fantastic.  Even normal tv looks 3D.  On the other hand, I can see the \"softness\" factor referred to in other reviews, but not enough to affect my overall rating.  I bought the Disney WOW Picture calibration disc and have adjusted the picture to a very satisfactory setting.  In addition, another reviewer on Amazon provided some very helpful calibration settings which we were much better than the factory settings.  I highly recommend you try his settings.I am extremely satisfied with this TV.  I ended up buying this on Sears.com for $2,400 from a Bountii price alert.  You gotta love some of the Sears sale prices.  I am really glad that I got the extra 5 inches vs. Samsung 65ES8000 and for about $1400 less.  If anything, I'd go bigger next time.  The sharp has plenty of apps, and I thought that apps would be really useful.  We use the Skype app but oddly enough I find that I spend most of my time watching TV programs and Blu Rays on what is after all, a TV.  The 3D is great, but some 3D movies are much better than others(Journey to the Center of the Earth is amazing!). One reason I went with the extraordinary value of the sharp was that it didn't obligate me to amortize the value of a much more expensive set over 5-10 years to justify the investment.  So I'll monitor the market over the next couple of years, and can buy another set if I choose as technology gets better and cheaper with the money left over.  In the meantime I remain very satisfied with this set!", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Defective TV and still not fixed", "Author": "Steve Prodger", "ReviewID": "RIMK3IYH1VAM8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ordered TV at the end of November with expected delivery Dec. 10th...didn't arrive till Dec. 19th.

I saw this at ABC and I was in love, lol. I had a 65 inch DLP  and I wanted BIGGER!  I looked at the Sharp 70 inch model and I also looked at the Mitsibishi 92 inch DLP. 1 was still too small for me and I really didn't want another DLP. I did see the Sharp 80 inch without the 3D, loved the size but wanted 3D with all the bells and whistles. This T.V is all I had hoped it would be. Watched my 1st 3D movie a few days ago and I couldn't be happier. For the size of this T.V the picture is amazing!  I looked for about a week trying to find the best price. I found them on Amazon for about 4,800. I went to ABC, they had these marked 5,699.  Told the salesman I could get it for 4,800 with no tax. He matched the price including the tax plus it came with 2 pair of the Sharp 3D glasses so i think i did very well. I said you got a deal and a few days later this beast was in my living room.i have seen them as low as 4,500, 4,600 for a few days here on Amazon, now I don't see those low prices for some reason. I bought the Samsung HT-6730W BD surround sound system and a beautiful black glass stand for it,  I couldn't be happier. I like the T.V on a stand because I have the room, I can angle it nicely for where I sit, and the view is perfect. Don't put any T.V too high on your wall. I see some people put them up way too high. Best viewing is your eye level to the center of the screen, closest to that will give you the best picture.  If you are looking for a big screen and can afford 5,000 bucks, I'd recommend this beautiful Sharp. You won't want to leave the house, lol. If you want BIG but can't spend 5,000 on a T.V I think the Mitsibishi's DLP's  are a nice second choice. I have 1 in my bedroom and it is pretty nice. I am adding this next part to my original review----  Had my Sharp set up for over a week now and I just realized I can have both of my window shades open on a sunny day and it still has an amazing picture! This is awesome, I always felt so shut in having to have all the shades closed to see my other T.V.  I am amazed!--------------- Well I've had it for 6-7 months now and I'm still as pleased as could be. Watching the N.F.L playoffs right now and all I can say is WOW!  This T.V still amazes me with how crystal clear the picture is on this huge screen. I seen someone was selling them for 3,800 now through Amazon. That is a great price!

They are the same price, so it was a no-brainer to get the one with extra stuff. To start, I play a lot on the Xbox360, have Directv and everything runs through a Sony BDV780w system.The Sharp is huge and if you have at least 8-9 ft distance, any room size is fine.

The brightness is top notch and there is little to no glare as you have a matte screen (to be fair, I also have black Eclipse curtains in the room with dark walls). Bright scenes in shows look great. Just watched Avatar 3D last night and it looked pretty good. I have an overly critical eye and in some scenes there was noticeable ghosting, in others it was flawless. Not sure if that is the tv's fault, the movie, or my Sony HTIB problem. Anyhow, bluray looks great.There are some cons that may lead me to return this thing though. It doesn't handle dark scenes all too well. In some movies/shows it does, in others you get noticeable artifact and it is annoying. I guess the cure for that is going plasma or DLP. Also, even with the motion enhancement, it doesn't handle fast motion or contrasting motion well...at all. The best example of how poor this is: I watched Inception through Directv and the snow scene towards the end when DiCapprio is sniping folks-when the camera is viewing through his cross-haired sniper scope and it pans over, the cross-hairs become horribly blurry.

I've had a work horse 55\" Sony rear projection for 7 years which hasn't needed anything but one replacement bulb and have been a passive observer of all the wonderful technological improvements in the interim.  I finally decided to do something after moving to a new place and wanted to keep the floor space open by wall mounting.  I had no predilection for any brand in particular and wanted to select the overall best bang for the buck.  In my opinion, if you're going to spend more than $2 grand on a big screen, you don't want to compromise much on picture quality, and you've got the space, you're not going to get a better value than the Sharp 847u.  Full disclosure, I've only had the TV mounted for about 28 hours but I am very pleased with it.  It really is Sunday Night Football like I've never seen it before.  I'm still reveling in the fact that the viewing area is a full 62% larger than my 55\".  If you're shopping in this category then how can bigger NOT be better?  Obviously you can take this logic out to the absurd, but what's relevant here is that there are many competing 60-65\" sets that cost the same or more as the Sharp 847u; 80\" and 90\" sets are still very much a novelty and you will pay a lot more to get there so I consider it an apples to apples comparison to competing 55-65\" options.This model has a 10,000,000:1 contrast ratio and 240 hz refresh rate which is a major step up for me and compares favorably with lots of smaller TVs with a much higher price tag.  Some people have a problem with 240 hz because the picture \"doesn't look like a tv\" or has a \"soap opera quality\" where it looks like close-up shots of people / faces appear as if they're actually in the room with you versus on a screen.  Isn't that supposed to be the point?  I haven't experienced any of the lag or jerkiness that some observers have - I will update if I do.I first started checking these out when they scored very high in the low-glare, high ambient light environment as I have a large window array in the family room.  This set does not lack in its ability to put out a lot of light and still had a very bright picture in the middle of the day.What's more, this beast is an energy sipper; the energy guide sticker is off the bottom of the chart with an estimated annual energy cost of $19.  It also is true AQUOS Quattron - beware some of the older models in this family are not.  This adds a yellow sub-pixel to the typical red, blue, green mix and allows for much more brilliant, metallic golds and a larger, smoother color range.I will be adding a Blu-ray player and active 3D glasses to the fold soon so I can't comment on the 3D as of yet.CONS (only applies to hardcore videophiles):LEDs in general  can't compete with plasmas on black levels.  For me, I would rather not have all that excess heat being produced in my house (live in the South) to get marginal, incrementally more black blacks.This is an edge-lit LED whereas you can get a previous model that is full-array.  I wish it was full-array, but I assume it's a production cost thing from a manufacturing standpoint.  Again, to me it is a marginal, incremental difference I don't want to pay more for in exchange for the higher contrast ratio, increased hz, and full 3D capability on this version vs. previous.The remote control itself isn't overly elaborate (or lighted) and using the browser is cumbersome because you have to scroll around to select every letter.  I did input a few websites and did some live streaming that I was okay with.Bottom line:  If you want to have one of the larger LEDs currently on the market that does quite well in all areas and you don't want to pay an exotic price, you should seriously consider this 70 incher.[...]", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome picture", "Author": "Jimbo", "ReviewID": "R2N71ZIMZB6G0C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, we've had this tv about a month now, so time for review.

I've tested this feature on a couple football games and the stadium looked recessed where it should. The 3D depth can be controlled too. It works best where there is an obvious difference in depth.3D broadcast: I tested \"the Lorax\" on Dish VOD and it looked great though there were some places where crosstalk could be seen.bluray 3D: in a word perfect! Very little crosstalk.HD picture: Excellent! Plenty of contrast for an LED edge lit TV and colors just pop!I have noticed while watching 2D content, the TV randomly and repeatedly tried to switch to 3D for no apparent reason. I noticed the 3D settings were in a more sensitive auto change mode (mode 2). After turning that feature off, I have not experienced that problem again so far. If this comes back I will amend this review. I also noticed a periodic horizontal grey band flashing in the upper black area while watching a widescreen VUDU HD movie (the Hunger Games) from a playstation 3. This did not affect the viewable area of the the movie. It was in widescreen with black bars top and bottom. the issue appeared in the top black bar occasionally during the film. I was unable to determine if that was an issue with the TV, the PS3 or the VUDU service (Stay tuned). If not for the random 2D to 3D flicker which was quite annoying, I would have given this a five star rating.

I made my choice and even used the settings recommended on this site to get an idea of the wide range of colors that are possible after the 100 hour break in period. I think I will have it calibrated just to see how well I did with his numbers and my fine tuning with a \"THX\" Blu Ray disk. Just had to tweak the blacks and whites to George's way of viewing movies. This Tv seemed very user friendly from the beginning. Once I found my wireless connection for the internet, it did the latest update, on it's own. The Tv's browser is ok, however without a keyboard I stayed with my Logitech Revue for Netflix, Amazon Instant Movie, and the rest of the Apps. It just was easier to hook up the Sony 3D Blu Ray player, my receiver, and cable box with the one HDMI cable from the Revue. Then once I started watching movies this really brought in the cleanest, picture and colors I have ever seen. Television broadcast are intense as well. I hung this monster on the wall and watched the season race opener of NASCAR at Daytona. It is so nice now when they break the screen up into smaller sections to show all the shots from in car or the pits. With this set the inserts are still larger than my Sony 40\". So now put all the extra shots on the screen and I don't care. Seems like only 12 to 18 months ago this size Tv was 10 times the price today. So watch your sale prices and when you want \"Awesome\" with 3D as a bonus run don't walk to buy Sharps latest and greatest big screen.

The original purchase was made in mid-August, but since then I'm on my 3rd replacement set. The first and second units had a MFG date of June 2012, while the newest replacement had a MFG date of October 2012. The reason for the replacements was a \"patchy\" effect in the corners of the screen, due to what I believe to be heat / pressure damage during shipment to the store. These large screens are very susceptible to pressure, and all thin screens are sensitive to heat.  This coupled with the tight fitting styrofoam packaging, I recommend checking this before purchasing if possible.Now, on to the operation and settings of the TV.I was very pleased with the adjustability of the TV, it has a great menu with a lot of options.  For the people who talk about the \"Soap Opera\" effect of this set, check your Advanced settings in the Picture Menu, and turn off Film Mode.  This is an option that gets rid of background blur, giving the \"faux 3d\" or \"soap opera\" effect.  I turn this option ON when watching live sports, as there is no reason to have background blur in them, but turn it OFF for all other viewing. You will be VERY surprised at the difference in picture.  I assume most other HDTv's have similar options as well.  The most recent firmware update from Sharp includes a bunch more apps such as Facebook, Pandora, Picassa and more. They've even included some games, but this would be better if the remote acted like a Wii-mote (I'm sure TV manufacturers will be going this route sometime in the future).  I paid $2099 for my set, and with the 2 year service contract, articulating wall mount, and installation... final total was right at $3000.

If anything, the performance of this set is understated.  When adjusted, and all have to be, it provides the most crisp and real picture that I have ever seen.  With it, you can actually recognize whether the crew was using a 1080p regular video, a semi-pro, a pro or a Hollywood camera with super quality lens.  Even though all are 1080p, it becomes easy to classify and judge the quality of network, Showtime, HBO and other contract products versus, say, a full Hollywood standard using mammoth and very correct lenses.Yes, you can now see all that with this Sharp. Understand, that it is not always good to see that well.  But, when the makers hit the mark, this Sharp is ready.  BTW, do not worry about 4K at all (though this unit will do that).  That is, products will be made by film makers for many many years to come, with tools that will be unable to even do a good 1080p finished product.With a screen like this Sharp, you will be able to track the industry progress over the next decade or so...Oh, eco buffs ?

This set came with 2 sets of glasses, and over the 847u it has the 480 aquomotion. I don't think quattron has any benefits, mainly a gimmic. I run Dish Network and HD is decent, not quite as sharp with some dark scene artifacting. Blu ray and video game performance is outstanding. Very impressed with motion, clarity, and color accuracy. I tweaked standard video mode, and am using Cnet's movie mode settings. The only other weakness is viewing angle, you don't lose clarity, but color gets washed out at medium to extreme levels the further you go out. I sit dead on, so not a factor for me. The bezel is nice and thin, matte black metal finish is very appealing. The apps suite is quick and intuitive. I use direct lan cable through the wall, so cannot comment on the WiFi. Overall I highly recommend this tv, I'm glad I took the carefree LED at 5\" bigger over the VT50. my last tv was the Samsung PN60E8000, so that is mostly what I have to go off of on comparison.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sharp support is a joke", "Author": "dominick deluca", "ReviewID": "R173U65M1N026D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV with high expectations.

My wife finally said that if I can get it a 'good' price then go ahead.I thought about getting the 120hz model but decided to go for the 240hz, better display,  and 3d if I could get it at a decent price. I defined a decent price if I could beat the online prices by 10% or more.I got permission just before thanksgiving. There were no deals to be had on black friday (day after thanksgiving). No deals on cyber monday either. On cyber monday I went to Pauls TV and they were not willing to deal at all. The next day Pauls dropped the price to $4,799 plus a $250 gift card plus pay the sales tax. The online price was $4,700 and did not include glasses.So, I went to Best Buy to see what their price was. They said $5,100. I said that the best you can do? They said yes. I then said ok, guess I am buying it at Pauls. They immediately price matched. I then said Pauls is throwing in a $250 gift card. They then knocked off another $250. I said Pauls is paying sales tax. Phone calls were made and they then agreed to pay sales tax. I said what about some 3d glasses and they agreed to throw in 3d glasses. What about delivery and setup? They agreed to throw in free delivery and setup. Bottom line was I was getting the TV for $4,550, plus 2 3d glasses, plus delivery & setup plus they pay the tax. I then asked is that the best you can do? Manager said I was almost getting it at cost. All the information was in the computer. I asked how long is it good for. They said 6 hours. I said OK, I am going to Pauls and if they can't beat it I will be back.So, off to Pauls I went. Told them what Best Buy would do. They had to make phone calls and do a lot of finagling on the computer. Bottom line was I got the TV + 3d Glasses + delivery + setup for $4,450. $100 less than Best Buy. FYI, this was not the same Pauls that I went to on cyber Monday.So the moral to this is that the big box stores will negotiate. If one location doesn't then try another one. I am thinking that the end of the month they may negotiate more because of quotas.Now about the product. As others have said, the screen is huge. We have a large great room that we put it in so it does not overwhelm the room. However, it does take a little to get used to. Do not watch low definition programming on it. Low definition looks bad.The sound is pretty good given the small speakers that they have to work with. I will probably get a sound bar to hook up to it.We have watched one 3D movie (Spiderman) and the 3D effects were OK. I am not a huge 3D fan though. I have experimented with the simulated 3D option and was not impressed.I was able to connect to my media server via the DLNA connection and it played the media just fine. The user interface is not that great so I will continue to use my WDLive box for playing media from my media server.I have played with the YouTube app and the YouTube videos look good. However, the UI for searching is lame.The TV should have included a keyboard.The remote is just OK. For this expensive of a TV it should at least be backlit.The picture is very good but sometimes the people look a little washed out. Especially on the 10:00 news and Leno.The USB port is not powered so you cannot connect a hard drive to it. Again, for this expensive of a TV they should have provided power to the USB ports.Football looks awesome.I connected my MacBook Pro to it and the picture looks good.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "J.

Its big, beautiful picture was crisp and had great black levels and color.  Bluray movies were great on this TV, gaming was pretty cool too.  The downside came about 3 days after the setup.  I started to notice 2 bright blue stuck pixels on the screen.  One about 2ft to the right of center and the  other was 1ft to the left - both about eye level and very visible when viewing a dark movie scene or even on someone's black jacket during a normal lighter scene.I tried a few pixel fixes I found on Google but nothing was able to fix them.  Over the next few days I counted 7 stuck pixels in total ranging from the bright blue to dimmer yellows and greens.  Needless to say I was very disappointed and took the TV back to exchange for another one.I got the new (replacement) TV home, set it up and immediately noticed a bright blue stuck pixel on the panel about 4 inches to the left of dead center.  I was really upset by this as this panel shared the same flaws as the previous one.  After some more research I found that others have had issues with stuck pixels as well and I'm not turned away from LED/LCD tvs in general.  I ended up purchasing a Panasonic Plasma and even though its only 65\" as opposed to 80\" I am much happier with the plasma as its picture quality is amazing.Beware the stuck pixels, they can really spoil your viewing experience and make you regret a large purchase like this.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sharp LC-70LE847U TV.", "Author": "A Phillies' Fan \"Phillies40\"", "ReviewID": "RYAP8ZK41UMK7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We just got it last night and we loved it so far.

I think the picture is great without any adjustments, although I thank those who have posted their recommendations and I will probably try a few of those just to see what I think.  But for those who do not want to \"tweak,\" have no fear, I don't believe you really have to do so.  I had a 2006 73\" Mitsubishi DLP, which was also an awesome TV, but lets face it, rear projectors are so old fashioned, it really dated the place.  This makes the room look like a real home theater!

A bluetooth keyboard like VIZIO E601i-A3 60-inch 1080p 120Hz Razor LED Smart HDTV uses might have been nice for entering passphrases.  I find that the wireless connection isn't going to work for me, even though I connected a new TP-Link N750 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router (TL-WDR4300) just for this TV.  Videos hang up since I only get 2 bars the way it's setup. I'll have to play with that a bit more, maybe try a house-wiring internet approach.Why only 4 stars?

If you don't know what these two features are, then you likely won't care about them.  These two issues did not contribute to my lower rating.  As I state in the title, the picture is beautiful and 3D quality is great.  However...there is one big problem with this TV; the built-in wireless is extremely weak!  I've accessed my network trying two different routers and the weak result was the same.  Currently, my router is about 20 feet from the router and the signal is no stronger than 1 bar.  I've also tried different network types with no change in result.  When reading other reviews I noticed others also commenting about a weak signal.  As I type this, I can't even get a signal on the TV from my network.

I got things hooked up and began viewing.I started with a BRD and thought this is fairly good. Not as good I as I was hoping though. I then tried some HD channels from my DirecTV box and also some standard channels.  These were worse.  I did not panic as I figure most TVs need some kind of break-in period and adjustments.  I spent days trying to adjust the settings.  When I got it good enough for one show, I really liked the PQ.  Unfortunately, when the next show came on via the same channel, the PQ was off again.End result, I returned the TV.  The back-lighting is uneven and no matter the setting or input, there is always a blueish type cloudy fuzz over the pic.  If you stare at it, it looks like it would look through an electronic camera lens that had a tough time seeing in a dark environment.

I am sorry to say the screen has cracks all over the screen surface. It looks like spider webs.  Called Amazon Customer Service and was taken care of in a very few minutes.  The Rep will issue me a refund and contact the shipper, Pilot Home Delivery, for a pick-up.  I am very disappointed the TV was damaged. Might be better to just purchase it at our local Best Buy and let them deliver it and set it up.  Not Amazon's fault, I was just trying to save a few bucks. It is funny Best Buy would of matched Amazon's price, I would just have to pay sales tax.
