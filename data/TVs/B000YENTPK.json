{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great 1080p LCD for the price", "Author": "Nicholas", "ReviewID": "R1UON05461WO3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the N4285P for over a year now and couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase.  There are a lot of people who complain about the picture quality of their \"HD\" set, but I think most don't realize that its their source that is the limitation.Television Sources:I was able to use Verizon FIOS with this set for a few months before I moved to a new location where they aren't available.  Oh how I miss the HD quality!  If you get a true HD signal with this set, you will be blown away by the color and clarity of the picture.  There is no visible ghosting or pixelation of the picture at all.  Flipping on Discovery HD theater would leave you breathless as you could make out the most minute details.  You could see the ripples and cresting of waves, individual feathers of birds, the pores in a persons skin, and the list could go on.  At my current location, I am counting down the months to finish out the 3 year contract of my old Series 2 TiVo, which looks absolutely terrible on any 42\" screen (considering it's a VGA output).  I will soon be switching back to FIOS where the HD capability of this model truly shines!DVD Sources:I am using a Panasonic 1080p upconvert DVD player with an HDMI cable.  The picture looks very clear on most movies, with no visible pixelation.  Even with some of the dark scenes from Lord of the Rings, where DVD upconverts have a notoriously difficult time, show the black scenes clearly and true to the picture.  This has been an impressive set to have friends over for movie nights, and I always receive compliments on the picture quality.  But I have to give equal credit to my quality Panasonic DVD player.  I'm biding my time until I can cash in my \"points\" with the wife and get a Blu-Ray player, where I can't wait to see how this set performs with it.Other Sources:Where I consistently get the most enjoyment is with my Xbox 360.  Using the HD component cables, the picture quality feels like true HD gaming.  The refresh rate never skips a beat and no there is no ghosting to take away from the picture.  Fallout 3 and Call of Duty 4 are my favorite games to play because of the beauty of the environments, and they are displayed in all their glory on this set.Summary:I am griping now because I am stuck using an old TiVo as my DVR, which makes my TV picture quality less than desirable.  But I have to stress that this is not the TV's fault, its my source.  My next door neighbor returned an even better quality Samsung LCD tv because he was dissapointed in the picture quality, blaming in the unit itself.  He still to this day will not accept that it was the tv source limiting the picture (even though I pointed out how amazing his 360 looked on it).  It will be a welcome relief when I get to switch back to HD in my new house.Earlier Viewsonic models did not have good components, but the latest models are coming equipped with Phillips screens, which should give you a pretty good indication of the quality of the screen.I would take any review on an HD TV that doesn't talk about the sources the user is viewing on with a grain of salt.  The TV is just one piece of the true HD recipe.  With this unit now retailing under 1k, its a really good deal where you will be getting an outstanding set, without the big name brand pricing of its competitors.PS.This TV risked getting a 4 star rating because of it's lackluster remote, which finally bit the dust a month ago.  I replaced it a Logitech Harmoney 550, which is compatible with this unit as well as every other device I own.  On a personal note, get a universal remote, it makes couch life much more pleasant!", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not Satisified", "Author": "Viewer \"DS\"", "ReviewID": "RCAOENQ4NU445", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV has lousy color.
