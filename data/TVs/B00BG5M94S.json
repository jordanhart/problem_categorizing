{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic picture, once you remove the Soap Opera Effect", "Author": "John Saylers", "ReviewID": "R2NF8YRJYY01YP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV about 2 weeks ago, based on the good reputation of it's predecessor (the 640U), and after a couple tweaks, I'm very pleased overall with it.HOW TO GET RID OF THE SOAP OPERA EFFECT:Turning off the Motion Enhancement alone will NOT solve it. You also have to go to Picture Settings -> Advanced -> Film Mode, make sure Film Mode is on, and turn down the \"Advanced\" item. I turned it down from 7 to 0 and viola - The Walking Dead no longer looks like General Hospital. Although it's not labeled on the menu, the manual indicates that this setting is the Judder Reduction.PICTURE: Right out of the box, Sports looked great, but all of our usual shows and movies looked very strange. Upon Googling the \"Soap Opera Effect,\" I found plenty of info on how to correct it, but when turning off the Motion Enhancement didn't do anything, I was pretty worried. I was almost ready to return the TV, but after playing around a little more with the settings, I discovered the above, and now everything looks AMAZING! We have it set on Standard Mode, and with the above adjustments, movies look like you're in the theater and basketball looks like you're IN the arena!SOUND: This is my only complaint. I was prepared for this after reading a lot of reviews - apparently the sound is bad on all of these new giant LED TVs. But it's really bad - sounds tinny, like it's coming out of laptop computer speakers. I just figured it couldn't be THAT bad, but the sound on my 37\" Toshiba destroys it. I paired the TV with the Sony HTCT260 Sound Bar Home Theater System which I got on sale for $250, and it sounds phenomenal! True home theater setup - couldn't ask for anything more. I'm not taking off stars for the sound issue since I knew what I was getting into going into it and had planned on buying a sound bar system.INTERNET: Wifi was easy to set up. I skipped it in the initial setup and went back in and did Manual Setup, and I was able to easily find and connect to my wireless network, just like connecting any other device. We don't have Netflix, so I haven't tested that, but I watched about 15 minutes of YouTube videos on there and it didn't freeze or buffer a single time. Pandora also works nicely for party music. I do wish it had Amazon Instant Video as an app, but I'm able to get this through my Blue Ray player anyway.MOUNTING: I mounted it on the wall with a Cheetah Mounts Plasma LCD Flat Screen TV Articulating Full Motion Dual Arm Wall Mount Bracket For 32-65\" Displays Up To 165LBS With 10' High Speed HDMI Cable With Ethernet Fits Up To 24\" Studs, and it feels solid and looks great. I love the thin frame and the fact that the Sharp logo isn't huge on there. Wish the power cable was a smidge longer - it was *just* long enough to get through the wall, out the bottom, and into the power strip.WARRANTY: I got a 3 year extended warranty directly from Sharp (that starts after the 15 month manufacturer warranty ends) for only $110.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "(EDITED) Good TV, but inspect upon delivery and look at the bottom of the screen...", "Author": "Michael 3:15", "ReviewID": "RMDSDRMWZKW9O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First TV that arrived was only carried in by a single delivery guy. When you test this TV, use a WHITE screen and be sure to view the edges. Mine had black flares on the bottom which I noticed while viewing a hockey game. Sharp's customer service was OK, but Amazon's has been great so far. Replacement arrived this AM and it seems better but I still need an hour or so with it to adjust the settings. The repair guy that Sharp sent said that the black flares were caused by \"pressure points\" in the frame which were probably caused by the television being dragged while in the box during delivery.Update:I have adjusted the settings based on what the other reviewer had posted. For my tastes, that picture is a little too dark. I increased the brightness and sharpness a little bit. However, those settings are a great place to start.For the price, this seems like a good tv. You definitely have to tweak it a bit to get good results though. I still notice some slight light distortion at the very bottom which goes up about an inch and a half. This could be caused by the weight of the television upon the bottom of itself. It is only really noticeable on a plain white screen, and it is much better than the previous one I had. Hopefully this will fade in time once the tv settles in.In regards to support from Sharp, well, it was OK, but they made me send them pictures. Amazon simply said, \"OK, we will replace it, no charge for shipping, no problem.\" You can't beat customer service like that. Everyone I spoke with at Amazon was very kind and professional. Thanks Amazon for putting customer satisfaction first and making the whole process as painless as possible.2nd update:After a few weeks, I am still noticing light flares at the bottom of the screen, they aren't really visible during dark scenes, but it certainly is taking the enjoyment out of watching my hockey games. Contacted Sharp and heard nothing back. Seriously debating returning. It's kind of like buying a new car and noticing a scratch on it you missed when you picked it up. Frustrating. Sharp...where are you? If anyone has a solution to the light flare problem, let me know! To return or deal with it...after a year will this still drive me mad? Will it get worse?3rd update:TV is going back on Friday. Sharp actually was very nice on my last few dealings with them, gotta give them credit for trying. But they said the lighting at the bottom of the screen was \"up to specs.\" It's really a pity because aside from this issue, it is a decent set. LCD does not have the brilliance of plasma though and the bottom of screen during hockey games looked like (and I'm quoting my gal here) \"the bottom of the screen is a crumpled piece of paper that got jammed.\" It didn't do it on the top or the sides, just the bottom. The cause is very likely the weight of the TV upon itself.Well, here's hoping that the new set I ordered is better. But now I'm reading that set has \"lag issues\" on gaming.I love Amazon, their customer service is top notch, but buying TVs through them is challenging because you can't see the model for yourself in person. You have to rely on reviews and research, which can be a blind buy. Luckily, their return policy is very lenient so you can find the right fit for the dollar and your needs.Goodbye Sharp, hello Panasonic I guess.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid TV", "Author": "Yuppers", "ReviewID": "R1C8FEOUKNZF0X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After semi-seriously researching new TVs for a month I finally decided to purchase the 60LE650U.  I auditioned it locally along with competing TVs I was considering (Samsung UN60EH6000 and Vizio e601I-A3 to name a couple).  The first things that stood out with the Sharp were the superior contrast ratio and deep black levels.  Picture coloration seemed quite natural...it didn't appear to be skewed towards any color.  Viewing in the store was enough for me to make my decision.I observed the same \"soap opera effect\" out of the box that other reviewers commented on and followed thier instructions for how to eliminate this.  After a little tweaking, motion seemed natural.  The first thing I tried out was the Netflix app.  After downloading an update, it launched Netflix no problem.  After initial buffering of 5-10 seconds loading a movie everything played smoothly with zero lag whatsoever.  I had previously been streaming Netflix from my computer to my old 720p Sony LCD TV.  In short, I had no idea the kind of resolution I observed on the Sharp was even possible through Netflix...I was blown away by the quality of streaming content (Thor was impressive to say the least).  I haven't made it through all the apps yet, but the ones I have tried and the interface are very nice.In dark viewing with very dark scenes a little edge bleed can be seen originating in the corners of the screen and progressively fading extending about 3 inches out.  This is quite faint however on my unit and is nearly impossible to notice under average viewing conditions.  That is my only minor complaint about the screen.  Otherwise the lighting and picture are very uniform and the overall quality of the set seems quite impressive for the price.So far, zero regret about this purchase & would make again...", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal set, and great value, but not 100% perfect...", "Author": "W. Hunt \"SegWayne\"", "ReviewID": "R2VXS0PCPUDMD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a Samsung 50\" Plasma which only lasted about 2 1/3 years (4 months out of extended BB warranty) that had suddenly developed the dreaded \"vertical blue lines\" down the center.  Originally, I thought to just bite the bullet and buy the 60\" Samsung LED that they now had on sale, but noticed that -- for $100 more than what I paid for my new Sharp -- it only had two (2!!!) HDMI inputs and no extended \"SmartTV\" functionality at all.In the first review I read here for my new Sharp 60le650 TV before buying, it was all about the \"Soap Opera Effect\" and how to turn that unintential setting off/down...  I'd point people to that review and say it's almost 100% on the money.  Once I turned off that \"feature\", the picture I get is just outstanding.What I can tell you about the Sharp 60LE650 sitting in my living room is this;- PICTURE QUALITY : Yes, out of the box, you'll want to tinker with the picture and sound quality settings.  You'll also need to turn DOWN the Picture Settings >> Advanced >> Film Mode to ZERO (not off, just down).  Because of the great reviews here, setting up my TV to my likings (and the DVD calibration thing) took about an hour.  Now that it's adjusted, I could not ask for a better picture quality.My one potential issue is the automatic dimming (Energy star settings?) of the screen to accommodate light or dark rooms.  In the older analog days, when a light turned on or off in a room, the TV set would adjust gradually (within a few seconds).  My Sharp (and I'm hoping it's only a setting) seems to be so sensitive that in a dark room, the image goes bright or dark instantly with changes to the scene on the screen itself.  Even a white screen being shown causes the TV to go a little wonky trying to self-adjust the brightness.I tried turning off the energy star auto dimming features, but then the screen got unbelievably bright/washed out and I couldn't figure out how to fix it.  As annoyances go -- as I said -- all TV's do the same, I'm just maybe a little unaccustomed to it on this set, having gone from Plasma to LED overnight.- SOUND : If you're used to massive, theater-level surround sound and 20hz to 20khz bass response, you will be disappointed by the built-in speakers.  There's just now way around that, but I'm honestly surprised by the idea that ANYONE could possibly be surprised by this.  Apples and Oranges.If you're like me (apartment dweller, courteous to my neighbors), the built-in speakers are just fine.  I turned on the automatic volume leveling -- to help with the annoying commercials -- and bass improvement options and *I* believe it'll suit me well.  It's certainly no worse than my former Samsung.  That being said, I've never really done surround sound receivers and such as it really freaks out the pets... :)- SMART TV options : The Sharp 650 series comes with built-in functionality for Netflix, Hulu, and seemingly a \"dozen\" other features including a web browser.  I tried the Netflix functionality out as soon as I got the picture sorted, and the best I can say is \"it works\".  I have to confess that I'm a bit spoiled, as I currently use an AppleTV unit almost exclusively for my TV time.  The AppleTV simply does it all better, faster, and more conveniently than the built-in functionality.  The only thing my AppleTV doesn't have is a web browser, but I could honestly never see using the TV's web browser for anything unless I bought a bluetooth mouse and keyboard or I was desperate and didn't have my iPad (or laptop) nearby.In summary, and all in all, Let me say this.For the price I paid (NIB, on sale), this is an incredible TV set for the money.  Unless you're expecting a $5000 TV for around the $1000 mark, you will not be disappointed.  Just know that you'll have to spend a little time getting it \"tuned\" to your own ideal picture.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with almost every aspect of the Sharp 60LE650.As for long-term life expectancy of the set, I can only hope it's better than the 2-year-old Samsung plasma it replaces, or that the extended warranty is worth more than the paper it's printed on.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a good price...for games, blurays and more", "Author": "The Darker side of Light", "ReviewID": "R38XS2WD9853OZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent hours and days and looking into TV's. I wanted a 70\" without spending more than $2k total! I game every now and then and watch blurays. After extensive research and lots of questions....Here's what  I found out and why I choose this model:For starters, there is NO perfect tv. Just like all other products, it comes down to personal preferences and money. If you are looking for the hands down uncontested winner with no equal, be prepared to spend $8k to $100k  (that's right 100k!) on true perfection. So don't kill yourself and waste your valuable time, instead look for the most \"bang for your buck\" you can get based on what is important to YOU.Refresh rate... 120mhz is fine and works great for this tv. The Truth is , the human eye can't even see \"refresh rate\" happening because it's to fast. Also this feature is only as good as other technical features in a tv. You could buy a cheaper tv with a 240mhz rate, but if it doesn't shine in other technical aspects, then it's just a waste and a gimmick to get you to buy it. Also , when it comes to gaming , don't believe for a second that your games will lag, run slow, and be worthless unless on a 240 or 600mhz (plasma) set....they won't!Smart-ness.  Ok if you have a smart bluray player with wifi, netflix, facebook...etc etc, then save yourself some serious money and get a tv that has all the same technical features but is not \"smart\" . But if you just have to have it, then let me say that all the smart features are great on this tv, the layout, the streaming and wifi all seem to work well, now...is this tv a PC??? no! Will surfing, browsing , chatting...etc be as good as with a pc....no! Are tv's as \"fast\" as your pc....no!!  Computers are better at computer stuff than tv's are, hands down.  Are they acceptable  on this tv....yes! But no tv is going to give you the same experience as your laptop, desktop or even tablet...not yet anyway but in the future im sure they will all be one in the same.You can put music, pictures ..etc on a usb and this tv does a good job of playback and the \"standby slideshow\" thingy with your pics on usb is neat!Gaming-- Stunning! I grew up playing games on CRT...black and white ones at that! So when I read about the difference in gaming from LED vs Plasma....I just wanna slap somebody. This tv has game mode, but I have seen no differences or delays between modes. If you have some settings turned way up or maxed , you may experience slight nunances in picture BUT game mode takes care of that and once you get the settings just the way you like them, you will be amazed. the quality is so clean and crisp4,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio - this has a lot to do with clarity, crispness and cleaness of the picture. by contrast compare a top seller like Vizio...cheaper tv , has alot of neat features ...and that magic 240mhz refresh rate...buuuuut  has 1000000 to 1 contrast ratio! 75% less than this tv! So again, what good is that 240mhz if you don't have the technical goods to back it up. This tv looks better than the 60\" or 70\" Vizio's that I was comparing it to. I went to wal mart and saw a big differencePicture -  Outstanding, blurays look jaw dropping. You can shut off the soap opera effect and the images will still look brilliant. I actually ripped a segment of one of my blurays , put it on usb and nobody could tell that it was being played from a usb stick and NOT a bluray.  it looked that goodI recommend that you get the Disney WOW bluray to calibrate the tv. You can calibrate each mode and then adjust it to however you want afterwardslike with all flat tv's ....you will need a sound bar. the speakers are in the back and it sounds crappy. but they all do.there is minimal glare from the screen and that's a huge plus living in sun drenched south!It's light and energy efficient....DNLA compatible !!tons of connections!I can go on and on... this tv is just plain great. It does everything I want it to. I couldn't care less if it's not 3D, I can't stand 3D anyway so it works for me.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "TexasDave", "ReviewID": "R2FTY1XMMJIB9F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I want to thank the person who gave instructions on how to remove the \"soap opera effect\".  LCD TVs never looked right to me and I could never really put my finger on what was wrong but when I heard that term it explained it perfectly. That issue was the main reason I have not upgraded my DLP TV sooner.  I figured it was just something I would have to get used to like projection TVs and bright rooms.I have had the TV for a few days and I am extremely impressed.  I upgraded from my 65\" DLP which had gotten to the point where it couldn't be seen with much light in the room.  I never realized how bad it was and how much of the picture I was missing until I saw this TV, the colors and picture are amazing.  One thing that impressed me coming from a projection was it seems to have a true black which I thought only plasmas were capable of.  I don't care much about smart apps but the Netflix one works great over wireless.  For the money you can't beat this TV and I can' think of anything I could get with a more expensive TV that I would enjoy.The only real issue I have with the TV is the remote, it works but its cheap.  Its not back lit and isn't really a true multi-device remote.  The TV relies too much on Aquos Link so if you don't have a Sharp soundbar forget about controlling volume on an external sound device with this remote.  I have a Logitech Harmony remote but sometimes I just want to touch one button to do what I need to do.  For those of you concerned with the sound of the TV, TVs with decent sound went away with tubes and rear projection which were basically gigantic heavy TVs with room for big speakers, get a sound bar or receiver with speakers.  If you buy a big screen HDTV and don't have some kind of real surround sound you are missing out.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture, fair price, unique Wallpaper mode", "Author": "John White \"weasel rancher\"", "ReviewID": "R3QGSLZ771WUVG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the 60\" Costco version of this TV a few months ago. As long as you put it into \"Game\" mode, you won't have the Soap Opera effect, which is obviously terrible. You can turn off a lot of options to try to get there, but Game mode is the only sure way to escape it. I've played a small set of video games and it looks great. Can't comment on other fast action since I don't do sports.Built-in web browser, Netflix, etc. apps are slow and terrible. I have an AppleTV, with a massively better Netflix interface. Apple TV also let's me AirPlay my Mac screen so I don't have to use Sharp's awful web browser.Remote is fine. Audio out is weird because when you switch it to \"fixed\" to play from a separate speaker system you still get the volume slider, which will even decrease the volume as you drop below \"0\" on the 0-100 range. So that's dumb, but benign.I'm really a fan of the gimmicky feature of Wallpaper Mode on this thing. Only models 60\" and higher have this. You load images you like onto a flash drive, leave it plugged into the back, and when you turn the TV \"off\", it instead goes into very low power (they won't say how much) mode and rotates among your chosen images every 3 minutes. After a set period (24 hours max), it goes fully off. The TV doesn't exactly look on since the images have low brightness, and it's really nice to see some art pics I grabbed from Wikipedia rotating on shuffle in lieu of a giant black rectangle. Nice feature that maybe uses the energy of a 20 watt bulb by my guess. When the TV is fully on, I think it uses ~ 120 watts, so the same energy cost of a very bright incandescent bulb. They have a YouTube clip detailing this feature.I guess some TVs are better, but the marginal returns of extra expense seemed irrelevant to me. I looked at sets that were 50-100%+ more expensive, and couldn't see the difference. Nice price, very bright display if you want it to be. Unique Wallpaper mode. Very thin profile. 60\" model is only about 67 pounds. Soap Opera effect escapable. Clean plain black appearance with one very subtle brand logo. Even the power-on light can be deactivated.

I ordered it on Tuesday afternoon and it arrived via Eagle Trucking on Thursday morning. The drivers unboxed the set, attached the stand and placed it on my credenza. They plugged it in, attached the HDMI cable and ran the initial setup. They did all of this in less than 20 minutes. I would rate ordering and delivery as exceptional.Setting up the Wi-Fi connection was a little confusing, but on my third try I succeeded. Most of the problem was me not following directions properly.I was upgrading from a 6 year old Samsung 50\" DPL, the difference in the picture quality was tremendous. Right out of the box, without any adjustments, the picture looked good. However after watching for a few hours I noticed some scenes seemed a little washed out and others seemed a little over saturated. There are a total of 41 adjustments you can make to the picture quality. I made a few tweaks, and oh my lord, the picture was terrible, I totally screwed it up. Sharp does offer dedicated AQUOS advisors to assist and help you by phone and through Wi-Fi. Instead I decided to try to find the proper settings on-line. I went to the [...] and found a lively discussion about this TV's immediate predecessor the 640U. (my set the 650U had just been released) Sure enough someone had posted a complete set of tweaks. I applied them and they pretty much worked. The picture was almost beautiful! I made one minor adjustment changing the AV Mode from STANDARD to USER and my wife and I are happy campers. I just came from a friends house where he had just installed a 60\" Samsung that cost over a $1,000 more than my Sharp and I believe my picture is as good if not better.As to the SMART features, NetFlix and Hulu Plus are very good. When I first tried to log on to NetFlix a message on the screen told be to upgrade the firmware, I clicked a button or two and within 5 minutes the firmware was up-to-date and NetFlix was working. I can't say much for the included games or for the Browser, and the other Apps are OK. I do wish they had an Amazon App for viewing Prime movies.The remote is OK, nothing special, the keys are a little cramped and it is not back-lit. I use a Harmony One so a lackluster remote is not a big concern.All in all I would make this purchase again. I think at the price this Television is a very good buy.UPDATE: 4/13/13After two full weeks with this TV I am happier than ever. The picture is sharp and very clear. The colors are brilliant but not over saturated. Blacks are very dark with just very minor light bleeding at the corners, nothing to get upset over. The only quibble I have is the \"Apps\" are just so-so. The browser works but typing with the on-screen keyboard is simply not worth the effort. I have an AppleTV I use for Netflix and Hulu so the Apps are not really a concern, and I never intended to use the TV for surfing the internet.At the price, this TV is worth every penny.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely LOVE it!!", "Author": "CaptnInsano \"Ryan\"", "ReviewID": "R34FQHNVN0ZUEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic TV!

I called Sharp and got through rapidly. They had me reboot, push several buttons, and read them the data from the screen. Then they had me take pictures. Shortly thereafter, they called to say that they will replace the set, including delivery and installation. I will update once this is done.Update 5/3/13The set is still working perfectly. Pictures from DVD and Bluray are superb!! We are watching Homeland on standard DVD from Netflix. It looks like we are in the studio!  On Bluray, my favorite test is the Rolling Stones IMAX disc. Wow!!On the web side, I am now using a Microsoft K800 wireless keyboard and mouse. It works perfectly. I did add an 18\" USB extension cord so that the wireless dongle attached to the set now hangs a bit below the TV and hence has a clearer RF path to the keyboard/mouse. I was able to use the TV's browser to stream the Sanford/Colbert-Bush debate the other night. The off-the-air TV is great also. Picture is superb. The sound exposes the problems at our local TV stations in Savannah. Most insist on transmitting fake \"surround sound\" instead of pure stereo or mono.I asked Sharp about forcing the set into pure stereo or mono mode per the instructions on page 17 of the manual. They indicated that the TV can only toggle between sound modes actually sent by the station. Since our local stations only send \"surround\", I am stuck with that. (BTW - The Sharp online question services are great. They provide good answers in a day or so via email.)Overall, I would say that this set is so good that it exposes problems in poor source material.______________I bought the 70LCLE650u about 2 weeks ago, and it is fantastic! I'll write a longer general review when I get more experience with it. I used the Amazon free delivery, and it was here in SC in about 5 days.I don't have HD Sat or cable, but off the air HD from NBC (Savannah)is outstanding. I also tried a Bluray disc of the Rolling Stones on IMAX (via a separate multi-channel sound system)and picture quality is superb.The sound from the built-in speakers is poor (as expected), so I rigged up a homemade sound bar using a Lepai 2020a amplifier (about $25 from Amazon) and a Zuni ($15 from Amazon) smart strip that turns on the amp when the TV comes on, and off when the TV goes off. That drives a pair of ancient AR2ax's for normal TV news watching. A normal sound bar will also do the trick. I especially like that the set remembers separate volume settings in each input mode.Wireless setup was easy, although I had to turn on my wireless beacon or the TV would not detect the SSID. It did not want to accept manual input of the SSID.I tried a Logitech K520 wireless keyboard (from my main PC) on the browser, and it works as expected. A real keyboard such as this is far,far superior to using the Sharp on-screen keyboard. This rig is not a replacement for a PC, but Google searches and movie data look-ups, and news work just fine. I'll now buy a smaller wireless keyboard.My two pearls of wisdom thus-far:1 - Be prepared to use outboard speakers. The sound of the built in speakers on any of these flat-screens, especially with thin bezels is wretched.2 - If you are going to use the browser, buy a real wireless keyboard.So far, so good. This set offers a tremendous picture for a good price.Thanks all for the soap opera info.

Knowing that I didn't want to break the bank, I looked at both this 70\" Sharp and the 70\" Vizio. While I haven't seen the Vizio in action (wasn't able to find it at any local stores), I'm quite happy with my choice.Out of the box, the picture settings need a fair amount of tweaking -- something I don't recall ever having to do with the Panasonic, but so it goes -- but I found CNET's recommended settings online and used them to get rid of the soap opera effect and balance out some colors, then I adjusted the brightness and sharpness a bit further to account for my own tastes. When I'm watching something like Sportscenter, the faces of the anchors still seem to have a bit of a pinkish hue, but I'll eventually get around to trying to fix that as well. Even if I can't get it perfect, I'm happy. Everything else looks great, and high-definition nature shows in particular are downright hypnotic.The sound on this TV is not great (but after reading so many negative comments, I expected worse). I had to rely on it for a few days until I realized that my old analog audio cables wouldn't work and I'd need to order a digital audio output cable. Like all large TVs these days, the speakers on the TV are a bit tinny, so I would certainly recommend connecting it to a surround sound system at some point (I use the Panasonic BTT190).I love having 4 HDMI ports (up from two on the old TV), enabling me to connect the cable box, a PS3 and the Blu-Ray player and still have an extra slot. I have not yet used any of the other ports on this TV, but there are several.All in all, I'm quite satisfied. For the price, I'm not sure you could get a better TV. I guess the only thing stopping me from giving it five stars is the amount of work required to get the picture to look right, but perhaps that's just a fact of life with all of these large LED televisions.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "Marathon Freak", "ReviewID": "R32LI6XOPQAWS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really a great TV for the money.  I had a four year old 46\" Sharp Aquos LCD TV that I replaced with this one simply because I wanted a bigger screen.  I was satisfied with the picture of the old Sharp and this one didn't disappoint me either.  And that's where this TV's strength lies.  I didn't need to make any adjustments out of the box but I haven't run any special calibration software against it either.  It just looks good.  I mounted mine to the wall.  I thought it might look too big up there but it doesn't.  Sharp's wallpaper feature is pretty sweet.  Turn the TV off and it goes into a low power standby mode and displays some canned art making it look more like art in the room that a giant black rectangle on the wall.  Put some of your own pictures on a USB stick (in a folder named \"WP\"), and it will cycle through those.With 4 HDMI ports, 2 USB ports, and other connectivity (component, composite, etc.), this should meet all your connectivity needs right out of the box.I didn't have any issues with the speakers but I generally run everything through an AV receiver.  When I do use the speakers, they're just adequate.  Nothing special; nothing terrible.I'd definitely recommend this TV.Buying from Amazon is easy but shipping can be dicey.  My delivery was less than seamless and the shipping company (Ceva Logistics) was extremely questionable.  Their 800 number had a message saying their long distance was disconnected and the number you get from Amazon to call them is always either busy or disconnects after multiple rings.

I assembled it in 5 minutes with the help of a friend.The menu is a bit unwieldy compared to the smooth, slick menu of LG and Panansonic.  But you get used to it after few minutes, and once you finish configuring the settings you will rarely use the menu again.The TV has zero dead pixel and the BEST screen uniformity of any LCD/LED TV I've seen, even though it is an edge-lit TV.  Screen uniformity is better than my direct-lit LG LN5700.I selected Game picture mode and tweaked the settings.  I recommend using game mode only.  Game mode has very low lag and no soap opera effect.  When watching movies in the dark, simply dial down the brightness.  If you like film effect, choose a warm color temperature.The black level feels like night and day compared to my LG TV which has an IPS panel. IPS panels offer great color saturation and viewing angle, but at a price of light black level.  This TV has inky blacks, but shadow details look slightly crushed.  Also, skin tone sometimes looks slightly unrealistic.Color reproduction is great. Coupled with excellent black level, the picture (especially nature scenes) looks almost real.I ordered a Sharp 757 before.  It is a lot worse than the cheaper 650.  The 757's game mode has a ugly red tint.  The Quad Pixel technology (adding a yellow pixel in addition to the standard red, green, blue) does nothing to improve picture quality.

There is little I love more than going to the theater and getting lost in another world for two hours, watching the hero get the girl and ride off into the sunset.  Accordingly, I am ever working to improve my home viewing experience.  This TV has greatly contributed to my personal cinematic experience (that, and my 700W surround sound system).As a cinephile, one thing I want is total control over my viewing experience, and the LE650 delivers on that.  The amount of features, settings, and adjustments you can make to the picture, frame rate, color, sharpness, etc., are staggering.  Although it drove my wife nuts, I spent nearly a half hour one night adjusting every color setting the TV had until I could hardly distinguish between a photo and real life.  The movement is smooth, with no ghosting or afterimage.  The blacks are very rich, and the TV gets surprisingly bright, though if you're like me, you'll probably want to disable the adaptive lighting feature which seems to serve only to make sure the TV is always just a little too dim for current conditions.The sound isn't bad as TVs go.  The dynamic range is decent, though like any built-in speakers, you'll miss out on some bass, and some of the crisper, higher pitches (like dialog) will get lost in busy scenes.  If you're an audiophile like I am...I would highly recommend dropping a few extra bucks on an external sound system, even if its just stereo sound and a subwoofer.  I will say, however, that this TV gets surprisingly loud.  It goes up to 99 for volume, and I don't think I've ever had it beyond the teens.There are copious inputs, including 4 HDMI inputs.  My favorite feature about the HDMI ports (aside from there being 4 of them), is that they are side facing in the back of the TV and recessed enough to make cable hiding easy.  Additionally, there is a digital out (S/PDIF), USB in, HD component in, composite video, and many others.Perhaps most importantly for modern viewing, the TV sports both an ethernet connection and built-in Wi-Fi.  I have not hooked up the ethernet, but the Wi-Fi works like a charm.  Less than 30 seconds after the TV comes on, the Wi-Fi is online and I'm watching the latest episode of House of Cards on Netflix.There is a decent lineup of built-in software, including YouTube, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and others, though Amazon Video on Demand is lacking (fortunately I am able to get that through my Blu-Ray player).  There is a web browser built in, but it is kind of clunky to use with a remote.  I do not know if the TV can take an external mouse and keyboard, though these would be welcome.  Consequently, browsing YouTube videos without a remote app or trying to surf the web can be a pain.  Also, I found that some plugins don't work properly on the Aquos' web browser.  When trying to make an embedded video go full screen, it would pop-out for a second, then back.  I bought it to be a TV, though, not a computer, so this doesn't detract from my rating.This is a very nit-picky item: the Aquos has \"Aquos Link\" which gives it the ability to control other devices, but the execution is somewhat inconsistent.  There is no way to manually tell the Aquos which devices you have, so if it doesn't detect or is not compatible with your devices, oh well.  Even if it dos connect to/control your devices, it doesn't seem to have the ability to turn them on and off with the Aquos remote, so if you were hoping to thin the remote herd on your coffee table, it's not going to happen.  Also, the button functions on the Aquos do not necessarily line up with other devices, i.e., the fast-forward/rewind buttons on the Aquos remote actually make my Blu-Ray player chapter skip.  Again, though, it's supposed to be a TV - not a media center control system.Overall, after about two months, dozens of HD TV episodes and movies, I can unequivocally say this was a fantastic purchase.  My wife and I have always loved curling up on the couch and putting in our favorite movies, and this TV has only made us more of a pair of couch potatoes.

Using Game Mode is a must if you are playing action games, the other picture settings have too much lag.  For movies I'm currently using Movie Mode with the Film Mode turned down low.  This helped with some of the motion problems movies have.EDIT:I found that it take a bit to long to turn on by default.  I turned on a setting called Quick Start Mode (and on my receiver I turned Standby Sync to On) and it turns on much faster now at the cost of a few watts.Also I found while I can pass through DTS and Dolby Digital encodings through the TV, I could not get Windows to configure the speakers as 5.1.  I'm guessing this is because the EDID of the TV is wrong or it only has the bandwidth equivalent of optical.  I didn't bother trying to work around this so my PC is now the only connection to the receiver.

Coming from a 55 to a 70 inch I was floored by the size.  The motion enhancement I actually really like and it makes everything look and move like real life to me, which I much prefer to looking at judder in a panning scene (which the motion enhancement also eliminates).  I like all the features it has but will never use them as I prefer external devices rather than built in apps any way.

Great brand with a long history in making LCD displays, great price, nice looking.  I have its little brother at my office so I already knew the UI.  But I don't watch movies at work, and I couldn't notice the problem with a delay between audio and video.  This is especially noticeable on the B's and M's on the speaking parts.I first noticed it on an external BluRay DVD player, which was brand new.  Then I tried a Roku and of course the internal smart TV.  Problems everywhere until I tried the X Box.  I used the component outputs from the X Box 360.  Hmmm.After reading the forums, they basically said to turn off all the video processing or put it into game mode to speed up the video decoding.  This did help, but it was still noticeable.  I thought about just using the X Box to relieve the CPU in the TV from decoding the HDMI, but component out s a dying technology.So, I took it back to the store where I bought it.  The crew was incredulous, so they set it up with a DVD player.  The process was painful, as it took them nearly 10 minutes.  Finally, they got it running and two of the three people from the store who were apparently just there for the entertainment of it all said - yep, I see it, and walked away.  The third guy gave me my full refund.My lessons learned.  A great display brand does not necessarily a great TV brand make.  Slow video processing on HDMI inputs can cause the audio to be decoded much quicker than the video, resulting in a lip synch problem.  Since most sources don't allow you to set a delay, you have to deal with the problem in the TV.Which is where my story ends.  I picked up a Samsung 6300 series in its place which does not exhibit the problem at all.  It even has a programmable audio delay.  Nice touch.  It also has Amazon Prime which the Sharp did not have, which is one of my favorite streaming sources.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love This TV", "Author": "mmmoritz", "ReviewID": "RUN7EX3G73DM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this TV via Amazon Prime.

I am generally very satisfied with this TV.  The virtual mouse is virtually useless, so I connected a USB wireless keyboard and mouse that are much easier to use.  The web browser seems quirky, but usable.  It took me a bit of tweaking to adjust the picture to my liking.  Picture adjustment is complicated due to certain menu items changing settings made on other menu selections.  I guess it's just a matter of learning this particular TV operation.  I like the automatic firmware update feature.  Setting up this TV to connect to my home network was easy, and I like the way I can view all my photos with background music of my choosing.  I find the picture quality is inconsistent from program to program and channel to channel, but after optimizing my settings of brightness, contrast, back light, and color, I am relatively satisfied.  Also it helps to get used to this picture for a week or two.  It is certainly capable of better 1080 i or p HD picture quality than my two year old 47 inch Toshiba, but perhaps not as good with lower resolutions.  I almost regret not getting a smaller size 50 or 55 inch since I view from about 10 feet away and 60 inch screen might be too big.  Handle with care to avoid introducing light bleed from edge lights.Forgot to mention that sound is better than every other flat screen I have owned over the last ten years though it is not great.  One thing I really dislike is that since I watch broadcast TV, this TV does not display start or stop times of programs, and it does not display program information or following program schedule.  Also the various \"stretch\" modes of viewing give very strange distortions when the screen image pans horizontally.  Without using these stretch modes, the picture sometimes shows a top edge that is very annoying.

I was a little hesitant purchasing such a large item from anyone other then a local brick and mortar just in case there was something wrong. Well the first tv purchased arrived with a crack on the bottom plastic by the speaker. They sent out a replacement which arrived a week later. Unfortunately i noticed a narrow block of what appeared to be dead pixels along the side of the screen that was about an inch long. The second tv was replaced and received this one which is great. Through the process the price had dropped and they credited me that as well.As far as the actual tv I've owned it for several months now. For the most part I love this tv although there are a few hiccups. I think the picture quality is pretty good for such a large screen at this price point. You just have to be aware of what the actual source material is. The tv isn't a magician it's not going to make standard definition look spectacular. I do occasionally see a glimpse of the soap opera effect but it's not horrible over all. The screen is matte which does a great job of not reflecting the light in our living room. Our previous tv was a Samsung 55\" LCD which had a glass front panel and was horrible in the middle of the day to watch. The smart tv features are pretty basic but I wasn't really looking for that because we have a Apple TV and PS3. I actually was looking at the model below 550 but this was the same price and it had wi-fi to do any of the firmware upgrades. The one thing it's missing is Amazon Prime video which would make it great. I can't say much on the audio as I've only heard it through the tv speakers  few times but I'd suggest a surround system because it's a night a day difference.

The reviews were good, and I was very excited to receive this thing.When the TV finally arrived, I eagerly unpacked the TV from the box and began to set everything up. I couldn't wait to turn it on. It was beautiful out of the box--I was sure it would be spectacular once displaying its picture. So I'm setting everything up and get to the part where I need to arrange the stand. I get the metal pieces that connect the base to the TV, and realize I don't see the screws that fasten those plates to the TV. I check the box again. I check all the styrofoam pieces. I check the floor. I check everywhere. But no screws. Since I wasn't going to wall mount the TV, the stand was my only option, so I was stuck with no TV, and really nowhere to put the 70\" screen.Frustrated, I called the Aquos product support, and they quickly rogered up to sending the screws. Now, after spending all this money on a TV, I expected to hear \"our fault, so sorry, these are coming to you overnight, you should see them tomorrow.\" Instead, when I inquired how they were being shipped, I was told normal ground. I almost blew my top, but calmly asked to speak to a supervisor. I wound up having to call back and waste a day. When I finally did speak to a supervisor, she quickly agreed to overnight the screws. So, I'm taking a star off for hit and miss product support, and lack of screws in the first place. To the guy or girl whose job it is to get those screws in the boxes--dude, you had ONE JOB TO DO!The TV itself, once I finally got it secured to the stand (a two-person job, is awesome. There was some motion jitter at first during sports and scene panning, but we got used to it. After making the setting adjustments to get rid of the soap opera effect, we have completely enjoyed the TV. Sadly enough, one of the features that tipped the balance for me between this and other contenders--the ability to use the TV like a digital picture frame--is a feature that my wife will not let me use, since she doesn't want people looking through our window while we're not home and realizing we have a nice TV. Come on!Anyway, my only other minor complaints are the sound (adequate, but not great, but we expected that since it's a well-known issue), and the clunkiness of the web interface.

This was to replace our old 42\" plasma TV.  The picture is amazing.  The TV is very lightweight and thin and even though I doubtfully will use the Smart TV features, since this was the same price as the non-smart TV, I opted for this one.  I have a Bose 3-2-1 surround and along with this TV I have an XBox 360 and a Playstation 3 hooked up to it.  The PS3 is my BluRay player as much as my main gaming system. I also have DirecTV.  With my old TV I had my PS3 hooked up to my digital audio input of my Bose so I could watch BluRay disks in surround sound.  Everything else was hooked up stereo since there is only 1 digital input on the Bose.  This Sharp TV has a digital out as well, and according to the documentation you can hook up all of your external devices to it via HDMI and then use the digital audio out to your surround sound system.  I did this only to discover that Sharp, as well as most other TV manufacturers, do not send Dolby Digital signals out of the digital output of the TV if the signal comes from an external source (such as the HDMI input from DirecTV).  This completely defeats the purpose of having a digital audio out.  I believe Vizio, Sony and Toshiba TV's will pass the Dolby Digital signal through their digital audio out, but Sharp does not.  At least not on this TV.The other thing I discovered is that it also will not pass the Dolby Digital out from external sources from their Smart TV offerings such as Netflix and Hulu.

Also, when the point in the episode is reached where an ad is shown, the ad does not play and the show never resumes. I asked Sharp if they would be updating the browser to resolve these deficiencies, but received no answer other than the web browser isn't full function.Thus, my assumption is they have no plans. I would think they would integrate a standard browser such as Chrome rather than implementing their own proprietary browser.

As TV's get thinner, the quality of the speakers suffers. This is certainly understandable. But what really blew me away was how loud it was BEHIND the tv. Yes. It is incredibly loud behind the TV, more so than in front, I think. So when I have the volume up, it blasts through the rest of the house instead of toward me on the couch. It is very irritating. The quality of the sound, though, is actually not as bad as some reviewers have said. I think it sounds reasonably good, it's just going in the wrong direction!The other option I may try is to attach the optional sound bar. What I don't know is if you can bypass the TV speakers completely when using this option. If so, I'd buy them tomorrow because this is really annoying. If any of you know the answer to this, please let me know!Aside from the sound, this is a darn good TV. Setup was a snap, streaming is gorgeous and effortless and it has PLENTY of extra connection options in the back for all of your devices.

They made me fill out a bunch of forms and nothing happened.I have 38 emails from them and each time I responded to them, I was told that this email doesn't accept messages!Why would you send me a message and then blow me off? This is how they treat PRIME customers!!!I was a huge fan of BEZOS but and I own stock in Amazon but I felt fuzzy when their stock took a hit !!!You don't get to keep customers in this manner and expect them to be your patron!!!", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst picture ever!", "Author": "Sipeish \"SD mamma\"", "ReviewID": "RBM1V7Q9A6JKE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The TV itself is nice, the color however is horrible!! It seems the reds, and yellows are too prominent and stand out too much. The color, and quality also vary by show and it's freaking annoying! There's a foggy look to the picture that I can't fix even after adjusting the colors, and contrast. I hate that there's not swivel option like there was with my Samsung. I guess I'll be returning it and getting another Samsung tomorrow.
