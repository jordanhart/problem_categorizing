{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great 2D and impressive 3D!", "Author": "Michael Smith", "ReviewID": "R2V55ZKMRWOTEG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this TV and wanted to give my thoughts.  I went in looking for a 2D TV, thinking a 3D TV was out of reach.... fortunately the Thanksgiving sales were getting started, and I got this one for only a couple hundred more than what I had budgeted for a 2D TV. The reviews on this TV in 2D mode were good, so I figured 3D was almost free, and if I didn't like it, nothing lost.The TV is quite attractive itself.... sleek and modern.  It's not sporting the new \"monolithic\" look of the higher end Sonys, but it has a small bezel and won't looked outdated, if that sort of thng is a concern to you.  It comes with a decent stand, and has all the connections you need.  Some of the connections are on the back of the unit, so be advised if you plan to wall mount it.The TV was easy to set up and get running.In 2D, the TV is indeed impressive.  SD pictures are very good, but the HD picture is pretty spectacular.  Bright, crisp, great colors....  beautiful! If you're a videophile, you'll probably want to mess with the settings.  I used some calibration settings a videophile friend recommended, and it does look good, but I'm not the most sensitive person to such issues.Some reviews complain about limited viewing angles.  I did notice some loss of contrast with off-angle viewing, but again, it doesn't really seem to be an issue with me, except at fairly extreme angles, where you can't see the picture anyway.So how's the 3D?  PRETTY DARNED IMPRESSIVE!  I find the 3D very convincing. Unlike some other brands I sampled, I did not detect any crosstalk or ghosting.  I'm really looking froward to seeing content developed with these kind of TV's in mind.  The HX800 includes a 2D to 3D conversion mode which worked better than I expected, but I'll be honest and say this is mainly a gimmick to play with until more genuine 3D content is available.  The glasses work well to block out ambient light, though I found them a tad tight, so I hope Sony makes a pair for goons like me with big heads.  On the bright side, they include adjustment so I can get them to fit on my 8-year-old daughter and I don't have to spring for the kid's model.The sound is only acceptable for TV speakers, but most people getting this TV will be using it with an external sound system, so no big deal.  The included speakers are certainly OK for short term use, or in a small room where a home theatre set-up isn't practical.  I wound up using Sony's CT150 sound bar system and I'm very happy with that.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "You can't go wrong!", "Author": "K. Struck", "ReviewID": "R1Y4JCP99V6W0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this unit a couple days ago.  First, setup was a breeze, menu driven and easy to follow.  Took less than 5 minutes, including internet connectivity.  If you have a Netflix account, the setup was also super easy.  Follow the on screen instructions, register your set at Netflix and within seconds, your ready to stream.  Your Qeue is onscreen and streaming starts quickly.  Impressive list of other internet based video sites as well.  Not to mention streaming music and pictures from the more popular photo sharing sites.  I should mention that the set is connected hardwired to a router in my living room so I cannot comment on the wireless setup yet.I connected my set to a Dish Network 922 VIP HD reciever and I have to say, the picture is excellent - maybe not perfect, but darn close. Colors are accurate, bright and the picture is sharp and smooth. 240 Hz makes a huge difference from 120 HZ or 60 Hz.  You will be impressed.Remote is simple and comfortable in your hand.  The menu's are quick, responsive and easy to follow.  Little need for the manual.Good number of inputs for your sat/cable receiver, home theater, blue ray player and game system.  Xbox looks amazing on this thing and I am sure a Playstation looks just as good.3D - I did not purchase the 3D glasses and emitter, and I really wish Sony included them.  That is my only complaint.  I did try out the 3D functionality in the store watching a ESPN football game.  While the 3D was fun and far better than I ever remember it being, with so little content out there now, I figured I would wait a while.If you are looking for a entry level, 3D ready, quality LED-LCD TV, you cannot go wrong with the HX800.

Though like many i bought a sony bravia 40' 2 years ago, i always wanted to get a big screen to change the 42\" westington house i had from 4 years ago. My finance and i went to sony style store just to check it out and it only took us 5 minutes to decide to get one after watching a few things on the screen in 3D. My finance was complaining about my Gizmo habits so i promised her i'm not buying anything but instead she wanted it more than i did.Now about the TV..WOW the picture quality will blow your mind. Watching 3D with my Comcast HD Box by turn on 3D was more than i expected. Tried a regular blu-ray with 3D and i was like WOW. Played the free games that came with the purchase on PS3, it takes gaming to another level.The only little problem i noticed is when you turn on the 3D it takes about 10 seconds for your eyes to get adjusted to the 3D. I heard a lot about getting headaches and feeling of throwing up but nothing of that sort happen to me nor my finance who wears glasses.I know there is a hugh hole in my pocket now but its worth every line of thread it took out. If you had the money, id recommend you get on, if not then wait for the price to come down and you won't regret it.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "SHARING THE SETTINGS OF THIS GREAT TV", "Author": "E. suarez", "ReviewID": "R2FH0CRE8MEZU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GOT THIS FOR AN AMAZING 1499 PLUS TAX DEAL.

We have had it since the middle of December 2010. Arrived in perfect condition. Set up was simple and connected to our Sony Blu Ray,  5.1 sound, and TIVO HD easily. Note that if you intend to use the 3d you will need to buy a new 3d blu ray, we purchased the Sony BDP-S570. The options for connections are impressive and with 4 HDMI we have everything connected. The remote control is a typical Sony remote designed by some engineer that has no experience living in the real world. But we use a Logitech Harmony remote and it works to control everything. Picture quality is very impressive, and we are glad we compared this to the Samsung and LG units. The screen is not the shiny style offered by Samsung and LG. Although those look a little better at Best Buy in a dark room we live in a loft with lots of light and this Sony has almost no reflection on the screen even in a sunlit room. Also note that this product is made in Mexico if you care about things like that not in China like some of the others. We purchased the Sony 3D starter kit with two glasses and the transmitter separately and the 3D is quite impressive. When the amount of 3D content catches up it will be nice to have this TV. The only issue we had was with the delivery company. Pilot Delivery services delivery scheduling is REALLY bad, and it might make us reconsider buying something like this from Amazon again. They only have online scheduling and they are not flexible at all. And although it may say you will get something on a specific date when you order online from Amazon that is really up to Pilot and they don't live up to what Amazon promises.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia KDL-46NX810", "Author": "S. Lee", "ReviewID": "R2SKJ9RF80KZ79", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this Sony Bravia from a local electronics store a little over a week ago for a very good price. I was looking for a 2D LCD to put over the fireplace in the living room but they had such a good deal on this television I bought it figuring the kids would enjoy the 3D feature.  The television has a very good picture and the internet/media streaming features are great. The LED screen is definitely more efficient and barely gets warm to the the touch after hours of use.I am giving this television 4 out of five stars because the sound quality is poor and the wifi adaptor does not work as described with wireless G routers.These televisions are amazingly thin which cuts down on the space available for the speakers. The sound reminds me of those thin portable IPOD speakers. I am now in the process of installing a surround sound system.Initially the wifi adaptor flawlessly connected to my wireless G network with 4 out of 5 bars signal strength. Then within the first day it began intermittently dropping the connection. When the wifi connection would drop out it would stay out on the television for hours while my laptop was getting 5 out of 5 bars in the same room. I tried everything to resolve this issue including, removing all possible sources of interference, changing the channel on the router, and moving the router closer to the television. I was able to get the television to connect to the G router when it was 24 inches from the television but this is completely unacceptable. The funny thing is like the flip of a switch it would start working again and would continue to work for hours before dropping out. I spent several hours on the phone with Sony support trying to get it working with no luck. I finally contacted the store where I purchased the television and they offered to exchange it. The clerk at the electronics store told me that some of the televisions in the store had been having similar issues and that wireless N seemed to work better with the Sony televisions. I got the new television home from the store and it had the EXACT same issue connecting to my wireless G network. I took a trip to the office supply store and bought a low end wireless 2.4 Ghz N router which also dropped out intermittently. I FINALLY resolved the issue by installing a Belkin N600 dual band wireless router. This router allows devices with wireless N adaptors to connect on the 5 Ghz band instead of 2.4 Ghz. It actually broadcasts two separate networks, one in 2.4 Ghz and the other in 5Ghz. The television finds and connects to the 5 Ghz wireless network without issue. If you buy one of these televisions and plan on using the internal wireless adaptor, go ahead and budget 70 to 100 dollars for a new dual band wireless router.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV - Great Picture - Less than perfect Netflix", "Author": "Alan Kaelble", "ReviewID": "RPH3DIY72RLI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV just before Christmas at American TV, without PS3 bundle (we already had one!). What a great purchase. The picture quality is excellent. Stunning HDTV and blue ray (from PS3). Standard TV from cable box is also very nice. Setup is very easy, and the system updates were straight forward and fast (< 5 minutes)I was dead set on Samsung, but the combination of picture quality and price was too much to pass up.Easy to setup. Our connection is wired, not problems, speed is great.My only 2 negatives are the menu system, and Netflix. The menu system is almost identical to PS3, which is great if you own a PS3. However, the entire concept is less intuitive than other brands. The LG menu system seems to be the most straight forward of any I saw.The Netflix app works fine, but you CAN NOT search for movies or TV shows from the Sony Netflix app. You can only select items from your Netflix \"Instant Que\". That means you have to find what you want to watch on the computer, add it to the instant que, then go watch it on Sony TV. Not a total show stopper, but MUCH worse than Samsung, LG, or even the PS3. All these other devices let you search Netflix right from the TV. I expect (or at least hope) than Sony will update in the near future.Did not get any of the 3D accessories, so can not comment", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture, Nice Menu System", "Author": "Editz", "ReviewID": "R2GDYH24Q9XHIX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the set as part of a bundle that included two 3D glasses, the sync transmitter and a Bluray disc player.  I have yet to explore the 3D functions, but as a basic TV the picture is outstanding.The menu system is very complete and includes an on-board iManual that is much more complete than the slim paper manual that comes with the set.  As others have mentioned, Sony really needs to provide this as a .pdf that can be read on a computer.Only complaint I have at this point is that the Picture In Picture function is a little deceptive.  It only appears to work between one regular input and the D-Sub 15 pin VGA input.  In my opinion you should be able to do PIP between any two sources plugged into the set.  This is how my old Sony KV-27XBR45 used to work.  I'm hoping future driver updates can fix this, but I'm not holding my breath.Speaking of updates, the set can accept new drivers via its internet connection or the USB input.  However, not all USB devices are recognized by the set.  Sony eSupport provides a list of compatible drives and of course they're all Sony models!  This wouldn't fly with a computer.  If the set is USB 2.0/FAT32 compatible then any drive meeting those specs should work.  Stop making me try to buy Sony USB drives.Update:  I've discovered that for some reason my local broadcasters don't transmit the TV Guide Online service, which renders Sony's guide interface worthless.  What's worse is that the set does a poor job displaying the PSIP and EPG data embedded in each station's signal.At best you get the short descriptor of what you're currently watching and the name of the upcoming show. There's no ability to display a multi-hour programming lineup.  There's also no ability to read the current show description on each channel without actually having to tune into it.  Both my old $50 ChannelMaster DTV converter and my mother's cheap Vizio HDTV can do these things.Even if you do tune into each and every channel to read the displays, the information isn't kept when in the channel \"browse\" mode.  Everything other than the channel you're currently on is blank or says \"No Info Available\".  All of the set's cool animated menus and Apple coverflow ripoff displays mean nothing without this most basic function.Update 2/22/11: My local FOX affiliate has decided to carry the TVGOS service, so the menu system on the set now works as intended.  It's quite nice, but without it you still have extremely limited access to traditional PSIP and EPG data.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "M. Philips \"Ezermester\"", "ReviewID": "R34QDTITAXOCWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this TV  for a few weeks now, the picture quality is awesome! Once I turned off all the gimmicky stuff that the TV comes with set up as default settings (Motionflow, Noise Reduction, etc) the picture quality is stunning! I'm a professional colorist in the film industry and have been a filmmaker / photographer/ cinematographer all my life I'm particularly fussy about my image quality on any device. On this TV the blacks can be a little too black sometimes and I haven't been able to adjust this yet to my liking. It either starts to go \"muddy\" (washed out gray) or really strong contrasty black. But the custom settings adjustments are there for one to tinker with forever which is really important to me. Overall a fantastic image on the TV. Playing Blu-Ray DVDs on it at 1080/24P via HDMI is stunning!My only rant is Sony's failure to include a built-in wireless network capability so I can easily connect to my home network. After I dropped 1.5 Gs on this TV I am expected to shell out some more dough for a stupid USB wireless adapter to plug into the TV? That's a bit of a joke! But, it doesn't really bother me that much since my Blue-Ray player is hard-wired into the network and that's what I stream (Netflix) through mostly.The remote isn't the greatest design.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV, Nightmare Mounting: 5 min job took 3hrs!", "Author": "ZenGamer", "ReviewID": "R3SDHBRH4MABVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had an old Computer monitor/TV on a swing-arm wall mount which I wanted to replace with this new 3D Sony Bravia KDL46HX800 LED TV that doubles as a computer screen.  It should have taken five minutes to take the old one off and put the new one up. When the Sony TV arrived, we opened it up to find that it only had screws for attaching the base, and they weren't the same size as the wall mounting screw sockets! How idiotic! We immediately called Sony, and they said they don't do mounting screws.We had to go online (on another computer as my monitor was already off the wall) to find out which screws to use as Sony used some obscure way of referring to them that no hardware store thought they had. (The screws, by the way, are 6mmx16mm flat head screws that any hardware store should have.) Get the screws before the TV arrives!After three hours of calling, searching, and finally finding the right screws, the screen was up! (Oh, and by the way, the mounting holes are on the bottom of this TV, so it mounts much higher than a previous one with centered mounts FYI).Once up and plugged in, however, the screen is beautiful. The contrast must be reduced so you have a smooth not chunky image, but once done it's great.One of the good things about this screen is that it can turn any 3D rendered movie into a 3D picture. It won't leap out of the screen at you, but the depth is definitely there as it was rendered.Also, all games can actually be converted into 3D at the touch of a button! I thought I'd need a new graphics card, but you don't need any computer assistance! It must use information embedded in the image to make your computer game truly 3D. The games look excellent in 3D, and the objects actually appear where and at the depth they should!BTW, it does take about 5 minutes to get used to the 3D effect. As a regular TV, it does a great job, and you may want to turn the mpeg artifact filtering on low or high to help low bandwidth movies and TV smooth out those chunky pixels. It does a good job.This TV would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for my mounting nightmare!", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Research paid off", "Author": "Walt", "ReviewID": "R2SQJDDX3U5PPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a new TV and did extensive research online and comparisons at local stores.  My selection was narrowed down to this TV and the comparable Samsung LN46C750. I have had several Sony and Samsung products and have had good luck with both. I chose Sony mainly because I thought the picture was sharper and I am more interested in the 240hz display than the 3D capability (3D does not work well for me and usually gives me a headache).  Ordered online from Amazon with free shipping and no problems.  Estimate I saved about 400 in prices and taxes compared to local stores.  Set up was very easy and this TV has one of the sharpest pictures I have ever seen.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a 40-46\" TV looking to spend 1k-1200.  The other thing that really sold me was at my local Best buy was that they had 3 TVs set up next to each other with the same video being displayed - alot of sports and side scrolling.  Each TV had a different hz - 60,10, and 240.  I knew there was a big difference between 60 and 120 but the difference between 120 and 240 was equally impressive.  If you are in the market for a TV and keep your TVs for an extended period of time, I would really suggest you spend a little extra and get a 240hz model.PROS:  Picture quality is amazing - My wife had Oh God (a movie I despise) on TV playing from our DVR and I could not stop watching it.  The clarity was almost lifelike.Cons: No built in wireless - Have to buy a 30-40 USB adapter.

I've had this tv for about a month and here's my opinion. HDTV performance is excellent, but you need to make adjustments.  The Sony \"Motionflow\" works to smooth an otherwise jerky picture, but the \"smooth\" default setting looks phony, almost creating a live camcorder feel to a cinematic movie.  Motionflow has advantages if you use the standard or clear 1 setting which lightly enhances the effect.  Another issue is hooking up the old vcr, dvd player, or standard def satellite reciever.  Standard definition sources look only fair on this tv.  I would expect there to be an s-video input to maximize standard def performance, but there's not.  To be fair, standard def performance is an issue with practically every HDTV on the market (on the other end of that, my old crt was a Sony 40\" 1080i hi-def tv and looked great with both standard and HDTV sources).  Store bought dvd's played on a standard dvd player look ok on this tv- just be aware this tv was not designed for standard def sources.

Originally I purchased it from Best Buy, it was incorrectly labeled and I got it for 1299, which was a steal at the time. Also, it came bundled with 3d glasses and the emitter. First of all, do yourself a favor and calibrate the tv when you get it, there are several websites that can help with that. The apps are pretty easy to set up, it does help to have a laptop handy so that you can register the TV with Sony and set everything up. Netflix, youtube and Amazon VOD are cool, but require setup. The Hulu Plus app is great, aside from having to add things to your personal queue in order to see them. Only drawback is that the Google TV features were not included with this, but I have since purchased a Logitech Revue and added that functionality. TV Speakers are adequate for a small room, but if you are putting this in a larger room, you will definitely need an external surround source. The 3d is pretty damn spectacular, and 3d gaming with the PS3 is great. It opens up your eyes to things that you have never seen before. Gran Turismo was a blast, Resistance 3 was incredible with the PS Move gun attachment as well. I also have my PC attached to the TV via HDMI and have no complaints, 1920 x 1080 resolution looks fantastic and the graphics pop off the screen.

My faith was rewarded, I love my television. 3D T.V.'s are different than watching a 3D movie at the theater. Where at theater the movie appears to jump out of the screen, watching the T.V. seems to be more like looking through a window. When coupled with blu-ray the picture is amazing.Like with anything there are a few drawbacks. First, the glasses are expensive. Second, this particular television boasts that it can convert 2D signals into 3D signals...This is a feature I do not use. I tried it on a few other blu-ray movies thinking that it would be at least close to a 3D movie. While it does add a little more depth to the picture it is no where near the quality of actual 3D blu-ray's. Animated movies appear to convert from 2D to 3D better than conventional movies, but still not as good as movies made in 3D... Which brings me to the biggest drawback of a 3D T.V. .... Movie availability... The selection is rather limited and to top it all off the production companies are going with exclusives where some movies will only work with a particular brand of T.V. with that particular brand of blu-ray player. For example, Megamind is only available on Samsung (or maybe Panasonic... I just remember it is one of the ones I don't have.). On top of that, Megamind is only available with the started package with two glasses for about $400.The biggest plus is definetly video games. Gran Turisimo 5 and Call of Duty: Black Ops look particularly amazing in 3D. I was not even that crazy about Call of Duty until I played it in 3D. First Person Shooters enter a whole new realm of realism. The gaming alone was worth the purchase.As for the seller, I would recommend Amazon's video and audio center. When I first got my T.V. and had it going for a week it had lines running down the side of it. I wrote the seller and within a two days they sent me a replacement free of charge. They even paid for shipping for me to return the defective unit.

The 1080P combined with the 24p True Cinema and 240Hz motionflow pro makes fast moving action scenes in movies look even better & real.Here are what I like about the TV:-Picture - The Picture is perfect, crispy, sharp & deep colors.Sound - The sound on set is excellent than expected.Internet Content- It has variety internet content sources like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Video on demand etc.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fine as HDTV. Firmware update & Customer Disservice is nightmare", "Author": "W. J. Jennings \"Little Wing\"", "ReviewID": "RGT8KJWMCISEW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received this item on Dec 5 2010.  It shipped with a firmware version already 5 iterations old.  The \"Automatic Update\" feature is a joke. It requires your television to remain, unused and unwatched for 24-36 hours in \"standby\" mode for the \"automatic update\" process to complete....and that's with a direct, broadband ethernet hook up direct from router to the TV.  Alternately, they will direct you to the support website where you will need to use a \"compatible\" USB drive, reformatted to the FAT32 standard (which means, erased and reformatted).  I have maybe three dozen various USB flash drives and tried 20 of them, erased, reformatted, and the television would not recognize any of them (including several that were listed on the website as \"known to be compatible\").  The third option is for Sony to snail mail you a preformatted USB drive with the needed software/firmware update.  This will take 7-14 BUSINESS days....2-3 weeks.Until this Internet Ready TV will be able to view Netflix streaming and 80% of its other Internet features, it has to have this \"necessary update to its firmware\".  So, essentially, we will have a new $1,000 plus \"Internet Ready!\" television, purchased for the holidays, that can't do anything more than our old TV could by getting Netflix in the mail.Sony's customer \"support\" is a joke, too.  You get pleasant people who will repeat the same block of text in their script books again and again and again, then put you into the ether-hold purgatory, then another person will come on line and read the same scripted paragraph about \"immediately\" shipping you a flash drive in \"7-14 business days!!!\"  Really.  How about sending you flash drive via UPS or USPS Priority or overnight mail?  Doesn't a $1300 purchase get you at least this much of a response?  Gee, LL Bean, Zappos, and lebenty zillion other companies seem to grasp the concept of customer service and how a quick response might be connected to \"revenue stream.\"Oh, and \"software update/upgrade issues\" are NOT covered by your service warranty, either.So, if you are hoping to have an HDTV to stream internet video or use other net features that work, work consistently, and function as advertised, I suggest looking elsewhere.Sony, at least at one time, stood for quality at this type of price point and once, in a far away universe at a long ago time, they used to stand behind their products.Amazingly rigid, unhelpful and bordering on rude customer service...who could have said, \"Yes, we're sorry for your disappointment...we will send you a preformatted USB drive via USPS Priority Mail that will arrive within 3-5 business days.\"That would cost them no more than $6 and would have bought a great deal of customer good will.  Instead, you get a lecture about policy and procedure and how nobody at any one Sony Customer Call Center has the authority to stray from the provided script.Look elsewhere.

I bought this Tv the week it came out (I worked for Best Buy at the time) and the deal going on was the buyer got a free PS3 and 3D stater kit (receiver and glasses).  To this day, my picture is better than almost any other Tv out there.  The 240Hz refresh rate keeps the picture crisp even during fast pace scenes, and the 1080p looks incredible with a quality Bluray player (I don't know if movies are even shot in 1080p but the picture looks like it pops out at you even in 2D mode).  The first Bluray I played on this Tv was the new Star Trek, I was hooked after that.  As for 3D, it's awesome.  The only downfall with the 3D is the glasses the viewer must wear.  They're a little uncomfortable and I've had to replace the batteries twice, so about once a year (not too bad but I don't use them often).  As for the sound, I can't complain, in my living room it sounds great, I've been thinking of getting a sound bar but not due to the sound not being up to par on the Tv itself.  Anyone looking for a quality LED Tv should look no further than the Sony HX series.  I love it, I no longer work for BB but I doubt anything on the market would beat this in the price range this Tv is now in (seeing as it is a few years old).  Highly recommend, though I would definitely get from a bricks and mortar store, not online (I bought the protection service for it for 4 years to be on the safe side but have yet to need it).

However, for a movie experience you need a surround sound system.  Also, it takes a little while to turn on the TV - around 8 seconds before you can watch the TV.  To use the special features on the remote it takes longer before the tv is ready, but not more than 30 seconds.OverallI really like this tv.  The picture is amazing, and the price is good for a tv of 240hz led quality.  The view at an angle is not bad.  The power saving feature is nice.  So is the optional upgrade to 3D (which I did not do.)  I would buy this TV again.1/28/13 UpdateI have owned this tv for a couple of years now.  Still like it, but notice a few concerns:1.  The sound and picture sometimes does not sync.  You have to flip to another channel and come back to the channel you want to watch ever so often.2.  The TV takes around 10 seconds to warm up before turning on, and then takes about 1 minute before you can change channels.3.  The TV, infrequently, will \"Churp\" after being on for awhile.  It might do it 2-3 times, and then turn itself off, and then come back on.  I see it most when I watch channel 32.1.
