{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect Picture - Sound - Features", "Author": "Richard W.", "ReviewID": "R1WIY215XHAXZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good TV if you do not want 3D and spending your money on an expensive model.  This is a reasonable priced TV that delivers perfect picture in 1080i on digital television and a crystal clear picture with it.  I will cut to the chase and say I looked at a lot of TV's and did my research for you and the other reviews may go into more detail but here are the key points.1) I have Wi-Fi at home with a router and I set up with a LAN wire from my router to TV and selected wired in setup and it worked as the wireless setup button said failed but using a LAN wire to TV worked perfectly so select wired and you will have no problems.2) Download the media connect to be able to use your computer.  Mine showed 9 downloads but they are all the same and you only need to save one and I guess the rest are for other applications as they are all the same as I found out.  Once you have it downloaded you will have to go to the file and run it to get the icon and application on your computer.  Note that you will most likely have to change your screen resolution to watch your computer on the TV as they are different levels but again everything works seamlessly.3) Headphones have a bonus features I did not see but it is perfect.  The TV and headphones have separate volume controls and are independent of each other.  This means one person can listen to the TV at their own volume while another person can wear the headphones and hear the TV at their own level.  The TV sound still works while the headphones are plugged in is a great bonus feature I did not expect.4) Go to Philips and download the full version of the manual as it is more complete than the one in the box.5) You can go into the settings and upgrade the picture options to tweak it so the picture is even sharper and crystal clear to a higher degree.6) The picture is crystal clear & sharp and sound is perfect plus DVD's and Blu-ray movies are extremely sharp and every detail stands out.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT SO SMART", "Author": "Fred J.

At the time I didn't think that there was any correlation so I continued to use it with my newly purchased Mac Mini. Even though I didn't have an overheating problem with the MAC, I could never get the pixel ratio right even after being on the phone with Philips who just blamed my new computer as being the problem. Next, I went to setup the internet and it wouldn't work no matter what I tried. I used the Ethernet Plug-in as well as 3 different Wi-Fi's to get it to work. I called Philips and they said I could warrantee out the product and they would send me a new one. I was okay with that until I heard that it would take 2-3 months for me to send my TV in, them to process it, and then for them to send me one back out. I live in Arizona and this TV is going to Texas, it's not going half-way around the world. I argued with them that I needed my screen in order to do my homework and even see anything on my Mac Mini. After about 20 minutes being on the phone with the supervisor he agreed to send me one if I put a $1 hold on my card. I was leery but still willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. 2 weeks later I get the replacement TV. The first thing that I noticed is that the box was barely taped together. A plastic bag seemed more stable than this box! As I opened it I realized they sent me a re-manufacted TV that was all scratched. The best part was that they sent me out a TV that didn't even have internet capabilities which was the reason why I called in the first place. I was not happy so I called Philips and they said they send re-maufactered TV's to be \"green.\" Honestly, being a college kid if I wanted to save money I would have found a re-manufactered or used one on Amazon or Newegg. I could have saved $40! I had the most rude tech on the phone and I asked for the supervisor multiple times before she was willing to follow what I had asked. The supervisor got on the phone and said \"we are sorry but I cannot be responsible for either people.\" WTF what kind of business is this?! I ultimately just returned the TV and got a Vizio. The place where I bought the TV said that Philips TV's are worthless and they are known to blow out computer graphics cards using the HDMI because they draw too many amps. So this TV hasnt only cost me time but a newer computer.My warning to you is buy a reputable source. DO NOT BUY THIS!!", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lots of promise, but major faults :(", "Author": "ChrisL", "ReviewID": "R1EONTHJ580HU3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Beautiful design on this TV. The picture is exceptional and so is the sound. The integrated Netflix (with its own button on the remote) is really cool, but that's where the problems begin. First, the volume display normally seen when using the HDMI input is not shown in Netflix mode at all. Functionality like closed captions is completely separate too, although I can see how that isn't easy to do. The volume part makes no sense to me.Next, there is a dead pixel in this unit. I've bought 4 HD TVs over the last couple of years and never had a dead pixel. I'll be exchanging this tomorrow (bought at Walmart for $248) to see if this is a recurring problem.Features built in to play video from Plex and other media center servers are extremely limited in what formats are playable. If my xbox can play it, it's shocking that this TV can't.Finally, the neatest feature of the TV, wireless connect, an app that mirrors your Mac or PC (I have Macs) to the TV lags heavily. Maybe 10 or more seconds. That's pretty bad, although it may be handy to be able to watch streamed movies and TV shows on a big (29\") screen using my old MacBook as the server. I haven't installed the software there yet; however, if my newer 27\" iMac lags, I suspect it will be far worse with my 2008 MacBook.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$278.99", "Features": "Connect a PC or MAC to a TV wirelessly with WirelessConnect\nOne button access to wireless NetTV services on your TV\nBrilliant LED images with low power consumption\nEnjoy rich sound and clear dialog with SRS TruSurround HD\nSmart Cloud for automatic updates to content", "Name": "Philips 29PFL4908/F7 29-Inch 60Hz LED HDTV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/316yIHSRNrL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BE2KI1Y"}}
