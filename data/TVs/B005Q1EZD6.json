Was cheapest price for 1080p, good size for up close gaming, and fit perfectly on my desk! Now I get to play all my games in HD, and if necessary can hook it up to my computer for dual monitor action. The TV has actually decent sound for the size- I find myself just shelving my headphones most of the time due to comfortability.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Mariabx485", "ReviewID": "R3TOW3TLSF6EMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MY SON LOVES HOW CLEAR THE PICTURE IS AND ESPECIALLY ON HIS CONSOLES.

Well, It is working.  But a bright green vertical line has formed on the screen about a month in to use.  Of course, the box and everything had been tossed.  I didn't even check on if I could return it or not as life became a bit hectic.  The channels will often freeze on me as well.  The sound, picture quality, ease of use ... that all is great but I would have spent some more money if I had known this green line would show up.  I can still watch TV and doesn't affect the actual quality of the picture.  Just annoying.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Westinghouse does not stand by product.", "Author": "scoob", "ReviewID": "RZTOUFDYGOLK7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought a tv on Black Friday from Westinghouse.
