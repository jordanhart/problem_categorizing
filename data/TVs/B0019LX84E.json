Florczak", "ReviewID": "R5BN4B7VWZS30", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading reviews, I recently purchased the 40\" Sony XBR4 as it's considered one of the best LCD's on the market.  But after 10 days of continuing to adjust and tinker with the settings on the Sony, I concluded the color was just too garish and sensitive. I even had a technician come out to look at the set, and he agreed the color quality on the Sony was inconsistent at best.Enter the new LG 42LG70 which I purchased after returning the overrated Sony XBR4.The LG42LG70 has a great picture...very natural colors. The set reproduces vibrant colors, but not in the garish, you need sunglasses to view it, way that the Sony did.  In addition, the LG 42LG70 has some terrific settings such as \"Fresh Color\" which accentuates the green of playing fields when watching sports such as baseball (it does so without oversaturating other colors at the same time).Furthermore, the LG 42LG70 is a good looking set! Thin, impressive black bezel, etc...  I have a 42\" Sharp Aquos in my den, but have to admit I like the picture quality better on the brand new LG 42LG70.I highly recommend this LCD to anyone in the market for a quality television!  (Plus, it costs less than the disappointing Sony XBR4!).", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent (after a few tweaks)", "Author": "WDH", "ReviewID": "R3PSCFCO6SH5TI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing HDTV and the 120 Hz keeps fast moving images clean and smooth.  It's mind blowing how bright and clear blu-ray is on this set.  Watching BBC's Planet Earth felt like we were standing right there.  The only thing you need to do when watching films, however, is to turn OFF the TrueMotion feature.  It makes Sports, News, and Documentaries look excellent, but it will make your films look like they were shot on video!Turning off TrueMotion while watching movies results in high-def perfection.More than enough HDMI inputs, fast screen refresh rate, deep blacks, easy picture customization, and overall great value for all these features.

I had the decision down to the Samsung \"Touch of Red,\" LG Scarlett (LG60) and this 42LG70.  The Samsung seemed nice, but I felt it was overpriced.  It had half the features the LGs have.  The only thing \"special\" about the Samsung was that it had a hard drive.  Personally I don't need a hard drive on my TV.  I like the Scarlet (42LG60), but I wasn't a fan of the big circle in the middle.  It's style and design seemed a little odd and old fashioned to me.  Then there it was, the 42LG70!  Same exact features as the Scarlet, but the design is much more modern (and $450 cheaper)!  The finish is very sleek and shiny.  You can see your face in it (it comes with a super cool, high speed micro fiber cloth to wipe off finger prints and smudges and it works really well)!  I got it home and hooked it up and the picture was unreal.  I watched an episode of Prison Break in HD and was blown away.  My wife made the comment that the picture was so good, you could see the actors pores and imperfections lol.  The funny thing is, she usually can't tell the difference between HD and SD.  This TV has opened her eyes (we had a 32LG40 from three years ago)!Like someone already mentioned, the TruMotion is an excellent feature while watching most programming, but for certain HD programming and every movie I have tried to watch,  its better to turn the TruMotion off.  The problem I noticed is that it seems you are watching everything in a x2 FF mode.  Turned the TruMotion off and the speed went back to normal without any loss of picture quality.This TV is absolutely amazing and you cannot beat the price!  Sony is overrated and expensive and Samsung is starting to get that way too.  Bottom line:  you can't go wrong purchasing this LCD TV!", "Date": "September 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "awesome first TV", "Author": "V.

I have compared them all, and w/o spending 3k or 4k on a super high end TV, this is an excellent purchase. This is by no means at the low end of the spectrum, and it's color intensity and smoothness is unparalleled in its class. The TruMotion 120Hz is definitely amazing, but personally I don't think it should be used for live-action movies such as batman, spiderman, pirates, etc. For all digital movies, animated movies (wall-E, etc), TV and sports, I think the TruMotion is ideal.Either way, you can turn it on/off, so it's no big issue. I haven't found any dead pixels, and amazon sent it straight to my house earlier than expected. However, when watching blu ray movies, the sound must be cranked up way high, unless you have a sound system. (small issue)Long story short, if you are in the market for a mid-economy LCD purchase, this is w/o a doubt, the ideal solution.

They also refused to do anything about the bezel and labeled it as a 'cosmetic' defect and would not cover it under warranty.  For what they charge for these things you would think you were getting a quality product.  I expect what I buy new to resemble new condition.

(Maybe there is something wrong with my laptop, but I don't think so, I have hooked it up to multiple projectors for work presentations, and there has never been any issues.)Another complaint is the sound.  When there is background noise I have to turn the volume up to 60-70 (out of 100) and it is still not very loud.The final issue is using the 120Hz on the TV, which is done by changing the \"True Motion\" option to \"High.\"  All Blu-Ray movies look a bit off, it's like it changes the movies to live High Def TV shows.  It makes things so crisp and clear, that a movie such as Transformers that had incredible special effects, so much that they actually looked real in the theater, look like animated objects on a green screen.  This is not a huge issue, you just turn the True Motion off, but it makes me feel like I wasted money paying more to get an LCD with 120Hz.  It does, however, make video games on the PS3 platform look better.

I had a tight tight budget for my new LCD, this is very very good LCD for the decent price.The truemotion 120Hz feature is good for Games and Sports,Keep off if you watch regular shows.However I would like to have quicker access to this feature through a button on the remote,it can get old going through a very nicely made menu.The menu is smooth and easy to follow,very visual...The remote is thin and doesn't have tons of buttons or any stupid wheels...ALL in ALL TV is great, Picture is excellent, Price is Excellent,Set up is Easy,and hope i dont have to tell you how customer support is.Not a Tv to pass on for any reason i was going into a samsung but then saw this one and changed my mind very quickly.I would recommend this to anyone.Shipping was scary but it got here fine and im happy.Amazon has been easy to deal with now i see if my service plan is coming.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "LG 42\" LCD", "Author": "P.

The price was lower than the other big name tvs.  This tv is phenomanal.  Really.  We've been researching LCD tvs since the beginning of November.  Relatives have a 40\" Samsung.  Theirs is beautiful (picture, sound)...but THIS LG...there's no comparison. It was easy to hook up the HDMI 1.3 2m cable. Amazon techs suggested we purchase the HDTV Hook-up Kit from Wire Logic.  2-HDMI 1.3 cables (you only need one) plus extra cables (for DVD, etc), a Clean Screen mist spray and microfiber mitt...all for $45.  The clarity, colors, sound, ease of menu are fantastic.  The people who deliver for Amazon are top notch.  By the way, the tv comes with a CD-ROM that shows everything about this tv...even more than the manual.  We ordered it Jan. 2.  The estimated date of delivery was Jan. 12.  However, the company received it, called us on January 6th and delivered it Jan 7th.  We don't really care what future technology LG comes up with...ya can't get any better than this.

It was on sale for $949 and with tax beat all on-line retailers.  I did the research and viewed the screens in stores.  I live in a small RV and am limited on space and have lots of window light.  The Panasonic plasma was my 1st choice but the plasma is a fragile set as you can not lay them down, they aren't supposed to travel over 5,000' in elevation and I was also concerned with vibration.  So I was considering the Sony 40\" and the Samsung 40\" but the reviews and specs of the LG along with the 2\" of gained viewing space with a fine matte screen attracted me.  I also saw the LG 42\" in several 4 and 5 star hotels!  They prefer LG because of reliability.  I have been watching my old VHS movies from a Sony dual player directly connected to the LG via 3 wire component harness.  LG sound is very good!  I have read many complaints about the LCD sets having poor sound, well the LG is great!  Also I have a Sony 1080i upscale DVD player to watch my standard DVD movies.  They look great on this set.  Yesterday I installed my new Sony S-350 Blu Ray player and watched \"The Dark Knight.\"  WOW.  It is like better than the theater!  I could not believe it, even the sound is terrific.  Tonight I want to watch a standard DVD movie because this player up scales to 1080P and the reviews indicate standard movies will look as good as a blu ray.  I will check this out!  Believe me when I tell you there is NOTHING out there that beats the 42LG70's performance with an excellent matte screen with no reflection! By the way, I am using CAT-2 HDMI cables from the Blu Ray player to the Denon Receiver and from there to the LG.  From AMZN seller for under $10 each and that allows 100% transfer of all Blu Ray transfer data!

I talked & talked about it to her, then brought her in to Best Buy to see it and she said \"yea, let's get it\".  Right now at BB it comes with an XBOX360 and Geek Squad service (meh) all for 1299! That's an unbelievable price, especially with 3 yr 0% financing.We came home and took our 30\" CRT Sony HDTV (720p / 1080i) TV down and put up the new LG.  The image quality is OUT OF THIS WORLD! We watched an episode of the Office on our U-Verse DVR with the TruMotion turned on.  It looked like we were watching 1080p instead of 1080i.  The depth and clarity during movement was so realistic it felt like we were there in Scranton PA.We also tried to watch some select scenes from The Dark Knight and immediately I paused it and turned on the 24p (Cinema mode) and turned OFF the TruMotion per the suggestion of everyone here.  It made a world of difference, the opening scene where the masked robbers are zip lining onto the roof involves a zoom into the Chicago skyline.  With TruMotion on it was jittery and jumpy on the vertical lines.  Once it was off it was 100% perfect. I then hooked up my new XBOX360 directly into the component in on the back and again, flawless picture.The red, metallic border on the sides and top of the TV was a VERY nice touch and my wife loved it. The control buttons on the right side of the TV are touch sensors.  If you put your finger over the volume up area (without pushing) it turns up the volume. That was a feature I wasn't even aware of when we purchased it.Overall, this is an excellent 1080p TV and right now one of the best for the price.

I ultimately decided on this TV based on the specs, good reviews and price.First, you can't go wrong with buying this on Amazon.  They had the best price and shipped it free to my front door.  This thing would have never fit in my car. :)Second, even though assembling the base was a little tricky (I\"ll get to that), the set-up couldn't have been easier.  I do not subscribe to TV so I didn't have to worry about that part.  I had purchased an LG Blu-ray player in anticipation of buying my new TV.  I hooked the Blu-ray player up to my (older) surround sound, connected the player to the TV with an HDMI cable (Not included, if you get a good price offer on this when buying your TV take it.  They're $30 at Wally World) and then I was off an running.  The TV recognized the player right away and the menu came up.As I mentioned, the base assembly was tricky.  It's not rocket science but the screws don't turn easily and if they are the slightest bit loose your TV will lean.  I used some top-quality grease that I usually use on bike parts on the screws.  That helped but they were still very hard to snug up.Finally, and most importantly, this TV has the most amazing picture.  Even on non-Blu-ray discs the picture is shockingly clear and vivid.  Every time I watch something I am simply amazed at how beautiful the picture is.  The colors are bright and true.  The blacks and dark colors are distinguished.  It is worth every penny.  As previous reviewers have noted, turn off the Tru-Motion when watching movies through the very easy to navigate menu, which is another plus.  The menu is easy to find and intuitive.  I haven't changed much since I initally set up the TV but I know that if I want to change something I won't need to pull out my manual.  Each option is easy to find in the menu.If you are having doubts or concerns about buying this TV let me help you put them to rest.  I put in hour upon hour researching specs and reading reviews and I can happily report that this TV has not let me down in any way.  I don't think you will find a better TV for the price.

The picture mode setting has an \"intelligent sensor\" that has an annoying pop up whenever lighting conditions change so I turn it off.  The Tru Motion feature is amazing but best turned to low or off when watching some HD.  The contrast is better than any other TV I looked at and the black levels are as deep as a good plasma.

If they gave it a bad review - then they are missing the key: TURN OFF THE TRUMOTION.TruMotion is great for documentaries, sports, news, etc... but when you are watching The Dark Knight on Blu-Ray... it makes the movement so realistic that you feel like you are watching a camcorder.Positives:The one thing that I haven't seen anyone else write about is the menu system and setup. PLUG AND PLAY! Perfect picture right out of the box... the only setting that you need to ever adjust is the \"TruMotion\" which is VERY easy to find since LG has made probably the easiest to use menu system I have ever seen on a TV.Picture Quality:Top Notch. While they are coming out with a 480hz TV this year (as seen at CES), my bet is that your not going to physically be able to see the difference.An example of how good the picture quality is:We watch \"Good Luck Chuck\" on BluRay when we got the TV. After watching it my wife made the comment \"I LOVE this TV\", when I inquired as to why, she said \"Jessica Alba doesn't have as good of skin as me! I feel so good about myself\".

The setup was easy and the picture quality was average to poor due to my having the standard Direct-TV service. I ordered the Direct TV HD upgrade receiver and their technicion installed it two days after I ordered and was he was very good/knowledgeable. The HD channels on my new LG looked perfect in color and clarity. This is the way TV should be. One problem with Direct TV in Central Virginia is they do not give you the local channels in HD. So after all my efforts, I had to watch this years Superbowl on Fox in standard digital and the picture was poor. I contacted Direct TV and they said the local channels in my area were not available in HD even thought we can see the HD symbol on all of them. I contacted the local channels and they said Direct TV refuses to connect to their HD signal. This must be some kind of finacial decision where Direct TV deems our market not worthy of the investment but they claim that 88% of their customers get local channels in HD. I asked Direct TV why we were being charged the same as their customers getting local HD when we did not. They did not reply. The solution here is to buy an outdoor HDTV antenna. I just installed mine this weekend and I now get all local channels in HD along with 20 other \"FREE\" channels. The cable and satelite companies are gouging us with high prices and package deals that encourage you to spend more. If our TV stations continue to add HD free service, the cable/satelite companies may find themselve without customers. I gave the 42LG70 a rating of 4 due to the internal speakers causing vibration and ratling in surround mode.", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Finally gave up 18 year old CRT television", "Author": "Michael H.

I had been following the Sony and Samsung and was about to go Sony, but took a closer look at the LG.It certainly had more features and the picture quality seemed to stand out. Price was right as well. I bought a $65.00 upgrading DVD player and use component wiring and get an amazing picture. I don't have an HDMI/1080p receiver (yet), so the picture is grainy via regular TV programming, depending on the channel and type of program (my wife pointed this out to me the first day I plugged it in.).We did watch \"Leatherheads\" on Video on Demand last night via our cable service and I was impressed with the picture quality again. This is through the simple yellow video cable from a 18 y/o Pioneer reeiver! Movie was unfortunately 'modified to fit the screen' via Bresnan cable -D'Ho!So far, very happy with this unit!Mike", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "42LG70: Best Television for The Price Guaranteed!!!!!!", "Author": "Nicholas A.
