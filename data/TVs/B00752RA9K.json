Sears had the best price for this size tv after I checked around. I was impressed with the service I got there as well. Panasonic is a quality name and is tops for trouble free manufacturers for tv's, and this one has a great picture for my needs. Since I got an HDTV cable box the image is crystal clear. I also think the sound quality is great. It's not a fancy tv with LED or 120MHz, or wifi capabilty, but those tv's cost a lot more. But for a non-LED this screen is thin. As for 60MHZ vs. 120, you may notice a difference, but I don't think it's worth paying extra to avoid the occasional jitter. If you want streaming you are better of with getting another device for this such as a PS3. Many reviewers with wifi capable tv's built in complain they don't work well or need adapters anyway. For my needs this tv is first class. I love Amazon, but they don't always have the best price.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "great TV!!!", "Author": "K.

But I was confident it's a good TV when I was comparing with another TVs (Samsung, Sony, LG) in the store. The color is so natural, screen isn't too bright which you could watch for a long time and won't feel tired. I also worried about the 60Hz, but I am so happy now after watching all kinds of sports including hockey, football, soccer without notice any motion blur. Sales person always tell you to go for 120Hz but not this one. Setting is easy, color is right on using the default setting. Volume is loud even in a living room - I use only one third of the max.

Got this from Sears today for $500. The picture is great for cable TV. You would not notice the 60MHz blurs unless someone told you to look for them.  No problems at all with the viewing angle.  It does not have internet access but if you have PS3 or a Roku, you're all set.

After several months of research, we purchased a Samsung LED but after a few days, we hated it and returned it.  Back to the drawing board.  We wanted to stick with Panasonic and preferably plasma but unfortunately, a good 90% of 2012 models of all televisions only come with 2 HDMI now (why, we don't understand).  We need 4 HMDI ports! We've tried 3 different HDMI switch boxes and just don't like that route.Recently, we came across this television (which has 3 HDMI) and thought, what the heck, let's give it a try.  Wow!! Are we ever impressed! The visual quality is perfect for us, the menu is simple, no Smart TV features (which we don't need or want).  This is a very simple but fantastic model.My first beef was how thick it is but at the same time, it's so light in weight.  The only con I have to complain about is the sound quality...not the best but in combination with our surround system, it works.If you want a Smart TV or super thin model, keep looking but if you're on a budget and want something fantastic for it's price range, pick this TV up!!", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gaming and Sports", "Author": "Slander", "ReviewID": "RMUS6Q95EZB9F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't pay a monthly cable/satellite bill, and stream all my media content to the tv through an xbox and tablet. Shopping for tv's I was very impressed with Panasonic's LCD HD picture but most of their television had high end features that were superfluous, like integrated wifi and apps, and were too expensive. Finding this quality of a picture, from a quality manufacture, at 42\" of LCD tv, for $500.00 is good deal. After a couple weeks of gaming, watching the Kings, and now the NBA finals, I love the picture! Sports and gaming really look nice on this tv.My only complaint, probably should be taken with a grain of salt as I am a musician and serious music aficionado, is the sound quality is unimpressive and lacks bass. I've been turning the volume up quite a bit up to hear the commentary over the crowd noise. The bass seems thin when streaming music or movies, but then again this was only $500.00 tv and its not intended to have stand-alone quality sound.After upgrading with a refurb Sharp SB600 sound bar and woofer the sound issue is gone.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mediocre TV, step down from 2011 models", "Author": "Smart Shopper CA", "ReviewID": "R2MTPJ5ICZXPA8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Given positive experiences with the 2011 Panasonic models, I chose this budget 42\" model. I'm not that impressed with it to be honest.2011 models had IPS panel screens which offer deep blacks, uniform image quality, and excellent viewing angles. This TV however doesn't have these advantages. Black looks gray or even green tinged at times, and the problem is worse as you move to the sides. If you look at a solid background you can see the edges of the screen having brighter areas than the center.In HD mode the picture is very good but for simple digital and analog channels the picture is very grainy. I spent quite a bit of time adjusting settings to get a satisfactory picture. The remote it comes with is very poor and some buttons were unresponsive right out of the box.Given the price, it was an ok buy, but with Sony and Samsung models dropping in price, spend an extra $50-100 and get a much nicer TV. From the reviews I've seen, Panasonic missed the mark this year with this model as well as the LED screens, probably to save cost.

Good picture, simple to configure. My biggest gripe is there is only ONE output from the TV - digital audio output.  No HDMI ARC. No optical. Not even RCA! So, if you are going to hook this up to an external sound system you better make sure it takes digital audio or buy some sort of converter. I find it ridiculous that a TV currently still in production does not have HDMI ARC or optical!What makes this even more frustrating is that I bought a Panasonic Viera sound system (Panasonic SC-BTT195) for the sole purpose of making sure they work together. Guess what? The Panasonic SC-BTT195 only takes RCA, optical and HDMI ARC - NOT digital audio. I think it is almost criminal that two products made by the same company in the same product line by design cannot work together. I have a kludge in place but will need to order a digital audio -> optical converter. Hope I don't lose anything in the process.So, would I buy this TV again?

We recieved the new unit and experienced the same issue - unit would not power on with a DB-15 VGA connector attached.  Same cycle worked (unplug, fully power off, power on, wait for no signal message, attach connector).  Powered off unit, then would not power on again.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Turns off by itself, poor color accuracy", "Author": "LinuxFancy", "ReviewID": "REHFO57KNK0JM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE 2:  We returned the replacement unit as well.  The color balance was poor and hours of adjustment and comparing to our old TV could never get it to a point where we were happy with it.  The blacks were greenish or brownish, and whenever we got one color looking OK, the others would be skewed.  Skin tones never looked good either.It's too bad - all we want is a nice-looking television without 3D or wifi or apps.UPDATE 1, 9/24/2012:We called Panasonic, but that was pretty useless.  The customer support was really bad - they barely seemed to be paying attention, asked the same questions repeatedly, and kept getting confused about what model we had.  Their only suggestion to improve the picture was very limited (turn down the contrast and turn up the brightness - which we had already done).  As for the \"turning off\" issue, they said they had never heard of that problem, and suggested I take it to an authorized repair shop.  Well, it won't fit in my car, and they don't offer on site repair for TVs less than 47\" - so we returned to Amazon for a replacement.  The color seems slightly better on this one, but still not quite right.  We are still playing with it.  The new unit has turned off by itself once so far (in about 4 days - today was the first time).  If the issue recurs, or we can't get the colors set to our satisfaction, we will return it and try another model.  Still love Amazon's support!ORIGINAL REVIEW:Got the TV yesterday.  No issues with the initial setup, spent some time getting it hooked up with our XBOX and Mac Mini.  We get a lousy signal in my house so we didn't bother testing the \"TV\" part of it.  It looks fine, but the colors are different from our last TV.  We ended up turning the contrast down and that seemed a bit better.But after a few hours, the TV just turned itself off.  No flashing lights, no nothing - right in the middle of doing something on the computer.  It turned right back on again when we hit the power button on the remote.Today, same thing - this time we were using the XBOX, and it just turned off.  This was again after a few hours of use (browsing online, watching a movie on Netflix).  Again, no lights, and it turned right back on once we hit the power.This TV does have some \"Eco\" settings - by default, it will turn itself off after 10 minutes of \"no signal\".  This works fine, and it pops up a warning in the corner about 3 minutes before it shuts off.  There is also an option to turn off after 3 hours without a key press, but the default behavior is \"Stay on\".  I turned off the 10 minute option also - just in case there is a bug with this feature - and will test again tomorrow.Haven't decided yet if we will try to engage Panasonic for support, or just send it back to Amazon.  It would be a good deal if the TV just worked.
