I've owned several Magnavox TVs over the years & have never gotten a bad one. They may not be the best TVs I've ever owned compared to my Samsungs, Toshibas, Sonys, etc., but they've always been pretty good TVs for the price. Case in point: a week ago I found myself having to buy 5 new TVs in one day of various sizes. I bought 3 Magnavoxes, 1 Element & 1 Sanyo. The Sanyo is OK, the Element is horrible. The Magnavoxes are good.This reviewed 19-inch Magnavox that I purchased from Amazon for a kitchen is a gem compared to the 19-inch Element I bought for the other kitchen only because it was clearance-priced at Target for $95. Where the Element's picture is washed out unless one views it \"dead-on\" in front of the screen, the Magnavox is bright with deep, rich color & good contrast from multiple viewing angles. The audio on the Magnavox also shames the Element.As it stands now, I will always be a fan of Magnavox as a good value for the money & would recommend it to anyone not wanting or unable to spend much more on \"high-end\" brands.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little TV", "Author": "MJF", "ReviewID": "RR5R0RO8AST3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Actually it doesn't seem so small.

I have a very small indoor HDTV antenna attached to the set, and it works just great.) The resolution is excellent, and the sound is very nice; not tinny-sounding or too loud or too soft.  Just perfect.  All that said, I was disappointed in the tiny plastic stand that's bundled with this tv.  The plastic stand is quite small, given the size and weight of the tv set, and the screws that secure the tv to the stand are so short they do not provide a secure base on which to stand the tv, thereby leaving the tv wobbling back and forth on the stand...so, you have to be very careful not to jar the tv for fear of knocking it off the stand, and having it tumble to the floor.
