{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best TV of anyone I know", "Author": "Jason S", "ReviewID": "R1A7D2LYAYQF26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was initially skeptical about purchasing this TV from Sam's Club because they were only selling 9 of them - and not removing any from the boxes to display.  In other words, I bought this TV on blind faith and the strong recommendation from the store associate.  And I'm extremely glad I took his advice.The picture on this TV is brilliant in High Def.  It's very bright, crystal clear, and truly beautiful.  It literally has the best picture of any TV I shopped for, including the Sony's and Samsung's. My grandfather watched the NCAA basketball tournament with me last year and during every commercial he would remark, \"LG: Life's Good\" because we were enjoying ourselves so much watching the games on the TV (with a Bose 321 home theater system attached).  Even several months later, I still love watching HD football and NASCAR races on it.  It just doesn't get any better with the superb LED-LCD picture quality.Lately I have been getting a lot of use out of the USB input slots, too.  I've started recording a lot of HD videos with new Flip Mino and Kodak Zi10 HD cameras over the past month and both of those cameras have a USB output on them.  Well, all I have to do is plug them directly into the side of this TV and my newly recorded videos automatically start playing in HD.  No more burning DVDs or complicated transferring of media from one device to the other.  This TV is simply plug and play.Switching between inputs is easy, even with the universal cable remote that I use with the TV.  I have 2 HDMI cables, standard coax, standard video, and fiber optic audio cables all plugged in and had no problems with setup or use.The TV is surprising flat and lightweight too.The bottom line is that this is the best TV of any of my friends and family.  It's the best picture you can get, outside of some hugely expensive 3-D setup.  And using a small Bose 321 home theater system (with just 2 speakers) is perfect for my living room viewing experience.  No problems or issues at all.  Can't recommend this TV at this price high enough.  Easy worth double.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply Amazing!", "Author": "jake", "ReviewID": "RU20R0TV5QE5V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't be more satisfied with the features of this TV alongside with its price tag. First off, I am truly surprised how few reviews there are on this model in comparison to the  LG42LV5500. I did my homework before buying a new set, and both of these models are exactly the same. The only difference is the lv5500 has a magic remote. But this tv comes with the magic remote \"feature\", meaning you can always buy the remote in the future at around $70.I consider this LG unbeatable with all that it offers. The picture is flawless, brilliant in colors, contrast and detail. I feel no motion lag as with some 60hz models. And am truly grateful to have the 120hz. It has a decent amount of user manual settings including colors and pic modes, but not overwhelming and simple enough for the ordinary ind.. The Trumotion feature is not to my liking, as it makes the picture look like some soap opera, taking away from that \"cinema feel\". So that is up to ones personal liking, but I simply turn it off. The amount of inputs in the back is staggering, and that is one thing I researched before buying. I needed to hook up anything and everything I would ever need in the future, and this model does not dissappoint. 4 hdmi's, 2 usb's, ethernet and wireless, 2 rgbs, components, optical,comp monitor, etc. I have my playstation, internet and hd antenna hooked up and all work with true precision and quality. The home menu is friendly and appealing. More than average apps online. The streaming does not work \"great\" but it is \"good\" I would say it would be more fun to use the internet and streaming apps with the magic remote, that is the only place where it can really play a positive effect. But the browser on this thing is lagging in speed. So don't expect to be surfing at lightning speed. After all this is a TV not a Mac. And we haven't gotten to a point where TV browsers reach astonishing speeds. For this model it is good to have this feature, with hopes to update it in the future.I am truly happy with this LG, and it should have much more reviews and likes from people who put in their time into buying the best quality product for a reasonable price. It is by no means a tech junkies dream, but a very sturdy design for an intermediate to experienced user.One thing I wanna point out is about the LED lighting. I wanted to buy LED because these lights are much more precise, and they emit light that is closer to a natural lights spectrum. This means the colors are more natural is easier on the eyes. They also emit no uv radiation compared to the regular CCFL tubes. I do love how the LED's light up the screen, very even distribution and great contrast. The only issue is you can notice small light  leakage around the top of the screen when the pic is completely black. It is very minor and only noticeable slightly when I play games. But with regular tv viewing, its hardly ever seen. So it is a very minor flaw in comparison to the benefit of LED!!!Overall I recommend this Set 100%, you will not find all these features for such a low price.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Local Dimming is VERY distracting - Too bad", "Author": "DJA", "ReviewID": "RBNFUIZAWCW9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hate to be the first person to give this TV a less than perfect score, but the local dimming effect on a mostly black screen is dramatically distracting; I'm surprised that it hasn't been mentioned in other reviews. (It has been on the LV5500 as \"backlight bleed\") FWIW, this unit has an IPS panel.When white text is shown against a black screen, the backlighting goes wild in a horizontal band across the screen. I also have the magic motion remote and the cursor causes the same effect: as the cursor moves, there is a bright halo that surrounds it everywhere is goes. It's distracting to the point that I'm considering returning this unit. And that's too bad because the picture quality is really outstanding otherwise. The colors are natural and lifelike.I was aware of the potential drawbacks of local dimming, but I didn't expect it to be so noticeable.Also, the web browser has frozen twice in less than a week. The only fix is to shut off the TV.Here's what televisioninfo.com says about the identical LV5500:\"Note that the LG 42LV5500 has an LED backlighting that allows for local dimming. In essence, the LEDs are arranged in zones and the brightness of each zone can be controlled according to the content on the screen. Ideally, this means that the mouth of a black cave will remain deep black, while the surrounding snowy hills of the Arctic will be as bright as the screen can produce.Unfortunately, there do not appear to be enough zones on the LG 42LV5500 to create the proper effect. On a dark screen, the smallest bit of white content (text, for instance) sends the backlight in that zone skyrocketing. It's distracting and there's no way to disable it.\"UPDATE 11/26/11:I'm keeping this TV and upgrading my rating. The local dimming issue is real on a dark screen/white text situation, but it probably does more good the rest of the time. And, the rest of the time the image is nearly flawless. Beautiful. As someone else pointed out, there are ways to enable a menu where you can disable LD, but some who've accessed the menu leave it on after experimenting. The GAME mode does also disable LD as well, and you can adjust the image in this mode to a large degree.So, all things considered, this is a very good unit and a great deal. No regrets; highly recommended.(Calibration settings I used: [...])", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantasic TV at a Great Price!", "Author": "craigtaz", "ReviewID": "R1GDBY8PMO8FY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I began shopping for a 42\" LED TV about two weeks ago. I am limited to a 42\" only, as that is the largest size TV my entertainment center will allow. I don't need anything larger than that anyway, so I am happy with that configuration. I did research on all of the brands that I had seen in the stores, and found that LG seemed to make one of the best rated TV's in that size. I then went to LG's website to narrow down the model that I wanted. Then I ran into a problem, there are ZERO retail stores near me that sell any 42\" LG TV's, let alone the 42LV5400, the model that I really wanted. WalMart.com stocks an older model LG 42\", but it did not have the same new features as the 42LV5400.I was delighted to find that Amazon not only sells this model, but does so for less than the older model offered by WalMart.com. I was even more delighted during the checkout process...I also ordered the optional Magic Motion remote control. There was a hidden promo during checkout that gave me a full credit for the remote, so I got it for free! Throw in the free shipping and zero sales tax, and I was happier than you know what!Now, my review of the actual TV. When I first turned it on, I liked the picture, but I was slightly disappointed in the quality. It wasn't as true to life as some of the other 120hz LED's that I had seen in stores.  After I enabled the wi-fi, the on-screen menu told me that I needed to update the TV's software, which I did. After the TV re-booted, I was amazed at how much the picture quality had improved. It is now better than I had hoped for. Needless to say, I am happy about my purchase from Amazon and thrilled with my new LG TV.5 stars!", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible TV for an Incredible Price", "Author": "C. GRANT", "ReviewID": "R29192FYZGVQRX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is, quite honestly, a truly spectacular television. I thought so from the moment I unboxed it and set it up, but I forced myself to wait for a little over a week before I reviewed it, to be sure that my opinion wouldn't change. It most certainly didn't. I've been researching TVs for several months now, focusing on one I could use as both a standard television as well as a monitor for my computer; this made for a difficult selection process as many TV's offer a fine signal for regular broadcast, but suffer from visual latency and resolution issues when put to gaming or PC video. This is especially true when using such a large screen as a computer monitor (the LCD I replaced with this beast was only 23\"), considering how close one sits to their computer. Originally, I had looked at LG's 42LK520 LCD screen. It's a solid monitor, and my experience seeing it in person at Walmart and Best Buy was positive, but the LV5400 blows it out of the water.IN THE BOX: Remote (NOT BACKLIT!), WiFi Adapter, 1 AV and 1 Component Adapter Cables (These are listed as \"gender cables\" - they are actually adapters to add an additional AV or Component input to the TV, as the input panel only has 2 AV and 1 Component input directly available), Cleaning Cloth, Owner's Guide and Owner's Guide on CD, and NERO's MediaHome 4 Essentials on CD (this is to aid in connecting the TV to your home's DNLA network... particularly useful if you are not using Windows 7 devices). NOTE: This TV IS Windows 7 compatible.Out of the box this TV was a breeze to set up. You WILL need to have a Philips head screwdriver to attach the included stand (the panel includes screws and holes for standard 200mmx200mm wall mounts as well) but the process is quick and painless, and at just under 30lbs, the panel is fairly easy for even a single person to move, though you may wish to have a buddy help for safety's sake. After that, just a few clicks through the TV's setup wizard and you'll be good to go. Included in the box is a WiFi adapter, and should you buy this TV I highly recommend that you make a point of connecting it (or else through the available Ethernet port) to your home's network and updating the TV's onboard software/firmware, before you do anything else. This is easily accomplished through the TV's menu system. The software update improves the video processing and menus on the TV, as well as the Smart TV options. I have yet to use many of the included Smart TV features, as I am running a PC through this TV, but patching does seem to have an impact.I mainly use this unit as a PC monitor, and in that capacity it works wonderfully, easily outperforming smaller specialized screens I've had in the past. The LV5400 are LED-lit LCD's, and as such are extremely thin (roughly 1\" except at the input panel and of course the base) and very light, making it an easy fit (and a safe one!) on most decent-sized desks. The contrast, color palette and resolution are astounding, even at two feet away. More importantly, the screen suffers no perceptible lag between input and display; it took quite a bit of research but LG's Canadian website ([...]) lists the response time for this panel as 2.6ms, in-line with high-end dedicated PC monitors. I'm using an HDMI cable as my attachment between my video card and the display and achieving 1080/60p resolution with few necessary tweaks of the settings, suggesting that you're likely to get the same impressive results from virtually any other HDMI-connected device. If you plan on using this as a PC monitor but your video card does NOT have an HDMI port, the TV also has a standard RGB PC input, so it should be possible to attach any PC to this monitor to great effect. It should be noted that even with my video card set to output in 1920x1080 resolution, the TV displayed black margins/borders around the image until I set the Aspect Ratio setting to \"Cinema Zoom 1\", at which point it fit to the screen perfectly (the zoom and vertical and horizontal orientation can be further tweaked if necessary); also, though the TV supports input labeling, if you're attaching to a PC via HDMI, DO NOT label the input as \"PC\" - this removes the \"Cinema Zoom\" Aspect Ratio setting and seems to make the margins irremovable. I have my input labeled as \"Game\" at the moment and this seems to avoid the problem. Zooming the image the small amount necessary does not seem to reduce the resolution perceptibly.As a TV, this is an equally amazing choice. I am only running a simple digital antenna through it, but the channel quality and the number of channels supported is tremendous! Some reviewers have complained about the TruMotion settings, and it's true that if you have them set to High, motion can appear unnaturally smooth, however the TruMotion settings can be easily fine-tuned, and I find that set to Low, the image smoothing is a great feature... especially watching football! This TV was MADE for high-def viewing - take advantage of it!In regards to some of the issues/complaints regarding this television: an external review at CNET suggested that the viewing angle on this TV is not ideal. While I'm certain that there are TV's with better, my experience has been that the image is almost perfectly clear even from a nearly side-on angle. Also, a few reviewers here have complained about \"local dimming\" and light bleed issues. I suspect that people having those problems may have received faulty panels: local dimming is supposed to counteract light bleed, so if the feature was active, it would be REDUCING the amount of bleed people are reporting... those having that issue probably have a panel with an error in the local dimming feature, or else with the signal source or the cable carrying it (for example, classic AV hookups -the yellow video plug- are not of sufficient quality to deliver a crisp, blur-free image). Several of my tests of the contrast, including Mythbusters S10E7 (the spinning bullet, which has scenes of a black gun against a bright snowy background) as well as credits from numerous shows and movies both in standard- and high-def have shown NO bleed or banding whatsoever. People having these troubles should check their inputs, their display settings (backlighting, contrast, etc) and call Amazon or LG if they're still having trouble. As an owner of this TV I can promise this is NOT an issue with all LV5400 units (at least not the 42\"). The other complaints, regarding speaker quality, aren't off-base. The built in speakers aren't the best, but frankly, a smart shopper isn't buying a TV for its speakers. They do fine if you can't afford a soundbar or other external speakers (preferably something with some bass), but they'll get you by until you can. Speaker quality certainly isn't bad enough to justify deducting any points from this TV's review.In the end, for less than $700, with free shipping and no sales tax, you can't go wrong getting this TV. There may be better models out there, but not for the price.NOTE: As another reviewer pointed out, Amazon is presently offering the LG Magic Motion remote FREE with this TV, making it essentially identical to the LV5500, the 42\" model of which retails in my area as of 11/23/2011 at $900 + tax! The MMR isn't really a killer-app for this TV, but it can be useful for quickly navigating menus, and so it's certainly worth it at no extra cost.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "Mr. Clean", "ReviewID": "R2K2Q8R0SODNWW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll make this short and to the point.

I ran some of my games on my Xbox 360 & PS3, I did not notice lag like others have mentioned.  I played a few blu ray movies and they looked spectacular. I'm very pleased with the display.Now for the not so great; I liked the idea of a smart TV with integrated apps but after playing with them on the TV they didn't seem necessary for me.  For example, I run Netflix off my Xbox 360, Amazon video was nice.  The other apps were ok and I have PC for web browsing.  I liked the idea of streaming video to the TV since I have a lot of MKV movie files with DTS audio and I would no longer need my WDTV media player.  Not the case, the TV will play the video file but cannot handle the DTS audio, so I'm back to using the WDTV playerI have the TV mounted on a Zline Vitoria stand.

Even companies like Vizio have QC controls in place to eliminate dead pixels in their panels (or at least from reaching consumers).  There's really no excuse for this anymore.  It's not like dead pixels are some new fangled problem from 1998.  It's simply not acceptable.  Haha, enough ranting.Aside from this, the pictures seems pretty good so far.

At first one may not think so, because the box is rather thin, but once opened, one can see that LG went to great lengths to protect the finish in the transit process.  Initial set-up was fairly straight forward considering I did not read the instructions.  There are two pieces to the stand; assemble them first and then attach it to the TV.Once powered on, the TV walks you through initial set-up, which is a painless process.  The only thing it doesn't do is auto-update the firmware, which I can understand because not everyone will utilize the wireless feature.  One criticism I had of the menu system is that the advanced menu system can be hard to find for the non-tech savvy customer, as it is located in a smart TV menu, and does not have a dedicated button to access directly.The picture is excellent, and pleasing to the eyes.  If you don't want to mess with the settings very much, the auto-calibration picture wizard is easy to follow and will take care of your basic needs.  If self-calibrating, the process is straightforward, and the TV offers a plethora of options for picture customization.Finally, I would say that the speakers on this TV are fine for normal television watching, but if you really enjoy a powerful audio experience, you will definitely want to buy a separate audio system.

If you're not into the 3-d stuff yet, and can live without a drive-in theater screen stuffed into your living room, you should check out the 42lv5400. You will not regret buying one.

Get more that what you paid for!", "Author": "M. Aquino \"AQ\"", "ReviewID": "R4WKBE4JAVNN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a 42\" Phillips HDTV, while it was not bad it was something of a learning experience. It was a 60Hz job and at the time I just assumed that all HDTVs would look about the same except when compared to the high-end ones.When I saw the picture on a couple of friends' Samsung and Sharp I was quite disappointed compared to mine. Theirs looks so much more vivid, sharper and warmer compared to mine. The Phillips did the job but it felt like a watching a 42\" CRT on an LCD screen.I finally decided to do my homework and make the right purchase this time. I shopped around and compared features of TVs like Sony Bravia, Sharp Aquos, Samsung and others. After reading the features I decided to take a chance and get this LG 47LV5400. I have never owned an LG product except for a company issued phone which, I have to admit, took a lot of abuse from me.When it arrived I unboxed it and left it on for at least 30mins to get a true idea of the picture. Compared to my Phillips this TV is just like looking through a window at real life. No motion artifacts, warm vivid colors, and those were just the factory settings.There are plenty of settings to tweak on this baby. Enough to overwhelm a novice and also keep a technophile pleasantly happy. Don't be afraid about the abundance of settings. The important ones are in the regular setup menu and the extras are in Expert Mode if you want to tweak some more. I love that LG gave owners full control over the strength of the TrueMotion feature. I like it somewhere in between regular film and the \"soap opera\" effect. Many other HDTVs seem to have an all or nothing approach where this effect is either on or off.The Cinema picture settings are working pretty well for me so far until I get my Disney WoW BD to calibrate to the best of my ability. Regular TV is still kind of bland, but I think it must be something with my signal since Comcast switched to digital, so that is a moot point. HDTV and DVD sources are really something to behold now. DVDs look better than I remember and HD pictures are the most pristine I have seen. Sports, shows, cartoons, action movies all look incredible good with no motion artifacts, ghosting or blurring.Sound is not spectacular, no TV has ever impressed me in that area but the speakers on this TV do a decent job and with the sound settings you can do enough to be pleased with them for general viewing. I can say that they are much better to where I can hear subtle details while playing games of watching TV that I could not with my Phillips.For internet connectivity is has a built-in Ethernet port and a wireless dongle. Kudos to LG for giving users options to the type of connectivity consumers can have without charging extra for it. Many SmartTVs only have one or the other, and yet others only have connectivity if you buy the dongle separately for a ridiculous price. I chose to use the Ethernet since I already had a port close to the TV.The apps, especially Netflix are great. No more turning on the PS3 to watch a movie. Like many TV apps it is a little lacking in some aspects but nothing major. Youtube looks better than I expected, especially if the video you are watching as a 720 or 1080 stream. My gripe with this app is that it just starts up and connects you to an apparently \"featured\" video. You cannot sign on to your own account, at least I have not figured it out yet if you can. It has a rather basic search feature which works well enough. It is OK to watch online series like Kids React or JennaMarbles to show off to your friends but a more web-like YouTube feature would be appreciated. That is up to the developers though, not LG.Google Maps is great to look at on this machine. Satellite view looks the best for watching closeups of places I have been to in the states and abroad. Screen refresh is pretty slow when moving around the screen so don't expect to do any serious browsing on it. It takes about 1-2 seconds for the screen to show up. It is a TV first after all.I managed to get the free MagicWand Remote offer. I believe they still have it as of this review, so if you just add it to your cart the amount will be subtracted right before you do the final submission for your order.It only has some basic functions such as channels and volume, home, mute, navigation and enter but they are enough for everyday viewing.In terms of responsiveness and accuracy it you have a Wii then you have a good idea how it works. I don't know if LG engineers has a disconnect when planning the cable length because it is barely long enough to put the receiver over the top of the TV. I had to use a USB extension cable to finally stick it to the bottom of the TV over the LG logo. You might have to play around with it to find the optimum place for your setup. If you point to the bottom of the screen it brings up a small menu from which you can access all the options as well as a small keypad to change the channel. Once if a while the reception with the wand goes a muck where I will be pointing at one part of the screen and the pointer is several inches off. A good quick shake of the wand seems to bring it back to center.These are my initial impressions. I will post more as I get to know this baby a little better.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Seemed great until deactivated pixels showed up", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2TAPSH7NRRGUR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Everything about the TV seemed great until I noticed a pair of dots in the middle left of the screen that were not lighting up.

It's hard to put it into a pros and cons category because a lot of based on preference.PictureBiggest contrast ratio for its dollar! Amazing refresh rate as well. Good for sports and tv. Options available to change the picture quality which should be done for video games to reduce the \"laggy\" feeling. Once changed, video games are really nice.SoundNot the best but if you really want good sound buy a surround sound. No tv comes with great sound because of this. The quality is really clear but it's no where near surround sound quality. The LG my roommate owns in the living room has surround sound so it was unnecessary to have another set in my bedroom.SizeReally good. I have poor eyesight and can view this tv fine from my bed. I did need to buy a new stand for it since my old one used to be an old desk.RemoteOnly used for Netflix. I have DirecTV and use that remote for everything else.WiFiBuilt-in is DIFFERENT than \"ready\" so be careful if you purchase a TV different than this one. This tv came with a USB wireless adapter which works just fine.How are the internet apps?Poor and useless. Didn't find Pandora but that's okay since I own a computer and iPhone so Pandora will run off that just fine if necessary. There are also music channels on my tv package.Why this model?The LV5500 is the model right above this one and the only difference is the Wii Mote thing sold with it. However, the Wii Mote thing is only $50 and the LV5500 is $100+ more so even if I did want the special remote I could just buy it separately. The prices are probably inaccurate as time goes by so anyone will need to price check everything themselves.Why not 3D?Technology should be an upgrade to something we already do, not an excuse to try something new. Very few of the movies I watch would benefit from being in 3D at all and the contrast ratio on most of those tvs is less than this one or much, much more expensive. I suppose watching Avatar or something from National Geographic would be cool in 3D but that's it.How is the wireless access?Works just fine and doesn't reduce my laptop/desktop/phone speed. The only thing I use the wireless for is Netflix and it runs fine. My roommate has another LG TV in the living room and my PS3 is hooked into that to run Netflix (there's also a Wii but that's not in HD so we pass on that).Usable as a 2nd monitor?Yup! This is why I do not care about \"internet apps\" and the like. I have a laptop that can easily hook up to the tv as well as my desktop (although that requires the DVI-D to HDMI cable) to run videos and whatnot.Other media inputs?Has the usual USB port to play videos. Have not used that yet but my roommate's LG TV runs the videos fine in the formats the tv states it supports.Dead pixels?None so far. Industry standards allow a few here and there but I have not noticed, and do not sit close enough, to view them if they are present.OTHER TIPS1) Measure the space available before purchase! Glad I did not buy the 47'' model because it would have been too large for my bedroom and the viewing distance. If you have questions about the viewing distance for TV size google it.2) Save the box. I'll move eventually and this thing would take up a lot of space and I do not want it damaged at all.OVERALLI did a lot of research comparing this to Sony and other big name brands. I required a high contrast ratio, high refresh rate, video playback from USB devices, 42-47'', and the standard input types. This model came with the internet which was unavoidable but allows me to watch Netflix, as if being able to watch Netflix on a desktop, laptop, iphone, and another tv was not enough. Wish it had Pandora available but since I do not own the surround sound it wasn't important to me.

Going to the LG website, I compared both products side-by-side and discovered that the only difference was that the 5500 came with the magic remote whereas the 5400 did not! Amazon's deal was even better; not only was the 5400 on sale, but the magic remote was included free of charge! So essentially I got a 5500 that I wanted for a much lower price than I would have paid, even here!TV performance has been flawless. At first, I was very disappointed that the images were no better, just larger, than on my old JVC 32\" mammoth heavy old style TV. Then I realized I just had regular, not HD cable service and DVR! After looking at the outlandish prices the cable company wanted for HD, I took the plunge and ditched cable, bought an antenna from Amazon, and now have stellar HD quality programs on the regular networks, which is what I mostly watch anyway.The TV remote is easy to use and Netflix and Amazon movies were incredibly easy to set up (I already had a wireless network set up). The sound is greatly enhanced with the addition of the LG Sound Bar (separate review) but was more than adequate as TV speakers go. I realize now I should have gone with the 47\" instead, but that wasn't on sale. I don't \"do\" Facebook so I can't comment on that function; I would have liked Pandora on the LG Smart Suite but it isn't included.Ironically, I have yet to open the magic remote from the box; I find it easy to use the TV remote to navigate the Smart Suite choices, options menus, etc. So if you're looking for 5500 quality and don't care about the magic remote, get a 5400 while you can and save some money.========================Update 03/2012TV continues to be impressive and working well; the only oddity is that Netflix periodically won't load, or prompts for an email and password. This is not a router or TV issue, but Netflix, as my Amazon prime video account works fine when Netflix won't. After some time, it seems Netflix \"recalls\" the original information and I have access once again.========================Update 09/2013So far, the TV still works flawlessly and gives a beautiful picture. I use a TiVo system with it now and it set up very easily. The only thing I do not like about the set is the Netflix interface. It is only rewinds and forwards in blocks of 30 seconds, and although you can pause on one scene, if you want to rewind just a bit to capture lost dialogue for example, you can't do it; you have to rewind one packet of about 30 seconds before that and play it again. I thought this was a Netflix interface, but the TiVo Netflix interface is far superior and let's you do true \"frame\" forwarding (I know, there are no \"frames\" in digital movies) or rewinding.

But wish there is an alternate provided by the manufacturer to upgrade this in future. There are not much apps available in the LGAppstore to use it as a smart tv (when compared to Samsung/Sony).

Both pictures look great.  There is no lag in gaming.  The viewing angle is wide.  Sound is adequate.The WIFI Dongle works great.  I have not had any issues with losing internet connectivity.  My router is downstairs, and my TV is upstairs.  Don't expect to get great quality from the internet browser.  If you want to browse the web on your tv, get a PS3.  The only reason I purchased a TV with WIFI is to receive firmware updates and stream video without having to use an external device.  My Samsung Galaxy SII works much faster for browsing and social media.The only apps I really use are Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and Media Center.  Media Center is excellent.  It uses PLEX to connect to your network to stream music, photos, and video to your TV.  Plex discovered my ITunes account and I was able to upload all of my music to the application.  I can now stream my entire digital collection from my computer to my TV!!The Magic Motion Remote is a must!!  I never want to use a regular remote again.  It's motion controls are accurate and fun to use.  It makes the use of the internet apps much easier than with the standard remote.  Just point and click.If you don't want to shell out the money for the magic remote (or didn't get one free when you bought the tv), there is a remote control android app available for free.  I can use my phone to control the tv through the wireless connection.  My phone serves as a tablet.  I can slide my finger over the phone and control the cursor on-screen like a mouse.  Also, you can shake the phone to bring up all of the apps.  All of the volume, channel, etc. controls are also available through the use of this app.My biggest complaint at this time is the HDMI ports are on the side of the TV.  The HDMI cables are not too noticeable, but do stick out slightly.Great Job LG!I used some of the info for my review from LCD TV Buying Guide.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally got a working TV", "Author": "S.

On Dec 2nd when I switched on the TV the bottom left corner of the TV was totally dark. No amount of increasing brightness or backlight helped. We called the LG customer service, they said it could be that the pixels are not lighting up for one corner. Called up Amazon for a replacement and they said they were out of stock with no confirmation on when the next lot would arrive.We really liked this TV overall though:a) Outdated Flash makes browser partially handicapped.b) Trumotion cannot be disabled on YoutubeNow waiting for a new TV to show up on Amazon so that we can get it replaced, but going by the increasing list of used TVs it seems that it might be sometime coming. Would love suggestions with which TV can I replace this TV.Update 03/01/2013:Amazon was kind enough to pitch in with the difference of the cost of the TV and the price when we returned it so that we could order a new one.

Was worried about purchasing an LG TV rather than Sony or Samsung, but it definitely exceeded my expectations.Pro's-Picture quality is almost too good! I can see all of the actors blemishes and makeup. It is so clear!-The true motion is still something I am getting used to but find amazing. Definitely a cool feature to have and makes everything look so great.-Plenty of HDMI inputs-Wifi is a really cool feature to look at pictures from other computers-USB: easily insert a flash drive and watch a movie. No lag and amazing quality.-I like the touch power and volume buttons on the TV itself.-Power consumption is extremely low for such a big TV. I think it was $15 a year assuming you watch the TV everyday for 5 hours.-Picture adjustment is simple and quick.-Picture looks amazing at any angle you watch the TV in.Con's-Apps seem kind of useless for now. And there isn't many apps to even chose from either.But maybe they will update some of this in the future.-Wasn't able to play  the sound on the movies I put on a USB drive. They were MKV files but the picture was perfect. Wasn't able to play an MP4 file either.-I wish you could change the quick menu settings to different ones-You are definitely in need of something with a full keyboard if you plan on using the apps or surfing the internet. Annoying to use the remote to type out everything. So much clicking. Might be different when my magic remote comes in.I find the Pro's definitely outweigh the Con's for $650. To other people looking for TV's, definitely chose a smaller TV with a better picture than a larger TV with a lower quality. Makes you feel like your money was well spent. Went from a Sony 32'' LCD HDTV KDL-32L504 and find this a enormous upgrade. Also, if the TV that meets your price does not have many reviews, don't buy the TV. Always look for one that has lots of happy reviews.

The 60hz 1080p picture is much easier on the eyes than my old plasma. I feel like the font is crisper and computer applications are much easier to view.2) Decent viewing angle. Nothing will beat a plasma on viewing angle. My other monitors are IPS panels so I was very worried about a non-IPS LCD panel and viewing angle. It is hardly noticeable unless you are trying to look for a color and brightness shift.3) Good with video games. 1080p high frame rate games look great. No latency issues I can detect.4) Firmware updates were super easy. The latest firmware gives you plenty of ways to customize your picture to your taste.5) Sips power. My plasma was 323 watts, this uses less than 25 watts most of time.6) It does a good job with TWC's compression artifacts(google wiki compression artifacts) which are very noticeable until you turn on MPEG noise reduction. The noise reduction algorithms work well considering it is hard to get rid of the artifacts in fast moving sports scenes.Cons:1) Wireless LAN - It found my network but could not connect. I am the IT guy at work and I screwed with it for about 45 minutes and gave up. I am running DD-WRT(DD-WRT.com) open source router software and even when I dropped out all security features it still would not connect. No biggie though, I just ran a RJ45 cable through the wall and TV is happy being on the wired network.2) Blacks are okay. Nothing to write home about.3) The dynamic contrast algorithms just make the picture worse in my opinion. I turned off all the dynamic contrast options.4) My plasma did better with certain shades of orange and purple.

The Smart TV Platform is robust, and pretty good in it's organization.  I believe the loadtimes for Apps is a tad slower than I'd prefer, but the Apps seem pretty stable (barring TV Guide, Yoga Trainer Apps, both fail installation).  I'm a heavy Hulu+, Netflix user and they work great!  The video is great for the streaming Apps.  Beyond the great hardware specs, the PLEX MediaLink App was a huge selling point (this App was the one that sold me on this TV).  While I think the App could be changed a bit for easier access and view of my stored media, it's still a well built App what works well with it's Plex Media Server counterpart on my Mac Mini. It even streams HD media over wifi without bogging down, which I can't say the same for my PS3, and it's farther away from the router!!  Plex also does music channels via iTunes, Sound Cloud etc. but I haven't figured out how to play media that's DRM and not!  I've got a post in the PLEX forum (since it's a music channel in the Plex App).  I don't understand how there is Not a Pandora App or Last.fm, when they have Napster and MOG. These are 2 Paid subscription Music Apps, and I don't think I'll be forking out monthly cash for internet radio stations, as I do for netflix and Hulu+ (or Amazon Prime/Vudu if I ever choose to try them out!)I've got a Magic Wand Remote coming, which will allow me to have Wii like interaction with the TV, which I'm looking forward to trying out!  Especially since they do have an App store (like Apple's App Store).  I don't think I'll find an App I'll pay money to buy, but I like their efforts.  I wonder why they didn't go with an Android platform to take advantage of their App Marketplace. But I like the effort they are making, compared to my Vizio 42\" w/VIA.  It's gallery of Internet Apps is small, ful of a lot of Crap Apps (I don't want to download an App to show me ford and Mercury cars!, let allow several App to advertise)The Smart TV platform is pretty good, especially considering the ios/Android competition.  I hope LG takes it serious and keeps updating it, expanding.  This aspect is becoming as important to New models of Tvs as the hardware features!The video looks very good when on eye level.  Off Axis at eye level is very good as well.  But I have it on my mantle above my fireplace, on it's stand and the off-axis def. effects the darkness.  Once I have a good TV mount that'll be solved.  The audio via the speakers is ok, but I haven't seen any TV FLat Panel or not, that had built-in speakers that are worthwhile!!I found the inputs to be ok, (wifi, USB, compontent & HDMI) but the outputs is a bit lacking. Digital out and Headphones, and that's it! So it has no non-optical outputs for sound beyond stereo.  Not an issue for any descent reciever, but that's a later purchase.  Audio quality via headphone jack to a temp 5.1 small speaker setup is better than stock, but I know Digital out is the preferred output I need!Overall price, features, Smart TV platform, and ease of use makes it a great buy.  While it's not perfect in software and hardware, I think you could def. do a lot worse for the same money or more.  Yes I did pay slightly less for my visio 42\" 240hz 4000000:1 contrast w/via, more imputs/outputs and remote w/qwerty keyboard (admittedly a cool feature for doing searchings, and configurations); a year ago. I turned from buying a 2nd vizio w/same plus 3D, for this TV because of the Platform and specifically PLEX.

Highly recommend a sound bar. With such a phenomenal picture, great sound completes the experience. The menu experience is not Apple. More complicated and fragmented than it needs to be. You do get used to it, but being an Apple fanboy, you get spoiled by the wonderful simplicity of anything Apple.Couple items of note: The optical audio out is not variable. If attaching a stand alone sound bar, recommend using the 1/8\" headphone output - it IS variable. As other reviewers have noted, TruMotion makes the picture look like a soap opera - I turned it off. The DLNA functionality is cool too. Although they only give you PC software - WTF? Found a DLNA download from TVMobili for Mac that is recognized by the TV and allows me to stream video, music and pictures from iTunes, iPhoto.

It's too bad you can't upgrade the Smart TV software or firmware to allow access to newer apps. It seems like LG should provide a way for that.2. The Chromecast appliance has major problems with this TV. When you plug the Chromecast appliance into an HDMI port it goes into an endless booting loop and will not boot up to be available. At first I thought I had a defective Chromecast appliance so I called Google Support and they shipped me a new one but it did the same thing. I called them again and they shipped yet another replacement but it also does the same thing. My conclusion is that the problem is not the Chromecast appliance. If you remove the Chromecast from the HDMI port and press the reset button, it boots successfully and connects to the wireless network and when you then plug it in a HDMI port and switch to that input source it shows it is ready for casting but as soon as you try to cast to it, it crashes the Chromecast appliance and it goes back into an infinite boot loop.

The TV is of very poor quality. It is a lemon and they just keep saying until it cannot be repaired they won't do anything. I think three service visits in three months to address continuing issues indicates a problem with the TV and an inability to repair it.

Arrived in great shape, in a timely matter. First off, for a perspective, I wanted a TV - not another computer; so I couldn't care less about its internet capabilities. As for all the references to it's (or any TV's) speakers: please do yourself a huge favor and get some type of decent sound system. It doesn't have to be outrageously expensive. But high quality sound is a great deal of the overall experience. Save yourself the time of reviewing/comparing any HDTV based on its audio/speakers - they ALL suck.A suggested word of caution or warning about comparing TVs at retail stores: Make sure you are comparing apples to apples. What I mean by that is make sure all the TVs you are comparing to each other are using the exact same input source. If you look at any HDTV that's using a BluRay disc player as its input source - it will blow away any and all other HDTVs that are not using BluRay at that given moment. Same for comparing if various TVs are showing different programs from cable/dish/etc. For example: My very first experience after hooking this LG model up at home was an afternoon outdoor football game played at the University of Houston. I was shocked at how poor the picture clarity was. I thought I'd made a big mistake with this purchase. Either that, or I was just unlucky enough to get a lemon. Later that same day, I watched another college football game - I think it was the LSU/Georgia SEC championship game. The colors and clarity were beautiful - truly impressive and enjoyable. I've noticed before (and since) that picture quality can fluctuate noticably at different sporting events. It's not your TV. So... be careful when comparing.Turns out this was an excellent value buy for me. Was the largest size I could get to fit into my \"allowed\" space in the living room. (Thanks, Dear.) We've had a huge/heavy/deep 27\" Panansonic HDTV for years; and I'm impressed how much the quality of this LG's 42\" picture stands out, compared to that old HDTV. I can't find one thing to complain about. It's lightweight, easy to handle. If there is a better quality picture out there, I'm betting you pay for it; and not just a few bucks.The only thing that could have concerned me - and may well concern someone else - is the absolute necessity to connect the TV to one's internet service. As mentioned above, I didn't -  and still don't - intend on using this TV's internet capabilities. Kind of a weird series of events unfolded when I first hooked this TV up. First, because of all the research I had done - including many helpful Amazon reviews - I tried to manually update all the \"calibrations\" as recommended, as opposed to simply picking one of the more generic options provided. Ran into a bit of a problem here. The TV only listed about a third of the calibrations I was expecting/hoping to see, based on a printout I had in hand. So, while a bit stunned by this, I - for some reason - decided to see if I could get the TV connected to our WiFi. FYI, it was quick and easy; and it worked perfectly. What I now noticed was that there was some sort of firmware/software update to be had for the TV, which I ran. Afterward, it told me another update was available; so I ran that as well. I, then, went back to try to update the calibrations manually again. There they all were now, just as I had expected to begin with. Huh?!?!?!?! This means - and I'm guessing this is applicable to all modern HDTVs, not just LG or just this model - that you HAVE to connect your TV to the internet, if for no other reason, than to get firmware/software updates to it. It's a good thing we have WiFi AND that the TV connected to it with no problem, even though our router is housed in another part of the house --- because there's no way I was going to hard-wire our living room just to have an Ethernet connection to a freaking TV. In essence, I would have only had part of my TV available to me. That is quite the bizarre requirement. Anyhow, just another potential \"gotcha\" to be aware of when buying (probably) any HDTV today.Speaking of these calibrations, I'll touch on something that's been brought up throughout reviews, especially here in Amazon: the \"Tru Motion\" setting. It's been generally advised to either turn it OFF or put it on a very low setting. The bottom line is this is all about personal taste - yours. Because I had been watching a lot of football games, I actually put it on a fairly high setting. I like watching sporting events with that high setting. Surprisingly, my wife and I both kind of enjoy this setting for any programming. It's spooky; but it's kind of cool. But... I can understand that many people would find it way too freaky. So, be sure to play around with this setting - or the generic settings -  to suit your own preference. [I have a non-scientific theory on this - and I may be all wet with this - but I'm wondering if people who attend plays often are more inclined to enjoy a higher \"Tru Motion\" setting; while just the opposite might be true for those who seldom or never attend plays.] My wife and I often comment on how we feel like we're in an intimate setting with the actors, whether it's a movie or NCIS. You feel like you're right there on the set, almost 3-D like - with the \"TruMotion\" setting on high. It's not for everyone; and we may tire of it eventually.Speaking of LG's \"Tru Motion\" and any other manufacturer out there describing and/or alluding to their specs on \"Refresh Rate\": As cynical as I've long been about how a lot of products are marketed to us consumers, I was disappointed to discover throughout my research that any given quasi-\"Refresh Rate\" may very well be a bunch of crap. Some even avoid the phrase Refresh Rate. They'll still give some inflated number in \"Hz\", though. This model TV is described as \"TruMotion 120Hz\". While the TruMotion setting obviously does something; I'm just not sure exactly what - technically. All I know is that if it was really and truly AND technically 120Hz, as opposed to only 60Hz, LG (or any manufacturer) would go out of their way to tell us it's a legitimate 120Hz refresh rate. They (their marketing dept.) wouldn't slide in some catch-phrase like \"TruMotion\", which would only serve to water that spec down. At least by using the term \"TruMotion\" along side \"120Hz\", they're not really and truly lying to us.Regarding the remotes, when we got our 42LV5400, it came with a free LG Magic Motion Remote. While I haven't used it since, it was fairly neccessary, or at least very helpful, when I hooked up the TV to our WiFi and ran the firmware/software updates. Trying to type in alpha-numerics with the other standard LG remote was a challenge, to say the least.An additional tip for those who might research WALL MOUNTS. I suggest, along with all your other research needed to meet your requirements, you check out the VideoSecu model MP27B W13, here in Amazon. When I got it, it was around $70, with free shipping, via Amazon. After seeing how much (hundreds and hundreds of dollars) many other wall mounts went for, I was, frankly, a little scared of ordering this model because of its low price. But I relied on the reviews - which rated it excellent - and I'm very happy (and richer) that I did. It it suprisingly heavy and solid and flexible. I needed a long extension, and this had one of the longest available.Good luck and happy hunting!", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best TV for the money and features", "Author": "J. Rodriguez \"RJ\"", "ReviewID": "R1NLNM4ASZAMMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Played around with settings for several days, even calibrated settings, and still I just go back to the Standard settings with a few minor tweaks for most of the inputs.  I turn off the Eye Care ( which adjusts brightness oddly ).  Turn off dynamic contrast, turn on dynamic color, turn off most of the noise reduction stuff, turn on Super Resolution and Real Cinema, turn on the extra white boost.  Adjust the backlight as a little more like 60-70 or so.  The rest I leave alone.  Played with them and tried to calibrate, but when i do it doesn't look as good as Standard.There is local dimming on this TV and it's not possible to turn it off unless you enable Game mode and change all the settings to the Standard settings.  Frankly, I was annoyed with it at first but then with it in Game mode I think I prefer local dimming on as it really makes the blacks look blacker with a full screen of video.Tru motion is an aquired taste.  Sometimes I like it and sometimes I don't.  On  blu-rays it depends...I turn it off for dramas, but on special effect movies i think it looks better turned on.  Low or High or User, it's your choice.  For OTA signals it doesn't seem to effect it as much.Netflix is nice...nicer than my 720P Roku.  I compared them both and LG is sharper...I think it outputs 1080P from Netflix?  Not sure.  But, it's sharper with HD signals.  Plus, there is the option for subtitles that I don't have on my first generation Roku.  For the online Apps like Netflix there is no User setting for the Tru-Motion.  Just low, high, and off.  Low is okay, but on some hand held cinema it can be very jittery.  Less jitter on a blu-ray.  My guess is the compression of the HD signal over Netflix/Amazon/etc.  The Roku on anHDMI connection has more control over the Tru Motion, but as I said it's ever so slighly less detailed.So, clarity or motion control your choice.Browser is as fast as a smartphone.  No flash.  But Vimeo works.  You tube only work with an app and sort of clunky too.  Looks very sharp, though.  Amazon app is great.  Have not tried Vudu yet or any of the others.  Hulu app is *terrible* and I've tried it on every video quality setting within the Hulu setup.  Just gets stuck all the time.  My first generation Roku at 720p works Waaay better with Hulu than the LG stick.The TV is quiet with no power supply noise.  Turning it on is very quick and there is no delay in switching channels or inputs.  Remote works well...the Magic Remote is fun, but not as good as a Wii Remote.  If youhave used a Wii, this is intuitive yet lacklaster in precision.  I put the receiver hub in the middle of the TV as it works best there.  sometime you can *nudge* the pointer to be more accurate by pushing it to the edge of the screen.  Word of caution, get rechargables Eneloop batteries for the remote or you'll be going through batteries REALLY fast.Sound is weak, but come on people it's a razor thin LED.  No room for any speakers.  I have to say the treble is clear and precise.  Better than my Philips LCD.  I don't have any problem hearing the clarity of the voices.  And it's plenty loud for such a thin speaker.  Don't complain about the sound - either buy a soundbar or at least some computer speakers for better sound.  Also, there is a headphone jack in the back if you need ( and I use it alot since I have toddlers who wake up easily ).Plenty of connections.  This is the weak point of the TV ...not much *room* for those connections.I had to use some thinner HDMI cables as the ones I had stuck out badly from the side.  Bulky cables will look ugly and you *might* need some angled HDMI cables.  The headphone jack is in BACK and that' annoying when i hook up my headphone extension cord.  I may have to find a solution for that.Only two USB connections - one for the Internet and one for the Magic Remote...no more left!Tried the network ability to play videos from my laptop.  If you have the capable formats, it's works very smoothly even off a 3 year old laptop.  Itunes videos won't work, though.Home movies are a breeze and frankly easier than moving them to a USB stick and reading it off the USB port.We have a Wii and I connected it with component cables.  Looks better than my Philips.  Use Game mode.  Wish I had an X360, but at least the Wii looks great.I haven't checked an SD signal as I don't have any SD equipment or SD cable.4 months with no problems.  I love the TV.  It tells me the time and weather as soon as I turn it on too.  Turns on fairly fast for an LED and is quiet with no discernible noise.  Did I mention it costs $15 per year to operate?  LED uses so much less electricity and gives off virtually no heat.

Sure you can do that with a separate box, I have an HDLIVE box on my old tube TV, but it is nice to have it integrated with the TV and controlled by one remote. Of course once you add your cable box you have another remote. By looking online I was able to get the codes to program my Comcast remote to control the LG TV too. The picture is great. The matte finish on the glass mostly eliminates annoying reflections. I had compared picture quality on a long line of TVs at Costco and Target and other than an outrageously expensive Sony model this one had the best picture in its size class.

The setup was easy, it came with a wireless adapter that was easy to hook up and connect to my wireless router. At the time Amazon offered the Magic Motion Remote free which makes using the Smart features a whole lot easier than using the TV remote. I tried both ways but the TV remote was tedious. The Magic Motion is like a wireless mouse except you point it at the screen and click. As others have stated the Magic Motion device has to be recalibrated (thats easy too) constantly because you find yourself pointing at the ceiling to move the pointer on the TV screen.

This is my first HDTV and I really like its large size and crisp picture. The internet applications give you the option of watching videos on Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, Blockbuster, youtube etc. However, I am a bit disappointed with these apps, mainly because:1) The video apps load very slowly. Once you start watching your video, you can keep watching it without interruption, but if you want to navigate through the app to search for other videos, it will be very slow.2) The youtube app is a huge disappointment. The search results are limited. You can not log into your youtube account and hence you lose the opportunity to watch your favorite videos.3) The web browser is practically useless, primarily because of its slow speed and its inability to play flash video. For example, you can't run videos from cnn.com .I would still give this TV five stars because it delivers great picture quality and basic internet features.

The TV was easy to set up, along with our Verizon FIOS digital box and Blu-Ray player. The TV walks you through it. Make sure that you have enough HDMI cables.The TV comes with LG's \"SmartTV\" apps loaded on, which includes the basics (Netflix, HULU, Facebook), but also allows for games. Additionally, the TV can function as a web browser. To use SmartTV, your house must have Wi-Fi or the TV must be connected directly to your router (which is what we did). This is as modern as a TV gets in 2011, as the functions of what TVs and home PCs do are increasingly merging. [This is why the cable TV industry is sweating bullets]. The only downside is that the remote control lacks a QWERTY keyboard, which means that navigating the internet can be a chore, i.e., \"pecking\" website addresses on the TV screen's keyboard. The magic remote functions like a Wii remote, which means that you can laser point and click on the screen to select keyboard letters. Not as easy as a proper keyboard, but it's doable. You can bookmark favorite websites so that you only have to do this once.In terms of picture quality, the TV is outstanding.

Best TV for the Money", "Author": "SLC", "ReviewID": "R1UJT9WQ591KFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We love our new LG 42\" 5400 HDTV!  The picture is fabulous and the controls and settings are straightforward and easy to use.  As another reviewer noted, we have the best TV of anyone we know!  At 42\" it is the perfect size for our smaller living room.We bought this TV over the Black Friday weekend for $649.99 with the free Magic Remote: a great deal and well worth the money. (The Magic Remote had to be added to the cart separately; we notice some people who purchased the TV during this time period did not get their remote because they didn't realize this--Amazon will likely correct this for you.)The TV itself was relatively light and easy to set up; we did not experience any dead pixel problems reported by other buyers.  It was generally easy to set up the TV, though we had some trouble connecting the WiFi initially.One disappointment for us: we can't access web video because the TV's capabilities do not extend past Flash 8.  So we can't access Flash websites or Hulu or YouTube; (just HuluPlus, NetFlix, etc.)In short, yo ucan navigate to websites from the TV but not view the web video on the websites.  Bummer!  It is not a dealbreaker for us--but something others should consider before purchasing this TV.On sum, we are THRILLED with the overall quality of this TV and give it 5 stars.  If you are buying this TV for use mainly as a TV & to access HuluPlus and NetFlix, you will love it.  If you want to access web videos, it won't work for that.On sum, this TV has exceeded our expectations in terms of picture quality and ease of use.

I had originally purchased an Insignia from a local Best Buy and was disappointed by the lag I experienced while gaming on my Xbox 360. I decided to return that TV and purchase this one from Amazon when it was offered for $679.99 as Black Friday special. It was the right decision, and surprisingly, this TV was cheeaper than the Insignia LED I had bought from Best Buy. I'm a technical guy and the specs on this TV are great.PROs include beautiful picture, excellent gaming performance (no judder/lag with TruMotion 120Hz on low), and good/sturdy design. It was easy to set up and the SmartTV rocks! Expert mode settings really give you control over almost every picture setting available. You can even stream media from your Mac/PC straight to the TV with a simple program install. It works great!CONs include overly large LG logo in the front and only 2 USB ports. I know that may sound weird, but the wireless usb adapter takes up one of the ports, and if you got the Magic Remote (I got it for free from Amazon), your second USB port will be taken up as well. They should have included a separate input for the Magic Remote.

For the price, it's probably one of the best LEDs available!", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG stands for...Lookin Good", "Author": "Simmer \"itsme0209\"", "ReviewID": "R2DJ2ZXIXZJG2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV primarily as an upgrade from 720p to 1080p and also because of its USB video playing capabilities. What a surprise it was to find out that this is the MOST AMAZING PICTURE I've seen out of any I've seen on display in the stores! WOW!!Are for all the features included, the price cant be beat.The top main features that make this TV amazingly awesome for me is:USB Video playing capabilities. I'm not 100% sure but it almost looks as if it also up converts videos using USB as well. They look amazing! However, it does not seem to play all files that were listed on Amazon's description. I had a few WMV and FLV files I was trying to play on the TV but they weren't even showing up in the list. So I renamed the files to AVI and they finally showed up in the list, but they still wouldn't play. It also seemed to be picky with similar files that would play as well, so if you are hoping  to throw any file at this TV and expect it to play, think again. But all in all, most TVs don't offer this option at all, so I can't complain.The MAGIC REMOTE that came free with my Amazon purchase (I LOVE YOU AMAZON!). This remote made my TV experience 10x better. Navigation with the standard remote was tedious and slow. The most useful feature of owning a magic remote is navigating time on a video. Click to the position of the movie you want to be and it will jump there. With the standard remote you are forced to press the Fast Forward button and wait endlessly while it reaches the point you want to go to in the video. This remote makes navigation easy for USB Video, Netflix and Network streaming.The magic remote makes movement and even selection so much faster. I will note however, that the functionality of the magic remote takes getting used to. I wouldn't exactly describe it as a Nintendo Wii controller, because the Wii controller always seems to know where you are pointing. The Magic Remote on the other hand seems more like a PC Mouse. When you get to the edge of the screen movement stops, and as soon as you start moving in the opposite direction again, the cursor moves as well, meaning that the point of the remote is not pointing exactly where the cursor is on screen. Hard to explain, but if you happen to get one you will immediately see what I am referring too. Not a deal breaker though as it is still 100x's better than the standard remote. But it would be nice if it was more like a Wii controller.DNLA Capabilities!! This is by far unexpectedly the best feature I have experienced with the TV. I wasn't even aware of this functionality nor did I plan on using it. I use this TV to stream videos using software called PLEX. It makes video selection very fancy and requires almost no work other than installing the program on your PC and selecting your videos folder. For DVD's that I copied to my hard drive, it will automatically go online and download all cover art, descriptions, information and display them very beautifully on the screen. The LG doesn't seem to hiccup much when using the network to play videos, but it has choked a few times on certain videos. But overall it has been pretty reliable.Netflix built in! Very nice feature, however, it seems a bit slower using the built in version compared to a PC or PS3. Also, the video quality looks better using my PS3 than it does through the TV. But all in all, I'd rather not turn my PS3 on for Netflix as it gets very hot after a while. So the built in version will do for the most part.Some minor annoyances of the TV I would say are the following:The on screen displays at times. When navigating through a video a good portion of the video is cut off to display the investigation bar and controls on screen. It would have been nice if they has some sort of transparent controls on screen so you could still see the video full screen. Especially when pausing. It goes away after a while, but it is still annoying at times.There is a popping sound when using my optical cable for my audio system. I am still not 100% sure if it is the TV itself yet. I have to run some test to find out. Has anyone else has experienced this...???Sometimes the APPs happened to be unavailable, such as Netflix. I think this might have to do with the software updates, but it happened on Thanksgiving when my family was over and I wanted to play a Netflix video. The app never became available again until hours after they left.The software updating itself seems to be a bit slow. I have a wired connection and Comcast cable so I would expect it wouldn't take long to update the firmware, but it took about 20 minutes last time I updated.All small annoyances that wouldn't oppose me to highly recommending this TV to anyone else!

I recently joined Amazon Prime and I have been receiving VIP shipping. I love it. I also just began using Amazon Instant videos that is part of my Amazon Prime membership. I watched an Agatha Christie TV program last night for free as a Prime member, just fantastic. It has been a great pleasure to deal with Amazon. I save money, get great service, and enjoy fantastic benfits. I look forward to a win-win business relationship.P.S. the LG TV is great. The picture is outstanding and the audio is acceptable. I have a wireless network in my home so I have been enjoying the \"Smart TV\" features of my new LG TV. I really like the ability to surf the Web right from my TV without having to tether my PC to the TV.Sincerely,Steve EnrightColumbus, OH", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "arrived on time.  open box.", "Author": "Gaseph", "ReviewID": "R2P55KNTV3J4UM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Fast fast shipping.  The TV arrived very quickly in a box that had seen better days.  The TV itself was in excellent condition, no scratches, no damage, great picture, low hours of use.  However, the stand for the TV was scratched all over it's surface.  The \"body\" of the stand (the part that connects the TV to the stand base) was not included in the box.  The TV was purchased to sit on a stand, not hung on the wall.  Therefore, the product was returned.  If all parts of the stand were included in the initial shipment, I would have been happy and kept the TV.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is a great TV, but as a smart TV it is just OK", "Author": "B.

I love that I can get HULU and Netflix.  However would like to see more offerings at that level.  That is where it ends.  I hope they add HBO Go and other premium apps that you can get with other streaming devices.  The apps are not even in the same realm of what I can get from other devices.  LG should really think about teaming up with some bigger names.Also, setup was fairly simple.  However several things I noticed that seemed off.  They send you a wireless network adpapter that takes up a slot in the back.  Not a big deal, but I would have expected this to be internal. It is internal on 2 of the other LG tvs, as stated in the \"universal\" set up guide.  The Motion remote that comes seperately, but I recieved free with the deal they had on Amazon also has an external attachment that needs to be velcroed to the TV.  They provide all of this, but this remote was made for this TV....again, just seemed like sloppy add ons.All in all, we like the TV and I felt the price was amazing.  I hope if LG is going to sell this as a high end TV to compete with Sony they should get in the ring and make some upgrades to the streaming choices.  They should also try to network with Android Apps Market or some other company that knows their apps.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Jolly", "ReviewID": "R1CSQH4ZV17X8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV was the one that had all that I wanted.

The picture quality is sensational!  The product arrived within 5 days of my order, and it only took me about 20-30 minutes and I had everything up and running.  I really liked my old HDTV (a Sharp Aquos 37-inch), but this TV is a noticable upgrade.  The colors, the background, etc., all look amazing.  It is truly fun to watch programs on this TV!As others have also written about, one thing to note is that there are some \"oddities\" with the 120 Hz refresh rate.  On this TV, there is a setting called Tru-motion.  If you are watching a sporting event, you'll want the Tru-motion turned on (which I assmume makes use of the higher refresh rate)--it makes the game look so real you will almost think you are there.  But, if you are watching a movie or TV show, you will want to turn the Tru-motion off--otherwise, the resolution is 'too good' and it appears that you are watching a camcorder recording of the show where it all looks \"cheesy.\"  Thankfully, turning the Tru-motion on and off is simple via the settings and can be done in a couple of seconds using the remote.I also tried out Netflix using the Smart TV connection (wireless through my wireless router), and it worked flawlessly.  If you want to use the other Smart TV options (such as the internet connection), I would highly suggest getting the special remote for that because the standard remote is very clumsy when using the Smart TV features.Overall, I couldn't be happier with this TV, especially when you consider the price!", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Like my LG", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R3VGB96U93OQAH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First large screen LED and very pleased.

Speak to representative who understands the problem and then tells me they will send a new base as soon as possible, but it may not arrive for 7-10 days!  I asked if the shipment could be expedited since a 7-10 day arrival would place me outside Amazon's 30 day return window.  He said he would note to expedite the part but gave me absolutely no assurance that they would actually do it.  I find this unacceptable customer service.

I am not an expert in LCD TVs by any means however, during the trials I experienced with my TV shopping over the last month; I feel that I am knowledgeable enough to leave a fair review.This is the 4th LCD TV that I have purchased over the last month. In all fairness, I will mention the other models I purchased so that others likely considering those models in addition to the LV5400 can get an idea of each TV's pros and cons.My first purchase was the Sony Bravia KDL40EX500. The TV was very aesthetically pleasing on my entertainment center. It has a nice look despite its larger thickness over the other models (it is CCFL backlit instead of LED) and the initial picture quality seemed great. I was shocked to discover that the TV had a dead pixel right out of the box. I was extremely disappointed being that it was a Sony, though I decided to live with it. I began noticing some backlight bleeding and uneven tones while watching various programs. I was surprised because I had understood that CCFL backlit TVs have minimal, if any backlight bleeding issues.I decided to purchase a Samsung TV (model UN46D6000) from a local retailer, because they were getting good overall reviews. I thought I would compare the Samsung and Sony, and then keep the one I liked best. The Samsung has a very nice and sturdy glass stand. Unfortunately, the Samsung was also disappointing. The Samsung had amazing and unmatched HD picture quality, however it suffered from terrible backlight bleeding (has LED backlight) in the screen's top corners. I did some research and discovered that Samsung TVs suffer from a \"panel lottery\" and the one I purchased had an inferior \"VA\" LCD panel as opposed to the better \"IPS\" panels (they install both types in the same TV models). The backlight bleeding was so annoying that I returned the TV.I read some good reviews on the Panasonic TC-L4230. I bought one from the same local retailer. I set it up and while I was cleaning the (dirty straight out of the box) screen, I noticed that the screen freely rattled within the frame/bezel. Despite the TV's good picture quality and alleged IPS panel, I could not live with a loose/rattling screen. I returned it to the store and while there, I noticed that the floor model also had a loose screen. In addition, the stand for the Panasonic does not swivel at all!Finally, we arrive at my review of the LG42LV5400. I almost decided to give this TV 4 stars based on my experiences with the other TVs. However I am reviewing this TV on its stand-alone performance therefore, it gets 3 stars.I ordered the TV from Amazon. Shipping was fast and the box was in good shape with only the usual types of box blemishes. The stand was easy to install and is relatively sturdy. My first gripe is the HDMI input locations. They are located on the left side (while facing the TV) so that when the cables are plugged in, they extend horizontally from the TV. Unfortunately, the input locations are close to the edge of the TV, therefore the cables stick out the side like a sore thumb. There is no way to adjust the cables so that they do not look goofy protruding out the side of the TV. It does have plenty of inputs. The TV immediately needed a software update, which took about 10 minutes to download. I then tried Netflix and it immediately prompted me to download another software update!! Two updates within 20 minutes! Netflix was relatively fast and had good picture quality. I put in a BLU RAY and was disappointed to discover backlight bleeding. Though it's not extreme backlight bleeding, it is still somewhat annoying. A month ago, I would have returned the TV, but I am sick of messing with different models, so I am living with this one. I have read that LG TVs suffer from the \"panel lottery\" similar to Samsungs.I fortunately received an IPS panel denoted by the AUSY letters in the model code. Some claim that it is a better TV than those with VA panels. The HD picture quality is not quite as good as that of the Bravia or Samsung, but it is still good. I am suspicious about the claimed contrast ratio though, because if I based a guess on my naked-eye perception, my assumption would be that the contrast ratio is no better than 100,000:1. Blacks are not very impressive. Viewing angles are good though that may vary depending on whether you get a TV with a VA or IPS panel. The menu is decent with a fair amount of picture options. As other reviewers have noted, it is possible to minimize the backlight bleeding by setting the picture to \"Game\" mode. I do not rate TV speakers/sound, because all newer TVs are made with poor sounding speakers. You need to invest in a decent soundbar or component audio system to get good sound with these TVs.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Non-Current Adobe Flash - Can Not View Most Web Based Videos", "Author": "Dabear", "ReviewID": "RW1TS4HMAWGLP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do NOT buy!
