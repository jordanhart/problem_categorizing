Happily for me I just want to watch TV and Blu-Rays, so sound was improved for movies by purchasing a Yamaha YAS sound bar and attaching to a \"smart\" Samsung Blu-Ray player, e.g. when playing movies the sound goes through the sound bar (make sure the TV sound is turned down to zero or there is an echo effect.) Perfect solution for me - the TV sound is perfectly fine when watching \"regular TV\" - just wanted rich sound when watching films. In any case, for movies IMO with a picture of this quality and set-up ease, I'd buy this TV again - re movies bigger is definitely better. Did spend some time in the Picture - movie mode tweaking settings (Movie mode darkens screen for viewing in a dark room so less glare/eye strain, roughly Brightness, Color set to around 50, Contrast 70-80, Dynamic Contrast set to Medium but all this depends on taste, and personal preferences). Worth reading manual! Very enjoyable watching movies more or less the way they were meant to be seen, \"big screen\", it's like seeing your DVDs etc. for the first time.  For me no real negatives, a swivel base would have been nice, and usual warnings about LED burn-in re letting static images sit on screen. Easy set-up, and again, wonderful picture.Edit Dec 2013 - thought I'd add a comment on the \"soap opera\" effect I was getting on multiple channels when watching regular cable TV - so did some reading - and went into the menus and turned anything connected w. led/auto motion OFF. Bingo, no more soap opera effect. (Tho supposedly this is the wave of the future for movies and TV). Added an article on this below, but there are many articles online besides these comments (e.g., it's not the TV, it's your settings - except the manual doesn't actually SAY turn this off if your Samsung TV picture looks like a soap opera...thank Gawd for the Internet and the tech people who post articles):\"Soap Opera Effect is the name for the look when an HDTV uses motion interpolation, making movies and TV shows look like cheap video, similar to a daytime TV Soap.The reason the effect is produced is complicated, what's important is that you can turn it off.First look and see if you can set the native refresh rate on your HDTV, if so set it to 60 Hz.  See how your TV show looks now.  If you can't set the refresh rate, or if the picture still look soap like, then go down to the next step.Each TV maker has a different name for Motion Interpolation.  Here is a list of what manufactures call it (or look up manual online).Sony - Motion FlowSamsung - Auto Motion PlusSharp - AquoMotionToshiba - Clear Frame or Clear ScanVizio - Smooth MotionLG - TruMotionSanyo - Smooth MotionCheck the manual that came with your TV, or dig into your TV's menu until you see the Smoothing settings.  Set the motion smoothing to low or off if you can.  Does your TV shows look better, I hope so.Some TV's also have a function called Theater mode, this may work well too!So what is a high refresh rate or motion smoothing good for you might ask?  They make fast moving video and video shot higher than 24 fps look better such as professional sporting events, blu-ray movies that use a lot of computer animation, and video gaming.\"", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not perfect, but a good deal for the price", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R1AWZPXGH3H7MF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had this TV for a few days now so I can't comment on how it holds up over time, but so far I really like it overall.  The picture quality is outstanding, as is the price for a TV this size (I got it for $999 at Best Buy).  We use it primarily for gaming and didn't need all of the latest bells and whistles.The reasons why I am not giving it 5 stars:- The sound is not so great - it is kind of hollow and tinny. I have another 5 or 6 year old Samsung that is maybe half a step above this one in terms of features and delivers a much deeper sound.- The base does not swivel.  I have read descriptions where it does indicate that it is a swivel stand, but as far as I can tell it is not.- The glare can be really bad.  Where we have it now there are not many windows so it is not an issue, but I was contemplating swapping it with the older Samsung that we have which is in a room with many windows, but the glare was so bad that I had to put them back.- There is no audio output jack.  This can be remedied with an A/V receiver (which can also compensate for the minimal amount of input jacks), however it would be nice if it had one.But all things considered, I am satisfied with this purchase.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture, Crappy Sound, No Sound Outputs", "Author": "Matt Gilbert", "ReviewID": "R1SK72HIJNGAZB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the quality of the picture, but extremely disappointed by the absence of any way to output the sound to a receiver.

I wanted a basic TV with a good picture and none of the \"fluff\" that comes with the \"smart\" tv models for less than 1k. My ROKU box handles all of the media streaming so I did not want to pay for the smart features. It's a 120hz panel so don't think you are getting a 240hz model because of the clear motion rate advertising 240. It will come set-up with all of the filtering and interpolation set high and it will have the \"soap opera\" effect. Don't worry it will go away if you adjust the settings. I have auto motion plus set on \"clear\", digital noise filter on \"auto\" and LED motion Plus set to \"on\" This seems to be the sweet spot where there is not too much DSP going on. Love the picture once it's set up properly. Like all new TV's there is no glare filter over the panel. My older tv's had them and it helped quite a bit. I was able to remove any glare simply by using a mount that angles the tv down slightly.  There are not many I/O points so if you don't do your HDMI switching with your receiver then I'd look at a different model. This TV can be found on sale for less than 1k and I found mine for $899 so don't pay more than $1k for it.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great after calibration", "Author": "Greg in Longwood", "ReviewID": "R32UQWXRI5DYT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to make a few notes here to give you some background before reading further.- My TV is mounted on a wall between two windows that face east. The middle of the screen is at 5'10\" height, so it's above eye level from the sofa. In the morning, the sun is very bright in the room, dimmer in the evenings and of course dark at night.- I used a receiver for all my audio and video switching. I also use a universal remote control. Thus, speaker quality, TV input/output options and the included remote mean nothing to me.- I am an IT pro with a decent base of technical knowledge, but I'm by no means an audio/video expert. I always look for a balance between performance and price. There is no way I'll ever pay more than $1000 for a big screen TV--never have, never will. And I don't dig through every specification of every TV... I find the TVs in my price range and go for the best of that bunch.Now, I love this TV. I didn't want to buy a Smart TV because I have a Roku, media center and satellite for any streaming and local media playback. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't pay a single penny more for a smart television because the streaming services will change over time, and I plan on keeping my TV for 7 years. For less than $100, you can buy a streaming device that is fully upgradeable and replaceable in the future. All I wanted was an 1080p screen with lots of acreage and of decent quality and that's what I got.The default settings on this TV are not atrocious, but are definitely not optimal. I followed the calibration steps from Lifehacker on my TV. It's been less than 24 hours and I know the settings may change due to \"burn-in\", so I'll recalibrate it in another few months to see if anything has changed. If you want to do the free calibration, just enter AVS calibration into your favorite search engine for the full method or use the Lifehacker article for ease. It takes a keen eye and familiarity with your TV settings, but doesn't take an engineer to improve from factory defaults.Below are the settings for my TV. Some will argue that I did something wrong, but I spent 90 minutes doing this and I am happy with the results. There is no perfect settings for all situations, and its really up to you what makes sense in your situation.My settings:Mode: StandardBacklight: 20 (yes, some of you will stop reading this after seeing that, but I like my whites to be white)Contrast: 45Brightness: 38Sharpness: 20Color: 70Tint: G38/R62Advanced settings:Color space: AutoWhite balance: left at 25 defaultGamma: +1Dynamic contrast: high (I use this because the brightness in my room varies a lot between morning and night.

I wish there was a button on the remote to turn this on/off with a single click)LED Motion: Off (dimmed the picture and would require recalibration to enable)", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV.

We eagerly awaited the arrival from the moment we placed the order. There were some issues with the shipping that were beyond the control of the shipping company (when we checked the tracking it stated there was a train derailment, and continued to state that for several days) so we begrudgingly accepted that it would not likely arrive when expected, and when it did it may be damaged and need to be returned and replaced. We double checked because it was being shipped via a company we had never heard of before, and discovered that the TV was NOT in the train derailment at all, but was sitting at a shipping company on the other side of our state, with no address on the package, and no phone number listed??? (I get text message updates, and they were turned on for this item as well.)

The other big part was that the TV is properly back-lit; it's not edge-lit like the super thin TVs of today. Keep in mind that this model uses slightly older technology, but this is a perfect example of the old saying, \"they don't make 'em like they used to.\"Considering its price, it deserves 5 stars. Color representation is good, and easily adjustable, although not as good as the $5k+ displays. The 120hz refresh rate is, in fact, 120hz, so you won't get any judder from 24 FPS Blu-Ray playback. But, unlike the $5k displays, it's not 240hz, so no 3D playback. The speakers are good enough for a bedroom, but in this day and age, if you're buying a 60 inch display and plan to use the built-in speakers, then there's something seriously wrong with your priorities.*ALL* image processing can be disabled, including backlight dimming, motion smoothing, blur reduction, etc. This is great, because a lot of the time, these \"enhancements\" make some material look quite strange. One good thing, however, is that turning all motion smoothing off, but turning Judder Reduction to just one tick above zero actually does work 90% of the time without causing the dreaded Soap Opera Effect. This is especially useful while streaming Netflix movies that should be 24 frames per second, but Netflix has dubbed it to 30 FPS, causing judder.The entire purpose of this TV is to provide a good picture quality and decouples you from any one \"smart\" setup. Using this display simply as a monitor is the way to go. You maintain the freedom of switching to any set top box, blu-ray player, or otherwise \"smart\" device and the TV just remains simple.So, do keep in mind that I've rated this TV based on its price.

I do think though, with another appliance such as this, I am not going to take the chance with shipping, and I will just buy locally.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "After analyzing the price/features this is the one!", "Author": "Sandra P Bass", "ReviewID": "R1YXJOY58SK8UQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have done much research on all of the big tv's available and first settlrd on Samsung as the brand to go after. I didn't want 3D or Wi-Fi so it wasn't easy finding this model with just the features that I wanted. It is on it's way and I hope it gets here soon so that I can experience what it has to offer and see it for myself. I could not find any reviews for this specific model (un60eh6003) but if it is similar to the un60es6003 it should be a great tv. It is $200 cheaper than the ES model so perhaps it doesn't have the full array led backlighting. If I am not satisfied with the picture when I recieve it I will return it to get the ES model instead. Stay tuned for further review after I recieve it and play around with the settings to tweak the picture and sound to my satisfaction.Samsung 60\" Class 1080p 120Hz LED HDTV", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,299.00", "Features": "1080p HDTV : Better picture quality\n120Hz Refresh Rate: Better for general viewing and good for video games, action movies, and sports\nTV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 54.1 X 31.5 X 3.7 Inches, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 54.1 X 33.9 X 12.9 Inches", "Name": "Samsung UN60EH6003 60-Inch 1080p 120Hz HDTV (2013 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419bFLtN3AL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00A9HDXOY"}}
