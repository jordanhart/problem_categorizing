Skin tones look great too.  The motion smoothness is at least as good as other 120 hz sets I've watched.  Sports look so much better on this TV than on my 2010 47\" Sharp, actually every DirectTV HD channel looks better on this TV than the Sharp.We are especially happy with the NetFlix interface.  We were expecting a crude and basic functionality (like our Sony BluRay player which is just painful to use).  We like the Vizio app even better than our Roku HD rig.  Much better.  Smooth and snappy response to your inputs, scroll through your queue, search, and recommended movies.  Takes just a few moments to buffer your selection and you are good to go.  NetFlix HD movies look fantastic in LCD/LED.  Saved $60-$80 on a second Roku box, and Vizio works better too!Have not messed around with the Amazon movie app too much, other than setting up access, and that part went very well.Accessing our WiFi was a piece of cake.  Choose your home network and enter your password, you're done.  The setup guidance took care of everything.Bought this TV at Costco.

FOR 37\" & 47\" ONLY", "Author": "Brice S.", "ReviewID": "R18I355A06UMUZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Read the bottom for the final update that changed the review from 5 stars to 2.So let me first start off by saying this. Never, never buy a flat screen tv online. They usually do not have the same warranties that in stores do. I usually always buy off Amazon and other online avenues, but I know tv's like these can bite the dust at anytime. I bought mine at Costco because this tv comes with a 2 year warranty and with a 3 year additional warranty for just $30. So I ended up buying this tv for less and have a 5 year warranty. These warranties usually apply at most warehouse and department stores.Now, on to the actual tv review. I've had this tv for a couple weeks and I have been very pleased. The Neflix app is amazing and comes in HD (1080) (which I note because if you are currently using your Playstation (720) or Wii (480) this does not appear in HD). The menus and functionality are awesome too. Oh, and the sound is great too. The sound really packs a punch for such a razor thin tv. Paired with the the HD package I have with my cable company this is just pure heaven while watching tv. I'm giving this a very fair 5 out of 5 because it deserves it.Again, I do recommend this TV whole heartedly, but please be smart and buy any TV at a reputable vendor that offers a really good warranty. These newer TV's are great but they are notorious for biting the dust. Amazon may be the cheapest but their warranties don't go far. Save yourself the heartbreak later and buy the warranty, and make sure the warranty is backed by a good retailer.Warranty + This particular TV = Awesome Sauce*******UPDATE*******So I actually was so impressed with my 370sl (37\") model that I actually talked my wife into letting me buy the 470sl model (47\"). Both models are superb. The picture is amazing and the apps are awesome. Plus both these models are very affordable (I bought both at Costco due to their awesome warranties and return policies) I fully recommend both these models. Oh and by the way, no I am not a fake review by some ad agency. I too hate it when bogus reviews falsely praise crappy products, but you can rest assured that these two tvs (370sl and 470sl) completely are legit. Just in case though, always check reviewers by their past reviews. Hope this helps anyone. Cheers!******FINAL Update****Sadly after buying both the 370sl and 470sl models both had a flaw that made me cringe. Both the models volume controls crap the bed. I loved both these tv's because they had the very best picture available in my opinion. My 37\" volume started going up and down during programs, mainly during apps like Netflix. Then it started happening to the other one. Then it started happening while watching cable. I did some research and found out that it is kind of common with these models. I'm really bummed because I thought these tv's were amazing. After working with Vizio on the phone with a firmware update they said they could send someone out. I declined due to the fact that I had already read 3 reviews where this had been a problem and even the techs were unable to fix it. I decided that maybe these were a bad omen of things to come. I returned both tv's and bought a higher priced Samsung. After making the switch I now know why Samsung has a higher price tag. Samsung far surpasses Vizio in every way, except apps. The apps on Vizio can't be beat. Vizio's interface is ultra fast processing apps. I'd say the apps are Vizio's best selling point. I don't want to get into comparisons between Samsung and Vizio, because I don't feel people read these reviews to hear about other products. Also, I think Vizio is a great company and I don't want to bash on them. Sometimes these things happen. In my case it happened twice.In conclusion, I would do some research on these models. I found that this specific model has had the same problems with fluctuating volumes. The rep at Costco also said that I was not the first person to return these model tv's with the same problem. I hope anyone that buys this has better luck than I did. I love Vizio. I have owned 4, not including these and been extremely happy. Anyways, hope you can see how things started great with these tv's but soon went down hill. Oh well, I'm happy with my Samsung.......for now. I'm giving this tv 2 stars and not one because it is unfortunate that such a great tv, with great apps and picture quality, had to have such a flaw.

Defintely recommend this TV. 55\" is awesome!", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding TV: Excellent quality at a reasonable price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RP7C9ONTCE4J4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did serious research prior to buying this TV--including a spreadsheet with prices and features. Budget was a crucial factor, so getting the most for my money was the goal. I was replacing a 55\" Samsung DLP and didn't want to go any smaller. I definitely was focused on LED backlit or edge-lit as opposed to LCD without any back lighting. (There is a less expensive Vizio model that is LCD only.) After reading dozens of reviews, and comparing prices online and in brick and mortar stores, I came to the conclusion that I did want a smart TV, didn't want to go with plasma given the potential glare, and wanted to be able to do a fair amount of tweaking of the settings. No, I'm not a video expert, but I did order a calibration disc (WOW-Disney), which was educational and helpful. I also wanted a TV with 4 HDMI inputs as I have several components to connect.SETUP and INPUTS: The setup steps were easy to follow. I had no trouble integrating the VIZIO into my 7.1 home theater setup which is built around an ONKYO amplifier, and includes DirecTV DVR, HD-DVD, Blu-Ray and a Google TV box (which is a bit redundant with a smart tv, but on the other hand, it's useful for web surfing). Having 4 HDMI inputs on this TV allowed for a somewhat easier configuration. I also have the option of plugging in a USB device to show photos or other content on the TV.WIRELESS: I really appreciate the built-in wireless. I connected the TV to my network with no difficulty. The TV streams content from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube much faster than my SAMSUNG Blu-Ray.REMOTE: Although the QWERTY keyboard is small, it is functional. Personally, I prefer the wireless Logitech Revue keyboard if I want to do any serious searching. The best feature of the remote for me is having dedicated buttons for Netflix and Amazon streaming. This works quickly, and content streams beautifully. I DO wish they'd made the remote a bit larger. It fits easily on the palm of the hand, but I wouldn't have minded one that was an inch or two longer to accommodate bigger buttons and bigger labels. There is also a dedicated button for changing the screen format (size) without going into settings. This allows you to ZOOM in to movies that are letter-boxed or pillar-boxed so that the image fills the screen edge to edge, but naturally you will lose some of the image content around the edges, and the 'wide' setting is not appropriate for some content as it makes people look, well, too wide.PICTURE: I am delighted with the picture quality, so I don't understand the reviews that criticize it, but again, I'm not a tech expert. All I know is that everything looks good. Obviously HD content is the best, but it also manages to make SD programming look good, even 50-year-old episodes of Perry Mason. I watch football and did not see any smearing or blurring during fast action. There are a number of pre-sets (movies, various sports, etc.) which users can choose instead of tweaking individual settings. This TV also switches effortlessly between types of content as you change channels, switching from full-screen to pillar-box as needed (for older SD content).SOUND: I only listened to the sound briefly, but it was good considering that there is a limit to the size of the speakers in flat panel TVs. Still, obviously sound is much, much better with surround sound speakers, or at least a sound bar.OPTICAL AUDIO Output: I mention this because it enable me to input four devices to the TV and then output all the sound to one of my amplifier's optical audio inputs. This eliminated the need to use the Onkyo remote to change devices (to 'listen' to the correct input).AESTHETICS: This TV has a nice form factor, is quite thin, with a narrow frame that is very unobtrusive.VALUE: Though I buy many items from Amazon, I bought the set at Costco for $839 on Black Friday. Adding in the extended 3-year Square Trade Warranty (special offer $59 for Costco members), plus tax, I spent about $965. If I'd been able to spend another $140 that day, I might have opted for the 60\" class Vizio, but this 55\" still just perfect for the viewing location, and I could move it and set it up by myself, which is a plus. I could not have found all the features I wanted in SONY, Panasonic, or Samsung models at the same price point, and though I viewed them all in the store (not an ideal setting), I didn't see enough difference to justify spending more. As far as I'm concerned, Vizio is not necessarily a \"lesser\" brand, and I couldn't be happier with my new M550SL.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "This TV Rocks!", "Author": "Mari B.

I've got a couple of other vizios (smaller screen)for bedroom & exercise area which I have been pleased with so decided, 'why not.'This TV was easy to set up and connection to my wireless system simple.  And, when I say simple, I mean simple as I am 66 years old and didn't have any problems whatsoever other than a weak signal from my router--it connected anyway--which I cured with a wireless extender (also purchased from Amazon;  signal strength increase by 40%).The picture is amazing and this vizio works flawlessly with netflix streaming  (haven't tried amazon yet but will).I have read some critical reviews of this product as it relates to the sound quality.  I didn't notice any issues with the sound but on second day of use, upgraded existing sound system (which was also 13 years old) with the use of a consultant (older onkyo receiver with 5.1 dolby with speakers being wired through walls ) and used a onkyo receiver (414) with current speakers. I asked the consultant about the sound issues and his response was 'with flat screens not going to get as good audio as before';  don't know if this is true across the board but made sense to me.  In any event, the audio if fine but that is with a separate sound system.Only thing I have to say critical about this TV is with remote.  Keyboard on back side but its next to worthless due to small keys for imput.  Could be my eyesight but don't think so.  So, don't count on this keyboard surfacing the internet.  Save yourself some frustration and go with the on screen keyboard when appropriate.I also have HD tvs made by Samsung and Toshiba.  Both are good TVs but vizios are the best ,so far, as it relates to receiving value for ones money.I really did not intend this review to be a commercial for vizios (they could fail tomorrow...who knows) so just calling it as I see it from my perspective.

Costco had a Vizio 42\" for $500 which I thought was a good deal.  However, I stumbled on a display model for 47\" M470SL which had it all over the 42\".  The clincher was I wanted a TV that I could hook up to my existing wall hanger & the 42 was not the same.  I would have to buy a new wall hanger.So I went for the gusto, the 47, with a new wall hanger.Tried it out before I hung it up to make sure it worked, when I got it home.Every thing works fine.  I'm 75 & have a hard time with tiny keys.  That was a point against Vizio.  The other point is, although it has a very good SRS system, I could not adjust the treble or bass levels to suite my hard of hearing.  Therefore, 4 stars, instead of 5.I won't watch it much.  I bought it for my wife & she loves it.  She's a Netflixer, so will see if she takes advantage of that connection.

However, watching the demo in the store, I did not see clearly the girl doing jumping jacks.  Her arms were blurry to me.I'm sure my wife will be very very happy with it.  I am content with Vizio &, the other big factor was paying $60 for a 3 year warranty on top of the 2 year.  So 5 years?  Wow.  Now if the set craps out in less than 2 years, then, I blew $60.

I'll admit I was hesitant to buy a Vizio, but had heard good things from some friends of mine so I decided to give it a go.First off, the picture is VERY good. Colors are great, blacks are very black, and the picture is very clear, especially when playing a Blu-ray.Second, the sound is AMAZING. The SRS sound truly does make a difference. I've always had problems with my LG LCD tv in that I can't ever hear what people in movies/shows are saying because their voice is the same volume level as the show's background noise. This SRS audio brings important sounds to the front and I am finally able to hear. It also does give off a noticeable \"surround sound\" type effect, especially for video games.Now, some dislikes.I dislike that Vizio advertises it as a 120hz television- it is not. It is 120hz SPS, which means it is a 60hz television (panel) with software in it to bring it up to what Vizio deems as 120hz (whatever criteria that might be, I don't know). With that, however, I have not noticed any motion blur whatsoever and it is comparable to my LG TruMotion 240hz television which is actually a 120hz panel with software to make it 240hz (see a trend?).A downside of the SRS sound is that, occasionally, I have noticed fluctuation of the sound during shows. It sounds as if the software is unable to decide which sound it should bring to the front, so it bounces back and forth. I have experienced this only once and only for about 2 minutes, but I did notice it. I'm assuming that these negative reviews are referring to that effect which, I'm assuming, can be corrected by turning SRS off (but then the sound goes back to all being the same level, leaving it hard to hear).All in all, so far, the pros outweigh the cons and it is a GREAT tv for the price. Wifi, apps (netflix, pandora, hulu, skype, etc) are all just a plus and icing on the cake.If my opinion changes, I will post", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bifurcated review: Good HDTV, assembly mistake and ineffective support.", "Author": "dan combs", "ReviewID": "R3M1F8HHA12MFE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First what i like and why i gave this 4-stars:1. The picture is excellent2. Functions are good, although requiring some work to incorporate into home theater system, universal remote, etc.Second, why i would have given this 1-star if i had rated this on the day i received the Vizio HDTV.  The delivery guy hardly had time to jump out of the way of the slamming door as i rushed to unwrap the HDTV and set it up.  I moved the previous  smaller TV into a bedroom, had everything on the home theater opened up and ready to install the new Vizio.  As I moved it into place i discovered that it was slightly bigger than the published dimensions, so i made accommodations for that difference.  No big deal.  The next problem appeared when i tried to plug in the HDMI connectors.  The connectors or the cover plate had been incorrectly installed so that none of the cable connectors could be inserted into their receptacles.  This led to an hour's worth of work trying to figure out why i couldn't insert an HDMI plug into a slot, under the assumption that i was doing something wrong.  After dropping the erroneous assumption i realized the problem was with the HDTV assembly.I searched for VIzio technical diagrams, but could not find anything detailed enough to inform me as to how the offending shield was installed or if it was adjustable.  I called Vizio support.  I wanted the information about fixing the problem.  The call to Vizio support led to walking through their script and their set of assumptions that someone else had caused the problem, i.e. was the box damaged, etc., answer: no, before we ended up  at the point where i was to rebox the set, send it back to Vizio, and await its replacement or return.  There was supposed to be a follow up email with instructions which as far as i can tell has never arrived.After a few minutes pondering the work involved and likely result of sending the HDTV back and waiting for a replacement I used a metal cutter to cut portions of the metal shield out of the way (this took a couple of minutes as i was being extra cautious) and was then able to insert the HDMI cables easily.  The set works well and looks good as long as no one looks too closely at the HDMI connector area.I understand the issues of running a support operation, but the inability to veer from the script or promote to a second tier, led to what would have been a lot of work, disruption, and dissatisfaction, had i had to rebox the TV, send it back and wait for a replacement.

It is also a great TV for the money and so far, after about 1 year, it continues to work well.  The main thing to remember when buying a Vizio TV, (or any other brand of TV), is to buy your TV from a dealer authorized by the manufacturer.  If you don't buy from an authorized dealer you will not have a manufactures warranty.  An unauthorized/3rd party dealer may sometimes charge more than an authorized dealer for the same TV, because 3rd party dealers may buy retail (even at a store like Costco), then resell at higher price.  There are many 3rd party sellers online (some may claim to be authorized, but may not be), as well as real authorized dealers.  Some 3rd party resellers might make you think there is a manufactures warranty, but in fact there is not. Remember, only Vizio authorized dealers sell a TV with a Vizio manufacturers warranty.  Some 3rd party sellers may charge you all the shipping charges, plus a high restocking fee, just to return a TV if it is defective, and not even your fault.

The only item that looked like it might have been used was the remote.One of the main reasons I purchased it was the sub-35\" width fit exactly into my built-in entertainment center, and that worked out perfectly.Pros:Lightweight, Size, Sharp picture and bright colors.  120hz refresh rate makes a noticeable difference when watching football. Sound volume and quality is also very good for a TV this thin.  Netflix, Vudu integration is excellent, and saves you having to use an extra remote.Cons:We did experience the 'volume fluctuation' issue on the second or third day where it would get louder and quieter.  I believe this is due to the 'dynamic audio' feature which alters the volume based on the room noise.  We turned off the 'dynamic volume', and that went away, but the volume was not nearly as loud, so we turned it back on and the problem hasn't returned.  One other minor peeve, is that it takes a little longer to get into netflix, because have to wait for the TV to come on to start Netflix.  With my separate Roku box and two remotes, I could start them both at the same time and they would come up almost together.  Plenty of HDMI inputs, but doesn't have separate RCA Video and Component inputs so i can't have my older DVD player and Wii hooked up at the same time.Overall, this is a great TV if you are space limited, and can get it under $360 for this older model.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Refurb review", "Author": "BigRed", "ReviewID": "R1C2IUNT2LARZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed to replace an ~20 year old 20\" tube tv in a bedroom.  I was not going to spend a fortune on a tv.  My options were getting limited with some of the \"great\" deals on 60Hz LCD tvs.  I know Vizio is not one of the best brands, but it is better than Quantum, Hisense, Colby, and some of the other garbage brands.  This tv was $60 more than I wanted to spend, but I got LED and a SmarTV.I got this tv for $359 delivered.  The delivery was fast and I was apprehensive when the box it came in was pretty trashed.  I took the TV out, did a thorough inspection of the external portion of the TV.  No scratches or marks except for something on the back.  No care there since it was to be hung on the wall.  It was a small white scratch/paint mark.  Nothing that would take away from the TV.  I set the TV up to my DirecTV receiver, ran through the setup, and was running in about 10 minutes.  The long setup was due to having to register, connect with my WIFI, and general setup.  I thought the remote was supposed to be the one that slides for the keyboard.  It was not which made setup take so much longer by using the direction buttons to enter data.  Once running, I had no problems connecting with DirecTV, NetFlix, or Hulu Plus.  I just wish the remote had a Hulu Plus button instead of VuDu and the other one.All in all, this is an excellent TV.  The purpose is not for primary watching so I have done no calibration adjustments.  The sound is more than enough for the bedroom.  My 6yo daughter is able to navigate to Netflix easily to find something to watch.  Now I don't have to watch the same Disney or Nick re-runs over and over and over.Pros:$359 is a great price for an LED 120Hz tvSmarTVExcellent picture and quality for a secondary TVCons:Remote does not have the slide up keyboardEntering data becomes a pain with a direction padThree smart buttons on the remote are dedicatedI would not have a tv of this size for a primary TVOwnership time:  5 days.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good picture-smart apps need work", "Author": "M.

Bought at the beginning of last summer and it has yet to disappoint. I wanted something good on a budget and Vizio is the way to go by far for budget shopping with quality. The apps work great. There are only two issues that I have come across and I don't believe they warrant dropping a star. First, on occasion, and I mean rare occasion, the TV freezes when I'm turning it off. This has only happened a few times over the last year, and it usually shuts off on its own after a few minutes of being frozen. And then turns back on perfectly the next go. To me, negligible. Others may disagree, but hey this was a bargain. You can't expect a work of the gods! Plus, a little kink adds some character. Second, the sound dropping issue I have read about. It did happen to me. But honestly, no joke, it has only happened once or twice when I was watching Family Guy on Netflix. That's not bad statistics considering I've had the thing for over a year. Also, I don't turn the TV sound up much anyway as I have a better sound system in tow. But perhaps I'm just one of the lucky ones. We'll see if that continues.

I notice motion blur or tv lag especially on my old 60hz samsung. It wasn't as bad as I have seen on other TVs but I know most 120hz tvs reduced or eliminated that effect that some people see.This TV definitely does. I had recorded the SuperBowl and figured I'd watch that as a good test. No blur, running backs, passes, background crowds, - no pixelation or blur.I put on a baseball game in 1080i HD. It looks excellent!Movies - I hate the pan and scan look. It looks unnatural/fake. I like watching movies in letterbox. The 3D tv that was displayed next to it had that pan and scan look on everything. Not on just 3d shots. I was watching the same feed next to one another and the 3D tv definitely had a weird fake, cartoon like motion to the images.This TV does not have that Pan and Scan look to everything. (We were watching one of the Madagascar movies and the detail is awesome)I put on a few HD movies and even an old movie that it up-converted and it looked very good. Even the up--converted movie looked very good on a large screen.The remote is nice but it had problems receiving. I am not sure if it was the batteries or just because the sensor is in a weird location. You have quick buttons that allow you to jump to the apps. It also allows you a one button screen size adjustment which is nice. On the opposing side of the remote it has a QWERTY keyboard. pretty cool little addition. Now if I can get rid of my bulky DirectTV remote!I have a ROKU box but this tv pretty much makes it useless now.You have Netflix and other TV apps. (for some reason they use Yahoo! though which was a big mistake).Pandora, YouTube, etc.I do wish they had more apps. I couldn't find VIVEO which is nice to actually watch music videos (remember what those are?)It has wireless and wired internet. Took me all of 3 minutes to set up the wireless.Worked smooth.It has USB connections. I have to read more about this and edit this review but I only got the TV to recognize images and music. It locked up when I tried video. Not sure if it has a limit on HDD capacity or file size/type.

It was installed Christmas 2012 and has given us no issues so far.  The picture is excellent and the sound is acceptable (you really can't be too picky about the sound coming out of a 1.8\" thick device).  I'd definitely install some surround speakers with it, but let's be honest....if you're buying a 47\" TV, you can afford good speakers!The interface is easy and the keyboard remote is excellent.  Netflix works without a hitch and viewing photos from a USB drive or through direct HDMI connection to a computer is really easy.  The included remote is bluetooth so you don't have to have line of sight to make selections.  The TV will also accept IR remote controls, such as a digital cable remote so consolidation of remotes is easy.Streaming media from a computer is possible, but not great.  I believe this is a lack of processing power and RAM on the part of the TV.  Although, just like the speakers, you're probably not hooking this up to a VCR and will likely get a bluray player....most of which have streaming from PC capabilities.  While you're at it, just get a ps3 and then you're good to go!The only drawback I have noted thus far is that to use Skype, you have to purchase a Vizio brand camera attachment, which is expensive ($100+).  Because this is only a software issue, I would really recommend to Vizio that they open up the options to allow basic webcam installation.  Vizio is not a cheapo brand, but it does happen to be the lowest cost in almost every category, so the buyers tend to be value conscious.

While they do have many options, sometimes there can be to many to where it gets confusing. So I got info on features and tech specs then I left. I went into Costco and ran across this Visio M370SL. It had all the specs I wanted for $499. A similar TV at Best Buy was $799. I'm impressed with it! It has a great picture, and good apps. I have a Amazon Prime membership. There are 3 quick access buttons at the top of the remote. One for Amazon Prime then Netflix then Vudu. Amazon could do better with their interface but Netflix has a nice one. Yes the sound isn't top quality but I dont expect much out of two 10 watt speakers. Many other similar TV's have the speakers in the back. This one has them in the front at the bottom.I purchased it for my bedroom. In the store it looked like a perfect size TV for a bedroom. When I got it home it looked enormous! But there isn't a 32\" that I could find with these features. My only issue with this TV is that there is a slight hum that comes from the back bottom right corner. It goes away if I have it set to vivid. But if I watch it on that setting my eyes are bloodshot the next morning. As another reviewer recommended, upgrade to the remote with the qwerty keyboard on the back of it. The remote it comes with, its kinda tedious having to arrow over to letters when trying to type in a search. I dont get why this unit didn't come with the qwerty remote.So I do recommend the Visio M370SL if your considering it. Costco offers a 5yr extended warranty for $29. You cant beat that. For people that like to use skype, its on this TV. And when purchasing a wall mount you might have to buy longer screws because the screw holes on the back of the TV sit in a little recessed.

This feature is supposed to flatten out the sound of loud commercials, but I noticed that it was also affecting regular programing.  If the service person had recommended turning off this feature to fix the problem, they'd have been admitting a design flaw (or maybe were unaware of such a flaw).Incidentally, Vizio is the only brand I know that has a Lip-synch adjustment in the user menu. I've found this handy when watching certain movies when the sound is slightly out of synch (this seems to be a particular problem with PBS). Audio is processed faster than video, and if the source doesn't compensate, you get a split-second lag.  Once you notice this, it's hard to watch people whose lips don't quite match the sound of their spoken words. A few DVDs have the same problem.

I spent several hours on the phone with Vizio, who sent me to Netflix, who sent me back to Vizio, etc. In the end, it turns out that Vizio is responsible for updating and maintaining this App, and they are doing a very poor job.I don't have an antenna, I don't have cable, I have Netflix. Currently, I have to relaunch the Netflix App up to 10 times to get it to connect. All the other apps work fine; Amazon, Youtube, etc. If you are planning on using Netflix with your internet enabled TV, then DO NOT GET THIS ONE. Vizio dropped the ball here. I will update this review if they come through with an update that fixes the problem.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Total piece of crap!", "Author": "ametrinel", "ReviewID": "R3CK07QAR23CNI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV for the first time about 3 weeks ago. After 1 1/2 weeks, we had to take it back because the sound kept going in and out. I know sometimes TV shows/movies have sound issues where you have to keep adjusting the sound, but this was on every program, whether it was a network show, recorded DVD or Netflix streaming. We took it back and got another one of the same kind, thinking it was just a fluke. Nope. Today, after having the second TV of the same type for a week, the sound just went completely out. No sound, nothing. We are taking it back and never buying another Vizio again. Piece of crap! On the upside, the Netflix streaming was extremely easy to get to - loved the Netflix button on the remote, but not worth trying it again.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its a good tv", "Author": "Lola", "ReviewID": "R8IYDSDR0SH0C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "all the bells and whistles are here.  except the tv side of the remote doesnt work.  otherwise love it and would recommend it.feb 20, 2013HEY, DOESNT CUSTOMER SERVICE READ THIS?

Picture quality fair.  Amazon app provided (3.4.8) does not allow subtitles (CC).  If you need subtitles you can only use the Netflix app but then you must have an account with Netflix. Probably a good idea as Netflix is superior to Amazon Prime especially for CC. Sound quality on low volume poor, then as volume is increased it get better.

It is so potent, that after a couple of hours I have to leave the room.  My voice is getting raspier, the longer I am around it, and I have a hard time breathing when I am around it.  My daughter has been coughing and so has my husband.  We don't have a cold.  You can smell the TV only when it is on.  You can smell it about 20 feet away when it is on.The last time I had this happen to an older panasonic TV, the TV burst into flames and obviously I had to return it.I am real confused because our other Vizio we bought 3 years ago does not do this.  It is the eco version and it never smelled.What is this world coming to?The picture is great though.
