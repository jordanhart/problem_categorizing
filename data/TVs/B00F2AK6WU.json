As an addition it has built in speakers and tv tuner.  Speakers could be better but I have no problem with them at all.  Works great and fits on my Ergotron LX", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Looks good, but honestly should cost less.", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R3OGLR50236BD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I paid ($457, new from Amazon) for this monitor a couple months ago, and I'll say I'm happy with it so far.I like the TV. I don't use it much, but it's there when I want to watch TV in PIP when I'm working on something on my PC.You can adjust the transparency of the PIP window which is pretty cool, too.I never noticed before but the color on this is very good. I've never noticed how vibrant a monitor could really be until I plugged this one in from the PC input on HDMI.I was turned off on this when I found out it was not a bezzleless design, as shown in Amazon's picture. There is indeed a border but it's not a plastic molding, which makes it a bit more acceptable.It comes with a remote so you can adjust the volume if you're laying in bed across the room.One thing I don't like is the delay when I switch to PIP. It has to refresh the entire monitor to turn PIP on or off, so whatever you have working on your PC will flash away for a good 3 seconds.The side-by-side feature is only good if you're using a PC resolution that is literally a vertical rectangle, because when you use it, the monitor squeezes whatever resolution you use (I use the full 2560x1080) into half of the screen, making it impossible to read.They could have at least made the monitor report the proper resolution to the PC, hopefully via a firmware update one day.All in all, I'd buy another one of these, but not now seeing as though the price went up to $499.This monitor has features, but not enough to justify a price tag that just increased.So this is the first time I'm considering to buy a used one to get what I want.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not an edge to edge display", "Author": "V. Matthews", "ReviewID": "R3MI4RD9MJ2EH2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "One of the main selling points of this Monitor/TV was that I though it had a bezelless design, as indicated by Amazon's photo. This is not the case. The bezel is internal and it is the same size as any other monitor.Other than that, the monitor is OK. The colors are accurate and the controls are intuitive. You're going to get black bars if using certain applications such as Netflix. Alternatively, my personal video collection is great when being played from mpc-hc because of the flexibility in resolutions and zoom.For this price, I would recommend buying 3 16:9 monitors instead.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Display.", "Author": "M.

The Picture In Picture function however is not complete, only the coax cable and displayport inputs can be used as a sub input. This leaves you limited to the options available for PIP. The software you can install is not as useful as it could be, if they released new firmware that enabled HDMI and DVI as a sub-input I would give this a 5 star rating.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Listing mis-represented actual product", "Author": "r2rm", "ReviewID": "R38E8X4CWLD40A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received LG  IPS LED 29\" 1080p Ultra Wide MonitorThis was not the LED HDTV as advertised.NOT AS ADVERTISED", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "LG widescreen TV/Monitor", "Author": "William Garban", "ReviewID": "R1W1Y24VQZENP4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Red Hue adjust is backwards.

For that price, you may as well just get a 32\" 1080P LED with 120hz, 3 hdmi inputs, and SMART features too. The 32\" will be bigger also, so its a better deal, but not that this isn't a good tv tho. it's just way overpriced.
