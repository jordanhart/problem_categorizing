It is the first 19 inch LCD TV that we have seen with an integrated ATSC tuner which is what we needed. You can't beat the price because last years 19\" LCD was slightly more expensive and did not include the tuner. Futhermore this TV has excellent picture. Although the contrast ratio is not as high as the 23\", surprisingly it has a higher resolution, 1440x900 as opposed to 1366x768. Having both a PC input as well as HDMI is also a major plus. I also own an older samsung HDTV and there have been several nice improvements sine then. For instance as you change channels it displays the signal type (e.g. 1080i) which wasn't the case with my older TV. It also has all sorts of timers you can set which is perfect for the bedroom. We are using this TV as our alarm clock. Great TV!", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Finally HD Tuner in the small Samsung", "Author": "Curtis R.

Has an integrated HDTV tuner and all the connections you will need.  Looks sweet, too.  However, I got one off Amazon which was a dud.  Poor picture quality and white light bleed from the top and bottom of the screen (a problem another customer complained about).  Samsung telephone service help was great and agreed it was defective.  Amazon was terrific and paid for the return and refund.  Be careful with this set and wait a little for other feedback.  Oh, one annoying feature.  While the HDTV tuner works well, you cannot dial in a specific digital channel (like 10.1) unless the search program has previously found it.  And there is no way to \"save\" the found digital channels so that you can reposition the antennae, search for signals again, and then have a compiled list channels locked into the memory.  In other words, if your search found 10.1 in one antenna position but not 6.1, there is no way the TV will let you dial in 6.1 even if you reposition the antenna optimally.  You must then reprogram the search to find 6.1, but then after that is completed you wont be able to dial in 10.1 after turning antenna back because the TV did not permanently store that channel prior to the new search.  My 34\" Sony 960XBR can do this no problem!", "Date": "April 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good, but not great", "Author": "Greg A. Black", "ReviewID": "RVJX87IR4MI8Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Samsung's 19\" LN-T1953H HDTV has a lot of very nice features and is a good product, but a few things keep it from being great.The claimed viewing angle is 160\u00b0, but, in reality, the small screen has to be viewed almost dead on.  While overall color and saturation are good, blacks are weak.Two annoyances with the LCD panel used in this unit are what keep it from being great: 1) The native aspect ratio of the 1440 x 900 panel is closer to 15:9 than 16:9, so HD broadcasts get cut off on the sides in \"wide mode.\"  In \"16:9 mode\" HD broadcasts don't quite fill the screen top and bottom revealing the second flaw; 2) backlight \"leaks\" (as some others have mentioned) cast a bit of a halo effect around the edge of the panel and become noticeable when the screen should be dark, or when viewing HD broadcasts in 16:9.  (A 19\" Philips unit using the same 1440 x 900 display panel garners the same complaint from some reviewers.)Otherwise, this is a feature-rich set that looks great and performs very well.  The set's audio characteristics may be adjusted via a 5-band graphic equalizer so that it doesn't sound tinny or hollow.  The simulated surround sound adds a nice spatial effect without sounding unnatural.  The sound and picture pre-sets work well, and may also be customized.  The ATSC/QAM/NTSC tuners work well and the built-in digital noise reduction makes analog broadcasts look better.  While it can take several minutes for channels to be scanned into memory, Samsung includes a very nice feature that automatically erases scrambled (cable) channels during the scan.  Samsung also allows the viewer to \"see\" all of the channels stored in memory, though navigating through them can be a bit tedious.  The unit's base comes pre-attached and allows for some tilting of the panel which may be beneficial when the unit is mounted below eye level.  PIP works only with multiple inputs connected, i.e. when also used as a computer monitor.Overall, a good 19\" HDTV suitable for dual-purpose use as a computer monitor in a bedroom, den or kitchen.", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good TV, but some quirks", "Author": "C. Wirth", "ReviewID": "RH1NP36C8NPV2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought an LNT1953H about a month ago, and wanted to point out some things that are missed in other reviews or in the specifications:1. While the LCD panel itself is 1440x900 resolution, when you use the TV as a PC monitor, the highest resolution you can use is 1320x768. The unused pixels on the top and bottom are black, and for some reason the Samsung puts grey bars on either side of the image. I hope this is something they can fix with a firmware update.2. Because of the TV's native resolution, it's actually got a 16:10 aspect ratio, not the HDTV standard 16:9. Watching standard HD content leaves pixels at the top and bottom of the screen unused. You can scale up the image, but there isn't a setting that allows you to both fill the screen and keep the proper aspect ratio. Standard def programming is scaled to fit to the top and bottom of the screen, with the expected black bars on either side.3. It takes a surprising amount of time for the TV to power on, at least as long as my old Sony 13\" Trinitron TV took (about 10-15 seconds). I don't see why this is, as LCDs don't need to warm up like CRTs do -- my LCD computer monitor powers on in 3 seconds, why can't the Samsung?4. There's an included wall-mount bracket with the TV, but it's not a flush-mount VESA bracket (though the TV does have VESA mounting points). Instead, you fold the TV's base back so it's parallel with the back of the TV, then hook it onto the wall bracket. Mounted this way, the TV sticks out from the wall a pronounced amount.In general, for the $450 or so this unit regularly sells for, it's a good deal for casual watching. I wouldn't buy this unit with the intention of having it also serve as a primary PC monitor, however.", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "RN6ORJJGQV04B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this set for about 2 months now and I've been very happy with it.  It gives a good, sharp picture from digital cable and off-air HDTV broadcasts.  I like the multiple screen formats available - standard 4:3, 16:9, and widescreen.  You can default non-HD channels to stretch to fill the screen, and in most cases it doesn't look at all distorted.However, I do have one gripe, and it could have affected my decision to buy this particular set had I known about it beforehand.  The picture-in-picture feature only works if one of the pictures comes from the PC input. And the other picture must be an analog signal.  This means if you don't use the set as an external monitor for your computer, then you have no PIP.  If you do use it as a monitor, your other picture must be analog cable or from an antenna - nothing digital.It's a shame that a set with so many input possibilities (cable, antenna, component, HDMI, PC, s-video) can't have a true PIP that can swap between any two of them.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Just Fine", "Author": "Mark A.

There are a lot of simple features that require lots of paging through menus rather than pushing a button on the remote.  If you want to listen to the sound from the Picture-in-Picture, you must walk through several menu screens to change it.Finally, the picture in picture only displays the antenna input when the main screen is in a different mode (PC / component in).

I don't subscribe to cable and I don't watch broadcast television and so I will never be using the tuner that is built-in for this model. Additionally, I route the audio from the DVD player into my home stereo which has a good Harman Kardon amplifier and Cambridge Soundworks powered subwoofer and satellite speakers. I am more of an audiophile than video enthusiast. Therefore, I don't know if the built-in speakers in this TV are any good since I'm not using them and do not plan to do so.I bought this model because it's small enough (flat-panel 19\") to fit into my tight living quarters where most of the space is taken up by musical instruments and audio gear, and because it is a widescreen model (I watch mostly movies), and because it is a Samsung which is a brand that has a good reputation for LCD TVs (I'm led to believe). The picture looks good on all the DVDs I've looked at, and there are plenty of parameters in the menu options to adjust picture and sound quality to suit your viewing preferences. Picture size is easily changed with a single button on the remote for switching between discs or content with different viewing formats. I like that you can choose either widescreen or 16/9 settings since DVDs are sometimes formatted in one or the other mode and it's nice to get the fullest possible screen image with no cropping of the side borders. In short, I've got no complaints (so far), and I give it 4 out of 5 stars (I assume there are better models out there, but I'm on a limited budget so I don't feel compelled to seek them out).One word of warning: When I took the TV out of the box and set it up, the first thing I did was adjust all the picture settings to suit my preferences. But then in the middle of watching something the settings would automatically revert to factory default settings, which are a garishly bright, color-saturated, high-contrast image quality that is hideous to look at. Searching the owner's manual for a solution to the problem was fruitless, so I went to the Samsung customer support website to search for answers. There, I quickly found (with great relief, since I was ready to return the TV to the store where I bought it) that the unit was in \"shop mode\" which is the setting used for display in brightly lit retail store environments. It was a simple matter to take the set out of shop mode and return it to normal \"dynamic mode\" for home use:If the unit is accidentally set to Shop mode and you want to return to Dynamic (Home) mode, press the Volume button and then hold down the MENU button for five seconds on the side panel of the TV.I don't know why they failed to include that important info in the manual, but there you are.Let's hope this TV keeps working as well as it has been so far (of course, I paid extra for the extended service plan in case it craps out in the next four years).", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "positive", "Author": "Chief", "ReviewID": "R2S9Q3GORN6SVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No issues here....the TV arrived from AMAZON in 4 days with free shipping and no TAX.

I have had it replaced twice under warranty for the white haze around the peremiter of the picture that you may have read about. All three of these have the same problem. I was told by Samsung that \"Our own Engineers have confirmed unit is within manufacturing specifications and is not defective.\" Kind of like when you buy a new house and you can see the seams in the drywall, and the builder tells you, \"we won't fix it, it's built to code\".Upon further research you will find this haze, for which the technical term is \"mura\" and also called \"clouding\" is a systemic problem with both Samsung and Sony. If you google \"Samsung mura\" you will find 145000 pages refering to the problem. If you google \"Sony Mura\" you get 304000 pages. And yet Samsung told me over the phone that they were unaware of any such problems... unbelievable.As it turns out Sony and Samsung co-own the factory that builds the LCD panels, thusly they have the same problem.If you're not teribly picky about this kind of thing then it may not bother you, if you think that you deserve a quality item because you spent $500 on a 19\" LCD, then I'd suggest you look elsewhere.

There are more than enough inputs/outputs to do everything that I would want to do with this TV.While it does have a decent enough picture, the light bleed at the top of the screen is extremely annoying. Unfortunately, this wasn't visible in the store or I would have walked right by this set.It also has less than great sound. I didn't expect much in the way of audio from a set like this, but it sounds something like a cheap transistor radio from the '50s.Given that I use this set in my bedroom to mostly watch the news or an occasional late-night program, I can certainly live with its shortcomings.I'm in the market for a much larger HDTV for my main HT setup and I'm having a hard time accepting that Samsung is supposed to be one of the \"premium\" brands. I'll be thinking (and looking) long and hard before buying another Samsung TV.That said, I've already ruled out a Samsung LCD monitor for my PC after reading reviews that several models under consideration suffer from the same lightbleed issues as this TV.Edited: Well, it's been a few weeks now so I thought I'd add a few comments.1- I've now hooked the set up to an HD set top box so that I can view whatever my cable provider (Time Warner in NYC) transmits in HD. I've used a 1.3 compatible HDMI cable instead of regular coaxial so my signal should be the best possible.2- Perhaps I'm missing something (and I don't claim to be an expert), but why am I getting resolution no higher than 480p? Is it based on what is being broadcast? I thought this set was capable of 720p and 1080i but that doesn't seem to be the case.3- I've been able to tweak the sound a bit by going into the menu and adjusting the equalizer. It's not a major improvement, but it no longer sounds quite as tinny.All in all, I have my doubts about buying another Samsung product if this is any example of their quality.", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R1WBV5W7KZFI00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had previously purchased a 32 inch Samsung LCD and really like the looks, picture and overall quality.

Add to that, there are no backlights to the on-tv buttons, so it's difficult to find them in the dark when you can't also locate the remote.I don't watch long in the dark, so this wasn't enough of a problem to send the thing back.", "Date": "May 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "I'm not happy.....", "Author": "AK", "ReviewID": "RE3A8KSNVQ8G2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After reading all of the reviews, I figured that this Samsung LCD would be a great TV.

Westervelt (Valley Forge PA) - See all my reviewsI purchased this TV last summer and it was worked very well as both a HDTV and a Computer Monitor. The tuner is excellent, the video and audio has been excellent, and the refresh rate and resolution also been very good for use with a computer as a monitor.The only thing that drives my a wall with this otherwise excellent TV is the really poor way that Samsung included the function to switch the audio source between the main screen and the PIP screen. Because I use this as a Computer monitor at least 75% of the time, I use the Picture in Picture capability to allow me to watch TV while I work on the computer.It is possible to set the system to use the audio for the subscreen but it requires going into the configurations, finding the sound settings, then scroll to the speaker source and scroll to change it to the subwindow as the audio source. So yea, you can change it and it does work.The problem is that if you change the source back to the TV mode you lose the PIP settings for the computer mode and when you come back you need to reconfigure it again. In addition, if you close the PIP scren, you need to go through the menu and set it again.It drives me up a wall that one of the butons on the remote do not toggle the audio option OR that the TV does not save the configuration so that it knows when you are in the computer mode to use the PIP audio source. This one really annoying aspect drives me nuts every day I use it and it drove me to finally post about it.It is a shame as otherwise this was the perfect HDTV/Monitor setup for my needs but a silly audio problem makes me climb the wall 90% of the time.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "You can't ask for more....", "Author": "S.

If you have a game system that's not HD compatible like the PS3, u will get the same awful picture. There were also blue lights on the top edge of the TV. As soon as we saw that, we knew that TV was defective. We took it back to Best Buy & exchanged it hoping this next one would look better. Well, this one didn't have the blue lights on top, but it had white clouding/lights all around the TV's edges...very distracting. We will be returning this TV back to Best Buy again & getting a TV that works well with standard definition game systems such as the V-Smile, Leapster, etc. & regular cable programming.So, bottom line...to get the same wonderful picture u see at a store, u need to have EVERYTHING HD compatible. If u have digital cable & no HD channels or programming, this will NOT work for you & will be a waste of time & $...not to mention all the stress & frustration u will get.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent reception using the 29\" Samsung", "Author": "Kathleen Valentine", "ReviewID": "R1S6VUHXYGC00X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With using only a roof top antenna, I get excellent reception of HDTV.
