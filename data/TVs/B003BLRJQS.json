They had a lot of TVs on hand and I reviewed many of them on my Iphone while at the store.  It turns out that I got a really good deal on this TV for just over $500.00.  I brought it home and \"literally\" unplugged my 32\" set and plugged in this new 42\" set. (The 32\" set is going into another room so I got to get a new set for my birthday).  Anyway, I've only had it a couple hours, but so far it hooked up really easily and I put my Iphone in the dock and played a Southpark episode and it was crystal clear.  I then tried some music and the TV remote allows you to navigate around you Iphone, or Ipod. Right now I have HD/Cable hooked up to it and am watching the Jets and Steelers game in HD and it's amazing.  Go for this set!  Good luck and enjoy it!", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Exceeding expectations", "Author": "William P. Gibbs", "ReviewID": "R2BWWEYL1109LT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has so far, been wonderful.  Picture is good, and I have liked the teledock feature a lot.  It allows me to recharge my iphone, view photos, watch videos and listen to my music without having to have an apple TV or other internet connection. It is great to see iphone my pictures on the TV so the whole family can enjoy them.  Integrates well with my Dishnetwork HD receiver, except I found that the receiver only worked with HDMI inputs 2 or 3, not with 1.  Once I figured that out I have not had any problems.The picture is remarkably clear on HD channels,with bright colors and deep blacks.The speakers are acceptable, but like most of these TVs, nothing special.  This doesn't really matter, however, as I have a home theater setup I also bought after I got the TV, and together they provide an excellent package.All in all a great tv.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "42\" JVC Full 1080p LCD HDTV w/ Teledock for Ipod", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411ZK9KF%2BML._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003BLRJQS"}}
