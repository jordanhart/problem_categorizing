I was hoping to upgrade to the HDMI connector and a digital tuner. The problem with this tv is viewing angle, HORRIBLE! Unless you are sitting directly in front of this tv don't even bother. Doesn't even come close to the tv I had prior to this one, and that tv was nothing special. This one is even worse!", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "RCA AC/DC 15 inch Portable Television", "Author": "Don't want to set a pen name", "ReviewID": "RJB1NFCU0LYVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an issue with the first TV, but it was merely a fluke and I am certain that it was delivery guy being rough with the package.I really like this TV immensely and would recommend to anyone. It's lightweight, nice looking, easily portable, has a high quality picture, and the TV's several options can't be beat. It does everything but the dishes. I like that I can use in my car, at home or away from home. It goes anywhere you don't have a TV; like vacation, or visiting someone who does not own a TV.It picks up at least 18 channels with $3.00 rabbit ears, (all local networks and pbs channels come in perfectly, with a few additional channels, I've never heard of, and love) also connects to cable when you have access. It plays DVD's and the picture is great. You have to load the discs backwards, but the ease of use is wonderful and the remote works well with many options.This is a no-brainer purchase. I just couldn't be happier with the picture, the quality of product, and the price. It's actually gone down 30.00 since I purchased; so I am going to purchase another one even though I don't need it!The only thing I would improve on, would be the tone a teeny bit (but certainly not bad at all) and volume level--wish it could be a bit louder when in a noisy area. I can always add speakers or use headphones, so problem solved! The volume and tone is definitely not horrible as is; and really just depends if you're in a noisy area. I even used this at the Airport during a layover. Priceless!I look forward to getting my second one to give as a gift, or keep for myself. If this item does stop working at some point, I will definitely purchase the same exact one, unless it's been upgraded by then.Side note: I do wish RCA sold a carrying case for ease in travel, but I just use a padded large beach bag which fits everything. It comes with a protective piece of plastic on the screen, and I have left it on to protect the screen. You can see the picture just as clearly. This way the screen does not get scratched with all the traveling and taking it in and out of the bag.If others are not happy with this, I am shocked. This is not meant to be a high quality home theater TV, but it's great for camping, driving long distance, for the kitchen or small dorm room/kids room. It's one of the best buys I've made and I make a lot of purchases.
