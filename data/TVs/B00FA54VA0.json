{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Aesthetically pleasing set, but lacking in one key area - Picture quality!", "Author": "Jonathan 2.4", "ReviewID": "RGGYO7HWYMTB8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I guess I'll be the first person to review this on the internet: For reference, I'm coming from a Mitsubishi 60\" WD-60638 DLP TV and have also used an LG 60\" Plasma (which looked fantastic, and only went back due to the glare during the day caused by a very well lit living room).PROS:- Nice connection options. Even has a headphone output which would be nice for people who don't have an A/V receiver and don't wish to disturb others.- No smart features etc. This is nice because it keeps the price lower for those of us who don't need it (Hooked to my HTPC).- Very large.- Actually seems thinner than it appeared in the photo, but not as thin as an edge-lit. I'll see if I can upload some pictures later.- Aesthetically pleasing.CONS:- Picture quality. (all stars lost here)- Menu options are limited in terms of adjustments. Contrast, brightness, color, sharpness, and color temp are pretty much it. Limits how much I can actually \"fix\" the picture quality.PICTURE QUALITY - I'll start this off by saying that this is the part I really had high hopes for. I really wanted to like this TV before I even got it unboxed. Right now I have it hooked up in my living room to my HTPC, and out of the box the colors on this thing are absolutely terrible! This was to be expected though, but I was a bit shocked by how bad it really was. I made that conclusion when I had only looked at pictures, but they are all oversaturated with a lot of banding in them. I'm not sure how to describe it other than that, but it looks like my LG Plasma did when I initially set it up with a calibration profile I got off the net which was later corrected using my own settings. I'm hoping I can adjust it to look decent, but after some time in doing so, I still don't like what I see. With HD videos (The Pioneer Kuro Summer 2008 Blu-ray for example) this is not as apparent, and the picture seems ok. However, it has a very digital look to it, if that makes sense. You can also tell that, while \"vibrant\" looking, the colors are not actually accurate at all.I have managed to improve the image, but it isn't at a level that I'm satisfied with yet. The picture on my DLP looks much better and more natural than this with very little in the way of adjustment. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the difference between LCD and rear projection DLP technology, and if this is something I would have to live with? If anyone could comment on that I would appreciate it. I also wonder if the extra 5\" is just larger to the point that it has caused some loss of clarity given the screen size and the limited resolution of 1920x1080?I've also run this on some HD content through Time Warner, and there is a very digital look to ALL of the video I see regardless of the network. This could be due to Time Warner compressing the signal, or could more likely be the result of the TV.I'm going to look for something I can use to calibrate the display using something other than \"what I think my photos should look like\" along with the Windows 7 screen calibration tool.Overall, at this moment I am leaning heavily towards this going back in favor of another TV that will be on sale for Black Friday, or just getting a nice projector and building my own screen (especially if this is just something inherent with large format LCD displays). I will at least hold onto this long enough to get another LCD to compare to so that I can adjust my score accordingly if I deem it to be the fault of LCD technology rather than this particular display.I'll update this with my impressions once I think I've got it about as calibrated as it will get.Picture Quality UPDATE 11/24/2013 - The picture seems to have either gotten better, or perhaps I have just adjusted to it. I mean this to address the color issue. The digital effect I am seeing leads me to believe that it may be something inherent to the size of this display and the given resolution, but I cannot be sure.An additional negative I have noticed is that the frame interpolation (Like Samsung's SmoothMotion) cannot be turned off. Additionally, it appears to hiccup at times which is incredibly annoying.I still maintain that I will return the set, because there are some very subtle defects in the image that would be too annoying to live with. If this is just a fluke, then I would say for the money, and the right seating distance, that this set might not be that bad. I still can only give it 3 out of 5 stars though.AUDIO: Complete trash! I didn't expect much, but I didn't think it would be this bad either. I suppose I've been spoiled by the better speakers that a rear projection TV can offer. I quickly solved this by hooking it up to my A/V receiver to output through my discrete speakers.PACKAGING - The packaging had to make up about 20lbs of the total weight when I picked this thing up. It was very substantial and well done.BUILD - Overall, the build quality appears to be what you would expect from any manufacturer. I can't speak for the longevity since I just got it setup today. The stand was very sturdy as well, so there were no real worries about it getting tipped over (If I were keeping it, I would wall mount it).The only thing I am starting to notice as I have progressed through this review is that it seems that the display is uneven in its tone. It almost appears as if there is a line going straight down the display about 8 inches to the right of center screen. To the left of this apparent line, the screen seems slightly yellowed. If I sit directly center of the screen this is not so obvious, but it does not move once it shows up as I vary the degree of my angle. This leads me to believe it is a defect of some sort. This is also only really apparent on majority white screens. During normal viewing it is not obvious, but since I know it is there, it will now burn holes in my eyes each time I see it.OTHER NOTES: The two stars I took off were for the picture quality. This is the one area I needed this TV to excel, and I feel that it is merely, ok. I would have given the TV a 2.5 out of 5 stars if I could, and that is mainly because I'm hoping that it could be due to the potential defect that it seems might exist. I read somewhere that Seiki gets their panels from Samsung (can someone confirm). If so, then maybe this was a Samsung reject panel?This set didn't automatically work with HD channels. I ended up needing to call a phone number which gave me an email address to send my model number to. Within seconds I was given an unlock code to get me back on my way. This isn't a con, but just a slight inconvenience.Also, this thing came with a sticker that says it is an estimated $40 a year to run, which seems really high for an LED-LCD display. I wonder why this is? A search on Amazon of displays that are similar in size indicates that this is abnormally high.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good picture after Calibration", "Author": "Lawson-McKeever", "ReviewID": "R2QA66GYPRS36W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked up this TV a couple of days ago and here are my initial impressions.  For reference I am viewing from 8 ft away in a 10\u2019 by 12\u2019 room.Pros:-Good connection options, 3 HDMI, component, coax, usb, and 3.5 mm audio out-Very thin for TV\u2019s in price range-Giant Screen-Picture after calibrationCons:-initial picture quality-limited menu options-minor manufacturing issue in stand-No web connectivity/AppsPackaging was very good with this TV, the box was giant and TV was very secure inside with Styrofoam basically surrounding the Entire TV.  Setup was easy, simply screw in six screws to connect stand to main unit.  Or it would have been easy however there is a small metal plate on the bottom of the stand that was glued on incorrectly.  (It was an easy fix I just grabbed a flathead screwdriver and popped the metal plate off and realigned it correctly, in all it only took about an extra minute or so.)  The rest of the TV seemed to be constructed well and there was no noticeable give when I was setting the TV up.Picture quality out of the box was horrendous, I hooked up my chromecast and played The Avengers.  The artifacting was so bad that at first I thought there was a problem with my internet connection.  I switched to my blu-ray player and had the same issues.  That being said after calibrating the TV for a couple of hours the picture quality looks amazing.  Colors are great, maybe slightly saturated but overall the image is very good and the artifacting issues were completely gone.  Blacks are good but definitely not at plasma levels.  While watching Star Trek Into Darkness I could tell between screen and bezel in dark scenes.  However, blacks are good enough that I was not bothered by it.  The refresh rate is also very good and I was able to clearly follow fight the invasion scenes in The Avengers.  I have since watched the Hobbit, Man of Steel, and Star Trek Into Darkness and they all looked very good.  Basically, this TV can deliver a very good picture if you are able to fine tune it, however, it may not be suited for someone who feels uncomfortable with changing the picture settings.Audio quality is terrible, I have a very small living room and these speakers are some of the weakest I have ever heard.  External speakers are a must, which at this price point is not overly surprising.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "NO NO NO NO NO", "Author": "xiaohua", "ReviewID": "R2YOSEYZDZFB03", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DONT BUY IT!!!!no matter what, do not buy this TV.PRO- it was on sale for cheap.- looks nice physicallyCONS- picture out of the box is really really bad, very blue,- cannot calibrate the color to the correct tone, people look sunburned, i tried for hours calibrating in the service menu (menu button, 0000)- stuttering effect, somethings wrong with the image processor trying to convert the 60hz to 240 / 120 hz- when i tested with a white page, i see the white is not uniform, theres a vertical blue tint in the center, corners are also dimmer- when i open a webpage and i start scrolling, i notice the whole tv's color changes depending on other image color coming onto the screen. this is messed up!! its like the new color, say a red sweater image, will start making the whites look slightly redthe most important part of a TV... the picture quality and smoothness, it gets it wrong, not even close", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very high picture quality!

I tried calling Seiki to correct the problem, they gave me the name of a website where I could buy a cheap stand as opposed to trying to fix the problem. Suggested I contact Tigerdirect where I ordered the TV online as well but they seemed disinterested in solving something that was very clearly a manufacturing defect. I asked to speak to a manager and was told none was available. I left my number with them so a manager could call me and was told I was soon receiving a call. That was yesterday, still no call. When something is broken out of the box and you suggest I go buy a replacement myself that is horrible customer service and as a new brand I thought people should know what type of customer service they are providing.
