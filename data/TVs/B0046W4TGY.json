Universal Remotes will not work.  No place locally or on the internet can I find a replacement aRemote or the remote codes that will work for this set.  Without a remote,you can't switch to AV to watch a DVD since there is no \"enter\" button on thecontrols on the side of the TV.  Have tried for several days to find a remote that works and have had no luck.  If you google Telesonic, you willfind a website in spanish I believe but nothing on how to get a remote.  The Manual is generic and only says \"32inch LCD\" and has little info onthe set.  The remote doesn't even have a brand name on it or model number.  It looks like someone buys these and then names it what ever they wantand sell it for whatever price they want.  The back of the set says \"32\" LCD, made in China\".  Go to the big box stores and get a name brand setfor half the price.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$386.96", "Features": "32-inch Telesonic LT-3210RU 720p Widescreen LCD HDTV General Features:\nColor: glossy black front panel Screen size: 32-inch Tuner: NTSC ATSC Resolution: 1366 x 768\nPixel Pitch: 0.51075 x 0.51075 Maximum Colors: 16.7M Horizontal Frequency: 44 KHz ~ 53 KHz\nVertical Frequency: 50 Hz ~ 66 Hz Brightness: 450 cd/m2 Contrast: 4000:1 Response Time: 5 ms\n3D digital comb filter", "Name": "32\" Telesonic LT-3210RU 720p Widescreen LCD HDTV - 16:9 4000:1 5ms 2 HDMI ATSC/NTSC Tuners (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Xe44Dm7TL.jpg", "ProductID": "B0046W4TGY"}}
