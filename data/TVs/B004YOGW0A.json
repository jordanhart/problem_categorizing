{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrible TV", "Author": "Alaska", "ReviewID": "R3CRFTVALDPXKZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this tv for our camper thinking it was a great buy. The tv controls and remote are NOT USER FRIENDLY they must be suited for Japan controls. the tv lasted 27 days then decided it was not going to eject our dvd and would not even recognize that there was a movie in it at all. Since it was within the 30 days LUCKILY Amazon would let us return it at our expense then refunded the shipping charges and gave me a credit for the dvd that was still in the tv. We decided to try our luck with the Supersonic TV that Amazon carries and hopefully will have better luck with it. I do not recommend this Naxa tv at all and have not had a chance to try the Supersonic as of yet. Amazon handeled this situation and returned every penny  including our shipping charges to originally get the tv here which is why I keep coming back.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty good little TV", "Author": "KwQd", "ReviewID": "R29UDKI59GNLFI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for a couple of months, now, and am quite pleased with it. I also have Sony, Panasonic and Philips (2) flat screen TVs, and this one is slightly worse than those with respect to image and sound quality, but still quite acceptable. I purchased this TV because of the ability to run it on 12 volts in the case of an emergency. That feature trumps the better sound and picture quality of my other TVs since they will be paperweights and door stops when the power goes out. I did not like the default color quality but was able to adjust it, using the pre-configured, color balance choices to find a setting I like. So far no problems with the DVD player or TV, knock on wood. I have a friend who is a long haul truck driver and he has had his TV in his truck for quite a while with no issues. He told me that this a popular TV with truck drivers, so it must be a basically sound TV. The remote is not well designed in my opinion, but will probably suffice, once I am used to it. The buttons, including volume and channel select, are very small. Some of the buttons are multifunction which is confusing and awkward. That being said, this design is not so problematic that I am looking for a different remote for this TV. I was somewhat surprised to discover that the TV has to be in DVD mode, selected using the remote, before it will pull in a DVD. My TV does not remember where to restart playing a DVD if the set is powered down. The manual that comes with the TV is not well written, but the information needed appears to be in it. For instance, it took a while for me to figure out that there was a separate DVD mode, which was not automatically started when a DVD was inserted as with my other TVs.All in all, I am pleased with this TV and recommend it, if you need to run off of 12 volts. I think my 19\" Panasonic LCD/LED TV has both better sound, image quality, heuristics and general quality than this TV and would recommend that TV otherwise. You can check out my reviews on the other 19\" TVs that I own.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "DVD player", "Author": "Sherry Marie", "ReviewID": "RTUKV4YGBAYE1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DVD player quite working after watching a few DVD, sent it back in while under warranty (still had to pay for UPS packaging and postage/insurance $90)  Got it back but had to call after a month and ask where it was.  I am a snowbird and only use it 3 months of the year.  Put a DVD in and it would not work again after only using in a couple times last April, same thing, tray error.  Customer service says too bad they only cover it for a year, so they don't guarantee their repair work.  So not only is their merchandise junk but their customer service and warrantee work is nonexistent, don't waste your money on this TV and postage packaging insurance sending it back and forth.l", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "didn't hold up", "Author": "Robin Alexis", "ReviewID": "R2LKBE0GARNKC9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My husband and I bought this to just watch dvds.
