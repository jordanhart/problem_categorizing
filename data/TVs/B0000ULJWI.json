{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just bought.", "Author": "Altruism Is Dead \"Random reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R2PVVBZV2M32DM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought this tv acouple days ago. I had been wanting a plasma screen television for quite some time, and when I seen the price of this for alittle bit under $2,000 in a local advertisement I had to take a look at it.When I went there I was quite impressed with it, visually it looked great, the design of the case and the picture quality itself. I asked the sales person alot of question but he didn't really know too much about it so it made me question the integrity of SVA, a brand which I had never heard of at the time.I went online to try and find some reviews and information about it, but could only find these same reviews below on abunch of other websites, which didn't really help at all since you have 2 people saying they like it, and 1 person that posted twice about how it sucks and not explaining a reason why. After abit more research I read that the picture tube is made from a Samsung picture tube. I heard of this before where other companies like Dell import pieces of plasma screen tvs and construct them in one of their factories to keep the price down.After visiting the store again, this time with my brother to decide on final purchase, me and him went over all of their plasma tvs and gave them our own bare eye inspection. Both of us thought that the SVA had a great picture quality compared to all of the other plasma screen tvs they had on display, and in alot of cases it looked even better than alot of the tvs on display.When I bought it, the only thing that was bad was the stand was broken on it (which we recieved another stand) and for being a plasma screen tv and how thin it is, it is very heavy. The other thing is that it has no controls on the tv itself, there is no volume, channel, video select or even a television power on! (Although there is a main power turn on/off) So if your remote control breaks (and you don't have a universal remote programmed for it) it sounds like you'll have to order a new remote.I read from a different review that someone was having problems with the remote control and that it had a \"mind of its own\". I haven't came across this problem at all, either that person had a faulty remote control, or was talking nonsense.But still, like I mentioned before, I have recently bought this plasma tv, I haven't had any problems with it yet, and I had been looking up information about preventing burn-ins since I hear it plagues plasma tv's and I play alot of video games and intend to use it as a pc monitor as well.Also another nice addition was that included ALL the hook ups you need. I am not sure about the exact amount of cords, but it include acouple of the same ones like 2 a/v cords, 2 normal left/right audio cords, 1 component, 1 s-video, 1 pc cord, 1 pc to component (which is really cool), 1 analog(?) cable, and 1 audio (you know like a head phone jack) to left/right audio cord.  I thought that this was very cool since alot of tvs I had bought and other people bought didn't include, or only included maybe 1 or 2 cords.I gave this a rating of 4 because like I said, I had just recently purchased this tv and still am testing it out. I wrote this review to help people get alittle bit more knowledge about this tv since I couldn't find much help about it online either. My biggest suggestion for anyone interested in this tv is to go to a store and take a look at it and compare it to other plasma tv's, make sure to check for burn ins and everything. When I was checking it out at the store they did not have the audio set up, only the picture cables were hooked up, when I got it home and tested out the audio, I was quite surprised at the quality of it since I heard alot of plasma screens with speakers didn't give good quality. But still I run all my audio through my reciever for surround sound, which the majority of people that purchase plasma tv's do as well, so you wont be worrying much about the audio on this... which I believe by looking at it, it has 4 sets of speakers, I could be wrong... but it did give off some nice sound for when I was testing it out.", "Date": "July 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Best priced EDTV plasma with everything you need.", "Author": "Linda Kirk", "ReviewID": "R1XVJAN6GAXNP3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I'm not new to plasma's. I bought my first HDTV plasma more than a year ago! It is the Pioneer 433cmx with approx 1072x760 pixels. This is true HD, but although the Pioneer works great, it cost me $4,200 total. So now I've learned that the difference between the EDTV units and the HDTV units is the pixels. When you watch a DVD on a EDTV plasma like the SVA unit, it will look slightly better than a HDTV plasma because the pixels on the EDTV unit closely match the DVD and when you play HDTV signals on a HDTV plasma, the HDTV will show a slightly better picture than the EDTV. So is the HDTV worth $2000 more??  I used my eyeball test and compared the SVA Plasma to the other EDTV plasmas in a local store and decided on the SVA. Amazon has a great price and the unit comes with everything, cast iron desk stand, great speakers with base and treble controls, a tuner for cable or RF signals, 2 composite video inputs, 1 component and 1 15pin computer monitor input. I don't use the PIP feature but its there. I use this in the bedroom and its great! comes with a 1 year warranty. Thanks Amazon! I gave this a 4 only because of its weight. With the stand it weighs 135lbs and I needed help lifting it on to its viewing table.", "Date": "May 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "On balance, quite a great way to spend 2k", "Author": "Tom Schwab", "ReviewID": "R1NWHYEVCBTKFI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned my SVA for about three months now. It is on for at least 8 to 12 hours a day. We have not had a single issue at all so far. I run a replay dvr unit into this plasma and it looks great. DVD's look great at 720. I have friends who have much more expensive units that they bought last year, including Sony and Dell. They are all very impressed with the picture quality. The replay has a slide show on 'pause' and it looks great on the screen. The static picture (10 second slideshow) gets excellent reviews with no flicker or dead pixels. It really looks great. Even in fast action scenes in adventure movies do not cause image issues on the screen. I almost bought a Sony or a Fujitsu since I didn't really want to think or do research about the quality of the unit. One of the costco home workers said that over a 100 had left the warehouse and only one was returned (and it was not returned for a failure). I cannot speak to other issues about customer service since I have not had to deal with them. I have been saving a lot of money by buying dvd's and watching movies at home with this plasma and the surround sound. It is really awesome and I wish I had bought this thing last year when I first saw it. The only issue I have is the component video input via the 15 pin dsub. One of the two silver retaining screws (just like any pc card has) fell out. Therefore the vga connection is not super tight but it still works. As another reviewer mentioned, this unit is heavy and I have it about 5 feet in the air on a hearth. So, only when I have someone help me lift it down will I replace it. Other than that, it is pretty cool. Buy this unit and save the money you would spend for a name brand!UPDATEOver one year later and still going strong.  I don't detect any burn in or any dead pixels either.", "Date": "August 10, 2004"}, {"Title": "Best Buy", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1P8KXLPB6JMHC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the SVA Plasma 2 month ago from buy.com and so far I have not complain at all about this unit. First of all, the picture quality is sharp and nice unlike some of those reviews saying it has bad picture quality. You can easily spend $1000 more for the same picture quality for big brand names. Second, it comes with everything, you don't need to spend extra money buying necessary part. I use it a lot as my PC monitor with the PC comes with wireless keyboard and mouse. The Picutre on PC is excellent and exceeding my expectations. 42 inch monitor for my PC, it is cool. The unit also has nice design. You can't go wrong with the product.", "Date": "May 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great deal so far", "Author": "M.

The picture is great the computer looks great the price was great at 1999. Lots of inputs and comes with the stand and all the cords for every input.

I am used to a 32\" sony trinitron so I know what a good picture looks like. Willl keep you informed. Ps And if there is humming I cant hear it and I dont usually watch tv with out the sound on.

There is no reason to spend 3500 for a panasonic or 5g's for a sony because the quality of this screen is top notch and the low price makes it that much better.  I do agree with one of the other reviewers in that the screen is uncharacteristically heavy, something to take into consideration if you want to wall mount this unit.  Other than that there are only two drawbacks and the reason for the 4 not 5 star rating is that its EDTV and no DVI input.", "Date": "July 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Super Product ..Best Buy for the Money...SVA HD4208TVI-PDP", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R21N45YTQHO4GR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is for the new model SVA HD4208TVI-PDPSVA assmebles this product in China but uses Samsung Plasma screens among other manufactures for assembely of this product. For your money u cannot beat the value of this unit.DVD and TV looks far superiour to my 4 year top 36inch Toshiba CRT. As well this unit was among various other plamsa screens from all the makers in the store all playing the same dvd. Honestly at a distance of 6ft and over from screen you would have a hard time telling the difference between this and any other manufacture. Oh wait there is a difference The money U save can be spent on a better DVD player or audio equipment u might need as well as the Wife factor Take her out for dinner with the xtra money u save.

I have been in audio/tv sales for 15 years. So im quite up to date on all products and tends. Upon reading these reviews for those who have had issues. Sorry to hear that and if u feel spending 2k more money on a brand name makes u feel better then go ahead.I'll keep the xtra money I saved in the bank by buying this product SVA (basicly a rebadged Samsung). I own this Plasma as well and find it's performance is unmatched by any other product at this price point or more and Yes it does use a Samsung plasma screen. The unit is well built. Picture quality is fantastic with DvD and Tv is actually good for cable signals better then CRT DLP or LCOS. Unlike other projection units DLP LCOS and so on this unit has even brightness and colour not seen in rear projectors as well as it doesnt have a beamy picture like dlp and LCOSAs for the other reviewer saying he cant turn it on after shutting it off . It says in the manual DO NOT TURN ON WITHIN 2 MINUTES AFTER SHUTTING IT OF! Might be why u have a issue U need to read the manual This is why they have it. Sure the manual isnt the best but it covers the most important features. Anyway I think u all should give this unit some consideration. In a few years this comapny SVA will be just like Samsung.

This means two things: 1) questionable build quality and durability, and 2) subpar image quality.You may be attracted by the attractive price on this set, but believe me, there's a reason why it's so cheap.  Unlike state-of-the-art plasma planels from Pinoneer and Panasonic, the SVA exhibits poor contrast, no matter how you try to adjust the settings.  There's also significant pixelation when viewing fast-action scenes, such as sports.  The exterior also feels rather flimsy, which is not surprising given the low-cost market the company builds its \"reputation\" in.For two grand, you only get EDTV meaning the resolution tops out at 480.  A little more money will get you HDTV entries from Gateway.  Given 720p is pretty much a must given how fast the HDTV industry is evolving, I recommend against an EDTV no matter what.  So what if you have a 42\" screen?  Remember the concept of \"dot pitch\" from the computer monitor world?  A low resolution looks especially bad on a large screen.  An older-technology-based screen like this SVA-Samsung is really not worth the savings, because in the long run you suffer, as you find yourself having to upgrade to true HDTV, not the least because all your friends have HDTV!Recommendation:  stay away from this cheap set with poor screen quality and unknown reliability.  I always think that if you are going to spend a lot of money on a TV, you might as well go with a good one.
