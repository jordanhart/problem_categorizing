(unless you step up to a good quality plasma screen).  The only issue I've had is with one corner of the set that gets some weird colors once in awhile.  From what I was told, this occurs because of the sensitivity of the set to the magnetic north and that if I turned the set, the problem would likely go away.  Besides that, dvds look perfect, and playstation 2 games are great looking on this set.", "Date": "January 10, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great for playing old electronics on.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"mikeystoyz\"", "ReviewID": "R2FQ3QW3LYHAIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want to play old videogames or vhs, dvd, laserdisc or whatever this is the machine for you.  I do know it is old but it is very good at what it does.  It even has the ability to play high def stuff, or at least mine does.  It is heavy as heck so be ready to strain a little to get it to move.  This is the tv you want to use for older stuff as the newer tvs upscale and do other things to the media and it doesnt look as good.  Personal opinion but hey, what can I say.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Serves a niche very well", "Author": "Kelly Garner", "ReviewID": "RU6K9RNOCE8KC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let's admit it: not everyone is ready for HDTV yet. We thought we were, but after dragging home a 34\" widescreen HD set and running analog cable through it, we were disappointed with the picture. All we wanted was a good set to replace an LCD front projector that was too clunky and noisy to watch DVDs and LDs on anymore. This set gets used 99% of the time as an everyday beater and in the few days since we exchanged the HD set, it does very well -- not as many PIP or POP options as the one we took back, but good enough for someone who'd never had it before. The V-compression 16:9 mode is very effective for DVDs and provides an excellent picture with a 480i DVD player. Haven't watched a laser disc yet, but should be better that the lousy job of upconverting that the HD set was trying to do. Beware -- better have a nice, strong TV stand to put it on. It's a heavy sucker!", "Date": "May 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Cablebox too high for my room and harder to tune and picture unsharp", "Author": "Joel Luna-Menjivar", "ReviewID": "RA6WIOO3O7EBW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Listen I'm telling you that I don't recommend this TV because I have Cablevision and its hard to navigate through channels. I'm not really saying its unsharp but it is sharp (which I'm saying is that I like LCD Plasma HDTV better because it is the right sight for my eyes and I can't see without glasses). Even my Dad will say that this TV is garbage and he plans to get a new LCD Plasma HDTV. Sony knows better than this and it ain't stupid. This doesn't meet the standards as it should be.
