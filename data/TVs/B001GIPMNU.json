But if you're picky about what you watch and you have a lot of windows in your house, this HDTV LCD is definitely worth the extra bucks--especially since Amazon has free shipping and discount rates.I was surprised how small the box was that this came it. It doesn't have a ton of protection around it. There is a thin film layer of plastic that protects the front bezel, which easily comes off. I did not use the stand, but put it on a swivel mount. Setup of the TV was very easy and the image outstanding, with beautiful colors and details right out of the box. By the way, a nice touch is that the TV's serial number is on the outside of the batteries for the remote control--which I wish I'd realized before searching the entire back of the TV with a flashlight (it was also on the back, but partly obscured by the swivel mount I'd used).You see some folks who talk about \"poor\" off angle viewing and \"blooming.\" I honestly haven't noticed either one. This thing looks great from a range of angles, the picture phenomenal.The TV speakers are okay but not great. If you're going to watch a lot of movies--and trust me, with this screen you're going to want to--I'd recommend getting the Sony BDV-1000ES and an HDMI cable. That way you get theatre-quality sound to match the picture and the Bravia Link means the two will communicate well with each other, and respond to one remote control. Then, just pop in a blu-ray disk, kick back, and enjoy. This is one great TV.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Truly a window to the world.", "Author": "Gerald V.

Shopping and looking, then I saw it. It was love at first sight. And it is a sight to behold. Crystal clear, vibrant realistic colors, and a beautiful design. Sony has outdone itself with a new benchmark for the industry. You will not be disappointed with this beauty. This is TV as it has never been. Coupled with my FIOS HD service and a blu-ray player there's little reason to ever attend a movie theater. Although my Bose surround system is the perfect mate to this TV, the eight built-in speakers leave little to be desired.

The others include the Pioneer Kuro PRO-111FD plasma and Samsung LN46A950 which also has LED back lighting. All are expensive so it's best to see all in person before you decide. The Kuro has been the gold standard for flat panels for some time, and rightly so, but the LCD sets with LED back lighting are now very close.Some reviewers have niggled about off angel viewing and color blooming but that is picking the finest of nits. The off angle viewing is as good as all but a very few CCL backlit LCD or plasma sets so I'm not sure what that's all about. I have a pivoting wall mount so problem solved. As for the blooming, it is so minor as to not be visible unless you are right at the screen looking for it and is not noticeable in normal use.The XBR8 will work better in a room with normal light levels than the Kuro and also renders standard definition programs better than the Kuro. It also beats the lone 1st generation LED set at rendering SD.The LED back lighting generates less heat than an LCD set with cold cathode back lighting and much less heat than a plasma due to it's lower electrical current draw. Each individual LED cluster is controlled dynamically so that they are shut completely off during dark scenes producing the same absolute black levels as the best plasma sets. The LED back light elements have a service life of something like 20,000hrs so replacement is not necessary. They also will not fade over time like a plasma set does.Whether this set is worth the money is a matter each person has to decide for themselves. Those that can afford one are very unlikely to ever become disappointed with the image. If you do buy one you owe it to yourself to get a full calibration done by an ISF certified tech in order to get all the potential out of this set.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Big bang for the buck!", "Author": "D. Ramos \"PC Soprano\"", "ReviewID": "R3FRWJZ5LY9YL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although the list price for this HDTV would be out of my budget, I purchased this amazing flat screen from Amazon for a little over $2,300.  In my local electronics store, the Sony was my 2nd favorite (after the Kuro).  The Samsung LEDs were close behind.  What makes this unit ideal for me is the fact that is still has pretty decent built-in speakers.  I personally hate having a sound system hooked up to my TV.  I like to be able to turn on my TV and go.  I made the salesman at my local store demonstrate the built-in sound to make sure it would be sufficient for my needs.  (I was really planning on buying it there but they raised the price overnight and then I found Amazon's amazing price which saved me over $600!)  Since we were originally thinking we were going to have to buy both a new TV (to replace our dying projection HDTV) and a home theater sound system (since none of the new flat screens seemed to have speakers at all anymore), we were able to apply that budget to this superior TV instead, which arguably has one of the best pictures available.Now that it is installed at home, I am absolutely thrilled!  I am more than happy with the built-in sound.  I admit that those who are used to having booming surround sound audio would probably be disappointed, but the sound set at medium levels is very nice for day to day viewing.  If you turn it up for serious BluRay DVD viewing, it is pretty impressive as well.  The picture is truly stunning!I must give kudos to Amazon for their customer service as well.  The first unit we were shipped turned out to have a cracked interior screen.  The box was undamaged and everything seemed fine until we powered it up.  There were massive cracks going across the screen (actually a picture of cracks since the exterior was fine, just the interior screen of some kind was broken - it was obvious it had been dropped at some point.)  I called Amazon immediately and they took care of it quickly and courteously and now we have our beautiful new TV.  Yes, I would have rather had a perfect unit the first time out, but the money we saved over purchasing from our local superstore was more than worth it.", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "XBR8 - why not?", "Author": "D.

We had a 28 inch CRT for 20+ years...  We are still blown away with the colors.  We initially planned on a 40-42 inch, now that we have the 46 we are not disappointed, ..50?55?..hmmm  No more room actually on our new TV console.Sound quality leaves a bit to be desired.  The speakers are just to small to have any quality sound.  We have a stereo system that we may have to incorporate with the TV watching.The one feature I was initially disappointed with was the lack of USB port recognition with a flash drive. Sony claims not all USB devices will work and recommends the SONY Micro Vault Flash drive to be compatible. Well after doing some web searching I did find some helpful info on the Sony eSupport page.  After learning the USB device must be FAT32 formatted I now can upload photographs (.jpg files) from even the least expensive flash drive.  I just re-formatted a SanDisk 250MB flashdrive and then a \"micro center\" 2GB flash drive I got for free!. After re-formatting to FAT32 the SONY recognizes the drive and I can now view my collection of digital photos.  I must add that when viewing good quality .jpg's (2-3meg size) the SONY displays the pics as sharp as a tack!!..the shots look the best I've ever seen. The colors are so real looking you feel as though you could touch the object as in real life.  Now I can pursue getting my 1000+ 35mm slides from Germany and England while in the service (40 years ago!) converted to .jpg files.  What better way to show all the slides as compared to to old slide projector/screen method...so archaic!I did learn as well at the eSupport Site there is a software update available for the set.  I'll be contacting Sony soon to verify if our set needs the update as we just purchased the TV 2 weeks ago.Tip:  Get the Support Belt Kit, Part #X21866021, to secure it to your console.  You don't want this massive set to inadvertently topple over.  Would recommend this set...the Sony's all outperformed other LCD's we looked at as far as color quality.

After much research (and saving) I finally chose the Pioneer 50\" Plasma - just before they announced they were getting out of the TV business, so I started from square one and I don't think I could be any happierThe Sony's picture is brilliant, the sound decent for a TV set and I like the \"floating\" speakers on the side. I have a wall above the fireplace that is wider than it is tall and it fits (visually) well. It works flawlessly with my Onkyo 7.1 system and up-sampling DVD (haven't made the BluRay leap yet) player.For as many features as it has, it was easy to set up and to navigate the menus for selecting inputs, etc.Did I mention the picture? Out of the box, it was close but after tweaking it with the Sound and Vision DVD, it is nothing short of amazing. I find myself watching ESPN's Sportscenter - not listening, just watching!Even the side-viewing angle is much better than I expected - the only negative would be the screen reflection. LCD is supposed to be better than Plasma, but you can still light sources in line with the screen (floor lamp, ceiling fan light, etc). No big deal, just takes some adjusting.If ultimate picture quality is worth it to you, this set has to be on your short list.

I narrowed it down to the Sony XBR8 and the Samsung LED 8500.  I viewed both hdtv's many times side by side and finally came to the decision to go with the Sony XBR8.  This tv is even beter than the XBR10 from sony which just came out this year. The XBR8 is the only lcd that has the red, green and blue LED BACKLIGHT.  Not even the new xbr10 has this, it has the clear led's.  I think this helps with the brightness of colors and really dark blacks.  As far as the reason not to go with the Samsung 8500 LED was that the XBR8 had slightly darker blacks and also had a crisper picture to it.  I'm happy with my Sony and the price was not bad, $2300.00 is what i got it for and upon its original release the tv was going for $5000.00.

I had a 24 inch Sony CRT with which I was quite content.  My social circle wasn't so happy; they tell me it was a relic (2001). Succumbing to peer pressure, I was on the hunt for a nice TV. I started out looking at the lower end Bravia lines, particularly the Z5100. In the end, I narrowed the choice down to Samsung UN46B8500 or the 46XBR8. Although I might have been happy with either, I went with the XBR8 because: 1) overall positive experience with the Sony line of TVs,  2) the very positive reviews, including recommendations from Consumer Report, PC Mag and CNET, and 3) Sony was several hundred dollars cheaper than the Samsung (though not so when the XBR8 first debut at the mind boggling price of 5K). I scoured brick and mortar stores to check it out and came online to ensure I was not overpaying. Because Chicago city sales taxes (10.5%, if you care) are outrageously disproportionate with what it provides in needed social services (you wouldn't believe the lawsuits our tax dollars fight because of stupid politicians), I decided to buy the TV online from OneCall. The folks there were totally professional and the TV arrived in no time without incident.  The delivery guy was more excited about it than I was.Out of the box, the TV was terrific. The colors are spectacular. The reds, blues, green and blacks are inspiring.  I love this TV. If you buy a TV for the added gadgets, like online connectivity, perhaps the Samsung would be a better choice. The XBR8 was at least 1.5 years older than the Samsung model and I still choose the Sony model. In term of sheer picture quality and viewing experience, it is simply breathtaking. I have not even had it professionally calibrated yet. Playing with the settings you may decide not to have it done.  An argument can be made that the lines of XBRs that followed the XBR 8 have still not lived up to the technology Sony placed in this TV.  My research into this TV reveals that the reason Sony stopped carrying over the XBR8 technology into the newer models is because it would have been cost prohibitive, thus the new models never lived up to the XBR8 model. Viewing this TV you will see why.  However, if the comparison is between those newer XBR lines and the Samsung 8500, then Samsung may likely be the better buy.  It all depends on how you rank your needs.But for a few issues endemic to all LEDs, watching this TV you can easily believe you are watching a super expensive plasma. It is that good. Some folks have complained about off angle viewing (which apparently plagues all LEDs), I have yet to have any of those issues.I do not part with my money easily and I kept asking myself after the purchase whether in this economy it is wise laying out 2K for a TV (peer pressure and all).  I am still not sure about the answer, but man, am I loving this TV!! (and so are all my friends).

I received an email right after the sale. The next day I received a call from Onecall to let me know the T.V was being shipped and an email would be coming with a tracking number. What really blew my mind is that when Onecall called me I was never asked to buy anything else, how refreshing that was from other buys I had made on the Internet. The trucking company called (Conway trucking) and gave me a time they would deliver the T.V; they were with in two minutes of the time they said they would be here. The deliver was for curbside delivery only, but to my surprise the Conway driver offered to help me get the TV in to the house for me.So in my opinion spend the extra money and get a XBR8, you will just love the quality of the picture you get.

My living room gets a lot of ambient light and I could not afford to put a TV in there with a glossy screen.  The XBR8 is perfect.  There is little to no reflection off the screen, which allows me to see a clearer more accurate picture.

We continued to use the tv without trouble until the picture went off a short time later and a message appeared on the screen, \"No signal. Check the external input or select another input using the input button.\" After fiddling around with it, checking connections, and requesting another cable reset, we called OneCall where the set was purchased from Amazon. It turned out to be the best customer service we have ever experienced. The customer service representative called Sony while we were on the line and stayed with us during the entire negotiations process, offering advice and support throughout. Sony offered us a reburbished model, which we rejected, and then offered to fix the tv if we paid for the expense in packaging it and sending it to a Sony plant on the West Coast, which we also rejected. Sony wanted to avoid the cost associated with travel and service from the nearest Sony authorized repair service 70 miles away. Finally, we were referred to a Sony supervisor who authorized the repairs. OneCall did not end its assistance until the motherboard had been installed and the tv was up and running perfectly. Their support and advice led to the best possible outcome for us: keeping the tv and having it repaired in our home. We never anticipated a problem with this tv, an expensive set that was carefully researched before purchase, certainly not within a warranty period. The degree to which OneCall goes to ensure the best outcome for their customers is truly extraordinary. We feel confident purchasing electronic equipment from OneCall and in recommending them.

As someone stated before in a previous review, I received an email, then a follow-up call after purchasing from Amazon.  No problems with shipping either.  Now for the TV... Back in December of last year, I had purchased a Vizio (551XVT) from Costco.  I had that TV for 3 months, then returned it because it had \"shadowing\" on the screen.  Basically, there was a blemish in the middle of my 55\" that I couldn't tolerate since I shelled out 2K.  It was a good TV, not great.  I then decided to try an LG (55LH90) which was also a good TV, even better than the Vizio.  I decided I was going to keep that until I saw this TV drop in price dramatically.  Both of the previous Tv's had the local dimming/backlit like this one, but the difference is Sony's red, green and blue bulbs that I think make a difference in picture quality.  Everyone's taste is different and people will tell you that their TV rivals anyone else's...blah,blah,blah.  I'm not one to go and brag about a purchase, but I will tell you to check this TV out as it is worth the price.  It's two years old, but I can tell you it's as good as the LCD's/ Plasmas that are coming out today.  I researched mainly LCD's because glare is an issue in my living room.  No problem there as this TV has a matte screen.  Ironically, I was looking at the new models this year and many of them have the ultra-clear panel, which is glossy.  I think the 3-d Tv's are nice, but to me, if I'm going to watch 3-D, it will be in a theater, not in my home.  Plus, there isn't much content out right now to justify dropping 3-4k.  Once I got this TV hooked up and got the settings to my liking, I was very impressed and happy that I waited.  It probably won't be in stores anymore as it is 2 years old.  But, see for yourself, read all the other reviews and go to CNet too as they gave this TV a really good score.  I am very picky and don't have any quams about returning products if their not up to my standards.  I ordered this blindly and would definately recommend it.

Furthermore, I just realized the LCD panel is actually made by Samsung NOT Sony. If you buy a Sony TV; why is the LCD Panel (the most important and expensive part of the TV) is made in Korea by Samsung.  The picture might be good but how long will it last.....for me it only lasted 1 year and 4 months.  Also If you do a simple search on Amazon you will find that Amazon does not sell Sony XBR LCD TV directly anymore since I guess they have so many complaints from their customers on the Sony LCD TV. Go ahead look and see you can find Amazon selling Sony XBR LCD TV directly...Amazon actually refer you to another brand like LG or other brands when you are looking any Sony XBR LCD TVs.....and my Full Story below:5/9/2010- I brought the Sony XBR series TV on Amazon about 1 year and 4 months ago and now the TV have failed. The picture quality was amazing until just yesterday the picture started to degrade and now it has green clouds and rainbows all over the pictures. I just call the Sony authorize tech service from they said it will cost me $75 for the in house service since it's out of warranty. They also said that if it's the LCD panels has failed then it would cost as much as the TV itself. This is my first LCD from Sony but I have 3 other Sony TVs- 1 30\" Sony CRT, 1 47\" XBR rear projection and 1 65\" XBR rear projection TV. All the previous Sony TVs had no problem at all and I am still using the 65\" rear projection TV. What happen to Sony's quality and reliability product? I guess it went to the same place as other first rated Japanese products like Toyota. They are just too busy on cutting cost and lower their reliabilities so they can rack in the billion dollars profit. So if you like the picture quality of Sony TVs; be advice to buy their extended warranty.  I wish I did because if the LCD panel failed then my LCD TV is just a big 52\" black picture frame hanging on the wall.  If you really, really have to get a Sony XBR LCD TV then I would recommend to get 5 years extended warranty plan for $299-it will save you a lot of frustration. And after 5 years, you will probably do a upgrade anyway.5/11/2010 update: Today the tech came and verified that the LCD panel has gone bad after 1 year and 4 months of service. In the tech's own words-the panel is a factory defect since it should not failed after just a little over a year of service and that I should call Sony and see they will reimburse the cost of the panel. I am so disappointed on the product since I did not just buy any Sony TV but the top of the line XBR series TV. I called Sony and told them the whole story but they just told me to fax all the documents -receipt and repair cost to Sony and they will evaluate it. I will wait and see what happen - but at this point I am really disappointed and frustrated with the whole thing! :-(Update: 5/13/2010-Just received a call from Sony \"Customer Relations\" today.  It's official-Sony don't stand behind their products.  They will not pay for the cost of their defective LCD panel since it's out of warranty (1 year) after 1 year and 4 month of service. They just lost a loyal customer. No more Sony products in my house.  Sony customer relations representative even has the nerve to offer me $900 reimbursement on a $$3517.75 repair cost. That's right-I will have to pay $2617.76 to fix my $2018.88 LCD TV.  So if you buy a Sony TV and you have a defective LCD panel after 1 year of use then you can just throw that TV in the trash because Sony will tell you go F yourself and trash the TV.  Good luck on buying a Sony LCD TV because you going to need it-and looks like from my research, I am not the only customer that have a defect LCD panel after 1 year.  In fact, the LCD panel is not even made by Sony but Samsung made in Korea.  Samsung LCD Panels have notoriously for premature failure of their LCD panels.
