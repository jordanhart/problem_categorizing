I got it for my son for christmas and he really likes it. The picture is really good. The only thing Im not sure of is the sound it seems to have an echo or muffled.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the young at heart", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R1W1HMHLSCECLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not very familiar with Hannspree TV's, but the picture quality is good for the price and hook up is easy. The only thing I would recommend changing is speaker placement so the sound could be heard better. Fortunately you are able to connect speakers to a place on the back for better sound, so when there are lots of friends over and some are watching a movie and others are playing around we turn the speakers on. Looks great in a sports themed room. Young kids love it!", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent themed/shaped television", "Author": "ddj", "ReviewID": "R11OSDOF2JGV87", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased at Costco and were initially attracted to its unique shape/theme since it matched our son's bedroom theme of sports.  However, it is a great performing television overall, excellent color, large, easy to use front buttons and a fun theme also.  Now hooked up to an x-box for the boys to play in their media/play room.  An awesome purchase!  Totally love it!  Highly recommend", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great choice for a football fan!", "Author": "MomB", "ReviewID": "R1GGEDP91ZGG96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this product over two years ago for my grandson.

I bought one for my son and when it failed after 4 months, I had to mail it to Hannspree (in CA) at my cost ($60).  After I got it back 3 weeks later, they hadn't fixed it. Thus I had to mail it to them a 2nd time (at their cost), 3 weeks or so later I got it back...guess what, IT STILL ISN\"T FIXED!!. Avoid this TV and the manufacturer like the bubonic plague.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture", "Author": "Rhonda Myers", "ReviewID": "RVXFGROB9MK34", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for my son, and he loves it.

Very cool, goes great in his 'Bears' room. Great HD picture that rivals my Sony, especially for a non major brand, but if you're not watching HD its just OK.
