Vizio is known for it's better-than-average picture quality. However, it is not appraised due to \"its lack of quality speakers\" (as many people said on their reviews of other Vizio TVs). I received my TV one day earlier than it had been scheduled for even with Prime.Pros:Prompt delivery.Crisp picture quality.I find no fault in the sound quality or output.Easy set-up.Cons:Packaging prevents the TV from rattling around, but doesn't do so well in protecting the screen.The Vizio logo below the screen will turn off while it is on (after selecting that option) but it remains on while the TV is off.Altogether great TV.P.S. Don't let the 720p be the determining factor. I asked my friend, who takes many factors into consideration when buying anything, if I should purchase a TV with 1080p. I ended up taking his advice and buying this TV. \"You will not really notice the difference in definition on a 32 inch.\"", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great bargain for the price!", "Author": "Douglas Burroughs", "ReviewID": "R2LRZEFDQSM3SC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have owned a Vizio 32\" for two years now and have found it to be an incredible TV for the price.Picture Quality: Although a you can get a higher rate 1080, at this size I agree with the other reviewer, it really doesn't matter right now. You can adjust the picture in a simple menu. The quality of the picture is excellent. We watch a lot of sports, including hockey and we have had an excellent experience with something so small as the puck.Sound: The embedded speakers are a little thin in sound, so we recommend easily enhancing with either TV or computer speakers. There are some generic EQ settings for Classical, Flat, Jazz, Rock, etc.  If the TV is not on, you cannot send music through it to a separate system. It would be nice if you could by-pass the visual and send music through.Inputs: Our version has two HDMI inputs. Our only critique would be an input on the remote to access the VGA input (we attach a separate CPU as a media center). Other than that, it is an amazing T.V.Shipping: We purchased ours local so we have no history with this.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great product at awesome price", "Author": "K.

I watched the news that morning and got home in the evening it would not do anything. I called them and was told I had to email them a copy of the sales sheet and when they got it I was told the replacement is on the way. two weeks later it got here, unpack it hooked it all up and it did not work called tech support did all kind of things once again they asked me to send them  pictures of what it was doing did that next day I was told if I got the bad tv  sent off that day, they told me I would get another replacement in 3-5 days. I did all they told me to do and two weeks later still no replacement. Called again to check on it gave them all people I talked to about this with badge numbers and that did no good at all a replacement that should have ship the same day I ship back the first replacement did not go out until 9 days later. Even those I was told it would ship the same day I was told I would just have to wait on the replacement. I was also told by a supervisor he would check into it and call me back and have not heard a word. All a company have in their word and they did not stand behind their product a new tv that only lasted six months. I have other Vizio product and was planning to get more, but now that has all changed. Will go with someone that will stand behind their product and not just tell you something to get you off the phone. The fist Vizio tv I bought went back in four days tv just lost the color. If you do buy this tv you might want to buy some exact protection. Will let you know how long the second replacement last. I was also told the the replacement would be a new tv. It would be one the went out to stores and they did not sell them and  so they was sent back to Vizio. Both were factory re certified.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "green screen", "Author": "cyd0421", "ReviewID": "R2R6ATE069NTI9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I had it installed the cable guy told me that when you change from HD to non HD, the screen turns blue for a few seconds.
