Check on line you will see I'm not the only one having this problem.So if you are looking for a TV with a good product support in case there is a problem buy from another manufacture.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little TV for a good price!", "Author": "Kelli", "ReviewID": "R2YZY5FLYF33K3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm surprised there aren't more reviews for this product! Picture is amazing! Hooked it up to my PS3 with an HDMI cable, and the graphics and detail are superb! Beautiful, sharp, vibrant colors. Very clear. Good price for a 1080p. Nice outward appearance, too! Very sharp-looking, lightweight, and thin, too! The only thing that is not outstanding about this TV is the sound. But hey, that was to be expected with a TV this size. Some computer speakers should do the trick. Overall, I love this TV!!!! Very happy with this purchase. :)", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the $$$", "Author": "Guin White", "ReviewID": "R1O6BM93ON7X8H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Considering it only cost $189, this was a good purchase. I like the fact that the set is full HD and LED. It has a nice picture and is just the right size for our small condo. We purchased this to replace a(n even smaller) Sharp Aquos, and are happy with it so far.The only annoyance worth mentioning is that the TV's speaker isn't very good. Quite weak, in fact, especially when connected to digital cable which is notorious for knocking down a TV's audio capabilities. Luckily, we figured this would be the case and bought a set of small speakers when we got the TV. Worked like a charm.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good TV", "Author": "M. Okada", "ReviewID": "R1OWMQ819KQJSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had my doubts purchasing a Polaroid TV, but this item was on sale at Target for $180 and I wanted to purchase a set with full HD.  So far I am absolutely happy with my TV.  The picture is beautiful, the sound is fine, and all of my standard DVD's look incredible on this TV.  Some full screen DVD's, especially the old Wonder Woman and Incredible Hulk shows from the 70's are nearly Blu-Ray quality on my new TV.  I can't believe how much detail on standard DVD's is simply lost on the old analog TV's (and my last TV was a Sony Trinitron!)  I was almost going to purchase a Phillips 19\" set but I'm glad I got this one.  I have no desire for a very large TV, but I have found that a 22\" set is a lot easier to watch than a 19\" set.  My only complaint is that I don't know how difficult it will be to find a replacement remote control--the \"input\" buttons on the other remotes I own don't work on this Polaroid set (however there is a manual \"input\" button on the back of the set for switching between TV and DVD input, just in case I lose my remote).", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Did not last long!  Great picture.", "Author": "t1meband1t", "ReviewID": "R1PLQQAJ91ZXPI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in June of 2012 and the picture just went out 13 months later. Audio still works.  Hardly ever used.  Great picture while it lasted.Update: Having nothing to lose I decided to take the cover off the tv and check for blown capacitors.  Everything looked good.  Then I noticed the plug to the lcd screen appeared not to be plugged in all the way.  The right corner seemed unlatched so I just pushed it in all the way and presto....the display now works. I don't know why it worked for a year that way or if that was the real problem.  Only time will tell.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "try finding one that works", "Author": "Christine A.

Exchanged it for another - that had 1 bad sector and decided 1 dot was okay to live with rather than the hassle.  The other looked like it was okay...until about a week later when the cable input stopped working.

I works wonderfully, beautiful picture good sound. I have cable, DVD and VCR hooked up and all work great. I wanted to connect to my wireless but I misplaced the manual and cannot get another from Polaroid. I've sent requests with no reply. Upon reading other comments many other people have the same problem. So as long as you do not have to contact customer support this is a great TV.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Such disappointment", "Author": "francis", "ReviewID": "R1P5MCCO6UTOIH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I LOVED this TV and bought it at a great deal on Black Friday about 4 months ago. I recently noticed a dead pixel on it and tried to get it exchanged, but the grace period at the store I purchased it at was up and they said I would have to contact the manufacturer. When I called Polaroid, it was so frustrating because they were clearly just reading a manual and said that a dead pixel isn't covered under their warranty. Man, after being spoiled with Apple's customer service and Samsung's quality products, I was extremely upset and disappointed that they seemed content with dead pixel TVs. They said one dead pixel is not a faulty product, but come on, it's been only 4 months and maybe my TV turns on but a dead pixel is NOT normal! The guy was like \"its just one dead pixel\"... Okay, that's the kind of attitude I'd have towards a TV I had for like 5 years, but for 4 months? There's something wrong with that. Negative 5 stars for poor customer service and low product standards.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV so far", "Author": "eric keith", "ReviewID": "R2OAAFERCWTHH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv has a better picture and sound than a Vizio I am returning. I think it is a great value for the price. The picture is very good and can be adjusted with a number of settings - only thing missing is back light level. However, the black level is very respectable, and needed only a slight tinkering on brightness, contrast and color level to achieve a very good picture. Sound is very good through headphones. There are bass and treble controls, or even equalizer that can be custom set. One cannot expect high quality sound out of the small speakers in these smaller tv's. I cannot yet comment on the life expectancy of this tv as some have complained of early failure. At this point, the tv is performing flawlessly. I will amend as time goes on if needed.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004KRA1OE"}}
