It has forward facing speakers so the sound is very good, and the picture quality, especially on the 1080 stations is just beautiful. The difference between CRT and digital is pretty amazing.It has an easy to use remote, setting up is easy, and if you're a newbie like me (any left?), more intricate setting up like subtitles and such takes a min. or so but it's pretty straight forward.I know there are much more expensive brands and TV's with more bells and whistles but if you want 26\" with very good sound and beautiful picture quality, this is a great choice.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "BUYER BEWARE!", "Author": "Clayton Young \"ClaySF\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZZRVAGFJPN2A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "BUYER BEWARE:  Vizio will not honor warranty if you purchase \"from an unauthorized reseller.\"  And good luck determining which sellers are authorized before you buy!  Our set developed a line of dead pixels three months after we bought it.  Vizio tech support determined that it was indeed a warranty-covered flaw and agreed to exchange it for a new unit.  Then, two hours later they called to renege on the agreement, asserting that the Amazon third party dealer we purchased from was \"unauthorized.\"  As for Amazon, it refused to help because warranty issues are not part of the alphabet in their \"A-Z Guaranty.\"  I have no idea if Vizio's warranty exclusion is industry standard. But in my opinion it exposes a serious flaw in Amazon's business model if customers, searching for lowest prices on a given item, are not warned that by purchasing through Amazon.com, you may be voiding the manufacturer warranty. In future I, for one, will think twice before buying any electronic or other consumer product from Amazon.com.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Shut off the gimmicks & use the custom settings", "Author": "J. Pawlowski", "ReviewID": "R1GA8NIHJD66MF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Contrast ratio seems to be around 1200:1 when comparing it to my other LCDs with known contrast ratios. Forget about \"dynamic\" contrast ratios. The term is almost meaningless, & a gimmick. Speaking of gimmicks this set is loaded with almost useless gimmicks or features that sound good in writing, but just make the TV look & sound terrible if you use them. The factory picture mode presets must have be made by a blind person. All of them make the picture blurry, & over saturated with color to the point all flesh tones look bright blurry deep orange. The overall picture scene looks like it was shot under those ugly yellow-orange sodium-vapor streetlights.It would have been nice if at least 1 or 2 of the picture mode presets looked fair.The good news is if you use the custom settings, you can make the picture look as good, clear, & sharp as any good TV... as long as you don't need a super-bright picture. Pushing the brightness or contrast too high will result in an over washed, over pushed picture with poor color, & people looking cartoon-like. I suggest contrast & brightness settings of 33-50 for  most evening viewing, but no higher than 50 or you'll loose a lot of quality. Color at 28, sharpness at 17.LEDs get dimmer over time the harder you push them, & the more you use them. So a lower back-light setting will make your LEDs stay bright longer. I currently have the LED back-light set at 40, & I don't recommend leaving it higher than 60 very long.Set adaptive luma off, it's terrible. Set color enhancement off too. In the custom color temp settings, R gain 70, G gain 50, B gain 53, R offset 53, G offset 50, B offset 54.Noise reduction off, but for a real grainy or blocky picture it helps a little on high. Ambient light sensor off.In Audio, SRS TruSurround is terrible. Leave it off. TruVolume on. Equalizer settings off. Bass & Treble at 0 (flat). Turning up the bass won't give you bass. It'll boost the lower midrange a little, & make the dialog sound like someone's speaking through a hollow toilet roll tube. The sound is almost as bad as it is in my laptop which only has a pair of 1/4\"x3/4\" speakers in it. Shutting off almost all the gimmicks made it sound best. Regardless what they say the sound power is, I'd guess it's only 1/8 to 1/4 a watt per side.TruVolume does turn down some loud commercials & some loud scenes. But other times it seems to randomly & erratically turn the sound up & down for no reason. Had to turn up the volume almost all the way on some quiet channels, then turn it down almost all the way on some loud channels.It picked up 1 more channel off the air than any of my other TVs did. Channels did not cut out or pixelate during bad weather like they did on my other TVs too. So the tuner is above average.I also have a PC connected to this for a dual display. Disappointed that none of the color & sharpness settings function, when displaying the PC. These worked on my other TVs when connected to a PC. Really don't want to ruin my graphics card settings when playing Netflix through it. The terrible adaptive luma (a useless annoying gimmick) can't be shut off when displaying the PC either.4 stars for being a beautiful picture with customs settings for what I paid for it & shipping. 1 star off for loading it full of useless or terrible gimmicks, features, & factory presets obviously set up by a blind deaf person. I can see a lot of people not used to tweaking their TV settings sending this unit back. Out of the box, using the factory & default settings, this is a terrible TV.Wish I could find how to access the service menu to fix some of the presets to something useful & watchable, but the old tricks to get to the Vizio service menu don't seem to work on this model. What's the new service mode/menu sequence on these newer models?", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice for the Price", "Author": "S.

Even when viewed from the correct height, the contrast is average at best, and I'm saying that after having tried all the built in picture options including the custom setting that I tinkered with for nearly half an hour.

But last week, the left side of the screen started getting a bright section to it, and the right side was dark. Then it would go black altogether after a few minutes on. I called VIZIO and they said it was under warranty and that they would ship me a re certified one  a few inches bigger. Then they told me they would have to charge my credit card the amount I originally paid for the TV, and once my broken TV was shipped back satisfactorily, they would credit my credit card. Well, it's been 2 weeks since they charged my card. The tracking number from UPS says a label has been made but the item not yet shipped. In my opinion, this is terrible customer service. They should have sent me a new TV the very next day! Plus, I forgot to mention, I had to physically take 2 pictures of the screen and email it to them before they would even listen to my case.

On-board sound is reasonable, but I am running a little pair of computer speakers for extra bass and volume outside.  Plugged in to the headphone jack, the add-on speakers are controlled with the romote control which is nice.  I am running it on coax cable at standard def, and it has the normal amount of graininess I see on my other standard def TVs.  I have not tried this 720p with an HD signal, although I expect a Vizio will do just fine in this mode.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "secondary TV", "Author": "Dale R.

It's a great tv for the price and the picture and sound are really nice as well.I would definitely consider another Vizio when I upgrade my flat panel.My only two complaints are that the package was delivered - and left on my front stoop for all the world to see.Good thing it wasn't stolen.It was delivered two days prior to the notice I was given in the shipping email, and it was just in the manufacturer's box.  Nothing to \"hide\" the fact of what it was.  That brings up my other problem.  Since it was shipped this way and I was not home to get it as I planned to be - my daughter saw it and so she got her Christmas present a week ahead of time.Perhaps if I would have said, that this was a gift - maybe it would have been shipped differently? - I don't know.Overall it's a nice tv and she is happy with it.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good set for the price.", "Author": "TOM", "ReviewID": "R3O27B28XUVR72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The tv has a crisp bright picture which adjusts nicely as the room light changes.
