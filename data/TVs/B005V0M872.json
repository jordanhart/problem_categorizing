It replaced a Mitsubishi DLP 57\", that I really likeda lot. It had a fantastic image, but just after the warranty expired,it started having white dots all over. After a month, it had so manywhite dots I just couldn't stand it and had to get something new.Hooked my new 60\" LCD up to the Timewarner HD box and it looks AWESOME!!Just watched Jets vs Giants, and the image and response was perfect.No ghosting, no lag, no blur, no pixelation on moving objects. Didn't usethe 240hz mode, the 120hz high mode is better. I did have to adjustthe default settings to get it the way I like it. I found a list of settings someoneon the Costco website used and they were about exactly how I like it.A couple minor changes and the picture can't be beat. Bright, clear, sharploads of color, but not so vibrant that it hurts to look at.I have my audio piped through a ProLogic II rig, so I don't usethe TVs audio feature. That seemed to be a sore point with some other reviewers.and talk about thin! Almost as thin as the 22\" LCD on my desk.I haven't even used the WiFi feature or any other goodies, but so far... 5 stars.If that changes I'll be sure to update my review.----------------------Settings I changed:Under Picture Settings:AV Mode = StandardOPC = OFFBacklight = +6Contrast = +30Brightness = -2Color = +2Tint = 0Sharpness = +2Under: Picture Setting advancedColor Temp = MiddleMotion Enhancement = 240hz OFF, use 120hz highActive Contrast = ONGamma Adjustment = 0Film Mode = StandardDigital Noise Reduction = AutoOverscan/Image Size = Dot by Dot", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "STAY AWAY FROM SHARP TV's", "Author": "briannawilsey", "ReviewID": "R7LVYOI3ITQVE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this T.V. from Costco a little over a year ago and it is shot!  The set has a lamp error, which means that the replacement part and repair costs more than the set is worth.  The Internet is replete with customers' complaints about this model as well as other Sharp models having the same problem. I contacted Sharp, who told me that this was such a common and huge problem with their sets, that they would go beyond the one-year warranty to do the right thing. Then, within two hours, the same rep from Sharp called me and told me that they changed their minds and I would have to take  care of everything myself.  Basically, I was out about $1600.00!  When a company's product has a common and major inherent problem, they should stand behind their product and be kind to their customers. This T.V. was nothing special. Their Customer Service behaved despicably. Please read the customer reviews of Sharp's customer service on the internet. They are atrocious. I will NEVER purchase another Sharp product again in my life. I wanted to help others avoid the same plight.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good TV but Internet Experience needs improvement", "Author": "Ish \"Ish\"", "ReviewID": "R1RYHVIK7RT981", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sharp Aquos 60\" LED 1080p 240Hz HDTV LC-60LE633UGood Picture quality. Sound is decent for a TV of such slim dimensions. Mapping apps to your favorite apps physical buttons on the remote is a nice touch. Network connectivity is good. I have tried both wireless and wired. Settled on the wired connection as that is more reliable and higher bandwidth. Excellent for accessing your pictures, home videos and music from your Network Drive - I have a seagate 2 Terabyte GoFlex network attached drive. Very convenient to stream your pictures, videos and music to the TV. Takes most video formats - even AVCHD.Cons -* No support for Amazon Prime Video - Big drawback for all the folks who have Amazon Prime. I wish Sharp adds that as a software update.* AQUOS Net - which is Sharps answer to a browser and apple apps - leaves a lot to be desired. Navigation and user experience couldn't be worse.* I have not checked for HULU app but others have commented the lack of Hulu on this TV.With more and more TVs connected to the Internet, manufacturers have to either keep their proprietary apps and interfaces updated (even on older TVs) or move towards a standard TV platform (aka GoogleTV) where other companies and individual provide apps in a common marketplace.I actually bought the set from Costco. Price was very competitive and their no-hassle return policy made this a no-brainer decision.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great large screen TV - minor drawbacks", "Author": "James Ridgway", "ReviewID": "R34BYSE3QN92T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We upgraded to an LED TV from our older 42\" Plasma TV - that Panasonic did a decent job over the six years we owned it, however I have to say that after seven months of use I am exceedingly pleased with the new 60 inch Aquos.Pros:- LARGE - 60 inch TV is almost like having a mini movie theater. Really love the large screen.- Sharp! The detail is amazing. Excellent contrast - great color - overall very nice! Almost too sharp really - see Cons below.- Low power consumption. LED lit LCD is great for lowering your power consumption.- Good connections. Even has a fiber connection - very nice.- Free customer support line - LOVE that feature - yet the customer support techs aren't typically very knowledgable.Cons:- This should really be a 5-star TV here's why it isn't:- 240Hz is really too much - the sharpness you receive from this makes everything look 'fake' or like watching a play. It's VERY distracting especially at first. Signals aren't sent in 240Hz and we actually had to reduce it to 120Hz to make it more watchable.- In-TV Apps don't play well - This is my largest issue with this TV - the in-TV apps aren't well supported. Also, when using an in-TV app, the sound does not go through the 'normal' route and I had to push it through the fiber connection to get sound through the Amp - When I'm watching Netflix that's a major issue!- Online updates DON'T Work! We connected to the network without much issue - however the online updates simply do not work - it has never updated properly. FAIL!At the end of the day it's a superb TV at a decent price - the extra bells and whistles fall short and make it less than it could be.UPDATE - 9 April 2012Increase from four to five stars based on the following:- The latest software update was actually able to download - first one since we got it - so they fixed that problem - excellent.- The In-TV apps work much better now! Netflix in particular is far simpler than it used to be.The TV as it stands now is superior.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dead TV", "Author": "TV-LESS", "ReviewID": "R1ZWZVWY5XW61D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The worst customer service in the WORLD!

At first I was looking at 55\" tv's thinking that I would not find another 60\" without going to plasma or back to DLP. I was surprised to see a similar model ( Sharp 60\" led 120hz) going on sale black friday. I found this TV at a local store and bought it seeing that it was twice the TV I was looking at buying. So far So good. It almost makes everything look and play so detailed it is like you are there and you could shake the hands with the actors at any-point. I never knew a TV could look this good. I found a great deal on this TV because the shop owner apparently need to get some sells but I would recommend this TV to anyone that is even thinking about getting a 55\" TV.The Good:Internet compatible with dual-band wireless NBlack is BLACK!!Details pop out at youThe TV gives a great sense of Depth ( almost seems 3D on some HD Shows)The BadNO HULU!! I know it is minor but my Blu-ray player doesn't have it either and I have a subscription so I have to watch through my XBOX.Because of the 240 hz it takes a while to get used to. It may make your movies look almost \"cheap\"there is such fluidity and Detail it almost looks to life like.

I couldn't be happier with the picture quality and even the sound isn't that bad for coming out of the TV. I don't have a sound system connected to it. I have had 2 or 3 upgrades come through for the TV. The first one wouldn't load from the automatic update so I downloaded it from Sharp and installed it without any issues at all. The other updates have been fine since when doing them through the TV menu. Netflix is the only app that I really use on it and I am very happy with that. I really like that when watching TV episodes it will automatically play the next one in the series, up to three times I think then it asks if you're still there or not. I have used all of the features of the TV and have no real complaints. I would have given five stars if they would have Amazon Prime Instant video on it as well. Remote stopped working one day, no response at all. Bought a new one on Amazon for about $20 from SharpSharp Remote Control RRMCGA935WJSA. I originally bought the TV and put it on a TV stand. After having it for about a year I mounted it onto a Cheetah Mounts Plasma LCD Flat Screen TV Articulating Full Motion Dual Arm Wall Mount Bracket For 32-65 inches Displays Up To 165LBS Black With 10 cm High Speed HDMI Cable With Ethernet Fits Up To 24 feet Studs. Looks fantastic.Pros:  Great TV for the price  Awesome picture quality  Deep black quality  Has both wi-fi and wired(prefer wired)  Playing PS3 on it looks fantasticNeither pro nor con:  Remote stopped working after about 6 months. No big deal to me since we punish it.  More updates will be nice to get more apps on the TVCons:  This may seem odd, but one of the cons is the fact that the power cord is on the opposite side of the on plugs and whatnot on the TV. Wasn't really much of an issue until I went to put the TV onto a wall mount.  The remote is a little flimsy, I want a little more weight in my hand when I use the remote. Really thin and slim.

I know very little about them but do know when something works and looks good. This TV does both. The picture is clear and crisp. It is an excellent size for our game room and can be seen from across the room. It arrived in perfect condition and the added bonus is we didn't have to drag it into the car from some appliance store then back into the house. The delivery man was nice enough to carry it into the house for me.  We ordered a piece to attach it to the wall and I gather it installed easily. (Didn't hear any loud noises coming from the game room at any rate.) My husband and son had it installed very quickly.

I kept seeing a \"halo effect\" around the bright or white objects, but maybe it was just my eyes. My husband said he didn't notice it. We checked back with Costco just to see if the price had dropped at all after the new year, and ended up getting this Sharp Aquos t.v. as well.  We brought it home and compared it to the Vizio and, OMG!  What a difference!  The picture was so clear and the size was great for our bonus room.  Every night we have watched it, at least one of us has said, \"I can't believe how clear the picture is!\"  It was like the actors/actresses were right there in the room with you.  Of course my husband tested the \"game quality\" by watching some NFL and as much as I don't like football, I'd have to admit that it was one of (if not THE) best picture of a football game I have ever watched.  There are multiple picture setting you can choose to enhance what you are watching, and the Dynamic setting was perfect for sports - the colors were so vibrant.So, although it was about $500 more than the Vizio, I'm glad we made the switch.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV Great Price!", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R3OMBOAIIT2BRK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE IT!

The repair shop called the next day Wed an stated they had to order parts. They would cancel and reschedule when  the parts came in. 7PM service tech called to confirm Thursday AM appointment. I asked of they had gotten the parts already and he stated yes. 30 minutes later the same service repair tech called back and indicated the parts were for a different customer and that my parts would take up to a week to get. On Sunday, I returned the TV out of box to Costco for a full no hassel refund. Took the money + $400 and bought a Panasonic 60 inch GT30  Plasma that after 2 weeks I am very happy with. Especially like the texturing, depth of color and motion. This is my 3rd Panasonic Plasma in 6 years and I still use all the 37\" 50\" and now 60\" sof far never an issue and always pleased.Time to drop to 1 star from 3 stars. This morning just 2 weeks into ownership, tv fails to power on, flashing code on led of 2 fast 2 slow repetatively. Will see and give feedback on Sharp support. I hear they dispatch repair people to the house. This TV now meets my Criteria of if it breaks, I will never buy another Product from them.Bought the Sharp 60 inch 633 from Costco after some reviews and watching it in store. For me, I should have stayed with a Plasma. I have yet to find a quality picture setting as skin tones vary widely from a flat pale to a clayish to a red splotched and lip colors can appear to be very pinkish and not natural at times(even on men). Maybe this is just from having a large screen and they really are using lip coloring in the filming?  I have tried several color settings that were online recomendations and have yet to find a happy medium. The reds appear more magenta to pinkish at times. Watching the Stanford Oklahoma game was a trial as the colors of the oranges and the reds on the jerseys appeared to shift and not be the natural deeper red colors and orange.Also depending on the Angle of view, the colors tend to dull and lose teh crispness almost whiting out a little. Have a chair over at an angle around 45 degrees and about 10 feet away, the picture quality is not as clean and crisp as from directly in front.I also like hockey and watching sports, I have noticed the blur from a fast pace or a jitter from sudden back and forth movement as well as what looks like a slow bending during a slow movement seen of a longer straight line.I do like the ability to retrieve videos and pictures from my PC. I do not however like the user interface for Netflix as it is not as graceful as a web browser on a PC.The lip and skin coloring is the most anoying and making me want to replace the TV with a LG Plasma. I find it hard to throw out $1400 dollars though. Maybe in a year if the 60 inch plasmas drop to under $700", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sharpless", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "RFI300HM1HYFX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV because the picture was awesome at the store and I've always owned Plasmas and wanted to try something new. When i got home and watched a movie in HD the picture was perfect and had no complaints, thought this was the best TV ever. After the movie I started watching football and thats when i started seeing the 240hz difference compaired to the plasmas 600hz. The football and the players when in fast motion they where blurry. It wasn't that bad to were i was getting mad. I didn't get mad until i tried to play video games and the lag was horrible. I tried to calibrate the game three times to the TV and the TV could not keep up with the game. The next morning I took the TV back and bought a 59\" Samsung Plasma and have no complaints yet.
