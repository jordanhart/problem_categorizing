AT this price, this is a great deal on a TV that best suited for a secondary TV, not your main media display. It's only a 720P, and the viewing angle with good color is narrow. Having said that, the TV is reliable, hangs easily on the wall, and works. If you can find this TV for under $350, it's a great deal. Over $400 and you should spring for an LED with a better viewing angle.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Junk!", "Author": "Andy J", "ReviewID": "RW14F5A9LL7I6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Junk!  Purchased from Sams Club in December 2011.  It is now May 25th, 2012 and this unit is toast.  A very quick call to Magnavox's tech support line, and the lady on the other end told me the unit is defective and to contact their warranty company... between the hours of 9 AM and 6 PM eastern time, Monday through Friday.  It's currently 9:30 EST on a Friday... I have to wait at least 2 days to even start the warranty process on my TV, and that's assuming I can get time off from work to do so.TV was decent while it worked, but Magnavox as a company is a joke.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "best I've had", "Author": "Tyna", "ReviewID": "R1Q38YP060YL9Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love this TV!!!!!!!!!!! really, I have to add a minimum amount of words?

The picture is nice and the controls are all pretty user friendly.  If I have any complaints it is the base of the TV.  We do not want to hang this TV on the wall so we set up the stand that it came with.  I followed the directions and screwed the 3 screws in as far as they can go without stripping the phillips heads on them.  I placed the TV on our dresser and it is very wobbly.  It sways quite a bit with even the gentlest of touches.  It makes me very nervous to see it rocking and wobbling so easily.  This is the only setback to an otherwise great TV that we got at an excellent price!  All of the other features are impressive and if the base was tight and secure I would have given this TV a 5 star rating.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "37\" Philips Magnavox HD 720p 1366x768 USB HDMI w/ Speakers Black LCD TV 37MF301B 37MF301B/F7", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31GkoTqwHxL.jpg", "ProductID": "B004WQ7N1W"}}
