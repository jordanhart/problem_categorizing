I was looking for a thin bodied hdtv for bluray and hi-def sports viewing, basically a no frills, quality hdtv viewing experience.With 2 hdmi ports, a usb port, ybr connections, and a coaxial input, I give a thumbs up to connectivity  (some might need more hdmi inputs, but I'm happy with two).The picture quality is fantastic, very nice deep blacks, and no image flicker to speak of. The 600hz refresh rate produces a beautiful, full and detailed image.I found the tv user interface to be straight forward, easy to learn, and easy to use. The menu is very soft on the eyes, and is no ways invasive or annoying.Even the tv volume indicator is well thought out; the readout bar appears vertically on the left side of the screen (which does not block subtitles or sports programming with bottom scrolling tickers) and displays just long enough to view the output yet disappears quickly as to not disturb program viewing.As for the negatives, there where only two to speak of...The first being an auto volume leveling feature which reduces those high volume commercials as compared to main programming. This was a feature I was very glad to see included in this set, yet ultimately was disappointing because I could not tell the difference when this feature was turned on or off.The second negative is a doozy though. Unfortunately, my set died after 6 days of use. The set shut itself off, and would not come back to life.Hopefully, this is just a lemon that fizzed out, and not a reflection of the quality of the product.If this hdtv worked without incident for 5 years, I would give it a five star review. But for now, as it stands, I am skeptical that the replacement of this unit will live through it's one year warranty.

The website claims there are (2) USB ports in reality there is only (1). Website claims that there are (2) component video inputs in reality there is only (1).

However, after about a month of viewing a greenish hue began at the bottom left of the screen (took up maybe 8 square inches, 4 inches across x 2 inches high).  Eventually, this grew upwards to the top 3/4 of the tv.  Here's where the nightmare began.  I called Samsungs customer service (I am still under warranty but past the return policy of where I bought it) and they issued a repair ticket in which I was told I would be contacted by a repair service within 48 hours.  2 weeks later, I get a call from a repair man asking to schedule an appointment.  The repairman replaced the panel and the main board 1.5 weeks after his call, but to no avail.  He told me to wait a couple weeks to see if it improves.  It didn't.  I called Samsung back and requested a replacement but they said they won't replace it and could only send out another repairman.  So, I requested another repairman to fix it, but received an e-mail that there was no one in the area that could fix it and to call Samsung back to request a replacement (I'm quite frustrated at this point).  I call them back and the FINALLY acknowledge my replacement request and said I would get a credit at the store where I originally purchased it (I'll comment on this if this doesn't go smoothly).This is the biggest headache I've ever had to deal with regarding customer service.  I know Samsung has it in them to make good products, but now I'll never know.  This is the last Samsung product I will buy.  I will stick to LG/Panasonic for my technology/appliance needs.Pros:  +Good picture while it lasted  +Menus are intuitive and easy to use  +Burn in protection is nice  +Remote is straightforwardCons:  -Picture degraded and developed greenish hue  -Bad Sound (pretty typical with this type of TV)  -Image Retention.

Upgraded from a Sanyo 42\" 1080p LCD that we have used since 2008. Was unsure about the Plasma because of all the \"Screen Burn\" issues. Not really a big deal, just have pay a bit more attention to what your doing than you would w/ an LCD. I ONLY watch television and movies on this TV. No video games. After watching a movie (and believe me, we watch TONS) there is a bit of the black bars retained on the top and bottom of the screen, but simply switching to TV and letting it play on a channel w/ no reception (SNOW) for about three minutes cleans the retention right up. Watched four football games on it last weekend and never worried about the stat bars causing any burn in as the commercials were more than enough of a change to protect the screen. No big deal. What you gain with this Plasma is an INCREDIBLE picture. Makes my LCD look terrible by comparison. The picture is WAAAAYYY sharper. The blacks are really black. My LCD the blacks were always kinda grey. Not something I ever really noticed until I got this television. Noticed the reviews here and from B*st B*y prior to my purchase. But also noticed on the other stores reviews that prior to October the reviews for this TV were terrible. After October 2011 the reviews were almost all 5 stars. I am in the automotive repair business myself and it seems to me that Samsung had a bad run on power supplies and relays on the sets built sold in the months prior to last October (2011). I see the same thing in cars. Bad parts in the supply chain. But, that being said, I love mine. Sad to say, but with the economy being as bad as it is, we stay home and watch a lot of  movies.

Yesterday on 12/27/11 while watching TV the screen suddenly just went off. Tried turning it on but no picture only audio. Looked closer and discovered under the front glass there were two internal spider cracks on the screen. There is no external damage. I've read up on this and seems like a common issue Samsung tries to side step responsibility time after time again. I've taken VIDEO of the TV which PROVES that there is no external damage and a TECH is supposed to come by sometime to verify but from reading other posts seems like the techs side with SAMSUNG. Maybe its from how hot the screens get, gasses, who knows but it wasn't due to mishandling by myself or anyone else. I've been a loyal customer with Samsung TV's for years and this is my first ever issue which I hope SAMSUNG will stand up and do the right thing as a Multimillion dollar thriving company should for their paying customers when it's obviously a manufacturing issue and a common one and they know it happens. For some reason I cant post the link to my youtube video but I will happily send to a SAMSUNG CS head. If SAMSUNG still denies from the video and technician I'd like to have head from SAMSUNG come to my house and PROVE it is not a internal issue. One of the worst things is when you pay hard earned full price money for a product and get something inferior in return and basically told by that company Tough Luck or word is everything and your word means crap even if you have HARD proof. I just want it fixed or replaced with a friendly smile.************UPDATE  1/4/12So SAMSUNG is trying to deny that the cause is internal and that I caused the cracks in the TV..But yet they offer to pay for replacement parts as long as I pay for labor which is a few hundred bucks. Clearly SAMSUNG knows that the problem is internal then why even offer to pay for replacement parts. I refuse to have to pay another dime especially for labor on a product that is only 4 months old and still under warranty. I even offered to ship the TV for SAMSUNG to look at and they refused. They never sent a tech in person to look at anything. One of the head CS said that the TV's are actually designed not to show damage on the screen externally and its very possible it was caused by physical mishandling where the internal screen would be damage. Are these guys kidding me what kind of sense does that make. So you design a TV Screen so the external screen is protected but does not protect the screen inetrnally. That's about the dumbest logic ever. Thats like buying a car and u get in a accident where the car's exterior is 100% fine but yet the inside of the car is all kinds of messed up. This is proof along with the HUNDREDS of other same complaints that SAMSUNG who I once considered a FLAGSHIP company operates their customer service like a FLY BY NIGHT paper bag operated corporation. Not only will I be contacting the BETTER BUSINESS BUERAU (which by the way everyone who has this same issue should do) I guess they didn't realize from my email I sent them after they wanted pictures that I work for a WORLD WIDE Major TV network so this will be going around. I will mobilize a class action suit. EVERYONE WHO HAS THIS ISSUE contact me ASAP to build the suit.

It broke right after 3 yr warranty expired :(. I called Samsung for customer service. Point blank - they wanted to charge me almost 200 bucks just to come to my house +parts and labor. I contacted local repairman too. They were a few bucks cheaper but I began contemplating a charge of almost 500 bucks. That didnt sound right since a new TV these days is for 1000 bucks.So, I took matter in my own hands. I am not savvy and would rate myself 30 to 40 out of 100 in electronics. I am 70 to 80 out of 100 in computers so this confidence helped me open the rear end of my TV. Trust me, it wasnt easy. Screws were (I think) intentionally hidden to give you tough time if you chose to DYI. I opened it in about 2 hrs and found about 5 fuzes in the rear end. Left my TV open and went to Radioshack to buy that fuze. Radioshack didnt carry that fuze. Finally landed up ordering the fuzes online - total damage with shipping?.. hold your breadth.. $10. All the while (about a week), My TV laid open on the floor of my basement. (So, dont try this if you are in an apartment with limited space and have kids in the house).I replaced the fuze and wallah.. TV worked.

I wanted the bigger screen and 1080p capability. Fair warning, this is a TV only. You won't be able to access the internet w/ it to watch YouTube or stream Netflix directly, but since most of your peripherals probably have those features already, you probably aren't missing out on anything.As other reviewers have pointed out, there are very few inputs, which can be a little annoying, but not a huge deal if you don't have an excessive amount of peripherals attached.One thing I will say about the TV is that it does not produce what's known as \"The Soap Opera Effect\" onto the picture that you see with most HDTV's these days, where everything looks like it was shot on an ultra-HD camcorder. Whether you think that's a good thing or not, really depends on your taste as a viewer. Personally, I'm not a fan of it. To me, those images look, for lack of a better term, \"too real\". The picture on the TV is crisp and clean, and the colors look great, but it won't fool anybody if you were to play one of those HD aquarium or fireplace scenes on it.As far as sound goes, I couldn't tell you, since it was immediately hooked up to my surround sound system and i don't think I've ever used the TV's internal speakers. But, I can't imagine it would sound great, since they've probably sacrificed speaker quality for screen size and to keep a thin profile.I can't speak for these other reviewers who've had problems with theirs, but I've been logging quite a bit of time on mine since November and haven't had any issues. Knock on wood.Overall it's a good TV for the value, but does not have all the bells and whistles that higher price TV's of this size do.

I think I got it for just over $600 right here on Amazon. So far it's been nice and has worked well. I keep reading these terrible reviews (so many of them) so I decided to get an extended 4-year warranty for $100. Be that as it may. As I said so far the TV has worked fine, picture is awesome, sound is good.There is one little issue that I've found so far in regards to the screen. When I watch recorded material off of my DVR, I notice a single white line at the very top of the screen. The line is horizontal and runs the length of the television. It doesn't bother me much since it's at the very very top, I mean any further up and it would be off the screen. I notice also that it happens only on material recorded on non-HD channels so maybe it's a picture size issue?The other thing that has now really bothered me is the minimal amount of inputs that the TV has:2 HDMI1 USB1 Component INput (RCA) - yes, only 1.1 Digital audio output (optical) TOSLINKAnd one that looks to be a mini-headphone type jack, but it is called \"SERVICE.\"THAT IS IT. No other outputs.I normally wouldn't have an issue since I only need the 2 HDMI for my DirecTV and BlueRay player, and the component cables for my Wii. But recently I bought some Sennheiser wireless headphones and had no way to hook them up. I tried everything I could imagine without having to buy more equipment but was unable to hook them up directly to the TV.The component (RCA) cables are \"input\" so no sound going out. The TOSLINK jack is really odd-looking and Sennheiser told me I would need some adapter for it. And what Samsung claims is a mini-heaphone jack (that in reality is called \"service\") doesn't really work, or at least I get no sound out of it if I hook up my headphones to it. I had to hook them up directly to my DirecTV box (since that has a lot of input/output choices).I really don't understand why such a new TV would have such limited amount of input/output options.

During my research i found a lot of information that nobody seems to mention. Break in procedure for a plasma of 100-200 hrs and how calibration plays a role into the image retention issues. After setting my tv up i let it run a break-in cd which flashes diffrent colored images on loop. If we weren't watching the tv and we were up the unit would be running the cd. Calibrated the unit after a few days of this procedure. I have watch movies on widescreen and fell asleep accidently with a menu on. No harm done. The only time a image was retained was during the first couple days in a long video game session in which there was a white symbol on the screen for a long period of time. The white symbol was barely visible when the screen was black. Used the white sliding bars to reset the screen and all is well again.

I should have re-read those reviews before I bought. That's exactly what happened to my set. It worked just fine for 10 months. The picture was excellent with deep blacks, white whites and great contrast. The sound was pretty good too for built in speakers. In the tenth month of service, we were all gather round watching a movie when we began to notice a flickering in the bright parts of the picture which was coming from my cable TV provider. I thought it might be something on their end that would eventually stop. A few minutes later we switched to Netflix and the problem followed. About 15 minutes after we noticed the flashing, the TV just died, shutting itself off. When I powered it up I could here a clicking noise but no picture. After several clicks there would be silence. I tried unplugging the unit and reconnecting. All this did was produce the same clicking but no picture. Since the set was still under the 1 year warranty, I called Samsung service. It took a week for a technician to show up. He brought two circuit boards which he installed. Then the moment of truth....he plugged in the TV and I heard the musical sound it makes just before there is a picture. I was elated but for naught. Almost immediately, the TV powered off on its own. The technician just sat there shaking his head. He told me that he would have to replace the plasma screen but it had to be ordered since he didn't have one on his truck. That was 2 1/2 weeks ago and still the parts have not arrived. I called Samsung to ask about replacing the set since it's still under warranty but they pretty much squashed that idea saying that the plasma screen would fix the problem. From what I've read in the reviews, this is a common problem. Therefore, it is my recommendation that you don't buy this model TV. I certainly will never buy another Samsung product.

Cons: as with all plasmas, it's a little hard to see in bright light, but the TV has a three picture mode to change to for best viewing. Speakers are weak, but this is normal for all flat screens.

It is originally $1,000 but the model is about 1 year old.  There is no reason to trust these other \"Reviews\" through Amazon.  Everybody is complaining about a broken remote or limited capability, and nothing to do with the stated performance.  Well they should have done their homework.  This is a basic 51\" Plasma TV.  Plasmas do have a glossy cover and this is why it is better to have them in non-direct light areas, it is not the TV's fault that buyers don't do their homework.  Another brilliant reciew was that \"all Samsungs\" are junk and don't buy them, actually they are rated the #2 recommended Plasma and #1 LED for the past 3 years.Either way, do your own homework.  Don't read these garbage, lazy reviews of people who were too lazy to go to the store and actually see the TV's.  This TV is AWESOME.  It has limited capabilities, but if you have a stereo you run your TV cable, DVD, and Music out of you are all set.  New TV's are not supposed to have big speakers like the old tube TV's, they are supposed to provide a picture with adequate sound, thats it.I would recommend this Samsung Plasma TV to my mother.  If you do your homework, you realize this is an AWESOME deal and for $650+ a TV stand you have a great set up for $750.

I was a fan of Samsung displays and electronics, having nothing but good experiences first with a PC monitor, which is 9-10 years old, and my 32\" 720p LCD TV, going on 6-7 years in age. I expected similar performance and longevity out of this TV. The performance was there. The longevity wasn't.After performing dutifully since late 2011, about a month ago I come home and turn the TV on, and it refuses to start. I seem to recall paying in the 700ish range for this. A 700 dollar appliance should last longer than 20 months.Apparently Samsung has had quality control problems with parts and capacitors since 2008, and indeed they copped to it in some of their earlier models (after a class action lawsuit). Unfortunately, this particular TV was not included in that lawsuit, and Samsung won't do crap. Obviously they're skimping on customer service as well as quality control. (Which makes me wonder where the profits ARE going... oh, right, CEO pockets.)Now I'm left trying to fix this 700 dollar 51\" paperweight. I think I've narrowed the source of the problem down to the X Main board, although all the capacitors there look good, and I don't feel like buying a soldering iron or a multimeter, so I think I'll just replace the whole board with parts from eBay and hope that brings it back. If you're saying to yourself, \"X Main huh? Capacitor who? Multimeter what now?\" Don't worry! So was I, a month ago.
