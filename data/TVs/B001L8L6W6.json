I have a media center with xbmc and aeon and the picture is fantastic. The picture and colors are almost perfect straight out of the box. I will be tweaking the setting down the road though. The only thing I am not totally satisfied with is the sound. The speakers do seem to be a bit weak.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "46\" Great screen for price.", "Author": "JRod", "ReviewID": "R2SSE7X5OY3GI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Setup easy.

I do plan on adding a sound system in the future for movies, games and such. Totally a \"cinch\" to use right out of the box. Great set up; on screen menu and good picture (even w/o HDTV as yet) !!!  The only TV I'll give 5 stars to; will be LED, and hasn't really been perfected yet; nor has the price been \"obtainable\" for most. I'd give this one 4.5 stars if I could though; am VERY SATISFIED !!!  You could definitely do worse; especially for the money.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "SAMSUNG TV WILL DIE AFTER THE WARRANTY GETS OVER", "Author": "Do not sell Fake \"Fake Rolex results jail time\"", "ReviewID": "R3O2GRQP0RF42O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY ANY OF SAMSUNG TV.
