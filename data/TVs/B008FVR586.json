{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Why buy a Samsung for $200 more?  FANTASTIC DEAL!", "Author": "R.

I had a 39\" Samsung already, and honestly in terms of picture quality I don't notice a difference at all.  The panel is great, no issues whatsoever, tons of adjustment from the pretty-straight forward menu interface.  The remote is simple, light, and works great.  The case looks a little cheap with some visible sink marks from the injection molding process, but honestly I'm not looking at that when I'm using it, are you?  The sound quality is definitely sub-par compared to the Samsung, so be sure to hook it up to a decent stereo.  I'm really happy with it, I'll update this review if I find anything else to mention.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "39\" screen measured diagonally from corner to corner For optimal viewing in medium-size rooms.\n100,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio (5000:1 native) For an arresting viewing experience\n1080p display Provides the highest quality progressive-scan picture possible from a high-definition source\n3 HDMI inputs HDMI cable not included.
