Colors are great and Blacks are very black. Shipping company was slightly frustrating (Seko Logistics), I had to drive 70 miles to Indianapolis because they could only deliver during the times when I was working. I didn't include shipping in the rating because it doesn't have anything to do with TV performance. Loses one star for poor speaker quality (buzzes on high pitched sounds) and lack of optical output. Overall worth the price. Will update after 6 months.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE! LOVE!
