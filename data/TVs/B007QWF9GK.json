It is a good TV for the kitchen.Vizio has a great picture and good stand alone sound if you do not intend to hook this TV to a sound system/bar. I have a 46\" Samsung and while the picture is great, the sound is very disappointing, unusable without hooking it up to a home audio system. I have a 42\" Vizio and it sounds fine.This TV is 720p/1080i (not 1080p) but you cannot tell at this size. This picture is great, very crisp, clear and vivid.When we bought it right out of the box we thought it had a speaker problem. We had to turn the balance all the way to the left. We asked for a return and as we liked the TV picture so much we asked for another (by the way Amazon gave us 30 days to return while shipping the new TV in 2 days). The second TV also had the same speaker issue or so we thought. After moving it to the bedroom, it did not have a speaker issue. After changing cords and eliminating causes we found it to be a problem with the Directv device. Reset the Directv box and the speaker issue was gone on both TV's.Now we loved the TV's so much, we cancelled the return and paid for the second one.Warning: E191va comes with only 1 (one) HDMI port, if you need two you want the E190VA.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV", "Author": "A.

Vizio:  The case design is great for fitting between upper and lower cabinets in the kitchen.2. Vizio:  The menu design is excellent, better than Samsung . . easy to find and operate all settings.3. Samsung: Better built-in speakers plus Analog and Digital audio output . .  missing on Vizio.4. Samsung: Slightly better picture quality, but not as important as other differences.Vizio . . The picture quality is great.  The on-screen menus are easier to use than most.  We tried it with a \"plain old analog signal\" modulated from our Dish Satellite receiver for secondary TV's.  With the TV in ZOOM mode, the picture filled the screen with almost no cropping and no noticable stretching . . and the overall picture quality was good for a plain old analog TV signal.I am only down-rating this TV because of the fairly-poor audio quality.  You may think the audio is OK if you don't do side-by-side comparison to other similar TVs.  We are not looking for high fidelity of course, but the audio has a hollow resonance that makes speech less clear than it should be. Pickup your coffee cup and talk straight into it. Its not really as bad has talking into your coffee cup, but the speaker installation was not designed to dampen backside resonance from inside the case.We watched a 1 hour drama last night where the audio production was good, but parts of the dialog were a little hard to understand because of the speakers.  Bummer.  Even newscasts are a little muddy where microphones are ideally positioned on the TV personalities.Its ironic the TV has all sorts of audio enhancements in its Menu and then fails to pay better attention to  speaker performance.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very High Value", "Author": "S.

It is very easy to transport so I will bring it into the living room as well. Picks up many of my OTA local channels using just a paper clip. Comes in high definition with great sound as well.Speaking of sound, this TV is loud. Which is a good thing because I did not want to purchase extra speakers or a sound bar.One feature I enjoy is the back button. Not only does it work between channels, but also between inputs. Therefore I can watch the Roku and easily switch to live TV and back again.For the cost of this TV, I am very very happy. It does everything that I wanted it to do, takes up little space, has loud volume, clear picture, and very efficient power consumption (also has an auto-off timer). As a bonus: TV remains very cool to the touch even after hours of use. No extra heat equals no wasted energy.The only thing lacking is a longer power cord.

I've had it now for just a little over a month and thought I would update. The only issue I have is the delay when turning on the TV or changing channels.  When I turn the TV on there's about an 8 second delay before sound or picture appear, enough time to make one think the \"on\" button didn't work and you tend to press it again (turning it off).  Changing channels is not much better with a 4-5 second delay.  Once I adjusted myself to that annoyance (the TV won't certainly adjust to me), I appreciate the good quality sound and picture...and the price.I read the comments about poor sound quality but decided to get it anyway.  I use it in a small craft room and the sound quality is just fine.  Perhaps this TV is suited for smaller areas.

On my first one the vertical viewing angle was extremely limited.  The screen would darken if you viewed it from slightly above or slightly below direct on as would happen if one stands up or sits down.  The current model is much improved.B. On the remote there is now a short cut for changing channels, a big improvement over scrolling up and down or direct entry of channel numbers.Negatives:A big reversal is the elimination of the next listed program on a channel's schedule. Previously, the \"info\" button on the remote would show you what is currently being shown along with a short description of the program plus the same information for the next scheduled program.  The TV I just purchased just gives you the current program but no description.  There is no information concerning the next scheduled program.

The actual image size (top to bottom) is just slightly bigger than a conventional 13 inch tube TV but the footprint is a lot smaller.  The VIZIO is very compact and lightweight.  The speakers are in the front and the screen angles up slightly.  The remote is simple and intuitive.  The screen has a nice flat finish which eliminates glare and room reflections.Here's the tricky part - it requires a lot of tweaking to get a perfect picture and sound but once you spend the time, you're set.  There are lots of adjustments you can make which is a very good thing for techies like me.  I bought a refurbished unit for $110 and am well-satisfied, so far.  My concern is that Vizio does not have a good track record for reliability being on a par with Coby so who knows how long it will last.  After 3 days, it looks and sounds great.  I'm running the BASS setting at full - otherwise the audio is very thin.The TV also has a PC input, USB connection and analog audio out.The major manufacturers have chosen NOT to build smaller sets so if that's what you need and want, you're forced to look to second-tier makers for a small TV.  In fact, Vizio no longer has any 19 inch sets on their website so I assume this model has been discontinued.

We purchased it for our kitchen and are delighted with every aspect of it. For those who complain about the sound quality, please keep in mind that this isn't a huge TV designed to deliver premium sound. It's a TV to be used in small places. With that said, the sound is perfectly clear to me, and the picture couldn't be any better. In order to view the picture at its best, you should place the TV at close to eye level. If you view the picture while standing in the kitchen and the TV is about 3 feet lower than eye level, you'll notice some drop off in color saturation. I suspect this would be the case with any TV. When viewed straight on, or slightly off from straight on, the picture is as rich and brilliant as I've seen on any TV, regardless of size. We use this TV a lot while watching the evening news during dinner. The TV is located on a stand at the far end of the kitchen table, so we're viewing it straight on, from about 5-6 feet away. I have to say that the picture is absolutely perfect, providing crystal clear and fully saturated images. The sound is equally clear and is as good as you'll get in a small TV. We do have this TV connected to an HD cable box, so that contributes to the fabulous picture that we receive. The bottom line is that this TV is exceptional in every way.

The one I bought is the E221VA.To address a couple things I read in the reviews...Sound- Of course, if you have been listening to an old CRT TV with a big speaker, this one will not be anywhere near that size, and although they make higher quality speakers in small sizes, they are expensive, so for what I paid for this, the speakers are as good as I would expect.  They are very adjustable as well with the on screen menu, and there are two of them, stereo, I can see them through the small grill, they are oval shaped and about 3.5 inches by 1.5 inches.  Frankly, sound is compromised for aesthetics, larger speakers would mean having a place to put them.  As it is, they are partially obscured as well by the grill and screen frame, so the space for the speaker at the bottom is even smaller than the speaker itself.  But as I said, it is as good as expected, and sitting fairly close to a TV of this size, within six feet, it isn't something that is bothersome.  I do notice when I get further away from it without raising the volume, it does sound tinny compared to the old CRT TV I had before.Adjusting the Color- The color is adjustable, what might be confusing to some is there are six or seven presets to choose from, one of them says custom.  On custom you can change all the usual things.  I suggest downloading the manual before buying anything like this, which is what I did.  What I did was choose the custom setting which I thought looked best, then when you move to custom, it starts at the preset settings, so you can adjust it.  Frankly, on HD, it looked great right out of the box, it is when on a 480-line signal that the adjustment becomes an issue.Overall, quite happy with this, it was about $20 more than a computer monitor of this size, but has a TV tuner included.The only thing that cries for improvement, in my opinion, is the remote, no light and very tiny lettering on the buttons, but only because I have had better ones, not a big issue once you memorize the oft used buttons.  But thin and black, so will try to escape to the couch cushions whenever it gets the chance.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "another great Visio product", "Author": "Jeff M. \"advertising\"", "ReviewID": "R14P6QH6G83NCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have 5 Visio TV's ranging from this 22\" to our larger 49\".

It's NOT EVEN WORTH $78! It's a POS, pure and simple. The WORST looking display, and the WORST sound, I've ever encountered. NOT BUY ONE!!!I read most of the reviews on the TV set. Some people said the speakers were poor, while other people said they were OK. I expected that the speakers would be average or at least tolerable. I was wrong: they are awful. Cheap low bid Chinese garbage, would be my bet, for ALL the components.They sound like you are listening to a 1960's 9 volt battery operated transistor radio, that is inside a large, deep, narrow metal can; well two of them. These speakers are just UNBELIEVABLY BAD. And, there is no redemption from the so called 'equalizer'. I spent 45 minutes, trying to get something resembling decent sound out of the POS speakers. I just couldn't 'adjust' the sound to anything I would actually want to listen to. The sound booms, if you turn it up, and it sounds hollow. It's hard to understand the dialogue, it sounds muddy. The speakers are just plain garbage, and they sound horrible.And the picture. How did Vizio manage to make a picture SO UNBELIEVABLY BAD? Low bid Chinese slave labor LCD display? I spent more then TWO HOURS trying to get flesh tones to look like something other than a dead zombie, while trying to retain reasonably decent background colors. It is simply impossible. You want reds to be red, greens to be green, blues to be blue, flesh tones to look real, and yellows to be yellow? Well, you won't get it from this POC TV set. Pick **TWO** out of the FIVE, and you MIGHT GET THEM. Or not.Sometimes, I could only get **ONE** of the FIVE, to look good. And the 'resolution' looks like an old, worn out VHS tape. I kept hoping there was a 'focus' parameter I could adjust. There isn't. The picture is REALLY REALLY BAD. Horrible color, with VERY poor resolution. There is nothing, no redeeming qualities at all. Low price?? Well, you certainly get LESS than what you pay for, no matter HOW cheap it is.Don't waste your money on this. Oh yes: it doesn't even come with an instruction manual, just a 'quick start guide'. Unbelievable. I guess a few pieces of paper, to tell you how to USE the TV, would have cut too much into Visio's profits. What would an instruction manual cost, printed in bulk, in China? Twenty cents per TV set? Thirty cents? Wow, all that money. Can you imagine some senior citizen TRYING to set up this TV set, with no instruction manual? Yeah: it wouldn't be funny, at all. Buy some other TV. ANY other TV.

Fast forward two weeks later, my roommate figures out that you have to actually press the exit button to back out of the Photo Mode because otherwise the programming still thinks it is in that mode. The set has some sort of build in auto tuner for ambient lighting and the picture flickered so much that I had to turn this feature off. In fact I turned all of these features off and it still flickers (just not as bad). I contacted Vizio because I bought it directly from them and they would not help me via email. They said that I had to call customer service. Well yeah right. From the horror stories I have read online, no thanks.
