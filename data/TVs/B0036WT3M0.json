BUT - steady buzz from back of set.  Not very loud, but clearly shouldn't be there.  When sitting in front of the TV with it turned on, you really can't notice. But if you turn volume down, or mute, it is clearly noticable. Called customer service - and she was clearly someone with barebones training. Most questions I asked her, she put me on hold and obviously checked with someone else.  Anyway, bottom line is she came back to the phone and told me that 'that's normal; that's the way the set sounds'.  I voiced my concern about this answer, but clearly was not going to get any further on this phonecall. Hung up. To be sure I wasn't being too picky, I had my wife and a brother come into den, where this TV is, and they both agreed that this was, in fact, NOT normal - at all!  Called Samsung back, gave them history, and told the guy NOT to tell me this was 'normal'.  He didn't. Instead he dispatched local repair shop. Several days later service guy arrived, and took set apart.  He figured out which module was buzzing, and ordered one.  Two weeks later he returned with an entire front panel of the TV. This includes new screen, frame, most of the guts (including buzzing component), less one board, and power supply. Samsung told him to order it that way, not just the \"failing\" component (?)  Almost a new TV entirely! He put it all together, and guess what?  The noise was still there, but now louder than ever!  That was a few days ago, and here I sit with my now louder buzzing TV, that I can now hear, sitting in front of set with normal volume on.  And Samsung says this is Normal !!  Grrrrrrrrrr.  The service guy now plans on ordering a new power supply, and replacing that.  If that doesn't work, he thinks a new set entirely is in order!  Except for 1 board where all the jack connectors are, the metal back panel, and the pedestal, isn't that what I already have?? !

The first TV had a loud buzzing sound emanating from the rear.  Other reviewers have noted this and it was noticeable at normal listening levels.

It dont have a WIDE viewing angle for side viewing. Though you still see the picture...it has much less of its Contrast at a angle..bought for my parents and only reason TV was not the best choice for them was they view it mostly from  angle in thier chairs. but it does Swivel nicely if you do disire to sway it your way for the peak picture and very solid glass base. Again...If you are someone who has most of your viewing for this TV to be from a ANGLE when seated...best to chose those that advertise a WIDER optimum viewing degree angle..like those who say something like a 176 degree angle of viewing...My Vizio does have a better viewing angle not losing its peak picture quality nearly as quick as you angle your view.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "R.

When I called customer support I KNEW MORE THAN THEY DID AND I KNEW NOTHING!!  I was told that I had to have the TV connected to the Internet in order for it to work.  I said that I have a router.  The TV talks to the router.  The Laptop talks to the router.  Why do they have to go on line for the Laptop to talk to the TV????  I was told (in a condisending way)that is the way it works.  I called several times in hopes that I would finaly get someone that was at least shown the manual for this TV but that was never to happen.  I finally got it all to work properly.  Love the TV.

Their prices have dropped a lot and with the free shipping, they were a bargin. They came in about 5 days from the order date.Both were perfect. Beautiful frame/set astetically, great picture and very good sound.Solid sets.

This one, like my prior one has to be replaced due to the loud buzzing. Its really weak service when these service people that come out usually do not have a clue. Amazon is SO GREAT about everything, that I would NEVER buy online without having them involved if at all possible. BUT samsuck on the other hand has the Absolute WORST customer service of any well know company I have ever had to endure. Besides the Tv issues, I had the BlueRay player that cost $400 that they had in their so-called service center back and forth 10 times, half the time they didnt even do a thing to it they just sent it back ( As admitted by the gibronie I got on the phone for THOSE conversations), and when they DID do \"service\" on it, it only got WORSE every time, until it started coming back with physical damage to it. I have tried to contact management, and they now do not respond to me at all. I am left with a beat up/damaged $400 worthless blueray player and a loud buzzing tv. The previous tv with the same buzz was a 37\" 720P model. I am amazed how samsuck is still in business after all the thousands of serious customer service ( Or LACK of) that I have read about on-line. They have many products with fatal flaws that they just ignore until the customer gets exhausted and gives up, so it seems. Then these same ADHD sufferers go out and but another samsuck product?! Hello McFly!? What needs to be done is a huge class action lawsuit to put them back in perspective of proper respect for us the consumers who for some unknown reason to me, are keeping them as one of the few companies actually gaining in this economy. I will NEVER spend money on anything samsuck ever again, that is my guarantee, no matter what the reviews are, their customer service will jerk you around and screw you over in the end, and THAT my friends is NOT acceptable treatment of American consumers AT ALL, but they are getting away with it!", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN37C550 37-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LCD HDTV", "Author": "R.
