It is nice for the bedroom, and casual watching. 2 HDMI hookups, cable and a USB port.When you first turn it on, it will play a little tune, and it will go through the plug and play setup.If you connect it directly to the cable outlet without going through a cable box, you can get all your basic cable channels plus any over the air HD channels, which is quite nice, cause some cable companies do not carry all of the optional over the air HD channels that are now available.A very very thin model, and a price you cant beat!", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Review", "Author": "MANOFKRYPTON", "ReviewID": "R2SB9O5O5J59R4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently bought this Television, and thought I would give my thoughts.Pros:1.

I shopped around and would constantly find myself right back to this TV. After asking a few friends and store sales people, about 75% recommended Samsung and thought this was the best price for the size. I have to admit I used to only buy LG and Sony products but their price for tv's is crazy high. Considering I don't have any experience with flat screen tv's or Samsung, I love this one. So far so good and worth putting up with the crowd on Black Friday.I installed it myself and it is so easy.

No bells and whistles. Took exactly 10 mins to setup. Watched few hd channels and the quality was mind blowing.

But, if you plan on using as a monitor for your computer, it cant be done unless you have a newer digital computer. There is no analog connection on the set. The tv tells you that if you want to use as a computer monitor to use HDMI port 1. They dont tell you it cant work with regular laptops or pcs. Also there is no audio input even if you have digital computer. If you add the cost of upgrading to digital converter or new video card for your computer, not a bargain.

The reason for that is there are only two HDMI ports.  However, that aside, this tv is wonderful.  It has an internal tuner (so you can pick up local HD channels, which look amazing) and one thing that really impressed me is how black the blacks are.  Not weak black levels on this tv, but very inky dark blacks.  Excellent!  Also, for the price and the brand, this is a killer set!

Had my son give me some pointers on what to look for and what to avoid.  I had also heard horror stories about how difficult it is to hook up some of the new tv's.  I ordered this tv on-line on Thanksgiving (instead of standing in line on black Friday) and it was at my house by Monday!  It took me a total of 10 minutes to get it in place and all hooked up -- VERY EASY!  The picture has been great and the sound is fine although I do have to agree that it isn't movie theater quality.  So, when we watch movies we just hook up the stereo to the tv - problem solved.  My only other complaint might be that there is no light behind the manual buttons on the bottom of the screen. So if you can't find the remote and have to use the buttons it is very difficult to tell what and where to press.  All in all this tv has been great so far and I would recommend it.Update -- we have had this tv now for almost 2 years.  Still love it. It has performed well and we have had no problems with it.  However I still don't like that you can't see the little \"button\" areas on the screen to manually change channel,volume, etc..", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Our first flat screen", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R30V6JNA0Q1F5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We looked for a while for the best value for our first flat screen TV.
