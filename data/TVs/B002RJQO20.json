For a 720p HDTV, going head to head for picture quality, you had to spend $100 more to get something which smoked its picture quality. The colors are rich; motion tracking is OK.Verizon FiOS looks great on it when fed via HDMI. DVD's & Blu-Ray look great on it too for casual, non-critical viewing.The speakers are decent and have a balanced sound. The surround sound emulation option sounds like crap. It literally makes the whole TV enclosure sympathetically vibrate like a cheap clock radio.The only other con is that the remote is not a universal remote so it cannot be programmed to control the Verizon set top box nor an Insignia BluRay player. Is it too much to ask that all remotes have the capability to be universal remotes?Otherwise, given its limitations, it is a great budget HDTV.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "k_jeffords", "ReviewID": "R23ABQOAAOW8BU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive had this TV for almost 3 years now, and its still as great as the day I bought it.

It has been mounted on wall since purchase so it is not related to damage or impact caused by owner.  Do not buy, it is an expensive waste of money to have a 26\" wide screen TV mounted on my living room and having to use a 20+ year old 13\" sitting under it.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "garbage", "Author": "alex", "ReviewID": "R339UE0EMVVW6I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this TV is the worst of the worst, I can tell that's why they had it for bargain price back in 2009 when I bought it. I can definitely say its the worst TV I have ever had in my life. the colors are washed out, and the screen is filled with glare. I think I got blepharitis just from staring at this piece of shit for so long LOL . save yourself the hassle and never glance or even give a look at this TV... its cursed", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor quality", "Author": "Real Ric", "ReviewID": "R2NCGL15O0VC6U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The tuner stopped working after only 2 years, and the picture was never really very good to begin with.

It had all the input and attributes I needed. Overall, this company and product line could dominate the market. Of course, that would be if they had a better history. Perhaps if they were a better TV maker they would not repeatedly overlook simple things that make TV watch enjoyable.If you are like me you will change the volume on your TV constantly. Most of the time it will be because of commercials. Some folks will change volume based on the scene of the show. In either case you will see a huge menu setting style popup each time you adjust volume, right in the middle of the screen. To make matters worse this menu prompt will stay up for an amazing 60 seconds. So imagine you are trying to watch your show and you want the volume up to hear the actors. Expect to see a prompt for 1 minute to pay for you decission.Only a small immature TV company could possibly make such a terrible mistake. Everything else is good about this TV, but that misstep makes this TV unusable without a detecated suround sound system.It also bear mentioning that changing inputs is also not as easy as major brands. You must hunt for it in the menu instead of a simple input press with list style option. That is not as big an issue, but further reenforces the sense that this company has a lot to learn before selling to the mass market.A attached a consumer photo so you can see it before you buy it. Often times I have found at the big box stores they will conveniently not have the remote available for testing volume and input selection features. These are you most common use features, but for this model the remote is always missing in action.

Now it is outdated and will not play new Blu rays . We called Insignia regarding this, and they said tough luck. One manager went as far as you say the customer is always wrong. Please spread the word on this share this with everyone you know. I can't believe a company would be so awful. After 3 years a Blu ray player will not work on new movies anymore . That is ridiculous not to mention it's environmentally harmful to make an electronic that will only last three years ! Please share this with everyone.
