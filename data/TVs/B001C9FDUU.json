It's my first flat panel HD TV. I bought it on the specs, the Philips name and the price.Set up was a snap.  It took longer to get it out of the box than to get it operational. The remote is intuitive.  The on screen menus are simple and straightforward.For me coming from a traditional TV, the picture is outstanding. Colors are rich and lush.  The blacks are black. The detail is amazing.  You can see the pores on news anchors' skin.  The screen is viewable from multiple angles.Speakers are hidden within the unit's case.  Sound quality is excellent.Setting up other devices (DVD player, game console) was simple. It has more connectors than I expect I'll need (at least for now).This unit provides a lot of value.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "price vs. performance", "Author": "N-da-O", "ReviewID": "RCDD87UL15S45", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"I bought this tv a few weeks ago for our kids to use for their viewing. (XBOX 360/ WII, ..etc.) The XBOX 360 graphics when using HDMI are incredible.Sound is good enough. FWIW, the headphone jack is a nice feature for use w/ wireless headphones. i.e. The kids can put on headphones and \"voila!\" peace and quiet.HD channels are very crisp/clear. Standard def is pretty good also. (standard def depends alot on signal strength from your cable provider.)Overall I gave the tv a 5-star rating b/c of the low price and reasonable performance ratio. This is not a high-end Sharp or Sony so I am not considering that in the review. It is however several hundred dollars less that the high end.\"", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best price for great 42\" LCD", "Author": "Fish On", "ReviewID": "R1AVILEZ2MWJUJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price of $750 you will unlikely find a 42\" LCD that has as great quality as this Philips!

So if you continue reading please note this!We've been using this TV since June 2008!  No problems - however, we don't really use the TV speakers so I can't really comment too much on them but before I had the theater system hooked up it sounded fine - one thing from the sound that I really miss was the TV's sound processers ability to mediate the volume transitions from programs to commercials concerning broadcast TV.We have a DVD player, Wii, Roku (Netflix), TV antenna, and a VCR all hooked up via a HiDef Stereo receiver.  The TV works great with everything.We have rearragned our living room such that at times it is desirable to rotate the TV on its base towards the couch and this is done with ease.  I'm using a logitech remote but it was easy enough to use the original TV remote.I saw lots of reviews about this TV with the outcome of a coupon at Costco.  I waited until the very last day of the coupon validity to see if anyone had posted any negative reviews and there were none that were valid enough to me.I highly recommend this product as long as you don't want to mount it on the absolutly flat on wall as the access ports all come straight out the back and therefore you would need to keep the back of the TV at least 2-3 more inches away. You could always cut out the wall there I suppose.  Your choice.As of June 2012, We upgraded to a 47\" LG LED 3D Smart TV Model 47LM6700 and love it!  Gave the Phillips 42\" to Dad for Father's Day to replace their old 27\" box set.  They are very excited!", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV!!!", "Author": "M.
