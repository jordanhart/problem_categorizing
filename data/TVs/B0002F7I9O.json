In fact, many experts (including Consumer Reports) assert that high-definition TVs using traditional cathode-ray tube technology -- as this high-definition Sony does -- currently offer a sharper picture than plasma and LCD TVs, plus they are much less expensive and more reliable. This widescreen HD Sony TV has a very good picture with standard broadcasts and an outstanding picture with HD broadcasts and DVDs.

I have it plugged into my Cablevision service for HD signal - the step up in picture quality compared to standard signal is quite noticeable. But the good thing is that even standard TV transmission (non HD) produces very good picture on this TV (which was a factor in its best buy choice by Consumer Reports). The TV has plenty of video inputs of all kinds, including 2 component video and 1 HDMI.I have my Panasonic S97 DVD player hooked up to this TV via HDMI input and this allows my Panasonic DVD player to upconvert DVD's to 1080i so I can watch them as clear as the HD TV. Granted that the DVD upconvert to 1080i is a Panasonic DVD player feature but you can't use it without having HDMI input on the TV.According to the Consumer Reports review of HD TV's, most HD TV's produce great picture with the HD signal but the picture quality is not so good with standard TV signal. Since most of the programming on TV continues to be transmitted via the standard signal, this TV's very good performance with the standard TV signal was a big factor in my buying decision.", "Date": "March 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "You Can't Go Wrong", "Author": "David in Philly \"DGWT\"", "ReviewID": "R1LTJQE2H72M3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is as fine an HDTV as one can possbly buy at an affordable price.

Be warned that if this is your first HD tv, you will probably need to spend about $150 buying new cables to take advantage of the HD features when you hook up your dvd player and cable box to the tv.  I bought two sets of Monster brand cables for my Comcast DVR cable box and my dvd player.This tv is HEAVY!  My husband and I managed to carry this down steps from our driveway into the house and then down a flight of steps into our basement tv room, but that's only because he's very strong.  You really need at least 2 strong people to carry this.  If you buy locally and can't find help, it would be worth it to pay for delivery and set up.We did have some problems hooking up our cable box to the tv, as Sony's directions are not clear, but we finally got everything working. We have Comcast digital cable and receive a number of HD broadcasts and the picture quality is unbelievable!

I did all the research there is to find out what was the best for the price, reliability and picture quality. I've checked DLP, LCD, Plasma,....CRT is best imo after the plasma. Not that plasma is bad but having to pay $250 for the light bulb every 4000 to 6000 hours! No thanks. And Plasma TV aren't that afortable yet.I'm a movie freak and a gamer. You have a progressive scan DVD player plus the component cables and you are set. Same thing goes for the PS2, Gamecube or Xbox.I'd like to keep on with this review but I have some many movies to watch and games to play again right now! All my DVDs are in widescreen format and I'm finally getting to watch them how they are meant to be watched!Edit: October 19th, 2006After now almost 2 years, I had to get my TV calibrated mostly because of recommendations to get the the best Picture I could get out of this TV. I regret I didn't do this earlier. The picture was great but now it is just plain fantastic. Red push is gone, overscan corrected, picture Sharper than it was, the Black level is phenomenal, I saw details in movie that I never knew they were there. The overall PQ improved. Dvds running at 720p or 1080i are fantastic thanks to the upconversion of my DVD player.The only downside of this set I own is the little bowing on the corners. But we all know that CRT set never had and never will have 100% correct geometry.It doesn't bother me. If you can get it calibrated, do it!

Even though only a few games support THAT resolution, my console games look really good in 480p. There is such a big difference in picture quality...it's astounding. The major reason though is that the next gen consoles will support HD as well, with all games running in at least 720p. Can't wait for that.Cable looks great as well. Channels that are 1080i in widescreen are freaking increadible. Normal channels...so-so. Sometimes they look pretty good, but the picture is a bit on the grainy side.This is a great HDTV. Even though the price is a  bit steep, I think it's well worth it. Remember to buy component cables to watch tv and other devices in high def.

We were not in the HD upgrade market, we just needed a TV since our 27\" Sony Trinitron took on a little lightning.  Being a huge fan of Sony's TVs from years past I was only searching the terms \"Sony TV\".  I didn't even know the Wega was widescreen or HD until I went to the sellers house to see it. He was watching the World Series in HD. He was actually pretty upset that I had money and a truck with me, and he was going to have listen to the rest of the game on the radio.  I think if it weren't for his wife being there I would have left with no TV.I didn't have any HD content to dazzle my wife with at home so I put on a Pixar DVD, Monsters Inc. Even with the signal fed through S-Video, we were both blown away by the improved detail in picture quality. You could actually count Sully's hairs if you were half insane or Rain Man.  But they were all there, all 4,987,653 of them.Since it was HD (1080i), we (my wife) didn't have an excuse to not have a BluRay player anymore, so we (I) decided to get a Sony BluRay to move us into the new era of our life (on the couch).  BluRays look spectacular! We still only get SD from our satellite system, but even that looks fantastic.  This past Christmas (2011) we added an xBox to our family and I'm still blown away by the picture quality.  Baring any more lightning, I expect to have the Wega for many more years.Beast - The Wega weighs slightly less than my house.  I often wonder if the slathering of good reviews of these TVs are written by people (like me) who don't want to come to terms with the fact that someday they will have to move this thing again.  I am holding out hope that when it finally dies, it just turns to dust and we can sweep it up and sprinkle it over the garden and grow some HD vegetables in the next season.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still amazes my friends that it's not a flat panel", "Author": "Corban Dallas", "ReviewID": "R3JZHLVM7MAU2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV about 4 years ago used on Craigslist for $200.  Everyone thought it was stupid and a waste of money to buy a CRT HDTV, but they quickly shut up after seeing the picture quality.  They then thought it would die after a year of use... it hasn't.The picture quality of the set is truly excellent, especially when watching a good Bluray disc.  The speakers are loud and have plenty of bass (something all flat panels lack imo) and I've never noticed any sort of lag, wether playing video games on xbox 360 or watching a high paced movie.  I use my TV a lot, and often leave it on while I'm using my computer for hours, it's still performing excellently.Recently it has started to show some artifacts and \"fuzz\" along the middle lines of the screen, but only when the screen is pure black (I only notice it when it's not receiving a signal).  I'm finally going to upgrade to a Plasma this year, but only because this screen is too small for me, that's literally the only drawback.  I'm keeping this TV as an extra set in another room and if it keeps on being as reliable as it has been, I expect to own it for many years to come!If you find one of these gems for sale on your local craigslist and need a nice HD set for next to nothing, don't hesitate to pick one up!", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awsome affordable high quality HDTV", "Author": "R. Mena", "ReviewID": "R340SDG6HS4JQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all I want to say that Im a filmmaker and know about TV and film quite a lot so I know what Im talking about. Anyone that knows about TV's knows that CRT/picture-tube TV's (the fat ones) will produce superior image quality than any comprable LCD monitor. Just because a TV is thin and flat does not mean that it will produce a better image quality. Thin TV's are all the rage right now but what trully should matter is the picture quality. My Sony 30\" widescreen HDTV's image quality is awsome. I've had it for about a year now and have been very, very, happy with it. Yes, it is super bulky and heavy but it fits in the corner of my bedroom quite well and its picture tube is super flat. Plus, the design of the TV makes it look a lot thinner than it really is. I've had to point out to guests that my TV is not a thin TV. The other cool thing about CRT HDTV monitors are that they cost about 40% less than flat LCD or plasma TV's. And like I said before, LCD will not give the same picture quality as CRT's. Plasma TV's do compare to CRT's but they cost a lot more and unlike CRT's you don't have recharge the chemicals like you do in plasmas after about 3000 hours of viewing time. Plus, I got my TV as a brand new clearance item at Fry's for $600! Trust me, I did a lot of research and this model had it all. About the only thing I wish it had was a third HDMI input and the capacity to broadcast at 1080p.", "Date": "February 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Love Love Love my Sony KV 30", "Author": "Megan Brychcy", "ReviewID": "ROMIDZQKBF493", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Sony a couple months ago through a seller on Amazon.

But in comparison, I only watch my 18 year old 27\" TV a couple of hours a day, and I don't entertain with it on, so dropping $3K on a new set made no sense. I remember seeing the prototype of the Sony widescreen HD CRT sets in Tokyo in 1989, about $15K at the time, and I promised myself I would own one, once the price dropped. And voila! Almost 20 years later, my dream has come true. So can yours, if you can live with the difference in size, picture quality, and energy consumption. Yes, it's quite a bit deeper, but if you are replacing an old CRT, like mine (which died yesterday), you probably won't mind. As you already know, besides the Kuro, no LCD nor plasma is going to give you the detail and contrast (blacks) that a CRT will. And the thing nobody ever talks about is that CRTs will consume much less power than either LCD or plasma. The late model Wegas all come HDMI ready, which is required for all the upgrades coming with digital television broadcast next year, and though this 30\" Sony will not achieve 1080p, it doesn't have to, because that resolution is wasted on any screen smaller than 50\", a fact nobody here seems to acknowledge. I would go so far as to say, if you are not a film maker, you are wasting your time worrying about anything higher than 720p, which this set achieves. Still want to spend $900 at Costco or Best Buy for a comparable plasma? I bought my tv from a gamer who fell hard for his $4K Kuro, and sold his 1 year old Sony to me for...$180! I could have gotten the top of the line 36\"XBR widescreen with matching stand for $450 used, but the point is, if you are looking for a bargain basement HDTV deal, for less than the price of a new Blueray DVD player, now is the time.
