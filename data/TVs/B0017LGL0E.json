Got at BJs, delivered for under $1200. Set up pretty simple. I used the THX Optimizer which is found on most Lucas DVDs such as any Star Wars. So far, Id say the picture is great. Normal cable is what it is, its ok. But I have HD programming and a PS3, which I use for Blue Ray disks. HD looks great! Ive seen so many posts on the net that say 1080 on a TV less that 42 in is not noticable...well, thats BS. I can see a huge difference and the HD and Blue rays look very nice. Also, with 5ms response time, I have no blurring or ghosting when I game, and I play a lot of fast race games.Pros - Great picture and easy to set up.Cons - Only one so far is the remote needs to be aimed right at the TV or it wont work.If a 40 In TV will fit your needs( I have a 800 SF apt, and this TV is a perfect fit), you  cant go wront with this TV.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent initial impression", "Author": "Guillermo Pineda \"Mix-Man\"", "ReviewID": "R1CBEO4A3GHINJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this 1080p/20000:1/5ms/60Hz LCD for a week and my initial experience is extremely satisfactory. It performs as advertised for HDTV, DVD, & PC (haven't tried gaming yet). Works great in a brigth room. No pixelation in fast scenes. Easy access menus. Plenty of inputs for my needs. Looks great.After offers and coupons, my total price at a local B&M; store was $1,356 including the LCD, a sleek Samsung 1080 up-conv. DVD player, a 4-year extended warranty and taxes. Can't complain!Minor cons: Below average sound. Remote control must be carefully aimed at the front of the TV, very narrow angle of operation.Bottom line: If a 40-inch screen size is enough for your viewing needs, this unit holds its own against any other top competitor brands in this category.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN40A530 40-inch 1080p LCD HDTV", "Author": "Desertdaddio \"John\"", "ReviewID": "RXLQGDXYAHVEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung LN40A530 40-Inch 1080p LCD HDTVWhat a bargain.  I went shopping for a Sony and ended up with this great TV.  Everything is there for your needs.  I have no reason to connect my laptop, but it will do that if you want.The picture is stunning.  I compared this to the more expensive models in both Samsung and Sony, and didn't notice much difference.The sound is exceptional, so I don't run it through my system except for some movies.  There are three energy saving modes.  I have mine set at medium at night.  If you have the setting off, it's brilliantly blinding!  You need to have additional lighting on.A great value, great picture (5 ms), and great sound.  The manufactures website hasn't caught up with certain stats, so don't rely on everything you read on there site.Why spend more!", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "V. Geraci", "ReviewID": "R3BJA0A6QP2II4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for a little over 2 months now. The picture quality is fantastic and one advantage of this TV over the LN40A550 I immediately noticed is that the sound is WAY better on this TV. I recommend getting the best picture quality settings from the AVS forum and adjusting the back-lighting to accommodate YOUR rooms lighting. I use Warm 1 setting for blu-ray/DVD movies and normal/standard(with low dynamic contrast on) setting for regular HDTV viewing. PS3 games look great too(game mode)If I needed another television, I would buy another one of these without hesitation.Cons(minor) - I agree with other posts, TV remote has to be pointed directly at the TV to work.Edit - March 2010 and this TV is still great!!", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommend!", "Author": "Good Grace \"GoodGrace\"", "ReviewID": "R24IHVJINQ6BEG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung has done it again! They never cease to amaze me with their clear picture and sharp color that blows the competition out of the water. My husband and I who aren't sports people at all, never knew what we were missing until now. You can see all the details of the playing field. It's easy to set up and run plug and play. It makes as a great decorative piece in your home and can be wall mounted if you pay for a mount seperately or placed on it's stand. We were going to get a 42\" but the price different was drastically different and decided we could live with a couple inches less for a better price. Do not be fooled by plasma, they don't last very long and the bulb burns into the picture. LCD is a little more expensive but it last longer in the long run.

Naturally, as with all products of this type it was obsolete the minute I opened the box, However, \"obsolete\" has become a relative term because the replacement model for this TV is exactly the same. The only change is a letter in the model number. This is done for marketing to make people think they are getting a new and improved product when it really is not.(Now they have the new line of LED slim TVs, but they are way overpriced).I have read and heard many complain about the black levels and motion on LCD TVs, but often times it's merely a matter of adjustments where the black levels are concerned. As for smooth motion the Samsung LN40A530 has no problem with movies or TV shows and the like. (It's only as good as the source after all). If you are a sports enthusiast you may want to go with a 120hz TV if your considering LCD. Although this TV is not terrible by any means, a 120Hz model will give you that edge in smooth motion that is missing from any 60Hz model.As I stated, this TV is a solid performer and very adept at giving the best picture possible from any source and any broadcast form including 1080p which we still have yet to see come over the wire.It even looks good just sitting there when it's off with its black piano like finish. (I don't like the \"touch of color\" models with the red personally so I am glad I chose this model).The only con I can think of is that the controls on the TV itself are impossible to see in any light, so there is no way to control the TV should the remote fail from other than dead batteries.", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent product at very good price", "Author": "Martin", "ReviewID": "RVXQX0824XYAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it at Sears for $900 in December 2008, which was a very good deal, though I see that now Amazon has the 550 at that price and thhis model at $820. The reason I believe its at such a good price is precisely because it is being phased out in favor of newer Samsung models 550, 650, etc instead of this 530. The only advantage some newer ones have are a) 120Hz vs 60 ; b) Dynamic Contrast Ratio (30000:1 or more vs 20000:1 which I don't think is a significant difference, especially considering the price difference).The unit is very nice/ stylish, looks very nice in our living room. Very light, well packed, extremely easy to install. Nice swivel stand can rotate horizontally easily. The image quality when watching HD channels is outstanding. REALLY nice. Don't ever want to see non-HD channels again. When watching DVDs its very nice too. Now, when watching Blu-ray DVD's, its AMAZING, other-worldly. Has really changed our TV watching experience. Be it sports, movies, Discovery-HD, whatever. Much more enjoyable.Down sides: First unit we brought home we had problems with the sound, sometimes it would work sometimes it wouldn't. Exchanged it for an equal model at sears without a problem. I guess you can always get a defective one. The new one works perfectly.The sound from the TV speakers is ok, but who listens through those in any case? Always use the Home-theater system for sound. The watching angle is ok but I think there are better ones. Somebody mentioned that didn't quite know why would they connect their laptop to it: Iconnect it via the HDMI cable to watch Netflix movies straight from their site: te quality is pretty good, though not as good as a DVD.

How awesome is that.  Set up is insanely easy, takes about 5 mins, 8 screws and bam your done.  As of now the picture quality is great but could be better, you gotta go with hd channels, also I recommend changing the factory set. Def change the settings to clear voice and volume auto tune, that will make a dramatic change.

I got this, and she got a 60\" Mitsubishi. At first I was jealous that she had a TV over a foot bigger than mine, but then i saw the difference in picture. We both have Nintendo Wiis, and using the same game her picture quality was much worse. Samusung TVs are the absolute best on the market if you have a tight budget and want the best picture quality available. Samsungs are also the best deal! Of course, the ABSOLUTE best TV is the Pioneer Elite 60\", but it is way to expensive and the Samsung is a not-so-distant second, even as a 40\"!!

I did very little research before buying, (which goes against my usual process) but knew enough of the basics to know that I wasn't getting burned too badly. After hooking this TV up to a blue ray and spending some time in front of it, I can say that most of the reviews here are spot on. There is a little bit of ghosting with the 60 hz. version I own , but other than that (and the fact that the remote does indeed need to be pointed well at the tv) this TV is of superb quality. My neighbors are upset that they spent much more money and aren't as impressed with their picks as they were with this Samsung. I was able to find it for under $800 and it was worth every cent. Some considerations are that it is a smaller HDTV, but if you put it in a bedroom, it will be perfect. Also, it took all of five minutes to set up and the sound is fine as long as the room isn't enormous. I am hard of hearing and there is plenty of audio there!
