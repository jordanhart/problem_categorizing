{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Some initial comments about ordering this TV from Korea", "Author": "Mr. Luigi", "ReviewID": "R1Z7PCY5TDY96M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will follow-up this review with more details concerning its actual performance as a TV/Computer Monitor once I have more time to play with those functionalities.  However, I thought customers considering purchasing this product would appreciate the following information without having to wait.1)  I have bought other products from Amazon from overseas vendors.  Like those, this product came very well packed and in about a week.  It was in excellent condition on arrival from half way across the planet. As good as many items I receive from two states away...maybe better!  The vendor that is supplying this TV to Amazon is to be commended for delivering a product quickly and in good shape.2)  You should know that this is definitely a \"Korean TV.\"  By that, I mean more of the labeling and documentation supplied with the TV is in its native foreign language than some other products you may have bought from overseas.  The manuals are in Korean. They supply no English version.  But, you can get around that by using this link to access a .pdf version of the manual in English (Yes, the URL is really this long!):http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct;=j&q;=&esrc;=s&source;=web&cd;=1&ved;=0CDAQFjAA&url;=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Flgecs.downloadFile.ldwf%3FDOC_ID%3DKROWM000368371%26ORIGINAL_NAME_b1_a1%3DENG.pdf%26FILE_NAME%3DKROWM000368371.pdf%26TC%3DDwnCmd&ei;=GPy1Ud-CMMfH0wHzxoHgDw&usg;=AFQjCNH8dSPqYOGyIBnvJrpsvpSKnOoscA&sig2;=mPpQBCdWIo9ylhsYcqG8BA&bvm;=bv.47534661,d.dmQ3)  What might surprise you is that things like the remote control are also labeled in Korean.  But, the English version of the user manual above provides a picture of the remote that is labeled in English.  So, that is not an insurmountable problem.  Many of the buttons are fairly generic.  You could guess at their use without the manual...but the manual definitely helps.  Other overseas products I have bought from Amazon have been labeled in English when I received them.  So this caught me off guard a bit.  I don't blame LG or Amazon for this however.  The TV was never advertised as anything but LG's Korean version of this TV.4.  Having said the above about the remote being fairly generic and you can get by pretty well without the manual, don't go too far with that advice.  This TV/Monitor is not a simple piece of equipment.  It supports many functionalities, including 3D.  You NEED that manual in English to deliver the capabilities of the unit (assuming you only speak English!)4.  All the cables (power adapter plugs for the US power system) are provided.  Despite the translation issues, LG has provided all the hardware necessary to use this TV in the US with these adaptors.5.  Why did I give it 4 stars and not 5?  Well, as I said, I have not actually put the TV/Monitor through its paces.  I just found that link for the English version of the User Manual and will now work my way through it.  Then I will be in a better position to give it an appropriate rating.  But, right now, I have the unit put together.  All the pieces fit with nice, tight tolerances.  All necessary parts are supplied for the US market.  And it arrived in about a week in very good condition.  That was enough for me to rate it 4 stars for now.I hope this was of some help.Best, Mr. Luigi", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$539.90", "Features": "Shipping from Korea, South. * Delivery time is 4~5 working days *Expedited shipping by FedEX or EMS\n3D glasses included, The most comfortable viewing experience, 2D to 3D converting, Full HD\nThe technology ensures crisp, clear images without flicker and the ability to view images from wide angles.\nMonitor offers a variety of inputs: HDMI, VGA, component input, as well as SCART.\nYou can connect everything from your notebook computer via a game console, to the old VHS video.", "Name": "Original LG CINEMA 3D DM2752D-PN 27\" Full HD TV Monitor LED IPS Panel HDMI + 3D Glasses", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fgF4Nu7SL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009Z8OKR2"}}
