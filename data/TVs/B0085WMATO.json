Sceptre has been in business since 1984 making PC monitors, so it only makes sense they know what they're doing - making a TV is not much different, but with the addition of a TV tuner card among other things. This TV is in a room where it picks up cat litter dust and still no problems.*****The screen is matte as well as the frame around the TV--it looks like matte black brushed aluminum, but it's plastic. The stand is glossy black. The picture quality is very good. The sound is decent if you choose something other than the default setting - one of the settings a graphic equalizer appears, and you have your choice of rock, pop, jazz, and user, where you choose your own settings on the slider bar. Just play with it a bit to find your personal preference.Plus:  Not one dead pixel...I scrutinized it carefully for hours.The 32\" size is perfect for a bedroom; and it has a sleep timer, and it can be set to shut off at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90 and 120 minute intervals.Make sure you peel all the clear plastic off. Five screws in the bottom of the stand and you're finished. The stand doesn't wobble and feels secure enough as long as you don't have kids trying to hang off it. Sceptre also provides a screwdriver and a cleaning cloth.Two tiny complaints: 1. It would have been nice to have a back-lit remote control to see it easier in the dark; 2. The first week I had this, it had a funky plastic odor that I'd notice whenever I entered my bedroom, but I don't smell it now.NOTE:  You cannot use the USB for playing movies off a flash drive, etc.NOTE:  This can also be used as a computer monitor - it has the blue plug-in port for monitor to PC hook-up and the green port for the speaker hook-up. (But I personally didn't try it as a monitor, I only wanted a TV). It's there if you want it.If you're looking for an antenna, this is an excellent one:Paper Thin Leaf Indoor HDTV Antenna - Made in the USA! - Manufacturer Refurbished*****Also, see customer-uploaded images - I took a photo during DWTS showing the picture quality of the TV - and a photo showing the remote control up-close.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awsome TV", "Author": "daniesp7", "ReviewID": "R28XSY8UC1KHK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I never take time to do reviews, but this time they deserve it:Good stuff:- LED (ultrathin)- Modern and cool black shiny design- Good contrast ratio (better than most)- Remote and menus very easy- 3xHDMI, etc...- PRICE!\"Could be better\" stuff:- Its not FULL HD, only 720p.

I didn't think the tv would be great quality and I though there would be many problems. It was delivered on time, in perfect condition. Let me tell you, the TV looks absolutely great. It has a really thin border, and feels well built. The stand was easy to set up, and I got the TV working within 5 minutes. The picture quality honestly is pretty darn good. For a mere $209 32 inch LED tv, you can't ask for a better price than this. The picture quality was great, and sound was good. There were 3 channels that appeared to be signaling issues. Whether that is because of the tv or cable, I don't know. If you are like me, someone who wants a great looking tv, at a good size and amazing price, look no further.

Basic TV features, easy to use, with a shallow learning curve. The only real complaints I have, is that I was led to believe (based on everything I've read about it on the net) that this TV had a glossy piano black bezel. But instead, it is an ugly black wood grain. Also, every spec reference I've seen on the net says that this TV has a 6.5 ms response time. But the intructions that come with it says 8 ms, which is not as good. Might want to consider that if you intend to use it for video gaming. I don't play video games, so it's not that big a deal, but still misleading. I had to buy, and then wait for the TV to get here, to find out that the spec listed all over the net is bogus. Overall, I would probably buy it again, due to the reasonable price. Not likely to ever find a perfect TV for a rock-bottom price. So I am satisfied. But I don't see this TV as a 5 star TV, like most of the other reviews here. Decent for the money?

The picture quality is amazing. If you were to look from the side angles of the TV u can still see the picture quality perfectly without any blur. For the record, i do not understand why people say the sound quality is bad. I think the sound quality is good for a $200 dollar TV. If you expect to get a high end tv with that price range then your expectations are too dam high. I also have a 42inch LCD 1080p TV but i like the picture quality of this LED TV more. The side views like i mentioned before is not blurry and the picture quality is much brighter.As i write this review, i am hooking it up with to laptop. This tv has a better picture quality than my monitor!. Sceptre also specialize in computer monitors as well. No wonder they have such a good picture quality. Before discovering about Sceptre i was thinking of getting an Insignia 32 inch tv but the reviews werent buying it for me. After doing some research on this T.V and reading the other good reviews, i can say that i made a good decision. I needed a TV to play ps3 games and watch movies from my laptop.

We put off purchasing an HDTV until the prices came down to a fixed price point we arbitrarily set years ago when they first came out.Our criteria for a new set: LED rather than LCD, thin profile, multiple inputs, $200 price point, and in the 32 inch size class.This set meets all of our criteria very well.Set was delivered in just 2 days thanks to our Prime membership. Setup was very quick an easy. I had downloaded the user manual ahead of time, and was able to use the information in the manual to cut out and weld up my own custom wall mount for the set. (Think hospital style wall mounting) Just 4 metric machine screws and the set was mounted and up on the wall.At time of order, we also purchased a couple of HDMI cables. A very short cable to plug into a Roku box that was mounted up on the wall with the TV and a long cable to connect our DVD player. Some older equipment is connected via the composite video and audio inputs.After a month of use, here are our observations.What we like:The picture is very sharp and crisp, with no lag at all during fast action scenes, a problem with some LCD sets.The sound is acceptable, with reasonable frequency response.Boot up time is short, and the set turns on to the last channel or input selected.The over the air TV tuner is sensitive and pulls in weak signals with ease. We're quite far from a metro area and still get many channels with our small, outdoor antenna.What we don't like:While the remote is intuitive, and easy to use by touch alone; There's a button sorely missing. Changing inputs can require up to 9 button presses. First you have to press the input button, then scroll down the list of available inputs. Next, after highlighting your choice, you need to press the select button. A single input select button that would cycle through all available would make this television perfect!Conclusion:For the price, this is a wonderful television that we've very pleased with. If we have occasion to purchase another of this size, we'll be buying another one of these.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome cheap LED TV", "Author": "Ch1cken", "ReviewID": "R2T0T6J4Y3EF4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV, especially for the price.  Bought one as a trial since you can't beat the price - how bad could it be? - for a kids room.  After using for a week or so, bought 2 more for the other bedrooms.  Highly recommended!

I think it's about the right size for my RV and it has a pretty good picture connected to my Panasonic BluRay.  I had a Vizio 22\" Razor LED backlit that this one replaced and honestly I think the Vizio picture was a tad better but just too small for my application.  But the Vizio was 1080p and this unit is 720p.  I just watched a bit of Lord of the Rings on this unit and the picture quality is good.  I haven't done any tweaking yet.  I can already see that I want to do some adjusting on the colors but will save that for a camping night activity.  I think the TV is a good buy and worth the few hundred dollar price tag.  Only time will tell if it will last as I'm not familiar with name brand Sceptre but quality seems good.  The unit came nicely packed and even had a little screwdriver to connect the base and had screen cleaning pad.One thing to note.  DO NOT buy the wall mount that is combined with this TV on Amazon's section at the bottom that suggests you buy the mount.  It is the wrong size.  This TV has the wider VESA 400 x 200 size and the mount Amazon is adding to the bottom in the \"add this to your order section\" is only a VESA 200 x 200 size (too small).  I had to return mine and let Amazon know but I think were confused because the mount says it fits up to 37\" TV, but that doesn't matter since the size of that mount does not fit the back of this TV.  Amazon has the right mount for $4 more.  Just make sure it fits VESA 400x200.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "This TV needs MORE Good Reviews!", "Author": "SAMMASH \"HD_MAN\"", "ReviewID": "RQGOGX0TPWA4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already had a great experience with a previous 720 LED Sceptre TV from Walmart.com, so I bought this one which is this year's model from Amazon since it was the best priced 32\" LED 720P TV, and boy is it slim and pretty and colors look wonderful and picture is sharp. I am not concerned about sound althought it is more than good enough for my daughter's room. I had already ran electrical and AV wiring (HDMI/network) between her closet and the wall location where the TV was mounted and had already installed the electrical and AV outlets on both ends. So now, just like in my all other bedrooms I have her new 32\" super SLIM LED TV mounted on the wall with no cables showing, and the display devices are a DirecTV receiver and a networked Sony BD player all hooked up through HDMI runs via the attic and through the walls. The TV looks very impressive and i wouldn't sweat the 720P versus 1080P resolution difference over a 32\" TV, plus it will display an interlaced 1080 solution and it looks wonderful for a $200 TV which looks as good as the $500 ones. Buy with ease and confidence!

Well, it has exceeded my expectations so far. The picture quality is outstanding, on par with Vizio and Samsung products I had considered. There were 0 dead pixels. The two issues most commonly listed as \"cons\" in the reviews I studied were poor sound quality and a finicky remote control. These are non-issues from my perspective. Sound quality is perfectly acceptable if not admirable for such small speakers in such a small enclosure, and the remote works just fine. I bought an RCA cable to connect the audio output to our stereo (anticipating inadequate sound) and never took it out of the package. I'm happy with the native sound from the TV. There are abundant outputs available too, more than other TV's I considered. You can hook this thing up to virtually anything so versatility is great. Don't sweat the 780p vice 1080p limitation either. I'm pretty picky about image quality and I can't tell any difference. Works great with streaming Netflix and old school DVD player too even though they are standard definition. I would have no problem recommending this product. Longevity is the only wild card that I cannot evaluate thus far but the warranty seems pretty good to cover that contingency too. Go for it. It seems its really earned its great reviews.

There must be a catch.\" I read the other reviews, and I did not find any ridiculous \"catches.\" So I swallowed my tongue and ordered the TV. Like I said, I'm a college student, low on cash, so I needed to take a risk with this cheap, no-named company, TV. Boy, was I surprised after I received it. First of all, the TV itself took me a grand total of 3 minutes to set-up with the stand. The TV, while none as thin as many of the other LEDs, is still pretty thin compared to LCDs (which are still pretty much the norm right now). The picture quality, isn't as great as say, a Samsung or a Sony. Obviously, it isn't 1080p, but the slight difference between 720p and 1080p never bothered me anyways. I'm mostly going to use this TV for gaming, and most games only output in 720p as it is. The colors on this TV aren't vibrant. They are subtle and natural, and I prefer it that way. Once again, this TV won't give you the quality you will find in other, much more expensive TVs from top-tier brands. But for $210? It blows away every other TV in that price range. This TV delivers at least double the price it is worth. I highly recommend this TV and I could not be happier with my purchase.As a sidenote, I cannot speak for the longevity of this TV, as I've only had it for a few days. I'm crossing my fingers that this TV will stay intact for the next few years.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tv that beats LG, Toshiba, and Samsung in this price range", "Author": "abelabliss", "ReviewID": "R49M45BJKIQ89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly this tv is perfect for the price. The quality is sharp, vibrant, and has great contrast. Very easy to maneuver around the settings and channels. I got it for $200 so I was extremely happy and agreed with a lot fo the reviews here. i can't stress it enough that everyone should by this Tv for their bedroom and if they're look for something below $350. I don't think the sound is bad at all, I know it could be better but it's definitely not bad. I use it to watch Netflix and play on my Xbox (Halo 4) and both look so sharp and awesome.  There are noticeable grains in the depth of field but you only notice them when your paying attention to them. But there are scenes in shows that have amazing clarity and sharpness. The size is perfect and allows the 720p and 60hz to be perfect for it's size. Its all so balanced. The black frame has a really nice stainless steel look to it. It is a bit wobbly but i know that is fixable and its only if your pushing it, it stays perfectly still on my tv stand. I've only had it for 5 days but so far i'm in love with it. I bought the $30 3 year warranty just to be stress free. In  a short sentence, get this TV if you're looking for something in this price range with great clarity and overall appearance. Also I love that it has the USB port! I used it today to listen to music and it was awesome. I read someone else say that headphones aren't too good in this Tv but i have to disagree they sound really good. I have a pair of Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil.

I purchased a Sceptre 19\" widescreen monitor five years ago and was thrilled with its quality, so I already felt confident in this television's quality.  2.) At the purchase price of $179, it was much less expensive than the 32\" Samsung I had looked at.  3.) It was not going to be our primary television, but a second set to stop the family from quibbling when programs conflicted.PROS:* Excellent value.* Bright, superb picture quality.* Crystal clear sound with adjustable equalizer.* Three HDMI ports.* VGA port allows for use as computer monitor.* USB port permits the playback of mp3 and JPEG images with slideshow.* Base allows for adjusting viewing angle.* Lightweight, yet base keeps set stable.* Instructions, screwdriver, screen cloth all packaged together.CONS:* Audio output (loudness/volume) isn't as strong as expected.* Remote not backlighted.* Only one wall mount bracket option (400mm x 200mm).I really like having three HDMI ports on this set. I have only two on my nice 42\" Samsung that I purchased earlier this year. The screen menus are clear and easy to follow, and set-up was very simple. Silly as it sounds, I even liked finding the instructions, power cord, base hardware and a small ergonomic phillips screwdriver in a heavy-duty vinyl pouch with a zipper seal.When I did my research on this set I saw reviews complaining that the USB port was useless. Really, it's not. It's only useless if you want a USB port on your TV to play back *video*. The instruction booklet clearly states that the USB port will allow you to display JPEG images ONLY (baseline, not progressive) and the set has a built-in slideshow feature. The set can handle mp3 audio file data rates from 32-320kbs. Your USB must be formatted as FAT32 or FAT16, and the largest file size the set can handle is 4GB. The set's USB port also does not handle USB hubs.The negatives about this set are minor, but one thing does stand out: the volume control. It's not the clarity-the set has bright highs once I adjusted the equalizer-it's the audio output that could be a little better. Adjusting the volume doesn't make a whole heck of a lot of difference between the 50 and 100 settings. Cranked up to full (100) volume, the set is certainly loud enough in a medium-sized room. Our set rests inside a large oak armoire cabinet in a 15 x 15 room and it works well there.The back of the set has only four mounting holes for a wall mounting bracket. The Olevia set this is replacing had six, allowing for more mounting options. Not a deal-breaker, but something to be aware of. And, of course, my other minor deal is the fact that the remote doesn't have a backlighted key pad. Most everyone now has cable or satellite, so the supplied remotes are universal and pretty clear to see, so (honestly) this is a petty issue.Would I buy this set again? Yes! No regrets here, and I would've given this 4 1/2 stars if I could have.

I paid $209 for this LED TV which would have been a real deal if not because of it's big flaw. Not sure if it happens to everyone or if it's just that I got the black sheep of these TVs. Anyways I'll describe the issue below.It happens that the two lower corners, specially the left one, have a strong yellow glow, that can be seen when the screen is black or when you are whatching a fairly dark scene at night, or when you are watching a movie in widescreen so that there's a black bar at the botton and top of the screen. This yellow glow is really distracting.I have noticed that if you apply pressure on specific points of the frame this glow will disappear, so I'll take it to a workshop to see if they can fix it. I have also noticed that the stain grows bigger the more time the TV is on. I'm not sure about what causes this but it shouldn't happen on a new TV.Still If you are planning to play bright, full screen scenes then there won't be a problem for you, since this glow/stain is not visible at daylight or when plaing something bright, it's just visible when playing dark scenes at night with the lights off.Thanks for reading and I hope it helps you make an informed purchase.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "CANT BEAT QUALITY  4 PRICE!!", "Author": "TEAO", "ReviewID": "R2QXOMLJJN28W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For  $200  this  Television is NOTHING  SHORT OF  AWESOME!!

I just wanted a cheaply priced TV that had a decent picture and decent sound (no weird humming or ringing).This TV was exactly what I wanted...definitely worth the price.  **Keep in mind that I only paid $179 for this model.  I would not be as happy if I paid $299.**The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the following:-TV frame is very cheap plastic and not quite perfectly put together.  Nothing really noticeable unless you're looking for imperfections.-The backlighting is also uneven.  When the screen is dark you can really notice it.  Surprisingly, it doesn't affect the picture to me.-The remote looks and feels very cheap.  It almost feels like a toy remote.  That doesn't bother me though.Let see how this does long term...I will update my review if anything happens.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "If it comes on, it's really good.", "Author": "MagnoliaSouth \"As soon go kindle fire with sn...", "ReviewID": "R1IF2Q9DDMC99Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Right out of the box, the TV refused to come on. I called the manufacturer, thinking we'd hooked something up wrong, but no. There should be a home screen if the power is on despite if anything is hooked up to it, according to tech support.He said he could send a replacement (he emailed me a form that I am not happy about because I have to fax it to him along with a copy of the invoice, this is an additional expense I shouldn't have to make) and then once I got the replacement I could send this one to him. While I was sitting there on the phone with him, the TV suddenly came on. Odd. We turned it back off and no surprise, it wouldn't come back on. About 10-15 minutes later it finally came on again. lol! It's the strangest thing. The tech guy said it should not take that long to warm up. He said he thought that maybe it would do that if it were about 40\u00b0F, but one, it had been sitting in the house a couple of hours and two, we live in Mobile, Alabama. It rarely gets 40\u00b0F and even more rarely that temp in November! It was in the 60s when it was delivered.So, we're leaving it on until the new set gets here. Now all that said, let me talk about its function. Keep in mind, this is obviously a defective TV set. When the new one comes, and I've no idea how long that will be, this may change.My non-HD Directv picture isn't all that great. In fact, I'd say it's slightly blurry. On the other hand, the HD picture from my son's games and the bluray and even Netflix are all amazingly clear. I think it's just time to upgrade my Directv receiver.I don't use the TV sound because I have a surround sound system. However, I will say that it works beautifully with even the oldest surround system known to mankind. Ours is a 1996 RCA, with RCA (red and white) plugs... I kid you not. It was top of the line in its day, but it is ancient now. Unlike our other TVs, this new one finally has an RCA out plug for old stereos. I couldn't believe it! That alone makes it worth its purchase, in my opinion.There is still a problem though. You would think that since the TV is putting OUT the sound, that it (TV) would control the volume it is sending out via the jacks, but nope, it doesn't. That means you'll have to use yet another remote, the one for your receiver. If I had one serious complaint, that would be it. Even my ancient rabbit ear TV would at least control the volume out via another source. I'm not sure why this one failed on that.It's very lightweight, has tons of plug options and even swivels. I really do like this TV. I just wish that it powered up better because were it not for that, I'd keep this one.The other thing is that I want you all to know that the tech support was very helpful. I called at 5:30 p.m. CDT and not only managed to get someone, but managed to get someone who speaks clearly and I didn't have to wait but less than 1 minute. I couldn't believe it. That is always a good sign. Also, he emailed me the forms and by the time I hung up and got to my desk, it was in my inbox. I love companies that treat you like a valued customer and this one did just that.All in all, I think it will be a good deal. If only it worked right out of the box and I wish I didn't have to go through the trouble of sending it back.The link to download the PDF manual is in the first comment under my review here.UPDATE: Just got the new set. I first contacted the manufacturer but I didn't like their exchange policy. I would have to fax (I don't have a fax) a copy of their form that they emailed to me and an invoice (which Amazon doesn't send with it) that I would have to print out from my Amazon account. Then I'd have to wait for their ship labels and once I got those, I would have to take the TV down to UPS or wherever. I ended up exchanging it with Amazon and they'll even send someone to pick it up. So much easier!Anyway, the new TV works like a dream. I'm very satisfied. It takes no more than 5 seconds to turn on. That was fresh out of the box. I'm not sure if there is a battery in there, but after being plugged in overnight, it came on instantly the next morning.All in all, I'm very satisfied but I do have to recommend some sort of external speaker system. It has a headphone jack, so if you can find external speakers that have that same jack, you may be able to use those.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Confusing Model #'s and Specs-but all GOOD!", "Author": "E.

The reviews were for Sceptre E325BV-HDH and I could not find any reviews for the E325BV-HD model.  I went to the Sceptre website and found that they are indeed 2 different 32\" Tv's with different specs.  The 325BV-HD indicates a refresh rate of 6.5ms (HDH=8ms)and brightness spec of 420 cd/m2 (HDH-250 cd/m2).  The measurements were also different with the 325BV-HD width of 1.88\" and the HDH model 2.1\".  The measurements in width/height/depth(W/and W/O stand were also different. I read many reviews for the \"HD\" model on the Walmart website (very positive)so decided to place my order there.  It was \"comforting\" to also notice the positive reviews for the \"HDH\" model here on the Amazon site.Anyway, I received the TV yesterday and guess what!?  The model I received was the E325BV-\"HDH\" model as reviewed here!  I didn't bother to inquire about the mix-up as the TV has a very good picture and after playing with the audio settings it also has pretty good sound for placement in a bedroom.  In fact, I cancelled an order for a soundbar as I feel that the TV speakers are above average for a small LED TV. I, also decided to keep this model since at the Sceptre website the MSRP is $599.00 compared to $499.00 for the \"HD\" model.  I know, MSRP is ridiculous!  But, go figure, the specs are actually higher on the \"HD\" model with the lower MSRP. I also know that these specs don't always indicate one model is superior over the other.NOTE:  FEDEX delivered the package in it's original box with a huge split/tear all the way down the front of the box.  I feared the worst, since it was the side with the screen facing the tear- I slid my hand inside and pulled it apart (expecting a cracked screen) and saw no damage.  FEDEX truck was long gone!  Anyway-easy set-up and darn good picture quality for only $179.99.  Despite the confusion/mix-up in model numbers, I'm completely satisfied (the reviews here and at Walmart assured me both models were highly rated).  Also, wife just noticed an approx. 1/2 inch dent/scratch on the top of the surrounding bezel/border-very slight and hardly noticeable.

Now the reason you don't know their brand is because they worked for larger companies (having them slap the labels on their manufacturing) until their branched out on their own.I was a little hesitant to buy this at the price of 150$ because the last debacle I ran into with a 37 inch Proscan PLED3792A was terrible for 250$ I had to take it back. Later, I found out I got this one for a steal!Pros:-Easy interface with plenty of options. (So many, if you aren't a techno-geek like me you wouldn't know what to do with.)-Great Value for the price-Quality (so far had it 3 months, no problems at all.)-WORKS GREAT WITH COMPUTERS (This is an awesome + for me)-Displays in 1080p downstream even though it says 720p (means it doesn't offically display in 1080p, but will support it) don't even notice the difference from my friends 1080p at this size. (As long as you have about 6~10 feet distance away from the screen)Cons:-Contrast ratio could be better (just comparing it to my Asus VE228H, so take it as you will)-VESA 200x400 mount! (The 37 inch proscan worked with my mount, but this smaller TV decided to go with the larger proprietary VESA screw setup. I had to pay 20$ for an adapter, but with the money I saved, worth it!)MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT MOUNT! Otherwise you will end up paying some extra money for an adapter for this guy. Otherwise, I love this thing.

I got it on Amazon for $199 delivered. It is light, thin, and very sleek looking with a nice polished bezel.

Typical packaging you might get with a monitor (well packaged), and came in perfect condition.Here are my pros, and a couple of cons:Pros:1) Thin, light, nice looking2) Good picture quality (720p) for my particular need3) Good assortment of input connections (3x HDMI + all the other standard connections you may need)4) Great value for the price5) Comes with a couple of extras that are nice to have, that don't even come with more expensive tvs that I have bought (microfiber cloth for dusting screen, mini screwdriver for installing/removing base, batteries for remote....etc)6) Sleep button on the remote instead of embedded within a menu somewhere (my Phillips TV doesnt have a sleep button on the remote, and it is annoying, this is the only reason why I mention it.Cons:1) I didn't like the placement of the coax input. The way they placed the plug makes it a little difficult to connect the cable. If you have stubby fingers like me, you may need a wrench to tighten the connection2) To switch source inputs, you have to click source, then use arrows (tow different buttons). If you frequently change inputs like I do, it would have been better if you could just click source to cycle through the various inputs.I would recommend this TV without hesitation.

This TV will be used only for the kids and I was not looking for the highest video quality.

I am currently using the coax. at this point, but I am always in the need of a VGA and audio input so I can connect a computer to the TV.The TV is light in weight and can be moved around easily.The Bad:So far I am happy with the purchase and have only one complaint.

The fact Wal-Mart sells this brand/model should have been a red flag, however, it had so many favorable reviews I took a chance and for the most part the t.v. itself had functioned just fine.  The unit doesn't receive much use; pretty much I watch the news and an occasional sitcom or PBS show and that's about it. No sports, no Honey Boo Boo, no movies.Less than a year after purchase, I watched the late news, went to bed, and when I turned on the t.v. in the a.m. there was audio but no discernible picture.  Colored stripes were going across the screen, so I checked all connections, etc. thinking the dog may have knocked a cable out.  No issues there.  I contacted Sceptre's 1-800 customer service line 3 times over this past week and left a voice mail requesting a call back each time (I don't believe they really have any live folks handling the phone lines in hopes everyone will just e-mail), and just today received a call back from an individual who was quite rude.  He stated they cannot figure out what is wrong with the t.v. until I take a picture of the screen and e-mail it to them.  Can you say STALL TACTIC?Undesirable company, but perhaps I'm one of the few who got a lemon and had to deal with their customer service.

Very thin design, lightweight.> Great picture quality with PC input, HDMI, HD Tuner. Just as good or better than Samsungs that I own on these inputs.> Sound is not great, but does decently well.> Price was incredible. Bought for $180, free shipping w/ Prime.> Packed well. Others have said that they hit the touchpoints, and they do. They include a nice Microfiber cloth to clean the TV, as well as a screwdriver to install the base.Bad:> SD tuner is really poor quality with some channels. Before you say it's my cable or the splitter, know that I tried it on a number of settings. Some channels were ok, but there were lots of signs of interference on the SD channels. Nothing on the HDMI, PC, or HD Tuner channels. Just know about this if you're planning to use only for a coaxial connection and need SD channels. Not a big issue for me--I have a cable box with this TV.> There are some small distortions of light around where the speakers are placed in the TV. Not a big issue, but you do notice it when the screen fades entirely to black.> This is a small detail, but the manual is written in decidedly poor English. As you're buying an off brand TV, it doesn't instill much confidence. Further, I looked up the SD tuner issue, and the answer provided was basically \"this TV is soooooo amazing that it picks up distortions you didn't even know you had.\" My other HD TVs don't display such distortions, so that was a little bit hollow.> No optical audio port. There is a regular stereo headphone port if you want to put speakers in. Not a big deal for me. It's not a great sounding TV, but it's a bedroom TV that cost $180, so won't fault for that.Verdict:> If you get this TV for $200 or below I think it's a good buy. I've really enjoyed mine.

(media)Remote laid out well, good touch, many shortcut options like screen aspect ratio, guide and info for tv.Excellent tv digital tuner.Cons:As with other reviews of this device, Bad sound, from speakers and headphone out put both. That is the only reason it is not a 5 star. Most people have a stereo or surround system with an aux input, and if sound is taken from rca jacks, it is fine.Also as with another review, there are a couple of small blotched spots at the bottom of the screen, but primarily noticeable only when the screen is blank. You have to look really hard to see them when the picture is on, and you can only notice them with certain color combinations, and then you had better be paying close, close attention to those spots and not the program you are watching. So they are transient and hardly noticable even when they are there. Not a reason at all to downgrade this TV in my opinion, considering the price.Price:I got this at the Black Friday price of about $180.00. I was leary of the name, but the price and reviews finally convinced me. I have looked at vizios, samsungs, etc. and this TV is comparable to the other LED models I have seen in picture quality.

When it got here & I opened the box I will tell you I have never in my whole life seen anything packaged so well.  And I don't mean just the tv.  The tv itself was packaged in something other then styrofaom that when you take it out of the box it gets all over your lviing-room...you know that kind I mean...this however was not!  It was wrapped with this thicker plastic like substitute & was so easy to take off the edges of the tv & didn't make a mess everywhere!  Inside the box was a little plastic case, almost like a pencil case with like a ziplock bag zipper to open it.  Inside was everything you needed all packaged separately in ziplock baggies.  I was so impressed when I found an actual screwdriver.  Not just one of those cheapies you get in a kit to put stuff together.  It was a small screwdriver much like my Dad always carried in his pocket his whole life.  I also received batteries for the remote.  They were wrapped separately from the remote & not in the remote(got something once the batteries were in the remote & had exploded, yeah fun).  Assembly of the tv was super easy!  And hooking it up I got it in the first try!  Usually I have to move wires around 7020392031 times before I get it right.

It has all the usual handy buttons, but what I like about it is that you can add channels to you favorite list (and remove them) just by pressing one button and the channel is added instantly. Then you can easily browse your favorite channel by using 2 other keys on the remote.- The menu is clear and easy to navigate.- Tv is easy to set up, it will take you no more than 10 minutes to unpack it and install the base.- Several HDMI output, Usb output- Came with remote batteries and screwdriver for the baseCons:- The sound is ok but don't expect too much here. The Tv is very thin so you won't get large speakers with that. You can totally use it in a leaving room though. Just don't expect to have a party and be able to watch tv at the same time.

For those gamers out there: hooked up my PS3 and I didn't experience any sort of lag at all! Great picture though Sceptre does provide a lot of settings you can tweak.My main issue is the sound (and why it's a 4-star instead of a 5): My HP Pavillon dv7 laptop has better speakers than the Sceptre (though it could be because it has Beats Audio), and listening to the TV from my headset, it sounds very hollow and tinny but just change the audio setting to Dynamic and it's a lot better, but still just decent. But hey for what I payed for this TV ($179 + tax), I can live with the okay audio because the picture quality is great for the price, $300 or more and I would start to have issues. Sceptre also provides a cleaning cloth and a screwdriver for the base, and like another reviewer mentioned it's all packed very neatly.I will post pictures soon. If you can get this TV for around $200, it's a great investment.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Big bang for the buck!", "Author": "Purvertedmunk", "ReviewID": "RDYIIG64L80T2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just like most people, I was very skeptical about this TV because #1, I was not familiar with the Sceptre brand. #2, the price is dirt cheap, making me wonder if this deal was too good to be true. I went for it anyways because of the other positive reviews on Amazon. And just like most people, I got the TV delivered to my door step utilizing the free shipping option. It did not take very long to arrive, I ordered the TV on Thanksgiving night(Thursday) and got it by Tuesday afternoon. I immediately unboxed it and installed the stand. It was very easy to install the stand, all it took was 5 screws to the bottom of the unit (screw driver and screws included in package). I hooked up a blu ray player and watched a few scenes of Avatar to check out the picture quality, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. I messed around with the picture settings and was able to improve quality just by \"eye balling\" the TV and settings(I will be investing in a HDTV calibration DVD shortly).All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase. Not an ounce of regret was felt by me and my wife when we saw the TV in action. For those of you looking for a secondary TV to place in a small room, this is it.

In one corner and along some of the edges (even a little in the upper middle of the screen) when viewing dark scenes it is lighter than the rest of the TV.

You can't adjust colors the way I'm used to on my main 46\" LED TV, but it doesn't require much tweaking to begin with.I do have two issues to address that a cable management junkie like might like to know:1.  The power connection is nothing different than one for a computer or a laser printer.  A big 3 prong plug and straight connection to the bottom of the TV.  This makes a flush wall mount difficult, as it would have been nice to have a 90' connection on both ends.2.  The way the plastic blocks the bottom connections, where the antenna in and power in connections are located, are blocked by the plastic molding of the TV.  Not a deal breaker, but definitely something to keep in mind.  I'm going to look at purchasing both a 90' power cable and coaxial cable to help manage the connections on my side.Overall, I'd recommend this to someone who is wanting to get a bedroom TV or guest room, or for a child to use as their main TV.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Got the Job done", "Author": "Captain", "ReviewID": "R300VVI385G1SY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is being used as a tailgater monitor.

Sure it's a good value, maybe even better than a \"good\" value, but that alone doesn't make it 5-star material IMO.I find fault with the sound system: Speakers that are aimed down will NEVER sound as good as speakers aimed AT the audience. The adjustable 7-band equalizer sure helps, but adjusting it is \"clunky\" & won't fully overcome the poor speaker placement.I find fault with the brightness/contrast: If it's adjusted so that dark areas can be seen, bright/white areas are washed out. If it's adjusted so that bright/whites are not washed out, dark scenes/areas are fully black.I find fault with the fact that I must see \"SCEPTRE\" for 3-4 seconds before the TV \"turns on\" every time it's switched on. Like I can't see the manufacturer's name at the bottom/front of the TV?I find fault with the IR receiver on the TV: The remotes MUST be aimed AT the TV to work while my satellite box & old Sylvania crt will receive the IR signal bounced off the wall. This makes volume/mute changes from bed much more awkward.Finally, I can't, FOR THE LIFE OF ME, understand why there needs to be a bright red light lit on the front of the TV when it's turned OFF! WHY?!? I can ALMOST understand why there needs to be a light showing when the TV is turned on, but when it's OFF?!?!?!? WHY?!? No matter how small, it's still a needless power vampire in that respect, one that's now covered by black electrical tape.It's a good, even VERY good, $200 TV, but IMHO has too many faults to warrant more than 3 stars.

This yellow haze was very noticeable during dark scenes, which pretty much ruins most TV shows and movies for me.I wanted to exchange the TV for a new one of the same model, but Amazon informed me that they couldn't because they were out of stock at the time. Instead I just returned it and the Ol' Man got his money back.Although the TV was messed up, Amazon's customer service was excellent as always and the TV was easy to return. I'm gonna look for a bigger TV now, so everything kinda worked out in the end.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Upset but happy", "Author": "beto2k2000", "ReviewID": "RJEQIR94NZRE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First review i have ever done and unfortunatly it is bad.

When I installed the TV the stand was defective and therefore the TV stood crooked. I contacted SCEPTRE customer service and left a message.  They never got back to me. The following day I called their sales department and of course someone immediately picked up.  Since their address was 25 miles for my house I drove to get a replacement stand. The replacement stand worked for the most part except its still a couple millimeters off. The individual I dealt with at SCEPTRE was nice but their overall customer services practices are shady at best. The overall quality of the TV is average but I guess you get what you pay for.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "happy mee", "Author": "Jimmy", "ReviewID": "R10ZJ2D2L2VJW8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "got this tv as it said on the delivery date its overall a nice thin hd tv. i was overall happy with the product jus one thing is that i get these weird glares side to side but overall im extremely happy with this tv was cheap nd everything was easy to set up. it wud been cool to get a mount for it but other then that im happy and satisfied!", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice", "Author": "red", "ReviewID": "R343MPU2ZOMOH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very good picture> bang for ur buck. i wonder if the latger sizes have the same picture quality. good buy, good quality", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "SO FAR SO GOOD...", "Author": "Jeremy B.
