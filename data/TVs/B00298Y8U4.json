{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing picture, CNET was right!", "Author": "Noni", "ReviewID": "R34R4D4WWCZ5EQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has an amazingly beautiful picture, with deep darks and bright colors, and good saturation even in soft, light colors that might get washed out on other TVs. Scenic panoramas are so realistic! One reviewer said they thought the picture was too dark overall, but I can't understand why, unless it's being watched in a very bright room. My experience is that we had to turn the LED backlight down a lot to make it dim enough and save our retinas. We're very impressed with the picture quality and the sound is even impressive for a TV, but we still hooked it up to the stereo system, because of course that's better. But we were impressed with the audio quality as far as TV speakers go.There was an issue with 1 of the 4 HDMI ports not working, however LG said for any TV over 30\", they will send a technician to your home to repair any issue not caused by customer abuse, and this would be covered, but since we only really need 2 inputs, it's a tolerable defect. One other small complaint is that the HDMI ports have a loose fit, however, in three weeks, we only had to tighten once and they're holding steady. The ports are just around behind the screen, easily accessible without going behind the TV, so it's no problem. These issues are minor, and I would still choose this TV over others for it's great picture quality! I'm very happy we bought it, and at such a great price. And for LG's fabulous customer support, 5 stars.The seller was great (Video & Audio Center) and shipped it same day for free. It arrived in just a couple days.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "I live in an apartment and love this t.v.!!!", "Author": "E S", "ReviewID": "R36VD30N1299YY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I will talk about this shipping rather quickly(audio & video center-I hope that's the right name?)from Cali. It shipped in the tv's original packaging,and opened it to see it was in perfect condition. I did have it shipped to my place of business(furniture warehouse)just because I knew the fed ex guy and was familiar with having to make claims if it was damaged. It was fine!Got tv home put 4 Phillips head screws into the base,make sure to make them tight and Do Not Strip the heads.The tv isn't very heavy if you move it alone, but since it is my new baby I had a friend help me carry it.The size is rather large because the frame of the tv.I am guessing this is one of the larger 42\" tv's(size wise).I had to fit mine into an Armoire,It was very close to not fitting.So if you are tight on space measure well before you get this tv(it is also kind of a tall tv).I read there are issues with viewing angles,well I live in a one bed room apt. and have no problems at all.I sit center of tv about 8 ft. away on a larger sized sofa(looks fine from one end to the other).I also sat in my recliner about 9-10ft.away(sitting in chair tv is at my 2o'clock)Looks fine not perfect but unless you have an expert sitting there it is fine. It also sits up about half a ft. above eye level.Still no problems.As far as colors go,Whites can be blinding,Blacks are deep and can be too dark if not on the right setting.All others look crisp and beautiful.Ok, I am no picture quality expert,but I love tv and movies and games so, Testing my Playstation 3.Playstation 3- Tried watching Lost season 1 on Blu-Ray,OMG! It makes abc's hd channel(I think it is only 720p) look like standard definition.The opening scene when Jack wakes in the jungle and looks up into the bamboo is jaw dropping,the whole show looks incredible!I just played Heavy Rain(Video Game) and Dante's Inferno(Video Game), Again Jaw dropping. Colors are vivid,as close to perfection as one can get.Cable Box- I do have an HD cable box from time warner.I watch alot of sports and movies(HBO,Showtime)I recorded the superbowl in HD knowing I would get my Tv soon after the superbowl, Well the colts jerseys were as blue as can be and the white on the jerseys were great,the saints jersey looked unreal(in a good way) Gold and black looked really cool mixed with the beautiful green field.Looked like I could see almost every blade of grass.Well the big networks all look good however like I said Earlier, I watch Lost and abc's 720p showing of it is disappointing.The winter Olympics on nbc look great the white snow is very lovely and all the colors of the skiers and hockey players are wonderfully vivid and sharp.HBO and Showtime have great HD Images,I recorded Watchmen on HBO(well only 1hr of it,God it is so long)knowing I wanted to test my tv when it arrived.Looks the closest to blu-ray quality than any other channels. Oh and STANDARD def. viewing, people who say it is awful on this tv are crazy or get a weak signal.I do however get standard def.through my hdmi cable not the coax so maybe that has somthing to do with it.Standard def.is not great but it is watchable and wont upset you unless you are a stickler...I have an X-Box 360(through component cables) I haven't played it yet but i'm certain it will be good.Also I own an Lg surround sound system(simplink ready) so I can't say how well the speakers work,when I did turn the speakers up when first plugging in the tv(static was on the tv) I turned it up pretty loud, again it was only static but it sounded loud in my little apartment.The tv's remote is good not great but I do like the backlit buttons,there is also a button to turn on and of the backlit buttons(I thought that was cool).much easier menu's than previous lg tv's the quick menu option is rather neat and easy to use and switch between picture options.Finally- This T.V. was one of the cheaper LED's I found out there for it's size.It is always risky buying online and having electronics shipped long distances, My experience here was great so I'm 2 for 2 when buying tv's on amazon.someone on another review said it best, Most of the bad reviews come from the small percentage of people who did have issues and problems,who are looking for solutions and answers.Most others have no need to talk about how great there tv works(does that make sense)If you are seriously considering this tv then don't pass it up,If you have the funds to go bigger and better than yeah, you should...hope this helped some of you", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "One of the best LED-backlit TV's for the price", "Author": "L.

Brightest picture, deepest blacks, and best colors on any LCD TV I've seen. The contrast is simply amazing, which I attribute to the local LED backlighting. The only issue that I found is that when you have a dark area of the screen with a white object, such as text, the screen has a tiny bit of \"blooming\" around that object, but only visible when viewing the TV at an angle. Trust me, this issue is barely noticeable. Overall the backlighting is more uniform than edge-lit or non-LED backlit displays.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG 42LH90", "Author": "S.

Cunningham \"ma1746\"", "ReviewID": "R30KCB8TBH9LG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this tv from adorama camera through amazon, and let me say while i was VERY nervous about buying something so large and expensive online, i am happy to report this transaction was better than any i have ever had in a store. The first obvious hang up was not being able to see this tv's picture in person, but honestly i dont believe the major retail stores accurately display these tv's anyway due to differences in feed (standard dvd through blu ray) When i first opened the box (delivered 6 days after my purchase) i found the tv in immaculate shape, no damage to the box or any of the components inside. The tv was very easy to set up, i replaced a 32 inch sony bravia lcd in my bedroom with this model, and its an absolutely incredible upgrade in every way, and i loved my bravia. I have this tv hooked up to an hd dish network receiver, and a ps3. Games and blu ray movies are unbelieveable, i also have a 46\" samsung lcd in my basement and thought that that tv had the best picture quality i have ever seen untill watching this one. The colors are incredible in this model, the clarity is astonishing, and you have the ability to manipulate the settings to your liking. I must warn you that when you first plug this tv in, you will get a sinking feeling in your gut like you made a mistake. This tv absolutely needs to be calibrated!! I know very little about programming tv's, blu ray players etc, so i went to CNET and used their recommended picture settings with some minor alterations. I tend to like a brighter picture, so i use the vivid setting with some tweaks. For some reason, the 240 hz feature to me makes the picture appear worse so i turn that off, as most reviews state to do. But this tv when calibrated to your liking cannot be beat. I debated between this tv, and the samsung un40b8000. I absolutely love my 46\" samsung, and the company name obviously speaks for itself. But with that stated, this tv is cheaper and fully led backlit while the samsung is side lit. My only problem with the lg is the cabinet size, it really is massive for a 42\" set. But if i had to make the decision again, id purchase the LG in a heartbeat. You will love this tv", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent LED LCD", "Author": "O Shepard", "ReviewID": "R2D0190NFYJDXH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this HDTV to replace my old 32\" Sony LCD. I choose this HDTV after examining many HDTV's at local stores and comparing reviews online. I had decided that I wanted a LED full backlighted HDTV and that I could only go to 42\" because of space limitations. The need for no more than a 42\" set considerably limited my choices because local stores did not stock hardly any of them. One uninformed salesman in a major chain store I will not name even told me that the 42\" size was being phased out and tried to push me over to the 46\" sets. I also did not want to spend a lot of money for new LED technology. I did not buy this set from Amazon because Amazon changed vendors from Vanns to Adorama. Not that Adorama is bad. I have purchased from them before and highly recommend the company, but Vanns is closer to me and I have purchased from them as well in the past. I did not know why Amazon switched from Vanns to Adorama, so I went directly to Vanns website, saw that they had plenty of LG 42LH90's in stock, and bought one.The LG 42LH90 exceeds my expectations.  Clear bright images, better sound from the HDTV than others that I examined, and enough adjustment controls to satisfy any tech nerd. CNET's review was accurate. Contrast is very good with solid blacks and whites. Overall the image of this set is superior to the 32\" Sony Bravia that it has replaced.We shall see if I can say the same a year from now.Amazon's description is somewhat misleading. Amazon lists the HDTV's dimensions as '3.7 x 42 x 28.2 inches'. True, but only for the screen. Add the stand and the true dimensions are '14.2 x 42.1 x 30.6 inches'. An important fact for those who have space considerations.The LG 42LH90 has one annoying flaw. Although you can label inputs for easy switching, you cannot label channels. This is an irritating inconvenience for those used to selecting channels by name and not frequency numbers.Another minor flaw is that the Koreans have a long way to go before they can produce a good clear understandable manual.They also fail to include a printed version with their product and  instead include the manual on a CD.  This does not even make sense as a cost saving measure because they did include a printed manual that included some information but not the essential data needed to set up the HDTV for viewing.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Brief review of LG 42LH90", "Author": "Walt Wagner \"Walt\"", "ReviewID": "R25Z8GV2XFKVMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are more detailed reviews before this one so I choose not to be redundant.  Set-up is easy and the remote is simple and easy to use.  This LCD has full array LED backlighting.  The real thin LED sets are using edge lighting with diffusers.  They are OK but the light is not always evenly dispersed.  It appears more mfgs are using edge lighting since it is probably less costly to produce and the sets are much thinner.  Either way, the LCD sets with LED backlighting give you an amazing picture.  Sound quality is average as most of thr newer sets seem to be designed for use with a separate sound system.  The frame of the 42LH90 is not as narrow as other sets thus making it look king of bulky for a 42 inch set.  The pedestal mount that comes with the unit is somewhat wobbly.  It is a buyers market right now so you should be able to get a local retailer to offer the set for the same price as on line.  I did.  Expect to pay $1000 to $1100 right now (early May 2010).  That's not much money for a 42 inch LED, 1080p, 120Hz(quasi 240Hz) HDTV.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG 42LH90", "Author": "tyDesign", "ReviewID": "R1OVADVNTPWGT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No Complaints so far.

Crecca \"Psychonewb\"", "ReviewID": "R2X5J4LLR3QF0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking around for a 1080p TV for a long time to upgrade my room and I finally came to buy this TV and I would never look back.  I wanted a TV good for gaming, has great picture clarity, and of course good HD playback whether it be Blu-Ray or HD channels on cable.  This TV has lived up to all of my expectations that I had for it except for one problem.  The 240Hz \"TruMotion\" even when on low has some distorting effect on moving background images.  Usually nothing that takes a lot away from the overall picture and nothing that lasts more than a couple seconds but I always seem to find those things.  I am convinced it is the 240Hz considering I have watched the same movies on 120Hz 1080p LED TV and there was only very slight distortions.  When playing a Blu-Ray on 1080p, it is less noticeable than if you where watching HBO HD or some other Cable TV HD channel.Picture clarity and brightness are phenomenal!  We have the Samsung 55\" LED set downstairs and when I compared it almost looked like this LG was brighter and was more clear when playing a Blu-Ray disc, or playing a PS3 game.  Sound quality is very good of built in speakers.  Usually I can't let it go over 40 otherwise it is too loud when comparing it to the Samsung, sometimes we need to put the volume all the way up to 85-90.Overall I am very happy with this TV for the price that I paid for it, I just bought a new Blu Ray player to replace my Samsung P1500, I will be hooking up a Panasonic DMP-DB85K later this week to see if it will make any difference in Blu-Ray clarity.  So far the best movie that I have watched on this TV picture-wise is District 9... watched that yesterday and WOW it was an amazingly clear, crisp and bright picture.If you are looking for a closer to budget priced 1080p LED TV this would be the TV you should consider.EDIT:2 days ago I hooked up my Panasonic DMP-DB85K Blu Ray player and I will say there is a a slight difference over my older Samsung model.  I went through the settings on the DVD player and turned on the 24p setting (plays the dvd at 24 frames per second  which is what movies are recorded in) and there was a good difference in playback.I also played around with some settings in the picture menu, about the distortion about black edges/images... I turned the \"Black Level\" setting to High and I keep TruMotion 240hz to Low and I notice that there is less distortion on Blu Ray play back.  I will continue to play around with some settings and see if there can be any more changes I can make.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "it's what I expected", "Author": "Thomas Lund", "ReviewID": "R2IM5MBLOVD8K9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did alot of reserch before I bought and so far I'm impressed.

The picture quality is very good but the screen brightness leaves something to be desired. I've tried a number of things to brighten the picture to no avail.

I fed the audio to my Sony surround sound receiver with excellent results.  TV has a Kensington lock slot with which I have it secured.  It also has a hole in the TV base with which to tie it to the table.  While this is touted in the manual as an anti-tipping feature, I replaced the supplied screw with a 3\" long screw into a support web of the entertainment center as an added anti-theft feature.

So I knew this is what I was looking for.As others have pointed out, it was packed very well and delivered flawlessly.  It has a large bezel around the TV so it has a rather large footprint for a 42\" TV.  And it has good sound for a TV, so good that an external soundbar would probably be a waste.It has a number of features you wouldn't think about a TV having:-XD Engine to upscale lower definition video to look better on your high definition TV-\"Smart Volume\" Auto Volume Leveler for those jarring commercial breaks-\"True voice\" makes voice dialog more crisp sounding-Dolby Digital 5.1 decoder with ability to downmix it for the TV's 2 integrated (and hidden) speakersLast, but not least, this TV is THX certified for high picture quality.  Only a handful of TVs are THX certified.As [...] puts it: \"THX certified displays are tested to ensure they meet or exceed specifications in two areas. One is picture quality--device performance, in THX's words--and includes minimum specs for things like black levels, contrast, color gamut, brightness, resolution and uniformity. The other is \"signal\" (or video) processing, which includes things like sharpness, noise reduction, overscan, motion compensation and deinterlacing. All certified TVs are tested to make sure they meet or exceed minimum standards.\"As [...] puts it: \"Inside THX's test lab, we observed their array of test signals and procedures. In addition to the legacy test signals we and other reviewers use to evaluate HDTVs, THX created some of their own patterns.  THX tests signal processing, deinterlacing, color points, black levels and white levels among others criteria. They perform additional testing of display properties that are generally too time consuming or require special test equipment the HD Guru and our fellow reviewers don't possess.\"My personal test of whether a TV is high quality or not is while looking at them in the store some of them will have a pixelated, blocky look to the picture when looking up close.  This one doesn't.  The picture is as sharp up close as it is from far back.  The only negative I can think of is that it doesn't turn on instantly.  It takes about 20 seconds to boot up and turn on after you have hit the power button.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "One of The Best Led TV !!! Amazing", "Author": "Luis A.

I couldn't be more happy with the set.I have had two minor problems (neither really having to do with the TV).I got my upgraded cable box to process HD signal.  I noticed when I clicked on the INFO button on the TV remote, it always said that the current channel was 720p.  I emailed my cable provider and found that their cable box was preset to that level.  They told me the simple process to update the cable box settings (it came with absolutely no instructions).  I now get all HD channels in 1080.  I had always heard that on a 42\" TV and there was really little difference between 720 and 1080, but I found the picture to be much improved even at the 42\" level.My other problem is hooking up the VCR (I am hoping to avoid the additional $15/mo charge to my cable bill, but will probably have to bite the bullet).  Again I think the cable box is the culprit.  I hooked up the red/white/yellow connectors to the cable box and fed it to the VCR.
