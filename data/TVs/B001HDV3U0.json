It is absolutely stunning.  In short supply these days but if you are looking for the best PQ this is it.  60\" sounds big, and it is, but it doesn't take long for it to become your norm.  Bigger is definitely better.  Images have a vibrant, three dimensional character that is just absent from the others.  The black level definition is also unmatched.  While still a bit pricy, it is a bargain when you look at the original MSRP and consider the quality.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "After Three Years of Use, Still A Stunning Visual Delight", "Author": "Ed Lizardo", "ReviewID": "R8IZ4YZBPACJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Today, 17 January 2014, marks the third anniversary of my purchasing the Pioneer Elite Signature Series Kuro PRO-141FD.  Three years on and this 9th (and last) generation top-of-the-line 60\" Pioneer plasma monitor continues to wow my visual senses...and everyone else who sees it in action when they visit.  The black levels, detailed clarity, vivid color palettes, and high scan rates continue to display stunning high definition images - broadcast or Blu-ray.  Especially Blu-ray.Home Theater (now Sound & Vision) magazine in its April 2009 review  wrote, \"For overall performance on dark scenes, nothing can beat a Pioneer Kuro.  And make no mistake:  The better the blacks, the better the subjective image depth, even on bright scenes.  The deeper the blacks, the firmer the foundation for all material, from the darkest to the brightest.\"Ever since Pioneer stopped producing plasma displays in 2009, I've kept a keen eye out on the rest of the market to see if Panasonic, Samsung, Sony, or any of the other manufacturers would improve on the performance standard the Pioneer Kuro engineering team set with their last 9th generation Signature Series Kuros.  OLED appears to be the technology that can better the 9G Kuros.  The best of the LCDs have gotten very close - with proper ISF calibration.If you can find a 60\" Signature Series Kuro PRO-141FD for less than $9,500.00 in good or better condition, buy it.  I surmise it will be more than a few years before OLED 4K displays are affordable, and even longer before the broadcast industry upgrades from 1080i/p and the movie houses start reproducing their films on 4K.  It's expensive...and the 50Gb Blu-ray disc format will likely morph into another format altogether to accommodate the massive file sizes that 4K resolution will require.Pioneer's \"Signature Series\" is the result of a limited run created for entertainment purists.  Pioneer hand-selected each panel for perfection and runs them 100 hours for pre-burn in.  Precision parts and electronic components were carefully selected from the line, hand-inspected, and certified to exceed Pioneer's rigorous standards to assure optimum performance.  The Kuro panels are equipped with features to minimize the possibility of image burn-in.  I can attest to that:  on numerous occassions I paused the picture for inadvertantly long periods when I forgot or couldn't return to the set right away, and found either the panel darkened, or idled, and consequently avoiding any image ghosting.  Pioneer does include instructions on how to correct ghosting if it occurs on your panel, but my PRO-141FD has never exhibited any ghosting.The Signature Series' exclusive network- and custom installer-friendly feature sets aside, the PRO-141FD's most striking quality continues to be its remarkable illusion of depth.  High-def cable broadcasts are a marvel, and the best Blu-ray Discs are simply stunning.  It's a believable depth that can be watched all day without a headache, unlike the headache-prone gimmicky depth of 3D movies.  That depth comes from several factory pre-calibrated factors:  spot-on color, exceptional resolution, environment-sensitive brightness, and Pioneer's industry-leading black levels.Coupled with my Definitive Technology 9.1-speaker system (BP7000SC x2; BPVX/P x4; C/L/R2500 x1; ProMonitor 1000 x2), driven by a Denon AVR-4520CI with a Denon DVD-2500BTCI, watching movies and sporting events from my home theater system is sheer bliss...and it all starts with my Pioneer Elite Signature Series Kuro PRO-141FD.With the passing of time, and the ever-changing state of technology, I feel even more justified in spending $6,000 three years ago.  I narrowly missed the $3,000-5,000 price boat when dealers and independent speculators were trying to off-load their inventory in 2009 after Pioneer announced it was leaving the plasma panel business.  By the time I jumped on-board, inventory was nearly gone, and PRO-141FD prices began to rocket up to $10,000...and three years later, they're still up there over $9K.There are plenty of Pioneer PDP-series Kuros around, and when professionally ISF-calibrated, are excellent plasma displays.  Local-dimming LCDs with greaty improved black levels, viewing angles, and refresh speeds are more cost-effective nowadays, even sizes over 60\".  But purists pursuing pure visual delight with cost-is-no-object accounts, acquiring a Pioneer Elite Signature Series Kuro PRO-141FD is a highly recommended home theater equipment option.
