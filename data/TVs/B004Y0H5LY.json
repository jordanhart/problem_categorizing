{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV For Price, But Turn Film Mode OFF!", "Author": "Doctor Nick", "ReviewID": "RI56035JWW3IS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Good quality and value for the price. Picture Looks great! Wireless N connected easily to my router on 5 ghz. Netflix looks great.Cons: Film Mode is turned on by default in Advanced Picture Settings and this causes a lot of motion blurring and pixelation, but this is easily fixed (see below). Most LED Edge-Lit models have an inherrent problem known as \"Blooming\" since the backlighting is reflected from the sides. On the plus side, Edge-Lit models can be thinner, lighter, & use less energy. However, if you're not use to watching this type it can be annoying. During normal to brightly lit scenes the pictures look great. However, during more darkly lit scenes you will notice Blooming and it becomes worse the higher the LED Backlight is set. Blooming appears in darker scenese around the edges of the darkest objects on the screen. It appears as a halo of dark blues, purples, and shades of gray/black. It actually comes from light bleeding in from the surrounding lighter objects. You can play with the LED Backlighting until you find a happy medium (See my settings below).Comments: I purchased a Sharp Aquos Quattron 60\" LED/LCD 240Hz LC-60LE832U at Costco in December 2012 for $1,699. Out of the box the default picture settings make things look a bit fake like a Soap Opera. There have also been quite a few reviews on this site and others complaining about problems with fast motion scenes being choppy, having blurring, artifacts, & pixelation around the edges of moving objects. This shouldn't happen since this supports a refresh rate of 240Hz, which means that fast motion should be smooth & crystal clear. However, the refresh rate also depends on the source you are watching like SD, HD, or BluRay.I also experienced motion blurring, artifacts, pixelation, and choppiness around faster moving objects. I called Aquos Advantage Support and they asked me if Film Mode was turned on. They said this should only be used on very poor quality video sources to improve the frame rate. If this is turned on, it will actually cause these problems because it has to process the video before it is displayed.Turning OFF Film Mode fixed all my fast motion problems. Now fast motion scenes are completely smooth and crystal clear. I tested this on SD & HD chanels (including sports), & BluRay movies and they all look great. I have also played with the picture settings which has gotten rid of that \"Soap Opera\" effect. Everything looks really good now and my Picture Settings are:AV Mode: StandardOPC: OffBacklight: +1 to +5 (The higher you set this, the more you will notice Blooming in dark scenes)Contrast: +31Brightness: +5Color: 0Tint: +5Sharpness: +5Advanced Picture Settings are:Color Temp: HighMotion Enhancement: 120Hz High (AquoMotion 240Hz actually caused some dullness in Color & Brightness, and some choppiness in fast motion scenes. Even the best HD sources like Blu-Ray are recorded at 60Hz and a max of 29.37fps. When this is set above 60Hz the image has to be processed to add data between frames to make fast motion more smooth and clear.)Quad Pixel Plus: OnActive Contrast: OnGama Adjustment: 0Film Mode: OffDigital Noise Reduction: HighMonochrome: OffRange of OPC: N/A since OPC is offI think you will be very happy with this TV with the above settings. Of course you can always tweak the settings to your liking. I would also recommend you upgrade to the newest HDMI version 1.4a cables that support High Speed (10.2 Gbs or higher), Ethernet, 3D, Audio Return Channel (ARC), & 4K Resolution Support. You do not have to pay high prices at electronic stores for quality cables. You can buy high quality cables at low prices from MediaBridge on Amazon (see my reviews posted for these cables). Also, if you are using a Home Theater Receiver (HTR) and all of your video sources are connected to this, then I recommend turning off video processing on the HTR. This TV performs better when you just let the video signal pass-through the HTR without processing.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, Inferior Sound.", "Author": "Arjuna", "ReviewID": "R3I06XUTC6UAFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I walked into Costco a month ago and took a look  at the new TV's. I have been living with a 50\" 720p Samsung DLP that has served well. I saw this 60\" set and the picture was stunning. I spent a while comparing it to the other sets, many costing far more. This one and its 70\" sibling were the best by far. It was not even a contest. I took it home and installed it on a swivel mount on the ceiling in my bedroom and hooked it up to my 6.1 a/v receiver. The result is spectacular. The black levels on this set are what make it stand out. With a 6 million to one contrast ratio the picture just pops out of the screen. The 4-color Quattron system produces brilliant colors without over saturating. The built in WiFi is a bonus, NetFlix never looked as good as it does on this set.CONS:I then tried the sound on the built-in TV speakers and found them seriously lacking. Granted, the unit is only 1-5/8\" inches thick, so it's hard to get a good speaker in such limited space. You would definitely want to augment this TV with some kind of exterior sound system.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "S.

It was easy to set up and much lighter than I expected when mounting it on the wall.  The screen is huge while the bezel is small and when it is switched on it looks wonderful with HD sources.

Wow!", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R1ILIXTSRG7E4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have now had our Sharp, 60 inch, 240 HZ, LCD TV for two weeks.  It has by far the best picture I've ever seen in a TV, and there is not a close second.  The picture is great!  The sound is just fine.  Our plan was to wall mount it, and install surround sound.  However, it looked and sounded so good when we set it on our stand, that we do not need to do so.  We called Sharp to ask some questions about the built-in WI-FI, and setting up the NETFLIX, and they answered in one ring, and were extremely friendly, and completely helpful.  I am blown away by this television.  I am a new fan of Sharp!  I am watching it right now, and didn't realize until now that an ant can have acne.  O.K., I made that part up, but the crispness and sharp color does make me feel this way.  I love this television.  P.S. - My buddy bought the same TV in the 120 HZ, a week before we bought ours, and we love his as well.  I gotta tell you though, we do think the 240 HZ makes a difference.  We've now watched football, hockey, and basketball games, and it's like you are there.

All was good until 5 months later when the TV failed to power on. After 2 weeks now, the warranty dealer says the \"parts are on order\". After watching a 60\" for 5 months, anything any smaller really sucks. My backup is a 20\" monitor.I just don't think the new technology is built to last; not even close to the old tube types. I have had 3 LCD/LED models in the last 5 years.

Green \"jimmythis\"", "ReviewID": "R2VSBOFRCKBACB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After having the tv on for about a month I started to actually see the choppy images so many people havebeen complaining about.  The choppy images were even more noticeable on football games.  You could reallysee it when the offensive team snapped the football....choppy for a few frames then smooth after that.I started to research the internet group threads on this particular model.  I tried all the settingsrecommended especially making sure the film mode was set to off.  I still had chopppy images even whiletrying to watch Halmark or Lifetime channel.  I bypassed my in home theatre and went straight from theDish box to my Sharp.  No help.  Tried using 2 different HDMI cables...one of which i paid more moneyfor since it supports higher resolution and is gold plated.  No help.  The only time I got smooth imagequality ALL THE TIME was to set the TV mode to GAME.  If you notice in Game mode there are several featuresthat are disabled by default of which you CANNOT enable.  They are:  Color Gamut range, Motion Enhancement,and Film mode.  Only when I selected this mode did I get smooth imaging all the way around.  Now having saidthat I tested MOVIE mode on my XBOX 360 and had no issues.  Seems the biggest issue for me is the digitalprocessing by my DISH reciever.  This may help some of you who have given up or just got so frustratedwith the signal processing.  I like the MOVIE mode because of the soft backlight....its way easier on myeyes at night.  Everything else seems to work very well on the TV other than the choppy image issue.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - Internet ready but no browser", "Author": "Ellen Valinotti \"isabellasmommy\"", "ReviewID": "R1UONMLHDUSGZK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV thinking it was the perfect package.
