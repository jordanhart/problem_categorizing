Dilyard", "ReviewID": "R2TKEXVE4XELOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm gonna break this review up into 2 parts. 1st part is about input lag, second is about the 3D and the TV itself.Part I.First off, I have had this TV for 2 days. Right after I ordered it, I started reading about input lag and other things. I'll be honest, It got me worried. I'm a regular gamer, and that's really what I got the TV for. So when it first arrived, I set it up and popped in Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3.. Without changing any settings. I noticed that there was some input lag, and it was a tad annoying..BUT it was PLAYABLE in my opinion.Then I turned off Tru Motion by changing the picture setting to \"Game\". I really didn't notice much of a difference. It improved by, 20% maybe? This was when I was starting to get worried.. I did a little research and found a sneaky trick/fix. So far, it's worked great. (Knock on wood, I'm truly loving my TV to the fullest now!) Below are step by step instructions.1. On your remote, press the input button.2. Then push the blue button on the bottom right hand corner of the remote. It says 3D settings but that's irrelevant right now.3. This will open a window to change the name of the input.4. Choose the PC name.When you change the name of the input to PC, it turns off almost all of the image processing that comes with the HDMI input. So far, It has worked GREAT!Part II.Setup was relatively painless. I haven't setup the 3D Bluray player yet, I'll update when I do. My first 3D experience was with Halo CE Anniversary. I must say... INCREDIBLE! I wasn't ready for things to really come out of the screen. I guess my expectations were a little low. But hey! It turned out to be a good thing!The 2D to 3D is pretty sweet. I have found that it doesn't work great with everything. Sports, sitcoms and movies are pretty cool when up-converted. But talk shows and news isn't anything special. Of course, the LED and Tru Motion make everything silky smooth. Makes everything look almost fake, I personally like this.When I opened the packs of 3D glasses, I was surprised, they weren't black, but white and orange! I kinda thought this was cool, you could call it a pleasant surprise.I'll be updating this review as I use the TV more over the weekend. Really get into the nitty gritty of the settings. Please rate this review as helpful!**UPDATE**I just would like to say that I'm incredibly happy to have helped many of you with this problem! I know it can be a real hassle of shipping and returning such a large item. So far, I still have had ZERO problems with lag, and it's been a real treat. The 3D image quality still ceases to amaze me, especially with the price point of this TV. GREAT VALUE!The geek inside of me is a little ashamed, I still haven't fired up the 3D Bluray player yet, but I guess that gives me another reason to update this review again. I hope all of you are enjoying your TV's, and if you haven't jumped to ship to purchase one, may I firmly suggest to do so now. You won't regret it.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 3d tv", "Author": "crow11ad", "ReviewID": "R20QY3UYGVCX0C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok we have had this tv for about 3 weeks and love it. It's 55\" of 3d greatness. Now you may see 3d tvs from Sony or Panasonic that once you put those heavier glasses on, you might see some flickering. Those tvs are.called active 3d and this LG uses passive 3d. Basically the screen is coated and the glasses do the rest.Now passive 3d is the same 3d you may see at the movies, so the glasses from the movies will work on this tv. Keep in mind with the active shutter glasses coat $50 -$100 +, you get 4 free included and you go to the movies and bring those home and thats more for everyone. If you wear glasses, these will fit over your glasses or read my review of the clip ons.This set comes with a 3d blu ray player which rocks. Neither the tv or 3d blu ray is networked to get on the internet, except the blu ray for bd live and updates. This is fine and helps keeps the cost down.Now you can watch regular tv, dvds and blu rays in 3d with the help of on the fly 2d to 3d conversion which rocks not only for regular viewing, but for games as well. Playing Call of Duty on the 360 or Uncharted on the,ps3 is awesome once you hit the 3d button. Last night I tried God of War Origins collections that is a 3d enabled game and all I can say is wow.Also 3d blu ray movies are amazing. If you get this set or any 3d tv, I would recommend Imax Under the Sea. Keep in mind the ps3 also does 3d.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this TV", "Author": "Bryan J. Bowen", "ReviewID": "R265PZG5EOJQ62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV about 3 weeks ago for a really awesome deal. It had all of the features I was looking for. It is extremely easy to use and change the settings. Which I high recommend you do. The trumotion feature to me makes everything look a bit sped up which some refer to as soap opera effect. It can easily be turned of via the menus.The picture is crystal clear the sound is whats to be expected from a flat panel set. Watchable but nothing amazing.Now I had ZERO intention to buy a 3D set. Mostly because I wasn't that interested in most things in 3D. This one uses passive 3d, meaning you do not need expensive glasses to use it. The ones from the theatre will work just fine.My set did come with 4 pairs anyway. and you an get them on amazon for very inexpensive anyway. The actual 3d effects are astounding, and the tv will convert any 2d into 3d, this however leave some to be desired if you are used to things shot in 3D. But still a nice feature. Overall the only feature I could say would be nice for some is a the apps some smart tv's have. I could care less since I have access to nearly all of those between my PS3 or XBOX360.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "All Around Great TV, Including GAMING", "Author": "Benjamin Oliver", "ReviewID": "R2DDQQJAP05DKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this up on Black Friday, so I've only had it a couple days. I did tons of research on this and went back and forth for months whether to get another plasma (I previously had a 42\" Panasonic plasma 720p from 2005) or to go with an LED. The apartment I now live in has a fairly bright living room with a door and a window to the right of the couch, so the glare was becoming a problem with the glass screen on the plasma. However, I've always heard and read that plasmas have the best pictures. Look at CNET's list of best HDTVs. It's dominated by plasmas. Even the top rated LEDs contain the words \"with black levels approaching that of plasmas.\"Well I decided to take a chance on this LED and just return it if it didn't live up to my expectations and boy am I glad I did. My glare problem may well as be 100% gone. I still get a little when the living room lamp is on, but it is NOTHING compared to the glare I got on the plasma. Actually, with the plasma, it's better called a reflection, because it was like looking at a mirror. I'm still messing around with the picture settings, but I've got it set almost where I want it. Still can't decide if I like the \"soap opera\" effect offered by the TruMotion (you can turn it on and off). You definitely want it on during sports.A word about gaming: This TV is great for it! These other people on here complaining about it clearly didn't read some of the other reviews. You can change your input type to GAME or PC to eliminate the input lag. When I first turned on Modern Warfare 3 it was unplayable. I was terrified that I'd have to return it and get another plasma. But after I read the other guy's review on here and changed my input setting, all is solved! Here's what to do:1. Change your TV to your gaming input (whatever HDMI or Component input you have your system hooked up to)2. Press the input button again3. Press the blue button at the bottom of the remore labeled \"3D SETTING\" (N/A in this situation)4. Scroll through the menu and select PC or GAME (I use PC just because that's what the other guy recommended and can't tell if GAME is the same or not.)This will eliminate all (or most) of the image processing that occurs within the TV and eliminate the lag between when you move your fingers on the controller and what happens on the screen. It will make the picture a tiny bit worse, but I'd rather be able to actually play my games than have them look a tiny bit better.Concerning 3D: I didn't even want a TV with 3D. I looked at (and actually bought, long story) the 55LV4400, which doesn't have 3D. However, I read some things about the picture quality on that not being the equal of the LW series, so I went with this one. I've always hated 3D, even in theaters, but this TV has completely changed my mind. The 3D picture quality actually looks BETTER than 2D. I'm really glad I have it now. I haven't hooked up the 3D Blu-Ray player yet so I can't comment on its quality.Bottom line: You won't regret buying this TV. If having a smart TV isn't importnat to you (or if you already have an Xbox 360, PS3 or Internet capable Blu-Ray player) and you want excellent picture quality (2D or 3D) in a bright room for around $1000, you can't go wrong here. I consider myself very technically savvy and I spend tons of time researching and reading before I make a big tech purchase. Save yourself the same time and headache and just get this TV.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "MissE", "ReviewID": "R3PX2SI47GMB8M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this TV not on Amazon but at a store ...I looked all over for reviews and could never find one so I wanted to rate it...Freaking awesome picture and its wonderful to be able with a flick of a button go from 2d to 3d.  Clarity is fantastic.  I dont care that someone said the sound is horrible we have not had any issue with it nor do I need a sound bar for it.Its a great item fantastic picture and I love being able to watch movies in 3d whether its on cable or from the blu ray.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "This LG LW5300 Has Made Me A Couch Potato.", "Author": "J. Pearson \"A Family Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R1QVSEKS5ZGLWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was never a big TV watcher before I bought this 3D TV, now I spend to much of my time in front of this set watching Blu-Rays, 3D movies, converting 2D shows into 3D, and streaming 3D from comcast, (which is excellent in 3D) also this LG has caused me to get into gaming again with the PS3, which I use for my internet connection on this TV.This is my 2nd LG TV. I bought my first LG HD TV about 5 years ago (42LB5D)  which also is a really good set that still works flawlessly and still has good picture quality and sound, no issues with this set at all and the surround sound my old 42LB5D produces is awesome at times I think my 7.1 surround system is on, but the sound comes from my old LG.  I am really picky when it comes to watching TV, even though I hate to sit in front of a set and waste my day away, when I do, I like to watch my content in really good quality. Every little flaw I can see in the image really bugs me, things like motion blur, poor contrast and color and ghosting when it comes to a 3D set, so I really do my research and pick out quality TVs when I look to buy one. I said all the above to convey to you (the reader) that I like a quality TV sets, and I went with the LW5300.In my early online research, demo watching, and inquiring about 3D TVs from sales people, I was leaning toward a plasma sets, also because a plasma cost less than an LED or LCD unit I was wanting a plasma, that was until I read more on 3D TVs and the glasses needed to view them, either active and passive. In giving thought to the  real-life use of the glasses I decided to go with passive glasses. My thoughts on the glasses are.... Passive glasses are cheaper, no charge needed therefore longer time of use, comfortable to wear, if your kid sits on them or scratch them, they only cost about $12.00 to replace not $150-$200.00. When friends come over to check out your TV, which you will love to show them, you do not have to spend $300.00-$400.00 for two more  o n active 3D glasses, not to mention the ones just for your family members. So theses things got me leaning toward the passive glasses.I read that you get true 1080p in each eye with Active glasses, and only half the resolution 540 in each eye to equal 1080p with passive glasses, but not with this LG. The image is for sure 1080p, really sharp, no softness in the edges.Motion blur and sharpness: They can be adjusted on this set, there are good tweaks with this unit, but I feel there could have been more, however what they have are enough to make an awesome picture.  It is not perfect, but from watching TV  extensively these last few days I have only seen motion a blur very, few time times,. I am very picky when it comes to a good TV sets, and I was count the motion blur in this set next to none (it's not perfect). and the color and clarity of this set always amazes me when I walk into the living room when this set is on, and I have yet to calibrate this TV. ( to busy watching it.)The sound...it's not that bad but it could do better. LG,and I would say all the makers figure the majority of the people are using an external system of some sort and put less emphasis on the speakers. With that said  for general use the sound is perfect on this set,, but you may have to reach a higher volume  number to get it to a usable level. when I watch my movies I then use the 7.1. so the internals gets the job done.licensable.When it came to the screensThis TV has a matte screen, there is some glare but nothing like a glass screen at all. My wife did not even notice it until i asked her what she thought about it, and I do not notice it until i look for it, so i would  I would give this screen a grade of \"B-\"only because there is an glare on the screen, but it could be much worse, it's really not noticeable in my home I hear all the talk about the deep blacks on a plasma set, but I assure you the blacks on this LG LW5300 are very black indeed. Setup was easy. , I set it up with my 4 year old son, super easy to mount onto the base which swivels.viewing 3D... it is perfect... to get the people standing in your living room it all depends on the quality of the content you're watching and it does happen at times, but in general your subject will not pop out of your TV set, but you do get really good depth of field that is what 3D really is, and with the right content you will get some good pop, (in your living room pop.) it's all about the movie and the scene.There are lots of movies in 3D now,and more to come, just look at whats in the theaters now, there are also a lot of 3D streaming movies to view.2D to 3D works really really well i think most people will like it, I do.I do recommend this unit if your looking for a 3D TV, you may not need the smart version of this model if you have an wifi ready Blu-Ray player or PS3 already.I hope this review has helped you. please let me know if it sow, and if you have any more questions please let me know, thanks.I did not give it 5 stars because of the screen glare, the lack of aback lights on the remotes, but that goes back to maybe the majority of people are using universal remote, and less emphasis put on this matter. this is a very good TV. picture looks very good and you will love it.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Best TV I Could Ask For", "Author": "John Garner \"hopeless tech addict\"", "ReviewID": "RTN2P2PRSQ4PH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every once in a while, a product is priced far below what its quality should demand.  As LG attempts to shift the 3D market toward \"passive\" glasses, they've made this a prime example, in all the right ways.  For the amazing price I paid, there's no set within five hundred USD that can even come close to the features and quality this TV has.  Here's a short rundown:- The 2D to 3D conversion algorithm is the first I've seen that actually works (most of the time).  Another reviewer posted a great list of what works and doesn't about this.  I'll move on.- The overall user interface is just flat out gorgeous.  From the second you turn it on and it splashes a simple \"life's good\" across the screen (love that) to volume adjustments that show a virtual knob spinning with the numbers in the middle, to 1-touch access to all the menus that matter, you'll never be hunting long for anything you want on this TV.- The \"jack pack\" is plentiful.  3 HDMIs, and about every other input you could want.  Awesome.- USB playback support.  Toss a standard USB drive in there and enjoy AVI content you...  found.  AVI, yes.  MKV, no (a minor loss; spend a few bucks on an Acer Aspire REVO, then install VLC or Media Player Classic to solve this problem)- 3D quality.  That's what all this passive stuff is about.  No flickering, no loss of sync, no battery changes, and if your child/dog/enraged ex steps on one of the glasses, you can laugh knowing they're ten bucks.  Or...  you could just go watch a 3D movie at the theater and keep the glasses afterward; they work with this TV.  Ignore what some of the review sites say; with a proper source (try IMAX Under the Sea or Disney's Beauty and the Beast) there is no ghosting, crosstalk or flickering.  It's incredible.- Longevity.  It's LED backlit, so no three hudred dollar bulbs to change every couple of years.  The set should make it ten years without a hitch.  I know you'll buy something better before then, but that just means this becomes the bedroom TV, right?- Built in calibration assistant.  Makes it easy to get MUCH better color reproduction than competitors.  Yeah, you can't beat a professional ISF calibration, of course (which the set also supports natively, by the way), but this will put you well down the right track.- It comes with a Blu Ray player with USB smart play in the box.  Which means it's not just the best value in TV, it's everything you need to make any room 3D BluRay capable.  At no additional cost.Cons:It's a stretch for me to find real \"Cons\" that I can't work around with a settings tweak or such.- Remote sensor on the TV has a narrow range of angles it can sense in, so sometimes it'll miss your clicks if you're off to the side.- Would have preferred HDMI3 not come out at the angle it does- Speakers are weak; a soundbar and a subwoofer will help improve the experience immensely.- Doesn't walk your dog or pick up the kids from daycare.Buy it and never look back.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not suitable for gaming or fast motion", "Author": "Kevin Stewardson \"technophile\"", "ReviewID": "R3HHBXWU8EVB76", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review is mostly going to focus on using the TV as a gaming screen just to add a different perspective.  I had seen some demos of LG's higher end LW6500 TVs with gaming systems connected showing off the 2D to 3D and the benefits of passive 3D.  So I was sold, I picked up this LW5300 bundle thinking it was an excellent value and a good way to get into 3D.Now the 3D technology is great, I tested both with a game that did native 3D as well as with a regular 2D game using the TV's 2D to 3D feature and the results were excellent.  The glasses are light and comfortable and sitting down to a long game session was no problem at all, I didn't end up with a headache.The image quality is excellent in both 2D and 3D I thought and there are plenty of customization settings to fine tune the picture to your preference.This is where the love ends though.  The LW5300 doesn't seem to be tuned for fast motion video sources running at 30-60fps, that's the best way I can put it.  There is a noticeable lag between what you do with the controller and what happens on the screen, it's not huge lag but in fast motion like shooters where you're trying to line up your cross-hair on a target, this produces over and under correcting problems.  In Gears of War 3, doing an active reload I would hit the button to stop the slider bar and the bar continueded to move for a few milliseconds farther than were I intended it to stop.Next up I connected my laptop to the TV (I should say the laptop and console were both hooked up via HDMI inputs on the TV).  I use my laptop as a DVR so I frequently use it as a video source for watching shows.  When I moved my mouse around, the pointer would start moving a few milliseconds after I started moving my finger and when I stopped moving my finger, the pointer would continue to move stopping a few milliseconds later.These problems may not be that big of a deal for watching BluRay movies or watching broadcast TV.  But when you have fast motion devices hooked up that rely on speed and accuracy, the LW5300 doesn't seem to be up to the task.I'm not sure if the higher end lw6500 sets that are 240hz would be better or not, they're a lot more money and after my experience with the LW5300, I'm not sure I want to gamble on them or not especially since I can't find them locally to try first, I'd need to have one shipped.  When I had these devices hooked up to an old 24\" monitor that is 60hz/8ms refresh times (The LW5300 beats both of those specs), I didn't have these problems so it seems like the LW5300 image processing is just under-powered.So bottom line is if you're a gamer looking for a passive 3D screen for your gaming setup, you should continue looking, this isn't what you're looking for. Possibly the LW6500 line would work better but I'm not sure I'm going to spend that much money personally on a gaming TV.  On the other hand if you just want an entry level 3D TV/BluRay system, the results were excellent for that type of use and this bundle is a great value.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent value, excellent TV", "Author": "Phillip L. Avery", "ReviewID": "RW630O6NLJFAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Passive versus active was my main concern when I purchased this set. I also wanted a complete system. I did not want to have to piece all the needed elements together and hope it would work. This LG set was one of the best purchases I ever made. It has very good contrast with good solid blacks. Being that it is Led it also is bright and crisp and does not wash out. This is very important especially when viewing 3D. This blows away many of the plasma active sets as far as brightness and black values go.I had read many reviews both technical and from average people on 3D TVs. Plasma versus LED, active versus passive, Vizio, Samsung, Mitsubish, Sony and of course LG. All the sets once you considered the extras you'd need were just plain too expensive. I was almost set to buy a Samsung active set when the passive sets started to take off. After much more research I settled on LG mainly because I know they are a good company and I did not want to pay $89+ a piece for the 5 active shutter glasses I'd need as well as $150 or so for a 3D player the other sets would have required. This LG set fit the bill.I was concerned about the reviews that said that the set is not true 1080 when viewed in 3D, that the resolution is halved because it has to alternate images between each eye and cuts resolution. Let me tell you this is a technical aspect of how the TV works, no human would be able to tell the difference. The picture is beautiful in both 2D and 3D and the 3D effects are as good as or better than in a movie theatre. I read many reviews talking about horizontal scan lines you could see and blurring of fast motion etc... Let me put all that to rest. If you are concerned about any of that you do not need to be. It's reviewers and tech people nit picking details. If you want a very good picture and fantastic 3D this is the right TV. IF you want a complete, ready to go set (minus one HDMI cable) this is the right TV. IF you are okay not having all the internet/smart tv stuff built right in this is the right TV. You can add all of that easily with a Roku or Wii even.The controls on this set are also very intuitive if you work with electronics and menus at all. I had the set up and running, picture totally adjusted to what I like and was watching a 3D blu Ray in under 30 minutes. If you do  not want to get into the details there are many preset setups for the image you can quickly choose, but if you are like me and want to tweak every setting it's all in there as well.Bottom line is this set is a great deal, works well and is well worth the price. Passive is the way to go if you want great 3D without the hassle of very expensive 3D glasses which need to be recharged and kept safe. 3D glasses from the theatre also work well with this set. If you've been on the fence about this set it's time to get off it, go out and buy it.

However most will never notice what this bad boy cannot do cause everything it does do is awsome. We were looking for a smaller tv with 3D capability for our front room. It is hooked up to a surround sound system so speaker quality was not a concern. It would be just for the nights our small family would sit down for a theater like immersion. It fit exactly what we needed. It has excellent picture quality, a matte LED screen for high visiblity & low reflection, and the 3d experence is great. The included 3D Blu-ray player is linked so when you put a disc in, the tv comes on and goes directly to 3D. It uses the same technology as the theaters so their glasses will work, which is great because we had a smaller pair from the local theater for our young son. We got a great deal on it, but bought ours in store. We didn't need a top of the line 3D TV, but with the state of 3D content and technology as it is, this is one great package.

This TV can do 2D HD and 3D HD resolution, as well as standard 480p.  It has 3 HDMI connections, 2 sets of RCA jacks, coaxial cable jack, component jacks, and VGA connector.  It has 2-speaker stereo sound (speakers located underneath the TV screen on left and right) as well as a headphone jack, and optical audio output connector.  And it comes with a separate 3D Blu-Ray player and 4 pairs of Cinema 3D glasses (2 white and 2 orange).The TV's size is perfect for our small living room, and costs hundreds less than a 47 or 55 inch version.  It has a great picture for 720 and 1080 resolutions in 2D.  Even most standard 480 resolution, at a distance, looks pretty good.  However, some movies and TV shows have too many black bars around it, making the actual picture smaller.  This can be resolved most of the time by using the TV's Cinema Zoom feature.  There are lots of other settings that can be modified for the picture, including a picture wizard for you to choose the best looking picture.I must warn about the \"TruMotion\" technology.  This is used by most 120Hz LCD TVs to smooth out hi-definition movement.  It actually looks strange, so I rarely use it.  It is sometimes called the \"Soap Opera Effect\", as it makes movies look like a day time soap opera production rather than the normal film that we are used to.  You can turn this off from the menu, which I believe puts the TV back into 60Hz mode.The audio is not the best, especially if you are used to surround sound, but is fine if you turn the volume up.  We are not used to surround sound at home, so it does not bother us as much as other people I have read and heard about.  The headset jack is ok, but does not work very well with external speakers.  I hope to get a stereo receiver some day that has optical audio input to try with this TV.I also like using this TV as a large computer monitor by connecting my laptop to it with an HDMI cable.  I then use a Logitech long-range wireless keyboard and mouse to control it remotely from the couch.  It is just as sharp as a small computer monitor, but requires zooming if you have the font size too small.  I use the Microsoft Windows magnifying glass utility.3D is the primary reason that I purchased this TV.  The 3D on this TV is really good, especially considering that 3D is fairly new (past 2 years:2010-2011) to the home market, not including the old blue-red glasses technology.  As advertised, this TV has Cinema-3D technology.  I have dreamed about having the same 3D effects at home as I saw at Disney World since I first visited EPCOT Center in the early 1980s, with \"Magic Journeys\" and later, \"Captain EO\".  Finally, after almost 30 years, it has arrived!The great thing about this Cinema-3D technology is that it uses the same non-electronic glasses that you have at the movie theater.  This makes them cheaper, no charging or replacing batteries, and no headaches from electronic flicker.  We have the 4 pair that came with the TV, plus many that we saved from 3D movies that we had to pay $2.50 per pair for anyways.  Compare that to about $100-$200 per pair of the electronic version.There are several modes of 3D on this TV.  The best being from the 3D Blu-Ray player.  It is high-definition, smooth, and has accurate depth.  The other modes are simulated 3D.  Almost any video shown on the TV can be converted to 3D.  This includes television, DVDs and Blu-Ray discs, computers, and video games.  '2D to 3D' is the most common conversion.  It gives more depth than anything.  Then there is also a conversion based on motion.  Whatever is moving on the screen looks 3D.  Then there is side-by-side and top-over-bottom, which I have used primarily to watch 3D videos from  YouTube.  Those probably look the best, next to 3D Blu-Ray.  The '2D to 3D' does not usually have the pop-out of the screen special effects, but the latter 2 that I mentioned do, especially the side-by-side.  I have seen some pretty good pop out of the screen effects on YouTube using that.I really like the 3D effects, but I have to agree some with the annoying warning that comes up every time that you have to put the TV into 3D mode from the remote.  It can cause some funny eye or head feelings if you watch for a long time, especially the converted 3D.  So be careful.Please note that this TV does not have the internet apps, like YouTube and Netflix, built-in as the LG 5600 series does.  I knew that before I bought it.  However, the Blu-Ray player does have some apps with internet connection.  But I just use my laptop most of the time instead.  Also, it does not come with HDMI cables.  So I ordered those through Amazon for only a few dollars each, compared to over $20 at most local stores.Overall, I highly recommend this TV for standard, high-definition, and 3D video.  But if you don't care about 3D, then you can get a lower cost TV of the same size (42 inches) instead.  I paid a little over $700 for this TV, but could have got the same size without 3D (and without 3D Blu-ray player included) for several hundred dollars less.  But if you figure in the cost of the 3D blu-ray player, it is not too bad, even if you don't use the 3D.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "For those have a dimming issues while gaming..", "Author": "Mustang", "ReviewID": "R1PPQUC99RJL6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a GREAT 3d tv for this price range.  the picture is nice and crisp but when you turn on the tv at night, the tv was not so bright compare to the day time viewing.

The 2D to 3D isn't all that great, but with the 3D content growing rapidly and some providers looking to add 3D this isn't that big of a deal in my opinion.  The picture quality (in my opinion) is much better than the LG 60\" Plasma and the 55\" Sony led/lcd that I was using.  The sound, like most newer sets, could always be better.  If you have a audio set-up though it will not matter too much.  The player that comes with the set-up leaves some to be desired, but functions as it should.

This is my first big purchase from Amazon.  I will say that the TV did not arrive overnight as I had requested.  I did call Amazon and all the customer service representative were extremely nice and they assisted me in getting the TV.  The TV arrived 2 days later and I was given a refund for my shipping cost by amazon and also a $10.00 discount for my next purchase, which i thought it was great customer service.The picture on the tv is amazing.  I dont have cable or satellite service so I just use the regular antenna and the picture is amazing.  I could just imagine when I get cable with the HD channels how it will look.  I connected my xbox 360 to the tv using HDMI cables which I also purchased on amazon for 13.98.  In case anyones interested the cables are \"dCables Hi-speed HDMI cable 3d ready sold by Dcables management LLC\".  I looked around other stores and the cost for the HDMI cables was absolutely ridiculous.Netflix, Hulu, and ESPN 3 look great on the Xbox. At first I did encounter a problem with Lag trying to play Call of duty Modern Warfare 3.  It was extremely annoying  I read different blogs and went on youtube and many of the fixes were not working.  i was at the point of returning the TV.  However a day ago I read a post HERE on Amazon from G. Dilyard posted on November 24, 2011 on a fix for playing XBox and the fix works great.  I am not getting any lag and I am back to my killing streaks on COD modern warfare 3.The 2D to 3D conversion works great.  I have watched shows on netflix and changed them over to 3d and it works fine.  yes, you wont get the depth you would get at the theaters but you could definitely see the the 3D effect.  it works perfectly fine.  I had movie night at my house, which I am sure I will be having more often, and all the kids loved it.So in conclusion if you are in the market for a new TV I strongly recommend this bundle.

I have a 2006 Samsung DLP 720 50\". This tv never ever gave me a single issue and looked good, but it was no 1080p and it was time to upgrade. I always had samsung TVs and recomended it to over 8 of my friends and not a single one regreted it. I have calibrated many tvs including my sister's and brother's LED LCD samsung. I always calibrate my TVs using the HD Essentials, using color filters, and the actual sitting distance with small background ambient light for limited light contamination.I got this deal from amazon prior to black friday for less than $1199. I have had a chance to install it, calibrate it and give it a run. I will try  to get right to the point on task and facts. Got it out of the box and was very easy to install the stand. My cable, HD DVD, PS3, Wii and XBOX360 all run via my receiver, so it was a breeze to hookup. 1 HDMI cable!The menu simple, yet good looking and gets things done. Input naming was simple, and calibrating my TV was a breeze. I like the fact you can assign the calibrated presets to all inputs without having to do it one by one.  I recomend turning off energy savings, as in my case, it brought the backlight down quite enough, which might not be needed for you, but on my room, which gets tons of sunlight during afternoons, i needed it. 120Hz its not as exagerated as in many samsung LCD sets my friends own. I like it adds depth, but doesnt make it look too fake.This HDTV doesnt have smart capabilities. I can care less, maybe you do enough for it not to be the right tv. But my PS3 already has netflix, hulu, i have mediashare on my Android tablet and phone, so all my content i ever want i already own. I dont need my TV to do so. Speakers work fine, not great ones, but its what i expect from a TV anyways. Since i use my surround sound, i can also care less about it.  I managed to sell my old DLP for $550... so i have made a great investment and was able to get this great Tv for about $650... in my book, this can not be beat at all!I compared this to Sharp LCDs, and Panasonic Plasma's, and the PQ for this LG is better, its just as good if not better than Samsungs LED-LCD. its just simply a beautiful tv.PROS- instant fast boot up. WOW this thing turns on fast!- Blu Ray 1080p pic quality its amazing and provides great colors (not overstaturaded and good skin tone)- Blu Ray 3D is great, no jittering, no blur, no tired eyes and colors are not \"dimmed\" by glasses- 2D to 3D conversion works rather impressive- even TWC 1080i content looks way way way better- non HD content like DVDs look better and smoother- 3D Gaming (GT5, batman, MK) look awesome and SHOW NO LAG (even COD MW)- sexy looking Tv... even 3D glasses are cool (orange, white)- 3G glasses fit comfortably over prescription glasses, and in my case with a big head, they were comfortable too.CONS- No Smart TV (not really a con, since i can care less, but for you it may)- Must press OK every time it switches to 3D content. Maybe there is a setting, but i havent found it. My PS3 does too every time i start a 3D movie...- Speakers are not the best, but they arent crappy, its what its expected off a TV. Dont let other people exagerate.- physical touch buttons do not light upIn conclusion. I am glad i bought an LG. As far as years of service without hickups, its yet to be seen obviosly.

I bought LG for the non-glare screen over the Samsung with the shiny screen as we live in Florida and have a lot of windows in the room where it is located.  The only issue we have is that at night when the room is dark, the screen darkens, even with table or floor lamps on.  The room must be very well lighted for the colors to really be bright. In the store, under the florescent lights, the picture was fabulous, just like it is here during the daytime. I find the dark viewing annoying, but the resident teenagers find this completely irritating and want to keep the overhead (heat producing) can lights on, which I then find irritating.  And so the battle of dark vs. light continues. It boils down to whether you watch TV in a bright vs darker room most of the time.  This is a really good HD TV for bright rooms.  If most of your TV time is at night (or in a dark room), as ours is, I would pay the additional $300 for the Samsung and deal with the daytime glare on the shiny screen.

My older (1997) 50\" flat panel projection tv was still compatible with most components, but it had no hdmi inputs, and it was starting to show it's age. It's hard to look for a smaller tv to replace a big screen, but I decided to wait out the inevitable price drop.

The dvd player works great, the picture is very clear, whether you are watching it in 2d or 3d mode. The big thing I've noticed, is that movies that were FILMED using 3d cameras gives the appearance of things on the screen coming right up to your face. Movies that had simply been given 3d in post-production typically show few things with great depth, but in most cases, so far, the depth is more general. For example: a 3d documentary I have about the oceans, has so much depth (it was filmed using 3d cameras) that some of the fish appear to almost swim close enough to look you in the eyes. And with the final Harry Potter film (not filmed with 3d cameras), the depth is typically contained within the screen's limits, except for the occasional spell and some destruction that appear to fly out of the tv.

Conway", "ReviewID": "R1JX36SPJ83096", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's been sad a lot so far, but I wanted to emphasize a couple things that a lot of people have touched on. Gaming is great and flawless - though not out of the box. Mine came in with the latest and greatest firmware so I had no upgrading there. I can use any of the 3 HDMI inputs, change the lable to PC and gaming is ready. When I go to watch a blu-ray on my PS3, I rename the track back to Blu-ray, and let it change the settings appropriately. Couple things: When you go to the input to change the title of the HDMI Port (Name it). When you put it to PC the screen will flash. This confirms the change went into effect and it basically will be running at 60hz with no post image processing (where the lag is generated from). Next. Adjust, Adjust, Adjust. You need to play with the 3D settings once you get 3D content on there to fit your eyes in a way. You can push the depth, change the perception angle, and a few other tweaks (Really just 3 adjustments). Don't follow anyones one setting for this. See what looks good to you, it's your eyes!Gaming is flawless, there is a hair of input lag that you can notice on a fast paced moment in Call of Duty, but the lag is really minimal. My first time playing on it I alerted my team members that there may be input lag that I'll have to worry about so if I kept dying for them not to wonder whats up. After the match started I was amazed to find no noticable lag. This kept on for a while till the match came to a grid lock at a certain point in the map, with both sides of the team hammering on one spot with lots of explosives, the graphics toll went up and the input lag became noticeable (especially on knifing). I have not had an issue in any other moment - so just be weary about knifing in moments like these!3D Gaming is no issue at all. There is a little more noticeable input lag (Especially in Black ops, terrible 3D experience IMO), but it didnt effect me in other games like Uncharted 3, and Crysis 2 (Amazing!). Killzone 3 was a neat experience, but I prefer it on non 3D, but again not bad enough lag to keep you from taking it online.Blu-rays look amazing. Sound is OK with my current setup, but that's about to change over to a Bose system to make up for the difference. In 3D it really varies with what movie you're watching. Some movies may be sold as 3D but they are really just converted to 3D after the fact, movies that were made for 3D will be noticablly better. Ice Age 3D . . . astonishing! Rio 3D . . . Good moments, but middle of the playing field . .. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part 2 . . . eh, the opening scene with the Dementors is really the best during that movie that I noticed even though it was marketted as a 3D movie. Haven't tried an IMAX movie yet, but I suspect it will be top of the class.Verdict is this - Buy the TV if you're looking for a good setup into the 3D market. The glasses are passive so replacing them is cheap, and to add more for friends is cheap as well (compared to active shutter which will cost 50-100 per set). The bonus Blu ray player is nice, but I just stuck it in another room on a different non 3D TV since my playstation 3 works flawless still was a nice bonus though. If you use it for Call of Duty - you'll be rocking most of the time, just watch for those explosive dog piles. Using it as a PC monitor is also flawless, but get a wireless keyboard and mouse, you won't want to sit close. Again, no input lag on the computer as long as you run HDMI out and in and labe the input as a computer (stops it down to 60hz). 5 Solid Stars based on Price, Function, and availability.*Side bar* Due to the size of this item it will probably be shipped Freight. Most companies will send it via CEVA. I had a GOOD over all experience just a BAD wait time. Call them, stay on them, and you'll be fine.

On my PC, I own a Nvidia 3D Vision Set for the past two years for my PC gaming. The 3D Vision uses shutter technology, and definitely works beautifully with a 120HZ Monitor.  Being a huge fan of all things tech, I've been watching the 3DTV market for the past few years, and finally it happened: Passive 3D! An affordable option which can feed 3D to a group of four+ without making you bankrupt.I transferred the Sharp to the bedroom, and plugged all peripherals (PS3, 360, HDDVR and Roku) into the LG. Fired it up and immediately noticed how the colors popped. It actually ran rings around my Sharp Aquos! I transferred some 3D tech demos I saved on my PC to a USB drive, then ran them on the LG and was blown away by the 3D quality. Clean, bright and wonderful depth! Next, I popped in a BluRay movie (Monsters vs. Aliens) and again, my jaw dropped. I understood that the passive tech on the LG is suppose to have one drawback: horizontal resolution is decreased in 3D mode, but I'll be damned if I can see any difference. The TV arrived the day after Thanksgiving, so we still had the Thanksgiving Day Parade saved on our DVR. We used this to test the 2D to 3D on the fly conversation and it worked out pretty nicely. It definitely adds depth to any 2D broadcast, but nothing compared to true 3D.As for gaming, the PS3 recognized I had a 3D TV from the start, and the few games I quickly tried (Wipeout, Uncharted 3 & Super Stardust) were mind-numbinlgy gorgeous. I didn't get a chance to try any 3D gaming on my 360 yet, but that's next!Overall, I couldn't be happier with my decision to go for this LG!Some quick notes:- Unlike my 3D Vision PC shutter set up, the LG Passive does not darken the screen; colors remain bright and vibrant!- My eyes were able to handle much longer periods of 3D viewing with the passive glasses. The 3D vision shutter would  screw me up for the night if I played a long gaming session wearing them.- The LG uses the same glasses they give out in theaters; go see Hugo and keep the glasses! :-)- Get access to YouTube on your TV, and search YT3D! The LG Passive supports a number of different 3D formats which work brilliantly with most of YouTube's 3D showings'; there's TONS to see on there!- The only ghosting I noticed was when you were not watching the TV from a normal viewing angle. For instance, if you stand up and move a bit close, you'll see overlapping images, but who watches TV like that?- The two negatives: LG supplies a set of two orange and two white glasses.

Yeah, the picture doesn't compare to my Mom's $2,000 Samsung but I also spent $799 and got a 3D Blu Ray Player and 4 pairs of glasses.SoundI don't think people realize that speakers on all LED TV's suck. It's a super thin TV, they can't cram giant speakers in it. I have a Sony 5.1 dolby system and was worried about being able to hook it. I was able to run an optical cable out to the surround sound and it sounds great.GamingI play COD Black Ops and MW3 and no complaints about lag. I believe you just need to turn off the TruMotion setting or switch the TV to the PC setting.

Just make sure to calibrate or follow other user settings for the best image. Although it doesn't have the blackest blacks or the whitest whites, it's their affordable 3D TV.

Before I go into this, I'll also let you know that I tried these things before and after upgrading the TV's firmware from 3.x to 5.x, and nothing was improved.This TV has an \"optical digital audio out\" TOSLINK port on the back, but it DOES NOT output 5.1 channel audio from external HDMI sources, even if the HDMI input contains 5.1  The digital audio out sends only 2-channel (stereo).  [See Updates in the review--you can gain access to hidden service menus to fix this, but it is a bit involved.]If you have a receiver with no HDMI inputs, this is a deal-breaker if you care about surround sound.  Here are a couple examples I tried, using my Panasonic SA XR-55 digital switching receiver/amplifier, which is a wonderful unit, but with no HDMI I/O:- ChannelMaster CM7000-PAL \"antenna DVR\" HDMI out to the TV.  TV digital audio out to the receiver.  Receiver sees only 2-channel audio even when HDMI content from the ChannelMaster has 5.1.  I also tried sending the digital audio output directly from the ChannelMaster, to the receiver.  In that case, the receiver saw 5.1 audio, but it was so out of sync with the video that it was unusable.  Neither the TV nor my receiver have capability to delay the video and/or audio to allow them to be synced.- LG Blu-Ray player (came with the TV) HDMI out to the TV.  TV digital audio out to the receiver.  The Blu-Ray player can output several types of audio.  I tried various types, but the result was the same:  the TV will only output 2-channel audio from that port.LG does not actually say the output supports 5.1.  In fact, they imply that it does not.  Under Specifications: Audio on the LG website, I read the following:\"Mono/Stereo/Dual (MTS/SAP)\"That doesn't say Dolby Digital, does it?  Sneaky, sneaky.[Edit:  I removed the comments about slight pixelation because I didn't see any of it the next day.  I expect the pixelation came from my OTA DVR box.]I'll likely be sending this TV back.  There are two possibilities which could change my mind:  1) LG replies to my email with a method to get this thing to output 5.1 sound, or,  2) I decide to buy another receiver with HDMI inputs.  However, I think that is a waste of money.  Why not spend it on a better TV?  [Edit: 3) or if I fix it myself, which I did.]I'll update this review if anything turns out positive.  Meanwhile, I'll warn as many of you as possible, away from this purchase.=== UpdatedAfter additional research tonight, I found a Q&A; from LG about this issue on the 47LW5600, which is the internet-capable version of this TV (yes, it's also 47\" vs. 42\").  I won't post the link, but you can Google this phrase to find the website, as well as the text of the Q&A;: \"deactivation of the AC3 processing\".Summary of the Q&A;:  On the LW5600-series (which is similar to the LW5300-series), the digital audio out will output 5.1 sound from 5.1 content from the internet (streaming, using that feature on the LW5600). However, for devices sending 5.1 audio through the HDMI inputs on the TV, you will not have 5.1 audio coming out of the digital audio out, because LG removed the AC3 processing on those HDMI inputs, presumably due to lip sync issues they were unable to solve or unable to control.=== Updated againNo thanks to LG Support, I was able to turn on 5.1 audio using one of the hidden service menus.  This required reprogramming my Harmony remote with one of several Proto hex code sequences, gaining access to the Service Menu (the Ez Adjust menu will also work for this), and enabling AC3 processing.  While there are tidbits all over the net, there is an excellent compilation of instructions from someone with the forum name \"metalmyth1.\"  Others have copied his/her compilation elsewhere.  If you Google this phrase exactly (including the quotes), you will find hits to two forums which list the compilation:  \"AC3 or Dolby Digital on the other hand can be passed thru to enable this\"After enabling 5.1, lip sync is not quite on, and it does not appear to be adjustable in this TV, even though I found a service menu item (audio sync) which allowed me to enter a number from -10 to 20.  It applies to HDMI input #1 only, and on my set, it seems to have no effect whatsoever.  My wife says she does not notice the delay in the audio since it is so slight.  I might get used to it.Because I was able to get the TV to send 5.1 audio (via hidden menus), I'm bumping the stars up to 3 and updating the title.  However, there should be a user-accessible menu to turn on AC3 processing and LG should not be hiding this issue.  In reply to my email to LG support about this issue, they merely replied that I would only get 2-channel audio from the HDMI input sources.  They did not offer any solution (which I found on my own). Shame on them!Here is the text of LG's reply:\"The TV will provide Dolby Digital Output when the TV is the source of the Audio. If the source of the audio is Netcast or Premium Application that supports 5.1 Channel Output, the TV should pass the 5.1 Signal using the optical port.If the source of the Audio is CADTV/DTV channels that offer 5.1 Channel Output, the TV should pass the 5.1 Signal using the optical port.If the source of the Audio comes from an external device, such as a Blu Ra player or Cable/Satellite Box, the TV does not pass the 5.1 Channel signal using the optical port. The connection must be a direct audio connection from the external device to the home theater system.\"[I tried the direct audio connection back to the receiver/amp.  The video/audio sync was terrible (and can't be adjusted on my amp).  TV manufacturers, as a whole, have not figured this out, but LG has made matters worse by making their HDTVs unusable for \"home theater\" without hacking into their service menus.]", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Glad I Did It.", "Author": "Vantageshop-com \"vantageshop-com\"", "ReviewID": "R1PNMDHFQMFR7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't buy big ticket items often so I did quite a bit of reading first.  I am glad I did and feel that this LG TV is the best bang for the buck and a great choice for our family.  We have two children who are at each end of the elementary school years, and this was taken into consideration when selecting a TV.  I selected this set in part because it has the best Passive 3d out there. My purchase decision was affirmed when I visited another household and the glasses all needed charged and the kids could not use the 3d feature on the other family's set. Seeing dog chew marks on the temple of the glasses while visiting further convinced me I had selected well. I can replace our glasses for a few dollars should they get damaged. The kids have no trouble turning on 3d feature to up-convert their PS3 games, and movies they borrow from the library or netflix.  They change between input selections with ease also.Computer input using the HDMI cable out from our laptop looks good on the TV.  I have not tried the VGA connector yet.  Up conversion from 2d to 3d is amazing most of the time.  On some media, however, this does not work well.  THings with dark backgrounds that are streaming from the internet just dont upconvert.  I suspect it is because the resolution and quality are so poor that there is not much for the LG to work with.If you need volume, plan to hook it up to a surround sound system or stereo amp.  The sound quality is acceptable using built in speakers, however volume is not great for big sound theatre style movie watching.  HDMI cables only cost a few dollars each at Amazon.com and through a major online computer related website.  A good surround system or amp will select between input devices if you need more than the 3 inputs built into this LG TV.Darks and lights are great.  I notice none of the uneven lighting that I have read about in some reviews if LED/LCD  HDTVs.  If you Game, read up before giving up on this TV as an option.  There are motion features and video processing features that need turned off for gaming.  IF sending game signal into TV through HDMI, this needs reassigned as a PC type connection.  DO this with the Blue 3d button on remote and look in those menues.Don't buy into the half the resolution arguement for Active 3D systems.  They alternate between eyes, so you only get 1080p half the time using their logic.  This LG TV looks great in both 2d and 3d modes.  Blacking out an eye at all times makes the picture seem half as bright with active systems, this system was noticibly brighter and crisper when side by side with its competitors in large box stores.  Also the 3d seemed deeper and more convincing in the up convert.  IF like me, you are sensitive to monitor flicker, and flourescent lighting flicker, definitely go with a Passive 3d TV like this LG.  I know I would not, as they say, \"adapt\" to the shutter method ACtive 3D systems use.This TV came with a 3D Blu Ray player.  For about, if not the same price, there is another LG 47 inch 3d HDTV that has built in Internet features, but does not come with BLU ray player.  If you already have a Blu Ray Player, or a PS3 game system, you might consider the other model, as it has a better contrast ratio and a couple more input options.  I have a dedicated media computer and didn't need to rely on the limited built in internet features, and can put the blu ray player to work elsewhere.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG 55LW5300 55-Inch 3D-HDTV Great Value", "Author": "J.

The menus are easy to figure out and use.I love the 2D to 3D conversion so you do not have to purchase true 3D movies, though true 3D movies look great.  The type of 3D this LG TV uses is called Passive 3D because the glasses are NOT battery operated and thus do not have a special LCD shutter.  This lowers the cost of the glasses, makes them lite weight.  Also this is the SAME type used in the theaters.  So you could go to a Movie theater, watch a 3D movie there and keep the glasses, after all you are paying extra for them so you could keep them.Another thing I recommend is turning off the energy saver, this tends to darken the screen too much, turning it off and setting the TV to \"Sport\" mode gives you the brightest screen and looks awesome.I had a 40\" Sony Bravia LCD that this TV replaced,  I am NOT sorry I did it.

To be precise the 3D effects are stunning compared to Active 3D models with heavy glasses. I had watched a full length 3D move by converting 2D to 3D with great effects and no head ache. The TV is very easy to set up and i had it up and running in 20 mins including the hardware setup of fixing the stand.I believe the great value is the built in USB player in the TV which supports multitude of file formats from USB flash drives or external hard disks. ( In fact it does more than a dedicated streaming player can do ). So for people who wants to get streaming player for watching movies saved in external HDD try it in TV first and then decide if you need to go for one. Regarding JPEG files the TV cannot play the  files which are saved in USB which are ~>5 MB. Not sure if it happens for everyone. Those are 18 MP files captured by Canon SLR in full resolution.Sound effects are pretty much low , but the volume is good enough for my living room . The quality of sound is good considering the fact that its a very slim LED TV.Regarding Voltage LG Claims in product page that its 100 - 240 V compatible with 50/60 Hz frequency. But the sticker in back of my TV says 120 V 50/60 Hz. I am a little worried only in this case since i wish i carry the TV with me to india.  Its the only reason i am giving 4 stars instead of 5 for misleading information from the manufacturer page and the Sticker with serial number in the back of the TV.Overall this is a very good TV compared to other models out there and to convert it to a smart TV you just need a streaming box like Roku or Sony N 100 which can be purchased for ~ 50 $ which is a better bargain rather than getting a smart TV of the same size for much higher price.

I replace my TVs every two years and purchased this for my master bedroom to replace a Sony Bravia XBR KDL-40XBR6.  The Sony was an excellent, but not perfect, TV, but I had already replaced my other TVs with LED backlit units and was especially anxious to replace the one in the MBR.  I already had a smart Sony Blu-Ray player, so I was not in need of that feature set.  If you are, you either need to keep shopping, upgrade the Blu-ray player or buy a Roku.Initially, I was just looking for a 42\" LED (which immediately ruled out Sony and Samsung) and had no great interest in 3D.  The more I saw of the technology, the more interested I was and went on a bit of a crash course to learn as much as I could.  I read customer reviews, expert reviews, visited manufacturer's websites and my local big box store.  I was initially conflicted by the competing claims of the active and passive camps...LG claiming 80% of the viewers preferred their technology and Sony claiming that passive technology resulted is a set with one half the resolution of an active set.While I love Sony (I currently have a 52\" Bravia in my living room, 3 of their Blu-ray players, 2 Sony DVD Recorders/VCRs and 2 Sony home theater systems), this is not the first time Sony has \"fudged\" on some of their numbers....outrageous contrast ratios immediately come to mind (they all twist the truth on that one...research \"dynamic contrast ratio\" to learn what they are doing with those numbers).  I am listing some of my equipment only to point out I am a genuine fan of Sony and certainly not a hater.Initially some of the expert reviews seemed to support the passive loss of resolution claims.  However as the passive sets became more available, more reviewers called this into doubt.  For those who didn't know, LG developed the passive technology and has licensed it to Vizio and Toshiba.  Some were suggesting they saw a difference, but not 1/2; others saying they saw no difference at all.There is a display device calibration software company named Displaymate.  Most importantly, they do NOT sell TVs, they sell the calibration software experts use to calibrate TVs and monitors.  I learned of them when I read that some of the best reviewers who actually calibrated and tested TVs made mention of using Displaymate software.  If you have any reservations about purchasing a passive 3D set, I wholeheartedly urge you to visit their site and READ...specifically the \"3D Display Technology Shootout\" article.Displaymate's conclusion after testing 3D TVs from Sony (active), Samsung (active), LG (passive) and Vizio (passive)?...\"Based on our extensive lab measurements and visual test comparisons between 3D TVs with FPR Passive Glasses versus 3D TVs with Active Shutter Glasses, we found that the Passive Glasses TVs delivered substantially and demonstrably better all around 3D imaging, 3D Contrast and sense of 3D depth, better 3D sharpness, better overall 3D picture quality, immersion and realism, and freedom from 3D ghosting, image Crosstalk, and flicker. This was true in all but a small number of situations, all of which we document in the sections mentioned above.\"I'm not suggesting you should accept any one person's or entity's position on this issue as the absolute truth, but this article made sense to me with real numbers and verifiable tests, some of which anyone can reproduce.The problem with the active camp's position is that it is attempting to apply 2D technology and testing methodology to 3D technology while essentially ignoring how the human brain processes and interprets 3D material.  Learn about 3D Image Fusion.In terms of the LG 42LW5300, as I indicated above, it is an excellent TV, especially for the money. It arrived in 2 days thanks to Amazon Prime in perfect condition.  My unit was manufactured in November 2011, so it was extremely fresh stock.  Set-up was quick and painless and I had it up and running in very short order.  I immediately upgraded the firmware (go to LG.com, type in the model number and click on \"support\".  I used the set's calibration menu and then played around with some of the numbers I had found in various review articles.  This is a work in progress.Based on everything I've read, I was fully expecting the LGs color reproduction to be excellent and to my eyes it is.  The most common criticism of the set was it's black level performance.  While I imagine if I had a Samsung or Sony (known for their black level performance) next to the LG I might see some difference, to my admittedly untrained eye, the LG's black performance was very good...black objects or scenes look appropriately black. I've never sensed the picture was lacking anything in that respect.I don't own a gaming system, so I can offer no opinion on its performance in that area.  Similarly, I have no plans to use the included Blu-ray player, a LG BD645, so I can't comment on it either.I didn't have any 3D Blu-ray movies so I purchased Cars 2 the same day I ordered the LG.  3D is where the the LG really shines...startling colors and effects.  I was thoroughly impressed.  Also, no headaches or other adverse reactions from the glasses, a definite plus. To fully appreciate this, you need to get a real 3D Blu-ray movie and not something you downloaded from the Internet. I certainly hope the 3D movies become more plentiful and affordable as I'm sure they will.The 2D to 3D conversion is OK.  It seems the effect with 2D Blu-ray movies is more dramatic than that with regular DVDs or TV programming, both of which remind of the 3D postcards they used to sell...a bit more depth, but certainly not true 3D.  Think of it as more of an enhancement.Also, if you have any concerns that the LG's 3D abilities adversely impacts its 2D performance, don't.  The 2D performance is excellent.  In fact, some reviewers have mentioned the 3D sets come with better electronics in order to support the 3D technology.  If you didn't press the 3D button on the remote you could never tell from a 2D picture that this was a 3D set.Nitpicks?  Another HDMI connection would have been nice (it has 3), a backlit remote control even nicer.  The controls on the lower right front corner of the TV itself are very hard to read in typical bedroom lighting which is not a huge issue as I suspect most people primarily use the remote. LG also really needs to come up with a way for the consumer to disable the 3D warning.  Also, as another reviewer noted, due to lip synch issues LG has deactivated AC3 decoding for the HDMI inputs.  That means the TV will only output stereo through the optical output for any signal that was input through a HDMI jack.  With my equipment this is not a major concern, for others it might be.One bit of information I couldn't find anywhere was about the sleep timer...it is programmable up to 240 minutes.  You have to go through the menu system to set it, there is no \"Sleep Timer\" button on the remote.  Since this is a bedroom TV, sleep timer stuff is of concern to me.  I like to fall asleep with the TV on, but if I forget to set the timer, I invariably wake up to the most genuinely horrible infomercials man has invented.  (Can you really have a four foot long creature growing in your colon and not know it?  I think not.)Do your own research and test drive as many TVs as you can, but I think this LG is an excellent set and at the price Amazon has recently been selling it for, $680, it is an incredible deal.It's a solid 4.5 stars TV which I bumped up to 5 based on the great value.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "So Far Great", "Author": "Quincy MA", "ReviewID": "R1IQRILZLLAG28", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "5 Star for a two day experience! We ordered it Sunday night and got it on Wednesday.Right aftrwards Amazon went to \"out of stock\". I would have hated to make a new decision or wait for stock to come in. I did an online chat with the LG support with a question about the remote and screen ratio and they were fast and friendly.  I haven't tried the real 3D yet and have to pick up some BluRay movies to try, I cannot review that yet.The stand is a little crooked - as if you gave the TV a little twist counter-clockwise. But no one knows this but me so not a problem. It also should include the HDMI cable for best hook up of the Blu Ray player, but I bought one separately.Tried the 2D to 3D simulation and it was awesome.  Didn't think it would be that impressive, but it really was. My \"significant other\" is a 3D artist and he is also thoroughly and positively impressed.I like the passive 3D feature - active 3D I did not see as a great feature - what with charging expensive glasses and don't like the idea of the \"shutter\" on glasses - it just sounds like it would give one a headache! I can't see that that will be an ongoing type of 3D television anyway.We are hooked to an antenna(our old one would have been fine, but purchased a flat one which is great because so unintrusive.) Don't understand why anyone would waste money on cable but I guess some people have that kind of money. The hook up was easy and pain/aggravation free. We have our old vcr/dvd recorder combo hooked up as well as the new Blu Ray player.Still a little rusty on the remote and all the options available but that will work itself out.I am not concerned with not having it wifi-ready, though we could easily connect it up later. I have a large screen computer in the same room so we can always watch and do stuff on there.We went to this from a good-old analog set with converter box and antenna - obviously I don't switch to new stuff everyday but, when I do, I do some research and get something that really is what I want!See how it goes since I have only had this for two days!", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV For Everything Except GAMING", "Author": "N. Banta", "ReviewID": "R1YVYXIP7GEFY0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I stumbled upon this TV recently and the deal just seemed to good to be true. I was so excited when it came in the mail as I have been using a 32inch LCD TV. I hooked it up and the picture was absolutely stunning. The 120hz really makes even 720p TV broadcasts simply amazing. The sound is not great at all but for the price it's worth the sacrifice for 3D. The 3D is as good or better than the 3D quality you get in the theaters.I watched a free 3D movie on Comcast On-Demand about surfing and it was the best experience I had ever seen. The water felt like it was splashing in your face when the movie showed people surfing. The picture was absolutely stunning. I experienced no ghosting or flickering. The 2D to 3D was really neat too but wasn't as big of deal to me. Everything seemed like a dream come true. I mean I was getting a technology most homes won't be getting for many years.This is where the bad news comes in. I tried 3D gaming since I had a copy of Call of Duty Black Ops for Xbox 360. The 3D was very cool but the gameplay had serious lag. After reading other reviews, I turned off trumotion and the lag improved but it still didn't feel right. I am sure the 3D was better on other games but I can only relate to my one game. The real bad news however is the 2D gameplay. I put in my copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and was excited to play on a bigger screen finally in 1080p (as my Phillips was only 720p). The picture was also amazing. The textures were so crisp and clear however playing modern warfare 3 was horrible. I kept dying when I would play multiplayer matches and the controls just felt very weird. I felt a serious delay from the time I would move my character until the character moved on the screen. I also played Need for Speed: The Run and I couldn't control my car as well as before on my other TV. I started thinking that maybe it was just a bigger TV and it was something I had to get used to.So I started looking everywhere from forums, youtube and reviews from other sites. I could not find an answer as to why I was experiencing this. I found LG's customer support number and called them. After the agent researched for me she found out that this TV is not meant for gaming as the response time is 7msec.I am submitting this review not to say this TV is horrible because it is a great TV. Everything about it is simply amazing. I am writing this review to document my experience so other gamers who stumble across this TV will be warned. If you love fast action games like racing or first person shooters (there may be more genres but I am only naming the ones I experienced) I would not get this TV. For fast paced gaming you need a TV that has a response time from 0-4msec. Anything higher could result in lag and you will become very frustrated.If you are not a gamer or if you are gamer but don't play any fast paced games than this TV is perfect for you. 3D movies are spectacular. This TV has the best picture I have seen so far (there may others better but I am only telling from my experience). Bottom line: If you want a 3D experience and don't play games or don't play fast paced games then, GET THIS TV! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!Do not get this TV if you love FPS titles especially. If you absolutely want this TV and are a hardcore FPS gamer than you will just have to adjust and try to think ahead otherwise you will be frustrated due to the delay. I am giving this 3 stars because of the simple fact that I got this TV mainly for gaming and this TV did live up to my expectations.For now, I am going to have to bypass 3D TV's mainly because I can't afford anything over 1,000 but I am sure in a couple of years the price will go down and 3D TV's will be more eligible for gamers like me.

I'm happy this uses the same kind of glasses you'd get from the theater, and don't cost a ton to replace.the speakers are pretty weak, a symptom I'm finding increasingly common among TVs nowadays. Another issue I have is this only have optical out if you want to use a stereo/sound bar setup.The other problem is consooe gaming. My PS3 is also my primary DVD/bluray/game machine so having to switch \"input labels\" to get the lag to go away while gamimg is a pain in the butt, especially when I have an actual PC hooked to the TV already it can make the inputs get a bit confusing.In ,my opinion, the cons are far outweighed by the pros in this unit.

If you watch this at the proper distance, the quality IMO is just as good as the active shutter systems. Many people are also saying its not true 1080p and then say the active shutter is better because of that. now for a little bit of math...  we will use the following,full HD movie - 1080p * 2(eyes) = 2160.  that is a standard moviePassive 3d - 540 per eye = 1080p total --- yes its 1/2active shutter- 1080p * 2(eyes) =2160 ...  / 2  cause it shutters your view creating a visual flicker..  == 1080p totalso you now have true hi-def at 2160  active shutter is 1080p cause it is flittering between eyes  and passive at 1080p cause the view field is shuttered..(though you really cant tell putting the glasses on-just looks like your wearing sunglasses)so active shutter and passive are going to be the same resolution whether anyone wants to really admit it.difference is now the passive does not have that annoying flicker nor does it have the uncomfortable feeling to wear.The TV itself has a great picture, I have noticed however the blue-ray player has a little to be desired as what is played from it seems dark. I hooked up my other player again and the picture was quite a bit brighter. but it wasn't at a point I even noticed after a few minutes anyway.The glasses are a cheesy orange and white - ill prolly grab some from the theater next week. This part is in NO way anything to blame the company (***5 stars for their shipping***) but I really wish they did not use UPS.To put it simple, the delivery was for today. UPS had it in town this morning and it (along with another package from newegg) went out for delivery. I right away told the family \"watch---its a big item--something will happen with the delivery\". About 1:30 I see the UPS truck pull up front. Im thinking---wow I was wrong.  The driver gets out of the seat and she goes in the back of the truck for a minute. Then she comes back up front, sits down and drives away. Im immediately watching the status on UPS--I thought maybe they had to make another delivery and come back. After about 30 minutes, the status on UPS updated and said \"A CORRECT COMPANY OR RECEIVER NAME IS NEEDED FOR DELIVERY. UPS IS ATTEMPTING TO OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION[X]\"ok...this appeared for BOTH packages, and I have ordered quite a bit from both companies to know they have the right address. I immediately contacted UPS via live chat. She confirmed MY address on the chat and then said she would have them call me by the end of the day.  I wasn't waiting to end of day or it would be all weekend waiting. I called the local office and talked to them. They called the driver and made her come back. She got here and claimed they had the wrong address and handed me first the small box. I pushed it in her face (sort of) and said--- the address is right here...she was a bit embarrassed and it was obviously the fact she didn't want to handle the big package.

I could never be satisfied until see the pictures on this TV!!! Amazing technology to watch your 3D movies made by your 3D camera! Everything is perfect and now I am fully satisfied with my 3D camera because of that.The passive technology is cheaper (two pairs of 3D glasses costs only 10 dolars while the active ones can reach more than 100 dolars)and have small differences in terms of depth and picture color. My 3D active device handles better the colors (more brilliant) and I can stay watching the movies without feeling sickness after 40 minutes. With this LG I can't stay too long, because of the passive technology I think. But the picture quality is really nice and I can see perfectly my pictures taken from my camera.So, It is perfect for someone that wants to see its 3D pictures and watch small videos in 3D.Beside the 3D aspect, you will be very sactisfied with all the rest!

Finally i got it the following thursday.  so took 11 days to receive.Unpacking and setupThis combo comes in one big box, fun for the cat to play in.  It was well padded inside a bigger box.  unpacking was easy.  Setup wasnt very difficult.  simple stand setup instructions.  plugged everything in within 15 minutes with HDMIBlu ray player.  This model has an optical out and an HDMI out.  This means that if you dont have a 3D receiver, you can hook the HDMI directly to your TV, and connect the optical to your receiver.  that way you can have sound through your sound system and still watch things in 3D.  I read that optical wont give you dolby tru sound, but not worried about it as it will still carry at least 5.1 digital sound.LED LCD TVThe TV is truly amazing.  It uses the same 3d tech as movie theaters(circular polarized) so no huge clunky glasses with batteries.  It has nice picture and color.  It has the Tru motion feature (aka screen interpolation), that is that feature that makes movies your watching in department stores kinda \"flow\" or almost slow down so things are more clear and less blurry.  you can turn the option off but i kind of like it.  It gives movies a kind of surreal flow and allows for a better picture.Also the TV is super thin and weighs little to nothing.  Energy cost is like $13 per year on the energy star label.Finally it has 3d options to watch all sorts of 3D movies and 3D games.  Works with COD black ops just fine.  and it even has a feature that allows 2D movies to be played as 3D.  The effect isnt as startling as a movie made for 3D, but it does give it depth and makes blu ray movies like Avatar and speed racer more fun to watch.  Hell, even my Babylon 5 DVDs were interesting to watch with this feature!Lastly there is a new technology simplink, where the TV and blu ray player can sense when each are turned on.  This means when you turn on/off the blu ray player, the TV turns itself on/off accordingly.  It even turns my receiver off for me when i turn off the blu ray.  Its pretty cool.  and if you have more than your receiver plugged into the back of the TV, the TV will try and change its input to go display it.  neat feature although it sometimes gets confused when two things are on.Bad stuff:  Really the only bad thing is that there is no manuals or instructions to help guide you through all this.  So if this is your first big multimedia system, you will need to study up on HDMI, receivers if you have one, and 3d pass through and support for your HDMI connections.  There are still many features on the remotes (yes each device has its own remote, no universal) that i havent figured out yet.Overall:  Overall, its an insane upgrade.  I never thought i would be able to afford a 3D setup but this LG package is affordable (at least on black friday weekend hehe).  Vanns did a decent job, dont know about the squaretrade warranty yet.

I have yet to try the 3d blu-ray yet but that is only due to the fact you cannot rent them anywhere yet and they are expensive to buy.  I have played Xbox 360 on it and there was no lag. The 3D on games like Halo Anniversary and Gears of War 3 are simply amazing. I noticed no lag playing in 3D and was blown away by the picture and graphics. I run Direct TV and the picture is wonderful. For the price you cant go wrong. The 2D-3D conversion is pretty cool, it makes the picture seem deeper however nothing comes out of the screen in this mode. The glasses are lightweight and once you get into the movie or game you are watching/playing you don't really notice them. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get into 3D without spending $1000 or more.

Then most important thing (which I should have checked before ordering) is that it does not do any streaming (Netflix, youtube, etc.) This i felt would be minor since i already have a 2D blu-ray player which does all that. Problem is now I have two blue-ray players and have to do wiring for both.

In daylight, it can be seen perfect, and well, at night, it's stunning!  The edge light dimming is a great option and makes the blacks darker and while the 120hz is nice, the Tru-motion can be set on off, low or high.  I'm not a fan of this feature during movies, but for live events (football, soccer, etc.) it makes the picture clear and assists in rendering that perfect image.  The 3D Blu-ray combo is another great add-on, since you need a 3d blu-ray player to watch movies in 3D.

I've had it only about a month; but my first impressions are quite positive.  For starters, the quality of the picture, especially in HD, is truly outstanding - an order of magnitude better than the flat screen that it replaced.  The technology has obviously improved - a lot.  And this with virtually no tweaking of the settings.To demonstrate the 3D, I bought a few 3D \"kid's movie\" DVD's that got some usage by the grandkids over the holidays.  They liked it.  I, on the other hand, am reserving judgement until I see its use on a few movies made for adults. However, I anticipate that, for me, it may be a novelty that will ware off.  The BluRay 3D player that came bundled with the TV, does the job. It is devoid of all \"bells & whistles\" - a bare bones device - but one that meets my needs.  And if you want to play 3D movies you will need a BluRay 3D player. By-the-way, 3D DVD's are expensive, especially if you buy them locally.  Amazon seems to have the lowest prices at the moment and their selection is good.  This LG uses the form of 3D that requires \"passive\" glasses for viewing.  Four come included in the bundle and I bought eight more. (I'm blessed with many grandchildren.)  They work well - no complaints from users.  I have no experience with systems that require \"active\" glasses, so I cannot make comparisons - except in price.  The passive glasses can be obtained from Amazon for as little as about $3.00, while the active glasses cost from $60 to $150. This is a price point that would make a 3D TV not feasible for my needs.A nice surprise is the TV's capability to convert 2D to 3D.  I was aware, of course, that this is a feature of the LG; but what surprised me is how effective it can be for some programs.  In particular, sports programs in HD - football games, hockey, etc. - look as if they are being broadcast in 3D.  This has turned out to be a no cost plus that was unanticipated and has significantly added to my satisfaction, so far, with this LG TV.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bang for the Buck", "Author": "David Le", "ReviewID": "R32HZ1FM52RJ0N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this after Black Friday Weekend because I was looking for a 3D TV and saw that this one has good price.

Now, I do set it up to the way I want it so you need to do what's good for you.  There are a few recommendation settings out there.

Hedgepeth", "ReviewID": "R33GSD17CA5FX2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the 47\".I love this TV. It is magnificent. The 3d is amazing.The 2d to 3d conversion is good, but not as nice as a real 3d Blu-ray. It seems that the higher the quality of the video that you are watching, the better the conversion. For instant, if I try to convert an old TV show that I am watching on Netflix, there is virtually no 3d because the resolution is too low to tell, but if you're worried that it might reduce the picture quality, don't be. Even in the worst of conversions, the video's quality does not dwindle. It looks just as good as without it (for the most part). So, the deciding factor of whether or not to convert something is really whether or not the level of 3d is worth the effort of having to wear the glasses.The glasses aren't much of a problem. I often forget that I am wearing them, although having to watch the television in the right position is annoying. When you tilt your head to the side there is a very slight tint of purple. The glasses don't cause me irritation. However, when I first started watching the television, particularly a 2d to 3d converted video game, it was a little irritating for a short while, but it went away and hasn't been a problem since my first \"session.\" Lighting is also not an issue. The screen is bright and the glasses do not take away from the picture... most of the time.I have noticed that when playing 3d games that are already 3d (not converted by the television) that there is a noticeable difference in picture in the left and right eye of the glasses while I'm going through really dark areas. In bright light, or even not so bright light, everything is fine. I compared the right and left eyes. In very dark scenes, the left eye shows picture with some darkness, while the right eye shows a picture that is nearly COMPLETELY black. The contrast is VERY distracting. What's annoying is that there is virtually no difference brightness when its not a very dark scene. I haven't had the issue with the games that I have played with 2d to 3d conversion, nor with 3d movies (converted 3d and real 3d).The two games I've noticed it in are Uncharted 3, and Resistance 3. Uncharted has amazing 3d and graphic (and story!) and makes this TV all the more enjoyable. I just don't understand why it's like that--it doesn't happen when I am watching 3d Blu-rays, which I should add the 3d is amazing with those as well. Although, I have found it more of a problem since I have noticed it because I cannot help but think about it. Still, I should add that I had a friend try it out and they did not say there was a problem, so it may just be my eyes.I don't think it's a fault of LG, because its not the same for anything else. I just try to ignore it--like I said its only in the really dark parts.There has been talk of a lag in gaming.Someone said it was an imput lag. I haven't experience this lag, with or without 3d (both converted and stereoscopic).Here is what they said:1. On your remote, press the input button.2. Then push the blue button on the bottom right hand corner of the remote. It says 3D settings but that's irrelevant right now.3. This will open a window to change the name of the input.4. Choose the PC name.I have tried (in MW3) it with HD, Game, and PC as the input name, but they all seem to be the same. I think they said they had an Xbox though, and I have a PS3. I think that may be what is causing the problem because when I changed the input settings to PC it causes the screen to blink (something that does not happen when changing to other input settings, which they tried gaming but it did not work), so it implies that the PC setting might activate different settings from the other functions.All in all, it's a keeper! It's an amazing TV, and beautifully designed. It isn't a SMART TV, but its designed for quality and a lower price range. So the lower price puts it in a different rating scale (in my opinion) than SMART TV's.So my rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars!PS: I don't use the TV's sound system, so I am not really qualified to judge it. Also, I paid $799 (47\"), and I would never pay much more than $900 (assuming I had that type of money). So take that into account when considering what I said about the lower price range.

At first I thought I was crazy, but it was one of those things that once you noticed it, it started bugging you.  Eventually I called up LG and managed to convince a tech that there was a problem (took awhile though!).  They did do a very good job of sending someone over with a new panel to replace it, a pretty painless procedure.  The person who replaced it really couldn't even see the problem and thought I was nuts, but the panel replacement did fix the issue.  Anyway, my point is, make sure you scrutinize the picture in both 3D and non-3D mode.. my problem, like I said, only affected the right side and could have easily been missed... no signs of damage to the box or set, so I am thinking it might be a manufacturing problem?Update 8/2013: My repaired TV is still great, though one other niggle I wanted to mention is I recently discovered the SPDIF audio out on the set is 2-channel audio only, not 5.1 as you might expect.

I use Panasonic BT310 3D Blu-ray player Panasonic DMP-BDT310 Integrated-Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player in addition to the stock LG BD-645 3D Blu-Ray player, and the thin black lines are almost indistinguishable unless you consciously, purposefully pick them. For the TV itself, W5300 is the best value for those who don't need the Smart TV feature, as it includes Local Dimming feature also.Overall, recommending Passive 3D over Active 3D; and recommending W5300 as the best value. If you have the money, go with the W6500; in between would be the W5600 and W5700.

Just press the 3D button on the TV remote and.....Voila! I am watching the Dark Knight in 3D, which Christopher Nolan did not intend to make. The converted 3D is decently entertaining, although admittedly it is not as capturing as if the movie had been shot at native 3D. I don't know how LG did it but this is simply AMAZING.

And that's where the excitement turned to utter disappointment for our family.  We had to get to Christmas Morning service so I just told him that I would call Amazon once we got home.  For me I couldn't wait.  I had to get an answer and figure out a way to make things right for my son's Christmas...I did the call back feature for returns and to my amazement I received a call back within 30 secs.  I was immediately talking one on one with a Customer Service Rep.  I explained the missing screws for the base mount and the representative gave me option #1.  I will need to return the TV \"free of charge\" and once they process the return Amazon would next day air the replacement to me \"free of charge\".  I was pretty calm and politely said No this is not a good enough option.  I made it clear that this was my son's only Christmas present and I was not going to want him to wait a week to get a TV that he should have been using today.  I also reminded him that they (amazon) should first compensate for my son for dealing with a broken present.  The Rep understood and put me on hold.Option 2 was way better than the first one..  The Rep came back on the phone and said that they were going to send the new product out to me tomorrow and next day air it with a Tuesday delivery and I would still return the TV.  Plus he said that they would also authorize a credit of XX amount for my son to spend on something else at Amazon.  Very Generous offer and I agreed.The rep had me on the phone for another 15 mins but came back and said that he could not process Option #2.  He than said he's now authorize to pay for the missing screws.  He asked me what were the screws worth to me?  I was a little annoyed but I came back to him with a response that was more intended to saying \"your crazy if your going to have me find screw replacement.\"  I was expecting the Service Rep to flinch and say \"no I can't do that\" but instead he said no problem if your ok with that number I understand and gave me that much in refund plus the credit of XX for my son.After everything was processed I hung up the phone and explained to my son what had transpired.  I told him that I was not going to keep that credit from amazon and we would either find him a new base, buy new screws, or get something else that would go with the TV.  My son felt good about everything and forgot about the fact he was not able to use the TV immediately.

I guess this is how the passive 3D glasses technology works and I am happy with it, especially considering the low buy-in cost.I have a PlayStation 3 and tried using Gran Turismo 5 game in 3D mode - here, the drop in resolution is pretty obvious - essentially half as much resolution as 2D mode. This is probably more due to how the game renders 3D than a fault of the television, because for HD video, the difference in quality much less perceptible.I bought the TV for dual use as a video playback console and as an oversized computer monitor. While it does great as a television, it is a little less desirable as a computer monitor. Even after spending hours calibrating the display, the greens and blues look too bright and over-saturated. Everything looks perfect as part of an integrated image (video/photos displayed via the computer), but isolated text that is in all green or blue does not look like it does on my laptop computer's internal display. (I have a Samsung LCD TV and it looks fine on that TV even without a lot of calibration, so it has something to do with the display.

There are two issues with it:1) Connections - The dvd player does not have any component connections. Granted, it has RCA & HDMI jacks, but why should it not include component as well? I, as the end user, should not have limited options for connecting the system to my equipment (in this case a Onkyo receiver with only component jacks). It seems like the \"bundle\" works great together, but if you attempt to integrate it into a home theater environment, you're connection options are limited. It just smacks of \"get them to buy the nice (supposedly hi-end) bundle, and slip them as lo-end dvd player as we can get away with.

I believe the product I received was defective. The contrast/blacks were terrible. This was to replace a 46inch Sony Bravia, and this unit was like a bad laptop monito no matter what setting or mode I put it into. Setting the screen to a mostly black background there was lots of blobby bright spots, and a lot of light in the upper left side of the screen.2. I had no problems with games on pc or ps3 in regards to input lag (I followed the instructions of setting the input label to PC).3. Activating the 3d DOES reduce the screen resolution by half. Essentially the glasses polarize every other line (vertically). The 3d does work, but because I'm using this for a monitor, and it's only a couple feet from me, the resolution drop looks hideous. For the most part in a living room where you are 10-15 feet from the tv it probably wouldn't be that bad. The truth is the average human eye can't distinguish 1080p from 720p on most tvs below 50 inches at 6-10 feet or so.On ps3 games which are already less than 1080p, usually, look pretty bad. Text is difficult to read.4. The 2d-3d works surprisingly well. Gimmicky but effective at guessing, or creating an illusion maybe that the brain corrects into believable 3d.After playing around with it I decided that even if the screen was not defective the 3d at lower resolution was simple not that exciting(especially for how close I as going to be and the size of the tv), and was not a good replacement for my Bravia.

Has a really good picture and the 2D to 3D conversion works fairly well, but the digital tuner has problems.  It is missing a number of digital channels and I do not know why.  There are two other HDTVs in the house that receive the digital channels over the cable system, so I know that it is just this TV that is having the problem.  Does not appear to be any problem with its analog tuner as it receives the same channels as the other TVs.I cannot say that I care for the way the tuner is set up either.  There needs to be some way to just scan for either cable channels or over the air channels.  As it is, it scans for 2-13 TV channels, over the air digital channels, cable digital channels, and cable analog channels.  That is time consuming, it duplicates channels, and I would prefer the analog and digital channels be together rather than being isolated in their own sections.  The cable system in my small town only has a limited number of digital channels.  The 37\" Vizio HDTV in the house keeps all the digital and analog channels together.  It is easy to delete the analog channels where they are duplicates of the digital channels.  As one goes up or down the TV channels, one does not need to visit the analog channel where there is a digital version.Nov. 23 ***************I have raised my one star rating to four stars.  I have had this TV for several days now and have been trying to determine why the HD channels are missing.  Was not the TVs's fault.  Called the cable company and got one of its techs to come by and test the line signal.  The line signal coming into the house is far below what it should be, so that is why the TV is not detecting them.  The tech said he would be back after Thanksgiving day and fix that problem.I have been watching several DVDs, Blu-rays, and TV programs with the TV's 2D>3D conversion switched on.  It is not perfect but it is rather neat.  This TV has a really good picture but I still like the tuner setup on my 37\" Vizio.Nov. 29 *******************TV Cable repairmen came today and increased the cable line signal into the house.  Sad to say their handiwork did not solve the case of the missing digital channels, as I had hoped.  Apparently, I received a faulty TV.  I mostly liked this TV.  The way the tuner is set up is my only negative concerning the way the TV is set up.  I am going to leave my rating at 4 stars even though the TV tuner is faulty.  As many TVs as are made today, there are occasionally going to be ones made that are broke.  Such is life.Dec. 1 *********************I returned the faulty TV and placed an order for another one.  I filled out Amazon's online return form on Dec. 1st and UPS was here on Dec. 2nd  with prepaid return sticker to pick up the TV.  So far no hassle whatsoever to return.Dec. 15 ********************I received a new TV and have been watching it for a number of days.  The first TV was not faulty (sorry Amazon).  Apparently, at least this model of LG TVs has a compatibility issue with the way the digital channels are programmed on my cable system.  It refuses to pickup a number of digital channels with which two other digital TVs have no problem.  I have debated with myself whether or not to return this one also and go buy a 42 inch Vizio 3D TV bundle at Walmart, but after having watched Avatar 3D I decided to keep this one, as I don't want to downsize the TV screen.  Avatar 3D on this 47\" is amazing.  Absolutely beautiful and stunning picture!  Wish I could have afforded the 55\" of this model and then had a place to set it.  With 3D, I think bigger is better as far as the screen size is concerned.  This 47\" displays an excellent picture.

Dad", "ReviewID": "R1Y3TQFG4UFUE7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Final update:Bought the TV... My family was very happy with it.  I was not happy at all, since I do not watch TV but opt for video games.Lets say that I originally went down this path because my game went to crap two nights in a row.  Now, I am no ace, but I have a steady pattern and know my game play.  The only thing after checking my Internets and such was my new TV.  There had to be some input lag.  I did the quick test with the human bench mark and noticed that I was not getting a good response time.  But that was different... it was human.  I now had to know.  So I then measured it with a Canon 60D, HDMI out a mini displayport from a 15inch MBP  and a web timer : Sure enough, 130ms lag time.  I could not believe that it was that bad.  LG and TV manufactures should absolutely measure this and give these details in the specs.  But they don't.  It is coming though.I went down the road with LG.  Did not expect much but wanted to try.  Installed the new firmware 5.00.001 (I was moving from 3.00.00).  Hoped that there was something with two major revisions. Maybe they over looked something and forgot to turn off processing for the game mode.Ended up buying a cheaper model (47LV4400) and is it around 20ms (maybe even less).  That is doable and my game is back to where it was.  My guess was that there is something up with the 3D that is causing that input lag.  Even though 3D is off and input was set to game mode.To lower the 130ms input lag, you need to get to the correct settings.The following steps are the only way to drop the input lag on the TV.  I originally tested (all labels and settings) for the input lag.  At least this is what I thought at the time.  This led me to return my TV.  Turns out the current instructions are, at best, leading people to a 1 out of 3 chance at actually improving lag. It can be improved to about a 50ms input lag. Three frames on a 60frames per second game (MW3).  BF3 is 30 frames per second (2 or 1 frame behind, depending on the sequencing).  I will let others judge on if that is good enough for them.  I have not heard of better than 10ms so this TV is \"ok\" for games. My tests on the 47LV4400 revealed 20ms lag for it.  That TV is better than this TV for games.  This is a better TV for everything else.  People will have to decide on what balance works for themselves.  It really is on how you can handle the lag and compensate which is an individual thing.The instructions to reduce the input lag, are as follows:1) Plug you gaming system into HDMI3. NOTE: Do not uses HDMI 1 or 2 for this model of TV.  Tested with firmware 5.00.012) Set the current port to HDMI3.  Do this so that you can see your xbox,ps3 signal.3) Press the input button on the remote.4) Press the blue button on the remote.5) For the HDMI3 label, scroll through the following list and chose \"PC\".HD-DVD > Blu-Ray > blank > VCR > DVD > Set Top Box > Satellite > Cable Box > Game > PCThings to be aware of, so that you know that your input lag has been reduced:When you select PC, the screen will go blank and reacquire the signal.  It is at this point that you know you are good to go and post processing is at its lowest (hopefully no post processing is occurring but is not the case).  If you do the same on HDMI1-2 ports, the reacquisition of the signal will not occur.  You could always test for the lag.All in all, I like this TV for a TV - I give it 4 stars for that department.  But this review is dealing with gaming and that should partly focus on the lag.. I have now had some real time with this TV and 50ms input lag for gaming is not good enough.  Yes, better than 120 but not there and do not think of playing games in 3D.I hope that people find this review, which may be using the incorrect HDMI ports that do not improve inputlag.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "good tv", "Author": "hey!", "ReviewID": "R1LKWKEKC2NL98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a good basic 3d tv I really didn't expect much the picture is ok it could be better but the motion rate is very good in my opinion I would reccomend this tv for anyone who is looking for a basic 3d tv", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Apps won't work", "Author": "Prozach2", "ReviewID": "R7SEFY3CL8EM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV in October along with a LG 3D Blu Ray.

He was using his own internet, router, etc. and he still could not get the TV or the Blu Ray to work.  I contacted the retail store and tried to return it, and they said my 30 day warranty was up.

His advice to me was, \"don't ever buy LG.\"  He gave me some technical jargon about an issue with their bandwidth which I won't pretend to understand, but this is apparently a common issue with their products.

I got this tv to replace a Vizio M3D421SR, which suffered from a bad led bleeding problem, because of all the great reviews it has received. I turned the tv on and immediately noticed the picture quality was terrible. I thought, I will put in my calibration blu ray and see the results then. To my disappointment, during calibration, this tv could never achieve proper black or white levels. I turned all settings that could possibly interfere with this process off, and still the contrast(black and white levels) was terrible. Even if that were okay, the sharpness and the overall clarity of this tv was terrible, especially on standard def material. Since alot of tv(cable or satelite) is still broadcast in standard def, this is a huge issue. The so called \"experts\" also give this tv great reviews. I don't know if people think that because the experts rate it high it must be good or if they just don't have anything else to compare it to. The picture quality of this tv is just not up to par, in my opinion , with other tvs that are available at the same price point. I have since replaced both(LG & Vizio) with the Toshiba 42TL515U, which I picked up on amazon for $699. The picture quality is amazing and black and white levels were easily achieved. I would highly recommend avoiding the LG tv . The Toshiba is a much better tv all the way around. I would even recommend the Vizio over the LG.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "not a smart tv", "Author": "just  me", "ReviewID": "R2D68KE84NGKSY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I thought this was a smart TV.
