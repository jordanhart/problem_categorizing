{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wonderful, enjoyable TV that does its job and impresses along the way", "Author": "Golden Retriever \"Matt\"", "ReviewID": "R2B97K9WU3SY47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is huge and has great picture quality, and watching it is the perfect way to end the day.  It hooks up easily with my DVD player and my laptop, does exactly what it's supposed to do, is intuitive to use, and has never caused me any trouble.I read the other reviews complaining about workmanship, but my TV is almost 4 years old and has had zero problems (even bulb failures).  That's even more impressive since I shipped it 3,000 miles across the country when moving and am sure it was jostled.Things to note: the TV looks best when the overhead lights are dim, and it takes 10-15 seconds to turn on (which seems slow).  Also, the sound quality is not the best available.  However, I still give the TV 5 stars because these problems are minor and addressable, because I have a separate sound system, and because overall the TV has exceeded my expectations and was a great value for the price I paid.One last point: Visitors are extremely impressed with this TV, because it looks sexy and expensive.  If you a modest person, this TV could come across as more ostentatious than its smaller cousins.  However, if you like the attention, the style points, and a fantastic viewing experience, this TV is for you.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Mitsubishi W-52327 review", "Author": "Xavier Sepeda \"xs\"", "ReviewID": "R1G09OJQF4XJQY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first big screen HDTV. Initially I was excited about the prospect of having a big screen high definition tv. I paid my satellite company for the HD channels and HD receiver.  The fact is from the variety of different HD channels, only a limited few are of any interest, for me at least. So I canceled the HD channels and now have the basic lineup. But since I still have the HD receiver I do get all local channels that program in HD. Which amounts to major broadcast stations primetime and news programs. Back to my review for the tv. I've had it for two years now and the picture shows great, I also bought the stand and it looks very contemporary. In two years I've had the bulb changed twice (first time 14 mos. and the next 8 mos.). So figure about once every year, give or take useage. And the bulb costs $169.00. I paid for a 5 year $329.00 extended warranty, so luckily it's been covered. But after that I'm on my own. Unfortunately the tv speakers don't work with my satellite, only the surround sound system is connected. It's not been a big deal. So all in all for my first HD tv the 52\" size and the picture is what impressed me. My next tv I'll have to research a little harder and find one that doesn't burn through the bulbs so fast.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY MITSUBISHI DLP!", "Author": "L. Klein", "ReviewID": "R89F4AU0HHNKB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We had a second generation model (WD-52725) of this TV purchased in 12/04. We just loaded it up to take to the dump. In the <5 years we owned it, we replaced the bulb twice with after-market bulbs we got on the internet, and finally paid a TV repairman $100 to tell us that it would cost $700 to send the entire main unit (a large part that can be taken out) back to Mitsubishi to be repaired, after which there is only a 6-month warranty on the repair. We figured that was about what we paid for our new Sony LCD, which if it lasts as long as the Mitsubishi did, is still a better deal. The repairman told us that DLPs are on their way out, and while LCDs have their problems also, they don't have the maintenance of the DLP. He told us that in order to get the bulb to last more than 1.5 years, we would need a brand name Mitsubishi bulb, which after 5 years still costs $275. The original bulb lasted us 2.5 years. The next after-market one lasted only 1.5 years. DLPs are also very loud when they run, and take a full minute or more to \"warm up\" and get a picture. Not so with the LCD. Go Mitsubishi if you want, but expect a money pit and a very LARGE pain to haul away.", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Outdated TV", "Author": "Fred", "ReviewID": "R2RVOQ2H1BXY0K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Mitsubishi makes good TVs but this one is old. I have 2 purchased 6 years ago and served me well. OK if you found a new one very cheap and could live with it - i.e. around $300 NEW. Picture and sound quality is good but design is very outdated - 4 stars 6 years ago 1 star now. This is an old chunky DLP analog TV and won't receive standard digital broadcast without a conversion box. Very slow turn on and turn off. Off course, not really high def either, 720p only. I have replaced lamps on both of them and one is dead now.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Mitsubishi 1280x720p Proprietary DLP Light Engine\n480-Line Motion-Adaptive 3D Y/C Comb Filter\nDVI - Digital Visual Interface\n3 Component Video Inputs\n5-Inch Coaxial Speakers", "Name": "Mitsubishi WD52327 52 Inch DLP Rear Projection HDTV Ready", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A6F11ZVXL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0007D4SV2"}}
