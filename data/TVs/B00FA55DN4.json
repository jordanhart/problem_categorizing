Worst tv I have ever owned, lasted 5 months and panel burned out showing black lines through the picture. Pixelated like crazy with motion in screen. Sent the tv back to hisense and they did not even acknowledge they received it, I had to call them to verify, and to get them to repair it. Then, waited 3 weeks and decided to call again since it was taking longer than expected to receive the \"repaired\" tv and they informed me that the reason for the delay was because they received 30 panels from china all broken during shipping! So after about a month, I finally received the tv and took it out of the box, plugged it in only to find out that this one was defective on arrival, even took pics and video of it for evidence, put it right back in the box and called ups to turn around and ship it right back. Then I had to call their hisense support center and asked for a manager, I ended up speaking to a very rude person in escalations demanding a refund. He refused to issue me one saying that it is their policy that the tv must be sent in 3 times before a refund is issued, I was furious and spoke to the head manager which approved of my refund. And after waiting 3 weeks more I have not heard from them so I had to call them again to notify them that they had received my tv, and they finally submitted my refund paperwork to their finance dept. It has been about a month since then and I still haven't received my refund but I have confirmed with the escalations dept that the paperwork was cleared and I should receive my check within the week. Not to mention having to force my way to obtain the status of my check. DO NOT EVER BUY HISENSE PRODUCTS YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!

Up until January of 2013, I had a rear projection monster that supposedly did 1080i, but it was actually upscaled from 525 or something like that.  The picture was fuzzy, and steadily degraded over the 7 years I owned it.I bought the Hisense knowing it's a cheap Chinese manufacturer.  The cost was too low to pass up.. I picked it up at Walmart for $500.The colors did need calibrating, but that took only about 20 minutes.  After that, it's been a year of pure viewing delight.  The 120hz refresh rate really makes the screen pop.  I have friends tell me that it's too life-like.  The only issue I've ever had was when the remote died.  A call to Hisense had a new remote sent to me via 2-day express.Are they as good as Vizio or Samsung?  Probably not.  But they're also not as expensive and the image quality seems to be every bit as good as the big manufacturers.  I consider myself happy with my purchase and look forward to years of service from it.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Defective Panels on these and Hisense does not honor warranty", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R2RLJB9D1D6Q13", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been in a running dispute with Hisense over this for 5 months now.  They refuse to honor their on site warranty and have blatantly lied to me. My dispute was escalated to a manager named Quasharwn that assured me they did not have panel failure problems on this product.  That contradicted what I was told by two other employees that acknowledged they were having Mass Panel Failures and they told me the the company would not repair the TV On-Site despite the on site servicer wanting to perform the repair as spelled out in my warranty.Just to give you an idea of what type of company this is their -----BBB RATING IS AN F-----!!!!!
