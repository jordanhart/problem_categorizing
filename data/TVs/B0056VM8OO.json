{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great, Straightfoward TV", "Author": "A. N. O'Nemus", "ReviewID": "R5L8W8R37J12M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a 42\" Sony Grand Wega which had developed the dreaded \"blue optical block\" issue.  Having been ripped off once I wasn't about to give Sony any more money (they knew it was a fault when they sold these sets, but didn't do a recall - and our TV failed just too late to benefit from the resulting class action).  So, I spent weeks online and in stores looking for anew set that would be good quality, and not loaded with junk I don't need or want (endless expensive paid streaming sources, Skype stuff, not ready for prime time 3D, etc) that it was a real relief to come across this one! It's great!When you first set it up, the picture can be disappointing (I guess it depends what you watch and how picky you are), but if you're willing to spend some time experimenting with the various settings, of which there are many, you can soon have it as you want it.  This set's picture quality is far better than my Sony (which I liked).  There may be better modern sets for picture quality out there, but I didn't see any at BestBuy, Walmart, etc - and I'm willing to bet nothing this size has a picture near this good for the $549 this set cost me (I bought it from Amazon, not from Paul's TV).The remote is adequate, and easy enough to use - and there's a USB port to connect a flash drive or external hard drive for media transfer/storage (the manual - which isn't very ggod - doesn't say a hard drive will work, but it will, I've done it). Be sure if you want to use a hard drive that it's in a housing with a switch - the TV can't power on an external drive the way a PC can!.  This makes it easy to watch .avi, divx etc, or to play music (it also has a connection for mp3 players).  Shoving a hard drive you already own into a cheap switched housing will give you a lot of digital media storage, all of which is than readily available through the TV (and your audio system if you like).  Its interface for this feature is pretty good, too.Another very nice feature is that if you use it to play audio, there's a button on the remote that shuts down the screen but leaves the sound on (and the screen comes back up with the touch of any button).  This is great for music.  The sound is exceptionally good better than any TV I've ever heard (don't be put off by any reviewer saying otherwise).I hooked mine up to our audio system (two very good speakers, so stereo, not surround sound).  When watching movies, by having the TV sound on as well, but at a lower level than the two main speakers, it boosts the sound, making it fuller, so it helps (some TVs only let you have their sound if you're not running through an audio system). We don't want surround sound, but this extra fullness for movies is nice, and doesn't interfere with music (I never went to a concert where I stood or sat in the middle and the band stood all around the edges of the hall!).And the best feature by miles?  No irritating \"apps\", no pointless 3D, \"just the facts, ma'am\"!A possible negative (but one that applies to most current sets) is that if you hook up older equipment with component or composite cables, you probably won't get a picture in the correct aspect ratio, and of high quality.  You do need HDMI cables (buy Amazon Basics - they're fine, and cheap - a quarter of the price of many!).  I had to buy a new DVD player, as my older (but good) one uses component cables.  I got a more than adequate upscaling (and region-free!) Philips player for $40.  This was well worth it, as the HD display is far superior to the other inputs.  This set'll accept one component connection, and one composite.  If that's not enough because, like me, you have old equipment you still want to use, you can easily use a cheap switch box to get around the issue; I did that for VCR, LaserDisc player, and an MVix media player.One definite negative - there's no support to speak of (there is a warranty, but a measly one year)!  JVC's website won't allow you to register this model range online, nor will it tell you where service centers are located.  That is really dumb! To get any information, you have to call tech support in the Philippines (they won't answer questions via e-mail).  They're polite, but when I had a question about displaying aspect ratios correctly from an older JVC DVD player, and they were of no help - they didn't appear to know what \"aspect ratio\" meant, and could only suggest things to try that I'd already done, as they were obvious - still, a lot of tech \"support\" is like that!  I solved it myself in the end (this was because of the component connection - the trick was to change the display settings in the player from widescreen TV to 1.33:1 TV - counter-intuitive, but it worked).", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simple and great value", "Author": "musiclvr", "ReviewID": "RGH8GHMADZROK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The other reviews that have described the simplicity of this TV are completely accurate.  Out of the box, it was plug and play with no extra software or apps to worry about.  I had a hard time justifying spending $200 to $400 more for a different TV of the same size and performance, just because it had internet connectivity and a bunch of preloaded apps that I don't use.  Those preloaded apps are starting to remind me of what pc's morphed into 10 or 12 years ago, when they would come out of the box with a bunch of garbage that had to be uninstalled before you could personalize your pc the way you wanted it.  No reason to pay extra for that same privilege here.  Having said that, the remote is straightforward and easy to use, the picture and sound are both great, and I can think of nothing negative about this TV.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid TV", "Author": "El Jefe", "ReviewID": "R225XBU6GL8R7D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very nice LCD TV & a pretty good value.  The picture quality is generally good, though the 120hz does make some programs have \"the soap opera effect.\"  However, all 120hz LCD's have this effect & the JVC can disable if you so choose.  There are plenty of options to tweak to get the picture you want.  The manufacturer (same people who make Vizio, btw) really touts the sound on this TV.  It was average IMO.  They can add whatever effects they want, but you just aren't going to get satisfying low end sounds out of 2 10w speakers.  It's pretty much impossible.  That said, the sound is marginally better than most modern LCD TV's & it was very easy to hook up my bookshelf system to get a decent sound experience via RCA plugs.  I got this set on sale for $650 & would consider that price appropriate & a good value, though I wouldn't spend much more than that.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase & think I got a lot of TV for the money.Picture quality: 4/5Sound quality: 3/5Value: 4.5/5Overall: 4/5PS - Amazon's shipping & delivery was fast, free, & there were no problems.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lovin it", "Author": "Coffeecritic", "ReviewID": "R32TEH6O8HGPS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this from costco last week.

It was \"used\" on Amazon from the warehouse. I got it for a good price. Four days later it arrived. It not used but new somebody at the warehouse had a accident with the box and the side was sracthed and sevearl marks. The remote control did not work so I had to set it up was with side switches. Once I got it set up and watched the tv; it was Saturday the first week of the Olypics. I got Great TV, natural color, great detail, running and diving and swimming all with natural body movements, not herky jerky movements. The picture was almost like being there. My oldest son had a Samsung 55\" hd tv that he got about 4/5 years ago for $3500. The JVC has a clearer picture, much higher defintion, truer color, and natural body movments when the running, jumping, playing games,and when a close-up on the actor or player you can see pores on the peoples faces. The second day I watched the \"Matrix\" (a picture I have seen a lot of times). It was like I never seen it before. The picture was like I had gone to a Rave to see this again. I watched it mersemzied. The sound was great, the picture was like being there. Anyone who wants a \"kinda\" cheap for a tv. This the one for you. 47\" wide. outstanding pictue, great detail, great sound, watching football, basketball, baseball, NASCAR it all comes to you as you were there.

While the total number of reviewers was small, compared to those of other models, the JVC had excellent reviews . . . and for good reason.Unfortunately, this TV was not available anywhere locally, so I could see the actual picture performance.  It was sold by both Wal-Mart and Best Buy, but neither one stocked this or had a set on display.  It was an on-line purchase only.  What I did see at these retailers, were TV's which were overpriced and not very impressive.  I decided to trust Amazon's return policy and make the plunge.  I never looked back.This 47\" JVC HDTV (JVC JLC47BC3000) is incredible.  The picture is almost too good.  In fact, many shows and movies look like live TV.  I have been very impressed and happy with this purchase.  In fact, when a second TV died, I purchased the same model in a 32\".One of the other reviewers mentioned that this set has a unique odor.  They are right, but I am of the opinion that this is from the VOC's of the components or packaging materials.

I heard nothing for a week and then called them back only to be told that I was outside the 1 year warranty.  I've called local repair people, but as far as I can tell it's going to run about $80 just to diagnose and $400 in total to repair if I'm lucky.
