{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent - 4 stars for image quality but, 5 stars for value", "Author": "R. White", "ReviewID": "R1EGNAH5TN3LOL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned and sold 32, 42, 50 and 52 inch flat panel TVs over the last four years. Three Samsung's one LG and this Panasonic. Before purchasing this TV I compared this side by side with the competing Samsung 43\" plasma. I made adjustments to these TVs for the best picture possible. The TVs had identical program material sent to them. The colors on the Samsung were a bit brighter especially the blue. But, this does not mean better. The colors on the Panasonic were more natural and had better color definition. The most noticeable difference was the image depth. Background images on the Samsung were a little out of focus compared to the Panasonic. The Panasonic with it's sharper more detailed background had a superior depth of field.I have no hesitation recommending this TV to anyone looking for a reasonably priced 42\" TV with a very good picture quality and better than average sound. Considering that this is a plasma be sure that your room is not to bright or that you can control the amount of light entering your room. I really think that CNET should reconsider their rating on this TV.I've taken time to carefully setup this TV and recommend the following settings for those who purchase this TV and would like to try these settings.Picture Menu: Cinema, 99, 41, 54, 0, 31, Normal, off, off, offP.S. I own a Samsung (PN50B650)50\" plasma that I'm very pleased with. This Panasonic for it's price is a better value and just as pleasing to watch.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT picture from Panasonic TC-P42X5", "Author": "brookhaven1999", "ReviewID": "R1LS2UBOK6YNZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased the Panasonic TC-P42X5 and love it!I initially wanted a 1080p model with a 42 inch screen.Unfortunately, Panasonic discontinued the 42 inch plasma sets with 1080p in 2012 and only produced them with 720p.I read one review that stated that if you are watching a 42 inch screen from a distance of 8 ft. that the human eyecannot distinguish between 720p and 1080p.Based on our experience, I would agree with that. We are COMPLETELY satisfied with the picture we get with this TV.We have it hooked up to a Panasonic DMP-BDT220 Blu-ray player and love both the DVD quality as well as the ability tostream Netflix through the Blu-ray player.In addition, we are using a roof top antenna and not cable and still get excellent TV reception over the Panasonic plasma TV.Here is a copy of the review I had written about the antenna and pre-amp we are using.We live 60 miles east of NYC. Reception has been a problem using only an antenna.I just installed a Winegard HD7698P HDTV High Band VHF-UHF Antenna with a Channel Master CM-7778 Titan Medium-Gain Mast Mounted Preamplifier.Signal strength was 34% before installation of this Preamp and Antenna; it has now increased to 52%.Stations that we receive come in sharper. However, I still cannot get CBS or NBC.Update: Recently we purchased a Panasonic TC-P42X5 plasma TV to replace an old analog set that we had been using with adigital converter box. Apparently the digital receiver in the new TV is much stronger than the digital converter box, because TV reception from our roof top Winegard HD7698P Antenna is much better now. Signal strength has increased from 52%to 85% (and above) which has pulled in more channels including CBS, Fox, and Channel 9.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "AMAZING", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R3OUK5HZI47PNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv as an Early birthday present to myself.

It's a great bargain for $500 if you're looking for a high quality, basic HDTV without all the marginally useful bells and whistles that drive the final price up to $1,000 or more. This is the latest generation of plasma HD manufactured by the market leader, Panasonic. Do a little homework and you'll quickly understand the advantages of plasma and realize that 720p is more than adequate.The Owner's Manual is well written and easily understood. The unit has a \"Custom\" settings option which allows you to tweak the picture to suit the room and your viewing preferences. The whites ARE white and the blacks ARE black with all the colors faithfully rendered. There are numerous default preset options for those who prefer to take that route. Don't be concerned about the reflective surface of the screen unless you're planning to view this HDTV outdoors or in a discount department store.  Finally, the package includes an HDMI cable that will save you $20-$30 and simplify your installation. No technical skill required.Go for it!!NOTE: This review was updated on 1/20/2013 -- no buyer's remorse here. :)", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Plasma", "Author": "Willis", "ReviewID": "REO2INV54GEKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are glad we waited.  Many generations of televisions have come and gone.  We stuck with our crt.  Friends paid thousands of dollars for sets they got rid of long ago.

Build QualityThe back of the TV is made mostly out of metal, and the front edges are covered in plastic. The unit feels strong, but the base seems a little weak. The plastic edges scratch easily, but you can't tell unless there is a light reflecting off it. The screen feels like it is made of glass, whereas some other TV screens are made of plastic. I have dropped the remote over 5 feet several times, and all that happened was the batteries fell out.  Image QualityI was worried about not getting full HD(1080p), but the image quality is great. There are many options for the picture, and the screen brightness can go pretty high. I was playing a game with a dark setting so it was hard to see so I just turned up the brightness and I was able to see fine. I left a still image on the screen for over 4 hours and there was no burn-in, so no worries there. The 600hz Sub-field drive works great, although I haven't watched sports or anything that you would really need it for so I don't if it would work for that.Overall it is a great TV.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "4 star value, but weak in key specific area's", "Author": "Robert west", "ReviewID": "R22C24G3HXFLKY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ended up returning this TV. It has some clearly defined strengthsand weaknesses. The big factor that i cannot deny here is that the720p compared to the same plamsa model in 1080p flat out does not lookas good and that's for everything games,movies, internet, SD and  HD.1080p is the way things are going. And it irks me that all plasmamakers have phased out 1080p in 42 inch tv's i beleive there will be abacklash and they will come back around in a couple years.. I wantedto like this tv, but for my applications (TV,gaming, and internetbrowsing/computing) i need a 42 inch LED or LCD. I hope to get a50inch plasma (this same model) in 1080 for my living room.The refresh rate is super fast on this tv which is good and bad.Compared to my old LCD it is almost dizzing how fast it is. At it'sworst LCD's make things look herky jerky and they lag images. This ishorrible particulary on video games. I beleive that this tv is one youwant to watch from a further viewing distance than a similar sized LCDbecause the imaging is very fast, almost dizzing when you are to closeto it. The difference of the speed of the images is huge. Plasmaalmost seems hyper, but again perhaps that is because i was used to apiece of junk vizio 1080 that was kinda \"sluggish\" with it's refresh rate.The deep colors, and blended natural look of plasma is still ondisplay here. Plasma is warmer, it does not have a sterile pixelatedwashed out look. Sound quality is good. Price is good. The design andaesthetics great.One other deal breaker for me was that for internet use the whitebackrounds do not look good. Whites look dirty and seem obscured. Ifyou ever watch a white backround tv commercial side by side with anLCD TV in a store display you will see how dampened the plasma'swhites are. Keep in mind though whites are not as prevalent as themyriad of colors that movies have. The color production is great. Thefast imaging of this TV is outstanding on a playstation 3. Plasmatechnology is great for gamers. I could have lived with this tv if it were 1080p. I have given ittime and decided that after having had a 1080p TV, 720p is anoticeable downgrade. When faces are very close and large on thescreen they look great, when things are small and distant that's whereyou see the real lack of detail and the inferiority of 720p. This isan arguing point for some people, some have claimed that the human eyecannot distinguish the difference between the two resolutions whenthey are sitting more than 8 feet away. I was hoping for that when ibought this tv but it just is not true. They look very different atany distance. And not apples and oranges different. The 1080p justlooks better. This TV can be gotten cheap. And some will find itpreferable than similar priced TV's. Plasma tv's have a unique look to themthat makes them desireable. But this TV is a 720p living in a 1080p world.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV and fantastic value -- Get one while you can!!!", "Author": "Navy Comm O", "ReviewID": "R3D8WTQPXENE9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to replace a wonderful but very old Panasonic 32\" CRT that finally gave up the ghost just before Christmas.  It is a totally satisfactory replacement and I recommend it strongly.I had admired the new LED screens, but as I began investigating refresh rates and looking at the displays in stores, I came to the conclusion I would prefer a plasma screen, but my space would not accommodate anything larger than a 42\".  Which made this model absolutely perfect.  Sears had the best price, but they were sold out by the time I placed an order.  However, Walmart had the next best price at $398, so I ordered one for pickup at a local store.  As it turned out, they were out of stock locally, but were able to get one within 10 days.  It was well worth the wait.In comparison to similarly sized LED TV's, this model is slightly heavier ( just under 40 pounds out of the box).  Of course, in comparison to the old CRT, it was much much lighter.  The stand assembled easily and seems quite sturdy.  8 screws total and a ratchet and it was ready for cables to be attached.This is an HDTV.  I may eventually bite the bullet and get HD service from Comcast, but even with the normal, non-HD cable box, the image is wonderful and light years beyond my old CRT.  And the sound is GREAT!  Unlike many of the LED models I considered, the sound on this model is better than on my old CRT and no need to get a sound bar.  Right now I have it hooked up to an older Panasonic VCR/DVD recorder/player (non Blu-ray), an Apple TV (for streaming Netflix and which uses one of the two HDMI connections) and my Comcast cable box.  It was easy to set up and I am very satisfied with the image quality.  Speaking of which, I used the settings provided by R. White in his review, although I changed the tint to a -3 rather than the 0 he uses, and strongly recommend you try them as a point of departure.  I am now assessing universal remotes to replace the four I currently need to operate the various components and will probably settle on a Logitech Harmony model.If you are looking for a good and serviceable TV and don't need a larger size than 42\"' or more than two HDMI connections, or the other bells and whistles, this is a fantastic choice.  I don't understand the relatively low marks it gets in its review by CNET; In my opinion, it is much better than the review indicates.  The advantage with the plasma is you don't need to worry about the refresh rate and the picture is great no matter what angle you watch from.  (Note that if the room in which you are will place this unit has a lot of natural light, you may prefer the LED.)  Also, as other reviewers have said, for this size of TV, I really don't think the eye can distinguish between 720p and 1080, and the image quality is really quite satisfactory.  With the addition of an Apple TV or Blue-ray player with WiFi, you have the equivalent of a smart TV without paying the premium for one. Even at $500, this TV is a very good buy and better than you will find most of the LED's of similar size.  If you can find one for under $400, grab it!

If you've read the reviews on CNET, you'd run from this TV.  The biggest issue was a green tint that was impossible to eliminate.  But the price was so good ($297) that I had to give it a try.  When I first hooked it up, sure enough, there was a green tint to everything.  I adjusted the controls to no avail and really regretted my decision.  But as the day went on, it became less and less green.  By the next day, the picture was beautifully balanced.  I can only guess that the tv needed a burn in period.  While this tv in not \"feature rich\", it's picture is truly fantastic for the money paid.  In fact, better than the 60\" I bought last year for 5 times the price.
