{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wonderful!", "Author": "John \"zatez\"", "ReviewID": "R1T49YIUJYK0DA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this TV.  I purchased it and immediately put it up on my wall.  I use all of the component video in's and the PC in.  I attached my DVD player with the component in using Monster THX 800 cables, some of the best cables on the market. The picture quality shows it.  My other component in is attached to my X-Box, let me tell you, the TV makes the difference while playing the games.  As of right now I do not have HDTV but I do plan on hooking it up.  As for the PC input it is absolutely wonderful.  When I got this TV I also got a wireless mouse/keyboard combo so I can use the TV from my bed and or my Lazy-Boy chair.Pros: Size (fits anywhere on any wall), Picture quality, Video (in's / pc in), Easy useage.Cons: No HDMI input, DVI in, No HDTV tuner, Replacement parts are expensive (Power adapter= $155)Overall Rating of TV:  9.7 / 10", "Date": "February 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "sharp tv", "Author": "D.

The packing was a little weird. Just had a giant box and all kinds of strange stuff to get by. Almost like my 13 year old daughter packed it. But.. it was fine. No scratches or broken parts. Other than that I love it.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sharp TV  - Quality of Picture and Delivery", "Author": "Michelle Goodrich", "ReviewID": "R13O1OJXF5DXI1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The quality of the screen (I'm using it as a TV) is not as good as my old 1987 bedroom TV. Other reviewers were pleased, maybe it works better connected to a PC? I've gone through the setup a number of times. Can't get a clear picture.It is compact and fits well on the counter top. Also, it was easy to setup.For delivery an appointment had to be scheduled so I had to come home from work for a 4 hour period to have this item delivered. This is the first time any service didn't deliver to my door and this item isn't more than usual orders.", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "Dave E. Young", "ReviewID": "R147LXH6Y0ZLM7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My Setup: Satellite - Non High Def S-Video (Monster Cable - high end). Picture ranges from good to great. Channel dependant. Originally purchased a Toshiba SD P4000 (liked the attahced DVD player). While the Toshiba was considerably cheaper (and smaller 14\") you get what you pay for. The Toshiba picture quality was unacceptable with my set up (Pixilation issues). As a computer monitor on my 4 year old Dell Laptop with ATI Mobility Graphic card 32mb  display is crystal clear. This TV supports HI-DEF. It has a very small footprint and fits nicely on the corner of my desk. Sound is adequate for a small room. Overall while a little on the expensive side, I would highly recommend it. Saw this unit with a component feed in the store (DVD hookup) - was incredible - will be purchasing a dvd player for this guy soon and perhaps a hi-def sat receiver or better yet move the TV to where I already have one to test it out :-). Portable enough to bring on trips for gaming console.Pros : Footprint / Portability / Display quality / Manual adjustments or can set most settings to 'auto'. 60,000 hour rating / enough inputsCons: PC Monitor only supports 640x480 or 1024x768 have to ensure PC is at this resolution.
