{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just Perfect", "Author": "S. Caldwell", "ReviewID": "R2P3HRU1Y08222", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing the research, we decided on this tv because it fit the bill with the 120 refresh rate, the latest technology with 1080p, etc.  It arrived this morning and after maybe 10 minutes of careful unpacking and attaching the pedestal to the screen it was up and running.Our jaws were on the floor at how amazingly beautiful it is.  The clarity is stunning and 40 inches turned out to be a good size.  Its big enough to appreciate the big game or a blu-ray movie, but not so ostentatious that you can't use it everday for the news and regular programming.We did some shopping around first and Best Buy as of 6/30/08 wanted $1899 for this tv, oh and don't forget to add tax which is 9% here.  All said and done we saved close to $400 by purchasing it on Amazon which makes it seem like we got the Playstation 3 that we also ordered for free.All said and done, it is showstopping even when it isn't on.  The EnergyStar endorsement is a bonus also considering that larger tvs are notorious energy consumers.About The Seller: OneCallWith a large purchase such as this, I was a little reluctant to buy a tv over the internet.  The price couldn't be beat though.Within 12 hours I had an email from their company notifying me of their shipping policies and within 24 hours another email with detailed tracking information.  All of this was also followed up by a personal phone call from a company representative that kept me in the loop.  My tv was shipped by ABF based on a scheduled appointment that was set up ahead of time.  OneCall encourages you to call your motor freight company that they assign if they don't call you first.Ok, key things to know about my shipping experience with this tv-- Again, tv was shipped by motor freight for CURBSIDE delivery.  Meaning that he lowered it to the curb and my husband and I carried it into the house.  It wasn't heavy at all, but needed two people because of the size of the box.- Company would only accept return of the tv in the event that it was damaged during shipping.  When you sign off on the bill of lading, you are instructed beforehand in the emails to note any scuffs, dents or otheriwse damage to the original packing.  There was nothing wrong with my television even though there were a few small scuffs on the box and they were noted.- The tv box came equipped with ShockWatch stickers that were to turn red if the box had been impacted or was mishandled, dropped etc.  The stickers were clear on my box, so they took good care of it from the time of shipping to arrival at my curb.All in all the service was great, the tv works and looks fantastic and I highly reccomend both.____________UPDATE__8/28/10______________________________________________________________2 years and one new house later, this tv is still amazingly beautiful and I'm highly considering buying another one for the guest room upstairs.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV, great value for money", "Author": "Manish Rastogi \"Manish\"", "ReviewID": "R14QKNMC1BUCYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"I've had my 40W4100 for 3 weeks now.

I read professionals' and owners' reviews and, in the end, it was either the 40W4100 or the Samsung 630.  I just tought the features of other higher-end models from both companies were not that much significant (but the 120Hz refreshing rate is, in my opinion).  I went to the store (well, a few stores ...) and both product provide just a awesome picture.  Very hard choice I must say, I hesitated and walked around the store like a freak for almost an hour.  Because I owned other Sony products in the past and never had any problem, I decided to pick up the 40W4100. Ho boy, I'm glad I did !!!!  Awesome, really awesome picture!Well, I needed to return the first one I got because of defective pixels (at that price, one stuck pixel is one too much!, but because of the 30-day return policy, Future Shop sent another one quickly, no problem -- tough now I'm frantickly checking if any new defective pixel appears, and I pray, yes I pray that none will appear after my 30-day deadline passed, tough I heard that, in general, most defective pixels will show up quickly, or not at all, hope its true - anyone technically inclined can comment on this???).Just hook up the second one, very easy.  This TV is really amazing!  I just tested this beautiful baby with two blu-ray movie (the first episode of Planet earth, and Polar express) and its just, wow ... I'm out of words ... beautiful ... as you might have heard before, once you tasted HD TV, you will never go back !  (I can't believe I was on tube TV just a few days ago).  I'm hooked up on ordinary cable for now, and the image is pretty bad (but this is expected with a 1080p).  I can't wait to see a hockey game once my HD box is installed !!!Well, my review is not really different from others, but I just wanted to add my general perception of this product.  The KDL-40W4100 is just a great HD TV.  I'm pretty sure the 630 is awesome too (reviews are quite good too) and I must day, for me Samsung has one small advantage -- I wish Sony would provide a swiveling stand like Samsung.Now even if I'm not religious at all, I'm praying that no defective pixel will appear ...*****  IMPORTANT UPDATE (12/31/2008):Well, it's happening again.  Future Shop sent me a replacement, as stated in my review above, and two defective pixels (both stuck on green) appeared within 7 days.  I am soooo pissed.  Two defective TV in a row, can you believe this.  Either I am \"Mr Bad Luck\" .. or Sony does not care much about the quality of their products.  I mean, two in a row, it is more than random rate !!!  Are you kidding me!  I have a researh lab and I have, in all, 6 LCD screens.  Not one has a single defective pixel, not one.  Now I'm buying this expensive TV and two of their sets in row are defective.  Of course, Sony (and other companies) will tell you that it is not defective and that it is \"normal\" that a few defective pixels appear.  This is just BS for the masses.  The problem is, big companies like Sony want to cut their expenses at the Quality Assessment Department.  They know most (not all) consumers are too dumb and will let go.  Consumers should not accept this BS.  Let's imagine you buy a brand new car, say a nice BMW.  The seller tell you: \"well, sir, it is possible that there are some scratches on the hood or elwhere.  But it is normal, and your car is functioning just fine anyway.\"  Would you accept this?  No, or course!  I am so pissed at Sony (the 40W4100 is made in Mexico, at first I tought it would be better than crap made in China, but I guess I was wrong).  I'm gonna ask for another (second) replacement, and if there is a problem with defective pixel (even a single one is too much for a product of that price) again within the 30-day period, I will go with the Samsung LN40A630 -- and will not buy a Sony product again.  Too bad because I really like this TV (awesome picture really, looks good too) when it's not defective.  But if Sony does not care about the quality of their products, why should I buy their products.", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "If You Are Looking for Best Price & Features: Look No More!!!", "Author": "C.

I asked my very knowledgeable brother who recommended this as one of 15 TVs to look at. I went to Best Buys to see some of the models in action and liked the quality of this model but it was not what I wanted to spend and they would not price match off of a website. So I went to Amazon and found a great deal and free shipping from OneCall. Not to mention that OneCall was fast and easy to deal with. I could not tell you the specs of this TV but the picture and sound are (wait for it) awesome. I put in the Matrix after a relatively easy set up just to see, and there was no picture blurring the 120hz (okay this is one of two specs that I know) made a huge difference.  It is a good looking TV, its nice to have a good picture along with something aesthetically pleasing (can't help it I'm an art student)  and the picture is AMAZING for movies.I know after reading SO many reviews that Sony is not know for its Black quality, if that is really important yo may not want to get this TV but I really can not tell unless there was a plasma TV next to it. I do not have HD cable but the picture is pretty darn good. I think I may have to step it up and get HD now.

I went to the SONY web site and reviewed the features of all their models and sizes, size of screen vs viewing distance, etc, etc. I am a retired Engineer and of course studied as much info and personal opinions as I could find. Consumers Union Magazine is always a great source of technical features, quality of product and failure history. As reported by others, my TV was hand carried into my house. They were ready to unpack and assemble it for no additional charge, but I chose to do that myself. With the help of a friend, we assembled and set it up. All features worked perfectly. I made some video and sound adjustments to our personal liking. Super easy to follow the \"on screen menu\" for all features. A FANTASTIC picture with EXCELLENT sound. Not inexpensive, BUT if you desire the best, I believe this is IT!There were even more expensive SONY models, but the additional features for the extra money were not worth it to me. Watching sporting events is NOW better than being there. National Geographic specials \"come alive\" in HD on this set. EVERYTHING is more PLEASING and INTERESTING to watch in HD on this set !!!!! A special technical SONY feature on this model makes rapid motion across the screen SMOOTH!!! If you watch sports or racing, check this out on other sets and see the difference.

Claxton", "ReviewID": "R1ZXH92VZSEYCT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my eye on an HD set for some time now. I've investigated other brands, the options available on sets, the pros and cons. The websites that I visited seem to have a very high rating for the Sony KDL-40W4100, even to the point of saying that the television has one of the best pictures across the board. I eventually decided to invest in this Sony product. And boy was it a great choice. The digital stations come in with incredible clarity and detail. The number and type of A/V inputs was also very appealing. I also invested in a HD Sony receiver and blue ray player. Although the HDMI cables are incredibly expensive, it is well worth it for the picture (and the digital audio). There are so many options on this tv that I haven't investigated all of them. The only draw back to this set is the learning curve for this kind of technology (which may be higher for me, not being technologically inclined). A very interesting option that stands out is the \"Cinemotion\", which I think is only available on the W series. I'm not exactly sure how to describe it, but it almost gives the video a 3D look. While it's pretty cool, this aspect may take some getting use to if you decide to use it. All in all, I'm very happy with the television: crystal clear picture, lots of detail, no motion blurring (thanks to the 120Hz picture cycling). Compared to other LCD sets, this would stand out at the top in my opinion. In fact, I see very little to no advantage of upgrading to the XBR series.

Franks\"", "ReviewID": "RE7I78WBP88KA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to get this TV for 1098 shipped using Ebay's buy it now along with live search.  At the time live search was allowing you to save 25% up to 200.00. At the 1298 price tag it was a great deal, but with the extra 200.00 off it's an absolute steal.  My only beef is with the company I bought it from \"Pyxis Camera\" they constantly gave me the run around and it took almost 3 weeks to get the TV from date of purchase, but I have it now and it was totally worth the wait.It took me almost 3 weeks of constant fiddling to get the picture the way I wanted it, but that's because it has so many features and settings.  That's a positive note for me as I prefer to have more settings and features so I can get the picture exactly how I want it.  I set it to vivid as I felt that gave me the blackest blacks and the whitest whites.  I then turned the color down as everybody looked as though they had a Hollywood tan and I prefer more natural skin tones.  I also turned off the noise reduction as when it was on people tended to look soft.  I turned on the mpeg noise reduction as it helps reduce the pixellation you get when the camera pans.  I turned off cinemotion as well as I do not like the effect it creates.I also use this as my primary computer monitor as its hooked up to a htpc.  I play 1080p mkv files and they are ridiculous, smooth as butter.  If you are familiar with the scene in the Dark Knight where the hospital blows up the explosion itself is extremely clean. I have looked at it from literally inches away looking for the slightest imperfection with the fast motion associated with an explosion and I can't find one flaw.  Kinda makes me wonder what that 120hz is really doing because as a computer monitor it will only operate at 60hz.  If you use it as a computer monitor you cannot have cinemotion on as it causes slight hesitations due to the 60hz refresh not the 120hz refresh.  On the computer input I do have game mode turned on as that's supposed to help and it does make a positive noticeable difference.Is the 120hz worth it?  I don't have a V series to compare it to so I cannot say for sure. If you can find a way to get it for the 1098 I paid I would say go for it, but if you pay closer to the 1300.00 on-line or 1700.00 at Best Buy you may want to re-consider.  Maybe get the V series instead and spend the difference on a blu-ray player or a good receiver.I really cannot say enough as to how amazing this TV really is, if your still on the fence contact me at jsf29@nau.edu and I will do my best to answer any questions you may have.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "One of The Best Flat Tv Ever", "Author": "Enrique Schmilinsky", "ReviewID": "R3LAGQFN3V6R56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV just reading the reviews left in here because I work overseas.

I've got a PS3, a Dreamcast, a Wii and a Pioner CLD-D702 LaserDisc player hooked up to it along with a nice surge protector (I live in San Francisco in an apartment with really old wiring).I immediately fell in love with the ability to calibrate the TV for each individual device. Instead of having long reference lists of sharpness, contrasts and hues for each one. A small deal, but it makes a hell of a difference between so many previous gen devicesPS3- Looks fantastic, but that's pretty much a no-brainer.Wii- It doesn't fair well without happy component cables.LaserDiscs- If you have any in CAV format, you're in for a treat! Because the CAVs 30fps interacts quite nicely with the 120Hz motion flow. My jaw was on the floor when I first watched Akira.I went with this instead of an XBR because I thought this was the best looking model on the floor in terms of realism. Planet Earth looked better on this TV than any other. I was allowed to calibrate each Bravia in the store, and the x.v. color just seemed like a pointless extra at the time. But I am about to purchase a new Canon Vixia HV20 and it has the capacity for x.v. color and the Bravia KDL-40W4100 does not.

Though technology is continuously advancing I purchased at a time when this item was at it's lowest just above $1,000. Because just about everyone else purchased their huge LCD HDTV's too early my \"little\" 40 inch is MORE advanced than theirs. This set has an AUTO adjust - meaning I was watching a regular DVD and the set auto adjusted to full screen. It also auto adjusted the cable HD channels to full screen the first time and it just stays full screen. The Cable HD channels are wonderfully clear and crisp however the 120Hz does not kick in. I think it's because the networks are not that advanced enough just yet. So it's just the 1080p HD that's at work. BUT when watching a Blu Ray DVD or playing the PS3 games THAT's when I can CLEARLY see the 120Hz working. I purchased special 120Hz HDMI 12 foot cables 10.3GBPS (from Amazon only $14 or $15) to ensure the picture quality is not lost. The picture is bright and very colorful.

Not only are colors vibrant, lifelike, and highly detailed in its gorgeous 1080p True HD, but the 120hz Motionflow technology makes the events you witness on screen literally come alive. If I had to choose two words to describe the picture quality of this TV, I would choose \"smooth\" and \"breathtaking.\" Anything from a hummer chase in the Blu-ray version of The Incredible Hulk, to an intense firefight in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare for the PS3, to a ginger stroll in the DVD (season 1) version of House, to mammoth images of New York skyscrapers in the HD broadcast version of Good Morning America, this TV will cause you to be completely impressed by the brilliance of its picture and the seamless quality in which the images are presented to you. Every person I have shown this TV to has been blown away by the quality of the picture and the nearly-3D effect produced by the 120hz Motionflow technology.I was also pleasantly surprised by the tv's remarkable sound quality. The detail of the sound, when combined with the TV's smooth and breathtaking picture quality allows you to truly be transported into the world of whatever it is you're watching.Another pleasant surprise came from the \"TV Guide\" function of the TV. Since I am a standard (non-digital)cable subscriber, I am, at the push of a button on the TV's remote, able to access a specialized menu which allows me to see all of my channels, the programming which will be on them, the time they will be on, and programs that will be on later in the day. This is not to be confused with cable's \"TV Guide Channel\"--this is an entirely different APPLICATION which works with the TV. The channel menu screen is similar to what you would see on a satellite channel menu--giving you the freedom to see what is on and allowing you to, with great speed, highlight the channel you want to go to, press enter, and be transported to that channel.If you want a TV with breathtaking picture quality, amazingly smooth transitions between images, great sound quality, and (if you're a standard, non-digital cable subscriber) a nifty TV Guide application, then you will be absolutely thrilled with this TV. I've now had this TV for almost a month, and I am impressed by something new everyday. This TV has given new life to my older DVDs, my ultra-modern Blu-rays, my beloved PS3 games, and my favorite shows on primetime television. In other words, this TV has revolutionized the way I experience visual entertainment.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great TV", "Author": "Show-me Jim", "ReviewID": "R132ZQ1HCW6ZRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have now owned this TV for a month and have yet to find any problems. We receive the local TV stations by antenna, all of which are broadcasting digital signals, but not always in high definition, but even the non-HD digital pictures look good.  When the broadcast is in high definition the picture is dramatically sharp, with excellent black levels, accurate colors and contrast.  I cannot imagine having any better sound from any TV without hooking it up through a stereo receiverBefore purchasing this TV I made many trips to local stores to compare the pictures of the different brands of televisions, always finding the Sonys to have the best pictures, or at least tied with other brands.  The Sony reputation and having the TV Guide feature and PIP won me over.I considered getting a plasma, as was worried about the reported LCD motion blurring problem.  However, in the stores the pictures on most of the plasma televisions always seems to be a little dull visually, lacking the dramatic \"punch\" of the LCD picture.  Therefore, I decided to get a LCD TV with 120 Hz refresh rate.  However, in reality my experience is that motion blur does not seem to be an issue with LCD televisions.  For me it's difficult to tell whether the 120 Hz feature is turned on or off.After reading the Cnet.com review on this TV, which mentions sudden darkening and brightening of the backlight in certain situations, I was a little apprehensive.  However, after several hours of watching the TV over the past month, we have yet to experience any such problem.  Also, we have yet to see any white dot sparkles, which have been mentioned by some reviewers. A Sony firmware update very possibly fixed this.  I downloaded the update from Sony's web site a couple days after we received the TV.Yes, you might pay a little more for the Sony brand name, but with Sony you usually get what all consumers want, a good quality product.

It's only weakness is that which all LCDs share, less than perfect black/contrast compared to plasma. But in that regard it is equal to or better than any other LCDs I've seen. Certainly the image quality in color accuracy, detail, depth are exceptional. The 120Hz refresh rate is a treat when watching live sports as there is no real lag or latency.

I never thought I would pay so much money for a television in my life, but I have no regrets whatsoever.  In fact, this is one of the best purchases I've ever made.I did put a good bit of thought into my selection and purchase.  Most of the technical concepts of high-definition TV were a mystery to me, so I tried my best to figure out which features I had to have, which ones I would like to have, and which ones I could afford.  Frankly, I don't remember all of that technical mumbo-jumbo anymore.  Obviously, I wanted a TV capable of Full HD 1080p - anything less than that, and you're just wasting your money, especially when and if you make the move to Blue-ray.  The refresh rate was also important, as you need to have a refresh rate that is a multiple of 24 (since most movies and modern TV shows are shot at 24 frames per second) if you want everything you see to be smooth and natural on the screen; since this Sony model featured Motionflow 120Hz technology and true 24p True Cinema capability, I was satisfied that I was getting the best technology that I could afford.  I should say that I decided on Sony pretty early on in the decision-making process, after reading up on Sony's BRAVIA engine technology.  Another selling point of this television is its virtual surround sound system, which more than meets my temporary needs until such time as I can put together a true home theater system.  Sound was important to me because I've never liked the sound on the previous TV I purchased back in 2001 - in fact, I have to forego virtual surround sound options on that old one in order to have any chance of understanding what people are saying on the screen.  I'm more than satisfied with the two-speaker virtual surround sound on this Sony BRAVIA, though.If you're thinking about buying one of these mega-TVs, I would encourage you to go out to some electronics store and actually take a look at the different models.  I knew I didn't want anything smaller than a 40-inch screen, but I wasn't sure the 40-inch was big enough to really satisfy me.  At the same time, I didn't want to go overboard with the size because video quality can become an issue with greater size and because I planned to use this TV in my computer room rather than my den (because that is where I spend almost all of my time).  When I actually went out and compared sizes for myself, I was a little surprised at just how big the 40-inch really was, and it ended up being a perfect fit for me, both physically and aesthetically.  You don't want a TV too big for its space, as this is an investment you want to keep as safe and secure as possible.  Bear this in mind, especially if you have children (or clumsy friends).Of course, you'll need to purchase an HDMI cable separately in order to take full advantage of this TV's high-definition capabilities, and don't think you have to spend a fortune on it, either.  As for hooking up your cable box, DVD player, VHS player, or whatever, you've got a virtual control panel of ready options on this set.  For starters, there are four HDMI ports, meaning this TV will take whatever high definition component you want to throw at it.  You also have component, S-video, standard audio and video ports as well as a PC input port.  Your old VCR may not really utilize the capabilities of this television, but you don't have to worry about not being able to still use it.If I had anything bad to say about this product, I would definitely say it.  Unless you're swimming in money, the purchase of an HD TV like this involves some sacrifice, and you surely don't want to be stuck paying for something you aren't happy with.  The fact is, though, that I have nothing but positive things to say about this television.  Now that football season has returned, I'm loving this Sony more than ever.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "TV great - almost perfect experience", "Author": "J.

Worked perfectly out of the box, beautiful screen, crystal clear clarity, awesome picture in HD, easy menu and options.  The only downside is the price has dropped $80 since I bought it, and I got it for a steal at $1016 delivered.  This TV is an unbelievable bargain, great value for the money and I can't imagine performance being any better than this.  I almost bought a Samsung A650 but they went out of stock everywhere and the price got jacked $300.  I highly recommend the Sony W4100 to anyone looking for their first LCD HDTV.

Knuetter", "ReviewID": "R2IZ87HGVPFU2F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the TV as a Christmas present.  That night the TV broke and we called Sony and they had us run through tests and they said it was no good and they would send us a new one.  First we had to fax the purchase order over.  We did this and it wouldn't go through, our fax was working theirs wasn't but they had no other fax # they could give us until after the 100th time apparently there was another fax # which wouldn't pick up.  Finally after many failed attempts the fax finally went through but they couldn't find it.  So this took a while. We called many times and got many different answers. Then they told us the new TV would arrive on Wed. 12/31/08 and when it didn't show up we called again and they said it would be there on Fri. 1/02/09 and when it didn't show up again we called back and got attitude and nobody knew anything and of course we didn't receive it b/c it wasn't shipped yet.  So I called again this morning and was told maybe by the end of the week but there was nothing they could do about it.  So WARNING!!!  SONY has too many people and nobody can tell you anything.  Last night one of their workers told me they couldn't help me and had no information for me.  How can that be???  Oh and this was after I was put on hold for almost 1 hour...yes that is right 1 HOUR!!! The guys response when I mentioned the time I was on hold was \"So what's your problem?\"  I told him I was disputing this with my credit card and all I get for a response is \"oh well, I don't care\".  Sony might make good products but their service is horrible and it was a big chunk of money paid for this TV that we still don't have!!!!  There sits the broken one and maybe with hopes sometime this month we will receive the new one.  I am so disappointed and I think more disappointed in the fact that Sony customers don't care how we feel.  It's not their problem and they just don't care.  That's not a good thing in that industry.  I can honestly say I will never purchase another Sony product in my life and I will never be able to give them a good review ever!!!
