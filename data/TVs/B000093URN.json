When comparing it to other TV's at the store it seemed a little dimmer but had a cleaner picture.  Once it was in my living room it looked absolutely great.  The picture is viewable when seated or sitting on the floor at about 160 degrees and remains clear and bright even during the day time (and I have a skylight right above the TV).  The only complaint I have is that if you're eye level is about 2 feet above the screen, the picture almost completely disappears, but since I usually sit while watching tv, this is not an issue.I also use the tv with my XBox and Plastation 2 and with the composite video connections it looks great.", "Date": "October 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV - Recommended", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2TDHKVNDX3ZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this TV - Best priced 51\" on the market as well!

This television came COMPLETLY assembled, and with no setup problems whatsoever.  I literally set the box down, cut it open slid the top off, shoved the set back into the place it resides now, hooked everything up and it worked FLAWLESSLY. I would bet on the first reviewer not actually owning this television due to the extreme nature of the misinformation he put out there. Rest assured, the picture quality on this set is second to none in its price range, and in my (and from what I have read, many others) eye it has a better picture than sets costing mor in many cases. The setup is very intuitive, anyone with half a brain can get this thing up and running in no time.I had looked at several TV's and after narrowly avoiding the sony mistake, I am VERY glad I went with this model.", "Date": "February 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Can we say not so \"wow\"", "Author": "D. Rodrigues \"I'd rather be cycling\"", "ReviewID": "R2G3ARPPVKQHMY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WARNING! I've had this set for 2 years and have come to learn is does have problem. When you adjust the volume, an image of a volume bar appears on the screen. Over time, this image will burn itself on the screen. Make sure and select a set that lets you turn off the volume control image or moves it around on the screen to avoid screen burn-in.After weeks of reading about HDTV I came to the conclusion that eventually, you simply must make a choice and go with it. I feel like a made the right choice with this set. Viewing DVDs, the image quality looks every bit as good as I remember seeing it in a theater on the big screen. Older movies don't look quite as good but then again, they don't look bad either. For example, a new movie like X-men 2 is stunning while an older movie like Silverado is not quite as crystal clear. One nice surprise, regular cable TV looks very nice and the settings on the set allow you to display \"normal\" 4:3 format in the wide-screen mode with little notice of distortion.  The back of the set offers many connection options. While the set is heavy, it comes with hidden casters that make it easy to move. I was somewhat concerned about the condition of the set on the day it was delivered as it was freezing cold and I worried that might harm the set. I let it adjust to room temp before I powered it up but the convergence was fine. Right out of the box I was totally pleased with the picture quality.I want to add that my set came fully assembled. I've been using it for about a month and I'm completely happy with it.", "Date": "February 11, 2004"}, {"Title": "The First Reviewer Has the Wrong System in Mind", "Author": "MARK SCOTT MOSTY", "ReviewID": "R3TUDBCK5IISM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading these two reviews, I felt I had to try to set this record straight: I completely agree with the second reviewer. This is an EXCELLENT TV. I had absolutely no problems setting up or using mine and it came completely assembled. As the second reviewer said, all you do is take it out of the box, plug it in and it fired up. Setup involved answering a few on-screen questions and that was it. I too have been impressed with the quality of the picture and feel that I made a smart buy with this TOSHIBA. I think the first reviewer either was taken by the local Rex store or he has this 51\" mixed up with some other model. Nothing he described matched my experience with this TV. Believe the second guy....both of us had basically the same results.", "Date": "March 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "Buying It a Second Time", "Author": "Connie", "ReviewID": "R2SUG41ENOOGMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this TV.  The picture was awesome while watching regular programming from DirecTV or watching DVDs.  The sound was also excellent - the best I've heard from any projection TV without using a Home Theater system.  However, I purchased mine as a \"factory reconditioned\" product which had not been repaired properly and still had a problem when it was shipped to me.  I've since returned it to the vendor and am awaiting a credit on my card. Once the credit is received, I plan on purchasing this model once again because it is a great TV.  I've compared it to other brands in its price range and also some much higher priced and still prefer this Toshiba.  This time, however, I'll purchase through Amazon, brand new, not reconditioned.  By the way, the set comes in a big box, which is cut open, removed and then you have a FULLY ASSEMBLED TV which gets plugged in.  IT DOES NOT COME IN PIECES.  Toshiba is not selling \"puzzle piece TVs.\" The guy who says it comes in pieces is either in need of treatment or has a gripe against Toshiba.", "Date": "March 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "excellent quality, superior value", "Author": "Orlando \"mcmachete\"", "ReviewID": "RUKP77LNU9RL6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Back when I purchased this TV, I installed and repaired home theater systems and home electronics. I currently work in the TV industry in Hollywood. I know my TVs. I know picture quality.After EXTENSIVE research on HDTVs and widescreen projection televisions, I bought the Toshiba 51H83. Just do yourself a favor and visit a local electronics store and see for yourself: the picture quality is crisp and vibrant and it stands out head and shoulders above all other rear-projection TVs. While most rear-projection TVs tend to be dark and difficult to watch from angles not directly in front of the TV, Toshiba's proprietary technology is much more forgiving and provides a more immersive experience.Also, the sound quality of the speakers is fantastic. They have great depth and range (something uncommon with most TVs) thank to SRS WOW, which makes a mere 20-watts-per-channel over achieve. I own a 700-watt surround sound system that I now combine with the TV's excellent speakers, thanks to the ability of the TV to use its speakers as the center channel when in surround sound mode.And it, of course, has all the features you would come to expect from a high-end TV (PIP, etc.).I reserved writing a review until I used it for some time, and after almost a year, I'm as in love with it as I was the first day I bought it.Disregard the reviewer who gave it one star, the television comes completely assembled, unless, of course, you buy from the same guy that sells cigarettes from his trunk.", "Date": "November 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "VERY VERY HAPPY", "Author": "Shawn", "ReviewID": "R2MSB4N3WRZ4CD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I bought this TV off an Amazon merchant for much less then retail. The picture is TREMENDOUS, more so when hooked up through the color stream. the HD broadcast on this TV are breath taking. I would strongly pick this set over any other. My questions is where can I find a DVI cable for this set?", "Date": "April 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Meh.", "Author": "dgatwood", "ReviewID": "R2XCQA1VPIQD9F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's an okay TV set, as projection TVs go.  Although it theoretically handles 1080i, it's too fuzzy to usefully perceive much more than 720p in practice.The biggest problem I have with this TV is actually a significant design flaw.  Apparently, Toshiba thought they would be cute and put the remote control sensor inside the TV, behind the projection screen.  That's fine if you're using a remote control from across the room.  However, if you want to set up any sort of hardwired remote control system (e.g. a computer controlling all the hardware in your entertainment system), you're kind of stuck because any placement of the IR transmitter that actually works also blocks part of the the screen.  The only real option appears to involve drilling a hole in the TV and putting the transmitter inside somewhere.  This falls squarely under the category of \"clever tricks that seemed like a good idea at the time\".  Guess it's time to drill, baby, drill.  *sigh*", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "14000 hrs and still going!!!!!", "Author": "J. loeffler \"shagster69\"", "ReviewID": "R2A0I2H5WPUI0E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow the guy in the last review was an idiot to say the least. Rex stores are a dodgy company however. They have like a 2 week return policy and after that it is only store credit. But who cares now they are no longer in business in my area. The 2 stores that were here are closed. Anyway, Not that anybody will read this now that this tv is obsolete but this is a great tv with great sound and picture. It has served me well for over 14000 hrs now with no end in site. I HOPE!!!

I own many aprtments, and had a tennant move out in the middle of the night and left some nice things that more than compensated me for the rent and the holes in the walls.  Among the items was this glorious TV.  The only thing missing is the remote.  Somewhat hard to program without it, but otherwise a great piece of electronics.

First off, know that you have to assemble this television.  What?  Are you kidding you ask?  NO!  You have to assemble this television.  I bought the tv from my local Rex electronics store and I took it home expecting to be able to watch it that night, but it was in the box in pieces.  I called the salesman at the store and asked him what had happened, I figured it was an error, but he said that was the reason the price on the tv was so low.  Toshiba is cutting labor costs by putting the tv parts in a box and I have to assemble it like prefab furniture.  Un-Freaking-Believable!  I have to figure out this diagram with lenses and mirrors and somehow manage to put the whole thing together with my own tools.  I finally got it put together and everything is captioned in Japanese.  The audio works fine, but there are Japanese characters all over the screen that, as best as I can tell, are subtitles.  They do not appear during commercials, only during a network broadcast so I can only guess they are subtitles as I don't understand Japanese and cannot imagine what else they could be.  Again a phone call to the Rex and again the standard \"you got the tv cheap, what do you expect?\"  Lastly, I cannot watch anything after 8 p.m. on this tv.  If I try to watch tv after this hour, it will play for 2 or 3 minutes and then a message comes up on the screen, in english this time, suggesting that \"It is late.  Why don't you spend time with your family?\" and then it shuts off.  I have no family.  What else do I have besides television to keep me company?  I tried taking the television back and the people at the store told me that because I had assembled the tv poorly, they would not take it back.  I am now stuck with the tv.  I have denied the charge on my credit card and called Toshiba to see if they will assist in this matter as I have been completely screwed.
