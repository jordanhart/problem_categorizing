{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Defective Item received from ONE STOP SHOP", "Author": "Zanisha", "ReviewID": "R1IW0O7MCQDA53", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this item from One Stop Shop. Item was packaged very securely and shipped on time. The unit I received was defective though, as I am getting video and no audio. I'm getting a scratching sound instead. I tested the unit on two seperate occassions with the same result.The problem is that I do not live in the US. Vendor promised to refund cost but in addition to the skybox charge of $195US to have the item shipped here, they want me to pay extra to ship it back to the US. I do not know what this would cost and vendor has not stated whether I would be refunded these extra costs.One Stop Shop has not been very helpful in arriving at a resolution. I already stated to them that they are free to collect the unit at my home as I am unwilling to spend extra on additional shipping when I'm not guaranteed of a refund. If they are selling defective goods, they should have proper arrangements to cover returns from abroad.My advice - do not buy this item from this vendor. In fact I would go the extra to advise DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ONE STOP SHOP as they may be selling defective goods and you'll be stuck with the headache of returns with little or no help from them.The worst part about this entire experience was this....when I received the item and realized it was defective, I emailed the company and got no response for over 4 hours, but i did get a call 5 minutes after I posted a negative Seller's feedback. Their rep assured me I would be refunded all charges and I even told her on more than 6 occassions that I do not live in the US. She said it was no problem and requested that I remove my negative feedback. I told her that i will not do so until after I am refunded, yet she insisted that I take down the review. I did so after she assured me that i will be fully refunded, with me again telling her that I do not live in the US. Upon reflection, it seems they were more concerned about taking down the negative review than resolving my issue. So I was duped into taking down the review and now I cannot repost. Eventually they stopped responding to my emails so I'm stuck with a defective TV.Again I emphasise, DO NOT BUY FROM ONE STOP SHOP!! Both their products and customer service are terrible!!!!ONE STOP SHOP SUCKS!!!", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Sanyo 26\" Class Lcd/dvd 720p 60hz, Dp26671", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41U5OrRgEBL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007GI0YFK"}}
