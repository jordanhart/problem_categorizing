The Philips 32PF7321D fits the bill.  The picture is first rate.  The sound is very good.  (Use the personal settings to boost the high end on the built in EQ menu for greater clarity). The remote control is decent.OUTSTANDING SD (Standard Definition) reception - absolutely the very best of any brand I looked at - at any price.It runs cool and uses much less electricity (only 140 watts) than Plasma or CRTs with no worry of image burn-in OR bulb burn-out as on LCD or DLP projection.My first one out of the box did have on-off issues.  I returned it .  The second set has been perfect so far.UPDATE:  We have now owned this set for 10 months and are thoroughly enjoying it.  We have also connected the headphone output jack on the back to an external amplifier with bigger speakers.  Great AV experience.", "Date": "August 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Buy this TV if your looking for a Great LCD HDTV", "Author": "M.  Morrison", "ReviewID": "R3LUK4O27IYYCG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV for about a week.  I spent hours researching LCD TV's and then watched them side by side at Best Buy, Costco, and Sam's Club My research showed that LCD's in whole are not able to reproduce blacks like plasma can, but they are now as bright if not brighter than plasma.  This TV's picture can easily be seen in a brightly lit room, no need to close blinds or dim lights.This TV has great contrast and reproduces blacks as well as any LCD TV I have looked at.  Many of the LCD's I viewed in the store seemed to have washed out color especially in the blacks.This TV has a great picture in Standard broadcast and has an exceptional picture in high definition.  Many HD TV's do not do well in up resing  a Standard broadcast to fit the high resolution screen.  When comparing LCD HDTV in the stores be sure to look at both HD programs and standard definition broadcast. This TV does a great job with playing a Standard broadcast.This TV produces one of the best pictures I've seen in an LCD and is almost equal to my 42\" Toshiba HD plasma which produces 3D like pictures in HD.When I was setting up this TV in it's \"Installation\" program when I ran the auto station search program function a warning came up that it may take 30 minutes to run, to may surprise mine ran 5 minutes or more before it started reporting found stations - at it's conclusion after about 20 minutes it reported it found 261 digital stations and 80 analog stations.  After completing the programming and scanning through my cable service channels I was pleasantly surprised to find that about 10 or more of my stations could be viewed in High Definition without the use of a Cable HD box from my cable provider.This set has a USB port that can be used for showing JPG images and album slide shows; it also can be used to update the TV's software.  I went to the Philips USA website and downloaded to a USB flash drive new updated software for my TV that included 4 software updates to my TV even though I just bought the set last week.Pro's to this TV - As good if not the best picture for a LCD TV for both HD and Standard TV. Low power consumption 140 watts, lighter weight than plasma (one person can move and install this TV), does not suffer from burn in as easily as plasma, has an HDTV ATSC tuner that allows me to watch HDTV without the cable company's HD tuner (ComCast is my cable provider and a friend of mine that has this same TV with Insight cable reports also getting HDTV without the cable company tuner), ability to download and update operating software through the USB port and a home computer.Con's - Only one HDMI port, remote is not universally programmable and only operates Philips products (Don't be mislead because it has selections for DVD/R, CBL, TV, VCR AUX)and the remote is somewhat confusing to use in spite of some color coding to improve ease of use. This TV maybe $100 to $200 more then a price leader TV like Vizio, but the picture quality is well worth the added cost.Philips claims that - \"The Philips dynamic contrast enhancer uses video processing and unique dimming backlight technology. This delivers deep rich black levels with increased detail. The dimming backlight increases the contrast up to 5 times, and at the same time improves the viewing angle.\" Perhaps this is why the picture seems to me to be so much better than many of the other LCD's.At the time I wrote this review this TV could be bought for several hundred dollars less from Sam's Club then Amazon, but I would expect Amazon will adjust their pricing as LCD prices continue to fall.", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Brilliant HDTV", "Author": "Jose Hernandez \"Roberto Hernandez\"", "ReviewID": "R6V0BZPP3TTXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV a few weeks ago and so far so good.  The resolution is incredibly clear, specially with HD channels.  I have an XBOX 360 and I was amazed the first time I plugged it in to this TV, not only because of the crystal-clear image, but also because of the loud and clear sound.  So if you're looking for an affordable TV but also want to get the most out of it, I recommend you buy this one.  It's Not cheap or expensive like a Sony or Samsung and you're probably going to get about the same image quality", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great LCD TV with exceptional picutre quality", "Author": "Jiunn \"Jiunn\"", "ReviewID": "R71AGNOM41JBT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned this TV for two weeks.  All I have to say about this LCD TV is wonderful. I did a research on which brand to go with.  Originally it's either Panasonic, or Sharp the top dog.  But I found this one with only two or three user reviews, there is no professional review out there, and dig into more what it offer.I need at least 3 sets of AV input and it has. One with S and one with HDMI.  It also has dynamic contrast control, pixel plus, ...etc.The picture quality is so brigh and good.  Even we are watching regular channel, like SiFi and Food, it looks very like HDTV images.  My wife like it because the food is so 3D and real.I am glad that I buy the right one with very good price.  I strongly recommend that you look into this TV.", "Date": "January 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent buy!", "Author": "Torian", "ReviewID": "R1MZLD49Z1TBOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this television after extensive research from the Sams Club website for 750.00 plus shipping...no tax.  Is that a steal or what!This was my first HDTV purchase...and I promised myself that I wasn't going to get stuck with something for years that I wouldn't be happy with.  I did tons of research and found that there were many low quality LCD HDTVs out there that cost more than what I spent on this (walk through the Walmart HDTV selection and you will see what I'm referring too)What sold me on this television?  Aside from the brightness, constrast ratios, and refresh times...which are all excellent...the SOUND ON THIS TV IS AWESOME!  This HDTV comes with 2x15w channel speakers that just sound superb...especially with the HDMI connection.My only gripe is probably that this only comes with one HDMI connection.  HDMI is the only way to go these days if you want a pure digital experience.  When I upgrade to an HD DVD player...I will have to run my two HDMI signals (one from cable/one from dvd) to a receiver, and then run a single HDMI cable to the TV.Aside from this single issue, which really isn't too major, I couldn't be happier with this purchase.I've only seen this television listed online, with Sam's having by far the best price (Amazon thinks this TV is worth almost 1100.00)...and no where else...not at Circuit City, Walmart, Best Buy, Target, or at any of the Sams clubs on site.  I expect the reason for this is that this TV at this price would undercut everything else they are selling.If you can find it, jump on this baby!", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Phillips--The manufacturer to avoid", "Author": "F.
