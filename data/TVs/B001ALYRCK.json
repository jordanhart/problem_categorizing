{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb TV, exceptional value for money", "Author": "S Sudarshan", "ReviewID": "R1L7QJK10DUMW1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV after a lot of research and deliberation. I saw the LN46A540 at Costco and I liked it. But at the same time I realized that this TV didn't have the 120Hz feature. Prior to that I had talked to the sales guys at Circuit City and Best Buy and they had told me that Auto motion plus was really worth spending my money on. So when a friend of mine bought the LN46A650, I borrowed it from him for a few days. I thenwent to Costco, bought this TV and put both next to each other in my house and played the same blu-ray movie on both.Honestly there was no perceptible difference in the picture quality. The blacks on both were almost equally dark and the colors equally rich. In some very fast moving scenes, the judder elimination was slightly noticeable on the 650 but that was only when I viewed the movie from a distance of 4 feet or less.From a distance of 15 feet (where I normally view it) I didn't notice any difference at all. I concluded that it was not worth spending an additional $800 (Best Buy's price) on the 650.There are also some things I hate about the 650.The remote control - The rotating dial sucks. Try navigating through TV menu using it and you'll be as frustrated and furious as I was.Firmware issue - The 540 did not have the firmware issue that plagues the 650 series. With the 650 it was so frustrating to find that a TV, brand new out of the box was turning itself off at regular intervals. I can't understand why Samsung can't apply the patch even before shipping the TV. The firmware problem has been around for a while now.I spent $1499 (after the $200 discount) on the 540 from Costco and I'm very happy with it.The only reason why I gave a 4 star rating is because the sound quality is lousy. But the 650 was no better either. I was getting better sound quality on my $600 32 inch Sharp. Samsung should really do something to improve the sound quality on their 500 and 600 series since they are charging so much for them.", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Incredible picture", "Author": "techygirl", "ReviewID": "R20S8KANZW20PZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the Samsung LN46A540 a week ago and I am more than happy with it. I struggled between this one and the 650 but I don't like the TOC red on the 6 & 7 series. The 540 has the same ultra clear panel as the 6 & 7 series but is a 60hz with 35,000 dynamic contrast ratio compared to 120 hz & 50,000 on the 6 & 7 series. The difference is not noticable to me and the piano black case is elegant. For the best quality picture get a HDMI box from your cable provider. No problem with the glass panel in my well lit living room, it has an incredible picture. Got mine on sale, sweet deal!", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN46A540 LCD HDTV", "Author": "Pauli", "ReviewID": "R1WG594GFBVERU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this TV for one week now and all I can tell you is that Im gladthat I purchased it.I looked at the Sony,Sharp,LG and Toshiba models atnumerous stores and the Samsung looked better than all of them.At home it performs beautifully and with the blu-ray player it is extraordinary.A few family members own the sony KD series and they admit that the Samsungs picture is better...so there you have it.All I can tell you is to take one home and see for yourself.Oh and let me add this... mybrother in law even bought his 46in Sony over and we set it up nextto my Samsung LN46A540......HA! THE PICTURE IS REALLY SUPERIOR ON THE SAMSUNG!  I am so proud of myself now..Hope you get the chance to try one for yourself..............Pauli", "Date": "August 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Highly recommended", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3OYM7RWY3KMHV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV after a lot of research and am very happy with the product. I love the deep blacks and the rich colors in the picture. Sound quality is average, but probably not enough to lower the rating of this TV. Note that the screen is glossy, and it does reflect light from the room ! Overall a very solid TV, and highly recommended !", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "a really good TV", "Author": "Standingtree", "ReviewID": "R2PEAO5A97Z18J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Costco online this Thanksgiving.Just got it today and have it installed.I have to say it is definitely an amazing TV.It has the USB input some of the higher series have.Also, by comparing it to A650, I would say that the 60Hz is actually not bad at all.I am so glad to get it and totally thrilled.", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Looks good to me!", "Author": "Winona in Tacoma \"Winonatac\"", "ReviewID": "R3CI8ZHDGA8FJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before buying and HD TV also.
