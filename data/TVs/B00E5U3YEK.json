(If it doesn't say \"Amazon Verified Purchaser\" you're dealing with a clown (and probably a poor one at that).)  I'm staring at it (the TV, not the clowns (or my dingus)) now; it's staring back.

I assumed Bill and Warren were just exaggerating to have a laugh at my expense. Needless to say, I was a fool. As soon as my pilot touched us down at LG Headquarters I could feel an energy in the air and felt shocks up and down my spine. I would have dismissed it as coincidence if it wasn't exactly the same as the stories Melinda had told me about the first time she touched it. The LG Executives greeted me and their staff carried us into the showroom. There I beheld the finest creation of mankind - surpassing The Colosseum in it's architectural elegance, the rolling hills of Ireland in it's pristine beauty, and the International Space Station in it's technical advancement. Immediately I knew that I had encountered the means to fulfill my divine destiny. It was at exactly this moment I noticed my vision was blurred. Reaching to put on my glasses, I realized I was already wearing them. Just looking at the stunning image quality of this television had cured my severe nearsightedness. Needless to say, I immediately motioned for my assistant to bring in the crates of gold. As we lifted off I was filled with ecstasy, envisioning the years we would spend together, unlocking the mysteries of the heavens. Upon reaching my manor, I had my staff move the television into my 4th floor study. I had it connected to my computer with my Diamond HDMI Digital Audio/Video Cable W/ Ethernet Connection 5 meters and, to my surprise, the energy from this marvel of technology coursed through the cable and transformed my computer, causing it to become a mere 4mm thick, allowing it to have room for a quad-SLI setup, 384GB of RAM, a 10x1GB SSD raid array, and dual Xeon processors in a space which previously would have been too small for even the smallest of computers. It was at this moment that I realized it was unethical to keep this joy to myself and knew in my heart that, despite most people being uneducated peasants, I must spread the word on the wondrous joy that is this TV. This brings me to you; It is here I spread my message to the masses and bring you the un-censored truth: You don't even understand what life is until you own this television. If you want true happiness I recommend that you immediately stop being poor and become rich so you can purchase this television. I realize everyone has their own motivations and I never understood why so many people would choose to be poor, but I can assure you, whatever your reasons are, they aren't worth not having this television.P.S. As a side note, it does appear that the mystical powers of this television are limited in a few areas. I exposed the Jacksonville Jaguars to this television and they still appear unable to make it to the Super Bowl. Keep this in mind if you intend on buying this television instead of a new stadium.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "The next level", "Author": "Bob Crossley \"Gottsmack\"", "ReviewID": "R3PX6CHQMFIJV0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to literally sell my children to raise the funds to buy this portal to the next plane of consciousness but all my fears evaporated like morning fog when I beheld the awesomeness that is......this.
