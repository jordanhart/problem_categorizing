I have had it for over a year, and I have had no problems with it.  The picture is clear, and the sound quality is great.  It is small and does not take up a lot of room.  It is also really light and easy to move.  I would reccommend this TV to anyone.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "D. Hoyle", "ReviewID": "R2SD7MA296FVJ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this TV 24 April to replace another brand I bought on 22 April.This tv was so much easier to set up, though lining up the tabs to attach the base should be easier than it is.It scanned in all channels when first turned on.  Picture is bright, clear, and you can change the picture shape if you want.  The stand raises it up just enough to be comfortable to watch.  My previous tv was so low it felt like I was looking at the floor.The Remote has large, easy to use control buttons.  They work reliably with no fuss.  There are channels I don't want or need, this tv is easy to set up to skip those unwanted channels.Overall I like it very much, easy to set up, bright clear picture, quality sound to my ears.  Definetly recommend it.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001Q9A8GU"}}
