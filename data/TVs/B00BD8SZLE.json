Matheny", "ReviewID": "RECHC2FPG0E6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to admit that I've been completely blown away by how fast flat screen technology has evolved in the last few years.Just 5 years ago, the smallest bezel TV I could find was a 52\" Mitsubishi LCD; and, now I was able to purchase this 55\" Samsung LED that looks small when hanging in the same cabinet - even with the 3\" larger screen!When I first set this TV up, I was initially impressed with the bright colors; but, there were 3 obvious problems:- There was an almost unnoticeable 'glitch' that would occur fairly frequently.  I tried to tell myself I was just being picky; but, it happened often enough to be irritating.- The picture was absolutely crystal clear (like looking out a window) - but the colors made everything look like a soap opera.  (At least, that's what I thought of.)- The picture looked great when the room was bright; but, it got a hazy/grey look when the room was dark.I started playing with the settings and lucked into a fix for the glitch pretty quickly.  There's a setting called 'Auto Motion Plus' under 'Picture Options'.  I played around with it for a bit and realized the glitch completely disappeared when this is set to 'Off'.The problem with the 'soap opera' look was resolved by messing with the color settings; and, the most important change ended up being to reduce the brightness & LED backlight settings.The haziness took a few days - and I almost reached a point where I was going to return the TV.  Fortunately, that was also resolved by turning off the 'Eco Sensor'.  The reason it took longer to find is because it isn't located under picture settings - instead, it's hidden in the 'System/Eco Solution' menu...Anyway, I have to say that I'm 100% satisfied now - and absolutely blown away by the amazing picture quality!  I was tempted to reduce this to a 4 star review because I think the settings I mentioned should probably be defaults for most people; but, I'm sure Samsung has their own reasons.Overall, I would highly recommend this TV if you're looking for a great LED TV![*** UPDATE 8/10/2013 ***]I've continued messing with the settings on this TV and have found that the Eco-Sensor actually can be a nice feature.  Instead of turning it off, I started using the 'Minimum Brightness' sub-setting that forces the TV to stay above a specific brightness level.When the room was at it's darkest level (which is how it normally is when watching movies), I set the minimum brightness level on the Eco-Sensor so it looks good.  The great thing about that is the picture is now bright enough during the day and doesn't get the 'hazy' look at night.Anyway, I figured I would throw that one additional tip in here from my experimentation.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Three TVs enter. One TV leaves.", "Author": "Chris G", "ReviewID": "R2CSR28S4PX89Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Note: to skip my long-winded story and read only about the FH6030, go to \"TV #3\" below)***Background: I had a 42\" Panasonic PX600u plasma for seven years and loved it. But the set started to lose its luster, and I was tired of lowering the blinds during the day to watch TV. Most plasmas sold seven years ago did not have the best anti-glare coatings. So, I decided to go with an LED, knowing I would have to make some sacrifices in picture quality, but would in turn gain a set that was much brighter and performed significantly better in daylight.***The Goal: 50-55\" with a great picture for around $1000. I didn't care about 3D or Smart features. I have an AppleTV and PlayStation that handle the Smart features. Unless your TV will be mounted somewhere that can't accommodate any additional devices, there's no need to ever use a TV's built in Netflix, Hulu, etc. They are horrible at it compared to AppleTV, Roku, Xbox/PS3, etc.I did not want to have to go through three TVs  to get one I liked. But if I was spending $1000 for something I would hope to have for ten years, I was going to be picky.***TV #1: What sucks about buying a TV is that you can't judge the picture in stores because the settings are all jacked up and you're viewing under florescent lighting. Your best bet is to do a ton of research online. But what I discovered is that many TV manufacturers have different panel makers for the same model, and those panels can perform very differently. CNET may rave about one model, and you can get the same model with a different panel and have poor result. With that said, I found a great deal for a 50\" 2012 Samsung ES6500. Reviews online were mixed, ranging from stellar (Consumer Reports) to just OK (PC Mag). Given Amazon's fantastic return policy, I ordered it. The picture wasn't bad. However, the details in dark scenes were horrible. In addition, this TV just wasn't that bright -- the main reason I switched from plasma to LED. The TV also exhibited some pretty bad \"clouding\" and \"flashlighting\" (terms I learned on AVS Forum when I found a thread full of people who hate this TV). Apparently, this is common for many edge-lit LEDs, but this model is much worse than most. I gave it about a week and returned the set.***TV #2: Even though it had no reviews, everyone loves Sony. I took a risk on a 50\" 2013 Sony R550a. The problems I had with this Sony made me miss the previous Samsung:- It was even dimmer than the Samsung (and I had the Eco settings off)- No matter what I did, I couldn't get the picture to \"pop\" and give me any sort of wow factor- Not as important, but the Sony was pretty ugly in person and the chrome stand and bottom bezel created annoying reflections- It did not handle fast motion in a hockey game well- It's a semi-matte screen, but still not very good in a bright room- And most of all, when the camera panned during hockey, soccer or golf, it had this annoying cloudy effect. After doing some research, I found out this is called a dirty scree effect (DSE).I gave the Sony more than a week, but just couldn't get past the picture issues so I returned it. Also, I don't know if this means anything, but apparently the new Sony models are made with LG Panels.***TV #3: I read great early reviews on Samsung's 2013 TVs, so I took another risk and ordered the 55\" FH6030. I've had it now for five days and LOVE it. Here is how it compares to the previous two TVs:- Very mild dirty screen effect. I have to look for it to see it. With the Sony R550a, I could not escape it. I don't recall if the ES6500 had DSE as I didn't even know what it was then, and it didn't stand out like the Sony- Much more uniform and has less flash-lighting and clouding compared to the ES6500. It's also better than the R550a in this department, but the Sony wasn't that bad to begin with. It's important to note that the FH6030 is direct-lit unlike the previous two TVs that were edge-lit. This makes the cabinet slightly thicker, but typically allows for a more uniform picture.- Much better shadow detail and performance in dark scenes than the ES6500, but not quite as good as the Sony R550a- Much brighter than both the ES6500 and R550a- Handles glare much better than the R550a and slightly better than the ES6500- The picture \"pops\" far more than the R550a- Off-angle viewing is not the greatest and worse than both the R550a and ES6500- No issues in handling fast motion. It's better than the R550a and pretty much the same as the ES6500I'm giving it five stars because I'm factoring price in. But if I'm rating the TV without factoring in cost, then the poor off-angle viewing and less than impressive detail in very dark scenes would make me drop it to four.Still, I'm happy enough with this TV to write my first Amazon review. After being very frustrated from having to return two prior TVs, I feel somewhat victorious for finally landing a set I love.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 3D TV", "Author": "Frankl8593", "ReviewID": "RRSEBJ9BBW0IU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just picked this up a few days ago. Since this is a new 2013 model, there is conflicting information on websites as to whether this tv supports 3D or not.  It does.  Visit Samsung's website for full details.  This FH6030 is pretty much the same as last years EH6030, but does not have the 3D glasses included and is at a lower retail price.Wanted a 3D TV but had no use for Smart features (streaming Netflix, Amazon, etc) as my TV is hooked up to my HTPC. This is one of the very few TV's with 3D and no Smart features. And it's priced accordingly. Easy to set up and fairly light if you are doing a wall mounting. Picture is good as expected with any Samsung product and has multiple setup options. Connects to the internet but the connection is used only for software updates.  Like so many others, I really don't care for the Auto Motion or LED Motion Plus features that smooth the picture.  Others call this the \"Soap Opera\" effect, but what it really does, to my eyes, is reduce sharpness and blur out/soften/dim the picture.  I just turn them off.No 3D glasses are included, but they are less than 20 dollars a pair. The correct glasses to get are the Samsung SSG-5100GB 3D Active Glasses. Pair them with the set (they are bluetooth) and you're good to go. The 2D to 3D conversion is surprisingly good. The 3D is outstanding.If you want a nice 55 inch TV with 3D and don't need to stream from the TV, this is the one to get.http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SSG-5100GB-3D-Active-Glasses/dp/B00BIP816Q/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1370206449&sr;=8-3&keywords;=3d+glasses+for+Samsung", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Factory settings look terrible.  Looks good after custom adjustment.", "Author": "M. J. Bernadett", "ReviewID": "RI7SM9RWM48OU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We use this TV for 3 different content sources:1.  SD A/V from a Comcast cable box.2.  HD QAM-in-the-clear for local channels.  Update 9/20/13 NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING THESE!3.  PS3 via HDMI for games, Netflix, DVD and Blu RayI was really worried when we first fired this set up.  The SD A/V looked terrible, and the HD local channels didn't look a whole lot better.  People's faces were washed out, flat and blurry.I discovered I need to TURN OFF DYNAMIC CONTRAST, and crank the contrast DOWN.  In general, turn OFF all the settings that pretend to be smart in how they trade off one thing for another.  Things with 'Filtering', 'Auto', or 'Reduction' in the name are all enabled from the factory, but you probably don't need all of them, or you may be able to adjust most of them to a lower level.With Dynamic Contrast off, an adjustment procedure that worked well for us:1. Do this in the evening or in a dimly lit room.2. Set backlight to a mid to low value like 9.3. Set contrast to 50.4. Set sharpness to a low value like 40.5. Adjust brightness so that absolute black in the picture is really black, with no hint of gray.  You may need to switch channels to find a movie with dark scenes, or put up a news channel that has black in the crawl, like Bloomberg.  You can switch the picture size to bring up black bars to compare with.  Set it just to the point where the hint of gray is gone.6. Now adjust the backlight to get the picture brightness right for your lighting conditions.  From here on, leave 'brightness' alone, and use backlight to adjust for different room lighting.I believe 50 is 'unity' for contrast, i.e. a transfer function slope of 1.  Adjust according to your tastes, but be aware that 100 is the extreme high setting, not 'normal' or unity.  Don't expect 'sharpness' to do much, unless you're watching 20th century soap operas or an old episode of 'fawlty towers'.  Also, the MPEG filtering looks better on 'low' for us.For the A/V input, you may find that 'game mode' gives you a better picture, simply because it bypasses some of the 'smart' processing that doesn't work so well for SD (480i).  Game mode is selected elsewhere in the menus, under System Settings.Fortunately there is a separate memory store of all these settings for each input.My recommendation is to go through all the inputs you'll be using, start with all the extra features turned off, then add in just enough of the feature that's most important to you and go from there.Most people don't like the 'Soap Opera Effect' that Auto Motion Plus gives you on fictional content like movies and dramas.  Since it removes the 'judder' and 'motion blur' that you ordinarily get with 24fps material, it tends to make the content look less like a movie and more like a soap opera shot at 29.97fps (59.94i).  In HD it actually makes things look more real, so it makes a movie look like a bunch of people walking around a movie set.  It takes away quite a bit of the drama or fiction 'feel' of the 24fps we're used to, and reveals details that the director didn't necessarily intend.No problems with 3D from the PS3.  Clear, accurate and lifelike.  Two thumbs up on that.Bought mine on sale at Best Buy for the same price I see here.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent value on a top-tier brand TV.", "Author": "Kenneth B. Kaczor", "ReviewID": "R1YB0YY5IXKF4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At the $700 sale price tag, it was probably the best value for a 3D LCD TV at the time, with a fantastic picture sitting at front center although lackluster off-viewing angles.The 3D is very good.  Many people bash 3D and call it a gimmick--which it often is--but done right it really adds to the experience.There are no Smart features on this TV, and it is not wifi-capable.  HOWEVER, you CAN connect it via ethernet to update it if one ever becomes available (I doubt it--this seems more like a yearly value model) and--this surprised me--you CAN stream content over your network, and it apparently even can see my plex server without any special configuration (!).  And as another reviewer helpfully pointed out, it does play MKVs. NOTE, if you are using this to connect to a PC, I could not force a 120hz input.  It is no replacement for a 120hz monitor as most TVs, like this one, cannot accept a 120hz signal.  It is also VERY important that you tell the TV that this is a PC by pressing SOURCE on the remote, selecting the input, then pressings TOOLS and naming it as \"PC.\" This does more than just name your input--it is actually a specific PC mode that disables all the unnecessary crap and displays a proper image to the PC.  You will also need to change your picture size by pressing \"P. Size\" on your remote and selecting \"screen fit.\"  Your image will likely appear either too large for the screen or not take up the entire TV screen, in which case you actually have to go to your video card's settings and changing the overscan/underscan until it is just right.It should also be mentioned that the input delay is a bit noticeable even after game mode and PC mode are selected, when compared to monitors.  This should have the greatest effect on online twitch-shooter games.  It will likely not be a factor in most games.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "5 for the video, 3 for the audio", "Author": "whwh", "ReviewID": "R2O5VE37Y668G3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the 55\" version of this 3DTV. Video is wonderful. It's like looking through glass. But the video is not quite so good out of the box. So I would suggest tinkering with all settings. - There is the Picture category of options, but then there are other video-related options in the System category of options.It seems like the key things to adjust is to turn Eco-Mode off and never turn on the Motion Lighting.And there are 4 settings, Dynamic, Standard, Natural, and Movie. These differ in how they are preset but they also differ slightly in image and light focus or in how the light diffuses over objects in a scene. Everything else being equal, color settings, warm or cold, brightness settings, etc, going from one setting to the other will seem as different as changing light sources from a campfire or a incandescent light bulb to a flourescent light bulb or LED.For my viewing, the best starting point is \"Movie\" and modifying from there. Movie is the most natural for both the colors and the light focus, and for all of its Pros has the most minimal Cons. Dynamic, OTOH, is a sharp and vivid when modified properly but ultimately suffers too much from \"black crush\" where darks and shadows tend to look indistinguishable from each other. \"Natural\" is pre-set pretty good but is horrible in the way that it handles scene changes (brightness levels change a split second before the scene does). Also, in Natural and Dynamic, you cannot change Advance Options.Here's an example qualia I get from this TV in Movie: Looking at wooden floors in videos is like looking at wooden floors in real life. The same goes for hair- you can see each strand. You'll see every damp crack in concrete sidewalks or flooring. You'll even see water stains on windows. It's like looking through glass, great details, great balance between light and dark.My settings in Movie:Backlight 19Contrast 100Brightness 55Sharpness 55Color 69Tint  45Dynamic Contrast OffBlack Tone OffFlesh Tone 0Color Space NativeWhite Balance R-Offset 10 G-Offset 10 B-Offset 10- The rest at default 25Gamma -2.Picture Options: Color Tone Standard, Auto Motion Plus - Custom (4 for Blur Reduction 5 Judder)When used as a PC monitor make sure you calibrate using the \"calibrate display\" program native to Windows. It's usually located at C:\\Windows\\System32\\dccw.exe. I use the above settings and then calibrate. Also make sure to change desktop icon fonts and web browser fonts, as the font will be too thin to see comfortably with sharpness turned up.(Important edit: Whenever you change resolution on your computer, the Samsung TV automatically switches to PC mode; you lose about half of the options avaiable, and the picture looks awful. Go to source and then tools and then change the source to Game; this way you get back a fuller picture. If the PC screen doesn't line up with the TV screen, select \"Screen Fit\" option in the Screen Adjustment category. In PC mode, the Samsung TV is too dark, or way too bright, with no viewing middle ground, and with a lot of grey in between.)The \"Soap Opera\" effect? I kind of like it, although a better term for it would be the \"Green Screen effect\" - since when you watch it always seems as though actors are in front of a green screen with a digital environment added after the fact, which is often the reality anyway. Almost reminds me of the cut-scenes used in older SCiFi video games featuring live action and live actors within fake, CG, environments. This effect can be turned off so it's no big deal, like it or not. You can also vary its intensity.(Postedit 2: I am in love with the above feature. Take full advantage of the Soap Opera effect, by choosing custom. The reward is a life-like viewing experience. The active variable behind the SO Effect is Judder Reduction, and what it does is move the background with the foreground  in the vertical direction wherever it sees fit (kind of like the way Youtube videos have a post-processing option to remove all shaking in a video, but much better and much subtler). Too little JR and you get a lot of tiny movement, and too much judder reduction, and you get a lot of wide, sweeping, overall motion with not a lot of stability. The idea is to get it at just the right intensity where the viewing correction closely emulates that of looking at things in real life, with the eyeballs moving, with the head moving. I have the Blur Reduction set to 4 and the Judder Reduction set to 5. This seems to be the best combination.)What I don't like about the TV is the audio. I have a soundbar so that takes care of that. But the Samsung speakers really do leave a lot to be desired when compared to the speakers on other TVs. There's also a considerable lag I notice in the audio when I hook the TV up to my computer. The lag goes away when I have use my soundbar, but buyers would do well to consider this.The form factor isn't the best. You want the best? Spend 500-1000 more and buy the TVs with glass bezels, chrome pod stands, and that are  2inches deep. This TV isn't quite as sexy, although the bezel is thin.Finally, I have tried out the 3D. It's a good feature and adds depth to 2D. However, I'm not crazy about it.Overall, this TV is awesome for the price. A 3D, LED backlit TV with none of the expensive (and useless) SmartTV excesses - I say useless because I have my PC hooked up to the TV  anyway, which would make it an EinsteinTV.

I'm a movie nut job. I know, many people are, but you don't understand; I'm crazy nuts and ever since the 3D craze started, I've been giddy like a child that Hollywood was bringing it back and doing it well. For that same amount of time I've been salivating over 3D-tv's that I couldn't afford and it was leaving knots in my stomach. I was literally obsessed with owning a 3D tv. Financially, it wasn't an option and it made it almost impossible to bear. I'm a single father and caring for my son was taking all of my discretionary income.  That ended with the Samsung 40\" 3D tv.Samsung is the #1 tv brand on the market for a reason; or at least one of the tops. They are smart enough to realize that people aren't buying 3D tvs because their too pricey. Right after the market told everybody to buy HD-tv's, and people did, they said, \"Now buy 3D tvs\".  Well.... we just bought HD-TV's.... now we have to buy something else in order to get 3D!?  People wanted 3D-tv's but the government was busy destroying the economy and giving tax dollars to terrorist countries to fund Al-queda and Bin Laden. I'm rambling, but this is all relevant.  Bottom line... HERE IT IS.  Finally, Samsung has delivered a remarkable 3D-tv with a jaw-dropping price.You may think, \"it must suck.\"  You'd be wrong. The trick is that it isn't a 'smart-tv'. Well, in this day and age of PS3, PS4 and Xbox, you don't have to have a 'smart' tv to have a smart-tv. Playstation and Xbox do all that, so buying a 3D-tv with smart capability and owning a PS or Xbox is an oxymoron and a waste of money. This TV has a brilliant picture and a brilliant 3D that after watching for weeks now, I believe is even better than what you would experience at the movie theater and I've had 4 other people say the same thing to me.Samsung has made a brilliant move here. In a world of hundreds of millions of people who already have smart capability with gaming systems, they delivered a brilliant 3D-tv at a jaw-dropping low price. This is it. Grab it. I assure you. It is well worth it. Be smart. Just because your hair-dresser is cheap doesn't mean she's bad. Just because your neighbor kid wants $30 to shovel your driveway, doesn't mean he's gonna do a $30 job.  The Samsung 40\" 3D is a steal. No, the glasses don't come with it, but LOOK AT THAT PRICE... you can buy Samsung SSG-5100GB 3D active glasses for $15 each. It does have a little bit of a glare in sunny room and it does take some tweaking to suit your liking, but that is nothing compared to the benefits. Most notably, it took me a while to find a setting called L/R image & R/L image. The 3D didn't look good; like the background was more prominent, but when I switched this to R/L.... all look like it was supposed to and the party began.Have fun!!

This may seem like a strange comparison, however consider that even modest LED panels deliver pretty good to fabulous results when fed by GPU/CPU engines delivering entertainment in the form of Games and Motion Picture releases.The 3D Feature is there, like the sliding glass door that greets you're mug on occasion before it is opened. It converts your 2D into 3D, I think. The Gossamer thin chassis, like fine linen, is incredibly light. Initial setup is easy, however mine booted into the default \"horrible picture quality mode\"? i.e. the ambient light sensor determined I was not blind then proceeded to reduce picture quality sufficiently to cause blurred vision.Xbox Live - Yowza!, Netflix, Hulu Plus Amazon Prime? Yep, Glorious.What is not convenient - Game Mode, which is buried and hidden like an embarrassing rash, deep in the forgotten bowels of the menu system that otherwise does what menu systems do, without being too annoying. Literally the last menu option (under SYSTEM) in a row of options nowhere near the usual picture tweak options, leading to a submenu option as if to suggest --- Seriously? You're going to play a game? Yes....eventually...The Energy Star Option is there and upon first view is terrible, consistent with the industry practice of making consumers suffer to save some planet warming energy. It's a dumb practice that should change. Start with the ambient light sensor which has not worked in a meaningful manner across the last three premium brands I purchased. Yes it dims, often to the point of cataract inducing pointlessness. I discovered a trick after letting the appliance break-in for a week, setting it to standard picture mode, then optionally set to game mode, touching nothing else. I can enable Energy Star. I then drill the options below it and bumped one parameter by one point. Magically the picture reveals the glorious cinematic joy I had hoped for and now possess!Low power consumption, extraordinary picture quality, fantastic 60P frame rates for gaming...once you locate game mode. Yes- you will probably want to turn game mode of again for streaming of other entertainment-unless the game console provides the content. Maybe...For the price I am very happy...like really happy...totally happy...ecstatically rapturous.it only took 4 HDTV set replacements from different premium manufactures to finally get one that looks as good or better than my computer screens.

Believe me, I never purchase anything without doing a lot of research, and I did as such. Lot's of research, about 3-4 weeks of it before I decided on this TV. I also looked at TVs at a couple of big box stores, and Samsung TVs looked better than other brands by a long shot.I didnt care about the 3D, this was just a bonus really. I didn't need any fancy bells & whistles, just a TV.I had it narrowed down to this model or the Samsung UN46EH5000. We went with this model for the higher refresh rate for just a little bit more money. Now there are some reviewers on here giving bad reviews for picture quality, saying the TV looks terrible. I am convinced these people just don't know how to set it up, or are not hooking the right cables into it. Yes, this TV needs to be calibrated when you set it up, the factory settings are not that good. It's not that hard to do, a little research, a little time & \"wah la\" this TV looks friggin\" amazing. I love the fact this TV has so many different settings, which allows you to really dial it in. There is a great review in these reviews from a very knowledgeable reviewer, that tells you how to dial it in. I didn't go exactly with his settings, but it definatly was a good starting point.All in all, I am very pleased with this TV. The picture clarity is awesome, the colors rich and vivid, the controls allow you to dial in every aspect of the TV, & with the thin bevel design, the TV looks great too. Would recommend to anybody.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV if you can catch it on sale", "Author": "Brad the Tech Wizard", "ReviewID": "R39IS6NOTA41OM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Where to begin? Well, I got this TV during the black Friday sale. Price was $699 and with my Prime Membership, shipping was fast and free. The TV weighs about 25 lbs so shipping, set up and moving have all been easy with this TV. Samsung really did a great job with this one in terms of weight vs picture quality. But let's get down to the good stuff.The picture quality is superb. It's like night and day over my aged LG LCD TV. To clarify, this Samsung is an LED HDTV which helps account for why it's so lightweight but has stunning images. 55 inches is more than enough for the average living room and this sits wonderfully in mine. I'm a heavy tech enthusiasts so I did my research before buying so let me tell you why I chose this one.120hz - This TV rocks 120hz which is what everyone should all want (at least 120hz) but don't automatically assume that means you are forced into the \"soap opera\" effect. That effect is handled by a different setting, in fact 2, called Judder Reduction and Blur Reduction/Removal. Both have custom sliders for you to set the effects to however strong or light you want which is a great design choice.  Personally, I like the \"soap opera\" effect because, to me, it makes the picture more life-like. And honestly, isn't that what everyone is going for in a TV? How beautiful and life like the images are? Well then crank Judder Reduction and Blur Removal up to 5 and try it out. It's a nice middle ground.Stunning display - This TV is beautiful to look at. Pacfic Rim, The Hobbit, Star Wars, How to Train Your Dragon, all looked dazzling on this TV. You will find tweaking the settings makes things look better, but I found that, right out of the box, this TV delivered... even though, yes, I eventually tweaked everything.3D - This TV is great for 3D. Prometheus, The Hobbit, Avatar, and even The Little Mermaid all look great. However, be careful, as many factors attribute to the quality of the 3D you're viewing. The player, the TV, the movie and your cables. Remember, to view in 3D with this TV, you will need: ACTIVE 3D Glasses (Best Buy, Amazon, etc) a 3D BluRay player, a 3D BluRay movie, and compatible 3D BluRay HDMI cables. They're called High Speed and can be found on Amazon for like 5 bucks. Also, the angle in which your viewing and the lighting conditions have played roles in my 3D viewing experience. Get your living room dark, and sit far enough away from the TV for great 3D viewing pleasure.SPECIAL NOTES: For proper 3D viewing, \"Warming\" up the display is recommended, according to the e-manual built into the TV's software. I've noticed this first hand. What happens is that launching a 3D movie right after intial boot up, the picture can and will likely display ghosting: the effect in 3D pictures where the 2 images are not properly aligned, creating a double image which outlines the primary picture. It's rather annoying and happens a lot on this TV. Unless, of course, you let the display warm up. What's a warm up? Just watch something. Anything. For about 5 minutes and everything should be fine.But what sucks about this TV?  Right, because lets face it, nothing is perfect.Sound - With low weight comes crap speakers in the TV world and this thing is terrible with sound. It has enough audio to get you going until you buy a sound-bar or a 5.1/7.1 system but overall the speakers are crap. But it's a con that is acceptable as I was also purchasing a sound-bar.Judder Reduction:  For some reason, on this set, high amounts of judder reduction (setting the slider to 10 instead of say, 4) introduces pixelation around fast moving objects. It's disgusting and terrible to see and once you notice it (because not everyone will) you will never be able to not notice it again. Its unfortunate because for me, it severely dampens one primary feature of this products, thus my 4 star review. Why even have the slider go so far up if it distorts the picture so much? Not good.Audio Sync - While a minor and almost completely eradicated problem, it was a problem none the less. For some unknown reasons, this set has the tenancy to lose sync with the video when outputting the audio. What you get is the actors finishing conversations but the dialogue is still going on. It's a little unnerving but since hooking my sound-bar up to my BluRay player, it's all but gone away. I haven't noticed it in months. When I did notice it, changing the sound settings and rebooting the TV seemed to help.Anyway, that's my 2 cents, as they say. Any questions feel free to ask. This TV is so wonderful that my brother bought the same exact model and he loves his as well. It's a wonderful TV but above $700, I'd say stay away.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "All you need to Know", "Author": "Suhr", "ReviewID": "RD9M01PKVYY7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I give this TV 5 stars due to Lack of Features.The \"smart tv\" requires that a multi core computer be integrated into the tv thus ramping up not only power consumed, but also creates excessive heat that shortens the lifespan of all semiconductors within the tv.This is not a smart TV.The picture and performance of this TV IS entertaining and a good purchase value.All you need are a few adjustments. (SEE ADJUSTMENTS BELOW.... copy and paste these adjustments to a text file and use them to help \"dial in\" your preferences, they are a good starting point and you can always reset the TV to Default with one click and begin again, record your adjustments and print them out for handy reference)Be absolutely certain to provide this or any other Samsung TV with excellent cooling space or a law of physics named negative temperature coefficient will cause instability problems.Off axis performance of this model is average at best with some clouding observable but not enough to truly complain.Picture and 3D imaging is very good and quite entertaining.On screen menu and remote control layout is excellent and easily understood.Overall.... an excellent choice for those who wish a large screen and 3D and is an excellent purchase value.My only technical complaint is that the WiFi transceivers cannot be powered off and pretty much every built in picture option (default) is Extremely Bright, bright enough to causes momentary eye pain. (easily adjusted)By the way.... I have never used the built in speakers of any modern TV. (purchase yourself an 1/8\" mini stereo jack to RCA adapter cable (also called 3.5mm) for connection to a home stereo systems that do not use digital connection, this cable is Not Supplied)The picture on this TV is very sensitive to pink, magenta, and red, you will need to make some adjustments. (the natural light color of an LED is red so this is no surprise)The screen is a gloss finish and will require some room light placement that minimizes reflections. (not a matte finish)Last complaint is the lack of a built in strain relief for attached cables. A cable strain relief is supplied in the form of a stick-on gadget, but it is virtually useless and waiting to fail. (I designed my own strain relief)Here are some settings for a PROPERLY LIT VIEWING ROOM.A properly lit viewing room is basically identical to a movie theater, or in simple words, no lights.Since few follow this common sense practice.... these settings apply to a Dimly Lit room.Your television provider DOES alter the \"actual\" picture as an effort to minimize bandwidth requirements. (typically results in a much brighter picture) Don't make adjustments based upon broadcast signals, use a DVD or Blu Ray player.Once properly adjusted, you WILL notice substantial differences in the video picture between broadcast channels and programs including dramatic differences between TV commercials.That is Normal and indication of proper adjustments.Default adjustments supplied with the TV make virtually all video pictures identical.(over contrasted, over saturated, intense brights, intense darks)These adjustments produce a very neutral and realistic picture with high dynamic range.BEFORE YOU BEGIN!Welcome to the modern TV world.You MUST attach your new TV to the Internet and install the latest updates. (don't have internet?.... then you are \"almost\" out of luck)You \"can\" download the latest firmware update to a thumbdrive at Samsung.com. (best do this before the programmed obsolescence used by tech companies causes the updates to vanish)Either way.... an internet connection is required..... what is wrong with this picture?First things first. (Very Important) Can cause several odd picture behaviors.Under System....Energy Saver OffEco Sensor OffPICTURE----Picture Mode Standard**Backlight 0 (value varies from 0-4 depending on how bright the room is)Contrast 100Brightness 40Sharpness 50Color 49Tint G53/R47 (can vary slightly from TV to TV, look for too much pink in flesh tones)Advanced----Dynamic Contrast OffBlack Tone OffFlesh Tone 0RGB Only Mode OffColor Space NativeWhite BalanceR Offset 24G Offset 25B Offset 25R Gain 25G Gain 25B Gain 25Gamma 0Motion Lighting OffPicture Options----Color Tone StandardDigital Noise Filter AutoMPEG Noise Filter AutoHDMI Black Level NormalFilm Mode Auto2LED Motion Plus Off**Notes about Backlight.The Backlight adjustment produces a brighter picture overall and makes ALL things brighter. Watch the blacks while making this adjustment to see how it produces a clouding, or smokey effect that greatly reduces dynamic range between white and black.Backlight should only be used in very bright rooms and very sparingly.IF YOU PREFER MORE CONTRAST after making these adjustments, (less detail in blacks and whites) that produces a more dramatic picture.... then set HDMI Black Level to Low. (useful for broadcast programs, typically not needed for DVD / Blu Ray)ENJOY!POSTSCRIPT (details discovered over time)Know that there are two HDMI inputs to this TV.Each input has its own picture adjustment settings that are separate.I also discovered something somewhat odd....When playing a 3D movie, a separate picture setting also exists that affects the 3D picture only. So, in actuality there are three HDMI picture settings.The 3D settings are LIMITED and many adjustments are not available.Be prepared to make separate adjustments for 3D movie viewing. (the default 3D settings are very bright but do perform quite well due to the darkening effect created by the 3D glasses, I adjusted Backlight only, 2-4)IMPORTANT.... this is a Direct Quote from the Original Owners manual, the original owners manual has been replaced by a generic manual. (the generic manual also states this in fewer words)********************************************************************************************************************************************\"Wide screen format LED Displays (16:9, the aspect ratio of the screen width to height) are primarily designed to view wide screen format full-motion video.The images displayed on them should primarily be in the wide screen 16:9 ratio format, or expanded to fill the screen if your model offers this feature and the images are constantly moving.Displaying stationary graphics and images on screen, such as the dark sidebars on non- expanded standard format television video and programming, should be limited to no more than 5% of the total television viewing per week.Additionally, viewing other stationary images and text such as stock market reports, video game displays, station logos, web sites or computer graphics and patterns, should be limited as described above for all televisions. Displaying stationary images that exceed the above guidelines can cause uneven aging of LED Displays that leave subtle, but permanent burned-in ghost images in the LED picture. To avoid this, vary the programming and images, and primarily display full screen moving images, not stationary patterns or dark bars. On LED models that offer picture sizing features, use these controls to view different formats as a full screen picture. Be careful in the selection and duration of television formats you use for viewing. Uneven LED aging as a result of format selection and use, as well as burned-in images, are not covered by your Samsung limited warranty.\"********************************************************************************************************************************************Do the math.... for an average viewing time of 42 hours per week you can watch one 2 hour movie with an aspect ratio of 2:35 or 2:40 or 4:3 per week.Or in simplistic terms, a full screen (4:3) OR letterboxed movie that has black bars.Full screen or 4:3 movie can be made to consume the entire screen at loss of clarity by using the Wide Fit option under Screen Adjustment.2:35 aspect ratio movie cannot be viewed without letterboxing unless your DVD / Blu Ray Player has a Zoom function and this will reduce clarity and cause some pixelation.Best bet is to purchase movies that are 1:85 aspect ratio.This causes a problem since so many modern movies are 2:35 aspect ratio.(the studio refuses to crop 2:35 aspect ratio movies to 1:85 because the studio regards HD TV engineering design and specification requirements as Not Important even though.... EVERY MOVIE is cropped from its original source form. For DECADES, the top, bottom, and sides of all movies have been cropped. How do you suppose they get rid of shotgun mikes on booms? (explains why so many shots clip off the tops of heads) This cropping process remains utilized today on all widescreen format movies.... you Never see the \"entire\" picture. Widescreen formats are based upon the geometry of theaters.... theaters that ALSO crop the image to prevent displaying the projected image on the walls, floor, and ceiling.... shutters)So, Owner Beware!.... improper aspect movies can harm your new TV and is not covered under warranty.Here is a hands on explanation regarding aspect ratios and with regard to efforts you should consider to prevent \"Burn In\" not covered under warranty.If you are viewing a 2:35 aspect ratio that is a broadcast program you have the options of Zoom 1 and Zoom 2 in most cases.Zoom 1 will fill the screen with a 2:35 aspect ratio broadcast. (Zoom 2 is simply a zoomed version of Zoom 1 and useful for old CinemaScope or PanaVision movies and will stretch the image, makes all look taller and skinnier)The reason you can do this to a broadcast show is because it is not truly HD content despite that it is advertised AS.... HD. (some exceptions will apply)If you are on the HDMI 2 (HDMI/DVI) input attached to a DVD or Blu Ray player, the Zoom 1 and Zoom 2 options are not available if you are viewing a 2:4 (or 2:35) aspect ratio that is from a Blu ray disc.For a hands on experiment you will need a 2:4 aspect ratio movie that contains a DVD and Blu Ray version of the movie.What you will witness (with this TV and \"most\" blu ray players) is that you cannot make the movie consume the entire screen while playing the blu ray version.That is because of the pixel density causing a data stream that cannot be altered due to data rate.Play the DVD version of the exact same movie and you will be able to cause the movie to consume the entire screen. (it WILL be cropped)Are you \"missing\" part of the movie if it consumes the entire screen?.... Yes.Now ask yourself.... why did you buy a 55 inch HD TV?Was it to display one third of the screen in ultra high clarity and high definition black bars?Now ask the core question.Why are movie makers doing this?\"They\" KNOW that you have a 16:9 TV and did not buy a widescreen HD TV to watch high definition black bars. \"They\" KNOW that your aspect ratio is 1:77 or 1:85.WHY????The answer is.... someday.... the next \"new\" HD TV will be produced in a 2:4  or 2:35 aspect ratio as well as \"new\" blu ray players.This will entice, promote, elicit, and solicit YOU to replace your perfectly functioning 16:9 TV and possibly replace your blu ray player with the latest and greatest model.It's called Capitalism. (how else can you be convinced to buy something new?.... perhaps????.... it's because your 16:9 TV has \"Burn In\" from watching incorrect aspect ratio movies in a letterbox?)In the meantime.... is it wise to create \"Burn In\" on your new TV?What matters most?HUMOR: I must admit, the BLACK BARS on these wacko ratio letterboxed blu ray movies ARE extremely high definition..... just as high definition as the rest of the movie.Getting rid of my old 4:3 TV was supposed to solve the problems of watching widescreen movies in a letterbox.... Oh Well.Here is how the Zoom and Wide Fit will function.If you choose either Zoom or Wide Fit, this TV will apply those settings to any broadcast channel that is not 1920x1080 and will Not apply those settings to a true HD picture Automatically.For example, say you have an old 4:3 movie (Full Frame) and you select Wide Fit to prevent burn in.This setting will apply to any movie you watch that is not 1920x1080 and this setting will not go away unless you manually change it. (it is Semi Automatic and is a setting unique and separate to each HDMI input)If you choose Zoom, this setting will apply to all movies and channels EXCEPT true HD content regardless of aspect ratio.You cannot Zoom a 2:35 or 2:4 Blu Ray movie or true HD content on this TV.In the case of broadcast programming.... the durn commercials are virtually all a 1:85 ratio and this annoying alteration helps prevent burn in if watching a letterboxed broadcast program. (no need to worry about burn in)Obviously this is not true for premium broadcast movie channels.Well boys and girls, it is time to observe REALITY.At least the aspect ratio portion of this review sounds like an opinion.How does a person make a statement that is not an opinion?The answer is, share a repeatable experiment.THE ASPECT RATIO ISSUE:The arguments I have received regarding movies that are letterboxed or incorrect aspect ratio IS....If the movie fills the entire screen, you are missing part of the movie. (it is cropped)No matter what I have stated, this is ALWAYS the argument for having one third of your big widescreen HD TV show nothing but black.EVIDENTLY these persons failed to realize that I was specifically referencing NEW MOVIES.Here is the experiment and conditions.The vast and overwhelming number (if not ALL) HD Widescreen TV's that exist today on planet earth are 16:9 aspect ratio or 1.77 or 1.85.Buy the blu ray movie \"Epic\" and watch it on your magnificent 16:9 HD TV and what do you see?You will see a letterboxed movie and one third of your TV screen is nothing but black bars.Here comes that argument.... \"if it wasn't letterboxed, you would be missing part of the movie\".Really????The movie \"Epic\" 3D is Entirely Computer Generated. Did that fly by too fast?\"Epic\" 3D was not \"shot, or \"filmed\" in an oddball or incorrect aspect ratio.The entire movie could have been produced in the proper 16:9 aspect ratio At The Drawing Board and not one single scene or part of a scene would be missing in any way whatsoever!If that were not insult enough to intelligence.... the movie Menu is in 3D and IS the proper aspect ratio, (1:85), until you hit Play.WHY???? is that!Who? wants to watch a movie that only uses 2/3 of your HD TV screen?.... \"who\" is... everyone who says they are missing part of the movie if it is not letterboxed.That IS an OPINION that does not validate itself because any and all new movies should and can be produced to Fit your entire 16:9 TV screen without any portion of the movie missing and without any technical restrictions.I did not share an opinion.There MUST be a reason that new movies do not fit your new TV's screen.I can derive only one answer.1. You need to buy a new 2.4:1 TV in the future, (a TV that is 2.4 times wider than it is tall), because your expensive brand new 16:9 HD TV was obsolete junk the instant you bought it.(spare yourself the time and effort, there is no rational or technical excuse for oddball aspect ratios on new movies, especially CG movies)After using this TV for some time, I experienced a problem that seems to be fairly common.The sound becomes out of sync, or delayed, or not aligned.This has been reported on several models, not just this model.As a technical professional I sought an explanation because the problem is intermittent, the worst kind of problem because it is not actually broken.Here is what I discovered.I had a friend who uses a completely different brand and type of TV (plasma) and reported that this happened to him as well, intermittently of course.The source of the problem is not the TV, it is the broadcast. My friend and I share the same broadcast service provider.Not all broadcast clients have this problem, why????The reason is the Modem. The modem is your cable box or similar. Not all Modems provided by the broadcast service are the same model and can have intermittent problems.(also.... interference levels vary from house to house)So, before you return your TV as broken, check to see if the problem persists for more than a week.... AND.... change the On/Off sequence.Try turning the cable box on Before the TV is turned on.(verify intermittent audio delay condition by playing a DVD or Blu Ray disc)You see.... HDMI is Not a video or audio signal.... it is 1's and 0's ONLY and a hand shake synchronization must be established in proper order.It only takes a couple of missing bits to create an out of sync condition between audio and video bitstreams.All it takes to miss a few bits is a source of electromagnetic interference, including, ham radios, radars, solar activity and even.... WiFi transceivers.The intermittent problem can be reduced by using a quality HDMI cable but cannot be eliminated if the source is a broadcast service provider problem.In RARE cases this problem will persist.Contact your broadcast service provider and request a new Modem.Bottom line, if this audio out of sync problem does not occur with a directly connected DVD or Blu Ray player then it is a broadcast signal problem.My recurring audio-out-of-sync events occurred when my cable company was updating and remapping broadcast channels and has stopped since.(CAN be a flaky HDMI cable or dirty jack connection that persists regardless if the cable is replaced... make certain all cables and jacks are squeaky clean)I refuse to elucidate on any further possible conditions because this review would become a book.Besides.... most everything else you \"need to know\" is in your owner's manual.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Cerveau", "ReviewID": "R2VOFY352KLKKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a 42\" LCD Vizio and my room mate has a 50\" Plasma.

This included the delivery company (CEVA) scheduling an appointment with a flexible timeframe, carrying the TV into any room in the house, unboxing it, installing the TV Stand/Base for me, plugging it in, and testing the TV through any desired input (HDMI, Cable TV, whatever you wanted) to ensure no physical or quality defects before leaving it in my hands.  MOST IMPORTANT thing to do when first setting up this particular model, go through the one-time setup, and immediately go into the Menu --> Picture & System Settings --> Advanced Settings, and do the following:**Eco Sensor: OFF (automatic brightness based on room lighting through a sensor on the TV)**Auto Motion Plus: OFF**Then choose a basic picture quality (Standard, Natural, Dynamic, etc based on your liking).  I'm not an advanced video-fanatic but I wanted the TV and colors to \"pop\" and look similar to how the floor-models are setup without being over-the-top and too unnatural looking (mix between 75% Vibrant, 25% Natural so-to-speak); so I went with Dynamic and THEN (important):**Turn the Brightness and Backlight DOWN to a more suitable level. By default, the Brightness is so high that it washes out almost every color; leaving you with a disappointing picture that will make you want to return it at first (but don't, it looks GREAT after it's adjusted).  Finally, if you did not have a 1080p TV before this one, go into your individual devices (such as a Playstation 3) and re-setup your Video/Output settings to go up to 1080p.

It, hands down, has the best HD picture I've ever seen! It's like looking out of a window.  There is a small amount of motion blur on high action scenes due to the size, but once you tweak the settings a bit, it's very easy to reduce it to almost none.  Samsung has made it so easy to literally adjust everything on this TV to your specific liking. You can even change the depth of your 3D if you like it more or less 3 dimensional... and even switch the 3D settings to your specific dominate eye if you have poor vision in one eye! You can pretty much customize every part of this TV. I really cant say enough about it! Having the 3D instead of the Smart TV was a no brainer for us. We have a 3D Smart Sony Vizio TV and we almost never use the smart features.  Anytime I need to get online and want to view it through my TV (movies and such), I just plug my pc up to TV via HDMI and viola, the \"smartest\" smart TV you ask for! Not to mention that my blue ray player has all the apps built-in to it that I want anyway. The only issue I've ever had with 3D is the lack of 3D content offered by most cable providers, but now Samsung has resolved that issue as well with this specific set. Having the 2D to 3D conversion makes it almost too easy to enjoy anything in 3D ;-)... if I'm in a 3D kinda mood, I can transform anything on my TV directly into an awesome 3D experience with just the touch of a button! I highly recommend this TV to anyone who enjoys watching 3D! But remember, this set does not include the 3D glasses, and you can't substitute any other type of glasses..it has to be Samsung Active glasses.

I did a Google search to see what settings other people were using and there was a lot of helpful information out there to get the picture just right. As far as the sound quality goes, it leaves something to be desired, but then again, most TV speakers I've come across just aren't that great. My absolute favorite feature of this TV (and something almost everybody out there seems to overlook) is the ability to up-convert 2D content to 3D. This display doesn't come with 3D glasses (which cuts down on the cost of the unit) but I found great pair for less than $20 each on Amazon. The 3D quality is far better than I would have expected. For the price I paid, I'm extremely happy with what I got. The only downside to this display I've found so far is that you have to buy a separate component to use WiFi, otherwise you need to use an Ethernet cable to connect to the internet.

Required reverse re-thinking + re-viewing after re-reading Cnet's glowing hosannas of all LEDs Vizio for whatever their reasoning's worth anymore. Well, Sony's pretty much out of the mid-range tier of hdtv competition now so that leaves us with the big guns Vizio, Panasonic, LG, Toshiba, Samsung & assorted lesser wannabes like Haier, Coby, etc. Not a lot, especially if there's such a thing as a budget. What can you get for around $4-500 price range in this brave new world of pre-2014? You can settle for a smart Vizio 32-Inch with, yea a \"Razor\" sharp picture splashed all over their boxes, not to mention deep black levels, not bad sound + rugged, stylish stand, but you will also have to swallow the terrible color saturation only barely hinted at by guilty culprits such as Cnet and various techno-related reviewers online. You're stuck with an extreme of over-saturated color where everyone looks like they overdosed on Coppertone or you can turn it down to washed out, semi-vampiric levels. Maybe it was just the unlucky lemon I was unfortunately duped into buying, but I suspect the yellowish, jaundiced flesh tones I could not color-correct under any built-in, pre-set combo is symptomatic of something intrinsic to their much-ballyhooed \"M\" series. The tv picture always reminded me of black & white photographs colorized - that bad. So draw your own conclusions on these so-called experts and specialists.The remedy as it turned out dwindled down to what more and more looks like the only game in town for mid-range hdtvs now:Samsung. What my eyes sorely craved was color saturation. Deep, penetrating, robust, healthy, natural-looking, real human beings. Not pasty-toned zombies spilling over from the \"Walking Dead\" infiltrating the rest of my tv shows and movies, not to mention the commercials even. So, lo and behold, I discover what sounds like reasonable deal for this Samsung 40-inch equipped with all my fave specs: 1080p, 120 refresh, good dynamics + 3d-enabled, to boot. Only thing missing is \"smart\" wifi which sure ain't the deal-breaker it was three-score years ago, especially if you already got Apple TV like I do or Roku box, etc. Maybe \"smart\" tv era IS over and done with before we even knew it, bye. Anyway, you get ethernet.To summarize, clocking in at a svelte 25 lbs with direct-LED backlight, this Samsung is a light-weight powerhouse that blows the ever-lovin' wilted petunias off said Vizio. Ok, it is a 40-Inch vs a Vizio 32-Inch, granted, but the picture quality alone will suffice with plenty sharp enough image, thank you. The price differential is not that much for what you get. Color saturation is sublime with generous fine-tuning controls and the built-in frame rate customization is a trip, to say the least. Cnet never stops whining about the \"notorious\" Samsung black levels (or lack thereof) - any model - and honestly, my eyes can't discern any noticeable difference between this and the Vizio. If the blacks are still not deep enough for you, then that's what the black level control is there for. And maybe try activating the color dynamics while you're at it! I won't even go into the common, off-angle viewing complaint which seems to be the nature of the beast for these devices. Live with it. 16:9 setting works best for overall picture size. Only thing really bugged me was the ridiculously tiny, cheesy .25-inch screws & holes for the stand assembly. Samsung, can you give us a break? Luckily I had some tougher, longer screws of my own which fit into the sockets - word to the wise! The only difficult task involved setting up this baby. The rest as they say was gravy.

The auto motion plus is a little tricky i set it to custom blur reduction: 10 Judder reduction: 2-3 or off! lol. Turn off the dynamic contrast as it makes the picture too bright and there are back-light, contrast, brightness and gamma settings already.

Also this tv lets you convert your 3d movies to 2d for casual viewing. This has 2 types of audio out digital op cable or headphone jack which can easily be adapted to 2 rca for older systems. The only real con is that the component(RGB) port is shared with the composite(standard yellow ) jack which sucks if you have some older non HDMI equipment but a good modulator can solve this.

I've yet to connect my surround system to it, cause the sound quality is that good!

The TV can read and play the lesser content HDD but if I tried the other it reads it but  crashes the TV before my video or picture files can be opened, however its a lot of files so I understand. I don't see this being a problem for most people, but just thought I should highlight it)Internet: its an internet TV which is good but it needs an Ethernet cable which for me is bad. (I prefer WiFi. Again for most this isn't an issue)3D: nice to say you have a 3D TV but seeing as I have to buy glasses for it. I'm not too excited about that ( again not a problem for most the feature works fine with 3D related media.)Finally it's a great TV for its price, movies and games look brilliant, its added features actually do work if you require them.

One nice feature with Amazon is that I could schedule the day I wanted the TV delivered since it was being sent to a second home in Florida and I did not want it delivered before I got there.Set up was easy, 3D worked fine without having to make any changes - it just takes the TV a few seconds to sync up correctly for 3D.  I ordered the glasses suggested by other reviewers and they work well - SSG-5100GB, just follow the instructions to get them to pair.  The picture to me is very good - I have an open room with a lot of light and glare, but don't have any issues with this TV.  TV keeps up well with fast action.  Sound for me is fine, but I am not looking for more than basic capability.  The only issue I had is with sound sync.  I found that when I turned the TV on before the DTV receiver, sound was out of sync.  If I turn the receiver on first, then the sound syncs fine.  Another reviewer on Best Buy site said he could not get the sound to stay in sync no matter what he did.  Curious if anyone else has experienced this problem.In summary, I did not want/need a smart TV and was not looking for 3D, but, did want a 55 inch TV for a second home.  To me, for the price, this TV is a real bargain.  I own 3 other Samsung TVs and have never had any problems with any of them - picture and sound on all of them fit my needs very well.**** Updated review.  Well, I encountered a problem that I would never expect, and that is both HDMI ports failed on this TV after about a month of light use.  The TV is in a Florida home and has been used for maybe 3 weeks at the most.  We were watching a show late last week when the TV lost signal and instructed us to check the source.  After turning everything off an on a couple of times, and checked my other TV to see if it was working (it was), I switched HDMI ports and everything was fine, for about 2 days and the second HDMI port failed.  I switched the Directv boxes around to see if it could be a problem with the box, but the other TV worked fine on both boxes, but the Samsung would not work on either box on either HDMI port.  Component works fine, but since I want to use HDMI, I am sending the TV back and will re-evaluate when I am coming back down to Florida.  I'd be curious if anyone else has ever experienced this type of problem.

But this is the only flaw Ive found with the TV. I bought this model because it did not have a smart function like most TV's seem to have, given that I have a p3 and a Sony blurry entertainment center I have little use for another device that provides the same function. Not to mention I find that the more complex a device the more likely it's going to have issues. It took a little tweaking to get the picture where I wanted but after I did I totally noticed a difference between this TV and the Toshiba 40 inch I had before this that was only a 60hz TV.

Truly a beautiful display--- you *must* immediately turn off that pesky Auto Motion Plus setting under Picture Options to get rid of the infamous \"Soap opera effect\"; then it looks fantastic.  Other reviewers have listed additional ways to customize but I found the Auto Motion setting was the most important right out of the box-- everything else is mostly dependent on your preferences and how dark/bright your room is.  I think the \"Amplified\" sound setting sounds best as well.The 3D thing isn't really important to me but it's kinda fun to have I guess.  If I didn't already have a wii/ps3/smart blu-ray player then I'd have opted for the more expensive smart-tv model because netflix is a must, but I can easily use my other devices for that.Overall, I think this is an excellent choice for someone looking for a relatively inexpensive upgrade to their home entertainment center.  I should say that I'm partial to Samsung in regards to tv's because my whole family has had them over the years and they have all held up over the test of time.  Quality is important to me and I've never been disappointed thus far.Additionally, I used the Cheetah flush tilt wall mount (link listed below) and it worked great-- *just* enough room for the hdmi/component cables in the back and looks great, seems sturdy.  Not that I'd encourage it, but I was able to mount the tv by myself even though I'm a paltry 5'1\" but it took all my core body strength and I almost thought I wasn't going to be able to do it, lol.

I won't mention these features, since I haven't used them and am not familiar.

Not a big deal for me.Powered up the TV and went through the setup steps; again very simple.Plugged my brother's PS4 into the TV and started gaming on it. Picture and sound quality was very nice, there were a few problems with the Samsung's auto dimming settings, which made the picture look very dark, but I was able to find the option rather quickly and turned it off.So everything was going fine for about 15-20 minutes and then the picture when completely black... then turned back on... then went black again. Thinking it was maybe a faulty HDMI port I switch ports and switched the source to the second port. No go.Tried switching out the HDMI cable with another one. Again no go. I then figured out (after seeing the Samsung symbol appearing after the blackouts) that this seemed like a power issue.Tried turning the TV off for a bit. This seemed to help for a few minutes after turning the TV back on, but after 5 minutes or so the power started switching on and off again.Turns out this is an issue A LOT of Samsung TVs have and is caused by the types of capacitors Samsung uses.

Setup was easy and fast and accomplished in about 10 minutes once out of the box. The TV is decent looking on the stand with a reasonably thin profile and bezel.  I have it on a stand but again, the relatively thin profile means it would not be an intrusive piece of furniture if one decided to hang it on the wall.  The picture quality is excellent with sharp, clear images that transition smoothly without any blurring or pixelation.  The colors are rich, vibrant and realistic and there are plenty of customizable adjustments to get just the look you want with an intuitive interface.  Even the remote is well laid out with 1-button access to all major functionality people will want like switching from 2D to 3D, changing scene types, etc.My only few gripes are the \"only\" 2 HDMI jacks and that no 3D glasses are included in the box.  Also, the sound adjustments are a bit limited (as opposed to the plethora of picture adjustments) which is disappointing.  The other TV I considered was the similarly priced LG-55LS4600 which has 3 HDMI jacks and 4 pairs of 3D glasses included.  Other similar TVs I considered from \"good\" brands like Panasonic and Sony were more expensive (no, I do not consider Vizio, Sharp, Hi-Sense, Westinghouse, etc, good brands).", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome 46\" LED TV from Amazon", "Author": "PhilUSAFRet \"Jewelry Hobbyist, Italian cooking\"", "ReviewID": "R2A0DD6335K2GJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After extensive research, I chose this model and I chose to purchase this TV from Amazon.

It's a new model and has all the features I will ever need.  Picture, colors, etc. all clear, rich, and easy to adjust to personal tastes.

I was not impressed with Enhanced Delivery of the TV.  One delivery person arrived and the box was too big for him so I had to help lift the box into the house.  Then he was going to leave before the TV was checked to make sure it was OK but I asked him to stay so I could check the TV.  The delivery person did then help me lift the TV out of the box so I could plug it in and make sure  the screen was not broken but I guess I was just expecting more from Enhanced Delivery.  I am not deducting any stars for this as it is not directly related to the product itself.No real complaints with the TV itself.  It has a bright, clear, vibrant picture.  I have not tried 3D so can't comment on that aspect.  Some people have complained that the screen is too glossy or can cause a glare.  The screen on my TV has almost a completely matte finish so there is little to no glare which is important to me as the TV is in a bright room with a large window close to the TV. The sound from the speakers is loud enough but does sound somewhat flat no matter what you set the equalizer to - this is to be expected with the small speakers in flat screen TV's.  I got a soundbar to go along with the TV which makes a big improvement in the sound.I reviewed TV's in several showrooms before deciding on this one.  I prefer the direct lit LED in this model vs the edge lit LED in some of the other models.  In every showroom, at least for my preferences, the Samsung models always had the best picture, usually by quite a bit over the other name brands like Sony, Panasonic, Vizio and LG.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the money.", "Author": "Erik C.", "ReviewID": "R3I0UCKR9EWQTT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is pretty good for the price you're getting it at.

I already have an Xbox so having preinstalled apps on my television would be pointless. Anyways, I'm twenty and still hadn't purchased my first TV. So there was a lot to consider but the size (40\") is perfect. I love the square stand that it rests on and the audio and picture quality are just right (I do use an HDMI cable to connect my Xbox). I didn't have to change any of the settings that most people did to make it work for them. Watching Big Bang Theory or How I Met Your Mother looked fine and the casts didn't look soap opera-like, like some people were complaining about. I only use my Xbox with this, so I have no idea what cable or satellite would look like picture quality-wise. Not only that, this TV is ridiculously light weight. I swear, it only feels like 20 lbs, which is great because it's really easy to move it when me and my friends do LAN parties. Which reminds me, that's the reason why I bought it with 120Hz because I play a lot of video games. Anywho! Pick the TV that works for you! Take your time, I sat on my decision for a solid two weeks before I finally made my choice and it never hurts to look at reviews or look on YouTube/Google for more information on what you're buying. Only downsides might be that I wish now it had more HDMI ports. I think it only has two because I got a Chrome Cast and now all my ports are used up. Still love this TV though regardless. Oh!

My sound prob may be worse than it is for others, cause my tv's almost directly in front of my loud air conditioner. Some buttons on the remote feel awkwardly placed in comparison to others. As for connections, this new tv has a lot less connections than my last Samsung LCD from about 4 years ago. This limits greatly what I can have connected to tv & I'm not an all in one kinda a guy. I like having a roku, & a blu-ray. I do most of my gaming on another set. Despite all this I still feel like this is 4 star tv.

Unfortunately the TV was damaged. The packaging was not damaged so I assume the TV was damaged at the manufacturer as the screen looked like someone had kicked it on the edge as there is a crescent shaped shattered area where the screen meets the top of the frame. These things happen so I am not bothered by it and on Saturday 2/15 I requested a replacement TV which was shipped as 1 day shipping (sweet!). It is now 2/20 and I have yet to receive the new TV. I know there has been some bad weather in some parts of the country so I expected a slight delay of maybe a day or 2 but we are now on 4 days delayed. You would think that since this is a replacement they would be on the ball about getting it to me quickly and you can see that they tried with the one day shipping but failed. It is now in transit to my city so I expect to not receive it for another 2 days. Whether this is an issue with Amazon or UPS I do not know.

In my experience, it has the worst picture quality of any TV I have ever owned.  The white balance is so far off that it is nearly impossible for it to display a realistic skin tone.  I have been battling with this TV for about two weeks now trying every combination of settings imaginable to attain a decent picture, but it does not seem possible without springing for a professional calibration.The set has four color tones available including Cool, Standard, Warm1, and Warm2.  Unfortunately, none of them offer a neutral white balance.  Of the color tones available, Standard should be the closest to neutral, but instead it has a very heavy red saturation.  Consequently, skin tones are way too red, and no matter what I do to reduce or counteract this, the rest of the picture suffers.  Unfortunately, the other color tones are no better.  Cool has a heavy blue saturation, while Warm1 is very yellow, and Warm2 is practically tan.  The menu does include a white balance control, but it is pretty much useless.  Even with the red turned all the way down, the skin tones are still far too red.Aside from the terrible picture quality, I was very disappointed to find out that when using the optical output, Dolby Digital is only available while watching live TV.  The audio for all HDMI sources is output as 2 channel PCM.  That's an unforgivable loss of fidelity.  Fortunately, I was able to work around the problem by routing the audio through an optical switch rather than the TV, but that was a huge pain because my previous TV was able to output Dolby Digital no matter which source I was watching.I mainly purchased the TV for its 3D capabilities, and I have to say that in that respect, it did not disappoint.  Some people have complained that the TV does not come with any 3D glasses, but I look at that as a bonus because I do not like the design of Samsung's 3D glasses, so by not including them, Samsung saved me some money on the cost of the TV, and I was able to purchase some non-Samsung 3D glasses which worked very well for me.The bottom line is that I really wanted to love this TV, but unfortunately, I have come to hate it because of its poor picture quality, so I would not recommend it to anyone under any circumstances.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Recommended by our cable guy", "Author": "MSM", "ReviewID": "R2IZ6FKCGTCAJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came highly recommended - and we couldn't be happier.We just wish we would have upgraded earlier.Clear pic and sound.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "The present TV card failures energy source. and restarts every few minutes.", "Author": "ENDER ALEXANDER LOZANO MILANO", "ReviewID": "R25EV3WFC6WVSV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The present TV card failures energy source. and restarts every few minutes. and do not recommend them. very poor quality.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Average", "Author": "Michele", "ReviewID": "R1M1PXUO2DSY72", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, this television has a nice picture and is adequate for what my family desires.

We were given various times for delivery and on the first attempt, no one showed up to deliver the item and to compound that, no one called.  One wasted day.  Then after complaining about this, we got another window of time that the TV could come.  They gave us a three day window with no time frame and the status said that the issue was on us.  That we needed to contact the shipping company.  We finally got a call the second day into the new 3 day window.  The call was late at night so we had no option of returning the call that evening.  The caller did leave a voice mail telling us that now they need to change from the 3 day window to the following weekend with a time range of 8am-2pm.  This date was more than a week after the guaranteed delivery date.  All in all, we never got the TV delivered as we couldn't wait unit the following week appointment to deliver the TV.  This experience was the worst that I have ever had with Amazon and leaves me wondering if I can ever buy anything from them again.  No one took responsibility for this issue and they both pushed the blame to the other side.  Even though we never got the TV, Amazon wouldn't refund our money until they got the TV back from the shipping company.  You have to wonder about that.  We never had it, yet we have to wait until they get the TV back in another week or so.I would just say to beware if you buy a TV from Amazon as the shipping nightmare wasn't readily available on the reviews, but the shipping company CEVA had horrible reviews everywhere.

We'll be ok with it, but I just wish it were a better picture. The sound is ok, but we got a Samsung soundbar that sounds good, but the remote for the soundbar cannot be made to change the volume with the Comcast Universal remote.

Estimated cost is $1200!!! I called Samsung, explained the situation, and asked their help to mitigate the repair cost. Samsung said \"too bad\". The warranty expired so they won't help. I know the warranty is only 1 year but should I just swallow the fact that the TV I paid a couple of thousand dollars for lasted only 4 years? And repair costs as much as buying a new one? It's ridiculous. As automobile manufactures do for power-train, TV manufacturers should provide longer warranty for the most critical and expensive parts like the LCD panel.
