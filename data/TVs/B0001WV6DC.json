The menu controls are very easy to navigate, the system found all channels and pretty much set it self up with no input from me. I like the letterbox features, the auto clock and the remote is very easy to navigate. The picture quality is good except for motion scenes. I found that LCD's do not match the clarity of motion of a tube tv. ANY motion is just not clear and is quite evident in extreme motion scenes.  If it wasn't for this drawback, I would have rated it a 5.", "Date": "December 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable Picture and Quality", "Author": "Bigrin", "ReviewID": "R21RE5MIPM3MG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best small unit TV ever owned.  Sharp's quality in remarkable.  Has many neat features, too many to list.  Sound is great and the picture is even better.  Auto contrast feature is nice, but the slimness and weight are remarkable.  Compared all LCD Flat panel's, read all the reviews and decided to jump into the Sharp.  Amazon had the best deal going.  Great price and a quality unit.", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "15\" Aquos", "Author": "S.

LCD screens still don't match the quality of a regular CRT television when displaying images of fast moving objects.  This is a small drawback considering all the advantages (and it just looks cooler).  The auto setup worked great, and there are many easy to use options to fine-tune your preferences.  Removeable covers for recessed input jacks are a nice touch to keep all the wires and cable out of sight and neater.", "Date": "February 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Just Great", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R2ECAF5X97V7XS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my camper, not only does it not take up any space, the picture quality is crystal clear and setup is a breeze.", "Date": "September 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "Didn't realize I was buying a used tv.", "Author": "Judith L.
