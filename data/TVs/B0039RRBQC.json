{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Maybe best 2D choice of 2010, but could be better...", "Author": "Jamey", "ReviewID": "RKWL648SPRCNG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I just received my second set from Amazon today.  The first set had an issue on the inside of the GLOSSY glass screen.  I couldn't tell if it was a thread or a small crack in the screen.  It obviously wasn't supposed to be there, and Amazon swapped it out for me.  I'm on my first couple hours on the second set, but I haven't see the same issue with the second set yet.  This does support a couple other reviewers suggesting quality control may be an issue with these sets.  This contradicts the weight of the TV suggesting it should be very well built.The TV is stunningly simple to look at.  There isn't a lot of extra bezel or showy manufacturer's name plates.  I love this, as I'm usually driven nuts at having to look at a constant advertisment of a product I've already purchased.  The \"LG\" that lights up at the bottom when the TV is turned on, can be set to be off when the set is on.  This effectively means in a dark room (as mine is), the ONLY thing you see on this TV is the picture...exactly as it should be.  The only exception is a small set of lights along the bottom that are only powered during power on and off to inform the viewer of this.My general impression on the picture quality is mostly very impressed.  I'm not a display expert so I'll only state what I notice as a slightly more \"techy\" than average viewer.  These sets do seem to have a screen uniformity issue.  Large and bright,  white or very light colored sections of the screen will show light horizontal bands.  These bands are light, but can be distracting depending on the viewer.  It seemed to get better with more hours on the first set, but it could have been the firmware issue.  Either way, know that if you watch a lot of content containing mostly white screens, you may want to look at another TV.  Some people claim to not be able to see this.  Others state they see even more of it during panning scenes.  Perhaps there is some difference from one panel to the next.  Either way, I have seen it on two sets, so anyone looking at purchasing the set should expect it, unless there is an update (software or hardware) to the set at some time.I looked at a backlit/local dimmed set like this for one big reason though...CONTRAST.  Buying this set to watch solid bright screens would seem to be a waste.  Where this particular set really shows it stuff is in the black level it can achieve.  Movies are beautiful.  I thought my old RPTV had a nice picture, but the sharpness and clarity of the 55LE8500 really put my old set to shame.  As mentioned above, when you turn off the LG logo, all you see is the picture.  Even if there is letterboxing, you will only see the picture.  The rest of the screen will be as black as the bezel, and in a dark room, you won't notice it as letterboxing at all.Colors are vivid and natural looking.  The settings from the factory are pretty decent, but count on using the two extra ISF settings that can be customized to your liking.  Having a knowledgable Tech to come over to properly set up the TV would be wise if you can afford it, but it's not neccesary to achieve a nice picture.  There is even a built-in menu system to aid you in doing so.Summing it upPros:Awesome blacklevelSharp pictureGreat colorsNo flashy labels or lights to be bothersomeAutomatic updates if you connect it to the internetTons of access to change viewing settingsdiscrete codes for most anything you might want for a customized remote.Cons:screen has uniformity issuespossible quality control issuesmaybe a bit too heavyscreen is a bit too glossyno 3D supportOverall, this is probably the best 2D TV released in 2010.  If you can control the lighting in your room, and you don't watch lots of source material with large patches of very light scenes, this is the TV for you.  Amazon is a great source for the set, but know the wireless media kit was offered free with the set last week, and the price has been changing dramatically (down and up and back down again).  I gave it 4 stars because it could have been a bit better, and probably should have been.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "First rate television, stunning picture quality", "Author": "Wade Hathaway \"mrwade6\"", "ReviewID": "R2IKX2YKHR1VKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had my 55LE8500 delivered last Wednesday and after spending some time with it I know I made the right choice for a new television.  The picture is really stunning when displaying HD programming.  Bluray titles even more so.  I am also extremely happy with the quality of standard def programming, ie non hd cable channels and avi files.The black level performance is amazing.  This tv has full array LED backlighting with local dimming and does not suffer from clouding or flashlighting problems that are present in other products.The glass front is both an image improver lending a crystal clear look to the picture, but it is also very reflective so you will need to be able to control light sources in your viewing room.  For me this was not difficult, however, if you have a room with many large windows and also lamps it could be a challenge.You may also enjoy the internet features available after connecting the television to your network.  You can update the firmware when available, there are movie choices from Vudu and Netflix and many more options.This product is an expensive item, but the build quality shows and the display technology is among the best out there this year.  My first choice had been a Panasonic 54VT25 plasma; its screen is not so reflective, but I am worried about image retention and burnin so I went with the LCD.If you want one of the best HD displays and can control the light sources in your viewing room, you won't regret owning the LG LE8500.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Top Dollar, Top Quality TV", "Author": "S.

So far I am very happy with the TV. anything HD looks great and blu ray is just amazing. black is black on this tv and colors are quite accurate. as great as this tv is, it does have its cons. analog cable tv does not look very good at all on this set. the screen is a borderless glass screen which can be quite reflective during dark scenes especially if you have a very well lit up room. also you will see some horizontal banding(lines) across the screen on bright blue background scenes at times. some people are going to be annoyed by this, others wont care or even notice it. overall, this tv is supposed to be the 2nd best model of LGs LED tvs and it lives up to it. its not the cheapest of TVs but price compared to equivalent Samsung models, its well worth it as far as build and picture quality go.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Has minor issues", "Author": "Network10", "ReviewID": "R2LEAPTEZ6PQII", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this TV for almost one month now.  Overall, I'm very pleased with it.  There are only three items that I'm less than satisfied with:(1) Banding in the video.  I notice, especially when there is a solid color on the screen, there are what appear to be \"bands\" of lighter and darker areas.  I notice it often now because I look for it even though I try to stop noticing it.  This effect is, apparently, due to the local dimming feature.  LG didn't quite get this set perfect because of this issue.(2) The \"down\" button on the remote control is too close to the \"widgets\" button.  Often my finger slips off the down arrow and onto \"widgets\", and messes up what I was trying to do with the arrows.(3) The \"favorite channels\" button only brings up a menu list of favorite channels, rather than flipping through them.  I wish I could press the \"favorite\" button and have it select the next channel in my favorites lineup for easier surfing.  I end up having to use the channel up/down button and surf through channels I don't want to waste time with.In general, the video on this display is excellent.  Great bright areas and dark areas.  Great contrast.  There are all kinds of video adjustments, which make it possible to change most aspects of the image quality (except the banding issue).", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Couldn't Be More Pleased!", "Author": "Robert Jordan \"History Buff\"", "ReviewID": "R308P05CV3VUOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After an exhaustive search over the internet, through expert reviews and customer reviews (as scant as they were), I narrowed my search down to the Sony KDL-52XBR10, the Samsung UN55B8500 & the LG 55LE8500.  There were some complaints that the media kit wasn't working so well with the Sony XBR10 and the price on it was higher than the Samsung and the LG, so I eliminated it.  I could get the Samsung 8500 and the LG 8500 for exactly the same price.  However, viewing angle is a significant issue in our television room & it's an issue with the Samsung.  Also, the internet features on the Samsung were reported to be very slow.  Finally, the Samsung 8500 was not available for a reasonable price on Amazon.  I read review after review of the Samsung 8500 on Amazon.  The thing that impressed me most, aside from the rave reviews of the Samsung 8500 itself, were the great reviews Amazon got on its delivery of the TVs.  In the final analysis, I chose the LG 55LE8500.  It might come in second in the overall reviews, but viewing angle and safe delivery of the TV to my television room were important factors.I could not be more happy with my choice!  Delivery couldn't have been better.  The TV is absolutely stunning.  The blacks are truly black; the grayscale is excellent; and the colors are great on THX Bright - even though I haven't had the TV calibrated yet.  Blu-ray movies are superb; high definition television is excellent; and standard definition television is good.  I was concerned about standard definition - as I watch quite a bit of it, but, I was pleasantly surprised.  The screen is very reflective, but I can honestly say that it is not an issue in our television room.  However, it is not a bright room.  I can see how it might be an issue for those who have uncovered windows directly across from the television.  Also, one definitely needs a sound system - the built-in sound is mediocre.Perhaps I should have waited awhile longer before writing this review.  I have watched quite a few movies and several blu-ray films.  I have not noticed any issue with horizontal banding or blooming.  There hasn't been anything of concern to me.  The picture quality has been so wonderful that I can quite honestly say that I haven't regretted my decision for a moment.  I don't know how I could have been any happier with the Sony or the Samsung.  The only thing that is of concern to me is how well LG customer service/technical support will be to deal with, should an issue arise.  But then again, I don't know how well Sony or Samsung customer/technical support would be to deal with, either.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best LED HDTV", "Author": "R. Rossi \"bobrkc\"", "ReviewID": "R1E1NQAF8L90V1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did a lot of research (Consumer Reports, Internet reviews, other magazines, etc.) before purchasing this TV.  I was replacing a 50 inch DLP hi-def TV that had to have projection bulbs replaced yearly.  At $200 a pop, that was ticking me off.  Anyway, this TV is awesome.  Picture is the best I have seen.  Viewing AVATAR with a blu-ray player is absolutely stunning - detail, clarity and colors are amazing and will blow you away.  I have the TV connected to the Internet via wi-fi (had to purchase the LG AN-WF100 Wi-Fi USB Adaptor).  My wi-fi and computer setup are Apple based, but I had no problem whatsoever connecting the TV to the internet in order to use Yahoo Wigets, Netflix, U-Tube, etc.  Not surprising, the sound leaves much to be desired, but when you think there are two speakers contained in a cabinet only 1-inch thick, it could be worse.  Most people will connect this set to their hi-fi surround sound system anyway, so this is no big deal.  Only problem I had was connecting the base (I did not wall mount the TV) to the main unit.  The TV weighs about 90 pounds and you have to lay the main unit face down on a soft surface and elevate the bottom (I used big pillows) of the TV about 15 inches in order to screw the base to it.  Once attached, the base is quite sturdy and it swivels, so I have no fear it will topple over easily, but be sure to keep the young kids away.  Yes, like plasma televisions, this LCD/LED TV has a glass front, so in a very bright room, there are reflections, but because the picture can be set to compensate for this, I have not found this to be a drawback.  The led backlighting instead of edge-lighting on other brands makes a real difference on contrast levels.  I recommend this TV.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG Jaw Dropper", "Author": "pickymickey", "ReviewID": "RTTTE3GD0TIG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I finally did it after probably 5 years of humming and hoing ... I went out and got the 55 inch bad boy LCD. I thought I was set on the 55\" LGLH90 (going out of production) - but the spec on the 8500 was so much better and it has full array LED backlighting and also serious wireless and online capabilities - that I had to spend the extra for the newer model. Another bonus is that in my opinion the 8500 is a better looking TV - the flat one piece glass front with only a thin black border is stunning and easy to keep clean as no dust traps. TV was easy enough to assemble to stand but you do need 2 people to handle a 55\" safely. Once assembled and powered up the TV setup was easy and eveything worked perfectly out of the box. I was a bit worried about the reflectivity of the glass front screen as the TV is in my family room which is very bright with 9 windows - but I set the TV high in the room above the fireplace and this really hasn't been a problem day or night. Because of the amazing colors and contrast it is like being AT the ballgame. The black is very deep and the colors vibrant. Our room is 28 ft across so we sit anywhere between 12 and 20 ft from the screen. Sound is pretty good from the built in speakers - I will be processing through audio equipment soon for surround sound. Also did not get / go wireless yet but intend to do this - right now everything is hard wired. The picture is mesmerizing in it's quality - I have fios HD and it really is another world - there could be no going back from here.So far so good then - I am delighted with this TV. True proof of the pudding will be in reliable operation over many years as we keep things a long time. We personally did not care about 3D although we know it's the latest thing. This picture is so real it looks almost 3D much of the time. Watching old movies (HD pay per view) on this TV makes them new like we didn't see them before.

I focused on reviews and recommendations by nonpartisan 3rd parties e.g. CNET because anyone who is writing a review is naturally going to say great things because its new so it should be working great.  With any product, I want to know how its doing in a year or three.  That gives you a real since of how good a product is.I decided on the 55LE8500 because it had 95% of the features I wanted i.e. fully backlit, local dimming etc.I never concerned myself on how slim it was, I look at the front of the TV not the side.Many of the bells and whistles were not overly important, but, that said, you never know down the road how many of them you might wind up using.This is my 1st HDTV.  I bought it at HHGREGG for $2,049 2 weeks ago.  I could not find a better price anywhere.  This was just too good a deal to pass up. It was 3rd on my list behind 2 similar Samsungs, each about $600 - 1,000 more.  Since it is my 1st hdtv I bought the extended service contract/warranty, which I don't usually do but I needed the peace of mind because my confidence in LG products is not that strong.Since this is my 1st hdtv, naturally I am mezmorized by the picture quality.For me the 1 and only drawback is the lack of PIP (picture in picture) which I did use on my old analog TV.Jan 2, 2011 ----  U P D A T EThis TV has been magnificent.

I did quite a lot of research on the 8500 before taking the plunge and wasn't totally confident of my choice, but now that I've spent several days watching it in action, I'm hooked. The picture quality is absolutely stunning with both HD and SD material, with black levels that are insane. Home Theater magazine wrote that the black levels were excellent but not the absolute best - I'm not sure how much better than could be short of a black hole. The reported blooming around stars in Star Trek was also not present - I was looking for it, but maybe they're just nitpicking like madmen over there.If you're in the market for a new HDTV and can afford the price, this LG is definitely worth it (if not, just wait - the price seems to be dropping constantly).

Bouchard \"bouch\"", "ReviewID": "RHAMC9EQXF7I9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had my eye on this TV for months, ever since Cnet pronounced it the local dimming TV to beat last Spring.  I finally purchased it the week of Thanksgiving.  This TV has many fine qualities and I really wanted to like it, but in the end I decided I couldn't live with the picture quality issues.  I returned this LG to Amazon and purchased the Sony XBR-52HX909 and I'm happier with that.The black level, sharpness and color quality and accuracy of this TV are outstanding.  The great blacks come with two significant detriments, though.  The first is banding.  There are horizontal and vertical \"lines\" that are darker than the surrounding areas of the screen.  These darker lines are sometimes visible with still images in areas of solid color, but they are painfully obvious whenever there's any sort of panning movement.  With a solid white background it almost looks as if the surface of the screen is dirty due to the irregularity of the backlighting.  My guess is that the banding is a consequence of the thinness of this set.  Other local dimming sets are a bit thicker, while this set is as thin as an edge lit model.  The local dimming system on the Sony XBR-HX909 doesn't produce banding at allThe second significant picture quality issue is blooming, haloing or spotlighting.  Text on black backgrounds or starfields such as in Star Wars are surrounded by halos of brightness that are lighter the black background.  These halos make some scenes almost comically unwatchable - the opening credits of Superman consists of halos flying by instead of stars flying by.  The fairly large number of LED zones might actually make things worse here.  The zones are small enough that the halos don't blend together between stars.  On the XBR-HX909 the halos are barely noticeable when the set is viewed from straight on.There's one other significant image quality issue that bothered me less.  The motion processing on the LG is not very good.  Turning it on at any level results in a very unnatural looking video effect, and the TV only syncs to 24P correctly if all the motion processing is turned off.  The lack of a usable motion reduction system limits motion resolution of this TV.  This is more noticeable with test patterns than actual content, though.  The Sony XBR HX909 has motion processing modes without the weird video look.On the plus side, the internet widgets include Youtube, Netflix, Vudu and Picasa, and they work well.  The blacks are terrific as long as you're not getting halos, and the color, grayscale and gamma are very good.  The surface of the TV is very reflective, but this didn't bother me as I only used the TV in a darkened basement home theater.  Ultimately whether this TV works for you or not hinges on how much the banding and halo problems bother you.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Glad I Spent a Little Extra", "Author": "Habeas Opus", "ReviewID": "R3PIM3COR63J4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, so there are already lots of glowing reviews of this product, but one more won't hurt.  I was considering this purchase for about 3 months before I finally pulled the string, and WOW is it worth it.

It is by far the best picture that I have ever owned, and in slow to moderate picture action it is on par with the best that I have ever experianced.The Purchase:Amazon Warehouse often has opoened items (used) with some details as to the condition, but in this case they simply said used and Good. I called for further details and was informed that the remote was missing (found for $45 new online) and that it had no damage or scratches on the screen, and that if it arived worse than described then Amazon would pay return shipping. It arrived in original box, tatered and beat so bad that I almost had to refuse it. The cardboard had lost all integrity (limp like cloth), the box bottom split open, the inner styrofoam holders reduced to small pieces scattered at the bottom leaving the screen flopping around inside and resting directly on the bottom of the cardboard alone (cardboard worn thin from the box being slid around without lifting). Bleek as this was, careful inspection showed only the very smallest chip on one corner of the screen, a few minor (almost impossible to see, even with close inspection) scratches on the screen, and one rubber foot torn off the stand and left loose in teh box. Both of the remotes and everything else was still in the box, and the TV works fine. I would grade the packaging effort to be a failure, but all is well that ends well, and I consider the minor defects acceptable for a used item at a used price.Picture:Color and brightness etc. needed adjustment right out of teh box (bought this used so who knows how yours might arrive).

HD images are typically so clear and crisp that you think you could reach right into the screen and pet the animals (or grab the can of beer, or whatever). Picture is typically so amazing that we were in awe for the first several weeks. On the down side, there is sometimes some jutter (ithink this is correct name). This seems to happen (not all the time) when a reasonable mild action or still picture suddenly has lots of motion, and a portion of the picture breaks into squares of of blurr. My ole TV did this commonly watching football, but i have yet to try football with this one.I have not connected to the interned yet, or tried the Online shows/movies.Speaker sound is poor, but I knew this from review before purchase, and we always use our surround sound.There are PLENTY of inputs, of all types.Due to the local dimming LED backlighting, and energy saving (user adjustable) features, this TV uses very little electric, and I cannot feel any heat emerging from it even under constant use.We are Extremely Happy with this TV!", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buy beware", "Author": "Allmytjc", "ReviewID": "R1V8A6ZKYI6W0I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from a local store due to the price being cheaper but wanted to share my experience. When I first got the TV home I LOVED it. The picture was in a word AWSOME and I knew this was the TV for me. After about two weeks I started to notice what appeared to be a Halo-Affect around white images so I decide to go thought he picture setup (which is a great feature of this TV) but to no avail. I called out my cable company thinking it might be a signal issue even though I was not seeing this issue on my Pioneer Elite Plasma I have in my bed room. During the week I was waiting on my cable guy to show up (that is another level of frustration but this is not the place) I started noticing white and grey horizontal lines on the picture. At this point I decided to contact LG. The customer service people were OUTSTANDING and they walked me through a couple adjustments that did not make a difference so they setup a service call, which happened the next day. Once the service guy arrived he entered the service screen and you could see the predominate lines and he immediately said I had a bad screen. He also told me this was starting to become a known issue with this model (only this model 55LE8500). I was within my 30 days so I returned the TV and bought the Sony BRAVIA KDL55NX810 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D-Ready LED HDTV and so far I love it.

I bought it from Amazon on Black Friday 2010 for a steal.  The picture is sharp, and bright, but not as overly bright as some of the Samsungs can be where its unrealistic and people look liek they are glowing.  Its exteremly realistic in color tones and texture and as i said, doesn't look overly bright or fake like other TV's do.Bluray and upconverted DVD look amazing on this TV and now I prefer it to going to a theatre. HD digital cable is good, but varies from channel to channle, but that's because of each channels broadcast signal.I don't have it wall mounted but it is amazingly thin.  I could have done without it being so thin.So the two main negatives are:1.  Banding- Alot of commercials and such have solid white backgrounds and you can clearly see the bars.  Its annoying only because the picture quality is so superb on this tv.  According to the internet forums there is no real fix for this.2.  Shiny surface-  Maybe its because it looks sleeker as one black pane of glass when turned off.  But its ridiculous how reflective it is when there is any sort of light source.  Windows, wall fixture lights, etc.  all create big glaring reflections on this tv.  I feel like LG designed the aesthetics first and then neglected to adjust it after they tested it.  Unless you only watch this tv in the complete dark, there is always some sort of reflection.Its also extermely heavy and is a two man job to pick up and move.  I think this is also because of the heavy glass panel on front.  Not important to me, but I jsut wnated to point this out.Overall for the price and the picture quality I'm still really happy with this tv.

In short, the TV picture and quality are phenomenal. Before buying anything this expensive it is important you understand exactly what 1080p, 240mhz (true motion) HMDI ports, optical ports, etc really means.  It's really easy to go into a Best Buy and say WOW that TV has the best picture and then realize when you get home it only has 60 mhz.  Anyway onto my simple review...Pros*The picture Quality is the best I've seen in regards to High Definition.  Standard Definition will play just like any other TV.*The Black levels are ridiculous and believe it or not it really ads a new dimension to your movies. I had no idea why people were raving over black levels, but now i get it.*When the TV is on, all you see is the picture.  There is no power indicator light (you can optionally turn it on). This is a great feature!*THX certified picture quality, nuff said on that part.  However, you can choose from many other optional picture modes.  I leave mine on THX bright room and i love it.*Plenty of ports.  4 HDMI, internet hook up (which is limited to only a few sights) optical, blah blah blah, you can look up the hook ups.*Fantastic construction, very well made product as others have stated. Nothing feels cheap about it. Nice job LG.*Others have complained about the remote lay out. It doesn't bother me and i like the fact that it has a quick button for changing picture or sound mode. The remote also lights up.*Internet hook up...Its not like the actual internet.  You can look up netflix, check weather, news.  However I *think* you can hook your computer up to it, I didn't buy the tv to get on the internet though.*Tv is on a swivel that allows you to turn it from side to side, duhhhh.* The TV is great and im picky with stuff like this.*First BLU RAY movie you should buy is PLANET EARTH or a Disney PIXAR movie.  Let the first impression of the TV knock your socks off.Now, on to the CONS...*In all honesty the biggest flaw this tv has is Reflection.  Why LG made it so reflective is odd to me.  However, This is not a major problem for me because i mainly watch TV at night after work, giving the kids baths, brushing teeth, picking up toys, talking to my wife, pulling my hair out.  What can i say Life's Good.* I do want to elaborate a bit on the TV being reflective.  Its pretty bad when the TV is OFF completely (who cares).  I'd be a little concerned if you have a very bright room with lots of windows.  However,  when you have THX bright picture mode on it almost all but eliminated all of the reflection problems in my room.* I have had no issues with Judder, motion flow, as others have stated.* Thats all the negatives i got for yaConclusionI bought mine at VANNS electronics fullfilled by amazon i believe and had a very good experience with them.  This TV is really an amazing piece of technology and i have no regrets in purchasing it. If it's high tech enough for me, its more than likely gonna be high tech enough for you.  This is not a 3D Tv. My TV is hooked up to PS, apple TV, and DISH HD Receiver all using HDMI cable (and not monster either).

The image quality is excellent and is a vast improvement over the 10-year-old rear projection HDTV that it replaced. When I first connected the Infinia to my Blu-ray player and turned it on I was concerned because the Blu-ray player's startup screen appeared different than what I had been used to. The background color gradient covered a wider range from light to dark. It took me a few seconds to realize that I was seeing the colors correctly for the first time! The old set was unable to display the full range of colors that I now see. The detail I'm seeing in HD and Blu-ray material is outstanding.The black levels made possible by the local-dimming LED backlighting technology are superb. The one downside of this technology is that I sometimes see the so-called \"halo\" effect. This refers to a lighter black area that surrounds a light area in the picture. For example, when showing white credits on a black background it's not just the white letters that are bright. A rectangle surrounding the letters appears a bit brighter than the black that fills the rest of the screen. This is a limitation of the local-dimming LED technology. It's more noticeable in some scenarios than others. But, to me, it's worth the overall darker blacks that are achieved.When I first received the set, before I adjusted the colors I sometimes noticed color shifts in the brighter areas of dark scenes. In a few cases, the brighter areas almost appeared to have a fluorescent glow. So, while I was waiting to have the set calibrated by a technician I changed the color settings to match those given in a review of the set by Home Theater mag: [\u2026]Making those settings changes resulted in a big improvement. The color shifts disappeared.I later went ahead with a full calibration by an ISF-certified technician and am quite pleased with the results.

A better explanation of this would be when our Directv screen saver turns on and the logo drifts around the screen, it looks as there is an over-sized rectangle that is a brighter than the logo and that drifts behind it.

So I had to have the best for the money.First, I've been in the market for a top of the line LCD/LED for 2 years now and have witnessed a continuous shuffle in top model picture quality, fit and finish-- in other words, REAL QUALITY.  Second, my exposure to the selection process has also involved selecting 46\" to 55\" LCD/LED TV's for use in retail stores throughout the United States.  These units typically ran company or product commercials, which were action oriented and in need of the highest picture quality.  In those cases, I have almost always approved a Samsung model with confidence.

I can tell you that 3D had less to do with my decision than true/best picture quality for the money.

I also noticed a lot of graininess watching Robin Hood half of the movie was insanely clear while most of the indoor scenes were grainy but since it was only on some scenes in the movie it can't be the tv and the only thing I could think of was they filmed most of the inside shots with crappy cameras.

If I had it to do over again I'd steer clear of this set.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture, sub-par remote", "Author": "Quasimoto", "ReviewID": "R31NI0JWVQSOTC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I can't agree with some of the negative reviews I've seen here regarding picture quality. After a couple weeks with it, I'm still impressed by the overall image quality, particularly when watching BDs. However, while perhaps it's out of vogue these days, I was surprised and disappointed that I couldn't program the remote to control other devices. I've configured my audio system to run several sources through my single Yamaha amp, and it would have been useful if I could control the amp with either of the two supplied LG remotes, but no dice.

I've read this problem occurs elsewhere online so be careful.  I spent over 22 hours switching these units out 4 times because I wanted to be a believer that it was \"just the unit I received,\" but after the 4th one began the same problem I gave up and returned it.
