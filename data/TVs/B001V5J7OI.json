Plus this tv is so easy to calibrate; the 'picture wizard' is extremely helpful.The amount of menu options is jaw-dropping, as is the style of the set. The LH40 model looks neat with the plastic square along the bottom of the panel, but I like the more minimalist look of the LH30, and I do not like the 120hz or the $100 price jump of the LH40.I made a comparison to my sony 32M4000 (which I have now given to my father) and there are some interesting differences (many are polar opposites):-The sound is far superior on the LG.-Black levels are very close, sony's is a bit deeper and maintains black  colors better at angles.-The whiteness of whites is slightly better on the sony, but colors and mid tones definitely have more of a 'punchy' factor on the LG.-Color is amazing; rich and saturated; best ive seen on any LCD, period.-Color does not wash out at all from different angles, only very dark colors and black tend to become discolored (blue or red depending on the angle).-Of course there are far, far fewer picture options on the sony.-My sony has a ghosting problem with dark colors, not so on the LG; motion blur and lag is also reduced too.-OTA HD channels look decent enough, not as sharp as the sony, but the better color makes up for it imo.What was the main factor that made me get this LG?..its S-IPS panel. Samsung is an excellent maker of lcds, but I steered clear of them this time, as buying a tv from them is like playing the lottery. They use 3 different panels with differing levels of color and contrast quality; you are not essentially getting what you pay for: You may get Samsung's own S-PVA panel, the best quality (if you're lucky). An A-MVA panel from Taiwan's AUO (a notch worse than S-PVA). Chinese company Chi Mei's S-MVA panel (worst of the three).Panasonics IPS Alpha panels are decent, but on some panels dark colors appear far too blue from different angles.That narrows it down to LG's S-IPS panel; its color saturation, vividness, and response time are worth the slight sacrifice in contrast and black depth (at least in my opinion).This tv is not perfect, however; I spotted 3 dead pixels right out of the box (2 bright, 1 dark), right around the middle of the screen. They are practically invisible without being a foot from the screen and looking hard for them, however.Viewing angles demonstrate some darkening of the picture, but its not too bothersome (swivel stand helps).No other flaws I can think of at the moment, I recommend this tv!My calibration settings use color adjustments from cnet.com along with some of my own tweaks, try them out!Picture menu:Aspect ratio: Just SizeEnergy Saving: OffPicture Mode: Expert 2Backlight: 60Contrast: 88Brightness: 58H Sharpness: 60V Sharpness: 60Color: 50Tint: 0--Expert control menuDynamic contrast: OffNoise reduction: OffGamma: MediumBlack level: LowReal Cinema: On [grayed out]Color Standard: HD [grayed out]Color Gamut: WideEdge Enhancer: OffxvYCC: Auto [grayed out]OPC: OffExpert Pattern: Off[grayed out]Color Filter: OffWhite balance: MediumMethod: 10 point IREPattern: OuterIRE: [see below]Luminance: 137 (100 Luminance only, 90 through 10 are preset)-- 10 point IRE calibrationIRE: [Red, Green, Blue results, respectively, for each IRE point]100 [-8, 1, -40]90 [-13, -5, -40]80 [-20, -12, -40]70 [-17, -14, -33]60 [-17, -12, -31]50 [-17, -13, -26]40 [-13, -12, -19]30 [-6, -4, -8]20 [-6, -4, -10]10 [2, 3, -1]Color management systemRed color: 2Red tint: 0Green color: -1Green tint: -7Blue color: 2Blue tint: 7Yellow color: 0Yellow tint: 1Cyan color: 0Cyan tint: 0Magenta color: 0Magenta tint: -2", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Okay, but not great", "Author": "T.

We have a two year old 32\" Samsung HD LCD TV that we were moving to another room and the LG TV was purchased to replace to older TV. My wife and I both found the quality of the picture to be inferior to the Samsung.  Moreover, the biggest problem with the LG TV was the deterioration in picture quality with viewing angle.  The LG also seemed to have a slight problem keeping audio and video in sync on a few programs, somthing we had not noted in our other TVs (we have four flat panel TVs in all - only one is HD)  Given the room we planned to place it in required a wide viewing angle, we returned the TV.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Economy HDTV", "Author": "Playingpossum", "ReviewID": "R2OX7B4PBYWZV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG 32LH30 32-Inch 1080p replaced a 720p 32 inch Samsung which I returned because of erratic sound quality.  The LG provides a very clear picture for upscaled DVD movies and over the air digital signals. The speakers provide excellent sound for a small living room although the addition of a home theater system would substantially increase movie enjoyment. Standard definition signals also reproduce a stable clear picture.  Colors are very good and the set provides sufficient tools to tweak the picture for personal preference. I have not used it for bluray as yet but HD from satellite is very good. The features of this unit described on the Amazon specifications list accurately describe its features and can be relied upon. I am not a hard core cinema/video buff but I cannot imagine that this unit will not satisfy most viewers who want a well priced midsized flat screen high definition TV.  My five stars are based upon what I expect in similarly designed and priced units for a smaller room.05/14/2010  I have just connected the LG 32LH30 to a blueray player as well as a WII with Netflex connectivity.  They both work well and the LG's bluray images are as sharp and vivid as those on my 40 inch Sony Bravia.  I continue to be pleased with my purchase although I must also report the failure of the remote control (just out of warranty).

On the other hand, there is a lot of positive things about this TV which I really appreciate.1. The picture quality is just amazing. It really has a enriched color display and your experience with sports will probably be awesome.2. The sound quality is not the best I can get, but it is really close to perfection and I would still rate it 5.3. The body has a rich color and is perfect and is stylish.4. When viewed from various angles, there is very little depreciation of real output and a few faded spots do appear. On a comparison with other models, this is very minimal. Also, you would be viewing from a good distance, which voids the issue. We also use the swivel when you hook it up for games.5. I have it connected with DVD players and it is awesome so far. Very satisfied with picture quality.I kind of wish I have a bigger screen though. I saw this 37\" 1080p [...]which is also glossy black at a local store and is just a [...] extra.It depends on your viewing distance and how far your sofa is from the television.

Simons \"cs\"", "ReviewID": "R1VQ5XFU4OLO5U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Buyer be warned, some of the specifications of this particular TV model have changed in just the last couple of months.Change #1: The panel is no longer an S-IPS panel.  After November 2009, all revisions now have a TFT panel.  The result is that the color depth you will see is 8-bit versus the 10-bit with the S-IPS panel.  LG, and most TV manufacturers, are not required to announce a change in the design or specifications of their models.  To be fair, the picture quality is still very good, in my opinion, and the number of tweaks available to adjust the display settings are similar to those that you would find in a very high-end TV.Change #2: Yes, the audio/video sync issues are in full-effect.  It only occurs over HDMI...but then that's one of the main points of buying a HD-TV, no?  On some HD stations, the sync issue is not that noticeable.  On others, especially movie channels like TNT HD, you will find a 1-2 second audio delay.  I tried to correct this issue via the service menu but did not notice any improvement.Apparently LG has a software fix for this issue; I called and scheduled an appointment to have a technician apply the software fix.  I hope this remedies the audio/video sync problem as otherwise I will have to return this TV.Overall, it's still a good TV, and hopefully LG will release a newer batch VERY SOON with the updated software fix.  Otherwise, it is something that can be remedied, and you might not notice it at all.  Just be aware of what you're getting into.Also note that OneCall says they do not offer returns for TV's over 20 inches...", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Known audio problems...be warned", "Author": "Somewhere in TX", "ReviewID": "R2LCQXU3GOBWFX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this LG tv after reading the amazon reviews.  Once I received it and hooked it up via HDMI cable to my DVR, I noticed a problem immediately.  The audio & video are HORRIFICALLY out of sync.  The audio is delayed by one second or more and makes it impossible to watch.  I thought it might be the cable box so I called Time Warner and they swapped out my cable box for a new one.  It made zero difference.  Finally I called LG tech support and they didnt even ask me that many questions and said it was a known issue.  They took my information and are sending a tech out to fix it.  They claim that they are aware that there is a problem and there is a fix but it requires a tech to physically make a visit.  After the call, I did deeper research and there are tons of internet postings about this same issue with folks all over the place extremely upset.I then waited for 2 weeks and never heard back from LG.  Called again and was told that they are getting swamped with calls on this issue and that they had no idea when I would get service.  They said to call back after a month (!) if I hadnt heard back from them!!  They claim that if you dont use HDMI, the problem goes away.  But thats the reason I bought a 1080i TV....for the HDMI.  Needless to say, please dont purchase from LG and pick another brand, at least for a while.  Also, I purchased from Adorama Camera (via Amazon) and they have a no return policy for TV's which is amazing and quite a shock.

I originally bought it after doing research and discovering that LG used the coveted S-IPS panels in their TV's which offered very wide viewing angles and beautiful 10-bit color. However, after getting my TV home, it seemed a little different, so I did some more research and discovered that LG switched to MVA panels in SEPT '09 without informing it's customers. The MVA panel has a narrower viewing angle than the IPS and it only has 8-bit color. As a plus though, it has MUCH deeper black levels than the IPS and a lower price. Overall, the TV is still great, but I was disappointed because I expected to get an IPS panel. The CNET review no longer applies due to the new panel, so beware and be willing to try it out for yourself.

Best about the LG models is the dizzying array of picture controls, so no matter your particular pleasure, you can be sure you'll find a setting you like, or ones you can modify to suit your tastes.Although I have home theater also installed in the bedroom, I ran the HDMI cable from the cable box direct to the TV and for everyday TV viewing the sound is fine.

She thought the 120 hz ruined the \"movie\" look of films(it looks too real). We went with this LG 32LH30 because it fit within our budget and size restrictions for our living room setup.When we got it home and removed the tv from the box, we noticed cat or dog hair clinging on the unit. We do not have pets-or have ever had an animal in the house. We carefully brushed off what he could.We attached our blu-ray player to HDMI port 3. We turned it on and tried our blu-ray player first. The picture was amazing just using the factory settings right out of the box. We couldn't be happier.We attached our our current cable box (analog until it can get switched to HD) to the AV1 (RCA Yellow video, left,right audio) import. The TV did not recognize the RCA video signal on its AV1 import. I thought maybe it was the cable box or cord, so i tried a video game system with a different cord in the same inputs, but it couldn't recognize that video signal either. I plugged the cable box in again and the screen popped up a message saying that it detected a new signal. The analog cable worked. Yay. We went to dinner.When we came back from dinner, we turned on the tv and the picture (both HDMI and AV1) was noticeably darker. We thought maybe the bulb needed time to warm up, so we gave it 1/2 hour to warm up. The screen was still dark. I adjusted every color setting on the set to as bright as it could go, but the picture stayed dark. Our cable box and blu-ray menu screens were too dark to read. The next morning we turned the tv back on, and the picture was getting even darker. It had been less than 24 hours since we bought the tv.We also noticed that there was a slight, but noticeable image burn on the edges of 4:3 content would be displayed.We returned the tv and swapped it for a new one.

Hands Down", "Author": "Ron Sochacki", "ReviewID": "R15BD5PN1MM1YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BEFORE BUYING THIS TV....I've been doing research on HDTVs for about a year. My new hobby now is high quality entertainment and wanted to get the best TV for quailty picture and price. LG is a great company with beautiful quality that produces very detailed color and picture. I knew this because my girl friend's parents have a 32\" LG 720p in their family room which kind of inspired me to go with LG. Picture is much cleaner and more clear than most TV's I've seen for under $600 at bestbuy.For the most part, I love Baseball and watching the team with the best fans and best city to play in, the Chicago Cubs. I try to watch almost every game along with the Chicago Blackhawks from time to time. PlayStation 3 is another hobby of mine. And have been playing and watching on a Tube my whole life, currently was running off a 23\" Symphonic tube TV. Like I mentioned, I love the PS3 and have been playing since 1998 PSOne and accustomed to the controller. Love the 1080p blu-ray feature and the stunning blu-ray graphics processed by the Cell chip. But I was getting nowhere near the quality and picture I should be getting. I knew i had to upgrade, as time went on the tube tv became more pathetic day by day, \"What am I looking at!?!?!\"The day the HDTV came, 01/21/10, WHAT TO EXPECT....Holy cow!!! This HDTV came fast and a HUGE beautiful box. 32\" was bigger than I expected but really is the best size tv for my small room. Any bigger or smaller would not make me as satisfied as I am already. I went from a 23\" tube Symphonic to 32\" LG 1080p 60Hz with a contrast ratio of 50,000:1 which has amazing black details. Since the TV is running at only 60Hz, the picture tends to almost skip/blur when imagies or the camera are moved across the screen quickly. But overall movements are only noticable if you really pay close attention and look for that sort of thing. On some of the slower shots and still frames, it's like looking through an F'in WINDOW. Blu-ray movies are absolutly mind blowing. Watching the DisneyNature film Earth in Blu-Ray was breath taking. You get a feeling of almost being there. I showed the family and they couldn't believe their eyes because they're still stuck on old, dead technology, and by that I mean Tube Televisions. I can't even look at a tube tv without seeing a bunch of lines going across and static it seems like. I feel bad for you tube tv owners. This HDTV has AMAZING picture/color quality for a great price. This is a $600 TV at bestbuy not including tax so you're looking at at least $650 at BestBuy. Going from a Tube to a HDTV is really a black and white difference. PlayStation 3 looks amazing, it's almost like upgrading my entire PS3, it's completely different and better in every way!

There really is not many televisions that can compare at this price range. The television has 3 hdmi inputs as well as several others for aux and hd 5-6 prong cables.The picture is crisp, it will suffer from the quick action blur during some sporting events (i saw it a little in football) but at this price, its is a minimal issue. Before this tv, i owned a Samsung 1080i HD-tube tv and the difference is clear. If you want to have the crisp darks and grey scale, Samsung might be for you, but this picture performs best with colorful scenes. You can see a clear difference in color quality when watching baseball. Colors are just crisper on this LG. I am an avid gmaer and blu-ray watcher. The only qualm i have is the sound quality isn't anything special. With a blu-ray in the ps3, and using my hdmi cords, i have never had an issue with the sound. It is just watching cable or a regular dvd when i find myself turning the tv up substantially. The sound will be strong enough to give you a jolt during the action scenes tho.

I still cannot believe the performance and look of this TV.LG did something that Sony and Vizio should learn to master.I also believe Samsung and LG are the top TV's no matter what size.I highly recommend this TV to anyone who wants the best for an amazing price.Do yourself a favor and buy an LG, I sure will only buy LG from now on.Thank You LG for making Life Good.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV, surpassed expectations!", "Author": "Michael P.

I'm sure that there are those who want to fine tune it their self but the Picture Wizard was fairly quick and optimized the picture to my liking. The Invisable speakers system actually sounds pretty good as far as TV speakers go. It is made up of things called \"exciters\" that attach to the thin frame around the TV on the inside and, in essense, cause the frame to become the speaker. At least that is what I read online after some pretty detailed searching. It wasn't easy to find out EXACTLY how the speaker system worked.

I was debating between this tv and Samsung LN32B550 to replace a Samsung LN32B540 (720p).  I've had the samsung 720p a few days and picture quality is excellent except it's not 1080p.  The main purpose of this TV will be as a 2nd computer monitor, the other is a 23\" LG W2353V.Went to bestbuy and compared image quality, it seem identical, but TVs were not side by side.Fry's actually has both the Samsung 550 and LG H30 side by side so you can do a nice comparison.  Samsung has deeper blacks.  The LGs seem more on the green/gray side when compared only to the Samsung.I played a bit with the settings but couldnt replicate the blacks produced by Samsung.  However all other colors are almost if not identical to the samsung (GREAT!!!).  At Fry's they were playing iRobot this is where the black levels are noticeable, the TVs were also playing some HD landscape content and here it really becomes a coin toss between Samsung and LG.  Some scenes look better on LG others on Samsung.  I dont think you can go wrong with either set.  However you will pay a little more for the Samsung,  I do have a slight preference to the Samsung bezel though.  I figure since I'm already using another LG screen this will compliment it well.LG is a clear winner on price.  LH30 $450, Samsung 550 is $650However if your looking for a bigger TV run to your local Fry's...LG42LH40 $547 and the 47\" for a few $$ more (website shows higher prices)Too bad 42\" is a little too big as computer screen since I sit about 2 feet away", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "M.

We watch a lot of movies and probably more TV than we should--mostly sitcoms and some sports.  So we were looking for the least expensive 32\", 1080p LCD set from a \"reputable brand\"--e.g. LG, Panasonic, Samsung & Sony.  One month in we are completely satisfied.As for particulars, we have no complaints about the image quality, we run the audio through our receiver, so I can't really attest to the audio, and setting up the TV was quick and easy.  Aesthetically I consider the set to be on the nice looking side of average.  Maybe not as cool as the new Samsung LEDs, but still nice to look at.  My only reservation is that (I think) you need to install a bracket in the wall to mount it.People who are super-serious about home entertainment should probably check out other reviews, but for those of you are just looking for a straightforward flatscreen that covers the basics, I highly recommend this set.p.s.

This TV has tons of features to adjust the picture. The picture wizard didn't do much for me, but the expert menus are great. Each input on the TV has its own picture settings, which is both a blessing and a curse. Blacks could be deeper (especially at angles), but can be enhanced significantly with the proper settings. Despite reviews that I've read, I think blacks are actually superior to most LCD TVs in its class when set correctly. No dead or stuck pixels. My only gripe is that there are some uniformity issues. There are some very faint vertical bars across the LCD where the image is slightly darker. These are only really visible out of the corner of your eye during scenes with moving backgrounds. They're mostly visible with blue hues and when viewing from off-angles.I don't have a Blu-ray player yet, but DVDs look fantastic through HDMI. I appreciated the array of appropriate options for aspect ratio and display. SD TV is rather ugly, but that's to be expected. That said, there is a noise reduction feature which cleans up the SD signals very nicely. Hooked up the Wii through component cables at 480p--looks nice. I also love the fact that I can hook it up to my laptop and make use of every last 1080p pixel. There is an auto-adjustment feature in the picture menu that can align your VGA output to fit the TV if it comes up off-center at first. One gripe here is that the TV doesn't seem to auto-detect my VGA connection like it does with HDMI, component, etc... you have to manually use the directional arrows to select VGA from the input menu. It works, even though it appears to be grayed out.Overall, the menus are very logical and easy to use. I was especially happy (and surprised) by the simplicity of the remote control, and the directional keys have a nice feel to them. Switching between inputs is a breeze, and the ability to add labels to the inputs in the selection menu (appropriate pictorial representations included) is a great feature. I love that it detects which inputs have something plugged in and lists them first. It's so easy the rest of my family can actually use it without having to call me to help ;)Sound seems very good for a flat-panel. It has good clarity and surprisingly deep bass. The bass doesn't cause the set to rattle at all, which is a plus. It's nothing awe-inspiring, but it sounded better than most of the other brands at the store.It's also a beauty, design-wise.

Am quite satisfied.The LG 32LH30 is a solid, no fuss, TV that delivers a good picture with excellent sound clarity for speech.

Was easy to set up and configure. Nicely done stand. One can swivel and tilt the set easily.The one complaint is the inability to size the image as I would like.  The options provide for a smaller image than the screen size - the picture is a smaller rectangle surrounded by a lot of black (like 24 inch inside a 32 inch area), a full screen with `squished' vertical and elongated horizontal, or, using the zoom setting, a full screen that cuts of maybe an inch or two of the picture at the top and bottom - you don't see much of the crawl, if any, at the bottom or the score box shown at the top of a sports program.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice picture, lack of output options, no program description", "Author": "Bought it in MN", "ReviewID": "R39UZBBZNO0JA0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The TV's picture quality is excellent.

I have an older but perfectly adequate Sony stereo receiver with nice speakers and a powered subwoofer.  It'd be really nice to run the audio from this TV into my stereo, but, unbelievably to me, there is only one way to do this: using an optical out cable.  My stereo does not have an optical-in option.  So my 12 year old 19\" TV had more options than this.  I guess I'll never watch a movie again in surround sound with decent bass unless I manage to hook my DVD player up to my stereo directly.

I had been watching the 32\" LCD TV's for specials, they had a similar offer for the Samsung but after reading reviews I was convinced the Samsung shortcomings and it was dropped off the short list. As I own another Samsung and have never had any problems, I was dismayed to read all the bad press. Fortunately I also own another LG LCD TV that I am very happy with, so I was familiar with the general operation. First, the LG was delivered on time and inspection of the box revealed good condition. Installed the stand in minutes and although not needed, was pleased with the swivel operation, additionally the TV is much lighter than the same size Sharp it was replacing, making it a good candidate for ceiling or wall mount. After power up, I inspected and found zero dead pixels. After syncing the LG with the Cable box remote, I began the initial set up, which is an easy process to follow on screen. The LG remote is fairly basic and not as nice as our other LG Remote but really is a moot point since we use the Cable box remote 99% of the time. All the HD chanels colors were crisp, clear and brilliant, non-HD channels were acceptable. Blacks are close to perfect for me and much better than the Sharp. I did not experience the sound syncing problem that other reviewers noted. The level and range of adjustments available is great for those that like to tweak. I tried some adjustments which made the display near perfect even for my old eyes. Sound amplification is far superior to the Sharp and allows for adjustments to match to our room. Since we have seperate surround system the volume limitations some reviewers spoke of, were not as important to us. Response time seems much faster than the Sharp. Since this TV is viewed almost straight on, there is no issue with fading when viewing from a side angle. Personal reasons for this purchase (or justification to satisfy my wife) size 32\" is the largest we can fit in the cabinet, (that is staying); 1080P; multiple adjustment parameters; volume amplification; Price$$ (lowest I found); Free shipping; good looking cabinet; multiple HDMI connections; used Amazon credit card which spreads payments over 6 months. I couldnt ask for much more and would highly recommend this product and Amazon.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "My LG TV is GREAT!!!!!", "Author": "W.

Huey", "ReviewID": "R28HNGSBDQNVTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this monitor over all of the rest of the 32 inch 1080 HDTVs primarily because a few reviewers had actually used it as a computer monitor and had reported no artifacts in the display of text and computer graphics that can happen due to mismatch of the dpi or computer text and HDTV for certain number of columns of text characters. Note that most other purchasers of Sony, Panasonic, Samsung and Toshiba had never used it for computer hookups!!!In general the 32 inch LG comes off just great in the display of my HP laptop that has direct HDMI A/V. But for a complete review let me just state a few facts/notes for anyone contemplating a similar usage  - VGA resolution is limited on most all HDTVs and not useful, something like 1200x800 or so  - On HDMI/HDTV you can \"get\" up to 1980x1080 or so but there is a 3/4 inch blank spot around the screen and it does not appear natural, I operate at a more natural 1600x1200 that makes the windows larger but the entire screen is used and most programs esp browsers let you re-size the resolution to fit any size window if you can still read em  - At this resolution you can easily view/edit 2 docs side by side and not get eye strain, in fact you can usually read the screen from up to 3 feet away or more so no more hunching of the back. You also can place the screen far back on ur desk and actually get more space than trying to use 2 19-21 inch monitors side by side. Also the extra room at the top of the screen can be used to see 1 or 2 partial screens activity that I use for email and stock watch, something that 2 side by sides of smaller monitors cannot do  - Audio on monitor - Audio over HDMI worked perfectly at the start but my Vista laptop got confused as to the default and setups (too many audio control screens)  and accasionally would not turn on audio automatically when I disconnected, so after wrestling with it I make the laptop speaker the default all the time and use powered speakers from the connector, though the units HDMI audio sounds just great to me esp when compared to my external powered system.  - Brightness - Just great, truly impressed by color and contrast also.  - Power Control - HDMI///It does not power on from laptop when its completely in standby like VGA, I have to switch it back on, might be some adjustment I can make on either/both sides. It does respond in partial standby just fine. Reoslution recognition and memory seems just fine and no mixup after many connects/disconnects.  - Power/Heat - Haven't measured its power usage but so far its not generating much heat so cannot complain. The laptop seems to run hotter with the higher resolution though.In general its a great choice and former eye strain and fatigue are gone, back feels better and If I want I can look at stuff from 3-5 feet away and just sit back!!  Next time I might try to stuff a 37 incher on the desk and see if I get more windows in view!Hope this helps anyone out there!", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Well worth the wait", "Author": "Suzanne Rackham", "ReviewID": "R1AZGXEBMMXEKD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Waited 3 years to get a new Tv.

Amazon was completely unresponsive to the concerns I e-mailed.As to the set, this is my first digital set, and I use it beside my 61\" analog set. One big drawback for me is that the set doesn't show closed captioning through the HDMI cable from my new VCR-DVD recorder combo unit, nor does it show the analog display information from that unit. It does display both through composite cables. I called LG with these concerns, but couldn't get past the confused non-technical representative. The owner's manual is on a CD which saves paper but requires me to leave the set to go to my desktop computer in another room.The set has greater complexity than my analog set but is easy to use, and the picture was fine; picture source is analog and digital cable, not HD.

Even when mounted high the sound is great, sometimes too great and I end up tuning the tv down to level 10 or 12. Sharp picture output without HDMI cables being connected. This year I did decide to hook it up to HDMI cables and HD satellite service and I must say I was really cheating myself out of a great experience. Netflix look stunning when its streaming on this set. I am in love with this TV, quality is awesome with AND without the HD hook up. My Hubby loves how easy the setup is. Labeling input is easy, when you plug your cables into the set whichever port you are using lights up on the screen and it helps you label which one you are using so you don't get confused. On my old TV I spend hours guessing.  I also like that there is a main power switch hiding on the right hand side so you are not relying on just your remote to turn it off/on. I really look at it as a mommy feature. When my son started grade school he had a hard time adjusting to the rules of bedtime and even though I set the timer for 30 minutes, he'd turn it back on when he woke in the middle of the night. I ended up having run in and click the switch to prevent him from turning it on again in the event he woke up. That worked like a charm. And the feature that won me over was that it was an energy star product so it didn't send my electric bill through the darn roof. You can set how bright or how dim you want your screen which helped me, even on the 50 inch model I purchased. When my son was younger and I wanted him to know it was time for bed I dimmed the screen to its lowest setting and would turn it back up to medium in the day time (The screen is very bright! You may have to adjust it upon initial setup so it wont irritate your eyes, I am a migraine sufferer so I just want throw that out there just in case someone is sensitive to bright lights like me) In the first week it gave me bad headaches until I got the gist of how to dim the screen. Other than that, there was no real issue that I have with this unit. To this day the TV is working like its brand spanking new.

Fortunately, the LH30 only had a scratch and was functioning completely fine.Needless to say, LG makes fantastic products and I have not been disappointed with my HDTV purchase. At first, I hesitated when Amazon had this unit as a Deal of the Day and missed out. I was so upset at the passed opportunity but then happy again when it re-appeared at the discounted price.It has one of the best and brightest screens for a 60hz unit. The set-up was a little tricky but smooth sailing after a few initial hiccups. I really liked the auto tuner feature of getting the available/free HD stations.

There are a thousands of ways to customize your settings, but the interface is very easy to navigate.I've had the LH30 for almost two years and have not been disappointed with my purchase.

I really enjoy the different AV modes the tv has as well.  While I still kind of wish I would have went with a tv with a bit higher refresh rate because I do use it for gaming as well.  Although I really only get the slightest of motion blur when using it with my Xbox 360, its hardly noticeable unlike some of the other reviews on this say.  Sure if you go from a 240hz or 120hz of course your going to notice a bit of motion blur, its a no brainer.  But people love to complain and their opinions make the world go round...I was most impressed by the sound on this tv as well.  I don't know what LG is doing with their speakers but hopefully they keep it up.  The trim on the tv is pretty nice as well.  Not as nice as Samsung's touch of color panels, but its sweet.Great tv, great as a computer monitor, great for gaming, great for watching hockey...

So easy it amazed me.Like others, I'd researched TVs to death (for the last couple of years) and this was on my \"short list\". I waited for one of my preferred TVs to hit the price point I was willing to pay for it.I'm not a fan of the shiny piano black edges on most HDTVs so, I was a bit put off as I unpacked this one and the edges seemed wider than I expected.  However, once the TV was all set up, I decided that compromising on the edges was a small price to pay for getting everything else I truly needed, plus a few key items I wanted.Primary selling points for me:  the LG reputation; excellent professional and user reviews; technical specs; and especially (1) sound leveling (so the commercials don't blast me out of the room) and (2) a swivel stand, so I can swing it toward guest seating when I have company in the living room (instead of just me in my comfy recliner).Happily, the remote control fits my hand nicely and seems easy to use.  It also had a couple of other features I love and didn't expect: (1) a channel return button (labeled \"flashback\") which takes you back to the previous channel, so you can easily flip between two channels; and (2) a mode button which switches you from one input to another without having to go into the menu (e.g.  from TV to DVR or Game mode).The TV sits in a corner between two floor-to-ceiling windows.  With the blinds open in bright sunshine, the picture was clear and distinct with vibrant colors.Since others have commented extensively on the all the other important details, I'll sum up by saying:If you're looking for an attractive, solid, basic HDTV with a good-excellent picture that's easy to set up and use ... go for it!

On return - you guessed it, system dead and showing exactly the same symptoms as before.  You probably already know - system now out of warranty.  Something very strange with power supply - probably burning out the same module over and over again.No way that I am willing to pay one cent to try to have this beast repaired again.Everyone should also beware of the LG web site.

Another advantage this 1080p TV is very easy to calibrate and the picture wizard is exceptionally accommodating. The menu options are numerous as is the elegance of the LH30. The sound quality on this LG LH30 is in my opinion \"enhanced quality\" compared to other sets costing twice the amount. The paleness of whites is very good, colors don't wash out are very good and the set provides sufficient tools to tweak the picture for personal preference. Mid-tones are remarkably crisp and clear; black levels are deep and vibrant even at different angles, unusual for a LCD screen. Another advantage I noticed; no dead pixels on my LH30 which is remarkable for a TV in this price range. The swivel stand that comes with the TV does more than other sets costing four times the price, another nice feature from LG. I'm not a committed cinema/video enthusiast but I cannot foresee this TV will not fulfill most viewers who want a low priced midsized flat screen 1080p high definition TV. In my opinion this is the best 1080p flat screen TV you could buy for the money, paid $379.00 with free shipping from Amazon.
