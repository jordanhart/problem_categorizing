{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture ... Nice set.", "Author": "JeffM", "ReviewID": "R1U04GQQFYLIUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was first introduced to this 48\" Hitachi LED model when it was on display next to a similar Samsung at a large shopping club.  I was able to compare this TV side by side to a similar Samsung and LG.  (I consider Samsung the best in picture quality across all LEDs).  I was shocked at this LEDs picture quality compared to the Samsung... I could not tell much of a difference at all, the picture quality on this Hitachi was just that good.  I saw all the good reviews, and it almost became a no-brainer as this TV was hundreds less than the Samsung and has more HDMI Connections (and 3D was a plus, but something I didn't really need).I have 2 other 60\" LED Samsung TVs (and another 46\" that only lasted 4 years, which this unit replaced), so I was still a bit leery to switch brands, but I took the chance and am VERY glad I did.  it turned out to be an excellent purchase, I have been very impressed.  Bonus: I believe the sound is even better than my old Samsung LED 46\".", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Beautiful picture!", "Author": "Chris Daugherty", "ReviewID": "R34R6GUB5FHTR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV for customer waiting area.Bright and easy to see in a well lit room; with full rich sound and plenty of volume.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "*** 3D *** SMART *** TV ... Why are they underselling this???!!!!", "Author": "Rubab Khan", "ReviewID": "R1AS9CXGGDDH81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OMG why are they not advertising the fact that this is a super thin 48\" 120Hz 3D Smart LED TV with built in Wi-Fi that comes with two pairs of 3D glasses? Hitachi quality and heritage is as good and as rich as Sony and way above that of Korean Samsung. I will not go into details of the specs, you can find it here -http://www.hitachi-america.us/products/consumer/tv/products/ultrathin_led/details/PS_LE48W806.pdfBut let me say this: it sounds way better than either Sony or Samsung, and the picture is on par with Sony and better than Samsung. Yet, an equivalent Sony or Samsung will cost you at least, seriously, *** at least *** twice as much. Ans at the same price, you only will get a Samsung thick 46\" 60Hz 2D Smart TV.Usually, if something is too good to be true, then it isn't. But in this case, IT IS.==========Conclusion:This is the BEST TV deal out there.

Unfortunately the unit I received would not connect to the internet over wifi, and as it's built-in Netflix functionality was one the main reasons I purchased it, this was disappointing.On the positive side, just a few calls to Hitachi led to a technician coming to my house and replacing a bad circuit board to rectify the situation.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "TV Type: LED\nScreen Size Class: 48\"\nVertical Resolution: 1080p\nMaximum Resolution: 1920 x 1080\nScreen Refresh Rate: 120Hz", "Name": "Hitachi 48\" LED 1080p 120Hz HDTV | LE48W806", "ImgURL": "http://218.201.42.40:8080/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gNMXumVKL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CX2OHY8"}}
