TV was advertised as used but in excellent condition. That was an understatement. It arrived in brand new condition. Was wrapped in protective plastic in original box. Even remote was wrapped in plastic as well as batteries. I was very impressed with performance, especially in high def. Just bought a bluray player from Amazon.
