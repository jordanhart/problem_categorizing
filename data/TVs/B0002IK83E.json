{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Deal for a bedroom tv.", "Author": "D. ROACH", "ReviewID": "RKG4EUI26FNW2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not a time-tested review, but my initial tests proved that this a nice TV for the price. The DVD could read a dirty, scratched disc beyond the menu and minutes into the show. There is a VHS \"Rental\" feature to improve the quality of rented videos. The One-touch VCR recording is only controlled from the TV set itself (not the remote). There is no \"Previous Channel\" button on the remote, but you'll be using your cable/satellite remote anyway. Only 50 lbs., less than similar TVs from Insignia, Sylvania, Panasonic and Toshiba. Right out of the box, the black levels looked like they needed a boost, but overall the picture quality is great.Update 11/29/06:The only annoyance I've encountered is visible color banding during dark scenes or when the screen goes black. Adjusting the black level and contrast does not seem to help much. It's not a deal breaker.", "Date": "June 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good buy", "Author": "L.

He was thrilled with the quality of the picture -extremely clear- and good colors.  The integrated DVD player and Video are a big plus too.  Delivery was extremely fast and the product arrived in good condition.", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Picture and DVD work, VCR failed after 9 months", "Author": "James Olmsted \"Jim O.\"", "ReviewID": "R2BV7GZI7QPOR4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this unit about 10 months ago, and the unit worked superb for the first 9 months.  Then the VCR went bananas and won't allow me to insert a VHS tape cause it ejects it automatically.  The 1 year warranty only includes parts and no labor, so I don't think it is even worth repairing.  I will just use my old VCR that I have had for 11 years and works great.I won't buy Magnavox again.
