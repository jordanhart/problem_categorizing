Like many people who try to make the right decision before purchasing an expensive product I did much research including looking at other products. The biggest issue I had with this tv is the fact that Mitsubishi no longer manufactures tvs and the concern of \"what happens if something happens\". I overcame this issue by purchasing an extended five year warranty for six years of coverage. As far as quality was concerned I really have no concern with Mitsubishi having owned several Diamond Series Model DLPs in the past. After much research of the Best of the Best I chose the Laservue over competitor products and believe that dollar for dollar the Laservue is the best picture HD tv made. Of course there are exceptions, i.e. the new HD 4K but I myself cannot justify spending that kind of money. So until the 4K tvs become more common and pricing drops significantly my personal choice is the Laservue. Advantages I have is that having owned prior Diamond Series DLP'S (which laservue technology consists of) I was already experienced with set up and the \"tweaking\" for the best picture. Like many quality tvs the Laservue has many different settings for personal preferences. Set up was smooth and I found that the non retail commercial factory settings were pretty close right on to my picture preferences. Not much tweaking was needed. Of course the picture mode factory reset feature is a fail safe if one's fine tuning exploration needs to be reset ! Regarding possible negative issues to take into consideration with the Laservue are it's weight @ 154 lbs. and the light reflection off the high resolution picture screen. If these minor (easily overcome) issues are not a concern then you can also enjoy watching superb picture quality entertainment. One last thing to consider in regards to enjoying a completely enjoyable experience (outside of including great food and Co-New England Patriot Fans) is having a quality surround sound system to go with the Laservue.

The picture is absolutely out of this world and better than anything else I've seen.  Before buying I looked at several brands and was actually looking to go bigger than my 73\", but once I saw the laser picture on a A94, it was a no brainer for go with a 75\" Laserview TV.

IS IT WORTH THE RISK OF BUYING THIS SET? --- WISHED I WOULD HAVE TAKEN OTHER OPTIONS SINCE IT HAS BEEN NOTHING MORE THAN A HASSLE WITH LITTLE QUALITY VIEWING TIME. I WOULD NOT SPEND A DIME ON ANY MITS TV'S AT THIS POINT.
