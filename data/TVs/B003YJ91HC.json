Park", "ReviewID": "R25SEF6HUQ3KBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched televisions for like two years before I settled on this LG. I'm glad I did! I love the picture quality. One thing I did not want that I saw on other HD TVs was pixelated images/blurriness in fast moving scenes. Nor did I want pixelated/fuzzy pictures when viewing non-HD content. It's brilliant on both counts! No pixelated images. No blurriness on non-HD content.One thing that I didn't know before I bought it was whether I'd be able to control the brightness. I can, and it's great! One can set it either to adjust automatically to the lighting in the room--an energy saving feature--or set the brightness manually. And bright it is! It's almost blinding if you turn it up all the way. I have a lot of windows in the room and didn't want to have the inconvenience of not being able to see the screen if the sun was shining in.Also, I love free/almost free TV, e.g., broadcast and Netflix. This TV is perfect for that. I can connect it to my laptop with an HDMI cable, and it acts as a second monitor. I can watch whatever I want online right on the big screen. And I didn't have to pay a premium for TV models that are built connect to your wifi on their own and stream only whatever content they are already programmed to stream.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1080p Resolution, LED Backlighting, 4M:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio\nTruMotion 120hz, Smart Energy Saving, Seamless Design", "Name": "LG 42LE7300 42\" Infinia LED LCD TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31xj1Z28GdL.jpg", "ProductID": "B003YJ91HC"}}
