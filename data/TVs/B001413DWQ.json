The first being a Samsung 56\" 5650, it still worked great when upgrading to this model, I just really wanted the new features such as the LED projection and admittedly the extra size (insert joke here).  I did the research into the plasma and LCD units and just couldn't rationalize why I would spend comparable money for a 42\" TV.  Along with this price difference, the plasmas and LCDs, in my opinion, just don't handle the non-HD programming nearly as well as DLP units, too pixilated.  As for the HD picture, it's amazing... I would gladly put it up against a plasma or LCD.If you are thinking that this TV might be too big for your room, it's likely not!  The viewing distance that I typically have on this TV is around 7-8' away and it's perfect.  At this distance it is comparable to the ratio you are experiencing in a good seat at the theater.  You can adjust the display to the brightness level of your preference, but just in general I have found the DLP to be a softer more eye friendly image than the LCD or Plasma and comparable to what you experience in a modern theater.For the gamers, this set is the bomb!  If you have found yourself changing the brightness level just to be able to see the details in darker games like Gears of War and then switching to watching TV to have a whitewash... there is a quick select button on the remote control that goes to `Game' mode that trasitions the picture to a mode that allows you see stuff the way that the games designers intended them to be seen.I will leave you with this thought... You are just sitting down in your favorite chair, the unbelievable smell of the extra buttered popcorn that your friends and family are passing around dominates the air ... then all of a sudden the intro  scene of Star Wars Episode 4 starts rolling across this 67\" badboy while the theme song belts out of a well bassed sound system....... Yeah, it's worth it!Randy", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product, Great Price, Minor Issues", "Author": "Mark A. Adams", "ReviewID": "RT0OWG8VLBYCP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Samsung HL67A750 on sale from a local Fry's. The unit was delivered in 4 days for a small fee that included carrying the unit upstairs.I have owned front projectors for 25+ years (starting with the Kloss Novabeam Model One and continuing to my previous Sony VPL-HS20). The Samsung HL67A750 is easily the best unit I have bought for watching TV (and doing a little big screen gaming) and yet was the least expensive TV/Monitor I have bought since my first projector. The visual quality was excellent out of the box with very little fiddling needed.The negatives I found on this unit were minor, but worth mentioning.The sound is weak at best, but was unimportant as I have a 7.1 external sound system. The only moderately annoying issue I found was that the projector is apparently a significant source of flickering IR. This caused my RX-V3800 to think it is receiving an intermittent mute command from a non-existent remote. While this is annoying, it was reduced considerably by changing the placement of the RX-V3800. While the mute still occurs occasionally (primarily when a person stands in front of the TV and reflects back the IR to the receiver) it is now acceptable.In conclusion: The Samsung HL67A750 is an excellent product with only minor issuesLate Jan 08 Update: I have now owned this product for 6 months and it is a great product. I watch it an average of 1 to 2 hrs a day and have found little or nothing to complain about. As I am notorious for second guessing my purchases, this is nothing short of amazing.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best on the market right now.", "Author": "HCC3", "ReviewID": "R1YJ7B2E732NR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First and foremost, size isn't everything.  But it's certainly nice to have!  When I began researching TVs to replace my 9 year-old Toshiba 36\" CRT, I was only looking in the 46-52\" range.  I'm in the military and move every couple years, so I needed something that I could move safely and that would work in any reasonable environment.  This eliminated plasmas, which reputedly do not perform well at higher altitudes.  Next I looked at LEDs.  The black levels are getting better, although it seems B&W; stores continue to carry models 2-3 generations back for the same price you can order the newest models online.  But then you run in to the dead pixel issue and the insecurity that comes along with an LED, and the hassle if you have a dead pixel out of the box and you purchased online.  Nevertheless, I continued to look at LEDs until going out to a B&M; store to actually look at TVs.  I knew ahead of time that stores don't calibrate TVs on display and you can't judge picture quality based on what you see in the store, but I did want to get a better sense of the layout, saturation, issues with any uneven lighting of the screen, and so forth.  On my way to the back wall with LEDs I walked through an aisle of DLP sets -  a couple Sammies and a Mitsubishi.  They looked nice, and they were larger than life.  Black levels were solid, even when uncalibrated.  So I went home and started researching DLPs to compare to the Sony and Samsung LEDs I had previously narrowed my search to.  Lo and behold, the Samsung 6xA750 TVs were getting the most favorable reviews by videophiles.  They didn't like the sound from the TV's speakers (and for good reason - it sounds like a tin can) but as a monitor everyone seemed to love the LED-based 750 series.  I also read briefly about last year's 650 series, but didn't want to bother with bulb-based technology, so I was left with the 61\" or 67\" version of the A750 series.  It seemed more people had QC issues with the 61\" than the 67\" for some reason, so I decided to bite the bullet and buy the 67\", which is so much larger than I originally contemplated that I can only imagine what my wife is thinking about me right now.  However, the 67A750 is cheaper than any of the newer-model 52\" LED flatscreens I was considering, still weighs less than my old 36\" CRT, and the picture is incredible.  On blu-ray discs the picture is breathtaking.  I haven't seen HD cable or satellite on it (I'm with DirecTV and they provide absolutely NO incentive to upgrade, wanting an arm and a leg to do so) but others with similar observations to mine on other aspects of this TV claim it's the best picture they've ever seen.  Those are certainly my sentiments with blu-ray.  When I set up my 5.1 home theater it felt like I was *in* the movie, not just watching it.  I'm afraid to watch a horror movie on this thing - I might poop myself.  Have I mentioned the picture is incredible?Even on SD sources, the TV looks great.  It upscales to 1080p, and does a better job of it, in fact, than my Denon receiver, through which all sources run.  You will still see some fuzziness around edges if you look closely, for nothing I've found can upscale a SD source perfectly, and you'll see some splotches on a completely black screen, but the picture on this TV even with SD sources is more than acceptable.  Perhaps the fuzziness would be even more difficult to see on a smaller TV of equal capability (the 61A750) but what you gain with the extra size when using HD sources outweighs the advantage the 61\" might have with SD sources by virtue of its size.I did hundreds of hours of homework over 4 months before buying a TV.  I was confident I had made the right choice when I ordered this from Amazon, and am certain of it now that the TV has arrived.One final note, which is about shipping: my experience was as follows.  Ordered TV at 1pm central time friday.  Amazon package tracker originally said TV would not ship until Tuesday.  This is because CEVA tries to get a full truck before pulling out of amazon warehouse.  TV actually shipped same day, and arrived in Kansas City at 9am Sunday morning.  Monday was Columbus Day.  TV was delivered to my house in perfect condition at 9am Tuesday.  Five stars for Amazon and CEVA as well as the TV!Make sure you read the reviews on the optional extended warranty here on amazon before you buy it.Summary: The only drawback of this TV is the quality of the sound it outputs.  The picture is flawless.  Amazon and CEVA did a great job getting the TV to me, which along with outstanding price makes Amazon one of the best sources for this TV.", "Date": "October 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "all you can say is WOW", "Author": "amznhater", "ReviewID": "R319MWWSQQZ72Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is awsome you cant find a better deal for 2k I almost bought a mitsubishi 72inch that would have been a huge mistake this thing has an incredible picture and if you are a gamer you wont believe your eyes If you own a x-box 360 make sure you set it to 1080 an prepare to get blown away.

Delivered in one week by a private carrier, was delivered to my TV stand and they checked to see if it worked.  Very nice delivery and service at no extra charge!  Outstanding picture.  Can't really do a fair comparison with a big screen plasma but at 1/3rd the price this thing is awesome.  1080i Directv signal looks great.  1080p XBox 360 is the best gaming I have experienced.  I have yet to play with picture/color adjustments but right out of box I am happy.  Can't say about sound as I have it hooked to a home theatre system.  Plenty of connectivity.  TV has a nice finish and is aesthetically pleasing. Remote is average but I have a programmable remote so it won't be used.  I would strongly suggest this TV if you are not looking to spend big bucks for a 67\" TV.  I couldn't find the Samsung matched stand so I went to Best Buy and got an Init NT-C1201 stand ($319.99) that actually matches this thing perfectly and has two nice big shelves and raises TV to my perfered viewing height (a little higher than others I looked at).

The key is the variable power LED light source which also offers the best power efficiency. Many plasmas will heat up the room.With no spinning color wheel (which typically wears out), the display should be stable and reliable for many years. The cost of ownership should be zero.My evaluation and recommendations: Use -3 gamma and CNET.com settings. (ok sports -2) . Use little or no A/C power conditioning. Use movie setting for night, standard for evening and dynamic for daytime viewing. Use only the sRGB colorspace setting, otherwise there is too much of an orange cast to skin tones.The DLP chips native contrast could be better. There is bit of a washout in the dark areas in mixed content bright and dark scenes. This is a limitation of the dynamic iris used in projector light engines. The effect is minimized by setting the picture mode to match the rooms ambient light.I've analyzed several of these 61\" and 67\" 750 displays, and all had an increasing amount of red mis-convergence in the top third as you move away from the center of the screen.

Ah, the magic of mirrors.Love the LED technology which means (1) no bulb to blow out and replace, saving money and tech hassle (2) brighter screen.Has the usual caveats you'd notice for any rear-projection model - e.g., if you move your POV off-center from the screen, say, as you walk into the room, the screen appears less bright. But straight on it's good even in a room with unshuttered windows.Does a creditable job upscaling any signal sent to it, with no noticeable digital artifacting.Bought also a Samsung upscaling DVD player; the two speak to each other over Samsung's proprietary AnyNet, so that loading a DVD turns the TV on and sets it to receive signal from the player, and turning the player off turns off the TV.Yankee games in HD over cable also look magnificent - but of course if you're doing HD you have to use a digital input, not 75 ohm. Make sure your cable box has HDMI output.All in all a fantastic buy. Well worth it.

Furr \"Hard to please\"", "ReviewID": "RUVFSL710C6F2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I have been watching the prices on this TV for several months. I was a bit torn between this one and a 50\" 120hz LCD. Obviously, this TV is much larger and is less expensive. I finally caught it on sale & decided to take the plunge. To say that I am satisfied would be an under statement. This TV is fabulous. Do not judge by what you see on the display models in your local store. There is just no way that it will do this unit justice. I always thought that the HL67A750 had a good picture, but I was convinced that the LCD models were slightly more dynamic and crisp based on comparing them in the store. When I got this one home and hooked up (about 15 minutes and it was working with my Dish Network HD receiver) I could not believe the picture. It is at least as good, if not better, than any LCD or plasma picture that I have seen. The menus and settings seem very simple to me and it did not take long before I was comfortable navigating around the various options. If there is a down side, it is that this TV gas so many different picture & sound options that it is hard to decide how you like it set up. I finally settled on one of the built in profiles and kept it there. This TV looks great with the dish HD and also just as great with my local HD programming that I am receiving through my rabbit ears ($2.99 at Big Lots). I use the HDMI interface for the Dish HD receiver and just hook the rabbit ears to the cable coax input. I let it auto program the off air channels which took about 90 seconds. I also have an older DVD/VCR combo hooked up through the RGB component inputs. The DVDs also look very, very good. In fact, it appears to me that the internal algorithms that the Samsung usues to upconvert the input to 1080P are excellent. My current Dish receiver will only output 720p or 1080i signals. The Samsung does a superb job of displaying either of those. One of my local HD stations broadcasts in 720p and the picture is flawless on the Samsung. In fact, any of the digital 480i input looks almost as good as the HD input. This assumes, of course, that the original material is high quality (not replays of ball games from 1986 on ESPN Classic for instance). I would not hesitate to purchase this TV all over again. I am simply in awe of how good the image quality is. As previous reviewers have noted, the sound quality is nothing to rave about, but actually it is not that terrible either. A TV this big & beautiful just begs for a nice surround sound system anyway. Buy & Enjoy!", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Robert W. Horvath \"Robert  W.

Once you get it, make sure you start to adjust it to your liking. Friends cannot believe the picture quality of this set.

The TV is for a home theater style room so I was debating between a front projection set-up and rear projection. Deciding I did not want to mess with the front projector/screen difficulties, I knew i wanted DLP ( plasma & lcd sets didn't even come into the running due to price at this size )It was down to this and the 73\" Mitsubishi. It was really hard to tell the difference in picture between the two at the store. After looking at all the reviews for both sets, and because of the LED light source, I decided to go with the samsung at 6\" smaller, even though I wanted my TV as big as possible.Now for my experience with the set..The picture quality on this thing is nothing short of amazing. The colors and images in HD almost jump off the screen. I have a 32\" 720p Olevia LCD, a 32\" 720p Samsung LCD, and a 50\" 720p Vizio Plasma. With a 1080i or 720p source, even though its hard to compare the different screen sizes, I must say the picture quality surpases both of my LCD sets and rivals the plasma (I always loved the picture quality on plasmas). You will not see its true capabilities until you get it set up in your house! When looking at this set at the retailer, I thought the picture quality was far inferior to the LCD & Plasma sets they had on display which is definitely not the case. The way most of the lighting is set up in the stores, does not due DLP ( or any projection for that matter) justice. This was one of the main reasons I was hesitant on buying the set.The sound is quality is good enough. I only use it for regular TV viewing. Everything else (BluRay/DVDs, Video Games, ect..) I have through my 7.1 Onkyo Surround. (I never could figure out why people negative reviews on tv speakers - expecting the sound coming out of them to be as good as your surround speakers...)Now for the negatives..The PIP set up is awful.. I only looked at it briefly as I don't really have much of a use for it, but It appeared you could only select your cable tuners as a source. I wanted to watch a football game through 1 HDMI slot & play a PS3 game through another HDMI slot, and it wouldn't let me do it. ( someone correct me if I'm wrong on this)The screen is not very secure. I'm not sure this will ever lead to any issues, but thought it should be more secure.Seeing as how this came out in '08, I would have liked to see more HDMI inputs. This is obviously the connection of the present/forseeable future, so why not include a couple more (DVD, PS3, XBOX, Cable Box, PC, ect..)? (I know you can go through a receiver down to 1 HDMI, but I prefer not to).. I also wish there was a connection on the front of the TV for devices I will be connecting/disconnecting regularly like a camera.I also have an issue when changing channels through my time warner cable box (connected via HDMI). Whenever I change channels, it takes 2-3 seconds for the picture to become available again - about the time it would take to switch sources. I have another cable box attached to my vizio plasma where changing channels is instantanious. It is almost like the TV getting a new signal every time I chanage the channel. ( If anyone has any ideas on what this is due to, please comment )Wish it came in a larger size! I know 67\" is pretty big, but I was hoping for 80\"+! (maybe I'm crazy)Overall, I could not be happier with this TV (well maybe if my negatives were covered). The picture on it is phenomenal for its size. It has left me more satisfied than any other electronics item I have ever purchased (and there have been alot)!

I waited from the AM delivery until about 9PM, when I was sure the set was warmed up.  In the meantime, I had hooked up the Blu-Ray player and HDMI receiver to the set, and all was plugged into an AC line cleaner and conditioner. FINALLY: the moment of TRUTH!  The picture was wonderful!  Good on regular DVDs and satellite TV--although the thin LED sets have the 120 refresh rate and 24Hz capabilities that this DLP set lacks.  But on Blu-Ray discs, it is easily the match of my Sony XBR6 in our living room--and that set is only a 32\" (smaller is usually \"cleaner.\")  HOWEVER, I had an apprehension about ordering something BIG like this from Amazon, as there was one review where the buyer's set \"went black\" in ten days, and finally Amazon replaced his set.  (I had told the delivery men to let me keep the packaging, \"just in case.\")  Well, two hours after the set is on, and I am happily engrossed in a Blu-Ray DVD, a message appears on the screen:  \"CHECK FAN No 2\"  I had previously digested the thick manual, and NOTHING in the manual prepared me for this.  While I was pondering where this message was coming from, the set shut off--along with the Blu-Ray.  I didn't know whether the Blu-Ray player, the receiver, or the Samsung set off the warning.  The next AM, same thing happened.  THEN I called Amazon, and they told me to call Samsung, but, if I got no satisfaction, I was to re-call Amazon and they would pick the set up and exchange it or credit it.  So far so good.  When I had registered the set on-line, I immediately got a 3-month EVERYTHING FREE MAINTENANCE certificate.  (The set's warranty is a year)  I called the Samsung number, and eventually was connected to a dealer some 20 miles from my home.  The dealer was none too happy that I had bought this set from a huge mail order company, and got me an appointment about a week later.  When the repairman arrived, he did NOT have anything with him to repair the set--I had told them the problem over the phone--but I guess he needed to see what really was causing the problem.  (By using satellite feed only, it was easy to determine that the problem was a fan in the set.)  Anyhow, at the present, I have had the set in my home since Nov 11th, and it has run for all of about 8 hrs.  The repairman DID determine that \"Fan No 2\" was NOT running, and he would have to order the part directly from Samsung, and not a local wholesaler.  That will, I am told, take a week, and then, he will need to get back to me.  So, today is 21 Nov., and the set is facing the wall in my \"Man Cave\" with the back off and all the parts scattered over my cabinet.  In the end, I DO think all will be fine, and I will be forgetting this \"bad dream\" while watching my first football game!  But, a word to the wise when one purchases something this complex via mail order only!  Luckily, both Amazon and Samsung will stand by it all--and, the price was the main reason I got this set!  Amazon had a 24 months no interest on their Amazon Store Card, and, compared to a Sony XBR6 52\" ($3699) and the BEST set out there, bar none:  55\" Sony XBR8 ($6999) it was a no-brainer to get a 67\" set less than half of the XBR6!!  And, had I gotten the \"6\" and knew that the \"8\" was MUCH BETTER, I'd have hated the \"6.\"  So--get a non-120 refresh rear projector, and get a great deal!  Just so it EVENTUALLY WORKS!!!  Note:  this will probably NOT happen to you, dear reader.  I truly am snakebit, and my problem--along with the other reviewer who had his set go black in ten days--is most likely NOT indicative of service anybody else will receive.  And I state that both Amazon and Samsung are standing behind the set--they truly can do no more, right?  Lastly, this is one BEAUTIFUL LARGE TV!  The front is glossy black, and it sits on my black 82\" console, with my stereo speakers flanking it, and a small black Bose center speaker in front, barely noticed.  Even though it is a rear projector, it is VERY thin--maybe a foot deep in the center back, and one does NOT notice anything but the screen.  (The hookup terminals are on the right rear side, so one does not have to crawl behind the set to hook everything up, and the power cord is detachable.  The TV left and right speakers are floor standing, next to the cabinet, and my Earthquake Sound sub is off behind a sofa, with the surround speakers (5 of them) around my \"Command seat.\"  When this setup is working on a Blu-Ray disc, you will simply not believe it all!!

I found it has the best combination of tech, size and value (plus some great reviews here on Amazon). Now that I have it installed and hooked up, here are my thoughts:Overall, this set is excellent. Viewing HD is really where this unit shines. With beautiful crisp colors and lines, you really can't ask for a better image. All of my friends are blown away and even my wife likes it!I found just a few drawbacks:-Sound is tinny and weak.  Not a big deal since I have it connected to a home theater system but for a review of the TV's merits I'd have to say this is lacking. I would highly recommend using a sound system for audio instead of the internal speakers.-I have also noticed some of the dark color washout as mentioned by other reviewers. I haven't tried to play with the settings yet, but will tonight after work. Again, this is not a huge deal but you will realize that some of the detail is lost. For example, say you have an image of a man in a pinstripe suit. On this unit using the default settings, the pinstripes would fade into the shadows sooner than they would on an LCD. Again, not a huge problem but can be a little annoying if watching a program on, say, outer space.  This may be resolved by playing with the contrast/brightness settings a little.** I do NOT notice the red convergence issue mentioned by others **That's it.. spare for those two minor details this set has a breathtaking picture.

This is my first HD tv and I am replacing a 61\" Philips projection TV that had served me well since 1999 so getting another projection TV was not anything that I was concerned about. You get a lot of screen for less money than plasma or LCD. The difference in picture quality between the two is like night and day.  The new Samsung's hi-def pictures are amazing.  I have standard definition satellite and even that looks better to me than on the older Philips tv.

For $1999.98, free shipping, and no taxes, you just can't beat it.Two months ago I bought a Samsung 40a750 LCD from Amazon and the service was also \"white glove\" service. When Amazon says white glove service, you get \"white glove\" service. I have been to Best Buy and Circuit City to check out this model. The picture quality was great in their stores and Samsung had me sold on this unit. Every time I tried to order this unit from Amazon.com, this model was always sold out.I kept asking myself why this model sold out as fast as they received them. I understand why. The picture quality is there and for a third the price of a plasma model of this size.For those of you who are interested in a HDTV that is over 60\" in size, and want all the features of a LCD, or a plasma, you need to look at this Samsung HL67a750 television. The unit is light in weight, with a shinny black case. The picture quality standing at a distance of 20 feet is OUTSTANDING!!! For being a DLP, there is no bulb to ever change. If this unit keeps it's brightness for the 60,000 hours before it goes to half brightness, then I would have gotton my money's worth. As of now, I'm one happy customer. As for the sound, it sounds great to me. I see no downside to the speaker quality. This HDTV was put together with \"quality.\"It's been three days since I received my HDTV. I went back to the Amazon web site, and found this television had dropped $150.00 in price. So I called their customer service. I told them I made my purchase 10 days ago and I checked their price on my model television and the price dropped. They told me that they have done away with crediting the customer the difference of the price that I paid and the current lower price.

My primary concern about ordering another DLP was the questionable repair history on all models from Consumer Reports (problems averaging about 12% for all brands of DLP).  Since I didn't have any problems with my previous DLP I went and looked at a set at a local store and was less than impressed with its picture quality (it turns out the settings were bad so it looked horrible).  However, I gave it another look after the uniformly stellar reviews on it's picture quality.The ordering and delivery process from Amazon: I am very impressed.  The delivery was set for 9 days from the order date, but I was watching TV on it within a week.  It helps to call the delivery carrier (CEVA in my case) when you see that it's at the local wherehouse instead of waiting for them to contact you (which was in the form of a postcard).  The delivery was free from Amazon and the deliveryman was friendly, brought the tv into the house and helped set it up.  This is well beyond what I expected (of course he earned a nice tip for his efforts).  Between that and no sales tax - I will definitely buy more electronic items from Amazon.TV quality - I am using Comcast HD and the picture quality is outstanding.  The only concern I have is the normal DLP issues and the slight degradation (lowering in brightness, quality) when looking at an angle.  However when sitting in front of this the picture is clear and brings out the HD content.  I watched some football games on the NFL network and it's awesome.The TV sits in a bright room and the screen diffuses light very nicely.  Our old TV (55\" Mitsubishi) had a reflective surface which was annoying -This is one of the best features of DLP's when compared to Plasmas and LCDs and one that is often overlooked.As the kids play videogames I didn't want the problem of burn-in, so that was also a knock against getting a Plasma.  LCD's currently aren't in this size (and the largest size they have is way more expensive).  Three days with the TV and I am impressed - it is easy to set up and use and the picture quality and size have a significant Wow factor.Drawback: the biggest problem I have with the TV is that when using picture-in-picture that you are required to use two TV inputs, i.e., you can't have one input be a TV signal and the other be from another source (like DVD or a video game).  My old TV had this feature and it was nice to be able to sit with the kids while they watch a movie or play a video game on part of the screen while I could watch them but also keep up with a football game on the other part of the screen.Overall a high quality product and a tremendous value at the Amazon price.", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this purchase", "Author": "Jon B.

They brought it in and took out my old one it took me about two hours and it was up and running with the factory settings and looks fabulous. The only problem was I had to go out a buy a TV stand which ran another $300, when I found I could not get the box out of my car called my son and told him my problem, he said OH NO you bought a projection, you should have got a LCD, but he did come over and help his stupid father take the table upstairs and put it together. He then said lets take a look at what you bought, he could not believe his eyes, and he said that is much better than my 50\" Toshiba Plasma set.

I didn't get any white glove service that they talk about. They just dropped it at my front door but that wasn't any big deal.  I have a 42\" plasma in my bedroom and this TV's picture is simply not as sharp.  It may be that I have not set it up right, I'm not sure about that.  Analog channels are a little fuzzy.  HD is pretty good although I get (can't think of the word - why they tell people not to wear stripes on TV) inaccurate images.  By that I mean, for instance the grass seems to get all blurry when the guy is running down the field and the ref's stripes are just a mess - no sharp black and white at all.  If anyone has any specific instructions as to where to fine tune this thing, I would really be appreciative.  My review may sound a little harsh but I am really quite pleased with it just not as \"joyous\" as some of the other reviewers.  It is certainly not as good as my plasma but none the less a very good set for a good price.UPDATE  Ok, I have had the set in the family room now for a few weeks - here are my comments.  It is a great set for the price - superior.  However, if you want the razor sharp HD that you get on your plasma sets, it isn't going to happen.  Sports seem to be the thing I have the most problem with.  NFL games get fuzzy - especially the grass. It flares so badly that it hurts my eyes.  The NFL logo at midfield jumps up and down like it is alive. For some reason, objects in the foreground are find but in the background they are not so fine.  I only have this problem with football for some reason.  I am a big Miami HEAT fan and it is fine for that.  I have used the setup that other folks suggested here. If I had to do it over again, I would still buy this set because of value.

My rating is a 3 because of this, otherwise it would be a 5.Samsung understands electronics, but I don't think they've been in the business of selling high end TVs long enough to understand the needs of their customers. This is a glaring oversight on Samsung's part! They need to come up with some sort of \"add-on\" solution quickly. (I may be returning my set because of this.)", "Date": "August 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "The best bang for your buck HDTV on the market anywhere!", "Author": "Arif Warsi", "ReviewID": "R1L8NXPFDDPMIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply amazing, that's all I have to say about this TV! Samsung has outdone themselves this time, everything about this TV is fantastic with a few minor quarrels here and there! First and foremost let's get all the misconceptions about this TV squashed before I get to the good stuff. First, this TV looks just as good if not better than any 58+ inch plasma or LCD on the market today including the Panasonic Viera TH-58PZ800U 58-Inch which is at the top tier in picture quality respectively but still looses in the size and price category compared to the massive set. Super deep blacks, bright whites, and extremely accurate color that rivals (in my opinion surpasses) that of its plasma and LCD competitors respectively. Second, I had an old Philips 55' projection tv that had a horrible side viewing angle, even slightly. That has always been evident with projection tv's and I was hesitant about buying another projection because of the same reason but when I saw the set at Best Buy I could instantly tell there was no problem with this Samsung. After I got it home and tweaked the picture settings the side viewing from almost 80 degrees is fantastic. I have three couches in a U formation and it doesn't matter where you sit the picture is good from any angle with no degradation wherever you sit. Thirdly, I have only had this set for about a week but I haven't experienced any burn-in what-so-ever watching cable tv with all of the network logos in the corner of the screens, Blu-ray movies, and playing my X-Box 360 (by the way you need to update the firmware to get rid of some annoying problems playing your 360 via component cables with this set) and everything has been copasetic. Honestly I really don't see what people are talking about when they say that they have issues with the picture, I think it has to do with what service provider they have when it comes down to your HD service, i.e. Dish Network, Direct TV, FiOS, or digital cable. I have digital cable via Time Warner and some HD channels look much better than others, but when you are judging a tv on its quality I think you should use a source such as Blu-ray to really see what your television is capable of.Those things aside the picture quality is stunning and I'm just floored every time I turn the set on. The LED light source is obviously the reason why this set looks as good as it does, most people at first didn't know that this was a DLP set and after I showed them were beside themselves. When watching HDTV it was outstanding especially when I watch sports such as NBA basketball or WWE Wresting the picture is just pure pop. You can see the drops of sweat falling off the player's faces as well as being able to read all of the little logos and lettering on their jerseys. I was never really able to do that with my parents 50 inch Panasonic plasma, attention to detail was surely evident with the Samsung and at this size it baffles my mind how the tv does it so well. Speaking of size, this set is a monster and is perfect for anyone who has their sitting area anywhere between 12-15 feet from the tv. My couches are arranged in that formation now and it's just right, like being in a movie theater every time I turn the set on. I would say if you are less than 10 feet from the screen this set might be a bit big for you, maybe go with its 61 inch counterpart.But where this HDTV shines is watching HD-DVD or Blu-ray, the picture is just striking, I mean it's so clear and clean it's funny to see how good a tv can be if you have a quality one such as this. I saw Slumdog Millionaire in the theater back in January so it was pretty fresh in my mind how it looked on the big screen, I just bought the movie the other day on Blu-ray and watched it for a few mins and I have to say that the quality was BETTER than being in the theater. I popped in other titles such as Transformers, Iron Man, Shrek the Third, Beowulf, The Simpsons Movie, and the Spiderman Trilogy to see some other reference material. All of these movies looked jaw dropping; I mean inky and deep blacks, bright and crisp whites, and vibrant and lush colors. The color gamut is very well executed on this set and with more and more usage it has been even more evident. The aesthetics of the tv are very smooth, a piano black frame envelopes the entire set with Samsung's trademark blue LED logo in the middle of the tv and a nice stand to hold everything up. I never ever thought a DLP tv could look so good, I was simply blown away at what this set could do. Playing my X-Box is pure heaven, every little detail is discernible and when you play first person shooters really puts you right into the game. When you play a death math where the screen is split into half's or even fourths it's great because everyone gets a good view of game play.But there are a few little problems with this set; first the sound the speakers produce is thin and lacking of good mid and bass range. Listening to a news cast or a show with heavy speech is ok but if you watch anything with music or large bombastic sound effects are very underwhelming. I would say the speakers are adequate, but most will use a surround sound system when watching movies, sports, or heavy laden special effects shows.  Second, this tv can be watched from any angle but the sweet spot for setting this tv is about 3 feet off the ground. Any higher or lower will make the image just a bit off, not too much but when you watch bright shows you will see a bit of a difference. Lastly, you need to have a very, very wide stand to put this tv on. The set measures about 66 inches across and would need a stand at least that big. I bought a stand that is 70 inches across and the tv sat nicely with a minimal amount of empty space on the sides of the tv. But these negatives barely effect the positives of this tv, and what you get for the prices is by far the best bang for buck tv on the market right now. I still don't understand why Samsung has discontinued this tv and dropped out of the DLP market, this set proves that DLP is a very viable technology and still has the opportunity to improve on what it has going for it. I mean when you can make a 67 inch tv for less than half the price of a plasma or LCD that rivals it in quality and features it's a no brainer! I highly recommend this tv and I'm sure if you have the space in your house you will be ecstatic with this purchase, five stars all the way!", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent performance to price ratio, best of the (dying) DLP breed", "Author": "Optimus Prime", "ReviewID": "R22186Y9JZV5Q5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung HL67A750 67-Inch 1080p LED Powered DLP HDTVBought the Samsung 67A750 at a clearance price last month, as Samsung has officially announced they are now discontinuing all DLP-based television sets in 2009. While LCD-based sets are all the rage now, DLP offers a better size to price ratio, especially if you are looking for a set in the 60\" or larger realm.The 67A750 is a spectacular performer for the price, although I expected DLP disadvantages as well. The biggest knock that I have is the viewing angles, particularly vertical - depending on the angle at which I'm watching, the display will not have consistent lighting angles. You can validate this for yourself by seeing a display model and bending your knees up and down to see how the bright points of the set vary based on exactly how you are viewing the display. It's not a deal-breaker for me, especially since it's a native disadvantage with DLP-based sets compared to LCD.Now, for the advantages - excellent black levels for DLP, very low power consumption (< 100 watts for me in actual usage when I'm viewing the set at calibrated levels, try comparing that to a similar sized LCD panel), quick start-up and power-off, LED based light bulb that doesn't have to be replaced for the lifetime of the set, and excellent picture display out of the box. Skin tones look a bit saturated and unnatural, but after some quick adjustments using the Digital Video Essentials calibration disc I borrowed from the public library, I easily fixed this to the optimal levels.Overall, I've only had this set for a month so I cannot vouch for extended performance over time, but if you read the many glowing reviews here on Amazon.com as well as the popular enthusiast site AVSforum.com, it's pretty clear the 67A750 is at the top of its class for DLP-based sets. I would probably not recommend on an extended warranty if you can find this set for a clearance price, at least if you are concerned about bulb life. The display performance is exceptional at both 1080i and 1080p, and the many connectivity options (2 HDMI, 2 components, DVI and VGA) make this a very universal tv set, very low power consumption leads to very little noise and heat (which ultimately shows up as savings on your utility bill as well), and the 17\" depth isn't too bad considering the 60.5\" width.This tv set cannot be beat for its price, although it would be unfair to compare the picture performance to the latest and greatest LCD. DLP, albeit on its dying legs, still offers far better performance/size to price ratio than any other display technology on the market. If you're shopping for a 67A750, though, you better hurry as Samsung will be discontinuing the series (and DLP) in 2009 permanently to focus strictly on LCD technology.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worked great for 3 months", "Author": "Law Chick \"MBN\"", "ReviewID": "R163DVYWA0V0U6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this tv back in November.

After only 5 years our Assembly PCB LED Drive Part number: BP94-02327A went out. Well it seems that Samsungs supplier J&J; Parts does not have the part available. It is no longer available is what they tell you! Well try Encompass, another supplier with parts! No, they too have none available and neither does EBAY if you are hoping to find an extra laying around so you can once again enjoy your television that is no longer working! So after call after call to Samsung I finally escalated my issue. That too is worthless. Samsung's answer to me was, the representative whom I was talking to said, they show on her \"notes\" that the part is backordered and no further details were available. With that, I asked, so this part could be backordered for months, which she replied yes. I said, so I already have not had a television for a month and this could be months more correct? She answered yes. I said, well, if you had spend over a thousand dollars for your television which no longer works and the company Samsung who you THOUGHT was a good company was letting you down, how would you feel? She said, I'm not allowed to share that. I said, well I can! I said, there is no one further up I could talk with. She said, no. I'm sorry, there is nothing else we can do for you. I said, really? Wow. She couldn't wait to just hang up and started to get short with me. I am totally upset with how this is being handled. I have a television backed by a company that I \"did\" believe in. Not anymore, they don't back their product. They take your money then don't supply a part to fix your product and your just out of luck. NO television, no part, no help from Samsung! YOU decide if you want your hard earned money going to a company like that! Good luck with YOUR purchase! This WILL be our last Samsung product in our household! I'll do better homework next time and research a company that has GREAT customer service of THEIR product!

I bought it in February, 2009 and still own it. The colors and resolution are better than the previous DLP that I owned (the earlier on was based on a color wheel, which after 5 years had to be replaced) - this one is LED based which (in theory) should last longer. I also own a Panasonic Plasma (50\") and have compared it with the Plasma side-by-side. The Plasma TV has more enhanced colors whereas the Samsung has more natural colors.I usually watch sports or movies and have not seen any video lag - the close-up resolution is excellent. I do not use the speakers that are on the TV but have connected the TV to a Yamaha surround sound receiver using HDMI and audio cables - also have a Blu-Ray DVD player connected and even when I play regular DVDs they seem to be very sharp. I'm not sure if that is because of the Blu-Ray player or because of the TV.What I like about the TV in addition to the above is that is light enough to be moved by one person. The delivery person was very good - he and his helper unpacked and placed the TV where I wanted it and did a basic test to see that everything was working.When watching movies, either DVD based or from cable - the HD rendering is excellent - very sharp, blacks are blacks and with very natural colors.All in all, I would strongly recommended this TV brand - my first Samsung DLP worked flawlessly for 5 years before I sold it and this one has worked flawlessly since I bought it in Feb of this year - the build quality rivals that of the other prestigious Japanese brands with a price that is a fraction of what you will pay for similar plasma or LCD TVs.Updated Oct 27, 2011 - I have downgraded my rating to 2 stars - here are the reasons. From the time I bought it in early 2009 until Sept 2011, the TV performed flawlessly - great picture. In Sept, 2011 for some unknown reason, the TV began to shut off completely after being on for a couple of hours. This interval of time began to get shorter and shorter over the next few days until it would shut off within 5 minutes of being turned on. I called Samsung - they stated the warranty for the item was 2 years and I had to pay for repairs (yup - it was 6 months over warranty) - the cost for fixing it was to be $150 for the service call plus parts for a total of $500. It took a week for them to come out and the part they replaced did not fix the problem. I paid the service charge and they ordered the 3 new parts they thought needed to be replaced. It took another 2 weeks for the parts to arrive and the service tech replaced each of the 3 parts but to no avail - same problem. One week later he contacted me to state there was another part for them to replace and it would be another 3 weeks before that one arrived. I am still waiting for the service tech to swap this new part and hoping it will fix the problem. So in all, it has been about 6 weeks that I have not been able to use this TV when it is only 30 months old. Samsung does not stock needed parts in the US and you have to wait a long time for them arrive. Needless to say, after this problem is fixed (I'll update this review when that happens), I will not be buying any Samsung products in the future - when they work they are fine, but there is clearly a durability issue with their products.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Big Samsung", "Author": "curtsworld", "ReviewID": "R1HT4439Y5LZ4D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this about ten months now with no trouble of any kind.

While it is a physically large piece, it can fit into most settings but does require a minimum seating distance of 9 feet for optimal viewing. The image via Blu Ray Discs is remarkably good, standard broadcast cable TV is passable and most DVD playback is adequate.The default values given on the internal menu do require adjusting for suiting individual tastes and can be a bit time consuming, but worth the effort. Many details are available at AVS Forum on the web for those willing to invest the time and energy to maximize video performance.I use this DLP set via HDMI into an AV receiver [Onkyo 906] and thus bypass the TV speakers, etc. This is very productive.DLP technology has evolved significantly since the earlier lamp-based systems and this HL67A750 unit shines.

However, after deciding to upgrade to a large screen television, and after viewing the plasma telvisions, I noticed the Samsung a750 televisions one day while in a store.  I could not see much difference in the picture quality between the Samsung a750 DLP and the MUCH more expensive 60\" plasma.After much research, I later purchased the HL67a750 Samsung DLP on Amazon.  I had never purchased any electronics online before and was somewhat worried but the cost of the tv from Amazon was better by hundreds of dollars than anything locally.  And with no shipping and the added benefit on no sales tax, I pulled the trigger.  The item shipped within a couple of days and was received within a week.  There was a slight delay for delivery by one business day from the projected delivery date on the order, but Amazon gave a credit to my account for any trouble the delay may have caused.  After being contacted by the delivery company by phone, they arrive exactly when they said they would and carried the television into the house and waited for me and my wife to inspect it and sign the delivery papers.  Could not have gone smoother and I was back at work within 30 minutes.Now the best part, the television is outstanding.  With the television in our living room, and a few adjustments to the picture controls, the picture is simply amazing.  The geometry seems to be almost perfect with a test grid on the screen.  We have some seating to the sides at about 30 degrees with no viewing problems (my main fear with DLP televisions).  The picture is bright, in fact turned down now to the \"low\" setting for the led light source.  We use a surround sound system and have the television's speaker turned off, so I can't comment on the sound quality.  Blu-ray movies leave us feeling like we just went to the theater.For the size and the cost, it is the best television you can get.

I now have everything hooked up and it is running through a monster power filter and the volume works twice as well so I have no complaints.

I couldn't be happier with this set unless I was twins.Update:  Now, 2 months later I still adore this TV, but have found a couple annoying things about it.  The automatic source switching function automatically changes to antenna input when you turn off the DVD/Blu-Ray player, even if you don't have anything connected to the antenna input.  It would be nice to be able to disable unused inputs from the automatic switching process.  It also has a problem if you turn on the DVD/Blu-Ray player before the TV.  That seems to put it into an error state that it cannot decode until you turn off the DVD and turn it back on again.The good (?) news is that I can now tell the difference between DVDs and Blu-Ray, which I couldn't really see with the Philips.

Sooooo, I just bought my second one! And still is the best bang for the buck. If you want want big at a modest price, if you have a medium to large room, if you don't have a lot of light coming at the screen, consider this Samsung 67.Our \"small\" 56 inch Samsung sits in a Great Room that has an 18 foot high wall mostly consisting of windows. On a sunny day the picture is good, but not great. This new one is in our lower level, which has room darkening shades. My son has christened the space as dad's \"BAT Cave\" -- short for Big A** TV. As mentioned in the specs, it is incredibly bright and rich in color. Unlike our older one, this new one doe not feed into a sound system. But (to my surprise after reading a lot of criticiism) the internal speakers put out a very good sound, especially in the TruSurround mode. In our case, room acoustics play a big part.Of course the big improvement between the two sets is that the light source is now LED-based. Samsung estimates an LED lifespan of 23 years at 6 hours a day -- I should live so long! Our 56-incher, bulb-based is in its 4th year with the original bulb. That apparently is lucky, since it is heavily used.I suggest having a sturdy credenza to set it on. I bought one 60 inches wide -- the same width as the TV. The sheer size of the screen makes it somewhat fragile, so don't put it on anything much smaller. Speaking of the screen, an important feature of Samsung's DLPs is that it is matte finish, helping to reduce room reflections. This little tidbit often doesn't show up in specs.There are plenty of inputs for DVD players, game units, etc. The \"3-D ready\" feature is probably only useful to serious gamers, since it requires glasses at $100 a pair, and a computer with a high level video card. The tuner is analog but serves my PIP usage just fine.(Amazon review editing alert:) Good news and bad news on price. Amazon generally had a competitive price as I followed the $$ numbers on shopping sites. But Amazon's prices changed wildly and frequently. I use [...] as the best tracking site since they chart each seller's price history. On this product, Amazon's chart looked like the New York skyline. I finally jumped in at one price, only to find it drop $130 before it even arrived. They graciously credited the difference on \"a one-time basis\".

Arrived with box intact. Screen is a little flimsy (for lack of a better word - only important while manually moving it) so needs reasonably careful unloading and lifting. My wife and I had no problem. Worked beautifully out of the box. Screen has about the same amount of reflection as our two 2008 Philips lcd 32\"and 42\" flat screen tvs; i.e., not a problem. Having spent considerable time reading Amazon's and other's reviews and having only passing knowledge of how to check convergence, I used the grid test pattern recommended by Mike_pro on AVS website downloading it to a thumb drive as recommended, plugging thumb drive into the usb \"wiselink\" port  (see the \"mikepro\" review of the HL61A750 on Amazon). The AVS website link is: [...]The horizontal and vertical pure black lines were perfectly parallel with no noticeable bowing on a pure white background. There is a 6\" red line at the very top of the screen and a slightly blurred red line (each barely visible in thickness) at the extreme right of the grid but have no idea if this is within normal limits for a screen this size. There is no apparent way in the menu to address this - and absolutely no negative effect on the picture. Remainder of grid was pure black lines on pure white background.As noted by others, perceived shortcomings in picture quality on high def sets are often due to broadcast shortcomings and not the set. I watched the Masters on local CBS high def station. It filled the whole screen and picture quality was superb. SD broadcasts are as good or better than the 12 y/o 50\" Toshiba rear projection this set replaced. We get a half dozen hd broadcasts on our Time Warner cable without a set top box. It is disappointing to see even hd broadcasts vary in size, often not filling the whole screen; similarly dvd movies. Seems unproductive to spend two or three times the cost of this set with this broadcast and dvd picture size limitation.The deciding factor in purchase was the LED light source in this tv replacing the usual lamp (needing periodic replacement), spinning color wheel and apparently noisy fan. (fan in our set isn't audible unless you're within 3-4 feet from rear of set). Mitsubishi is now the only company making rear projection tvs - and I believe all are the lamp-color wheel-fan technology except the $6000 laser set.In summary, just as Samsung got rear projection right, they stopped making them! If you're on the fence as we were, it's well worth jumping!Would appreciate any suggestions about where to buy a tv stand that is no more than  10\" or 11\" in height to place this on. We sit on a couch 15 feet from the set and would like the mid portion of the screen at eye level, rather than higher. Also, any comments on convergence result above and any additional checks a non-techie who can follow step by step instructions can do using on-screen menu.

You can watch movies and shows and not be bothered by it but your definitely going to want to have an external receiver system for that theater feel when watching movies.

The 3 leds on the front would sequence back to the beginning and then the set would come on.  This went on for about 2 weeks until one day they would just cycle with no picture ever appearing. I called Samsung and they gave me an rma number and a local shop called me and set up an appointment.  They came out 4 days later and replaced both the Primary and Secondary power supplies.  Repair took around an hour but now the set works great again. A couple of things....I was very disappointed this set had a catastrophic failure in under a year and live in fear now that this is a design problem with the set and it will have to be done over and over again. 2nd thing is the repair tech took one look at the set and knew exactly what was wrong with it, even brought the parts in before looking at it. This could have been because I described the problem so well I troubleshot it for him or it could be that whenever this model breaks that's the problem indicating a design flaw.

I'll leave it to others to provide specific details about how good this set is. Here is my ordeal buying this set from Amazon.Since my debit card is only good for a maximum purchase of $1500, I got the Amazon Chase credit card. It allows me to make purchases up to $5000 dollars and I don't have to make special arrangements with my bank to increase (temporarily) my debit card limit. I ordered the TV with the recommended stand and HDMI cable in a package deal. Don't make this mistake - the stand is junk. Somewhat attractive if that is your style, but very flimsy and poorly engineered, while being quite heavy and hard to move. Several of the fasteners broke since the holes were improperly drilled. I am referring to the Samsung stand made especially for the large TVs. Anyway, Amazon charged my card for the stand and I received immediate notification that it was on the way. Chase however denied the charge for the TV. After a lot of failed communication with both Amazon and chase, I found a voice mail to call Chase. They questioned why I was spending $2000 at a bookstore - weird. Yes I know Amazon started out as an on-line bookstore. I authorized the purchase and Amazon sent the set via \"White-glove\" delivery. Since I was not able to be home on the delivery date, I arranged for my sister to be here to let the crew in to unpack and set-up the set. Ha! One (smallish) man showed up to bring in this huge box, unpack it, plug in and turn it on. Remember, this is a huge 65\" set he has to put on that heavy poorly made stand. Of course he couldn't do it, so my 65-year-old sister with an artificial shoulder and recovering from ulcer surgery had to help him do his job. To say I was upset is a huge understatement.Now several weeks after my delivery, I went on-line to find out why I haven't received my billing statement so I can pay it off before I get charged interest. I discovered that the statement is over-due and they have charged my account almost $90. I assume that is interest and a late fee. I called Chase and ripped them for not sending a statement and they denied any fault and insisted that they had sent it on time. They refused to refund any charges, and they refused to accept debit card payment on the phone, on-line or any other way.For the above listed reasons, I am divorcing myself from Amazon and Chase. I'll pay-off the card and close the account. If I don't get some kind of satisfaction from the way Chase did me, and since Amazon is partnered with them, I will never visit the Amazon site again other than to use them for reviews or recommendations on products that I will buy from someone else. You can bet that my affiliation with chase is history too.", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Broke after only 10 days- Lamps might be better than LED", "Author": "bryan", "ReviewID": "R3V1TOJAAAGAWZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well I loved it when I first got it, the picture quality was great until it broke.

I am a little hesitant about getting this tv now because it is LED -originally I wanted LED because there was no lamps to replace now after this poor performing tv I think lamps would be better due to the fact I don't know if I will be able to repair this tv without spending way more than what a lamp might cost, that is if it breaks after the 1 year warranty has expired.

Replaced a Mitz 63 inch rear projector that died from the infamous \"Mitz green flickering light of death\" and of course Mitz even knowing that this is a rampant design flaw given the massive number of owners who have suffered the same fate,,,refuse to repair as it is \"out of warranty\".  So I refuse to buy another Mitz and as Samsung is the only producer of rear screen projectors, I buy a 67 inch Samsung.Picture quality is very good.  The following are issues.1.  Tuner changing channels or inputs is very slow.  I thought the Mitz was as molasses, but this makes the Mitz like 100 yard sprinter.  Of course I've owned Sony's for years, and they know how to build a fast responding tuner.2. The picture in picture support is a total joke.  Again the Mitz was far superior, but still pathetic.  In fact I hated the Mitz Pic in Pic suppport, but compared to the useless Samsung support it was a breath of spring.  Again, no one has ever done this as well as Sony(not even close).  I run 3 HD Tivo's and 2 Directv HD DVR's plus an assortment of other gear including my Parasound C1 into this monitor, and I love pic in pic when it is properly designed.  The Samsung is a \"single tuner\" and the alternate picture can only be an SD input and there is not even a button on the remote to call it up.  You must go thru a multi step process thru the menu button to call it up(there is another method but it to is moronic).3.  The shiny black border around the screen is obtrusive and rather gaudy.  Take a look on how this compares to the Mitz, who did get something right.4.  And of course the Samsung remote, just as with most other TV's does not have buttons to give direct input choices, you must scan thru the available inputs to get where you want. Pioneer has learned to do this, why are others to stupid to give this valuable feature, I do know know.  Also the same issue applies to changing the aspect ratios for the screen.  Why must one cycle thru all the different choices, especially given the slooooooooooooow tuner on the Samsung?Only 1 S-video input is really limiting, only 3 HDMI inputs, no front inputs at all for your game consoles, computers etc.  Only 2 component inputs.On the whole, Samsung builds a good picture, but their engineers should get out of their caves from time to time to find what us chickens are truly eating out here when it comes to ergonomics.Given what I now know, I should have spent the dough to repair my Mitz and waited for a later generation set(I'm waiting for a flat panel of 70 inches or more at a lower price).Bottomline.  Sony where are you when I needed you for my new set. Love your tuner and pic in pic support.  Hated your very wide monitor(because you had speakers on left and right sides making set to wide) before, and this was why my previous set was a Mitz.

We can afford something more reliable. BTW don't buy an InFocus Projector you will regret it.This posting is not specifically directed at the Samsung 65 inch LED TV but rather at the LED technology itself, because I have alot of Samsung stuff including LCD TV, Monitors etc.In the last week or so the wife and I have been comparing LCD, Plasma and LED TVs. LED is impressive when viewing animation, gaming, and graphics, but not feature length movies, sports, TV shows etc. The problem with the viewing experience is the following:1) The mode set in Dynamic mode works best for animation,gaming, graphics, etc. I agree the image is exquisite and better than either LCD or Plasma. But I have to pick up the remote and get to those specific settings.2) In the dynamic mode, while watching movies, sports, the video drags trying to catch up to the image. To me, this is like watching soap opera quality video. It gives the sense of 3D without the actual definition of 3D but rather the video lag associated with video tape.3) I can correct the above by moving the setting from Dynamic to Standard or Movie etc, but now I have to put up with same or less image quality with Plasma or LCD and I have to go back and forth on the settings. As fast as we sweep between channels in our house it becomes a diminished experience and I end up loosing the appreciation for having both options.4) The real bonus is weight and power consumption, I can only wish LCD and more specifically Plasmas could have. Price is tolerable.We decided to buy a 58 inch Panasonic Plasma and added the HD capability to our satellite and we will purchase Blu-Rau for DVDs.
