Blacks great except during movie credits it looks like an edge-lit TV with horizontal band of brightness.  Uniformity great other than movie credits and on a white screen there is minimal dimness on the left and right sides.  Shadow detail great.  Colors great.  To my knowledge this is really a 60 Hz panel, so shame on Vizio and Amazon for promoting \"effective 120 Hz.\"  I have not watched sports on it regarding Hz blur.  Ease of using software great, but not sure yet how to check on firmware updates.  Reliability and customer support?  Lack of 3D is great.  FALD is great.  I'm not a fan of matte screens, but it does help during day viewing reflections.  Cosmetics and build are fine.Conclusion, I had a Sony 55\" 900 that was among CNET's best 2013 LED TVs, and this FALD TV BLOWS the Sony away!  And for over a $1000 less and 5\" more screen!!!  Congrats Vizio on this 2014 TV!", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bought the Vizio E600i-B3 TV from Target!!", "Author": "JJM", "ReviewID": "R13UC2DABD3Y1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent TV!! Great improvement in my opinion from last year's Vizio E601i-A3. Love this TV. Out of the box the picture is not so good, but after some tweaking and adjusting the picture settings it is looking much better. I kind of expected this TV to have better contrast and overall picture quality due to the fact that it is a full-array LED TV. I don't really use the smart apps so I cannot really comment on that. I use my Roku 3 for that.Overall, this is a great TV with good picture quality once you get it setup right. The sound is also very descent for an LED-LCD TV. Can't wait for C-Net to review it!!!! Here are some settings that I used, please remember that each TV will be a bit different, but for the most part it should be close. Hope it helps someone.My Picture Settings for the E600i-B3:Picture Mode: Start with (Calibrated)Auto Brightness Control: OFFBACKLIGHT: 80BRIGHTNESS: 60CONTRAST: 80COLOR: 60TINT: 0SHARPNESS: 30***ADVANCED PICTURE***COLOR TEMP: COMPUTERBLACK DETAIL: OFFACTIVE LED ZONES: OFFMOTION BLUR REDUCTION: OFFREDUCE SIGNAL NOISE: OFFREDUCE BLOCK NOISE: OFFFILM MODE: OFFWIDE: NORMALHope that helps someone.

I doubted that was the manufacturer's intent so I removed the base and started again. Only then did I discover that the TV \"stem\" had two small nearly unnoticeable (to me) tabs that need to be hooked under the appropriate side of the base before beginning to attach it with the screws. If you look carefully, the base has two indentations designed to accept the tabs. This was not mentioned in the brief instructions included in the box, nor in the users manual available online (and on the TV itself, but not accessible there at this point).", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Vizio 60 inch smart tv", "Author": "jimbo", "ReviewID": "R11DFMHDRRP641", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just paid 850.

No 3D (thank heavens).  It has built in video apps, but I've never tried them, I just use my Roku or Apple TV.  Great picture, and the 16 dimming zones greatly enhance contrast.  The Vizio 4K sets coming out later this year will certainly have a better picture, but the 60\" 4K will be $1500 more.  Very light, easy to hang on the wall.  No \"soap opera effect\" that you need to root through menus to turn off, as you do on most competitors.  Trying to get HDMI return to turn on did take digging through non-obvious menus, and even then was unreliable -- it didn't always like to talking to Yamaha receiver -- so I used an optical cable instead, problem solved.  One dumb misfeature: despite all the internet apps, the set does not have IP control (that is, ability to be remote controlled over a wifi network using a cell phone app), you have to use IR remote control.  Before you buy, check the prices on the Vizio web site itself, they are lower than some of the 3rd party sellers.  At the time I bought mine, Amazon did not have this model in stock for \"sold by Amazon\".", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic budget big screen (comparison to the e550i-b2 and e600i-b3)", "Author": "Mizzou \"Mizzoutig\"", "ReviewID": "R9RB3UV7STSX8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I previously owned the e550i-b2 and was pleased with it, although there were some manufacturing defects (Scratches, etc.) that made me want to return the set.This model has more dimming zones and appears to be built in a slightly more sturdier frame.  I looked down the frame longwise and noticed that it is more straight then my other set.  Was this due to the other sets manufacturing defects? Possibly.  But you can't deny that this TV has a significant more HEFT then it's smaller cousin.  It's approximately 19lbs heavier, actually.Another difference is the stand.  The stand on the 60\" is stronger and allows less wobbling.  Instead of sliding a steel plate into the TV, the 60\" has the stand already installed so all you have to do is attach it to the base plate.  The end result is solid and noticeably stronger.  The mount pattern on the 60\" is 400x400 and the 55\" is 200x200, that's also a big difference.I also do not notice the vertical bars anymore on fast moving dark screens.  Overall, I'd say the picture quality is superior on the 60\".There seems to be something different with the quality of the LCD Panels and LED backlighting. I can't quite confirm that but do note these differences listed by VIZIO. 55\"=16.7 Million (10-bit)colors;  60\" =  1.07 Billion (10-bit) colors. 55\"=4 HDMI ports;  60\" = 3 HDMI Ports55\"=178' viewing angle; 60\" = 176' viewing angle55\"=15Wx2 speakers; 60\" = 10Wx2 speakers55\"= 12 Active LED zones; 60\" = 16 Active LED zonesOne CON that I have so far...I feel like I have some minor lip syncing issues going on right now....Will update further once I've figured it out.  I do not remember having syncing issues with the 55\".

Hanging on the wall (preferably with the power on), it's a work of art. The picture, with 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio is beautiful too! Menu's are simple enough, plenty of picture control, but the menu display could be bigger to make it more readable. Same with the \"Guide\". It's a small box that is unreadable at more than 12-12' away. The older Vizio's had nice full screen guide display with upcoming shows schedules (as broadcast).

Made sure it was the B 2014 model.  Brought it home and have been playing with the picture settings ever since.  Finally taking it back tomorrow.  The picture its self is very fuzzy.  My old dlp has a crisper picture.  The color has a brown and yellow tint to it and after all the adjusting in the menu I could never get it to look good.  Even with HD channels.  It looked worse when I played a blue ray.  I also had issues with the volume fluctuating from loud to quiet.
