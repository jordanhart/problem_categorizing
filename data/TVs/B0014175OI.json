{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture, DLNA shows promise, a few flaws - what's with the PIP", "Author": "Deux Bits \"These go to Eleven\"", "ReviewID": "R3THH6X25LSV2C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have only had this TV for a few days, so this is not a complete review, but I wanted to warn others about some issues that they may find important.Picture quality is great - I have not run a calibration or tested various known sources for difficult to reproduce scenes or motion. The blacks are so good that the image color looks over saturated at the factory default setting when placed next to a panel with lower contrast ratio. (It should be kept in mind that the eye has a logarithmic response to light, and a 50,000:1 contrast ratio may not be that much more than a 30,000:1 ratio.) In the store I was comparing this panel to a 46a550 and 46a530 all at their factory default settings. The 550's image was more natural looking at the factory default setting.Watching SD analog content on digital TVs can be annoying with various artifacts visible in the conversion of the analog signal to the native digital of the TV. This TV does a very respectable job of this - with the SD images mostly just looking fuzzy and soft compared to digital content - pretty much what one might expect.The TOC feature seems like a waste of time and may introduce some issues with light bleeding in from the environment. Not a problem for me in my home environment.So, if I was happy with the image on the 550 why did I get a 750? Two reasons - Motion blur: the 650 and 750 panels have higher response times and higher refresh rates thus reducing LCD motion blur artifacts, and reason two: DLNA... DNLA is a very nice feature - super nice - I hope it takes off.DLNA takes advantage of networking and media stored on a PC to provide viewable content through the TV. What's really going on here is that the TV designers are taking advantage of the computer they have inside the TV to enable them to do more digital media things with the TV. The TV has an Ethernet network interface - wireless or wired. We're computer geeks, we have a fairly robust network and my family has a strong interest in Internet downloads of various media content - in particular video. I have various foreign video content that I cannot get on a DVD. Netflix and others (Amazon, Apple, etc) have downloadable video content, although the DRM on much of this content is a problem. The rub is you have to watch this downloaded content on a PC, or a PC hooked directly up to a TV display or some other media PC kludge. DLNA helps get around some of these issues. The DLNA capability of this model is remarkable, not perfect, but still great. You have to install a piece of software on the computer that provides a way for the PC to share content on the PC through the network interface for the TV to \"see\".  On the TV, you use the W.link feature to access the shared content on the PC. Music, Images and Videos stored on the PC are all accessible through the TV.  Remarkably easy to access and view on the TV. Fantastic. There are a few glitches - The software on the PC was not able to handle all the media I threw at it in the first go around - I backed off (why would I play music through a TV?) and the software was able to complete it's build of it's database of content on the PC. I hope this problem will get cured in future versions of the DLNA server software that runs on the PC. Another small glitch was that when I decided to end my watching of these shows stored on the PC and I exited the w.link feature it appeared to crash the TV's OS. I had older firmware (1004), so I updated to 1007 and I hope this might cure the problem, although I have no evidence of this yet.So DLNA looks very promising but it is not perfect. I have not tried viewing content that is locked with DRM of some kind, but I strongly suspect this is not going to work. Further proof that DRM is seriously flawed. Legitimate users (paying customers) should not be restricted in their reasonable use of the content.The remote seems sufficiently user friendly - some lettering is large enough for older eyes to read easily and the back lighting feature works the way it should making it easier to _read_ the keys in the dark.The manual's content seems complete and readable but the manual has a major and very annoying flaw. The manual is large with many many pages so being able to refer to page numbers is crucial. It does have page numbers but I defy you to read them in anything other than bright sunlight! They are black numbers printed on a gray field. Strangest printing setup I've ever seen.  In the grand scheme of things this is only a minor detail but it is strange - the company knows about the importance of contrast. If I can download the manual as a searchable and linked pdf I won't care.I have not yet discovered a way to edit the channel description in the channel list. A few digital channels have the information on what their station ID is, but many do  not. I have not found a way to add or edit a description that tells me that, for instance, cable channel 117-25 is actually broadcast 33-1 or WBFS or some other more identifiable name.I also am not yet aware if one can apply individual optimizations to each input. If one can this would be ideal.Another minor point - I'm not too sure how \"green\" this TV is in it's energy use. I was quite surprised to discover it was noticeably warm when standing next to it while on.Finally, my two major disappointments with this TV are:1) PIP feature - which is quite limited, more like a cheesy cheap faux PIP. First, access to the PIP feature is not at all easy - one has to navigate various menus and sub menus to get at it. But the real problem is that the TV does not have a second tuner of any sort - you cannot watch two channels and swap between them without a second tuner connected through one of the external sources. In fact the PIP limits you to only being able to watch the built in Tuner content in the sub window of the main display which must be using an external source of a specific variety. Strange.... for a high end flagship product to have this kind of limited functionality... A little disturbing and makes you wonder what other cost cutting decisions one might discover with this product in the future.2) The fixed base - the base does not swivel despite what the specifications at various sites say. I'll have to get a turntable.Overall - where it matters most - the picture is spectacular. LCDs have come a long way. The picture makes me smile - it's just fun to watch.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "LN46A750", "Author": "ER \"ER\"", "ReviewID": "R26PW13M9O4HOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently have a Sony KDL-40XBR2, and wanted an upgrade, and wasn't sure wether to purchase a KDL-46XBR4 model or this new Samsung LN46A750 model.

I was just about to purchase Samsung model LNT4665 (Highest Rated) when I noticed that this model LN46A750 was released in April. Samsung LCD TV's have a great track record for picture quality and reliability, so I purchased this model even though there were no reviews posted on Amazon yet.The price is at least a $1000 lower than the retail chain stores and the FREE \"White Glove\" delivery is an added bonus. Amazon's white glove delivery means that the TV is brought into your home, carton removed and placed on your TV stand for no extra cost. At that point you can power it up and check for defects (dead pixels) before you sign the delivery receipt.Now onto picture quality. This 1080P LCD TV's picture quality is simply astounding!. The contrast levels rival that of Plasma televisions. Up until recently, Plasma televisions had far superior contrast levels. This TV has 50,000:1 contrast ratio. You can also customize color, sharpness, contrast, picture, gama and brightness settings manually if you want; just like a computer monitor.The sound quality is decent for my needs, but if you want true surround sound, you'll have to add an amplifier/receiver.This is a great buy at $2140 and change, you can't beat it with a stick!", "Date": "May 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Superb picture quality and great sound", "Author": "Kanishk Rastogi \"Freelenser\"", "ReviewID": "R96D822P70N5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing a lot of research online, in stores and reading lots of reviews at various sites like Amazon, CNet etc. I bought this TV and got it 10 days ago.A lot has been covered in the reviews here, so i will try to focus on some other points.Summary: Buy it now and from Amazon and save money.Pros:- Excellent picture quality...really superb. Beats LG & Sony for sure. There are several different modes for viewing.- Great sound. There are modes like movie, normal, music etc which are really very impressive. I decided to buy a home theater system later, since the TV itself has made a good impact on my pocket.- Amazon delivery. Very good and timely. Came on specified date and time by CEVA. Guy opened it up connected the cable and scanned the channels and let me check for working condition.- Not very heavy, so easy to mount yourself.- Tilt wheel remote..a bit tricky initially, but you will love it once you get used to it.- Contrast is excellent due toits highest contrast ratio in all the TVs in market. Check my pictures for detail.- Warranty : Samsung provides 1 year in-home care warranty for this TV. If you register it online, you get 3 months of extended warranty free.You can buy 3 years extended warranty either through Amazon (in first 60 days of purchase) or directly from Samsung (in fist 11 months of purchase). There is a significant price difference.- USB port is good and it is so easy to view pictures or movie files.  I connected my iPod (after enabling disc usage in iTunes) and it works  perfect with the TV.I am using a Monster Power Center to feed the power to TV, DVD & cable box and also for the cable signal to my cable box. It is said that it improves the picture quality esp in HD.I have mounted this TV on Bell'O FP-4850HG High Gloss Black Flat Panel Mounting System.(Read my review on the mounting system too)So far, I have not been able to take it online either with wireless or Ethernet (LAN) connection. The Wireless Key from Samsung is on nation-wide back order and TV couldn't detect my LAN settings. Need to figure this one out yet.Some people have reported issues with RED Touch of Color and reflection. I don't see these as an issue. My TV is facing a big window and I put blinds down, if reflection gives a viewing problem. However, its not that huge. You can strategically place your TV to avoid that.

Now onto aspects that might affect buyers' decision.DLNA:I did a ton of research and find the lack of information on this feature so thought I would write a review mainly on this feature.  This was the selling point why I chose this model over the 46A650.  It was a mistake.  This model present two options of video playback -- through USB and DLNA, both which failed horribly, in my opinion, because it isn't practical due to lack of codec support.The DLNA server software included with the TV is very, very slow.  I mean it!  It feels as if the software has to warm-up before it can perform the function, for example opening a folder takes about 7 seconds.  The folder had no files.  That's a pretty badly written software, you feel as you are beta-testing the software.  You can use other DLNA software such as TwonkyMedia, which is MUCH faster, to fill in the bridge but you'll run into another issue: \"This codec is not supported\", which means, for those not too computer savvy, basically means I can't play this files with this type of compression (note: compression type is not the same as file extension.).  Then reading the manual you will also noticed that each codec it supports has a maximum resolution of a certain size, else if the file movies exceed the resolution, it will spit out another error message: \"Resolution is not supported\".  Hopefully down the road Samsung will issue a firmware to add more codec support (MKV, RM, OGM, FLAC, WMV, and many others currently not supported!)  Another alternative is wait for DLNA server softwares to add support for this TV series using transcoders, similar to how TVersity re-encodes files the PS3 cannot read to codec formats the PS3 can read right before before streaming it into the PS3.  However, USB built-in video support won't ever be practical without a firmware upgrade...But, in the meantime, the feature isn't worth taking up valuable ports in my 4 port router.  Hook up your computer to your TV if you have the option, as that is still the best way to get all your movies to play.Despite all the negatives, I highly recommend this TV.  This TV deserves all the praises it gets from all other reviewers; however, don't expect it to be much different from the 46A750 in regards to feature due to the limitations.  If your decision on this set lies solely on the DLNA, pass on this and grab a 46A650 and save yourself the premium you are being charged for a broken feature.  Do note this set has built-in woofers that the 46A650 does not have.  The built-in woofer was adequate for my needs.Update:I've encountered another issue: Touch of Color peeling.  The Touch of Color peeling is when the touch of red around the TV starts to peel, revealing the color silver in my case.  This is very disturbing...Can't update my review but to me the TV is about a 3.  All the 750 potentially can have this issue so be warn if you buy this.

We are amazed at the picture. (We stepped up from a 46\" 780p DLP to this 1080p LCD) We have not been able to test it's full function at 120hz since we don't have blu-ray but with all HD sources we've tried (Directv HD, Upconverted DVDs, and XBOX 360 on 1080p) the picture is just spectacular.We were concerned about the red color around the edge, but we find that it isn't really a factor for us either way. It sort of looks like a glass top table edge with the red just inside the edge all the way around.The other issue we were concerned about from all the reviews is the glossy screen finish. This absolutely makes the picture seem sharper and the contrast higher. We have a room with many windows (not the prime setting during the daytime for screen placement but not much choice for us)  and while you can see reflections with the screen off, once it is on it doesn't seem to be any problem. In very dark shots you might see a reflection during daylight due to windows but it isn't something that bothers us at all. In fact I really have to look for it.

We researched online and in person for a very long time before making our purchase and we couldn't be more thrilled. The picture quality and additional features on this Samsung TV are amazing. Our room is very bright with lots of windows & skylights and we have no problem with glare or picture fade on this unit. Was hesitant to purchase electronics over the internet instead of at a local store, but honestly this is one of the best purchases we have ever made with not a single moment of regret.  Amazon shipped the TV very quickly, and the white glove delivery was incredible.  They set up the TV in our wall unit, made all the connections so we could check it out before signing for it, and took all the packaging away. The purchase price was lower than the local stores, plus there was no sales tax and no shipping charges. HERE IS THE BEST PART...Amazon has a price guarantee for 30 days after the TV is shipped ! The price dropped 4 times and each time I contacted Amazon the difference was refunded to me without question, saving me almost an additional $250 off my already low purchase price !!!

Look at that picture. That is what I have been saying in the last 10 days whenever I watch TV, DVD or Blu-ray.After many visits and online browsing, I was sure my next TV would be a Samsung. Sony was my brand of choice for TV for many years. I chose Samsung for picture quality and value. I was almost sure on the 46A650 until the price gap dropped to less than $100.00 and a chance to view both TV side by side on the same material at my local store. Despite many stated the different between 650 and 750 are extra woofer, saved materials in the 1GB and USB video capability on the 750, I noticed brighter picture, more contrast and more neutral coloring on the 750 compared to the 650. I am assuming both TVs had factory default setting, as in most large retail stores.Let's get the imperfection out of the way first but those are minor and not deciding factors for most.Yes, my TV was manufactured on 08/2008 and the \"halo effect\" is there. I noticed that even on a brightly lighted store. I have read on this and other sites stating Samsung is aware of this issue and fixes are in order. The halo doesn't really bother me. The clarity, life like quality of this TV won all my attention that I don't even notice the halo even at night with all light turn off. Samsung is great in customer service. I have already contacted service and a tech is going to come to my house to replace the bezel once he got the part. Even with the current bezel, I am still a happy customer.Yes, it would be nice to have the swivel base as on the 650 but this TV is so light that I can easily move it aside when I needed to connect or disconnect from the back.The transparency of this TV also may be mistakenly to be its' weakness. I noticed video signal trailing the audio signal (lip-synch) on a couple DVD but not HD or analog TV program. I contacted OPPO and found out there is a firmware update for that player. After installed the latest firmware, the issue went away. Others have reported audio signal trailing video signal. But I wonder if it is due to the other associates equipments. This TV is so transparent; it truly reproduces what feeds into it.Here are the good parts.Sounding of this TV is top notch. Of cause it cannot compares to any half decent home theater system but it beat out my two channel stereo speaker. When I first hooked up the Samsung Blue Ray BP1500, I assumed it would default to 5.1 audio with the optical connection as with Yamaha DVD and OPPO players. I end up watched Iron Man with TV speakers. After help from member of AVSFORUM, I found out the setting for sound and video on that player.Picture quality is absolutely breath taking. It is like an excellent, well set up Hi-End two channels audio system. You can hear, in this case, see the depth, color, and detail so vividly, life like. Before I received Blu-ray discs, I was watching old DVD, original and back up copies with my OPPO player. All the movies were like watching the first time since I have never seen such outstanding picture quality. (I have Sony rear projection LCD and watched many times on my brothers' Philips and Mitsubishi 1080 LCD) I couldn't detect the big different between the back up and original DVD on the OPPO. It would partially due to the edge enhancement of the Faroudja's Directional Correlational Deinterlacing processing. The OPPO player would smooth out edges and enhance imperfection on DVD. Not so the BP1500. With the BP1500, a poorly recorded DVD would clearly detect on 24Fs setting but not on lower setting. With back up DVD, I actually prefer watching the good old OPPO player but the BP1500 would provide much better 3D like image and higher contrast and detail pictures with original DVD and Blu-ray discs. BP1500 is a good match and a winner from Samsung.I am so happy with the TV. The choice on 750 over the 650 is validated again when guests and family members enjoyed those preinstalled programs on the content section. The sounding of the 750 over the 650 is easily worth the extra $50+ I would save if I purchased the 650. I haven't had a chance to use the USB or the DLNA yet.The new 850 is thinner and the 950 is surely more advance. I don't even want to check spec and watching those TV since I just can't dump another few thousands to upgrade associated equipments.With the current pricing and value provided by this 750, I would buy another one if any TV in my house needed replacement.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "If your wiring is old you will need", "Author": "Ferret Fan", "ReviewID": "R6Q9ZN405FM3B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "a very good surge protector.

I can still see the \"Halo\" effect but it does not bother my wife and I. We don't really notice it while watching a movie.- Navigating the TV's menu is touchy with the remote. Sometimes when I press a button to move to the next menu item, it'll skip to the 3rd menu item.- Some reviews state that the remote looks and feels cheap. I disagree; it looks pretty solid to to me.- The higher Auto Motion Plus (AMP) is set to, the more fuzziness we notice on some edges (e.g. the outline of a person's head moving against a background). We notice this 20% of the time while watching a movie (Blu Ray with full 1080p). Also, AMP seems a bit inconsistent; the movie will be totally smooth for a few seconds, and then it's slightly choppy next (as if AMP was turned off). I noticed this on the previous Samsung 71F HDTV model too, but this A750 model is a bit better. AMP has not fully matured but it's pretty damn good and we still use it. After watching this TV for a while with AMP on, all other TVs without the frame interpolation feature look like slideshows!- Cartoon and animated movies look AMAZING with AMP set on High. The Lion King regular DVD blew me away. Worlds different than a SD television. I could have almost mistaken the movie for a Blu Ray (using a 1080p upconverting DVD player helps).- I am confident that this is the best LCD you can buy today (this review was written August 2008). On May 2008 a professional ISF calibrator wrote:\"I had a chance to work on one of these displays yesterday.The results were very impressive post calibration. The color performance was very close to a Pioneer Elite plasma. The following report shows the measurements. This is definitely the best LCD I have worked on to date.\"If you Google that quote you will find a link to his PDF calibration report if you want real technical info.- Plasmas inherently have deeper blacks (the contrast ratio numbers are not accurate from any HDTV manufacturer) but I chose this LCD for the following reasons:  1. It's lighter.  2. It consumes less power.  3. The hardcore videophiles at avsforum still use burn-in discs to break-in their new Plasmas. Today's plasmas do not require as much break-in, but people still take precautions. I wouldn't want this nagging thought in the back of my head.  4. The black levels are already very deep in this A750 LCD. I was watching a Las Vegas cityscape scene in a movie, which is ideal for demonstrating contrast performance; ultra-bright white lights against a black night sky. Very nice in this A750.. not as deep as 2009's or 2010's OLED TVs, but still very good.- My TV randomly shut-off (with a loud thud from the subwoofers that woke up my sleeping daughter), which was very annoying, but a firmware update solved the problem. You need a USB thumb drive and you can download the firmware to it from Samsung's site. Plug the USB thumb drive in the TV and commence the update. It's very easy. I also noticed better colours (more natural and vivid) in movies with the firmware upgrade.- One reason I chose the A750 model over the A650 is the integrated subwoofer. I wanted a 'complete' sound system without having to invest in external speakers or subwoofers that will add clutter to my living room. As far as sound quality goes, A750's system is good for the casual movie watcher. The integrated subwoofer produces plenty of bass.- ATTN Canadians: I am from Vancouver, B.C. and I ordered this TV on this website and had it shipped (for free) to Blaine, Washington, just 2 minutes south of the US border. Within 1 hour I drove down to pick up the TV and I returned home. I only had to pay PST + GST. No US taxes on amazon.com. Beware that you may be asked to pay 5% duty. Regardless it's a heck of a lot cheaper than buying a TV in Canada; I saved around $1,100!===== Update August 14 2008- The \"Touch of Color\" (ToC) bezel isn't a bright red like some product photos may lead you to believe. None of my friends or families who saw the TV mentioned the red color. I pointed out the ToC to them and for the most part they responded \"Oh!\" So if you're worried about ToC being distracting or tacky in your room, don't.- The TV itself is slow at switching between video/audio sources, i.e. switching from Playstation 3 (HDMI) to a Nintendo Wii (Component) or Apple TV (HDMI) seems to take 10 seconds to complete (I haven't timed it). The screen just blacks out while switching and \"waits\" for a signal. My older tube TV was much faster at switching and I know that some HDTVs are faster than this Samsung but it doesn't bother me.- If you want to see AMP's flaws, watch one of the early scenes of a wolf chasing a caribou in Planet Earth. You'll see the caribou shake violently in some parts of the chase because AMP can't figure how to frame interpolate properly. Another good scene that exposes AMP's flaws is the Golden Eagle attacking a bird, in episode 'Mountain'. Turn down the AMP setting from 'High' to 'Low' and it's much better. Personally we leave it at 'Medium' or 'High' because we think the benefits still outweigh the cons.===== Update July 14 2009- The novelty of AMP wore off and we don't leave it on High anymore. The well-known Soap Opera effect (too smooth a motion picture) is a bit annoying. We leave AMP on Low or Medium now. The frame interpolation feature is still worth it, though, especially for animated movies. If I buy another TV I will make sure that it has frame interpolation.- I still love the TV.

I have basic cable and I use an outside antenna along with it so I can get the local channels in High Def. I was disappointed in one thing, the advertisement stated it had two RF inputs, so I am thinking yes one for cable and one for antenna.  Well when the set arrived it only had one input. I was pi--ed. Contacted Amazon by email and told them the situation and they agreed with me and gave me the choice to send back or they would give me some cash back. I could not see sending the set back because other than that the set worked absolutley wonderful. I settled with some cash back.  Also the ad states that you should get the white glove treatment with this set but I think that only pertains to people who live in a big city, my son and daughter bought the same set and they got the white glove treatment and I had to help carry the set into my house and uncrate and set it up myself.(Which was no big Deal) Butttt white gloove should be white glove no matter what.

Clarke", "ReviewID": "R3FOX06QP82Y41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all let me state that I moved my 40-inch SAMSUNG 720P TV up to the bedroom - a good set that introduced me to HDTV.  The LN46A750, however, is a stunning TV watching experience compared to the 40-incher.  Rarely do I use profanity in a positive way but the words \"Holy S..T\" just slipped out of my lips when I first laid eyes on the picture.As I annotate my experience with the LN36A750 I will try not to be repetitive of previous reviews - details as follows:Response to previous viewers:- The so-called halo effect is simply a line around the outside (top and bottom) of the glass frame that is more noticeable in the evening.  This line is the LCD picture light slipping out of the edge of the glass frame. This is not a big deal to me and has no impact on my viewing pleasure.- The TOC red line around the outside of the frame was actually surprising as it bothered a number of reviewers.  I actually thought it was a light; it is not.  It is simply a red stripe on the clear glass frame and is not at all noticeable unless there is bright light coming in from behind the TV.- Glare on screen - not an issue at all and my TV is in a well lit room during the day.Negatives:- The TV is capable of a wireless interface - this is only good if you have a CAT 5 outlet near your TV.  If not, one must go wireless.  The SAMSUNG proprietary device is severely back ordered.  It sure would be nice if this capability came with a built-in wireless function.- Sound... I have a surround sound system that does not seem completely synced with the TV sound - gives it a slight echo effect.  The TV sound alone is about as good as TV audio gets but I have it muted and use my SS system exclusively.Positives:Picture quality, picture quality, picture quality.  From the moment I viewed the full HD picture with the 120hz processor, I was blown away.  There are a million ways to customize the view and a great data point can be downloaded from CNET (tips, picture settings) to input a \"perfect\" dark room picture for the LN46A750 - it is much improved over the presets that come with the TV.  There are also three \"hardened\" picture settings known as \"ENTERTAINMENT\" that cannot be changed; kinda nice to slip over to the SPORTS setting and have a look during a baseball game - The Fenway Green Monster never looked so good.  And fast motion blurring?  What blurring?Delivery: Quick, well mannered, attention-to-detail.Price: Way better than BB or CC by hundreds = looking forward to the price dropping so I can put some more cash in my jeans with the Amazon 30-day price guarantee.Frame... or bezel as some folks call it is sleek and unique.Recommendation: If you are torn between a 650 and a 750 you might want to really research the issue.  For me the prices were so close it did not make a difference but if the 650 drops, you may want to give that a closer look.  As for me, I am in HDTV la-la land and watch shows I would normally not give a second thought to simply because of the stunning picture - very happy.Cheers!Dave", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Major design flaw", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "REFN7RWZLFEJY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the 750 series after doing a lot of research and reading a lot of reviews.  There was some comment on the \"halo effect\" but I figured how bad could it be.  Before I ordered it I went to the box store to check it out but there is so much fluorescent light and action in those stores that you cannot tell.  I just had the delivery company to my house yesterday to pick up and return the TV.  Believe me I would not have gone through the hassle of returning this if I truly didnt think it ruined the set.  This is not a minor reflection or glow only in a dark room, it is like watching another picture outside of the picture.  There is action on all sides of the bezel even in daylight.  It is especially noticeable watching sports or other programs where the full screen is taken up by the picture.  I called Samsung and they put me in touch with a repair person who basically said there is nothing he can do until Samsung comes up with a fix.  He indicated he is swamped with inquires on how to fix this.  I read some stuff about putting black tape on the back side of the TV.  This will not work as the reflection appears on the front side of the bezel.  It is truly a serious design flaw and an absolute shame, because the picture quality of the set was fantastic.  The sound was great.  The features were great.  The TV has great \"guts\" just a terrible design.  Once the 750 gets logged in as returned, I will be ordering the 650 model.

The LCDs are finally at a price point and quality that they are the good buy under 50\".  I headached a plasma, but the black levels on these LCDs are darn near as good.Specifically, this Samsung 46A750 is a fantastic TV.  I was going back and forth between this model, the 46A650 and the Sony 46Z4100.  I think the Samsung looked better in the stores.  I was really worried abut the glossy screen, but after looking at both the Sony and the Samsung in the store I did not think it would be a problem.  Essentially both the Sony and the Samsung reflect light, the Sony just makes them look more fuzzy.  In my house I have 4 windows across from my TV kind of diagonally and it has not been a problem.  If anything the frame is more reflective than the screen.I picked the 750 over the 650 mainly for the DLNA function and the subwoofer.  I have not used the DLNA functions because I ended up getting a PS3 which is better for that.  I have used the USB input to play MP3s and show pictures which has worked very well.  I wanted the subwoofer because I just don't have room for the TV and speakers on the stand I have.  In my opinion the sound with the TV is very good.  The Sony may be better but this is more than adequate.The picture is wonderful!  I have it hooked to Dish HD, a WII, and the PS3.  All look exceptional on this LCD!  I have yet to find anything wrong with this TV, oh the remote is a little annoying but usable.  The 120 HZ and automotion is very smooth.  I have not had this before so yet to see how well I like it.  The TOC red is not obnoxious at all.  I think it is very pleasing and does not distract.  The picture also looks good from most angles.  It is one of the best for off-angle viewing.I was close to buying the Sony because of the free blu-ray player but waited.  When Amazon had the free Samsung BD-P1500 blu-ray with purchase I went for it!  The shipping was fast and CEVA was very good.I am very glad I got the Samsung.

I was looking at three different TV's since January of 2008 and decided on this one because it looked the best in my opinion.  I was really headed toward going for the new LED technology in the 4081 then looked at the Sony XBR's but decided to go with this one because it gave me more bang for the Buck.  I looked at the 650 but couldn't stand the way the bezel looked and the 750 bezel looked so much more pleasing to my eye.I know a number of people out there complain about some \"halo\" effect when looking at the TV at night but I have yet to see it on my set.  A number of other people have complained about not having the Wireless adapter that you can order from Samsung but is out of stock...Well my co-worker recieved one for free in the mail without even inquiring about it after he registered his TV.  He purchased two TV's and I don't know if thats the reason why he received the adapter for free or not, but I hope they send me one also, if not, that's fine because I have my TV located right next to my router.In closing...I love my TV, it's color, bezel and more than anything else it's Picture which is more important to me than anything else.

We have the 46\" model and the picture is so vivid and large that my wife was wanting to back up further in the room (though she has gotten use to it now).We normally don't watch the news or nighttime shows but when turning on a 1080 high def channel, it's hard to turn it off since the picture and colors are just so good, we end up watching things we normally wouldn't just because the picture is so good.We also still watch a decent amount of standard def shows on this tv since we haven't upgraded our DVR and everything else yet, and the tv does a good job of upscaling and rendering the pictures on the large screen. We'll certainly want to get everything possible in high def in the future, but in the meantime it does a great job of upscaling while we are in transition. I do not have a Blueray player yet to try out the 1080p video yet, but the 1080i from the small antenna we have is just amazing!We ordered it in time for the Olympics and are enjoying every minute of it (in 1080i). The color, sharpness are just phenomenal. The 120hz refresh and smoothing handle full motion very well. What a wonderful TV!Some people in the forums have mentioned a problem with a little glare around the edge of the tv (reflection on the exterior edge of the glass frame), but honestly it isn't a problem for us. We currently have the tv on its stand at eye level (without tilting down which would get rid of issue) and it's almost not even noticeable, certainly not anything we'd complain about.The extra features of this model over last years include being able to watch video (in addition to photos and music) off the usb port or via the network (using software on your pc). We haven't tried sharing from the pc yet (but plan to), the display off the usb works great. We've already taken photos and videos from our cameras, copied to usb flash drive and plugged into tv for instant slide shows and movie viewing.This model also has additional content like built in slide shows, cooking recipes, and workout content. The built in slideshows are wonderful having some Monet artwork and some awesome landscape photographs with accompanying music. It's just beautiful and the content can potentially be updated from Samsung (according to the manual). This is just a start of what could be done with content for this TV, I hope that Samsung and/others will continue to make more for it. It even has some stories, songs, and games for the kids.It also can instantly fetch the weather, stock prices, and blog news entries (complete with photos) and display on the screen over what you are watching. This works great for checking the weather, news, stocks, etc. while waiting for a show to come back on.Built in sound is pretty good, many people will probably go with a receiver to handle the sound, but the in the box speakers and subwoofer do a decent job for us.Amazon white glove delivery was great! No problems with tv, they set it up and helped us check that it was undamaged and was acceptable before they left. We had no dead pixels and it was in perfect condition.We researched and checked out many models and other brands before choosing this tv and as for right now, I believe this is not only the best value HDTV for this size, I have not seen any TV that is better in terms of picture quality, contrast, sharpness, etc. The forums are full of other happy customers like me which all had similar reports.

So far, I can't even begin to tell you how accurate this picture is, using the settings from an online reviewer, this is almost on par with a comparable plasma, colors are very natural, the motion hardly blurs, and the size really does bring that to almost lifelike proportions.  Also, for a high-end LCD, this does have some of the best sound qualities that I've heard out of anything we own.  This is unheard of for Samsung to have this good of sound.Setup was very easy, got a chance to configure this using Cnet's settings, in Movie Mode, with all the tweaks that they provided.

I own a first-gen Premium console, and now am forced to look into a VGA setup, or trade this in and go for an Xbox Elite just to get a console that this set can support.I still admit, for an LCD, the black levels on this can really rival that of a plasma, albeit not quite as deep as a Pioneer, but pretty darn close.

It came down to this model and the Sharp Aquos special edition.  (LC-46SE94U).On paper they're very similar products both with different advantages.  Samsung has an extra HDMI port while Sharp has free internet diagnosis. (hook your tv up to the internet and Sharp can fix your tv remotely if anything ever went wrong with it.)On paper I was sold on Sharp.  But then I went and looked at the tvs in person to check picture quality. The Sharp didn't even compare to the Samsung.  I changed the settings to make sure they weren't trying to sell one over the other. (I'm skeptical about retail stores) This Samsung has a picture quality like no other LCD.  The blacks are as deep as plasmas. There can an issue with glare because of the glass over the screen... but if you're smart about where you place your tv in relation to your windows... this is not an issue.Now this is the best part everyone needs to know... because I didn't realize it until someone told me.  Amazon.com has a 30-day post-order price guarantee.  I purchased this tv for $2,074 and within 30 days it dropped down to $1,824.  I saved $250 after I bought this tv!!!  Amazon was very helpful and didn't mind at all that I emailed them every day the price dropped asking to refund the difference to my credit card.  (you obviously have to contact them each time it drops, they won't do it automatically)  Just make sure you buy it from Amazon.com and not one of the sellers they sometimes promote because they won't honor the guarantee.You simply cannot go wrong with this TV.

Samsung has done a great job of taking a every day product and turned it into a work of art.The picture quality is excellent, there are plenty of dvi inputs; I have no problem hooking up my AppleTV, PS3 & Direct TV box.I bought a few blue ray movies (play them in my PS3) and they are amazing!

The PS3 games look equally amazing as well, if you play games you'll be blown away playing on this tv.The only two things that I don't like about the tv  are the remote.  Its been mentioned here the remote is a little funky, and it is.  They tried to implement a iPod style click wheel, but to be honest its pretty lame.  The other (also mentioned here) is the white edge the light reflects thru, its not that bad, but I cant help imagine how much better it would look without it.Now let me be clear... neither of these are deal breakers by any means!!!!

Best way to describe it is that it is like buying beautiful blown glass and a very deep red that was almost black was in the clear glass melting into black.Other issue I read a lot about was the Halo - unless you are so overly touchy and watch the tv in complete dark and probably have some sort of easily distracted personality issues - you will never even know what someone is talking about.

I have 6 devices connected to it:(1) Sony HTCT100 Sound Bar W/Sub-Woofer (connects 3 HDMI devices to tv)(2) TW Digital Cable Box (2 connections: HTCT100: HDMI SAT, TV: Component)(3) Sony Playstation3 (HTCT100: HDMI PS3)(4) JVC XVN670B upconvert 1080p DVD Player (HTCT100: HDMI DVD)(5) Dell SX-280 2.8ghz pc w/wireless keyboard (tv: HDMI/DVI)(6) ReplayTV RTV-5040 PVR 320GB (tv: component)I also purchased a Harmony One remote to control all these devices, and it does a splendid job. I have my TW digital cable box set up so that it just uses tv input for regular viewing (via component), and the option to use the nice Sony HTCT100 (via HDMI) when watching movies, etc. For the PS3, I bought a PlayStation 3 Blu Wave so that the Harmony One could communicate with it.As far as the halo effect, the only time I think about it is when I read the reviews here. My LN46A750 sits about 12 feet away from me at about 45\" eye level. As far as window glare is concerned, there is very little. So for me, the halo effect is a non-issue.The ethernet connectivity, along with DLNA support is great. Many people have had problems with Samsung LN46A750's DLNA capabilities, so I didn't bother trying it for myself until just recently. PlayOn has a service whereas you can watch Netflix, Amazon VOD, Hulu, CBS, YouTube and ESPN directly from your Samsung LN46A750. However, for this to work, you need a computer which is at least a dual-core 1.5ghz. I personally just use my Dell D620 2.2ghz dual-core laptop. I am using a Linksys WRT54G2 Wireless-G Broadband Router. Under router settings, make sure to enable UPnP and Filter Multi-cast. Both my Dell D620 running PlayOn and Samsung LN46A750 are connected via cat-5 cable. Also, my LN46A750 is set up to receive automatic IP address, not static.I have broken down using PlayOn into 2 steps:(1) PLAYON SET UP (2) PLAYON VIEWING.The REFERENCE section is located near bottom of this review. Actually you should read it first before installing PlayOn. Learnng PlayOn is somewhat confusing at first, but it will soon become second nature for you. It is well worth the time and effort.==========================================================================Step (1) PLAYON SET UP:Download Playon's software to your computer from [...]After installation and verifying Playon Media Server is Running (see REFERENCE section below), your computer now becomes a server to your Samsung LN46A750.==========================================================================Step (2) PLAYON VIEWING:Turn on just your LN46A750 and press the W.LINK button on the remote. You should see a WISELINK Pro menu with Photo, Music, Movie and Setup icons. Using your Samsung remote, click GO RIGHT until you reach the Movie icon. On movie icon, click the ENTER button. Sometimes it takes a second for remote command to take place on screen, so be patient.You should now see folders for Netflix, Amazon VOD, Hulu, CBS, YouTube and CNN. The folder you are currently on is larger than the ones beside it.Next, practice by accessing latest \"The Academy\" episode under Hulu:Click ENTER on the Hulu folder, and message \"UPPER FOLDER\" appears. Click GO RIGHT until you are on TV Episodes folder, then click ENTER. Again, UPPER FOLDER shows. Click GO RIGHT until you see the A Folder, and click ENTER. UPPER FOLDER shows. Then click GO RIGHT and click ENTER on The Acadamy folder. UPPER FOLDER shows. To the right you will see actual episodes (Movie camera icon). Click GO RIGHT to the first (latest) episode, and then click ENTER. Once selected, a count-down pinwheel with message \"Preparing to Play\" appears in righthand corner. It takes about 8-10 seconds for pinwheel to go full circle. The selected video may start within 1-3 seconds, or the pinwheel may go full-circle twice before show starts. It doesn't seem to follow any particular pattern.Okay here is where the confusion arises... the pin wheel may go full circle, either once or twice, and message \"NOT SUPPORTED FILE FORMAT\" appears. If this occurs, immediately press RETURN (twice) very quickly. Sometimes, it works better to click RETURN twice quickly, then once more a split second later. The object is to back up one step, so that you can re-select episode by clicking ENTER again. For whatever reason, your desired show will activate fine the second time. This happens fairly frequently, but is an easy issue to deal with.Once your ahow has finished, you can either press EXIT to return to WISELINK Pro main menu, or click RETURN a few times to return to Hulu's TV Episodes menu. Each time you click RETURN backs you up one step.TIP: You can either click GO RIGHT for latest episodes, or GO LEFT for earliest episodes. You can also use yellow button on your remote to mark several episodes so that they will be viewed consecutively.==========================================================================REFERENCE SECTION.Playon settings:To get there, either double-click on PlayOn shortcut icon on your computer desktop screen, or go to Start/Programs/Playon/PlayOn Settings. Under Playon settings you have 5 tabs, with General Settings, System Check and User Accounts being most used.Under General Settings tab, make sure Playon Media Server is Running (Green Light). If not, click the Start/Stop PlayOn server button to start service. Green light appears within 5 seconds.Under User Accounts tab, fill in your info if you have Netflix account. If you have not already done so, you should go to hulu.com/youtube.com and sign up there. Enter your hulu and youtube info under Hulu Account and YouTube Usernames, respectively. Make sure to test your account(s) by pressing Test button.Samsung remote:Navigation wheel is located in center of remote. On the outside of this wheel, you can move about by clicking GO UP/GO DOWN or GO LEFT/GO RIGHT. The button in middle of this wheel is the ENTER button (also used as Pause/Continue during PlayOn play back). The W.LINK button is located right of green MENU button, or just above RETURN button. During PlayOn viewing, correct use of RETURN and EXIT buttons is important. Use RETURN to back up one step, use the EXIT button to return to original WISELINK Pro menu.-----------------------------PS.

The blacks are deep, off-axis viewing is great and I have only seen some small blurring and flickering issues playing Blue Ray movies that I think a owner who fine-tunes and calibrates the settings would probably eliminate.The red TOC design is not distracting at all but it is red and you do see it - it could look bad in a room with non-red colors.I have had no issues with the halo effect many have discussed so far and I have the TV on a standard height TV cabinet in a normal room. This hasn't effected me yet. Reflections in my \"normal\" room also seem to be no problem.The DLNA networking capability to access your PC media through the TV is nice but I get the same functionality with my Playstation 3 and it is a blue ray player as well and it works wirelessly out of the box. The 750 requires you buy an optional attachment to join your home's wireless network. So if DLNA is the only reason you buy this TV you may want a cheaper model and a PS3 so you can play games, watch blue ray movies and access your PC wirelessly with no additional purchases required.The PIP observation of not having a second tuner, thus limiting you to watching the tuner content in the sub-window while the main picture is a blue ray, VCR, DVD or game console input, has not been an issue to me. The manual describes this as a way to watch a tuner picture while you do someething else (or vice versa); it is not to watch two channels simultaneously. This has not impacted my experience at all.The bottom line reason to buy this TV is it has a fantastic picture and it really delivers.I bought my TV from Amazon and it was delivered by \"Pilot\" shipping. The TV came early, the box was in super condition and the Pilot delivery people were superb, bringing the TV into my basement, checking it out, cleaning it and hauling away the trash. The delivery service (which was my biggest worry in my first $1000+ internet purchase) was the best I have ever had!

Out of the box stunning quality...no really, stunning. The Touch of Color is stylish but never distracting and any screen reflection issues can be avoided with a little common sense. The built-in sound quality is good, but I did opt for a Samsung theatre system. I followed-up with a professional screen calibration and found that the brightness was toned down, which released stunningly natural colors and vividness. Set-up was painless, and since I matched the LCD with other Samsung components, the simplicity of using one controller to rule them all delivered the ease-of-use promised via Anynet+.

There are plenty of adjustments to tailor the image to the specific content if you want really precise control, but the presets do a really nice job. The dynamic/contrast range of this TV is incredible. The downside is you start to realize just how bad much of the standard content picture quality really is! Watching movies in HD is perfect. If the content doesn't use the full frame, it is very simple to select from several zoom options to avoid picture distortion.I experimented with the D.Link content (weather, stocks, news) overlay on the picture - this is a nice way to browse some additional content without interrupting the program you are watching. The remote is easy to work with once you take a couple of minutes to figure out the logic. (It would be nice if the remote could also control the basics of a cable box, but the Comcast remote actually works fine to control the main functions of the TV.)In the run up to purchasing this product, I looked at all of the different models that I could. In several different stores with different content, I picked the Samsung 6/7 series sets out as best.

Bergler", "ReviewID": "R369KEYX0RK133", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV as I felt that the technology has finally matured to the level that I would be satisfied with and I am satisfied with the 750-series. My minimum requirements for an LCD HDTV are 120 Hz frame rate, 4 ms response time, 50,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio and of course full HD (1920x1080 pixels) and this unit offers all of these. I do not have a BlueRay HD-player to see how 1080p would look, but satellite signal at 1080i looks smooth and sharp.I did not think I would require more than 2 HDMI connections, one for the signal from a surround sound receiver and another for X-box/PS3-games for my kids. But I had not decided on the SS-receiver yet. The 4 HDMI and 2 component connections proved to be very useful. My older satellite receiver only had component and S-video. I used the latter for my old setup, which on HD looks terrible. The direct connection through component input improved the image tremendously. I suspect that this unit does video signal upconverting very well. When I finally get my SS-receiver and connect to my system I will be able to compare which one does better upconverting.Unfortunately, when you switch from component to HDMI, you have to press several buttons on the remote. First where the video comes from, then the audio. Maybe if I use a different port you do not need to do this, but I ordered a Logitech Harmone 550 to eliminate the 6 remotes that I have for the 6 devices just to simplify changing devices especially for the kids and wife.The sound from the TV speakers is just great if you do not intend to purchase a surround system. But since I will be getting a 7.1 surround system, I have turned the sound off on the TV.The USB-port works great. I placed an MPG-file and one DVD-file showing Shakira's Hips Don't Lie live performance in Germany on a memory device, and it recognizes them automatically. You could easily select them to play and it plays them nicely.What I did not know was that there is a special offer from Samsung, which is not advertised anywhere, that if you buy a unit of 650 or 750 series before a certain date, you will get a wireless device to connect the TV to your network at home (DLNA) for free. This allows me to play movies at a computer on the network and display it on the TV. I found out about it at Audio Video Science Forum. I should be getting it soon. Video, I read about, may not play with MS Windows Media Player, but who uses this any ways? At least I do not as there are better media players such as PowerDVD and WinDVD on the market. Let's see if any of these works.Has the shiny screen bothered me? I have located this unit next to a huge sliding glass patio door facing north and I have not seen any annoying reflection. Maybe if I place it opposite of the door I will. The only thing that shines into my eyes is the late afternoon sun in the summer, in which case I just close the curtain.At a store, when you walk by HDTV's even LCD-units, you will notice the heat emanating from the screen. Having watched TV for a while, I do not notice the heat on this unit. Maybe if I keep it on for an entire day will I notice it, but so far, having watched 4 hours of TV in the summer, I am pleased to say that it did not add significant heat to our living room.There is many more features that will take time for me to explore. The RSS-feed is one of them when you connect it to the internet.When I bought this unit, I noticed that Amazon was selling the older model, the 650, for a hundred dollar less. It was therefore a no-brainer for me to get into this, especially since Amazon will price match a lower price. It was perfect timing since I have not seen a lower price on this unit after I bought it. I am comfortable spending about $1800 on this unit, unfortunately shipping is $150 extra. I saw a lower priced unit from a camera store in New York, but I rather go for no-hassle, customer-friendly purchase at Amazon. A lower price on this planet, BTW does not mean you will get a refund from Amazon. Buying from Amazon gives me a better peace of mind, just in case. Since I bought the unit with my Visa-card, the warranty is doubled to 2 years.I like this TV and only time will tell when it requires replacement.

Mastro \"just some guy\"", "ReviewID": "R2XWGP04RTZD5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am still extremely impressed with this television one year into ownership.  The picture quality is simply outstanding, and it looks great hanging on the wall.It has a built-in sub-woofer which helps the sound quite a bit (this is a step up over the 650 model).  We almost always listen with just TV speakers, so it was important to me.  However, at low volumes, the sound is a bit 'tinny', which is par for the course with thin TVs.  Overall, I'd say the sound is top-of-the-line for a flat panel TV, so don't let this deter you.  Listening at normal volume, the sound is better than the large CRT we were using before.Some people complain about a 'halo' around the edge of the screen, and some cosmetic peeling of the 'Touch of Color' (inside the glass of the bezel).  These things exist, but they don't bother me.  The halo is easily solved if it irritates you (just search around, there are a couple ways to do it), and the peeling is so tiny, I can't believe how much people were commenting on it.  You can't even see it unless you're right next to the TV and looking for it.  Maybe we just have a mild case of it.The glossy screen concerned me before I purchased - it almost kept me from pulling the trigger.  I don't regret it in the least.  Now, when I'm looking at TVs for other rooms in the house, I find I WANT a glossy screen because of how attractive it is and how deep the blacks are (note - I don't care for them on laptops because of glare).  However, be wary if there are lots of windows in the room that shine on the TV.  If you're sensitive to this, it could bother you.  (I still think it's worth it, personally.)I also use the TV for gaming (Playstation 3).  I don't bother putting the TV into 'game mode' (which it has), and have zero problems with lag.  Maybe I'm not that sensitive, but I've never noticed any lag at all, actually.  I keep my AMP (Auto Motion Plus?) setting on 'Low'.  Higher settings seem to cause erratic visuals in fast moving scenes, and I suspect will cause some display lag as it does the extra processing.Purchased from Amazon, which was no hassle at all (I was concerned about buying a big ticket item online).  I won't hesitate to buy a TV from them again.  We had zero dead pixels, so no returns were necessary.Finally, note that there is a newer model of this TV (the B750) which is apparently also excellent (I did some quick research).  Although I have no first hand experience with it, it's possible the B750 has a bit more lag than the A750 (if you're looking to use it for any kind of gaming).  Honestly, I sincerely doubt that's an issue and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it.I'm thrilled with my purchase after a year, and would buy again in a heartbeat if the need arose.

Unfortunately, I haven't taken advantage of using every feature this TV has to offer, but I think I have experienced enough worthy of a review.First of all - the TV alone, without even being turned on, looks just breathtaking. The look is sleek and fits so well in my living room.Beginning with the set-up, it was a snap.  There's a \"plug & play\" feature that sets things up for you with the TV stations and channels.  I use an RCA flat antenna that picks up HD local stations.  When the guys delivered the TV and helped set it up (which was very professionally done, I might add) we set up the stations, played with the picture settings a bit and I was off and running.I had no trouble at all hooking everything up to the back of the TV, but I do not have as many peripherals as some people.  I just hooked up my audio cables that go out to my receiver, the antenna to the coaxial and my PS3 to the HDMI.  There are plenty of inputs for whatever you may want to hook up to the TV.Since I've never owned a TV that was 1080p HD, I was practically salivating at the thought of seeing \"The Dark Knight\" in BluRay on this TV.  All I have to say is WOW!!  This was the first thing I watched within 30 minutes of having the TV, and I sat through the entire movie in awe.  Not just because of the quality of the movie, but the picture quality of the TV.As others have mentioned in their reviews, the colors and whites/blacks are incredible.  I remember reading reviews about how \"whites are white and blacks are black...\"  I didn't truly understand that until I saw it for myself.  I think the picture quality is just flawless and even though I took some pictures, nothing compares to seeing it in person.One thing I'd like to point out as almost a negative is the 120Hz thing.  Now, whenever I would go into a store to look at this TV, it would be turned on.  I think it works well for sports and maybe some video games.  But there's just something very unnatural about it, in my opinion, when watching regular movies or TV shows.  Others have made similar comments in their reviews, but for me I have not yet had an experience of using that setting that I liked.  It's not really a flaw...  just a feature I don't think is useful except for sports (perhaps?) which I do watch, but not as often as movies or TV.In case you can't tell by any pictures, the tv DOES have controls on the lower right side of the front.  It's all touch-sensitive controls (not sticking out) with power, channel up/down, volume, menu and input. You can't really see it but they're there. kinda neat, in my opinion.ToC - Touch of color... looks nice.  Doesn't bother me at all and I like it.  Very subtle.TV sound - is okay I guess.  I used the TV speakers just once, to test when they set it up, but I use a nice Samsung 5.1 home theater and it's just incredible.  I have no real experience using the TV sound by itself, but others have mentioned displeasure in it.  I can't really comment though.The remote - well, it's okay.  Not the worst but not the best.  I love the buttons... very comfortable and easy to memorize the most commonly used buttons.  but the wheel thing?  That's somewhat worthless.Speaking of worthless...  PIP!  Not worth even using.  Just imagine this TV doesn't have PIP.  You can't swap and the PIP is always a fixed 16:9 ratio, stretching the picture, even if that channel is set to 4:3.  I'm not really a PIP guy though so it's not really something I'm worried about, personally.I wanted to give this TV a 4.5/5 but since amazon doesn't let you do halves, I have to give this TV a full 5/5 stars for everything from the speedy delivery and professionally handled in-home set up to the amazing picture quality this LCD puts out for both blu-ray movies and video games.  Guitar Hero has never been so fun and BluRay movies have never looked so beautiful! :)I hope my review was helpful.------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:  So I just watched my first NHL hockey game in HD on this TV and am now watching my first HD basketball game.  The 120Hz makes a HUGE difference in the viewing experience and i LOVE it.  It's already Hi-Def so the picture is obviously immaculate.  But with the 120Hz turned on (and I have it on \"high\") it makes everything seem so smooth and seamless as the action goes from side to side.  I've never seen anything like it.  It almost feels like I'm there.", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Impressed", "Author": "P.

Crane - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)The Samsung LN46A750 is an amazing television. I researched televisions for a few weeks before purchasing it. The Amazon reviews made it seem too good to be true so I just wanted to add my review to that category. If you want a sub $1500 46\" television than this is THE way to go. Pros and cons follow.Pros: Picture. I have been watching it for a few weeks and even with Time Warner HD the picture is absolutely perfect - clean, clear, colorful. Looking forward to a PS3 with Blue Ray movies to really stretch its HD legs.120 mhz. I read contradictory opinions on this. Should you spend a little more to get a TV with it? Yes. When I first got the TV 120mhz was on and I didn't like the way films appeared.  Titanic (girlfriend wanted to watch it, really) looked \"fake\" and had a cheesy feel to it.  I turned it off and it looks great.  I do turn it on for sports and Survivor however because it makes you feel like you are on set behind a sheet of glass.DLNA: I am a techie and love this kind of stuff. A networked TV? Great! I have a server running Playon to stream Netflix and Hulu and I actually use the included Samsung Sync to stream AVI files to the TV wirelessly. The Sync software could use a touch of refinement but it works better than others I have tried: TVersity, Vuze, etc. 700MB files look awesome. They are the proper screen size. Lots of potential here untapped.Cons: Huge problem on week 3. The TV no longer powered on :(. Have to admit I was frustrated. It happens I guess and could have been anything from a surge to faulty parts but this is the true test of a company - are they behind you? Samsung support was a great experience. Talked to someone and had a service call in under 15 minutes. Tech was there a few days later, replaced the mainboard (upgraded one no less) and was out. The tech was extremely friendly and professional. Back in action but I'll be getting the extended warranty from Samsung, that was scary. Going back to a standard def analog tube is awful after tasting HD.All the other stuff you can read about in the reviews and specs so I'll cut this short. If you want the best TV in this price range this is the TV to get. I am very happy with this purcahse.", "Date": "March 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "TV is great, but Amazon disappoints...", "Author": "I.

I knew that before I received it since I went to BB for side-by-side TV comparisons. People that have no intention of making the purchase from local stores should still go to their local electronic stores to see the difference for themselves.Plenty of praises have been said already, so I'm just going to mention why I chose the 750 over 650. One, I live in a one-bedroom apartment without adequate sound-proofing between apartments. So a dedicated theater SS was out of the question. With the built-in woofer, however, it added depth that I missed from 650 which my brother has. Two, I can play videos from flash drives whereas I can't on 650s (Though I hear later model 650s can?). And soon I'll set up the built-in DLNA which I know I will use a lot. Finally, The difference in price at the time I placed the order was less than $50.00Now, on the Amazon debacle. The TV I have now is a replacement, so, yes, in the end, Amazon delivered. But it took a month of back-and-forth emailing and calling. I had some doubts that the TV I initially received was fresh out of the box. Many of the screws on the back -totalling 9- had visible scuff marks. It had fingerprints all over the screen, and the remote came with its side split. Just signs of tampering everywhere. I relayed this message through email, and the response I got was, \"We can't replace the whole TV for scuffed screws that cost just 79 cents each.\" (Yes, they actually said, '79 cents.') Instead they wanted to send me a new set of screws. Now, why would I ever want to replace the screws on the TV that may mess up the TV and ultimately void a warranty? So I asked for a refund, and I also promised to contact the BBB, and they changed their tune a bit. Or perhaps someone in a better mood than the \".79 dude\" decided to answer my email this time.

Not really a huge problem, I'm just nitpicking at an otherwise beautiful display.Updated woofer adds deeper sound output which can benefit those not using external speaker setups.Halo effect is definitely present around the borders of the bezel, but in my opinion, is noticeable only if: 1. you are looking for it, and 2. if you are viewing it in the dark.  With a light source next to/behind, this effect is not noticeable.I would say I only have two complaints.  1. I wish I would have been able to afford the 52\" 750 and 2.

My previous Sony rear projection TV had problems displaying with the blinds up which was one of the motivating reasons for changing to an LCD.  I was concerned about the effect of the windows against the glossy surfaces of the LN46A750 but found that the brightness of the display overcomes the brightness of the windows such that while viewing, the windows to not negatively impact the viewing experience.  I guess that its the 50,000:1 contrast ratio spec in play here.I have the display connected to my PC, DVD (gonna go Blue ray soon) and HD Cable through the HDMI inputs.  All viewing is exceptional.  Gotta say that the PC connection is the most astounding.  When viewing a slide show, some of the better quality pictures appear 3 dimensional.Consumer Reports said that image quality @ viewing angle was not the best so I investigated that and came away with a \"huh\"?  I detect no degradation at any angle that I would care to view the display.Only negative thing is on me, should have bought the 52 incher for my room.

I researched TV's for about 3-4 weeks looking at all specs, etc. The things I loved most about this TV were its build quality, the future proofing (120Hz refresh rate) and the cost vs size. The picture quality of this TV is GREAT (of course a big difference is ALWAYS the source of the program you are watching).A couple things I would recommend...If you buy this TV online during the winter time in an area that gets cold, MAKE SURE you let it sit for at least 3-5 hours before you turn it on. Many places online state 24 hours (which I think is a little excessive). This allows for any moisture from the cool air to dry off of the pannel inside the TV if any is present.The second thing I recommend is upgrading the firmware to the latest and greatest from Samsung's website. The firmware on mine was factory default from the initial release of the TV.Other than that, I have LOVED the TV. One thing I will advise is that you get a blu-ray player.

Showed up on time in a very professional manner.  Took the TV out of the box and placed it on the stand.  Then made sure it powered up!  They will take away your box but I recommend to keep it in case of a return.  Overall, this experience was great - I have a great TV and I saved about $400 buck a roni's!

Obviously not as good as when hooked to stereo, but acceptable for most things.Cons:  - remote is rather long - I'd opt for smaller buttons instead of the 10\" (or whatever) length. Also, the scroll wheel is kind of awkward - try to press right or left with it, it tends to scroll first.  - No swivel base (don't know if the product description says it has one or not - just assumed it would, since my older Samsung has one)  - Timer - can only select Cable or Air input for timer operation (on at 6AM, etc), not HDMI or anything else.

After setting me up with the wrong local service, wasting a lot of time, they connected me with a local repair shop that ordered parts without checking to see what was wrong first! Of course they were the wrong parts. The request to Samsung to comply with the rule they had given me that they allow 3 weeks for repairs and then replace the item fell on deaf ears. There is no commitment from them on a time frame to do anything about it, so we are at the whims of the Gods...

When it finally came time to buy ourselves an HD, he did a lot of the research, being more technologically inclined than I am.  After reading rafts of reviews, he suggested that we purchase this model.First and foremost, the picture quality is phenomenal.  There are issues with glare, so we do have to keep the blinds directly across from the TV closed for the most part but that's a very minor annoyance in comparison with the richness of the colors and the depth of the picture we now enjoy.  Sports in particular are breathtaking on the screen and sitting and watching in your living room truly does feel almost like being there when watching an event through this model.  We haven't progressed to the Blu-Ray phase yet but the picture quality of our DVDs is also quite nice.One of my favorite features of the TV is the USB port.  It's so easy to plug a USB stick into the side of the TV and view pictures, watch videos, play music, etc.  I didn't fully realize the potential of this feature until we got the TV and began to use it in earnest.  We now frequently make use of it.The USB port is also handy for the home A/V kit that came with my recently purchased Microsoft Zune.  Thanks to the subwoofer that's built into the TV, the sound quality is quite good.  I can easily connect the A/V kit to the TV and use it to play music on my Zune while I'm doing things like cooking and cleaning and I also frequently use it to play music for my daughter while she's playing.  Again, this is another feature that I wouldn't really have thought about but now that I have it, I find it pretty indispensable.The overall look of the TV is very sleek and the slight hint of red along the edges helps give it an elegant look.  I never found TVs particular attractive in the past but I'm happy now to have something that looks good in my living room, even when it's turned off.

The built in speakers are quite good and more than sufficient for me as i live in an apartment and i dont watch tv at high volume.The only complaint i have is with the software that samsung provides to stream music, video and pictures from your computer to the TV. The setup was easy, but it takes a couple of minutes before the songs are played. I tried it a couple of times and the result was the same. Samsung really needs to improve on that aspect.

I was a little nervous when I received it because I kept reading where people complained about the remote control and how \"difficult\" it was.  As far as I am concerned the complaints are unfounded.  My 11 year old and I are the primary users of this television and we have never had any problem at all using the remote or any of the functions.The picture is great.  We use it connected to non-digital cable and also have a regular antenna to get the local HD channels.  The picture from both are A-plus.  We are Carolina Tarheel fans and the games have never been as fun to watch as they are now on the 46\" screen with the clarity this TV provides.  Another issue that was mentioned in a couple of the reviews I read before my purchase was the glare off of the glossy screen.  Again, we have not experienced this.  The room where our television is mounted gets a lot of afternoon sun through a 10' bay window directly into the screen, and there is little to no glare from the screen that impairs your ability to enjoy the television.I was worried that the red Touch of Color would be something my wife would frown on but, she did not even catch it until I pointed it out to her.As of now, I would buy this again (especially if I could get it at the price that I waited for it to drop to).

I went with this model because of the \"future features\" like the DLNA and network jack, but also because of the specs of this particular panel.  A lot of people will tell you to just go with the 650 over the 750 because they are virtually the same, but they are not!  The 750 actually has a better panel than the 650, according to some sites, and a better processor for that panel.  If you need to find specs, go to the AVS forums and look them up by model.The TV looked good right out of the box, but after some tweaking, it really looks fantastic!  I used some calibration settings from AVS forums and WOW!  Colors look rich and natural, not over-saturated and bright.  Black levels on this tv are excellent (the 52 inch model is rated excellent by Consumer Reports) and the sound really isn't bad for TV speakers.  The woofers built in make a difference in depth when you are listening.Now, I have noticed the \"halo effect\" when all the lights are off and we are watching a movie with lots of bright backgrounds and such, but other than that, I never notice it.  It isn't significant enough for me to make it a deal breaker.  Some people also complain about the screen being too reflective.  The screen actually is somewhere between a matte screen and a glossy.  You will notice reflections if you have light behind you or a window behind you, but in my home, the only light we have is an overhead...all lamps are to the side, and are not visible when watching.  So, the reflection doesn't bother me at all...it is quite minimal in my opinion.  In fact, the screen actually provides extra black and color depth that I don't see on other people's HDTVs.

I was initially looking at the Samsung HDTVs, and changed my mind a few times between several different models.After reading reviews I had my decision down to two models, this one and the Panasonic Viera with the THX certification.  I read the differences between the 650 and 750 samsung and I really liked the look of the 750 better plus the features of the \"better\" audio with included woofer so when the 750 prices dropped lower than the 650, I jumped on it, and I have not been disappointed for one second.This tv is incredible.  The \"halo\" effect that you hear about is there slightly, but it is not a problem at all, I barely notice it and probably would notice it a lot less if I hadn't read about it so much in the forums.The upgraded audio of the tv is really nothing special. The simulated surround sound does work well, but I had a projection tv prior that had great audio so that maybe why I don't have high grades for the audio on this tv, its good but does not stand out in my opinion.Overall, this television is just stunning.  I've had it about a month now and I still have a grin when watching it, its just amazing, the picture quality is second to none at the moment.  The AMP settings are great and I really couldn't ask for anything more with a TV.

Right out of the box, the picture is jaw dropping amazing. Since my purchase four weeks ago, I still haven't found the need to tweak any of the adjustments. The generic HDMI cable I bought through Amazon for a couple of dollars works great, and the sound quality far exceeds that produced using component cables. I connected a dvd recorder/player-vcr combo and 2.1 surround system and am thoroughly pleased. Since both are also made by Samsung, many of their remote control functions are integrated with those of the television's remote control. In short, I'm like a kid in a candy store.

However, I rounded up to 5 because the flaws are minor ones in my opinion and do not warrant a full point deduction.This is our first HDTV and the picture is amazing.  The colors are crisp and the blacks look superb.  I was concerned about glare at first because we have a lot of ambient light (from windows, doorways and a half wall) in our living room, but it has not been a problem.  The connections are plentiful even though I could use a couple more legacy connections while I'm building up funds to upgrade my other equipment.  My old progressive scan DVD player only outputs 480p and this TV upscales the picture beautifully.  The Xbox 360 looks great on it and hopefully I'll get to see some Blu-ray content on it in the future.  It works really well as a second monitor for the Laptop - digital pictures look great at 46 inches.  Over the air DTV looks great too.  The sound quality is pretty good.  We only turn on the surround sound receiver for movies because the speakers are more than adequate for average daily use.  The TOC feature is very subtle and doesn't detract from the viewing pleasure.  I have yet to experience the \"halo effect\" on my set that many have commented on.  It has taken a bit for me to get used to the short warm-up time for LCDs.  Coming from a CRT with practically no warm-up time it seems longer than it really is.  The Auto Motion Plus (AMP) feature is hit or miss.  I'm not sure if I'll get used to it or not.  With DVDs and the AMP on high, the picture looks over-processed to me.  My wife's description was the most accurate, \"it reminds me of a BBC documentary.\"I was originally looking at the 650, but when I was about ready to purchase Amazon had the 750 listed for 80 dollars less than the 650.  It seemed like a no-brainer to me when combined with the other offers/rebates at the time (late Jan 2009).  The delivery was quicker than stated and it was nice having someone unbox it and put it on the TV stand for me.  I also was able to go down the delivery check list before signing off on it (does it work, is there physical damage, do you get a picture on screen, etc).  No matter what anyone says, the white glove delivery is worth it (maybe not at full price, but definitely when free) because you can easily see defects and refuse delivery on the item.  Regular delivery only really allows for visible box damage, not defective products.  I am more than satisfied with my purchasing experience.My real complaints are minor because they don't affect my every day use.  First of all, the internal storage is a great concept, but I misunderstood its purpose when reading the specs.  I thought I would be able to access and utilize this space, but that is not the case.  The internal storage only stores content from Samsung and so far I've been unable to figure out how to add content to it (even Samsung's additional content for download).  Additional content must be loaded on a flash drive and accessed via the Wiselink port.  It just seems kind of gimmicky and I think it could have been implemented so much better.  Imagine having a 46\" digital picture frame for parties, etc.  My second complaint is the PIP feature.  It is not a fully developed feature, as others have bemoaned.  However, one annoyance for me in particular is that I can't even use it to view two broadcast channels using a digital converter box through the AV input.  The only inputs that allow PIP are component, HDMI and PC.  The limited functionality and difficulty involved in finding the PIP options in the menu baffle me.  I had PIP on my previous CRT television and rarely used it, but it was fully developed and easy to use.  I would be more inclined to use it on this set with the side-by-side feature if it were easier to use and fully functional.  For this kind of money I would have expected a better PIP implementation.  I can only hope that Samsung will correct some of this with a firmware update because some of the features have outstanding potential.Overall this is a great TV for the money.  The only thing that could make the 750 significantly better is LED backlighting.  That is available on the 950 for about twice the price of this set.  It is rumored the 2009 version will include the LED backlighting, but then it will likely be close to twice what I paid for this set too once it is released.  If you can get a good buy on the 2008 version of the 750 it is well worth it.", "Date": "February 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "great purchase!", "Author": "Jeannette Padro \"WJPadro\"", "ReviewID": "R3NBNVKHQQ7016", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We shopped around for about 2 weeks and never thought we would find such a good tv online..I usually don't purchase these kind of items online but I couldn't find a better bargain and from now on I know I can.. from Amazon!

The retail price had come down to $2,099 for the 650 and $2,299 for the 750.  The 750 had a couple of additional features over the 650 but not enough to make up the $200 difference.  In late January I discovered that Amazon had reduced the price to $1,515 and $1,530 for the 650 and 750 respectively.  For $15 difference I went with the 750.  Amazon sent it via their White Glove shipper; I think it was CEVA.  I had not a single problem with them.  When the TV arrived in Charleston, SC, they e-mailed me.  I called them the next day to work out the delivery details.  The set was delivered to the inside of the house, uncrated, placed on my stand and then I was shown the basics of how to use it.

It is unlike any other that I have seen.  We did a lot of comparing with other tv's in the stores.  We were dead set on the Samsung tv but man does it cost a lot of money.  We did some shopping on the internet and found Amazon to be approximately 700.00$ less than what we would have paid in the store.  We ordered it, also got free shipping and had the tv in about 5 days.  It was totally painless.  After we got the tv, I set it up and hooked up the High Definition satelite and turned it on.  WOW!! What a picture!!  I am still amazed that the picture quality is that precise.  All the controls are fairly simple and straight forward to use.  The fact that it has 4 HDMI inputs is a huge plus to me.  I use my HD satelite, Hd blue ray DVD player, and my HD XBOX 360 in the HDMI inputs and still have one left over for whatever else I might need.  The tv aslo has two seperate component inputs for other things that are not high def.  I watch a lot of sports and the 120 MHZ is amazing.  This is one of the things that was a priority for me.  There is practically no blur rate when watching this tv. The contrast ratio is amazing.  The color black on this tv is actually black, not like other tvs that are not very dark.  When the tv is on a totally black screen you really can't tell if the tv is on or off.  Truly amazing product...hey it's a Samsung.  What do you expect.The 'halo affect' that you hear eveyone talk about is not that big of a deal for me.  I can see some 'haloing' at night in a dark room but for me its not that distracting.  The way that front piece is designed on the tv is what causes the affect.  I guess if I had to find a downside, this would be it, however I want to say again that it does not bother me and I would purchase this tv again if I had to.  It is a great tv and I would recommend this tv for eveyone that truly enjoys watching tv at its finest.", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung's A750 Outstanding Performance", "Author": "Samuel H.

Not much glare when windows are to the side, minimal reflection when set up right.  \"Halo effect\" at night is minimal.  It seems those who complain about this are searching for a perfect TV that hasn't been made and are forgetting that their huge 32\" or whatever they had back in the 90s was horrible compared to this. Used a VESA wall mount that works perfectly using the 600 x 600 settings (TV is actually 600 x 400 but it works well).  Anylink+ works great with my Samsung 1500 Blu-ray, setting up InfoLink today using a Samsung WIS08BG2X Linkstick Wireless LAN adapter that has had great reviews.  Calibration settings found on [...] and then modified slightly.  TruSurround XT works great, but normal sound is great too.  120Hz is awesome on HD channels and Blu-rays.  Used component cables for Comcast cable, an HDMI for Blu-ray.The only problem I have had was with taking the stand off.  The four screws in the back are hard to maneuver out of the holes, and the weight of the TV on the stand kept them from unscrewing correctly.  Suggest having someone hold the TV up a little while you unscrew, or put a lot of pressure when unscrewing.  Eventually got them out.  Overall, great TV, no power problems crossing my fingers.

It didn't bother me as much as other reviewers, but I did mention it to CADENCE. The great thing was she offered me a 10% credit on my purchase which was already a great price considering no tax, shipping charges, and less than the 650 model. That's $143 back in my wallet. It will go to the purchase of my Samsung blue-ray player. Another issue was with my remote. It had a loose piece of plastic rattling around inside which couldn't be removed from the battery bay. CADENCE is going to send me a Samsung link so I can get a replacement.

Best color black on any flat panel LCD TV I have seen! Ok sound. The 750 has a subwoofer that the 650 does not so claims Samsungs web site. The tv's EQ menue settings do help you adjust the sound to something acceptable but nothing is better than turning on the 7.1 audio system. The remote takes some getting used to but is ok and is not a universal remote. Infolink is a cool feature. News, weather and stock quotes at the push of a button. Auto motion plus 120HZ makes watching sporting events broadcasted in HD just amazing!!! The price from Amazon was a steal. $1461 back on Jan 12th with free shipping and no sales tax. Cheaper than the 650 on sale that day with a few more features!!! Fast shipping with Pilot and they unboxed the TV, set it on the stand and made sure it worked. This TV was in a Samsung box and due to the way it was packaged had to be new. THE ISSUE with substitute cheap lower quality Chinease panels in Samsung sets seams only related to the series 5 sets and lower. Every 650 and 750 I looked at had the Samsung panel in it. I did see 550 sets with the Chinease panels. You can check your TV by looking just behind the right side of the bezel. The last line that says \"version\" should start with an \"S\" for Samsung.THE BAD: The TOC. (Touch of Color Bezel) The only reason I can't give this wonderful set 5 stars!!! Though the bezel looks great it does cause problems depending on the TV's surroundings. When checking out and comparing the set at Best Buy in a low lit area things appear ok but the reflective face of the bezel reflects any light sourse in the area infront of the set. The TOC bezel also has another design flaw that reflects light from the screen itself to the outer 1/4\" edge of the bezel. A real noticable problem in a dark room. THE FIX: I went to the Samsung web site and had an online chat with a rep who in the end told me my TV needed service. I filled out the online service request and a local Samsung authorized tech called me within the hour to confirm the problem. He told me he would order a newly designed bezel from Samsung and come out to my home and change it out for free. Seems Samsung knows of the issue, has a newly designed bezel and will change out the Bezel for anyone who requests service within the warranty. The set was maufacuted in August 2008. The set arrived with firmware version 1009.1 so I updgraded to 1012.2 from the Samsung web site just to be up to date.

This has been by far the largest purchase that I've ever made on line, so I was quite hesitant and anxious about it. Everything turned out great, though. The price at Amazon was excellent (quite a deal, in fact), and the delivery service was fine. The set arrived a couple of days before the promised date, the company called to set up a time, and two people brought the set into my house, unpacked it and set it on the cabinet. They also made sure that the TV worked by turning it on. I have no complains at all, they were courteous and I got what I expected. I connected all the different cables and devices myself, it was easy and straightforward. I have HDTV service from Dish, and it's wonderful. The picture quality is excellent and the controls are easy to maneuver. I've been fiddling with color, contrast, brightness, etc. to get the picture that I like, and it hasn't been difficult. The sound quality is fine by me. There are several preset choices that would satisfy most people. The red edge around the screen doesn't bother me at all; on the contrary, I think it gives the TV a high-end finish and the result is quite beautiful. I recommend this TV without any qualms.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "WOW !", "Author": "James J.

I saw this TV four months ago for the first time and I loved it, but I was afraid because was a new product and no reviews available.The red Touch around is very cool, eventhough I can see it when the room is dark, I thought that when I'm watching a movie I could see the red frame, but nothing, I just can see it when the light came thru the window behind the TV, maybe I haven't activate something, is the same for you guys?, so then my question to those who said that the red touch was distracting, I don't see the point. It's exactly why I bought the TV, to have the cool red touch, and I chose this one over 650 series.It's hard to be objective with this TV, just because I really like it, and so far so good. Samsung did a great job, and i'm very happy with this purchase, totally worth it. If you haven't decided yet and still wondering if there is anything else out there better than this, you are just wasting time, just buy it, you won't regret it.I'm not very into technical stuff but after compare the futures with a few others TV, 750 Series is still my option. Now I have LN-T4071F in the room (awesome TV!!!) and the 32\" 550 series in the kid room, she went crazy with that one too.

Only one man came with the delivery truck, so I helped lift it off the truck and carry it into the house.  The truck driver would not help lift my old set out of the way because of his \"bad back.\"  So much for the \"white glove service.\"  A couple of days later my son was able to come over and help me exchange the units.  As a 71-year old retiree, I found moving the Samsung to be no problem when there was someone to help.  The other surprising aspect was that the next business day after ordering the set, I received an email from Amazon informing me that the price of the set was now $40 less than I had paid.  My efforts to be provided the reduced price were in vain.The two days I had to wait for installation of the new set permitted time to play with it using an antenna.  When installed, our cable service is available.  With either antenna or cable, the picture is just nothing less than fantastic.  Unfortunately, normal broadcasts look pretty poor after seeing images in HD.  We find few broadcast in 1080p.  Rarely programming will use 1080i, since most HD programming seems to be in 720p.The only real disappointment with the set it the strange way picture-in-picture, PIP, is handled.  One of the features that led me to select the Samsung was the promise of PIP, a feature I particularly appreciate in our old, analog TV.  The PIP feature is available only when a device is connected and active that does not require the V-Chip.  Turning off the V-Chip in SETUP is not sufficient to permit PIP.  Apparently, the feature must be deactivated through use of a device that does not have a tuner.  We have a Samsung combination VCR-DVD, each component of which is independently connected to the TV.  PIP is not possible while the VCR is active, but it is available when the DVD is connected through the S-Video input.  Even when using PIP, picture swap is not possible, so there is little about the PIP feature that has been designed to make it a useful addition to an otherwise great TV.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "On/Off Problem...", "Author": "Mrinal K.

We got the white glove service but I honestly couldnt wait for them to come and deliver it so I went and picked it up as soon as they told me the TV came in.  This TV is absolutely AMAZING.  I also got a PS3 to go with it and the blue ray movies look fantastic, the games look fantastic, and the HDTV stations look great, however I am disappointed with the amount of HD channels available and sometimes the quality of thier broadcasts suck.  I watched football and basketball on it so far and it is crazy how good the picture and the colors and blacks are.  I plan on hooking up surround sound soon but for now I have it hooked up in stereo and the sound is great as well.  The touch of red is not at all overwhelming and its hardly noticable but its nice to have.  120hz automotion is nice and you can adjust your picture a million ways.  I didnt have it calibrated and I messed around with the backlight some and I was more than happy with the picture.  Also, there are plenty of ports and a USB port on the side which is cool.  The TV comes pre-loaded with some content like recipes and stuff which is pretty much useless but there is a section with art where you can look at all of these pictures and landscapes and it shows you what kind of images the TV is capable of.  I was in awe at the quality. I read about how ugly the remote was and how its a pain to navigate.  I dont think its that ugly of a remote but I really could care less about that.  I also dont think its that much of a pain to navigate with once you are used to it and you know how to find what you are looking for.  Whats annoying is that you have to point the remote at the right side of the TV for it to work.  I also read about peoples concerns regarding the screen glare but I didnt have a problem at all and I think there is a decent amount of natural light in my living room.  Its an amazing TV and at $1450 it was a no brainer for me.  I highly recommend it.

Many if Samsung releases web updates for it, it may be of more use.  The infolink is really a nice feature, but it doesn't diplay all of your pictures or movies.

It doesn't work unless you have another device with a tuner althought I still haven't got it to work yet.

Very  few channels have this information.  My old CRT TV almost always had information for every channel and for days ahead as well.Overall, I am happy with it and love the picture quality of the digital stations, but the analog stations look worse than my old CRT TV.

It seems a simple solution to move the light source to the side of, or in front of the TV so that there is no light coming from behind it.  (Although, for those with living room arrangements that cause the window to be behind the TV, you may find yourself annoyed by \"halo\")The sound is good but not great, I am using my stereo system speakers to output the sound from Cable/DVD in a configuration much like having a receiver (the receiver is next on the purchase list).  I noticed that HDMI from either input source results in the sound output from the TV (HDMI interface) and the stereo (RCA cables) are not synced (the TV sound occurs a fraction of a second before output to RCA, resulting in an echo), so I am forced to mute the TV.  This will hopefully be resolved when I switch to a reciever (but it's not a huge loss if it doesn't, again, muted TV.)  This isn't the TVs fault, but the stereos fault, since the stereo does not support a digital interface (HDMI) for sound.The picture is beautiful.  It comes default with the LCD display set to full power always, but I tuned the TV and now when I'm looking at static pictures (or TIVO control panels) the TV reduces power consumption automatically.  The UI is not necessarily intuitive, but I didn't have any problems with it.Integration via Anynet+ with other Samsung products (BluRay DVD in my case) is fantastic, allowing you to use a single remote for all of your devices.  I have some non-Samsung products (like Tivo and Cable TV) so I'm still forced to get a universal remote (I did, and it works great).  As great as Anynet+ is, I won't be buying a Samsung receiver because I have non-Samsung products...  but if I could go all Samsung, Anynet+ is very attractive (saving over $100 on a remote is probably worth the few extra dollars per product to get that kind of integration.)", "Date": "November 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "All-around pleased", "Author": "Kristina Kisiel \"kzkisiel\"", "ReviewID": "R9Y60B0OCPOSK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reviewing dozens of websites and Consumer Reports, we decided to purchase this LCD tv.

The screen on the Sony still reflects, it is more muted, instead of a light reflection you get hazy light reflection, this in effect washes out the screen.2.  The Samsung has deeper and more accurate colors.  The Sony looks like its from a different generation.  True the Samsung reflects like glass... but the darker image makes this not matter.  only time you'll notice (when the screen is black and outside is bright).3.  The Sony 1080i looked much worse than the Samsung, the amount of detail does not compare.4.  Size.  The Sony is nice how small it is.

It is subtle, to be sure, but after awhile it was annoying.3)  My biggest complaint is with the beveled bezel.  While sitting on the couch (standard couch, I'm 6'5\" and the console is 23\" high; TV is 8 feet from me), I was constantly annoyed by a refraction into the frame bezel, particularly on top.  Basically, light is refracted thru the plastic bezel, most of which is nice and black, but when it hits the beveled clear edge, there is a one-half inch strip of annoying light that matches up with what is on the screen.  So, if a guy in a white shirt walks across a dark screen, you will see a white bar traveling across the bezeled edges of the frame, inches away from the actual image.  I had 4 friends come over, and while all saw it, it really only bothered half of us...so go figure.So, I opted for the plasma as noted above.  No annoying bezel refraction, and the image seemed much more natural and organic, resulting in less eye strain.  There was a pleasant depth to the images that the LCDs in the store lacked as well.  Hopefully I'll like it as much once it's in my house, but I decided I just couldn't live with the Samsung LCD.  If I was going to use it as a big computer monitor, I would have kept it, but for natural-looking movies and HD TV, I think plasma is the way to go.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE", "Author": "CHAD \"CHAD\"", "ReviewID": "RV159RBEZJIJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZON WAS GREAT, THE TV WAS SHIPPED QUICKLY AND UNDAMAGED.

Warranty only covers  the TV functionality.  I wonder they will say the same statement to their CEO!!  Btw the manager is manager of call center and she would not let me talk to her supervisor.I am very disappointed after putting my hard earn money into purchasing this TV.

No matter how carefully you try to protect the plastic or how gently you try to dust or clean it, it scratches. What's worse, the fine scratches pick up and reflect any lights in the room, causing harsh glaring patches of reflection around the TV.I called Samsung customer support twice about the problem and all they said was \"we don't warrant physical damage.\"It's a shame Samsung used such cheap, soft plastic for the bezel because this is otherwise a very good TV.
