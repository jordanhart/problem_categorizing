The picture is outstanding and surprisingly it also has fantastic sound (something I didn't expect to be impressed by). The best thing about it is the company you are buying. LG has the best customer service I have encountered of any electronics company. I had previously owned a Zenith that went dead on me. After some investigation I found they had gone bankrupt. I figured I was hosed but I later found out LG had purchased Zenith. After a few phone calls LG actually sent someone to my house to see if it could be repaired, free of charge. When they discovered it could not they replace it with this TV FREE OF CHARGE. They were in no way obligated to do this, they just did it. It wasn't even under Zenith's warrantee. The whole experience left me feeling that LG really cares about its reputation at an individual customer level. I will go out of my way to buy their products from here on. Great company!", "Date": "December 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very good value", "Author": "G. W. Petersburg", "ReviewID": "R24HI34MFDOHHI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hookup is simple, with a very good array of connection options.  Menu options are fairly intuitive.  Nice control for fine picture adjustments. I recommend using Video Essentials for picture adjustments, rather than the factory settings.  Image quality is excellent, but unfortunately the blacks are not quite as deep and rich as with the Pioneer Kuro, and some brief image persistance is noted in black scenes after a bright scene.  It would be nice if the system allowed seperate custom picture adjustment setting for each video source, but this is a minor issue.  Also, wish the remote was a universal learning remote.  Nevertheless, I am very satisfied with the quality of the picture, and feel this TV is a good value.", "Date": "March 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "LG 60PY3D review - preliminary", "Author": "YARS", "ReviewID": "R3VIJB5J37B4MD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Severe banding issues.
