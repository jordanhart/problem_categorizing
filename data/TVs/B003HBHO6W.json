So far its Great! Wow... Awesome pictures, really sharp colors and the sound is way better than most expensive LED T.V's. Whith 6 Primary colors, while most have 3 or 4, it also have 16 surround speakers!!!. I wasn't sure about Mitsubishi at first, because they are known better in cars, but I found out they have been making T.Vs for a very long time now and they are more popular in Asia. My T.V is always at work everyday, more than 8 hrs a day I'll say... not sure why it got bad reviews and didn't work with others. I will buy Mitsubishi again. It saved me almost a $700!!! I was really going for a Samsung or Sharp. Well, they are all Japanese company... Good thing I listened to the sales man in the store.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME PICTURE AND AWESOME  FEATURES", "Author": "M. A.

I added a powered sub and it replaced my 5.1 surround sound system. My wife loved the sound but hated all the extra speakers in the room so this TV fit the bill from the start. I would highly recommend this tv and the brand name.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money!!!", "Author": "biggie97", "ReviewID": "R3OMF7V7SJNI9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Unit failed after 2 months of very light use. I had the dreaded Mitsubishi blinking green power light issue. From what I have read this is a very common problem, I even had the unit plugged into a surge protector. They tell me that the internal power supply blew out. The Repair shop can not get the Main PCB that blew out in a timely manor so thankfully I am getting a store credit. I will go with my original plan and get a Samsung.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Edge-Lit LED Backlight\n16 Speaker Immersive Sound Technology - 32W Total System Power\nStreamTV Internet Media\n4 HDMI with CEC\nBluetooth A2DP Audio Streaming\nBuilt-in Wireless Internet,True120Hz\nEnergyStar 4.0 Qualified", "Name": "Mitsubishi LT-46164 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED Edge-Lit LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yXhUokfnL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003HBHO6W"}}
