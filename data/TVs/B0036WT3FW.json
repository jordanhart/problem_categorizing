I read the reviews and figured this set would meet my needs.  Got it all mounted and connected in the bedroom, but when I turned it on there was a vertical green line from top to bottom, right about left of center.  Very disappointing, right out of the box.  This one will definitely go back.  I plan on trying another, hoping this was just a fluke.Defect aside, the design is nice, picture quality good and volume is ok once you make adjustments to the equalizer under menu options.  The higher equalizer settings should probably have been set as defaults on this TV right out of the factory.  I noticed a couple reviews commenting on the poor volume, but changing the settings makes a big difference.I also considered a 26-inch set, but the 22-inch turned out to be just the right size for the bedroom.If this set didn't have the problem with the vertical line, I would have given it four or five stars.  I'll try a replacement and see what happens.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture!", "Author": "C.

Thornton \"Angelic Q\"", "ReviewID": "R3M9KA1F39M73E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV so I really can't compare it to other TV's. I just purchased this product about two weeks ago and I love it. I did lots of research for the size and if I wanted to go for a 120HZ instead of 60 HZ refresh rate. All the 120HZ were at a bigger size and I had a budget. I went with this one.Now I mostly use this HDTV for video gaming. I have an Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii. The Xbox 360 came with a HD Component plug but the PS3 didn't so I purchased a HDMI plug thinking it was a HD Component plug. Oh well. It worked fine with the tv. The TV has one HD component plug, a couple of USB ports, and one HDMI. My lack of research was in this area as I didn't think I needed more than one HDMI port. The HD cable box I had to get used an HDMI port therefore I would have to unplug/replug the PS3's HDMI whenever I want to play. Not too much of a hassle! lol.So out the box, I had a little trouble screwing the stand into the bottom of the HDTV. Perhaps it was my screwdriver, but it still took me more than an hour to screw the darn thing into it and it's not even that tight cause it wiggles around a little bit. They should have made the holes a little bigger I think.Setting up the HDTV to work with the many components was as smooth as butter. At the time I didn't have my cable box and only had my gaming systems so the option for the Air and Cable channels didn't work for me. To switch between components, all you do is press the source button on the remote and go to TV, Component, HDMI, and Media (for USB). My cable box was on HDMI and my Xbox 360 was on Component.The graphics look amazing. Again this is my first HDTV so I can't compare to others. I found that I could change the view size to that of widescreen or fullscreen (4:3 or 16:9 ratios). There were more options than that which is great! Also, there were cable channels in HD so that was even better! Game Mode isn't really a big deal. It comes on automatically when I play my games. It makes the screen a little darker at least that's all I can notice. And I turn it off when watching cable.I guess the only thing I can point out about the graphics is that when watching a movie in standard IT REALLY SHOWS its choppyness in the background especially with older movies. Not sure if there's an option to fix this. I could probably mess around with it.The sound of the HDTV is decent, and I guess because of the size and where you use the TV. I have a small room so it's prefect but if you're using it in let's say a master bedroom and you are playing a big action movie or so, you have to turn it up more than 70/100 to hear it well. There might be an adjust in the menu also for this, haven't played around with it much lol.As far as using it for pictures and music from a media player, I haven't used the HDTV for that yet. Once I do I'll edit this review. In the meantime, I think this HDTV is awesome for being my first one!Thanks for reading *(^^)*", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great value for the money", "Author": "Sonny", "ReviewID": "R35JXS8P3XC8BI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung flat screen was exactly what we needed for the kitchen area.

When viewed close to the TV, the colors are darkened and distorted.  This could be overcome by tilting the TV more downward but Samsung instructions limit the tilt to 15 degrees.

The picture is clear and bright. There is no distortion with fast moving images. It looks wonderful.The downsides? As said elsewhere, the volume isn't loud. It isn't quiet, but if you're looking for a theatre experience or need to drown out a room full of kids, you'll need amplification. The screen is plenty bright if the power-saving features are turned off. Once you add the power-saving, it's too dim for anything except a perfectly dark room.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for the Price", "Author": "M.

I bought it to place it by my work station so I can watch DVDs or play some xbox games after I finish doing illustrations. The volume is a -bit- quiet but since I am right beside it I don't notice unless I am out of the room. My only complaints are the buttons on the TV itself, and how the image gets a tad darker if you view the screen a little to the left or right. Like most new televisions you can't see the buttons on the TV screen and are forced to use the remote. I am one of the few people who like to use the buttons on the TV, especially when I got it set up so close beside me. But this is really a minor thing.

We originally bought a 46 inch for the living room and I recently bought the 22 inch for my craft room.  Finally got it hooked up today and I am very impressed with the HD.  My only complaint is that these HD TV's really need to come with the HD cable so you don't have to buy one after your purchase.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for that reason.  I would definitely recommend the Samsung flat screen.  The 22 inch is great for a small area like a craft room, although I wish I had purchased the 26 inch.

After installing it, we discovered that when using the TV connected to an HD receiver, it goes off at the proper time and comes on at the proper time,except that all you get is snow on the picture and need to use the TV remote to change the source back to HDMI/DVI.  When I contacted Samsung they said the on/off switch does not work with HDMI/DVI.  They make no apology and just say that is the way the set is designed.  Having said that, the picture is great in HD.  If you just want HDTV and don't care about the on/off switch, this is a fine set at a reasonable price.
