It has been moved and shifted around numerous times due to me being in the military.  The picture is great for 720p and my kids LOVE watching television and movies on it.  Don't let all of the bad press and reviews get to you, this is a good buy.  It's large but it's light and very easy to move.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worked for 13mo - Now broken, common problem", "Author": "S. K.
