The quality and color of the picture is excellent and the sound is very good considering the unit is not intended to be a home entertainment component piece but rather a stand-alone unit for a smaller room.  I bought the set for our kitchen, and it is an excellent addition.  The ability to watch DVD videos related to cooking, baking, and food preparation is a really nice touch.  Although I delayed buying the set because there seem to be so few positive ratings about it online, I decided to take the plunge anyway, and I am certainly glad I did because I have not found any of the more negative issues other reviewers have mentioned.  For the price of this set, I believe it to be an exceptional value, and I recommend it highly.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poorly Designed", "Author": "John A,.

Out of the box, it sits unlevel.  Apparently, the weight of the DVD player on the left side creates a slight tilt.  The tilt is annoying in the beginning, but you will adjust.I bought the TV in April of 2011.  Unfortunately, I did not try watching a DVD until September, after the return policy has expired.  The DVD player will not read any DVD I try.Toshiba has advised I need to send the TV in for repair, but they do not cover the shipping to their facility.  Shipping will cost more than another DVD player.  So much for warranty.I bought this TV because I have other Toshiba products that I like.  This TV has been a big disappointment.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Okay, but power supply is doomed", "Author": "castillet", "ReviewID": "R2S5OKO4J3HCFC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We had this TV for a little over a year. It was installed in the bedroom, so it got some use, but not too much. During that time, the picture quality was good as was the sound. No complaints. However, after about a year it started not turning on. I had it serviced and they told me the power supply was gone. Dead. They said it's pretty common in this Toshiba model and that Toshiba doesn't even make a replacement power supply.

I have found it to be exactly as advertised on Amazon, with no obvious defects or surprises. I have noticed none of the negative things stated in other reviews on this site.There are a couple of things I particularly like about this set. First, it has more than sufficient input and output capabilities, especially since you no longer need an external DVD player (note however, that the internal player is for DVD's only, not Blu-ray discs). Additionally, the on board speakers for this set are of quite good quality, and more than sufficient for a secondary TV. Assembly literally took me one minute (and the aid of only a screw driver), and the initial setup is as easy as following a few on screen prompts.On a personal note, I have learned over the years to take online reviews and ratings with a grain of salt. I've found that the majority of negative ratings come from either the buyers lack of technical knowledge, or the buyer not using the product for it's intended use. If your looking for a theater quality TV, with ear shattering audio, internet apps, and the ability to watch your entire home movie collection on 10 different kinds of discs, this is not the TV for you. If, on the other hand, your looking for a basic HDTV, with a functional on board DVD player to reduce clutter, and the ability to hook up your streaming device, TOSHIBA HAS PRODUCED A VIABLE CHOICE!!!Revised on 1-10-2012:After a little over a month of use, this TV went completely out today. Absolutely no warning, it just failed to even turn on. Other reviews mentioned a power supply issue, and I now believe them to be correct. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TV!!!! On a positive note, Amazon paid the shipping for me to return it, no questions asked. I'll be sticking to LG, which I've always had good luck with in the past.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible product - don't purchase this", "Author": "Chris Kunselman", "ReviewID": "REUPPP4C4HFQ4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "NOT ONLY IS THE PRODUCT TERRIBLE, SO IS TOSHIBA SUPPORT.

There is a power supply issue witht his product and mine failed too.  I am sending it in (at my cost, because that's toshiba's warranty) to be fixed at their cost.  I would not waste money on this product.  I'm stuck with it now.  DO NOT BUY IT!

So far it performs just like the other smaller version which is very well. Before I got the Comcast converter, I connected a small antenna so I could see what true high def. looks like from our local TV channel. Let me tell you that true over the air 1080i is the best you will get over cable or satellite. Unfortunately that was the only channel I picked up so we will be connected to Comcast's standard 480i picture which looks like crap but I refuse to pay the extra money Comcast charges for the better box. My son will be using it mostly to watch movies and play his Xbox anyway. I will agree that the set leans a bit to the left because of the weight but we mounted it to the wall as was planned so that is not an issue. I hope that we do not have any of the other issues that were reported in previous reviews. I would highly recommend this. Oh, as far as LCD/LED. All monitors are LCD (liquid crystal display). The \"LED\" is the back light used to give you a picture. The older TV's used fluorescent lighting but now they use LEDs for better picture and less energy consumption. Don't get confused as the other writer was.

The Boss picked it up at a local BB after the clerk recommended it for a PS3 ONT THE SAME DAY Amazon delivered a 22-inch Samsung I buought for her for the same purpose.I don't like this at all.  The viewing angles are the narrowest I've ever seen an LCD screen produce.  It seems that 10-degrees off of directly in front of the screen and the picture gets so dark you can't really see what's going on, and the drop off is worse if you are more than a couple of degrees above or below it.Yes, directly in front of it and it has a great picture, very crisp with good contrast and great color rendition.But if you squirm around or change positions a lot - like me - it disappoints.UPDATE:  Adding one star.  The narrow viewing angle is only a problem with on-air or satellite standard-definition content.  When playing DVD's or Blu-rays, viewing angle is less of a problem.  It's still too narrow, IMHO, but it's significantly better with HD than non-HD content.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "No instructions to remove pedestal/neck", "Author": "KarenH", "ReviewID": "R3QWVFVPZG3PXF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was completely frustrated with this tv and Toshiba.  We wanted to wall mount the tv, but could not remove the pedestal/neck.  I called Toshiba because there are no instructions to remove the neck and they were no help whatsoever.  I was told repeatedly to remove 4 screws from the bottom and then hung up on twice.  These are the instructions in the manual to remove the base of the stand or rectangular part, not the neck, the cylindrical thing that sticks out at the bottom of the tv.The third guy told me to call their service centre in our city.  I called them and they told me I would have to pay for a service technician to make a house call.  Why should I have to pay for a service call?  How can they advertise this tv as wall-mountable and not supply instructions as to how to get the neck off.One of the other reviewers on this site helped me out and wrote how to do it.  I can't tell you how much I appreciated his help.  It was a simple matter of removing 3 screws above the neck and pulling firmly on the neck.  Seems simple, but the neck is quite firmly held in the tv and you really have to tug.  Who knew?As far as the tv is concerned, the picture is okay, the sound is a bit tinny and can't be turned up enough and there is no headphone jack to add speakers, it's nice to have the dvd player, but you cannot hook up an external hard drive and watch stored shows.  It only displays photos - no video.  This is our first flatscreen and I am not too pleased with the choices of the picture ratio.  Either you can set it so that there is a border around or on either side of the whole picture or you can get the picture to fill the whole screen, but it is either cropped or stretched and distorted.  Not Toshiba's fault of course.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "lasted one week", "Author": "turkishcarpenter", "ReviewID": "RORND8EB5OXKI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "One week from purchase date, remote stop working.

I can't find any of the problems listed in other reviews.  I left this new on since I got it, nonstop.  I do cycle the power on/off a time or two a day.  I've played a dozen or so DVD movies.  Sound is as good as I would expect.  It IS certainly loud enough.  Usually the audio volume is between 7 and 12.  Maybe 15 if with a fan on in the room.  Some Netflix videos have gotten me up to the 40's. Out of 100.  TV is in a bedroom enviroment.  I personally found that a +6 boost in bass and a -4 cut in treble helped quite a bit IMHO.  However, I will say I think the speakers are on the right rear of the sceen.  I've used the tv on a stand in a corner of the room, and now wall mounted, with no volume issues and unit seems physically balanced.  No problem with tilting.  There is a 1 second or so delay when turning channels with the internal tuner with some, not all, channels.  Scanning through many channels does seem slow. Maybe TV signal dependant?  And for the few who might care, owners manual says it's Video CD (VCD) compatible.Though I was aware before purchase, I wish it had a headphone jack and analog audio out.  Digital optical out is available.  Also, wish it had Dolby Volume compression or equivelant for TV signals.  Dolby audio compression is available for DVD audio. 60hz has it's limitations, but very tolerable at this screen size.Highly recommended. Picture is great.  Sound is good.  Remote is better than some.Tuner is ATSC/NTSC/QAM (Digital/Analog/Cable-unscrambled). Included stand allows screen to tilt up/down.  Delivery was very fast.  EPA power rating of $7 year.  As long as the power supply and overall reliability holds up, Overall, I'm very pleased.  If it dies, I'll update this review.***Update 11-29-12  --All is still perfect.  Couldn't be more pleased.***Update 4-7-13.  Still going strong and used half of every day.

I hadn't even opened the box yet, and I was contemplating taking it back, but I'm very glad that I didn't!  I wall-mounted my set it the corner of my bedroom ceiling (in a 10' x 10' room).  It fits perfectly above the door and is the largest set that would fit in that space with a built-in dvd player.  I'm happy to report that I like everything about this set.  The sound is way more than adequate (I sometimes have to turn it down to 2 or 1 just to keep it from being too loud during some shows), so this set is plenty loud and the volume can be cranked way up.The viewing angles on this set are also just fine.  I am viewing the screen from below, at an angle, and the image is still bright and clear and not washed out.  The DVD player also works fine, it even reads discs that wouldn't play in my previous dvd player and that I was about to toss out (glad I kept them)!  It has memory play, so it resumes where I left off, even after turning the power off.  I haven't had any dvd's that wouldn't read properly so far!The only thing I didn't like about this set at first was that it didn't keep the \"full-screen\" aspect ratio that I like to view most programs in.  However, I learned that you just need to go into the setup menu, and under the \"theater\" setting, there's the option to turn off \"auto-format\".  For some reason, Toshiba ships this set with \"auto format\" on, when turning it off makes the picture retain the \"full screen\" aspect ratio.This is the second lcd tv/dvd combo unit I've owned (the previous was a 20\" Insignia set).  I like the Toshiba much better, 4\" larger screen that fits in the same space above my doorway, much better dvd player, and a brighter, clearer picture.  If you have any doubts, buy this set from a reputable seller (like Amazon or Best Buy) that offers a return policy, but I highly doubt you'll be taking this Toshiba back if you try it!", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quit working after 5 months", "Author": "S.

But it didn't matter which way I put in any DVD, it would say \"reading\" for about 15 seconds and then spit the DVD back out.  I called customer service who told me to unplug it & try again, which made absolutely no difference.  If so many don't work out of the box, I can't imagine how they would hold up a few years down the road.  I have had 3 Toshiba TV/DVD/VCR combos in the past, and I really liked them.  I still have 2, and after several years (at least 6--I honestly can't remember!), the DVD players are now becoming temperamental.  But I have purchased my last Toshiba anything.  I don't know why I thought I would be lucky, but it was such a great price, I couldn't resist.  I'll know better next time.

In the wall, ran an 25ft, 24awg HDMI cable to tv set from HDMI HD cable box input. The cable came from cmple/ny amazon for $8. Placed in wall speakers each side of closet doors. Ran an optical cable from tv to amp inside closet, amp sits on upper rack. Installed four electrical outlets inside closet, ran all the wires through one inch pvc pipe. Placed small 8 inch subwoofer inside, running LFE cable to amp, through pvc pipe. Inverted the csi/speco 6.5 speakers so the tweeter is angled down towards the listener.  Speakercraft aim7 three rotates the whole unit, expensive.  Used 50ft 12awg oxygen free copper wire, from ebay $18, Hopefully this dosent sound like a fire hazard, sounds great.
