{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing color and viewing angle", "Author": "Lily", "ReviewID": "RO8EOV8WSNC0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We didn't buy on Amazon, but wanted to share our review where it would be most useful.We initially chose this Seiki LCD because it had the best color and side-viewing angle of all the 32-inch TVs at Kmart. (The others were all LED.) Afterwards I did a bit of belated research and discovered that reviewers unanimously prefer LED (the newer technology). Took a gander at Costco a few days later and saw some Samsung LEDs that seemed astonishingly clear. So I got one, planning to take the Seiki back. But...when we set them up side by side, the Seiki won hands down. The Samsung was perhaps a tiny bit sharper, but in a harsh, unpleasant way. I tweaked every possible setting and could not get the rich, nuanced colors (especially golds and lavenders) or naturalness of the Seiki. And the side-viewing angle didn't even come close.We've only had it a couple of weeks, so can't yet comment on reliability. But if it breaks down after the one-year warranty, we'll try our best to find another Seiki LCD.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Seiki 32\" LCD 720p 60Hz HDTV | SC32HT04", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41x0xSTsGSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DLJEUKI"}}
