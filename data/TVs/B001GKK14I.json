I'm impressed.The Wizard setup is a piece-of-cake ,,, Just click OK. The Menus are navigable and comprehensible i.e. If confused choose \"standard\".The high quality REMOTE, which is stable when standing upright, feels comfortable in my hand, has a nice weight, a soft felt back and easy to reach and comprehend buttons. Remote response time is immediate [after initial channel download]. The angle of Remote Control to TV reception is near 90 degrees; if you can see the screen ,,, so can the remote :-)The SOUND quality is MOST excellent. Not tinny or muffled !!! I have it set at 30, out of 100, and I can easily hear and understand as I walk throughout my home. A marked difference from other TV's I've owned where the audio becomes garbled, muffled and I can't understand at any volume.The CONNECTORS are of ALL TYPES and are mounted on both the back and the side. They are clearly labeled for their function ,,, and correspond to the Remote Control buttons.I just took delivery of my Vizio today. Before purchase I read criticisms on another website ,,, those criticisms ARE BOGUS in my view. This product is MOST EXCELLENT !!! In every way !!! Maybe all of the criticisms have been addressed by VISIO ??? This Model has been out since at least 2006, sale price at that time $1,000.00.The setup took me 5 minutes out-of-the-box !!! --Oh yeah ,,, there's another nice feature, a built-in remote mounted on the side for those who can't keep track of that \"mobile\" remote control :-)", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "I love this TV", "Author": "E. Paulson", "ReviewID": "RY2JDUBAWLP7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided that it was finally time to do something about the 15-year old 19\" CRT I've been using in the bedroom, and I spent weeks looking at every 32\" LCD TV sold in the area (many trips to Best Buy, Sears, Target, Walmart, anywhere that carried TVs). I thought I had convinced myself that the Sony XBR6 or XBR9 was the right choice. However, last week Target had these on sale for $519, and I had another 10% off anything, so the final price was about $470 - 400 less than the Sony. The display Vizio looked decent, and I decided to take a chance. I could not be happier that I did.The picture looks great. I thought that the refresh rate would be too slow and I'd be annoyed at motion artifacts, but on my test sequences I haven't noticed a thing. In fact, I've moved the Blu Ray player to be attached to this TV instead of my Philips CRT HDTV because the picture is considerably better - the text on the PS3 is finally actually readable.I have no idea what the heck the \"Java\" in the name means, but it's not any sort of annoying software running on the TV getting in the way of just watching TV.If I had one complaint, it's that analog cable looks terrible on this TV. Maybe I just didn't figure out the right settings for it and it would work fine, but in the end it didn't really matter - I needed a second HD set top box from my cable company for $5 a month to get the HD lineup anyway, and through box the SD channels look pretty good. As a bonus, this TV switches between HD and SD very fast, unlike my other HDTV.Finally, I think this is about as close to an \"American\" TV as you can actually buy, though it's OEMed in Taiwan.  For this price, I don't think you can go wrong. Maybe I would have liked the Sony a bit better, but I'm happier that I saved the $400 and have a TV I really like.", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Vizio Ranked Above a  Sony Bravia by Consumer Reports, I agree", "Author": "DC Maxx \"Wood\"", "ReviewID": "RU5112AWWFQ81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this TV to replace  my old 35\" Sony 2 Tuner (analog) PIP set that was 11 years old that died last weekend with a 'pop'. High Voltage transformer blw & TV shop said it wasn't worth repairing since I had analog tuners in it. Plus it was a beast sized TV, all 200 lbs of it.  I had researched TV's online and pretty much convinced myself that getting a SONY 32XBR9 or getting a Sony Bravia L series 32\"  would be my best move.  Until I wondered into a [...] store in the mall. I had seen the display at Best Buy but those TV's are all mounted on the wall. However the  [...] display had them all lined up so you could touch them & operate the Volume controls at  viewing level.One thing I found out was, the Vizio picture was equal to ANYONE's picture. Despite what Sony had in the past, this TV is equally as capable with a High Definition signal or a Standard Definition signal (like from DBS satellite)I must admit I am normally biased to Sony, but Sony doesn't have a thing on this TV except Sony does make a better remote.  Thats the only complaint I have about the TV ... the remote is bland, not lit  and very lightweight. But since I do have SD Directv Satellite.  I have already purchased a lighted remote for the Satellite & my Satellite Remote will work this Vizio, so  I am good to go.The Vizio ran me 499 but it is ONSale for [...] members  right now until 9/30/09 in the store <50> off. The projected cost  for the Sony Bravia of the same specs is 649. and the cost of a Sony XBR9  32\" was to be 999 at Best Buy. I bought the Vizio after checking the ON screen menu which is in a very readable orange color; the volume levels  of the TV were checked too (the Vizio is louder then the Sharp 32\" or a Panasonic 32\" , volume seems the same as the Sony models) I must say that the thing that impressed me somewhat and made me take a second look at the Vizio is that Consumer Reports October 2009 issue had a LAB TEST where they rated the Vizio 32\" the best .  Seeing is believing!!  I must agree the rear hookups connection capabilities, Vizio even has a jack for headphones, the Sony models do not. But the Sony models all have significantly higher prices... Sony.. you cant rest on your past laurels; you got to show me where  its worth the extra money... times are tight.Regarding Motionflow technology... That's something you can't see unless you have a TV  screen that is 40\" or above.. so it wasn't a factor for a 32\"  TV. Vizio doesn't mention whether it is 60Hz or what speed it is. But I couldn't notice any blurring in its picture even when viewing a tennis match.Got to agree with Consumer Reports, this is the best Value for the money.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent HDTV at a price that's easy on the budget", "Author": "terpfan1980 \"Barry\"", "ReviewID": "R2HKPRSPO34TYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Vizio has advertised for a while now (ESPN Radio and other places) that they make top quality HDTV equipment at affordable prices and they are not kidding or just boasting in making those claims.When I originally jumped into the HDTV world I did so on a budget.  Having committed a considerable portion of my entertainment budget to get an Xbox 360 back when those boxes were being introduced to the market, I didn't have a lot of money to spend buying a large HDTV to play my games on.  Given the budget constraints and also some space constraints, I settled on a 26\" CRT, yes, that's right, I said CRT, widescreen HDTV that I got from a big box store that some folks would say fairly well resembles the Buy More stores shown on the excellent TV series Chuck each week ;-)  I knew it wasn't the best TV and knew that I'd want to replace it later, but it was HD, it was widescreen, and it easily blew away the picture quality of the old 27\" 4:3 standard TV that it replaced.A couple of years and tax refunds later it was time to revisit the HDTV I played my games on, and I started shopping around to see what I might be able to attain at the price that I wanted to aim for.  I found a couple of Vizio models in my price range, including a few that might, just might, be in stock at one of the big retail stores in my area.  Unfortunately there was no guarantee that the models that I saw online were going to be in stock in the brick and mortar stores, so I continued researching things on the web until I found the Vizio VO32LF HDTV at Amazon partner TigerDirect.com.  Yes, I know that's not exactly the same model as the one listed where I'm entering this review (the VOJ320F1A), but it is, for all intents and purposes, the same model TV with a different colored bezel (face) around the front of the TV's screen.  As it turns out Vizio has a couple of 32\" models and a couple of 37\" model TVs that are basically the same TV but each with a slightly different model number that denotes a different bezel or other relatively cosmetic difference between them.The VO32LF TV that I purchased was one that TigerDirect offered as a refurbished unit.  The price was outstanding, though the refurbished label did raise my concern a little.  Why exactly was the unit refurbished and/or recertified?  There could be several reasons, and a buyer is never going to know for certain what the real story is.  What the buyer does know is that the manufacturer has made the unit available via a retailer with the refurbished/recertified notation and the manufacturer is still guaranteeing the unit for a reasonable period of time upon purchase.Given the price and feature set, I thought over the potential purchase, researched other comparable models only to find that there were few, if any, that even came close to being as fully featured in the same price ranges, and decided that one of these TVs was going to be mine.  Order placed, and sure enough, approx. 5 days later the TV was in my hands.Knowing the unit that I got was a refurbished/recertified unit, I was somewhat eager to open the box and see if I could determine why the unit might have been sold that way.  Quite honestly, unless the problem was a very minor scuff like mark on the bezel that may very well just be a shadow/reflection from the lamp light in my 'den' area, I couldn't tell you what the issue was.  The only thing I did find out of the ordinary was that the unit didn't come with a power cord.  It was supposed to have, but I didn't find one in the box.  No problem though as the TV uses a standard computer or computer monitor power cord and I tend to have spares of those on hand.Once set up, I was and remain quite pleased with my purchase.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound (volume range) is quite sufficient for my video gaming, movie and TV watching needs.  Having 3 HDMI ports available means not having to juggle connections or settle for a component connection when I'd rather use HDMI.  There's also the full 1080p resolution, which even on the 32\" screen size (which is not really supposed to be noticable at that size) offers the best resolution possible for video gaming or Blu-ray disc play back.Having bought one of these great TVs, I look forward to buying at least one more in a much larger size in the future.  Eventually my living room will sport something in the 42\"+ size, and I expect Vizio's offerings will be highly considered.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pick another brand", "Author": "RJ", "ReviewID": "R1V0ZCEO6NCT4A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have this tv.

But, given all that, the picture quality is far superior to all the other televisions in this house.  It's sharp, clear, and steady as a rock.  Want to know what I like best about it?  It's a 32\" TV and it ONLY WEIGHS 35 LBS.  I almost got a double hernia moving the old 27\" TV out of the way, but I one-handed this baby right onto the stand.Hook up was a cinch because Vizio (the ONLY U.S. made television) includes a quick set-up guide, and an excellent instruction manual.  Okay, I did have to make one quick trip to Radio Shack to buy a cable I didn't have, but I was forewarned about that, so I don't count it as a negative.  Lots of hook-up options, so no matter how or what you want to hook up to this set, there's a hook up available for it (provided you have the right cable).Programming my TiVo remote to control the TV was a cinch since Vizio only has one code.  How's that for simplicity?This LCD HiDef true 1080P television set is excellent at any price, but how can you go wrong for $550 - 580?  Oh, and it looks good, too.

Especially Target & Sears.  I purchased mine at a standard sale before Christmas at Sears for $399.00, which is an excellent value.  This model's screen measures 31.5\", and with proper HDMI connections, is a TRUE 1080p set.  The vast majority of sets at this price display at 720p or lower, and the ONLY way they can advertise they display true HD is with a pure HD signal coming in. Those sets still only  display NEAR 1080p, with a direct signal of such. This is basically impossible with cable & satellite.  A good Blue Ray DVD player can achieve this.  This set is a cinch to setup, the TV does it on it's own.  Picture quality with cable is okay, but not outstanding.  Connecting with HDMI cables improves the signal a great deal. This Vizio set does not have enough choices during setup to adjust the picture to my personal liking.  There is no choice for \"Sharpness\" or Contour Shaping and the like.  If you're getting a poor cable signal, you're pretty much stuck with a fuzzy picture.  The sound has several different genre's (Rock, Jazz, Classical, etc) to choose to hear through the front firing speakers, but these selections don't make a major difference regardless of what you choose.  There are no choices to adjust Bass & Treble.  Sound is bright, clear & capable of being set loud, but a bit brash & sharp sounding with minimal bass.

We actually targeted the VO32E as a Consumer Reports Best Buy ... as usual, we could not find any and I'm sorry to say that on-line pricing is not competitive among most models.  We chose this one locally with a $30 2-year add-on warranty that actually starts AFTER the manufacturer warranty expires.  Ready? ... Walmart.Setup - it's a breeze with an 'initialization' screen that welcomes one with first turn-on, starting with an auto channel search routine for those using cable/over-the-air.  Since we're rigged with AT&T; U-verse (a nice service), I can't speak to over-the-air reception and dumped cable after years of abuse by that outfit.  It has all the setups needed for color density, contrast, yada accessed by a very intuitive remote control.  The only confusion was how to 'save' an entry (hint - the 'LAST' button is the answer).  It was not necessary to review the guide ... gee, that would ruin the challenge.Picture Quality - 1080P is quite good and better than an on-display Sony Bravia of the same price.  720P is satisfying and, in either case, viewing angle very good.  This set HAS the ability to automatically stretch 720 to full screen, but it's not a perfect process; it can get lost after running through setup options for reasons unknown.  It does a nice job of correctly sizing old 4:3 format video under 720 and 1080P.  Aspect ratio is an on-going challenge with our 37-in Toshiba, which can't seem to figure out what kind of signal it is getting.Sound - it's VERY well balanced in tone and clarity. typically lacking low bass.  When we added a mini component stereo system fed by the set's 'autio output' jacks to enhance the 'missing' bass it blended beautifully with the set speakers, which can be set to 'off' as desired.  Further, the set's audio output feed can be set as 'fixed level' or to track up and down with set speaker/ volume level; very thoughtful feature.Inputs - 3 HDMI, 2 Audio/Visual (L-R-Video), and 2 three color component inputs.  Outputs - There is one L-R RCA jacks analog output along with an RCA jack digital audio output.  All inputs can be programmed with a friendly name.I rate this set as a 'best buy' in its class, outshining the Sony Bravia version sitting by its side.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "VIZIO 32\"1080 LCD HDTV - JAVA (VOJ320F1A)", "Author": "Serious Shopper \"Joy\"", "ReviewID": "R3IT0PODBS596C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shopping in stores, on-line, and comparing prices, features, etc. for a 32\" LCD HDTV, I was fortunate to be able to compare the visual quality, sound, of the TVs.  I would set the controls to the same menu settings, for picture, sound, etc. and then look and listen.  By Far this TV out ranked, Samsung, Phillips.  The clarity of the picutre, and sound was much better,  The remote menu was so simple to use (and I usually have to read instructions), but not this one.  The one major feature of the VIZIO TV'S that sold me, was the speakers are on the FRONT of the TV facing out.  All others, had the speakers, on the side, majority were on the back or bottom facing down.  If you wall mount, or put a TV in a entertainment center, or cabinet and the speakers are on the back or sides, or bottom facing down, the sound bounces off the wall, or walls of the cabinet, which decreases the sound quality and if the sound quality is not so great then mounting or putting the TV close to a wall, or in a cabinet, decreases the sound qaulity even more.  VIZIO, also make a home theather package specific for the product, only two parts to the package.  Not only did VIZIO outrank in quality features, simplicity of remote, but also in price.  Also has 120hz, compared to others with only 60hz. and has 3 HDMI vs 2 HDMI.  I am also going to purchase the 24\" VIZIO 1080p NOT 720 but 1080p Most HDTVs under 32\" are only 720. The smaller the size, then 720 does not make much difference, but a 24\" with 1080p hard to find.  I'm a shopper, and compare prices, features and quality before making a decision.  I believe I made a good decision going with the VIZIO. At first I was looking at the Samsung, but when comparing side by side, Vizio took 1st place.

Last year - my 1986 Sony 25\" Trinitron (tube) XBR finally went up in a puff of smoke (literally). After some research on brand, picture quality of 1080 32\" LCDs, etc., I found this product on the internet to replace my old Sony and had it shipped - not before I went out of town on an extended contract assignment. When I returned - we decided to downsize our house, moved and FINALLY 10 months after purchase - we set it up.Using COMCAST in California (We're happy with our TV, Internet and phone service) we installed it in our master bedroom in a matter of minutes and couldn't be happier. Even at 32\" the 1080 resolution is noticable - giving greater detail than 720s I've seen. The colors are rich and the screen is indeed bright with all pixels working right out of the box. I've yet to unpack my bedroom home theater system - the speakers on the TV are ADEQUATE - sound quality being subjective to each of us - we haven't had an opportunity to play music at any great length - yet. For television - the sound is clear but has the expected lack of 'vibrancy' that most frame mounted TV speakers have.I simply mounted the VIZIO on my dresser, the screen brighteness easily comes through even the brightest sun when our blinds or shades aren't drawn - set it up using the HDMI cable from my HD cable box and couldn't be happier. My biggest concern was the delay in setting it up immediately after purchase - and NOT being able to return it if there were problems ... but, luckily the set is perfect and we couldn't be happier.I'll have a 2nd remote to deal with when the home theater system is found and installed).Played Blue-Ray movies from my computer with an HDMI hookup (it has 3) and plan to bring my Sony PS3 upstairs from a JVC 56\" HD DLP where it currently has a home.Very satisfied with the price, quality of picture and ease of setup - literally no adjustments out of the box.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "The WOW!

The savings was substantial and I knew going into the purchase the picture quality would be good but the sound quality would be tinny.  There is not much you can do about the sound based on the dimensions of the t.v. and the size of the speakers.  Accept it before you buy it and you won't be disappointed.  I run the audio through my BOSE and shut off the t.v. speakers so it sounds great for me! I had planned on doing this all along.  The picture quality is perfect for what I needed.  The t.v. is in my bedroom which is a small 10 x 10 size so a 32 inch works great for me.  I recommend my seller and this Vizio to anyone looking to not spend top dollar but still get a quality t.v.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "love vizio!", "Author": "M.

Olson", "ReviewID": "R2IIGWPSRVDWV9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a new external monitor for doing CAD work, and based on the dimensions of my office I decided a 32\" 1080P LCD display would be optimal.  I spent about 3 weeks reading on-line reviews, tech specs, and going to brick & mortar places to actually see some of the sets.  Let me say right now that in Vegas at least, most of the stores I saw spent zero time trying to make their TV displays appealing or to get a good picture.  Many didn't have the remote either.  I found the store visits to be most unhelpful.  stores I visted were [...], [...], RC Willey (a furniture store!!!) and Frys.hands down, the samsung 7 series absolutely blows my mind with the picture quality.  They are very expensive though, so I kept looking.  I'd never heard of Vizio before this search, but I come to find that they are assembled in the good ol' USA, got universally good reviews, have decent tech support, and sounded like I'd get a good deal.another important thing for me was warranty.  sometimes a good deal pricewise isn't such a good deal if a lot of people have had problems with it.  At first I was torn between a large LCD monitor and a 1080P tv; however I was shocked to find that there was only a very few monitors larger than 24\", and of those most were in the [...]+ range, with the Apple 30\" Cinema display a whopping $[...] bucks (about what I paid for my current MacBook Pro).  UG!there is a Hanspree 28\" monitor that has more than 1200 reviews here on Amazon.  great price, until I started looking into warranty.  EEEK!  let's see:  I can return it if there are 8 or more dead / stuck pixels..........I can't imagine how furious I'd be if I had a nice new monitor and had to live with as many as 7 bright dots (or blank spaces).  This monitor was [...] bucks, reasonable in my opinion.  the next least expensive monitor of similar size was [...] bucks.  I balked.the very lowest price 1080p tv's were no-name brands I'd never heard of in big box stores.  the only warranty was the store 90 day warranty and after that I'd be on my own dealing with a company no one's ever heard of before.  No Thanks.I'd just about steeled myself to pay 550 to 650 for my display, when Dell came up with this VOJ320F (one of the contenders) for [...].  I called their customer service dept to ask about return policy and etc; it bothered me that none of the questions I was asking were answered on their website, but the verbal answers I did receive were exactly what I was hoping to hear.  The customer service person told me that if I ordered the tv verbally over the phone it would get here more quickly because she could circumvent some of the on-line verification procedures.  so great!  I did the deal.  That was Aug 15.  Delivery date was projected to be Sept 2.  ug.for the next 2 weeks I checked their on-line service several times a day.  no progress!  I was getting worried that the set was going to be back-ordered and that it would take much longer.  finally on Aug 27th I get the email.  guess what?  it shipped from Cali and only took one day to get here.  but it's nerve-wracking to deal with the dell delayed-gratification system.  One great thing about dell:  for [...] they extended the factory warranty.  heck, the vizio website offered one year at [...] bucks.  also by purchasing the 1 year extension, Dell picks up all warranty dealings, so I don't have to deal with Vizio to get any warranty work done - just dell.setup was very simple, I currently have the backlight and brightness turned all the way off, and the contrast at about 60%.  My macbook pro has a DVI output, so a DVI to HDMI cable worked perfectly.  it took about 1 second for the TV to recognize and automatically pick up the MBP.  I am really happy with the results - I haven't been able to mount it to the wall yet, so it's still sitting on my desk, approx 3' from my face.  as a monitor, it is very good and I'm very pleased.  as a TV it's ok, but I'm not going to watch that much.  SD channels at 3' are not impressive (a good reason not to watch, right?).  The remote is minimal, and I miss my larger tv's capability of stretching/zooming/normal modes to deal with different channel's formatting.to sum up my long-winded post, I'm happy with the quality and the deal I got from Dell.  for less than most large computer monitors, I got a great external that's also a TV.
