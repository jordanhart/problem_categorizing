We would highly recommend this TV.  This TV is perfect for the small space that we have for it in our kitchen.

I just set it up tonight, and so far am pleased with it. Since the screen is only about two feet from my eyes the small screen size is not particularly an issue. Phenomenally it appears larger than the larger HDTV that I watch across the room at my friend's house. I can't give it 5 stars, though, because the picture does not appears as sharp and crisp as hers. But its still a heck of a lot better than the CRT set that it replaced, and its possible that it might be better after I tweak the settings. Overall, I am pleased that I bought this set, based on my research it appeared to be the best one to fit my needs, and so far I am forced to agree.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dave Kuhn 13.3 inch AC/DC RCA TV", "Author": "David Kuhn \"cuda22\"", "ReviewID": "R1OT5X1QDPTA8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic tv.

I wanted a portable battery-operated TV but apparently they do not make those anymore.  However, there are emergency rechargeable batteries that you can plug electronic devices into AND this TV can be plugged into automobiles so that pretty much fits the bill.  The LCD TV is also pretty good quality - very clear picture and sound and the DVD player is a definite plus.  I still wish we could just dump a couple D batteries in it and go but apparently that's no longer an option with any portable TV these days.  Frankly, RCA should look into doing just that - making their LCD TV operate on regular batteries.  In the case of Hurricane Sandy where there wasn't any power for a lot of people for weeks, recharging batteries WAS NOT AN OPTION!", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unsatisfactory", "Author": "Lu", "ReviewID": "R2YDYIMEOX5J73", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The write up on this product did not mention that it can not be viewed at an angle but MUST be viewed at eye level and straight on and this was most unsatisfactory for the location it was to be used as a kitchen TV.

I reviewed feedback on several different models of small TV's before purchasing this one.  This one has proven to have the same disappointments I read about other models - picture and sound.  The angle - up/down and left/right of the screen has to be square with your viewing angle or the picture is degraded.  This may be inherient in all LED models.  Most disappointing is the sound.  It has the tin sound instead of quality audio.  It appears RCA compromised the sound by using too small speakers to keep the depth of the TV thin.I will keep this one because I can't identify other models with any expectation they would be better.  The manufacturers have almost abandoned the small screen market.  It would be good if one of them would make a quality model without the DVD player, etc. that has the best picture and sound even if it cost more.  This one can't hold a candle to the Sony CRT model it replaced.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "DVD does not eject.", "Author": "Elmer Kraft", "ReviewID": "R169AB3EC3UJAS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have tried all ways I can think of but the DVD will not eject.

LCD Tilt Swivel Under Cabinet Mount\" (See my review of the mount under that product)  I shopped online quite a bit and while this wasn't the cheapest tv I found, it was the best price for a brand name that I recognized.The picture on this tv is really good - even in SD using RG-6 coax. Of course, HD using HDMI is even better. I installed in a corner and the picture is decent up to 45 degree angles, but best viewed straight on. (that mount I mentioned enables swivel/rotating to mitigate any viewing angle issues.) The sound is lousy, but that's common on tvs this size. The tv is really the perfect size for my kitchen. A really nice feature is the USB port - I put recipes organized by category in folders on a USB drive and it works great on the kitchen tv.There are a few things that could be better - RCA engineers take note... The wall plug is huge and ugly (2\" x 4\" x 1.5\").  The coax input sticks straight out of the side of the tv - pretty ugly too. The remote is very light-weight and cheap feeling. The contours and bulges on the back of the tv (due to the thickness of the DVD player) get in the way of the mounting bracket (I had to use spacers) and while it does have standard VESA mounting holes, they are off-center.  Loading DVDs is not intuitive - the correct loading of a dvd has the label side away from you and the mirror side of the dvd facing you.  Although its clearly labeled on the side of the dvd tray, one is typically in front of the tv, not on the side looking at the tray.  None of these are show stoppers for me but detract enough to earn only 3 stars.  I posted some images to show my under-kitchen-cabinet installation of this tv.

Yes you do have to look at it straight on, but that's not a problem for me as I watch it while I am on the computer at night.  I took it on a camping trip to VT. last week and ran it off a small 12v battery for one hour when I lost the sound, but still had a great picture.  Apparently the sound will cut out after the voltage gets below 11 or 10 volts with the small 12vdc battery.  The next night I ran it directly from my auto battery for almost 3 hrs. (no problems) The auto started fine the next morning also.  Having the built in DVD is nice when on a camping trip, when you can not pick up any TV stations. All in all for me not a bad little TV and I got for under $90 on black Friday.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "No regrets", "Author": "tdret", "ReviewID": "R3HTBI9CT5D2GI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect selection for our kitchen.

My buddies Visio TV, much larger, seems clearer on the 480P channels than this TV.The Buttons on top of the TV are backwards.  The slider bar on the volume goes to the left when pushing the button on the right, which is kind of foolish, but those buttons are rarely used anyway.I sent the first one back as the remote control did not function.  The speakers were all crackly/buzzy when new, and I voided the warranty by opening it up and tightening the mounting screws, which worked temporarily, but in the intervening year the buzzing has disappeared.For whatever reason my channel 10(actual) has an annoying crackle on it, but only on that particular channel.Sometimes channel 30.1(actual 38) will produce sound but no picture until I move to another channel than back to it.Seems to have slightly better reception than my previous 7\"  12 volt TV, and only draws ~0.3 amps more.Draws 0.9 to 1.1 amps watching  antenna TV and slightly more on a DVD, which is less than the rating and what I expected, which is nice for battery life.  It will draw 0.08 amps when it has power but is not turned on.  I put a switch on the power cord to reduce this unneeded battery draw.  It does not lose memory settings when all power is removedI have not used it with cable TV, or any of the other multitude of input options", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "This TV was DOA.", "Author": "Dwight Myers", "ReviewID": "R1SS8ZND5WF316", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item was returned it was DOA.

Croft", "ReviewID": "RLXMCLJV7W226", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My only complaints are two: first was that it was not delivered at the time promised, although that did not turn out to be a problem. The second and more important complaint would be the lack of adjustability of the monitor. It has a plastic pedestal that screws into the monitor with a single Phillips head screw. The screen is perfectly perpendicular to the flat surface it is placed upon and will not tilt. (It also does not swivel.) So if one happens to be sitting in a position such their their head is about level with this screen, all will probably be well. But if one is sitting at a desk--or worse, standing--the viewing angle is not likely to be good. We intended to use this at seminars to demonstrate DVD programs to attendees who would be standing, looking down at the monitor placed on a table. This wouldn't work, so we had to remove the pedestal and lay the monitor part on a slanted makeshift surface. On the upside, this unit is nice and light for putting in a suitcase, and is unique in terms of size and style.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "SMALL TV", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R37E0IIPTFNTXM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Needed small TV for kitchen.

I didn't have any of the problems that some of the negative reviews talked about but my big complaint is the same as every other.  The viewing angle is terrible!  One minor complaint was the amount of time it took for the TV to start up but I would barely ding the rating for that.  If not for the bad viewing angle, I'd be giving this a much better review...at least 4 stars.  However, This is a big deal and after a year, I still could not overlook this flaw.I used the TV in the master bath and even in that small area, the viewing angle made it hard to enjoy the quality of the picture, which otherwise was very good, when viewed straight on and at eye level.  However, this single MAJOR flaw is bad enough that I finally retired it and replaced it with a non-DVD, refurbished, 19\" Samsung that I LOVE.FWIW, I never used the DVD player...not even to test it.  I bought this based on price alone, which I almost never do but I figured it was a small risk, based on the price.

I am not bothered by the fact that you have to look straight at it to get the best visual - as other reviewers have stated.  I listen to the TV (news, etc) more than watch it when I am sewing.  A BIG plus for me - which I didn't realize it had when I ordered it (duh) was the CD playing feature.  Now I don't have to have a CD player in that room.
