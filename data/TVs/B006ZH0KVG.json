{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I am LOVING this TV!", "Author": "Marty Gillis", "ReviewID": "R11QW3V3RBSQZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am VERY pleased with this LG !  I am writing this review to help you decide whether or not this TV is worth upgrading to from you current set, how things look, sound, work, what needs improvement and what is totally cool!Interested? Then read on McDuff! But first just a bit of backstory.........<<<warning: Long but pretty detailed review>>>I purchased the LG 47LM7600 to replace my 2 year old LG 47 LE5400 which is now 'old tech'.  I wanted a larger screen and I wanted better overall picture quality.  The 3D , Web Browser and Apps were not a consideration for me, but this television IS fully loaded and I am glad to have them.This is my 2nd LG television and I was 90% happy with my LE5400 but the flash-lighting and screen uniformity issues were nagging at me with every Blu Ray I watched and finally I decided it was time to move on up! I have a 3D Oppo Blu Ray player that had never seen a 3D disc and I thought this was finally the time to jump in.Also, I watch A LOT OF TV folks! Home theater is my passion! I knew what I wanted to see from this new LM7600 and was very anxious to find out if I had made the right choice. (and with Amazon's 30 Day no cost return policy you are pretty much able to do this with no worries)You have already seen pictures of this television. It looks even better in person. Build quality seems nice and solid and with or without the included stand it is a joy to behold. While no longer featuring a matte screen, the reflective aspects are nowhere near as bad as my Kuro was and actually adds to perceived picture quality.  The 55 inch with stand comes in at around 55 pounds which is safe weight for most TV stands.  Mine is sitting on an OmniMount Echo 63-Inch Video Table  and seems perfectly stable and safe with a very good viewing height for 3D content.The stand, while heavy plastic designed to resemble metal, is extremely easy to put together and is the most stable of any TV stand I have ever had. It went together quickly and is solid as a rock. I wish it could tilt forward a bit as well as from side to side, but otherwise I like it very much.Be aware the HDMI jacks are in the side and close to the edge of the TV. If you don't want to see cable sticking out from the side of your 7600, then get some right angle HDMI cables.  Speaking of HDMI, I have noticed the HDMI Handshake time is VERY quick compared to any other TV's I have owned. It 'plays nice' with all my other equipment, including an iScan Duo and Oppo BDP-93.ON to the testing and my initial conclusions!The first thing ANYONE want to know is \"HOW DOES IT LOOK\" ?? Right out of the box the 7600 gives you a pretty good picture and after even the most basic calibration for contrast, back-light and brightness levels you can dial in a real jaw dropping image!  I started with Digital Video Essentials for my rough adjustments and then moved on the the Speer and Munsil Blu Ray for more precise settings.  For the technically challenged I would recommend the Disney Worlds of Wonder Blu Ray for easy and effective basic calibration.  Detail is noticeably enhanced from my LE5400 as are color accuracy and screen uniformity. Bothersome flash-lighting has almost been eliminated with just VERY small amounts peaking out the corners when no program material is being viewed.  Truly, it hard to believe this 7600 is edge lit at times and it's performance is more than adequate to satisfy anyone other than the totally hard core purist that will tolerate NO flash-lighting. Motion handling is smooth and not artificial looking.  I used Star Wars, Star Trek , and Lord of the Rings all on Blu to put this to the test. While no current LCD/LED television can do motion as well as a top grade plasma or the Sharp ELITE, this is so close to being there that I can happily live with it and not suffer any buyer remorse.  The more I watch, the more I have come to believe that motion is rendered so close to perfect that any real world improvement would be negligible for most viewing conditions.Unless you can afford a fully backlit LED set with full local dimming, this TV can give you the best picture for your dollar. It is bright, sharp, detailed and pops. The LED Plus DOES make a huge difference, coming from the LE5400.I was just watching a PAL Columbo DVD (an old 1971 episode) and was thinking to myself about how great this TV can handle standard DVD resolution.  A good trick is to engage the Mpeg Noise reduction to the \"LOW\" setting (found in the Picture options sub menu) and make sure your super resolution is turned on. I have been able to get near HD results from standard DVD'd doing this.  Great digital tool box in this TV and at no extra charge!Bottom line for PQ? I AM TOTALLY STOKED! If I could afford a new ELITE from Sharp I would buy one, but this LG television is at the top end of my price range and I feel it is a very good buy for my needs, providing a real solid upgrade in picture quality. The on-board processing upcoverts even SD to a whole new level, with 720p looking better than I ever thought it could!  Classic movies on TCM have taken on a  new visual level of quality now. COOL!Also, LG's passive 3D tech really works. The picture is sharp, bright and involving. The glasses are lightweight and easy to replace. The 2 to 3D conversion is a little strange, but more than usable for a lot of different things. The kids are gonna love it and that includes 57 year old kids like myself!  My 82 year old Dad liked watching ESPN 3D on MY set so much he now sits in front of his OWN Brand New LG Cinema screen 3D TV.Audio is another area that has been improved and VASTLY from my LE5400. It is nowhere near as tinny or weak sounding and more than good enough for casual viewing when I don't wish to fire up the 5.1 system. If you purchase this set, be prepared to at least plunk down a bit more for a decent sound-bar or home theater in a box system, and with a full blown 5 or 7.1 system connected you will find yourself in your own home theater. The optical audio output will pass 5.1 Dolby Digital  (the display on my Denon amp confirms this) The media player and software/hardware has been updated to include DTS core as well and THAT is a major improvement. However be aware this is ONLY the case while playing back 'local media files' via USB. All other audio is passed out the optical jack in STEREO ONLY even if your DVR or Disc Player is sending 5.1 ! Bummer! Seems the hardware is there, but the software is not allowing it to happen for some reason. Best to run your audio directly to your amp and bypass the TV in that regard for now.  The only file formats I have not been able to play are FLAC and ISO files. Even videos that my Oppo/iScan Duo combo have trouble with are easily rendered going straight into the LG via USB. VERY NICE!Connectivity is good with this set. Besides the prerequisite 4 HDMI connection you also get a dedicated HDMI audio return channel and an optical audio output. LG has bumped up the number or USB inputs to 3 and you can now connect a USB hub for all your external USB drives, one used for apps and one more for good measure. If your computer doesn't have HDMI you still get an RGB input.  You can still connect via component video (although it is being phased out now) so your old gear is still viable.  You can use the onboard wireless for your DLNA stuff or wire up to the LAN port. The combinations are pretty well thought out and there are enough options to accommodate most anyone's equipment.  I feed this display from an Iscan Duo which processes all my external devices but have my Fios HD DVR connected directly to the LG to eliminate an extra HDMI handshake and the LG video processing is totally up to the job.Where I live we can not be reached by over the air signals so I can't comment on how the onboard tuner behaves.  The scaler in the TV is pretty good and again it is much improved from just 2 years ago for upscaling to 1080p from your DVR or USB file source. The first time I tested the on-board media player I was floored by the image quality. I didn't expect it to be so good!Playing media files from DNLA or a USB drive is effortless with a nice well thought out on screen file browser. I have found one of LG's strong points is the sophistication and functionality of their operating systems. I like them! A LOT!The main complaint I have about this LG is the Magic remote. I DOES work and with practice it gets easier and then it gets pretty quick, but I would prefer LG would ship this with a standard remote in addition to the Magic one.  I use a Logitech Harmony One for everything except cursor functions and for me that is a better way to control things.  Rather than go with a wireless connection, I connected the LAN port to my Fios router and get a pretty snappy performance from Apps and the Net Browser. When I say snappy, I do NOT mean fast!  While featuring the same interface as the next two models up, the 7600 sports only a single core processor and as such between the TV OS and the apps the overall app/browser performance is sluggish.  I think some extra RAM would clear things up and am hoping for a firmware update that will allow an external USB stick to be used as such. Otherwise, there is a very good chance that you will be disappointed in the performance of the both the apps and the browser experience.  I do not use Netlfix anymore and can't comment on how well it works.  I plan to attach a camera for Skype and will post as to my results at a later date. (I am notorious for updating my tech reviews) ALSO, the included manual and even the online manual are just NOT very comprehensive and leave a LOT to be discovered by trial and error. If you are tech savvy at all this will be a non issue.So is this TV a safe bet? That depends how obsessive compulsive you are about your video quality. If you are willing to trade a very small amount of black level for what is most likely the best 3D around and and don't mind a semi reflective screen, then YES for the money this LG 7600 is a killer TV.  It looks good, sounds good, has plenty of features, options and is upgradable via USB.  I can play all my media files easily, MKV's and Xvids play and look great, SD is much improved and HD video is out of this world plus the LG's user interface is well thought out with some pretty mature software implementation. 10 years ago a television that looked this good and had this high level of function would have cost 20 thousand dollars or more. This is truly a great time to be a movie fan!I am guessing a very large percentage of buyers will be totally happy with this TV.As of now, I have ZERO buyers remorse and can recommend this LG with confidence.If any issues arise or I find new things that are notable I will edit my review.Cheers! Marty G***A word about Flashlighting, Vertical Banding, Clouding and Dirty Screen Effect. These are the artifacts or 'defects' that plague ALL edge lit LCD/LED panels. Some brands are better than others for keeping them at bay. The exact same model of TV may vary widely from unit to unit. My TV may have more artifacts present while another may not.Basically you need to evaluate your own TV for what you might consider an 'acceptable' level of any or all of these things. By the very nature of an edge lit displays design you just can not escape this, but manufacturing tolerances vary greatly and although you may need to possibly return one or more units you can eventually end up with one you can live with.My 7600 has some VERY slight flash-lighting in the top left hand corner. On horizontal pans of light background material you WILL see Vertical banding of varying degrees. I have found the more local dimming you use, the worse it will get.  I also have SOME dirty screen effect (Google it) and just a BIT of clouding depending on the program material.Just be aware that ALL these things are inherent in Edge Lit displays. If you just can't live with them (in my case, hardly ANY but still....) then you need to consider a plasma or a full array backlit LCD/LED not an edge lit TV.  Also, THOSE types of TVs ALSO have problems, just different ones. (halos, screen uniformity issues, stuck pixels, buzzing, excess heat, burn in, etc.)BOTTOM LINE: With the exception of possibly the new Sharp ELITE models ( more than 5k to start) there is currently no such thing as a perfect display.  Do not set your expectations higher than the technology will allow for.  I am VERY pleased with this 7600. It offers an increased level of fine detail that was not present in my Pioneer Kuro Plasma from 4 years ago.  The color accuracy is REALLY good and motion handling is the best of ANY TV I have had so far.  (I have had 6 including Plasma, DLP, CRT and LCD in the last 7 years)A word about adjusting your picture:  As a rule of thumb, RESIST THE URGE to put your backlight to 100!  The mistake many people make while trying to get a good picture is not understanding how to properly find the 'sweet spot' on their TV settings.  You want to leave yourself plenty of 'headroom' and not clip the visual dynamic range and end up with everything looking positively radioactive!Put your backlight down around 50 and crank up the contrast to around 85 , and play with your brightness control so that things are neither too dark or washed out. The more brightness you use, the more color intensity is needed, but adjust them in SMALL increments and test them on all types of material. Your cable box/dvr will need a different setting from your Blu Ray player. Every device sends a differently calibrated signal with different ideas of what constitutes a 'nominal' value.  I STRONGLY urge you to invest in the Disney Worlds of Wonder, Digital Video Essentials or the Spears and Munsil calibration disc. Do the best job you can , then let the electronics 'burn in' for around 100 hours or so and  do it again.  It is a tedious process but you will be rewarded with the best picture quality on your block and a much more enjoyable viewing experience! I am currently enjoying overall the BEST picture on ANY HDTV I have ever owned and can thank the Spears and Munsil disc for much of it.**As always, there ARE a small % of tech failures in electronics and purchasing an extended warranty would be a smart move as no matter how expensive something is, electronics DO fail and at the worst possible times.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Holy Crap!!!", "Author": "M. Corvin \"Corvinus\"", "ReviewID": "R3NOMHNPMBPSVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was walking through Best Buy a couple of weeks ago and the picture on this TV stopped me in my tracks! (seriously.) The Best Buy sales person stated it was running on the store's 720p satellite, which, if true, was even more stunning! The TV itself is sleek and sexy and minimalist. I love how there is virtually no physical border around the top and sides of the screen which is a great space-saver (you don't have a 2\" plastic frame around the picture, reducing bulk.After getting it home it was packed amazingly and the stand was very sturdy and assembled quite easily. The TV itself was heavier than I thought it would be so it took two people to get it up on the TV stand.Generous HDMI inputs as well as an optical and composite for older tech like my older Bose lifestyle home theater. I plan on hooking my new Mac Mini to this as the monitor. DROOL!The 3D is very nice and, in my opinion, better than the movie theater. I am not real informed on the differences between passive and active 3D glasses, other than one uses batteries and electronic shuttering and the others are, well, glasses with one side darker than the other. This is a passive TV and things are stunning and the TV comes with 6 pair. Also, if you need extra glasses for a larger group or replacement, the Real-D movie theater glasses work great so just bring a pair home...In regards to the on-board speakers, I never use them. If you have a TV this awesome you need a home theater with surround. Kind of like buying a corvette with a 4-cylinder in it. They are unobtrusive but do add to the bulk and weight of the unit and I wish they could be detached.The picture was great right out of the box but I have a very keen eye and I knew some adjustments needed to be made. LG has great software and a plethora of adjustment options, some fairly complicated for more advanced users. I would recommend putting the picture type on \"vivid\". It will blow your mind! The picture and contrast and color are incredible. I will say that animated features are stunning! Just Stunning. I recommend watching Puss In Boots 3D Bluray and the animated movie \"9\" on Bluray (non-3D) to see what I am talking about. I watched Tangled on Bluray last night and...wow!Other reviewers mentioned \"edge flashing\" or \"bleed\" and I have noticed this as well, but only on menus and things, NEVER when it counts, like during a movie. Blacks are inky and nice.The magic remote is nice and if you have played a Wii you will be right at home. Overall I feel it works well but needs some accuracy tweaking.On-board 2D-3D conversion is pretty cool but not as good as something filmed in 3D.BUY THIS TV!***UPDATE 4-2-2012***It's been about two weeks since my purchase and this TV is still as bad-ass as ever! I'd give it 6 stars if I could!***UPDATE 8-18-2013***Still bad-ass as ever!!!", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV...Please Read. I reviewed the 55\" LM6700.", "Author": "Brandon L.

This is hands down the most aesthetically pleasing television on the market (Samsung a close second). Here is a rating (Out of 5)  of all the features that are important to some and ultimately important to most at some point.- Design (5)- Picture quality out of the box (4.5)- Screen (5) Screen is a slight gloss. Not as reflective as most Samsung models- 3D (5) Passive technology. Many settings and options for this feature.- 2D-3D Conversion (5) gives more depth to your Blu-rays and shows.- Smart TV features (4.5) A little slow but good, expected to get better with updates.- Magic Motion Remote (4) Fun to use once you get used to it, could be more accurate.- Local Dimming (5) Make great black levels with deep contrast.- 240hz True Motion (5) Many setting for this feature.- Edge-lit (5) Could not tell that this tv was edge lit, very deep contrast.- Game mode (5) No sign of lag when playing MW3 online. Takes time to adjust the setting but worth it.- 3D Glasses (5) 6 pairs of passive glasses. Light weight, doesn't require batteries, great value- Price (5) It pays for itself because it will keep you home and not at the theatreFor the record, I was never an LG fan. I purchased this set so its worth taking a look people. Now I have one last thing to say, If your a Television maker and your name starts with an \"S\" its your move......

features (if you are lucky enough to receive one without defects).", "Author": "real review", "ReviewID": "R2YGWDIWRJ2JLF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "**Review for 55LM7600**Yes, a nice TV.  Great?  Well, it could be, but there are some issues that LG will need to work on.The Good:Looks:  LG really came up with a neat design where looks are concerned.  The ultra thin bezel that surrounds the tv looks sharp.  Others who have reviewed this TV have stated that the bezel is metal, but what I see is plastic.  A nice durable stainless steel bezel would have been preferred, but LG decided not to go that route.  The ribbon stand gives the TV a look that makes you think it's floating in air, another nice touch.  Speaking of the stand, the stand is also plastic.  Long term durability may be an issue, but so far so good.  Again, something at the very least reinforced with metal would have been preferred since there is a rather large investment being held up by this engineered piece of plastic.Picture Quality:  There are pros, and cons.  The pros are that the picture is beautiful.  With a little tweaking colors are rich and vibrant (LG ships the TV with the picture tuned to the cool side, which at first made the picture appear a bit weak and a tad washed out).  Black levels are not the best, but I have to say that to my eye they are completely satisfactory.  While you may think that you are looking into a black hole while watching a plasma TV when screen goes dark, you won't get that reaction here.  I don't feel that this is enough reason though to pass on this TV or to detract from it's rating.  With the help of LED dimming on this TV, the black level is still very respectable.Panel uniformity is very good, I have to admit that I had to order a replacement due to issues with the backlight bleeding through and causing the dreaded flashlight effect with the first TV that arrived (light carried around 7 inches out from the corners), but the second set resolved the issue with light colored corners and blacks that looked grey.  There is still a small amount of light bleed at the top of the screen (about a \u00bc inch band), but nothing that detracts from normal viewing.  My experience has shown that to date there is no \"perfect TV\" on the market, with any new TV there seems to be some type of compromise.  If flashlighting, blooming, edge bleeding, or blooming are going to be a huge issue for someone, my advice is to purchase a LCD TV with a standard florescent backlight, or direct LED backlight (plasma is another option, but the Panasonic ST30 I upgraded from suffered from burn in).  Every LED edge lit LCD TV I have seen to date has shown these issues from one extent or another.  You may not be able to see these issues in a brightly lit room or on the showroom floor of your local electronics retailer, but when you take it home and the lights dim, they will be waiting for you.Motion Handling:  With the fast response time of the panel used in this television, motion handling was super as far as any LCD TV is concerned.  One thing that did concern me was that in researching the panel used in this TV, the panel refresh rate is not a true 240Hz but rather a 120Hz panel and a 240Hz effect achieved from \"flashing\" the back-light.Viewing Angle:  This TV features an IPS LCD panel and as far as viewing angles go, this type of panel will give you the second best viewing angle of all currently available TV's.  Plasma and the soon to be available OLED are the only others to offer a better viewing angle.  A conservative guess to my eye would be an off axis viewing angle of about 75 degrees before losing picture quality.  Compared to the Samsung LED lit LCD I once owned this is nearly twice the off axis viewing angle I experienced before.  If you decide to purchase any type of LCD TV I highly recommend making sure you look for a model with an IPS panel.3D:  Ok, I have to admit this feature is pretty cool.  Before owning the LG we had a Panasonic plasma set that was also 3D capable, but with the price of the 3D glasses we never used it.  LG not only offers passive 3D viewing, but they also include 6 pairs of glasses in the box.  This is great because the glasses are light, comfortable, they don't require batteries, and the movie theatre glasses work just as well as those included.  The 3D picture quality is outstanding with no cross talk, and amazing depth.  Objects not only appear to jump off the screen at you, but they also appear to jump out in the distance through the screen and the wall behind it.USB:  If you happen to have media backed up on a hard drive and would like to view content on your TV, LG has you covered.  The USB ports support external devices and all types of content including MP4 and MKV.Cons:Magic Wand remote:  For normal TV use the magic wand remote is a bit of a pain to use.  We quickly turned to a universal remote so that we can directly input channels and easily use features such as last channel.  If you are using the web browser, the wand remote is easier to use, but we don't find much use for the built in browser.Built in browser:  The good news is that the built in browser supports flash, the bad news is that not all features on web pages seem to work.  We enjoy using web services such as Crackle, and viewing past television programs on their respective networks websites.  While the video does play, we have not found a way to enable full screen viewing.  For this reason, we don't find ourselves using the web browsing feature much.Flashlighting / Edge Bleeding:  Here is where LG really loses points on an otherwise great product.  The first set that was delivered had a terrible flashlight effect in the corners of the screen.  So bad in fact that dark scenes would appear gray, and colors were a bit washed out.  I understand that all LED edge lit TV's have this issue to some extent, but this was really bad.  When you look at the price of these products, you expect more.  The second set does show some bleeding along the top edge with small arches of light showing from where the LEDs are positioned around the edge, but this is really only seen in a completely dark room with the TV tuned to a channel with no signal.  By doing this, you are looking at a black picture and the TV appears to disable the LED dimming.  This is not however a real world scenario for viewing.  During normal viewing there are times when the top \u00bc inch of the screen shows a little edge bleed, but it's again in a completely dark room when it can be seen.Dead Pixels:  I was not expecting this.  While watching one day on the second set that was delivered the screen changed to a commercial with a white background.  There in front of me was a small black dot that upon further inspection turned out to be a dead pixel.  Being that I had already exchanged one set for issues with flashlighting in the corners, the second set was returned and I called it quits with the LM7600 (as a side note, the meter on the TV showed only 136 hrs when the dead pixel appeared).Menus:  We have found the menus to be a bit difficult and not entirely intuitive to use.  The manual is extremely poorly written and offers little to no help with navigating the features of the TV.  Along with the difficulty in using the menus, we also find it awkward that the channels are not placed in numerical order, but instead are separated by channel type.  What you end up with is a separate channel listing for digital, air, and cable channels.  It would be nice if LG would have grouped all the channels together so that TV channel 2 is just one click away from digital 2-1 instead of having to flip through all the air or cable channels to get to the digital channels and vice versa (see magic wand remote).Overall: If I had not experienced dying pixels on the second set, I would have gladly given a rating of four stars (subtracting one star for the flashlighting effect experienced by the first set).  With the experience of having received two TV's that both had problems, and taking into consideration the price one will pay for the 55LM7600 I am forced to give a rating of one star to the LG 55LM7600.  Maybe my expectations are unrealistic, but I expect value equal to the number of dollars I spend, and this experience really missed the mark.*I feel it is important to add the model reviewed was the 55LM7600.  Different sized versions may or may not perform the same way due to the inherent differences in manufacturing LCD panels.*", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2MQ7MJVVQQA9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is the second time I've ever written a review on any product but I was just so pleased with this TV and could someone else make a decision that I thought I would take the time to do it.First off I was a little concerned about ordering such a big object and having it delivered. It arrived and the carrier brought it into the house and the box looked like I had brought it home from the store myself, not a mark on it. The carrier opened the box and we went thru it and made sure the screen wasn't damaged and all major parts were there. He offered to place it where ever I wanted it and take all the trash and boxes away. So that part was 5 stars in itself.I had just had shoulder surgery last week so I was using one arm doing this (not bragging just pointing out how easy it is to get this up and going). Mounted the stand to the tv and set up on the tv stand in no time.Second part was hooking the TV up with the cables and then getting it to merge with our cable box and internet. Being 55 I have done this a few times with different types of TVs but this was about the easiest . I'm not going to lie I DID have a problem with AUTO TUNNING. It would not pick up any of my cable channels so I called my cable co. and they talked me thru it and helped me sit up my cable remote also in less than 15 min.Now I ALWAYS have problems connecting items via my router. I read reviews where people say it took them 2 min. and they were up and running NOT so with me. Well with this TV in two min I was up and running, the Tv recognized my router with no problems. I was AMAZED.Now the important part, the clarity just blew me away. I thought my older Panasonic was clear. But this TV just floored me. I didn't really care about the 3D part but when I saw a 3d movie I put in it was great and Lg gives you 6 pair of glasses..Over all I would not Hesitate to get this TV, I don't think you will be disappointed at all..", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cabibration LG47LM7600", "Author": "Khang Nguyen \"Calvin\"", "ReviewID": "R5P6MAZGWZSCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LG LM7600 Series Calibrations and Picture SettingsCalibrated Picture Settings: We utilized to 2-point white balance control to get close to D6500K without having to go the full 20-point white balance route.

I will say the picture out of the box was not hat great, but after tweaking it for a while and using the Picture Wizard I am very happy with what I have now.For those that do not have a TruMotion option you will need to contact LG or whomever you purchased the set from and get a new one, as this option is available on my TV. Someone had mentioned that they already contacted LG support; I just wanted to confirm that the option is available on my 55LM7600.I am coming from a 1080i TV, so the picture on this TV with my PS3 and the Blu-Ray disk of Casino Royale was more than I could ask for. The beginning of the movie has a ton of motion with swirling colors and a killer chase scene at a construction site. I saw no blur at all. It was smooth and flawless. I have watched this Blu-Ray many times on my other TV and all I can say is Wow. This was during the day and even with open window shades the reflection was minimal, from where I was sitting.I was able to hook up to my network and view the content of all my devices. This includes a Windows Vista and Windows 7 PC and my EVO phone.The online selection is vast and I was able to play with a few things. Google Earth looks awesome on this TV. I did not have the problems with Netflix that others are having but I am using a wired connection since I already had cable run for my PS3.Someone mentioned that they saw flash lighting on the screen when they accessed the different apps, or changed the input source. I have that also but they go away right before the app or program starts, so it's not hurting my picture at all. I'm not sure why it does it but it does. During the blackest scenes I see no flash lighting at all.The magic remote is what it is. I don't really have a problem with it except the arrow goes off the screen to fast for my liking and I am still looking for a setting to change that. So if you are reading something on the screen or trying to figure out which app to select if you don't move the remote for 5(?) seconds it goes off and you have to shake it again to get it back on. Other than that, I like it. Way easier to navigate around the menus than up up up, left left left left. Plus the scrolling wheel makes the navigation a breeze, especially when you are going through 1000's of pictures or music from your PC or phone.The sound from the TV is fine for 10 watt tiny speakers. The sound bar helps a ton. I don't have a receiver that can handle the TV yet, so I was unable to try out surround and all that good stuff.I was able to try out the 3D and it looks great. I really haven't tweaked the settings or played around with it much, but out of the box it looks good. And with the passive system you can actually lie down and watch it, try that all you active 3D people. Of course the glasses are light weight like the theater glasses and I didn't have any problems in the hour I was watching it. The 2D to 3D conversion seems to work well. I didn't see any ghosting or other anomalies while watching.I was able to find the correct codes for my Xfinity (Comcast) remote control, so I can change the input source and move through all the TV settings without having to use the magic remote. Of course it is easier to navigate with the Magic Remote.The sound bar does turn on and off with the TV, which is nice, but you can only control the volume with the remote that came with the bar. I have not tried to input the codes into my Comcast remote yet. On a side note the sound bar is blue tooth so I can stream music from my phone over it. Kinda cool.I watched Hanna from the HD Cable source in the dark and I still couldn't see any flash lighting or problems with the set.For me this was a great purchase and I'm very happy with the set overall.Post any questions and I will see if I can give you an answer.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is an outstanding and Simply SMART TV!!!", "Author": "K. Valentine \"Endless Ideas\"", "ReviewID": "R3EE8L4D09DZ8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV!!!  Good looks, excellent picture quality, and Simply SMART!.I bought the 47LM7600 from Amazon with a special deal which included a LG Sound Bar (NB3520A) and six pair of glasses. I paid $1660 for the package.  I also bought a Sanus VMF308 full-motion wall mount ($98 thru J&R;) and a LG BD670 Blu-Ray player ($119) both from Amazon.This TV will replace a 37\" Sharp LCD flat panel I purchased in 2005 with 1 HDMI input and 1 DVI input - the rest component, S-Video and RCA-jacks. That TV is going to our bedroom. I also purchased a 7.1 SONY surround sound receiver and built a complete system in 2005 that I'm still very happy with.I was considering the Samsung 46\" ES8000, but the reviews on Amazon weren't too favorable. The LG I bought and the Samsung were the only two I considered as I didn't want to exceed the wall space I have which is 42.25\" with the LG at 41.9\".  I didn't want it covering a door molding. I also wanted some sort of Internet connected TV for use with Netflix, etc.Comments:1. This TV is a real beauty with a thin Stainless steel bezel and a 1/4\" black border under the one-piece glass screen. Not having any bezel is really neat. It looks like the black obelisk at the opening of '2001- A Space Odyssey.' Everyone who sees it WOWS over it.  It has a low gloss screen finish with only a tiny red LED light indicating it's off. The red light is off when the TV is on.2. The picture out of the box is outstanding via the HDMI connection. I plan to do some fiddling with the brightness, contrast, color etc. The only issue I had with the set-up was it took a little while for the HDMI to work. I would get just a black box covering most of the screen but the sound was on and playing and the video was playing outside the blacked off area on both ends of the screen. Then after about two minutes - the full picture appeared and it has performed flawlessly ever since. I'm using a Time Warner Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8240HDC DVR box to run the unit. I guess it had a slow handshake with HDMI and the TV.3. I liked the package as it included the LG NB3520A sound bar with the wireless subwoofer. The 37\" Sharp it is replacing had a built in sound bar at the bottom of the TV and it gave excellent surround sound. I will agree with the reviewer who said the speakers are very good. And they are at lower volumes. When the sound is cranked up, the small built-in speakers sound tinny -you just can't get great bassy sound out of a space that small. At least these TV speakers fire down rather than to the rear. The sound bar unit had no problem setting up and registering with the wireless subwoofer. It was a painless process. It also comes with a remote that has a section designed to control the LG TV. You can turn it off/on and adjust the volume. My wife is electronically challenged and this will make it very easy for her to use. The 7.1 system and all the bells and whistles were too complicated.The only thing I don't like about the sound bar is the black GLOSSY plastic housing. I wish it were a honed or matte finish which would reduce the reflection. It is hard to injection mold a piece of plastic that long without getting some waviness on the surface. It's not a big deal but picky, picky on my part. I'd be happy if they sold it with an acoustic fabric on it to reduce the reflection. But LG and some other manufacturers seem to like the industrial look of the 6 `bare' speakers.I used LG's template to install the sound bar under the TV with a recommended 4\" space. My wife and I think it's too far so I'll remount the sound bar so it's just 1\" or so below the TV. This is a personal taste matter - like hanging a picture at what height is the correct height?4. Magic Remote Control.  This thing is really clever - like the Wii remote. It is very easy to use. One reviewer said the thing doesn't aim correctly - as the axis of the remote and where the arrow is on the screen don't match.This is not a big deal to me as this remote is based on RF - radio frequency - and not the almost ubiquitous IR - InfraRed requiring a clear line of sight.  You can put it behind your head and move it around and the arrow is always somewhere on the screen. You have to shake it slightly to get the arrow to appear - so if you move it slowly the arrow won't appear at all. I like it and its so easy to use!!!5. 3D and the glasses. The Samsung has active 3D glasses and the LG has passive glasses - the latter a la movie theater types. CNET Reviews have favored active-type glasses better - but a recent study by some `experts' on the CNET website are now saying passive is just as good or better than active shutter glasses. To me the active glasses would be somewhat of a pain as they need batteries and might be more delicate with kids.The 2 >3D button works and is fun to watch. I didn't really want a 3D TV - but the high-end ones only come that way. After 3 days - I now find its fun to watch in 3D - and the very young grandkids love it trying to pluck things out of the air!!6. Happy surpriseI hooked up the TV to the LAN via the recommended wire connection. That was also a flawless process and I jumped onto Google and it worked perfectly. I only played with it for 5 minutes. (I couldn't figure out how to make it show full screen - so back to the manuals  ;-).But the real Happy Surprise was getting a message in Windows Vista that Windows Media Player could connect with the LM7600 TV and play music, videos and photos on the TV. It asked did I want to set this up? I said with some trepidation.... Yes ...and it said connected successfully. But no other comments or dialogue box was present.A while later, I went to change inputs and used the Magic remote to bring up all the inputs - and there was the name of my PC as another available input. Holy Cow! So I selected that input and it brought up the folders for photos, music and videos. I selected a home video and it played. I was really impressed!7. The second Happy surprise....This morning when I turned on the TV there was a message from LG that there was an update to the TV firmware and did I want to install it? I said yes and off it went. It gave me a version number of the successful update and I guess I can go look that up to see what it does.I also hooked up the BD670 Blu-Ray player with a LAN corded connection rather than use my router.8. The wall mount - Sanus VMF308I had the Sharp on a fixed wall mount I installed in 2005. `Fixed' meaning I couldn't pull it away from the wall. In the past, I lost the HD connection via a HDMI - DVI adaptor as the newer cable boxes came with HDMI only and not DVI. So everything I watched for the last 2 years was via Component (analog) and less than HD. If I had to take the TV off the wall to use the single HDMI port - I would have had to remove most of the cabling (and there was a lot of it with component and RCA jacks).  I have the TV mounted on a wall in the family room, and the cables go thru that wall into my study with all components in a wall cabinet. I use a Niles IR Repeater to get the signal to the various components in the study. But it's a clean and neat setup with no visible wiring or components.  So for the new TV I wanted to get a super-slim wall mount that could glide away from the wall if I wanted to add/remove/change cables.I found a Sanus VMF308 mount that's only 1.1\" thick when flat, yet extends 8\" off the wall. It also tilts left, right and down and slides left to right, and right to left about 4 inches. That's enough room to work on cables. It's sold by J&R; Electronics thru Amazon for $98. I think that's a great bargain compared to the brick and mortar stores.It has the VESA 400 bolt pattern for this 47\" TV and works great. (Edited:  April 11, 2012: This wall mount model WILL handle 55\" as that also uses a VESA 400 bolt pattern. This is per the owner's manual.) I decided to hacksaw away a \u00bd' by 2\" part of the bracket that goes on the TV as the power cable would be squashed by the mount. This could be easily remedied by using the range of spacers Sanus provides - but I wanted it to be as close to the wall as possible.This setup has the TV and mount a total of only 2.5\" off the wall. It is wonderful.In summary I am thrilled with this really slick and SMART TV. I'm a retired engineer and I'll post updates as I discover things.Hope this is useful to everyone!EDITED April 19, 2012I uploaded two photos of the sound bar location below the TV. The LG template has it 4\" below but it was too far in our opinion. So we reinstalled it with just a 1\" space which we like better. See photos.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "A TV TO LOVE!", "Author": "Elder Dave \"adman62\"", "ReviewID": "R1AF06EO4BGI89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LG Cinema Screen 55LM7600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses I lived with a 37\" LG 1080i for 7 1/2 years and was very happy with the set. I'd have stayed with it if 3-D had not come along. More on this later.The set is beautifully designed--the stand is elegant, the wide expanse of screen a joy. The remote takes a little getting used to, but after a few minutes it becomes almost second nature. I mostly use my DirecTV remote or the remotes for my Oppo 93 or Onkyo home theater in any case. Just to get it out of the way, the sound is fine--as good as you might expect on a TV, perfectly o.k. for listening to most of what's on the TV. If it's a concert or a broadcast 5.1 movie I want to listen to, I'll go to my home theater, but most things are very listenable on the set's speakers.The picture: when I first saw it at Costco sitting between a Samsung and a Sony, I found it hard to believe my eyes. The LG (it was a 47\") seemed brighter, sharper, with more clarity and deeper color than either of the others. I put on the passive glasses (so much better than active shutter glasses!) and I, and a friend who was with me, felt out jaws hit the floor. I had never seen 3-D this good anywhere.We both reached out instinctively to accept a bouquet of flowers from this beautiful woman before sheepishly realizing what we were doing.I went home, cogitated for a few weeks, and finally ordered the 55\" version from an on-line e-tailer (not Amazon, although Amazon is one of my favorite sources). A friend helped me set it up-- at 73 I'm not so good at hauling 55 lb. TV's onto stands and screwing them together by myself. Within 45 minutes we had it set up and I had plugged in 4 components. I fired up the Oppo, and we watched \"Hugo\" (superb film!). The 3-D was absolutely remarkable. My friend, who usually says he really could not care less about 3-D, loved it and remarked over the phone later that he was still brushing snow off his sleeve from the opening scene.I have been a fan of 3-D since the 50's, but I have always regretted that often there would be ghosting, crossover, or any of the projection errors that can strain your eyes and give you headaches. Still, I loved 3-D. On this TV, I have experienced none of these effects. The picture is crystal-clear, always in focus, easy to view without noticeable eyestrain or headache. I have viewed numerous 3-D films on Blu-ray played on my Oppo 93, and the experience has been uniform, even with films as darkly shot as \"Immortals 3-D\". I've also watched a number of 2-D films such as \"The Tree of Life\" and found a remarkable depth of color and clarity that enhanced the film over a previous viewing. This set reproduces film beautifully.Some mention the flashlighting effect as an annoyance. I must be one of the lucky ones; I have never seen anything resembling flashlighting on the screen. Perhaps models now being shipped have been improved; I don't know. Happily, it's not a problem for me.LG provides many apps and services on screen, one of my favorites being 3-D World with many free programs from aquariums, travelogs, documentaries, etc. These are well shot and beautifully presented, something for everyone. There's even one on pro wresting! Of course, you can access YouTube, Netflix, and other sources for streaming purposes if you so wish. Dependent upon your connection speed, these can be a little slow in response. They're not important to me, but if they are to you, you might want to consider the 8600 which has a dual core and should make streaming better. Or...get a good streaming 3-D player to speed the action!I also got DirecTV's HiDef DVR package. There are two full-time 3-D channels (one is ESPN) and an on-demand channel as well as a 3-D Pay-per-View movie channel. There's a lot of 3-D available. I've noticed, by the way, that even feed from my vcr (yes, I still have a vcr!)looks great on this set. It's an all-around winner.If I had any suggestions for LG, I would say that I would appreciate an easier way to choose inputs. Extra buttons on the remote might do it.O.K. All I can say is that friends and family are delighted watching films on this set (both 2-D and 3-D), and I have not heard a single comment that hasn't been totally complimentary. My friends are great, but they can sometimes be ascerbic. I guess they haven't found anything to criticize on this LG.I wholeheartedly recommend this set to anyone who wants a brilliant picture, both 2-D and 3-D. I would certainly buy it again.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Projector Junkie Converted", "Author": "Tina", "ReviewID": "R1QFXB0HM8V65D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the last 7 years my husband and I have owned only DLP projectors. We liked the ability to being able to choose our screen size up to 300 inches plus the smaller size of the units adding portability to them. With 3D becoming more mainstream we decided to take our first step into the 3D world via a flat panel TV instead of another projector.After doing some research on 3D HDTVs in the 55\" size and comparing the various features and prices between LG, Sony, Samsung, Panasonic, and a slew of other brands of which I cannot recall, we settled on the LG 55LM7600.Since many of the stats on the different brands on TVs of this size match each other in quality we focused on the 3D aspect.Research on the Passive 3D technology that LG uses on this television versus the Active 3D available on many brands reveled many benefits that we hadn't thought of while looking purely at the television itself.Price - The cost of replacement glasses.If you have kids, animals, or a very clumsy husband (mine is) then you know as you pull the glasses from the box that they are going to get broken or lost. There is no question about it. You realize right away that your friendship with your new 3D glasses is only temporary and that you shouldn't get too attached. Like an office co-worker. You appreciate the time you get to spend together at work chit chatting and keeping yourselves from the tedium that your cubicle holds for you, but you still keep yourself distant. If you see each other in public you might politely wave and say hello but you both know that it is only a matter of time before one of you moves to a new job or is moved to a new department. This is the relationship you have with your 3D glasses. We have had this TV (at the time of this review) for only about a month and after watching only a few 3D movies, we have already misplaced one of the 6 pairs of 3D glasses this unit came with. Replacement cost long term is a factor and in this area Passive 3D wins.Comfort - How long can you wear them?I wear eyeglasses on a daily basis. The ones I purchased from the eye center are so light I often forget I am (or not) wearing them. I don't want a constant reminder that they are there on my face. A quick Google search or a trip to your local best buy and you can see just how bulky and heavy the Active 3D glasses are versus the Passive 3D. I can easily wear the LG Passive 3D glasses over my own glasses and while it is kind of an awkward feeling, they reminiscent of the old paper 3D glasses in weight and easily stay in place and I soon forget I'm wearing them during the movie.Ease of Use - How easily can I put on a pair and go?Active 3D glasses must be charged. The last thing on my mind after an evening of sitting down and watching a good 3D movie is making sure I put my 3D glasses back to charge. I can;'t even remember to charge my cell phone half the time! If the  glasses are not charged your plans for movie night get ruined. This was something that the LG Passive 3D would help us avoid and this was a simple choice.The last couple points about the Active 3D vs Passive 3D. Quality and Eye Fatigue.Quality of picture - From what we read the quality is higher on the Active 3D and this gave us pause. However after actually using the LG 3D Passive glasses it became clear that any quality lost is actually almost unnoticeable to even my video/audio snob of a husband. I am not sure if this is limited to the LG Passive versus other brands, but if it is then LG did a wonderful job.Eye Fatigue - Passive 3D lacks the eye fatigue associated with Active 3D glasses.240Hz - Let me just say that the 240Hz is amazing. I know that they go even higher than this in the TV world now. Our first flat panel purchase (not 3D) last year was a 120Hz for the bedroom. Since we'd be used to 60Hz jumping up to 120Hz required a bit of an adjustment period. I know that for me the best way i could describe it is \"this is tripping me out it's so smooth!\" My husband on the other hand dug it right away and fell in love with how smooth everything was. The 240Hz on the LG 55LM7600 required yet another adjustment period. It is amazing how smooth the picture on this thing is!Many people have complained on blogs and forums about how the ultra smoothness detracts from what you are viewing, making it seem too real, and detracting from the fantasy world that a movie attempts to pull you into. I would have to agree with this AT FIRST. But, after a few days I noticed that I had gotten used to the smoothness and the ability to get pulled into movies again returned quickly. My suggestion would be to watch a lot of your regular TV shows for a few days until your eyes and brain adjust and then delve into one of your favorite 3D bluray videos that have been sitting on the shelf waiting to be experienced.I also do a lot of gaming. Hooking my laptop up to this television is SUPER easy. My laptop recognized the TV and I was ready to go in less than 30 seconds. There is one issue with this television that is actually inherent in all HDTVs and that is a lag between PC or Console and TV. It's actually a processing lag the TVs suffer when decoding the data sent. So when gaming I found that dropping the resolution down to 720p and choosing Game mode on the television made it 100x more bearable. So be aware when looking for your new 3D HDTV that there is lag, and you can minimize it, but ALL HDTVs have this and as of yet manufacturers have not worked this kink out.I can't speak for the remote that comes with the system as my husband immediately programmed it into our Logitech Harmony 900 Rechargeable Remote with Color Touch Screen, but I will at some point give it a try.Overall, the TV surpassed most of my expectations quality-wise. I know from research that the LG Passive 3D technology is some of the best, if not THE best, Passive 3D available.- The picture is astoundingly clear and smooth.- It was a snap to set up in under an hour with the wall mount kit that we purchased (Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B Flat Screen TV Wall Mount Bracket for 32-65-Inch Plasma LED LCD TV).- The menus are easy to navigate, and the software setup walked you through a first time wizard.- There are enough HDMI ports on the tv for most things and they are easy to get to on the side.- The built in Wi-fi is a major plus and was easily set-up during the first run wizard. I have no regrets in purchasing this TV and would happily recommend to friends and family.- The TV is amazing light, VERY thin, and the bezel frame is extremely small!", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "If You're Looking for 3D, Look No Further...", "Author": "IAMSLICK", "ReviewID": "R3B171W5RSIWDV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If You're Looking for 3D, Look No Further, because I believe at this size, the LG 55LM7600 has probably the best price/performance of any TV on the market.  It has a beautiful design that minimizes the footprint it occupies to provide you with a 55\" screen.  I wish I had gotten the 60\" because it probably would have been about the same overall size as my existing Toshiba 55\" LED with its big plastic frame around the screen.  This TV is razor thin too, so you can easily hang it on a wall.It's one drawback is that the remote, while innovative and intuitive to use, ends up being somewhat of a hinderance.  The shape of the remote causes it to tip over, roll off the couch, etc.  It is not well balanced.  Also, since you are kind of using it like a computer mouse to control the TV, after a few seconds of non-use the cursor disappears from the TV screen, which means you have to wave the remove around to get the cursor to re-appear.  I find this annoying.  Since I have Uverse TV service with a universal remote, I instead use the Uverse remote as much as possible, and that mostly alleviates this concern.The non-3D video performance of this TV is only OK in my opinion.  I am comparing this TV to a Toshiba 55UX600U 55\" LED TV.  The Toshiba picture is insanely good...don't know that I've ever seen one better.  And that's straight out of the box with NO tuning whatsoever.  The LG 55LM7600 on the other hand definitely needs tuning.  I bought the Disney Wow Blu Ray home theatre tuning kit, and that helped improve the picture significantly.  My biggest hint is that you want to change the aspect ratio from 16:9 mode to \"Just Scan\".  I also made some small tweaks to contrast, brightness and color.3D performance on regular programming is OK.  The TV adds a little bit of depth (maybe 6-12\") to give the illusion that you are watching 3D, at the expense of clarity.  The picture gets a little bit blurry.  I don't know how useful this feature is, to be honest with you.  I like a crystal clear, vibrant picture above all things.  We watched the Kentucky Derby in 3D, and then took our glasses off and re-watched it in normal mode.  It was much clearer and more pleasing just in normal mode in the opinion of everyone in our family of 5.3D performance on true 3D programming is wonderful.  Easily as good as you would get in any theatre.  The amount of 3D content out there is fairly small, and it can be expensive, but I think it is an evolving technology that will become more prevalent.  I have tried Uverse on demand 3D and 3D Blu Ray and both are great, with a slight advantage to the 3D Blu Ray.The advanced capabilities of the TV are excellent.  I think surfing the internet natively on the TV is very useful and very well done.  I wish it worked with ESPN-3 and some of the other video providers out there, but for basic internet it works great and connects very easily either wirelessly or via LAN cable to your home internet.  If you don't have a LAN jack near the TV, powerlink networking can help you put internet connectivity near the TV.  You get much higher performance this way vs. wireless which only has a very short range.  My TV is 50ft from my Uverse router and only gets about 1/2 bandwidth.  This is the same as I get on my Toshiba TV.  There are also video services available within the menu system of the TV, so you basically can get anything you want from a content perspective right at your fingertips.  There is even some 3D Nature content that my kids like, and it's free.All in all this TV is a big investment.  If 3D is your primary driver, then this TV won't let you down.  If you covet a crystal clear picture above all things and 3D is a nice to have, then you may want to compare this TV with a few others first.  But make no mistake about it, this TV is a solid set that probably 95% of people will be thrilled to own.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stellar!!... !", "Author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\"", "ReviewID": "R5VPDY3BCLN5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SUMMARY:  This is a great set and I can't imagine anyone not being happy with it.  However,  I wouldn't expect you to buy this set based on my (or any other) review.  My best suggestion is to make it a point to add this to whatever other sets you plan on seeing before buying anything.LOVE THE PICTURE: Like just about every other reviewer I think this set is remarkable!  It renders images with a crystal clarity that is almost unsettling.  I can watch things I've seen before and it's like seeing them for the first time.  With its 240 Hz refresh rate motion is \"real life\" smooth.  Unlike Plasma sets you can have windows behind you or to the side and not have excessively distracting glare.FREE GLASSES: And the 3D is at least as good as I've seen in theaters.  The thing I really like are the passive glasses.  The ones provided are very comfortable.  What I've never seen mentioned (though I'm sure it has) is that you can get more glasses (and to me glasses that feel a bit more substantial) for \"free\".  It turns out the \"Reel 3D\" glasses they give you at the movies work just fine with this set.  Another benefit is you can get child sized \"Reel 3D\" glasses either from those same theaters or on your favorite on-line auction site.  Adult of child sized glasses cost about a buck each!  Now you can have the kid-lings over to watch their favorite movie in 3D without having to worry about having glasses destroyed.ONE THING MISSING: My only gripe is the set does not have a built in camera.  The LG AN-VC300 Skype Camera TV Webcam (AN-VC300) is, of course, available on Amazon and it doesn't cost *that* much.  Still, in this day and age many sets come already equipped with one.  That aside, I think this is a perfect TV and technology that will be relevant for several years.WHITE GLOVE DELIVERY: The Amazon delivery process included unpacking and setup.  I was pleasantly surprised that in this case the person making the delivery was quite familiar with this model and both willing and able to enter configuration setting, get the set on my home network, and do anything else to ensure it was fully operational before he left.EASY SETUP: I declined his offer to do anything beyond attaching the stand and setting the set on the stand I have been using for the past several weeks as I get to know what it can do.  Turns out all the stuff he offered to do was simple, quick, and painless.  (I wanted to see it for myself and that's part of why I declined his help.)  If you like fiddling, there are lots of things you can configure and everything can be stored in one of several profiles which can be recalled at the press of a button or two.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "One of the Best! w/***Crucial Update****", "Author": "Brice S.", "ReviewID": "R38X76RC2O1M7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Check the bottom for Crucial Update to this review.So I don't normally do this, but I am reviewing this product after just a day of usage. I'm really good about updating so I feel confident that if anything changes I will keep you guys posted.First off, this tv looks stunning even without the power on. The good news is, it looks just a beautiful with the power on. The 240hz paired with the Trumotion feature is outstanding. The apps work flawlessly and with plenty of speed. I've heard people say that they don't offer many apps and that is true, but the apps they do supply are mastered very well. Plus, all the apps that most people actually use are available (Netflix, Vudu, Hulu etc.)Also the internet browsing is pretty darn fast too. I also saw major complaints about the remote, but I have to admit I went into this tv already loving this feature because I am a Wii lover. One tiny complained about the Magic remote, it's a little fidgety. The remote is just a minor (very minor) problem. The remote works pretty well other than it can be a little jerky at times.The picture is amazing. The factory settings for this tv are great, I haven't had to change a thing(except I did put all my Trumotion settings to Extra Clear).Even without the 3d mode on it still looks like the images are dancing off the screen. The image control is very smooth and clear. It's literally like looking through a window. The sound is pretty good too. I was expecting to have to run out and get a sound bar but now I'm thinking I'll save the money, because the sound is very acceptable. The stand and the ultra thing tv look awesome.The 3d mode is pretty cool, especially the 2d to 3d function. I honestly don't care about 3d, but after playing around a bit with the 3d I am now pretty excited to have it.The apps and the wifi internet are very speedy and make for a very picture perfect viewing experience. I am a picture nut, so I need the apps to run at as close to blu-ray standard as possible, and this tv's apps passed with flying colors. The menus are a little sloppy but nothing that I'm sure a little extra time to conquer won't resolve.One cautious note of advice, I have read many concerned about bleeding a flashlighting and it is true. The good news is it does not seem to effect my viewing experience. I can only really notice it when the screen goes dark to set up the menu, but I played some dark movies and the bleeding was completely unnoticeable. I will keep this post updated if that changes though.With all that I've said I can't think of any good reason why this (in my case) tv should not deserve a well earned 5 stars. I got this tv because I recently had issues with my Samsung 6100 model tv, and boy am I glad I made the switch to LG. This tv delivers big time. If anyone has questions about this tv or any info on setting let me know.*****UPDATE*****I noticed a few reviews saying things like \"great, when you finally get a good one\". Since buying this tv I am now on my third 55LM7600. There seems to be some sort of packing issue, so not all people will be effected. The first two tv's had dead pixels (reaffirmed by LG sponsored Tech). The first one I bought had a small amount of bleeding and a small cluster of dead pixels that could not be revived. The second had zero bleeding but still a cluster of dead pixels. Finally the third one had no dead pixels and it was completely perfect. I got a keeper.The reason this update does not change my score is because its due to the technology. More and more tv's are getting slimmer and more sophisticated. You will likely find this issue with any tv. I am a realist when it comes to new technology. I understand that these tv's are fragile and you can't predict shipping malfunction. I do on the other hand think it may also have something to do with the packing.So with all that being said, I still stand firm on my rating. Even with the first two defective models (which were easy enough to take back and get one that did work) I would still put this tv head to head against any tv on the market. As long as you go into this buy with the idea that you may have to find one that was not damaged during delivery, you will be completely satisfied. This is not the first (or even second) time this has happen to me. I had a Sony Bravia show up one time with 6 dead pixels. No company is immune to delivery defects. Expect tv's to become more and more fragile as time moves on too. Rest assured though, you can always try again. After buying this tv and the first one having issues I was so convinced that this was a great tv I went right back up to the store and got the same model, and when it happened again I still didn't hesitate. Now on my third one I am truly happy I stuck to my guns. Being realistic on delivery issues is key.*******Update 2******I have found some settings that most represent what calibrators are looking for in good picture quality. You can find these on a certain website (lcdbuyingguide), where professionals have already taken the time to get your tv to the best picture quality. I've found that these setting work great in both a well-lit room and in a dark setting. This calibration gives you both the color and the contrast that I think are missing from the presettings (although the presettings are actually really, really good on this tv too).

You'll see as you go.Hope these help. Let me know if they do or don't.

I instantly regretted getting the 47 instead of opting for the 55\". More of a preference/experience thing than a actual TV issue. After the TV was set up (which was extremely easy BTW), the first thing I noticed is during black screens there was some bright spots and dim spots compared to my Samsung. Maybe Plasma really is that good. I will say this however, my new LG is noticeably better with image quality than my Samsung Plasma. I had them next to each other and my wife and I both preferred the image quality of the LG. Granted my Samsung is a 2010 model and the LG is a 2012, but that's all I have to go off of.The menu system of the LG was a little overwhelming at first, but after a hour I felt like the menu system was a lot better and a lot easier to navigate than my other TV.I love the SD conversion. SD channels look a lot better on the LG and HD channels are that much better.I'm a huge gamer so the first thing I did was hook up the PS3 and played a few 3D games. I kept getting info from friends stating that passive 3D isn't as good as active and active isn't even that good. So I was afraid to jump on the 3D bandwagon. I figured I'd get a 2012 model to get the best 3D tech possible. Well needless to say, the 3D is amazing. I cant agree with any of the comments of my friends. The 3D is stunning and a joy to watch.Basically I don't not regret the purchase of this TV. It's awesome and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good 3DTV, I don't have much to go off of, but I'd even go as far as to say this is the best 3DTV on the market.

LG customer support is expertly trained on telling you that you are STRAIGHT OUT OF LUCK with your defective television. In my case it is a bright white pixel in the right/middle of the screen. They will pretend like they care, they will send over a nice technician but when it comes to standing by their product they run to the bank laughing.My advice to you: Don't buy this TV, LG does not care about their customer and they don't care if they sell you a broken product. Now, if you fell in love with this TV and must have it no matter what a stranger on the internet says I strongly advise you to purchase this from a place that has a fair return policy when it comes to dead pixels.

Wish I'd gotten the 55\", and here's why:Note-pics uploaded too for what your tv should look like.ProsUPDATE- Backlight bleedings been a notable issue for many.  Upon inspection of my own set (bleeding isn't/wasn't a problem)I discovered that you can remove or create bleeding issues simply by pressing on the corners of the screen.  You may actually be able to work it out simply pressing in different areas of the screen.  Not just any area though its the edges where the light shines out the thin bezel.  Maybe you save the hassle of sending your tv back and you can enjoy the tv.  Use caution though you could make it worse...mines been great and messed it up, but was able to get it back.  I have quite a few pics of how balanced my backlight is.  Angling view makes a difference too read notes in pics.1. Picture quality-as close as you can get to perfection with LCD-LED. Enough options to meet almost anyone's expectations & then some. Almost forgot enough options to remove empty edge space by using zoom/stretch options.  No more annoying cinema black bars...as many know flash lighting is visible on black with nearly any LCD or LED/LCD display.  No black bars is a big plus for me none of the 4 tvs I have offer such options.  Some tv's remove a little, but none have matched what this TV does.  Viewing angle very good for LCD-LED too.2. Connectivity- 4 HDMI, 2USB+ apps USB, Component, Composite, Audio in, Audio optical out, RGB/PC, LAN & Wifi.  I've put all to the test no problems. Excellent picture quality using Sega, N64, PS2 in comparison to some other HD tv's in my house. Picture is quite an improvement despite such screen size and distortion that you'd expect.  Not found here.3. 3D quality is great for being passive, especially when using games that support 3D...haven't gotten into the movies.  My only problem is the weird effect it has after watching for very long.  Note hazard to younger persons as eyesight is in development and 3D could cause vision problems.  After watching I couldn't agree more with the warning. Using dual play split screen mode to play two players using 3D so that each has a full screen doesn't seem to be problematic though.  A lot better then having 2 big screens to play 2 player or having to cut split screen it.  Don't forget 6 pairs of 3D glasses included, doesn't need batteries and 50-100 pair of glasses, cheap & reliable compared to active.4.Sound is quite good for LCD-LED display.  Sometimes I feel like I am in the theater with sound & picture together, I feel I could put off getting added sound system for a while.  Considering wattage of the TV 57-87 watts total is about as good as it gets. This TV allowed me to replace the last tube TV a 13\" using 65watts, rotating my HDTV's in the house.  What more could I ask for all the bells & whistles, bigger screen using less energy.  Awesome!!!GAMING- great for games, by far the best for older games, not perfect, but better then other HDTV's read gaming notes in pictures. Also note motion remote works for PS3 almost like a move controller, as it takes use of the mouse/motion controlled tv remote, pause, play, select, scroll etc.  Unexpected feature it was.5.Design is sleek, slim, and up to date style.  Weight of it on the 47\" is manageable by one person at approx. 50lbs. However I would recommend 2 to carry it so as to not warp or bend the panel.  It feels very solid with what appears to be a very heavy duty aluminum frame so that you shouldn't have to worry. However as mentioned I didn't want to risk pressure pointing a spot to create back-light bleeding or flash lighting in different areas.  It is after all expensive and high-tech why risk it despite the quality I believe that it is.  TV's design should be relatively easy to keep clean.  Has a raised lip at bottom across the bottom of the screen, the top & sides however are flush.  TV does swivel slightly maybe 10-20 degrees.  TV thickness is slightly more then a permanent marker I pulled out.  I could barely tell, but upon closer inspection the bezel and edges were flatter then my permanent marker. Impressive!!6.Response- Despite what I thought, loading screens for smart-apps, features, and channels all switch very fast in comparison to any of my tv's of the past.  I was surprised channels switched faster then my smaller vizio, magnavox, samsung & toshiba tv's.  Apps & settings are quick also. I thought loading would be slow and if I wanted online I'd just use my PC anyways, but I'm quite pleased and can tell you if I had all the money to spend I still wouldn't bother upgrading except screen size to 55\".  I can wait 1-5 seconds for my stuff to load.  Can't forget the 240Hz refresh rate very good for gaming and fast action sequence.7. High channel count and organized contentAntennae, digital, HD & basic cable all organized.  I like that I can go to the digital and pick up all the HD content my cable provider has on my basic service.  My other tv's put HD content in between regular. So I'd go to channel 5, 5.1 HD, 6, 7, 8 then 8.1 HD...some reason this TV put the better quality channels together.  Also I'm not picking up channels with no picture or sound as a couple other tvs did and I had to manually remove other ones.  Menus are decent, but you can forget where that one setting was your looking for particularly with picture controls... nothing else is that bad.  Picture has to have like 30 options with 3D under like 5 subset menus or so.  Still great none the less.Neurtal & Cons if you can call them that1. Single biggest issue is the remote its futuristic and great, but a pain at the same time so I left it off pros, don't get me wrong I like it though.  No buttons for changing channels, no input buttons to switch to HDMI or other inputs... have to use arrows, motion mouse to get to inputs. Use scroll wheel like on a mouse to change channels, it is lightning fast at getting there, but somewhat annoying too.  HDMI and other inputs can notify you or ask if you'd like to switch upon TV detection of various devices.  The remote is awkward shaped like a banana but upside down when you set it down. Comfortable grip, just not crazy about the design.  Other annoying thing is you might be holding the remote waiting to change volume in some movies that you expect big sound changes, if you barely move it mouse comes on screen.  You can't sit with the remote on your lap/by your side and bump it the least bit or you got the mouse on screen.  Wish they'd release a update to make it to where you push a button to activate the mouse vs. motion sensing remote.  Accuracy/pin point is great and fun to use if your up to date with newer tech.  UPDATE-Discovered it really controls the PS3 as a motion controller not just stop/play etc.2. Picture quality perhaps only matched or beaten by tv's costing 1000's more, Plasmas cheaper, but life expectancy, quality degrade faster and use a lot more electric, or the new OLED TV technology which is superior, but ultra expensive to be released in upcoming weeks/months.3. TV design somewhat flawed, but manageable.  Raised lip at bottom don't like that it can collect dirt/glass cleaner..never liked the idea that it could get into the TV potentially...maybe I'm just paranoid about it though even if I spray it onto a cleaning cloth first.  Cable management...has cable management guides to fall behind contact points and conceal them, but ports are a stretch to loop around from side of bezel to go down and round to base.  It works, just a bit annoyed running my cables down and around, perhaps wall mounts would be better.4. No dual play glasses included, I just swapped 2 of my 6 pair glasses to get matching lens for 2 player dual play mode.  So I have 4 regular 3D glasses.5. Flash light effect/ viewing angle...can't compete entirely with plasma, but if your familiar with LCD technology I have to say its definitely the better one on the market.  In comparison to other LCD's its definitely up at the top for what it is.  Not sure any of this is a con to say the least, but if your looking to find something wrong these listed should be it.  Flash light effect- can't eliminate entirely as light source is needed to display colors, when mixed with black/shades of black it creates ghosting light/faded grays/blacks. I don't really think twice about how dark the blacks are when watching though. A couple brought it up as something they can't handle, can be various causes to diverse effects as well.  Others have taken pictures of issues, but I think it's due to warping/bending of frame, misguided/misplacement/ or bad light/s inside.  This tv I got has no unbalanced backlight so it is lit evenly across.  Some displays may have this issue worse then others. Viewing angle shouldn't be a problem either considering the size... I recommend trying to align your seating height with height of TV for best picture. Viewing under, over, too far from one side to the other, vs a more center direct view can be problematic on any lcd/led tv, colors change depending upon angle and seems to work against the 3D effect unless you use options to counter this as this TV has any option you need practically as mentioned. This set I probably wouldn't pass as an LCD/LED because of its quality in picture & viewing angle. If it weren't listed anywhere I'd ask if it were newer tech or plasma or something else.. its seemingly close to the tube TV viewing wise. This TV scores better then nearly all of this type on the market for viewing angle.  In comparison to my other tv's its a whole lot better.  I don't find it to be a problem viewing angle wise, but should be taken to consideration.SUMMARYOverall I couldn't be happier, just wish I'd gotten the 55\", I was concerned about picture distortion on bigger screen especially since my other smaller tv's performed poorly with 480p on cable/ games,etc.  This TV is remarkable with quality in that aspect, if your worried about it with games & such I don't feel that the 55\" would be a bad choice.  Other things lower costs on electric then my sm. 13\" tube, better life & energy efficiency then plasma.  More options & inputs then I need.  Good picture for standard definition 480p...excellent on 1080p of course.  Decent sound, thin design, light weight, fast response, great for gaming with the right cables...no delay.  Great price...paid 1300...12 days price dropped to 1049.  Contacted Amazon their price match guarantee gave me my 250 back.  PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND, WATCH FOR PRICE CHANGES FOR UP TO 14DAYS AFTER YOUR PURCHASE.  I just saved 250 by contacting them and notifying them about this...YOU DO HAVE TO CALL THEM THOUGH TO GET THE PRICE DIFFERENCE.  Truly the best bang for the buck.  Great sound for a TV, great 3D, cheap to get more 3D glasses if 6 pairs isn't enough.Picture, Sound, Style, Up-to-date, Price/value, efficiency, 3D, fast response, options & more options, all the inputs you could need, online & wifi...THIS TV IS THE ONE!!! :)  and one more thing you should anticipate some time as usual adjusting your settings.quick tip -skip basic backlight/color/brightness/contrast.  Go to eco mode disable for now, make sure 3D is off, skip down menu to advanced control and picture option.  Those will offer the most immediate options.  I did it backwards and achieved more optimal picture a lot faster after discovering these.  So I'd wasted my time going in order.

I've been playing around with picture settings for the past week. I've been able to make it less noticeable, but anytime there's a darker image on the screen you can see it. The local dimming settings don't seem to improve it at all. When watching letterbox movies it becomes very noticeable in the black bars. And when the screen goes to all black like between scenes in movies and TV shows, it's a mess and makes me sad.This is my first experience with an edge-lit LED TV, so maybe this flash-lighting is normal?! Given all the reviews I've read on different LED TVs, I'm starting to believe it is. If that's the case, I don't know how manufacturers can sell this technology. Hopefully, I just got a defective one.Physically, the TV is beautiful. It's very thin, with a solid stainless steel band around the edges. It is a sheet of glass from edge to edge except for a 1\" high bezel at the bottom. The glass covers the 0.5\" bezel on the other three sides.The magic remote is good. Some people seem to be complaining about it, but I find it very easy to use after a couple days practice. It's similar to the Wii controllers, but seems even more precise than the Wii. The only thing I don't like about it is the design. It doesn't sit on a table very well. It's curved and meant to sit like a tripod but it's top heavy and falls over all the time unless you're deliberate about putting it down. It's a minor thing, but can be annoying.The Smart TV options are great, but what is up with \"LG Smart World\"? It's like a low budget app store with app icons designed by a 12-year old. They should just take it out until they can get some quality apps and professional design. I wish they had Amazon Instant Video, but maybe that will get added in a future update (say yes, LG).I think I would really like this TV if it weren't for the flash-lighting. I'm sending it back for a replacement, but it's on back order for a month!-- UPDATE 6/9/2012 --I received a replacement a couple weeks ago. The new one is much better. The flash-lighting issue is still there, but it is much less noticeable than the old one and much more even. The first TV was manufactured March 2012. This new one is dated April 2012. Maybe they worked out some issues in the manufacturing process.Also, the display settings out of the box were much better. I only had to turn off TruMotion and adjust backlight dimming and it looked good. The old one took me hours to get right.The new TV came with the latest software update (version 3.20.31), which is still the latest version as of today. The old one had an older software version that I upgraded the first day I had it.Overall, I'm much happier, but not ecstatic. For the price I paid, I expected near perfection and just didn't get there. I'll probably look to LED full array or plasma for my next TV. LED edge-lit technology just seems flawed to me.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "Michael J. Edelman", "ReviewID": "R1DS13XRYOTPYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first thought when the delivery men unloaded the box in my living room was OMG... this thing is huge. I mean, it's gigantic. Viewing one in a store showroom doesn't prepare you for what it looks like when you get it home. A 55\" TV isn't twice as big as a 27\" TV; it's FOUR times as big. And with that comes an entirely different kind of viewing experience. There's a saying (sometimes attributed to Stalin during WWII) to the effect that quantity has a quality all its own. I mention it because it occurred to me as soon as I turned this TV on. The last TV I bought was a 24\" flat screen LED Sharp. That was a huge step up from my old CRT TV, but this... it's like night and day. Compared to the old projection TVs, and even the flat screens and plasma TVs of a few years ago, this is like stepping into reality. Anything shot for TV in the last few years has a totally different look than you're used to. Between the higher resolution, the wider viewing area, and the enhanced contrast, it's almost like watching through a window. And if you're a sports fan... football on a really high-quality large screen TV is better than any seat in any stadium. And that's *before* you switch on the 3D effect.My first 3D test was an episode of PBS' NOVA on the Sun. The show featured high-resolution, multi-spectral images of solar activity from the NASA Solar Observer, and while the images were impressive enough viewed normally, switching on the synthetic 3D made them pop right off the screen. I tested this effect on other shows, and discovered it worked best with shows featured exaggerated perspectives, wide camera angles, and lots of movement. Cartoons still looked flat. Sports close ups, aerial images and nature shows were enhanced, though after the novelty wore off I preferred watching without the effect and the glasses. Even without the 3D effect turned on, the same sorts of images that gave the best 3D effects produced a very vivid, nearly-3D feel, particularly if you sat close enough so that the screen extended into you peripheral vision.After getting my fill of broadcast digital TV, I moved on to checking out the Internet streaming capabilities. Setting up my wireless link to my router was easy, except for the annoyance of the getting used to the Magic Remote- more on this later. After updating the TV's software (a procedure that took about 10 minutes) I logged in to my Netflix account (again, easy except for the remote). Streaming worked flawlessly, and image quality was, as with the best broadcast shows, breathtaking. I also tried using YouTube streaming, the web browser (it works, but a computer with a keyboard is much easier) and Facebook (ditto.) I was a bit disappointed to find that a lot of my favorite digital streaming services that I view with my Roku box weren't available on the LG. A check at Amazon's web site indicated that it should be possible to view Amazon Prime videos on an LG TV, and had a panel where you could input your TV's code, but there was nothing on the TV. No Pub-Dub, either, or any of the other channels I regularly visit with my Roku. Maybe a future software upgrade will include more channels. (It does have TED.)I played around a bit with the video and audio settings to see the range of control that was available. The power-saving mode is supposed to dim the screen to match your environment, but in practice I found that most settings dimmed it too much. With the room lights dimmed, anything but minimum mode made the screen too dark to use the 3D glasses and dimmer than I'd like for normal viewing. It really looked best with this function turned off entirely, but I ended up leaving it on minimum.You can't just drop a TV like this on your old TV stand. For one thing, it weighs 50 pounds. You need a solid stand that won't flex, and one that won't easily move, lest you see several thousand dollars worth of the latest technology come crashing to the floor. You also need to either tether it to the wall, mount it on a steel wall mount or get an integrated cabinet and TV stand. I chose the last route, purchasing a combined TV mount and media cabinet that was rated for TVs up to 120 pounds. Even so, it does move a bit.Connecting this set to the rest of my audio-visual gear was straightforward. There are four HDMI inputs- I only needed one, for my DVD player- several USB inputs, and several composite inputs for video and audio. There's an audio output, but it's an optical (S/PDIF) audio output. That's fine if you have a recent amplifier of receiver designed for optical inputs, but useless if, like me, your audio gear is from another era. I have an excellent 1980s vintage stereo system (NAD electronics, Music Hall CD, etc), and see no need to replace any of the components. But to run the TV audio through the stereo I'll need to add some sort of optical converter. That's another $20-25 for a cheap one, and $50-100 for a decent one.About that Magic Remote: In principle, it's a great idea. It contains (I assume) a 3-axis accelerometer chip, like a Wii. You just point and click. Would that it were that simple. Getting used to the sensitivity of the remote took a fair amount of practice, and using it to input WiFi and Netflix accounts  and passwords had me muttering less than complementary thoughts about the parentage of whomever designed it. In the center of the remote is a wheel that's also a push button, and it was entirely too easy to move the wheel while trying to push the button all the while holding that wobbly arrow curson on an on-screen target. Entering a channel number directly involves going to a menu, activating the on-screen numeric keyboard, and then (hopefully) clicking on all the numbers correctly. Another annoyance is that the remote interface isn't consistent across all applications. I suspect I'm going to have to find a multi-function remote that works with this TV.So I'm not crazy about the remote, and I'm disappointed that I need to get an external optical audio converter and that only one of my favorite streaming video services is available. But I can get another remote, I can easily connect my Roku box, and an external converter isn't *that* expensive. And let's not forget that the video quality is indeed breathtaking with the right source. Despite the various flaws I mentioned, I'm still really impressed with this TV.Update: After about a month, I suddenly started getting an error message when trying to stream Netflix. I thought this was a Netflix error, but all my other devices worked fine with Netflix on my local WiFi network. A web search suggested that this was a common problem that started occurring with a particular TV software update, and that it could be fixed by resetting the Netflix application. This can be done by going  to the Home menu, and then to Settings -> OPTION ->Smart TV Settings, hitting RESET , and selecting Netflix. Note that once in the OPTIONS menu you have to scroll down to find the Smart TV Settings menu item; this had me puzzled at first. Hopefully LG will fix this in a future software update.Update II: Still love the TV, but I notice that I never use the 3D option. Unless you're actually watching a 3D DVD- and there aren't all that many out there, let alone ones worth watching- it's just an annoyance. The polarized glasses cut the brightness significantly, too. I've tried Sony 3D TVs, which use an (expensive) active google system, and it's somewhat better, but it's still mostly a gimmick.Update III (3 months): A few days ago I had to reset Netflix twice to get it to stream properly. As before, I checked my Netflix account on my iPad and PC to make there was nothing wrong. Then a day later, a message informed me that I had to upgrade my software to use Netflix. I started the update process, but it froze after reaching 99% downloaded. I restarted it a few times, but even after 8 hours the download was still stuck at 99%. After contacting LG support via eMail, I tried a different track: I reset the TV to  as-delivered configuration, erasing all settings, channels, and previous updates, and ran the software update from that state. That did the trick.One year update:The TV is still working perfectly and still delivering a knockout picture. Software updates are regularly downloaded without incident. There has, however, been one annoyance with the YouTube player. The sound goes out around 5 minutes into the video, then the picture freezes, and then the TV freezes. It won't respond to the BACK button or the HOME button. The only solution is to turn it off, after which it takes several pushes on the power button to start it again. Very curious. Googling reveals that a large number of LG owners have experienced this, and none has yet found a fix. LG doesn't seem to have a solution.Update 2:During a recent software update LG added Amazon TV to the apps on this TV, a most welcome addition. Now I can access my Prime subscription as well as a huge library of paid movies and TV shows without going through the hassle of switching over to my Roku box.

I viewed the TV at Best Buy and they were actually willing to match the Amazon price and fulfill my need for instant gratification :)I upgraded from a Samsung 50\" 720p Plasma TV (pretty bare bones) and right off the bat the thing that stood out about the LG was how thin it was, how little bezel there was on the edges, and how bright and beautiful the picture was. On my plasma I got a great picture, but there's something about LED/LCD that just looks better to me (colors just tend to pop due the back-lighting I think).I tinkered with the settings on the TV to get everything exactly the way I wanted it (which took some time and lot of internet research) but finally came up with a setting that I'm really happy with for almost all types of video - more on this at the bottom.Ever since I've gotten this TV, I've been absolutely blown away by the number of features it has. Some I didn't even realize it had until I stumbled upon it or through research about the TV after I bought it. Some of these great features are as follows:a. It hooks up to my wireless network effortlessly and is able to access media on my laptop. Basically my laptop is treated as a separate input and I can view pictures, stream video, etc - straight from my PC. It also has no problem streaming the video in HD quality. So any blu rays you've downloaded onto your PC, can be easily streamed to the TV in HD quality.b. It has USB ports and will read video files straight off the USB. My brother brought over a movie on USB stick in MKV format and he figured we would have to transfer it to the computer first. But nope - I plugged the drive straight into the TV and VOILA.c. I was able to download an app on my Samsung GS3 to perform all the functions that the magic remote that came with the TV does. This is pretty cool and handy. Now I don't have to have the magic remote out on the coffee table all the time in addition to my cable box remote. I can just use my phone when I need to use the magic remote functionality.d. The music player on my phone ports to the TV automatically. This is so easy that I actually did it accidentally. I happened to be sitting in my family room one day playing with the music player on my phone. I pushed a button that looked like a TV not knowing with it did and BAM - the music player showed up on my TV and the music started playing through my Harmon Kardon surround sound system. This was so cool and the fact that I had to do virtually nothing to set it up was a plus.I could go on and on about the good things about this TV as it truly is great. There is however one fairly big drawback that has been mentioned in countless other reviews and that's the light bleeding through on the edges of the screen. Honestly this isn't a big issue for me but it is noticeable - especially when viewing movies that don't take up the whole screen (i.e. black bars at the bottom and top) and if you're viewing these videos in a completely dark room. I've never noticed the edge bleed when viewing something that takes up the whole screen. So if you're someone who has a lot of letterbox movies and likes to watch them in the dark - I would NOT recommend this television. In that instance, you're probably better off going with a plasma. But for anyone else, this television comes highly recommended. Note that I set the LED Local Dimming setting to \"medium\" which seems to help with the issue.The 3D also looks pretty amazing. This was somewhat of an afterthought for me but I did purchase Tangled on 3D blu-ray and it looks completely stunning. Everyone that has seen it over my house has been blown away by the depth of the 3D and the clarity/beauty of the picture.Here are the settings I use for general viewing.

I also plan on updating this review down the road.I picked this TV because my kids wanted a 3D TV and the idea of messing with active glasses when my kids can hardly keep from breaking their own toys scared me.  After a lot of research I chose the LG.  I have owned 1 plasma, 5 LCD and a couple of front projection systems.  The Picture quality on this model is fantastic.  After a bit of calibration, I was very happy.  It produces a very natural image.  Black level is not as good as my plasma, but it if better than my LCD TVs. The Smart remote is worthless, but not a deal breaker.  3D is amazing.  We ended up watching a few 3D movies I picked up on Blu-Ray, and I was very pleased.  Everything about the TV was fantastic with one BIG problem.Flash-lighting.  I knew some people experienced this problem.  I have owned a few LED computer monitors, and was aware of what flash-lighting looked liked.  On my current monitor it is not noticeable during normal usage, and even when it is completely dark it is not so bad that it bothers me.  On every corner of this tv the light bleeds out from 4 to 10 inches into the image.  The upper left corner is the worst, and even with every setting turned down you can see it.  Not just in dark moments, but even well lit scenes it is there.  When you put it in game mode it is a nightmare because you can not put on local dimming which helps reduce the flash-lighting.It is so bad I am returning it to amazon for a replacement.  Thank god for amazon, because they are making the return very easy. It pains me to return it because it really is a great tv, but I could not stand it anymore.  When I get the replacement I will update on if there was an improvement.UPDATE: I have the replacement.  After spending an hour with it I am happy to say that I can not find any flash-lighting on the replacement.  If you experience edge bleeding seek a replacement asap.  This is an obvious quality control issue on LG's part.  Outside my initial problem with the TV, everything else in my review still holds.  It produces a very good image, and fantastic 3D.

There was a period of time when I tried living tv free, but I find myself watching these days so might as well get something decent to watch. I spent a lot of time reading endless reviews about LG, Samsung and Panasonic televisions. I am quite an electronics buff so it matters to me to buy something with longevity. I was willing to buy top of the line (Samsung 8000 series, Panasonic LC-WT50) if the tv appeared worth the money. Here are my thoughts:(1) The market is going to transition to OLED, starting in the next two months and taking approximately 2-3 years to reach general consumers. That will be a large improvement.(2) Lots of people like plasma but I wanted a tv versatile enough for different room lighting conditions so I restricted to LED. I also view plasma as a dated technology though the Panasonic high end plasma tv's have excellent reviews (the worries are buzzing, heat output, thicker units and old issues like burn. Some of these issues are not serious problems these days). I just decided against plasma so I can't add anything more useful there.(3) The Samsung 8 series has a number of unfavorable reviews. The price point is much higher than the LG 7 series and one must use active 3D. The Panasonic WT series has one spectacular review (hdguru.com) which looks anomalous. Every other reviewer has not been particularly impressed. In fact the DT series (one lower and not stocked by Amazon itself) might be a better tv. Again one has to deal with a higher price point as well as active 3D and no included 3D glasses in the Panasonic.With these points in mind, I decided I would be happy trying the LG7600 and I ordered the 47\" which is at an excellent price. I could imagine it going into the bedroom eventually if I got an OLED a year or two down the line. The 47\" are shipped by UPS (when sold directly by Amazon) because they are not viewed as a large item. The tv arrived and the day image is absolutely gorgeous. The tv itself is gorgeous. No question. It is svelte and quite beautiful.Note: I had to upgrade the firmware to the latest version (there is an option under \"settings\") which meant it was from an older batch. Connecting to my wireless network was simple. The magic mouse controller is not the best but completely useable. My standard cable (RCN) remote took a minute to set up with LG (which is a preset on my Tivo). That will be the primary remote.The 3D is really quite stunning and with 6 pairs of passive glasses, it's easy to watch with friends. The whales documentary is quite spectacular for the most part. It's streaming so when the data rate drops, the image goes \"fuzzy\" which can give you a headache. Playing off a blu-ray (which I haven't done yet) will probably give a stunning image. I didn't buy this tv for the 3D but it's much better than I expected.The main problem appeared at night with darker images. The upper left (and to a lesser extent the upper right) corners had a serious light bleeding/flash lighting issue. I mean bad enough that everyone who came by noticed it. It basically looks like a manufacturing defect to me. That was a deal breaker. I think Amazon is aware of the problem because they wouldn't guarantee a replacement at that time. The only option was a return.So I waited and saw that the LG models had gone out of stock and were restocked. Guessing there had been a refresh, I decided to give them one more try. This time I ordered the 55\". I highly recommend the large tv if you can afford the price difference. It gives a more cinematic experience. My room is not big: I have about 102 inches between the tv and my sofa, which is fine for viewing a tv of this size. Amazon subcontracts to a local company to deliver and set up the tv, which is a big plus. Particularly if you need to return the tv. Anything smaller is delivered by UPS and you get to set it up. The tv arrived yesterday. First, the software is up to date. That suggests this is from a new batch. Even better, I have not noticed any flashlight/bleeding issues on this set. You can see the edge lighting when you power up, but I don't see anything problematic in images. I suspect LG has tweaked their manufacturing process to correct that defect.The settings out of the box are also better than the earlier 47\". The backlight is brighter. Reducing the trumotion setting (for me to 2,2) gets rid of the soap opera effect. The picture looks really good to me. I am now willing to strongly recommend this tv. The screen is very glossy and reflects the furniture in my room but I don't think it's a serious issue. I haven't played with the apps much yet. The viewing angle range is perfectly good for regular television. For 3D, it's a much tighter range. This is again not a serious issue. The sound is perfectly good. I'll modify my review if any issues arise in the next two weeks but right now, I am very happy with this purchase.UPDATE 9/7/12: there was a new firmware update which I installed. I can't see what has changed so I assume it involves apps or settings I haven't used. The image is still gorgeous. My strong buy recommendation is even more strongly reinforced after watching hours of television, including the the Presidential conventions, tennis, movies and some American football.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product with few significant flaws", "Author": "Krish", "ReviewID": "R2ZCKG8VEBZA0F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought this TV couple of months ago. I am a techy so I normally use my gadgets to the fullest extent. Here is my review.The biggest issue I face is the screen reflection. The TV comes with a glossy screen and it is extremely reflective. I think this is a big time deal breaker for me. If you are like me and you love sunlight and bright lighting in your living room, this TV is not for you. Even with very small, not so bright lamp just across the room, the video is just not visible. We had to rearrange our living room furniture to avoid glare! If I had known about this issue I wouldn't have bought it.Picture Quality: I would say this is definitely a very strong attribute for this TV. Video quality is excellent. The contrast, color balance, uniformity, black levels all are top notch.Remote: The magic motion remote is OK but not great. Even simpler things take three four clicks (yes this TV has a remote and the magic motion has a gyroscope that works like Wii Remote). For example if you want to change from HDMI 1 to HDMI 2, you will have to select Home, select input list and then click on input type. In my earlier TV which was a first generation LG LCD all you have to do is to press the Input selector and it cycles through the different input types. This to me is the most annoying part. If you have a cable box, a ps3 and Wii then this gets too old too fast.Smart Apps: All the smart applications work as advertised. Coolest thing is if you are like me who has lot of downloaded content in your PC, this TV comes with built-in Wifi and is DLNA certified. So you can actually stream wirelessly almost all video content (It supports avi, mpg files and rest you will have to convert) to the TV.Sound: For such a slim TV it has a surprisingly loud speakers. If you are not an audio aficionado you can probably get by with just the inbuilt speakers. One quirky thing is that if you connect this TV to an optical output (Home Theater or a Receiver) it doesn't automatically mute the TV speakers. You will have to manually mute the TV lest you will end up hearing echo.Overall if the screen is not this much glaring/reflective, I would definitely recommend it. It is great value for the money with all the features.

I originally wanted the 55LM8600 I am really glad that I saved the dough and what a bargin I got too!  when I was searching for the 8600 I found a place in NJ called East Coast TV's not too far from me in Linden.  The TV was 4 hundred dollars cheaper than anywhere I called directly and they told me they usually only ship but if I wanted to come pick up the TV I could but I would have to pay cash or in the terms of the person on the phone \"Dead Presidents on Green Bills\"  I thought that was funny at first but the more I thought about it the more shady it seemed.  So I slept on it.  I then did more reviews and the TV just didn't seem worth it so I looked at the 7600.  On East Coasts website along with three others the TV was 1288.99. I did a google search on East Coast TV's and saw they were on some warehouse street in Linden NJ no store front or anything...Hence the reason for the back ally cash transactions.I saw more and more poor reviews for all the sellers that had the TV at this price. I went to a best buy near my job at lunch today and asked about their price matching the guy wouldn't do it.  after work I went to PC Richard.  The sales guy didn't have them in stock and wanted to help me pick another tv he even told me the LM8600 was discontinued but the 7600 was not.  Not sure if thats true but its possible the tv's reviews weren't amazing.  The more I read about the 7600 hundred the more I wanted this TV.Everyone is going to post bad reviews for every 1 good review there are probably five bad ones.The  PC Richards Sales guy wouldn't let me leave so while he got on the phone to find out if he could ship the TV to the store from another location I quietly walked around the store and made my way to the front then slipped out.I then went to a best buy near my house on the way home from work and had a completely different experience.The sales guy was awesome he price matched the 1288.99 price for me and was totally cool I know Best Buy guys don't make commission but I wish this guy did he was friendly and awesome I didn't need to know much about the TV because of all the research I did but I am sure he would have helped.Now for the technical side of the review:The TV is a true 5 star tv for the price.  Most of the reviews I saw state that there are white spots on the corners of the screens and its true there are but just set the local dimming and the black levels will pop.  Its got the deepest blacks I've seen on any tv for the same price.  The 3D is Phenomenal make sure you find a Site that has proper calibration for 2D and 3D settings.  Out of the box the tv looked great but once I calibrated it it was 1 thousand times better.I love amazon. I love some of their prices this review in no way knocks them or should deter you from buying a TV from them or any other product...I just ordered some Dual Play Glasses to go with the TV from here can't wait to get them. and would have bought the tv here if I wasn't jonesing for instant gratification. I had been researching for almost a month.  Right now its actually cheaper here then where I bought it after tax and I'm a prime member so I probably could have had it in a day.The price when I originally looked at this TV was about two hundred dollars higher here.I have 2 LCD samsungs both about 8 years old one 46 and one 40 and they are great TV's but I felt it was time for an upgrade and this was a beautiful upgrade When I first started looking at 3D tv's I was thinking more along the lines of Active 3D but after getting this in the house and properly calibrating both the 2D and 3D settings and the 3D up conversion from 2D this TV is hands down the best I have seen in this price range.I am an LG convert for sure", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "A fantastic TV for the future", "Author": "arizonaames", "ReviewID": "RN48STIQ9KRNB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this review to better inform the potential buyer. I have read many poor reviews for this LG 55\"lm7600 TV and also some that were very good but still, I had lingering doubts. I am the kind of guy that thinks that a glass is half empty and I had to see for myself. I was going to purchase the TV through Amazon but because of some of the bad reviews, I wanted to purchase the TV locally so that it could be returned more easily.Did I have problems? At first, yes. The dreaded edge bleed was there but not severe enough to matter. There was some bleed in the upper left corner and right bottom corner but not a lot. There was also some bleed across the top of the screen at night with a black background but, again, not a big problem and the bleed was acceptable knowing that this was an edge lit TV and you were going to get a bit but it in no way inteferred with viewing even with a very dark or black screen.I had difficulty streaming some of the net blogs like anything that was NBC (voice out of sync and pixilated faces), TVLand, or anything that required windows silverlight. This is a linux operating system and does not support microsoft or its' products. Also, the Adobe flash is fixed at 11.0 and one cannot update it now or in the future. There is no upgrade to change that as yet or are there any plans to do so. The Linux operating system is very complicated and due to this chances of a bug or virus is very very rare.I also had difficulty maintaining settings when I went to inputs and clicked on a nonexistant input. It would erase my settings and I had to start over again. With devices plugged in and going to those devices and swiching back to other devices that were also plugged in or going back to home, the settings would remain in place.Now for the unvarnished, half glass facts. This TV is incredible. The picture quality is better than any....any....other TV out there. The blacks are as good as  any plasma and the whites, yellows, gold, wood, and greenery is incredible as well. the settings are as follows....backlight-70, contrast-50, brightness-60, sharpness-25, color-43, tint-G2 energy setting off.The 3D is out of this world and if you subscribe to Netflix or Hulu Plus, you will get 1080p videos and the 2D to 3D conversion is incredible. You can upload and watch your pix from your puter or other device. The accuweather is very basic and you will be lucky to get weather 100 miles from you. Crakle is great and free and that is also an App.You will have questions and problems as this is a complicated piece of equipment to operate. LG cutomer service is better than excellent. There are times when you might have to call a few times to get a more knowledgeable tech but thay are all polite and patient....even the one that I cussed out only to find out that they were right and I was wrong.Overall, you will be very pleased with this TV. Yes, it is not perfect. Can it be with all that it does? I do not think so but more than 80% of the problems are with the operator. Updates will come but this TV is light years ahead of any other 3D Smart TV out there and did I mention the light Passive Glasses that makes Active 3D TVs look like a 2D to 3D conversion on this LG 3D Passive TV. It is truly incredible but will take days for a new buyer to understand it. It is not a turn on and watch TV but it is a TV that you will be hard pressed to stop watching once it is set up.This just in: LG just cam out with a new app that turns your smart phone into a TV remote. Now you can use your smart phone remote instead of the Wii that some folks complain about. LG is fabulous and this TV after 2 months is the best investment I ever made.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!", "Author": "pworam", "ReviewID": "RATW4MQS2KMI1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very impressed with this set.  I have a 40 inch Sony Bravia that I love but wanted something bigger and with 3D.  This TV does not disappoint in either regard.  The picture quality is fantastic - be prepared to do some tweaking though to get it directly to your specific tastes.  Fortunately, the TV comes with a robust number of picture adjustments and settings for dialing it in just right.  The sharpness, color saturation and black levels are remarkable.  Just keep in mind garbage in, garbage out; this TV LOVES a good quality HD signal.  As hopefully most of us know, content format and broadcast quality are critical in normal tv viewing.  This TV will thrive with a quality signal, but will quickly let you know when you're viewing substandard content and signal quality, as it's in a large screen class which tend to amplify these imperfections.The wand remote is cool - not necessary, but cool, and smart app functionality is alright.  While perfectly acceptable, the one draw back of the remote is that you have to enter a menu before hitting input and setting options; a typical remote provides one-button access to these functions.  Also, it's kind of tough navigating the remote in the dark, and if you accidentally knock it while it's pointed at the screen the cursor will hover for a few seconds.  I've noticed the menu system can be a bit laggy and can sometimes take a few seconds to pop up.  The built in WIFI is actually very good, and handles most streams very well.  Don't expect it to take large HD movie files without some hiccups though -  this is to be expected with wifi in general (it's fine for streaming tv shows and movie files up to about 2gb).One surprise in this set was the sound.  This thing is surprisingly loud.  I was debating a soundbar and sub, but can't really justify the added expense.  The only drawback of the system sound I don't care for is that the user setting, which gives you access to a 5 band graphic EQ, doesn't allow for virtual sound.The 3D is astonishing, especially the 2D-3D conversion that the TV is capable of.  It's better on some material than on others, but the clarity and depth it brings to the viewing experience need to be tried to be believed - it's like looking through a window.  I've been using the 3D on more often than not.  With true 3D source material, images pop off the screen - I have to admit I've tried grabbing at stuff and actually ducked a few times.  The included glasses, while not particularly sturdy, work well and are very non-intrusive (you'll quickly forget you're wearing them).  What's nice is the ample amount that LG throws in - 6 pairs.  Another plus of the passive 3D is the wide viewing angle. I haven't noticed any artifacts, although I have at points noticed very minor ghosting at spots on the screen set at a steep vertical viewing angle from my perspective; tweaking the 3D settings eliminates it entirely.While I did note the flashlighting (I was looking for it based on other comments), it isn't terrible and does not detract from the overall picture at all.  My back lit Bravia LCD would also show some nominal brightness around the corners and middle edges at the top and bottom of the screen.  Most of the time it isn't even noticable.  I personally prefer a brighter, slightly cooler picture, and surprisingly, I don't have any serious issues with the flashlighting.  Properly adjusting the backlight, brightness, contrast and gamma can remove it almost entirely.  I actually like using the Dynamic constrast as well, since to my eye it improves black levels and white brightness with out washing out color and detail.  The edge lights are going to be noticable to one degree or another, especially if you really look for them, but it's inherent to the edge-lit design; keep in mind this is a BIG screen, so some imperfections should be expected at various off-axis viewing angles.  If you can't live with, don't buy an edge-lit tv.  Also, I would recommend having a few different settings under each input for different viewing circumstances to allow minimizing the flashlight affect should you notice it.  EXPERIMENTATION IS YOUR FRIEND!People beefing about the TV not actually being \"true\" 240Hz need to have their heads examined.  HDTV's only take 60Hz input signals anyway - the 60/120/240Hz actually pertains to internal image rendering and processing within the TV itself.  You can't truly notice any difference over 120Hz anyway, so it's tough to nitpick the refresh rate.  I've tried using the game screen setting, but I have two other custom setting that I prefer for gaming.  I haven't experienced any latency issues at all gaming on either a PS3 or Wii-U.All things considered this is a great set by any measure.  I can live with the relatively minor shortcomings I've noticed.  For 3D, I would not go the active route and am happy that I rolled the dice on the passive technology.  Also, the picture quality is great.  As several reviewers have pointed out, all current HDTV technologies have their own particular drawbacks.  I decided not to go with a Panasonic primarily because I wanted the passive 3D, better efficiency and less screen heat.  Also, I didn't want to have to worry about potential burn in, and prefer what I find to be the \"smoother\" (for lack of a better term - I guess \"sexier\" could work too) picture LCD technology provides.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "A smart choice for many reasons", "Author": "Brent Butler", "ReviewID": "R1Y1SY0QG8FECK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited a few weeks after purchasing this TV to write a review, because I had read of a few other owners reporting problems with the model. I wanted to give my unit a chance to exhibit any of these issues before writing my review.So let's talk about the potential issues first:1. Light bleeding. On the user submitted images you'll see some with a dark screen and white circles around the edges. The is supposed light bleeding which might effect the image as you view programming. I have those light circles on my model ... when I first turn it on and the screen is completely dark. Once programming starts to play, there is no noticeable effect of the picture.2. Hardware going bad soon after purchase. Didn't happen with mine. We've been using it now for about two months without a single issue.3. Dead pixels. Hasn't happened here.4. Problems with the image during motion. The only issue I've had regarding this is something like a football in motion on a live 3D broadcast. We haven't noticed any problem like this when watching normal TV programming or movies, either 2D or 3D.5. Magic Remote. This is the only area that I sort of agree with complaints, although I wouldn't say I have a complaint here. I really only used it extensively for settings, as everything else I do is pretty much controlled thru other devices. So in normal use I turn this TV on or off, and that happens with my universal remote. So I'm not at home moving the cursor around with the Magic Remote, and I never will be. There is a minor irritation in that any movement of the remote causes the cursor to appear on the TV. So if it gets jostled I have to pick it up and push a button to get rid of the cursor. This is a quibble that really should have no bearing on anyone's decision between this TV and a different one.In short, everything reported by the one star reviewers ... and I read them all before deciding on this model ... didn't happen with our set.Now let's talk about what I like:1. We've had a Sony rear projection 57\" 1080i set for about 10 years. Moving to the picture on this set seems to be as much of a positive step as moving to HD in the first place with that Sony. The picture on this set is truly spectacular. It is brighter, with richer colors, and the details show up better even when the image source isn't 1080p.2. Passive 3D. I did a lot of research on this before deciding on Passive vs. Active 3D. In the end, we hardly every \"just watch TV\" (or even a movie). Both my wife and I have our computers right by our easy chairs in our den. I'm often working or doing light research while watching TV or a movie or a sporting event. Using the passive 3D glasses means that I can look away from the screen and do other things without taking them off. So that's the route I took. The glasses are less expensive than the Active glasses, and we are quite happy with the 3D effect we get from this set.3. Wifi. The built in Wifi connected easily to my network, and has no trouble finding all the pictures, videos, and music that I have shared through the media server.4. While a couple of people seemed to find the Setup menus confusing, I had no problem with them. There are \"macro\" settings for image display options. However, you can also select an incredible amount of detail for how your picture is displayed. I did some research online and found some \"TV Experts\" with this set who have published their lists of detailed settings for this model. Using those as a guideline, I replicated their setting on this unit, and am very impressed with the result.5. The physical set up was quite easy. The TV isn't too heavy for me to handle by myself. I simply propped it up, put the stand together, screwed the stand onto the TV, and carried it to its permanent home in our den. It was an easy process and only took me a few minutes.I'll sum it up:We've experienced no problems whatsoever to give me any concerns about having bought this 55\" 7600. What I bought it for ... 3D and a better picture ... it delivers, and at a level far beyond my expectations prior to purchase.Highly recommended.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely the best TV for the price!!", "Author": "Todd Walker", "ReviewID": "R2DMBU0ONKND0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely the best TV for the price!! I've been looking a long time for a TV and decided on LG for 3 main reasons: Price, Picture, and Passive 3D. I bought my parents the LG 47LW5600 for $900.00 on 12/12/11 which is an excellent TV and my friend has the 47LW5700 also very good, (the 5600 is better between the two), but this TV is a big improvement over the 2011 models. The glossy screen doesn't reflect as bad as you think and it does seem to help the image \"pop\" more. The TV is a work of art, and the stand looks cool too (which swivels), I thought I would hate the motion remote but I got so used to it that when I used my friend's regular remote it seemed slow going through the menus, (only wish it had dedicated input and exit buttons). You have a lot of control over the picture quality (each of the standard settings give you access to different options) and over all I found it best to have real cinema ON, and TruMotion on 3 Smooth. There's no blur at all and the black levels are pro, I play COD MW3 on PS3 and there's NO Input LAG (you have to use \"Game Mode\" setting) which you can tweak safely without creating LAG, I have it looking UNBELIEVABLE!!! I also have it on HDMI input 1 (seems to work the best). To summarize I bought the LG 47LM7600 on Amazon New for $1,050.00 (no tax, free shipping) on 05/28/12, the picture is UNREAL, the passive 3D is excellent, and gaming is great (must be in \"Game Mode\") also it's nice that it comes with 6 pairs of 3D glasses, and shipping was ridiculously fast.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too many 5 star reviews, do more research", "Author": "Alexander Reeser \"vilago\"", "ReviewID": "R1XGAMPVA2NUK4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you only take one thing away from this review, it should be that the 5 star reviews and top selling nature of this TV on amazon are epidemic. It seems that once a few people give 5 star reviews, the result is that an item will sell faster irrespective of anything else. And the problem is that most of the reviews are probably from people who don't care or notice the difference from one HDTV to another apart from the fact that one has a larger screen. My advice to you is to be sure you are looking at every model and type of TV (plasma, LCD, etc.) available from ALL the manufacturers and base your decision on professional online reviews (CNET etc.) and use amazon reviews as a tertiary source! ESPECIALLY, if you are the type of \"picky\" individual (like me) who likes to have \"the best\".Anyway, now that that's out of the way let me begin by saying that I did buy this tv, went through two panels, then decided to go with the Panasonic VIERA TC-P55VT50 55-Inch 1080p Full HD 3D Plasma TV. I don't regret the decision, but let me just say that there is no such thing as a perfect flat panel tv, LCD/LED, plasma or otherwise. If you understand that fact, you'll be A LOT happier going in, and down the road.First, one of the main reasons I returned this TV is that the \"flashlighting\" issues were absolutely horrible. At first I only noticed the backlight bleed when watching letterbox or cinema widescreen when the black bars are at the top and bottom. Eventually I started to notice the backlight bleed even during full screen content during dark scenes. While it was practically invisible during the day, at night it was all I could look at. I then got a replacement panel figuring it wouldn't be as bad, and the problem was still exactly the same, no change. It is probably the design of the panel, because on both models I noticed the majority of bleed on the left top corner of the screen and also some on the bottom left. If this were the only problem with the set then I might have just kept it but read on.Secondly, the DSE or \"dirty screen effect\" is equally (or worse depending on content) horrible to the flashlighting. Just watch any bright scene where the sky or some other light color is in the background and the camera pans around and you'll notice a lot of dirty vertical streaks all across the entire panel.There was an issue where, if you used the LG a lot without turning it off it would just randomly turn off then back on. Sometimes it would lose sound completely unless I turned it off and back on. This technical glitch is something that occurred enough to be annoying and I thought it wouldn't happen on the replacement TV but it did. It was very distracting especially during a full length movie. Even my significant other was bothered by this issue which says a lot!Finally, during fast motion, if the trumotion feature was enabled, I could see a lot of artifacting around the moving object. The decrease in motion blur or studder is not worth the additional artifacting IMO.These issues ruined my experience with this TV and caused me to look around at what else might be better quality or at least less distracting than the LG (within reasonable price) and long story short I decided to go with the panasonic plasma.You've heard the CONS but here's a summary of the good points of the LG for me, 1 star each:Pros+The 3D experience on this TV is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! and it's true, sole, saving grace. If you watch 3D content exclusevly or at least 50% of the time, then you'll probably be perfectly satisfied with this TV. The LG passive 3D is the future of home viewing: the glasses are light, unobtrusive, undistracting, inexpensive and universally compatible, not to mention almost 100% free of any distracting \"cross talk\" or artifacts that I can see. That being said, there's not much in the way of 3D content right now apart from gimmicks so I don't base my purchase on 3D (yet).+The Wii-like remote of this TV is the best \"gimmicky\" remote on the market and is actually worth having. I really do miss it, since the panasonic and samsung touch remotes are just garbage in comparison, you won't use them. The LG remote isn't perfect: the scroll wheel is useless, there isn't an input button and the remote pointer is too easy to activate accidentally.I won't review the panny here but I'll summarize what I've learned from hours of research about plasmas:Plasma:Pros+color accuracy, blacks and contrast are top notch especially for the price. Colors just have unbeatble depth and are very accurate. I don't want to take too much time here, but just know that black levels aren't only for black reproduction, but also is a very good indicator of contrast or the difference between true white and true black. Plasmas will beat just about anything out there in black level, contrast and color reproduction as a package deal.+screen uniformity. raise an eyebrow at anyone that says their TV has \"perfect screen uniformity\" they are lying. while the VT50 exhibited some DSE, it was maybe a 1 or 2 on the distractibility scale where the LG was a 7 or 8 in that department. Some will say DSE comes from uneven application of the antireflective filter, but in my experience DSE comes from groups of pixels in the display not glowing to equal brightness compared to the surrounding pixels. this effect is seemingly more visible if the brightness is set to a lower setting. If the brightness is set very high, all the pixels will apparently glow at the same brightness and the DSE effect seems to disappear, at least on my panny. I didn't test this on the LG, since the DSE was distracting no matter what setting I used. And no backlight bleeding!+no need for \"trumotion\", the refresh rate and motion of a plasma beats anything else on the market, hands down.+off-center viewing is unflappable. This is apparently one of the areas where the VT50 beat the overpriced sharp elite but I saw an elite in the magnolia center in my nearby best buy and while I noticed that the color and contrast deteriorated SLIGHTLY when off-center, it wasn't nearly as extreme as some of the comments made it out to be.CONS (in order of severity):-Anyone who tells you that image retention and/or burn-in (two different things! be sure to do your research!) is a non-issue on modern plasmas is, once again, lying. While at first I was naive and unconcerned, it didn't take long for me to find traces of IR on my VT50 in the first hours of its use. while some manufacturers are better than others at combating this and modern panels are apparently better equipped to handle it, there were some cases where the HUD in Mass effect 3 or the cartoon network logo was easily visible on a white or uniform colored slides. Once I first noticed the IR I panicked and started to obsess all over the internet for answers. Then over time I realized that it will eventually go away, it just takes quite a bit of time for the IR to go away. It takes a lot of negligence to become burn-in or permanent. As the IR image SLOWLY began to fade away, I relaxed and realized I was overreacting. While the IR and burn in of plasmas past seems to be less of an issue, I would not recommend a plasma to someone who games exclusively or has kids. I would reserve the plasma mostly for movies and people who do not have kids or can afford to have a TV exclusively for \"mommy and daddy\" time. You can minimize the chance of IR by using the zoom feature, but in a majority of cases it's impossible to zoom far enough in so that the problem image is out of the screen area.-line bleed. I don't think I would have noticed this if I hadn't read about it on the internet and now I can identify it pretty easily. Do a google search \"plasma line bleed\" and you can see there has been a lot of discussion on forums. Again, some manufacturers are better than others but this is pretty much an inherent issue of owning a plama.-buzzing. Don't get me started! While this is a non-issue and not even close to a con for me (yes I do actually notice the buzzing sometimes) some people seem to want to give the VT50 or other plasmas low scores for this one issue! If you want to hear an actual annoying sound while your TV is on, try my old Sony CRT tube television. That thing emits a loud, high pitched screech that can be heard two rooms away. I'd gladly trade the low hum of a plasma for the loud whistle of a CRT! It just goes to show how much bias there is for these amazon reviews.Closing remarks:While the image retention and line bleed are still issues associated with a plasma, I decided that they were less visible or at least less distracting less of the time compared to issues associated with equivalently priced LED backlit-LCD panels. Bonuses of the plasma in the color accuracy, contrast, black levels and all the things I mentioned make up for it's shortcomings in the long run. You could take the safe route and buy the LG but if you don't have kids or are looking for a very nice secondary TV take a serious look at the ST/GT/VT panasonic plasmas as well as the samsung line. For the price, even the \"king of LCD\" sharp elites can't match the overall performance of a plasma.Some interesting links:[...][...][...]I'll probably update this review if I forgot anything but please comment and let me know if you have any questions or just want to counter any of my statements.

However, I read great review about this awesome passive 3D LED TV in a Home Theater Magazine review and it sounded great and thought I needed to get one when my 8 year old 46\" LCD TV died.  However, I kept seeing this TV on display in a couple of local stores and the on sale prices looked good but the models on display were older ones --- must have been close out specials or something.  I then read numerous online reviews from Amazon and other websites which basically praised the capabilities of this TV.  So I decided to get a 55 inch 7600 right away but unfortunately Amazon could not ship the 55 inch to Hawaii --- I either had to buy the smaller 47\" one or buy from a different source.  So I bought the 55 inch locally a couple of weeks ago.I am sorta a techie who likes to have the best in electronic gadgets.  Being in Hawaii where we have the most expensive electricity in the USA, I wanted to get an energy efficient TV and originally thought I would have to get a smaller one --- my old top of the line 46 in drew almost 300 watts and emitted a lot of heat --- I wanted one that drew a lot less current,  this 55 inch LG 7600 draws only 160 watts and emits no noticeable heat.  I also wanted a passive 3D TV and from what I could determine this was the best one on the market.The stand is a neat design and looks great --- however, it holds the TV a bit less than 3 inches above the cabinet it sits on and the cable box is 3 1/2 + inches high .  It would really be nice if the stand held the TV at least an inch higher so the cable box could slide under part of the TV.  The stand was very easy to assemble and attach to the TV (one of the easiest I experienced).  Right out of the box, the TV worked well even though it took a bit longer than expected for the magic remote to sync with the TV.  The initial set up went very well and was very easy to understand/accomplish.  I found that the factory set energy mode produced a rather dim picture but after some tinkering, the minimum energy saving setting seemed to work best for me --- all the other factory settings produced great pictures.  I had read some place that the HDMI handshake had problems working with some HDMI switches but I did not have a problem using my old A/V receiver to switch between HDMI inputs.I suppose you will either love the magic remote or hate it --- I don't really care for it (yet), but I am getting used to it.  I still prefer the conventional remote.  The magic remote would be more useful if it had a button to go directly to the input selection.  The conversion of 2D to 3D works well but does not provide the depth that movies originally made in 3D have --- which is understandable and this feature is awesome.  From my experience with computers, I understand that the glossy screen provides a better image than a matte screen but the glossy screen does have bad reflections under certain lighting conditions.I would like to have seen more inputs --- I have 7 HDMIs (cable box / PS3 / DVD 5 disk player / DVR / ROKU / Apple TV / LG 3D Blueray) but I am able to make out by connecting 4 of the HDMIs to my old 7.1 A/V --- connecting the A/V; Apple TV; ROKU; LG 3D Blueray  to the 4 HDMI inputs. Also, it could use more of the composite inputs and component  inputs --- I use the only composite input to connect to the cable box to the TV for routine viewing (to save energy) and use the cable box's HDMI when watching movies and run the sound through the 7.1 A/V.  I have not had/noticed the flash lighting/clouding effect other reviewers mentioned.PROS-Price-Edge to Edge screen --- screen goes very near the edge of the TV.-Picture Quality-Low Electrical Consumption-2D to 3D Conversion --- decent-Original 3D Images --- quite stunning-Free 3D documentaries from LG are awesome-Inexpensive 3D Glasses (movie theater type)-Built in wifi --- update TV's firmware-Internet Capabilities-LG app for the iPhone-Internal Speakers produce decent sound-Stand allows TV to be turned slightly to either sideCONS-Number of Inputs-Labeling inputs is limited to pre-designated \"tags\"-Magic Remote (either love it of hate it)-Remote Needs an Input Button-Initial Logging into wifi --- difficult with magic remote-Rental Price of the 3D Movies available from LG are rather high-Confusing Procedures for signing up to purchase items from LG-Limited Availability of 3D Movies --- Amazon appears to have best selection but even that is very limited --- need to get the old classics (House of Wax, War Arrow, etc) on Blueray-Very Limited explanation of what various TV controls do --- both the skimpy user manual that comes with the TV and the on-screen guide have very limited explanation of what the settings are for.EDIT 16 Dec 2012I still consider this to be the best TV I have owned.  However, the glossy screen is OK during the day but at night the glossy screen is a problem when lights are on, they show up as reflections on the screen.  The old Sony HDTV that this replaced had a matt screen so this was not a problem.  My solution to avoid having a totally dark room was to buy a couple of low intensity lamps to place behind the tv.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding TV! LG does it again!  Firmware update today (7/20/12)", "Author": "Mike \"Movie Buff\"", "ReviewID": "R2VQ9LLTEDYDFH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the first time, I will be writing and updating as the weeks go by for this item. The TV that this replaces was a 42\" Sharp Aquos LCD. The reason why I'm replacing it is because:1: The PCB (the printed circuit board) is malfunctioning to the point where any day the TV will die; it gets worse as the weeks go by. Sometimes, 1 \"dead\" pixel, a few weeks later it's 2 etc. Then everything seems fine.2. The warranty just expired3. My infant has become very mobile and was grabbing the old TV a lot; so if I'm mounting a TV, it will be a new one!** You can skip this part if you don't want to know my research**I went to several brick and mortar stores; namely PCR&Son;, Abes of Maine, Sears, and BB. 6th Avenue Electronics was forced into closure. Amazon had the lowest price and I was skeptical ordering online as I heard horror stories about deliveries, yet thinking about it, how is it any different than ordering it and having it delivered from a brick and mortar store? I was all set to order from PCR&S; as I showed him some quotes and papers I printed out. They quoted as low as $1986 and that was the lowest. I was really thinking that this salesman was saying take it or leave it. He wouldn't negotiate and he wouldn't go as low as $1900; yeah, I was even making myself pay more because I wanted to see if he'd go down. Nope! I even went to BB and they wouldn't even go lower than PCR or even match them. Well, I basically said screw it; I took a chance and the funniest thing was that the TV was $1749 on Amazon and when I accidentally left it in my shopping cart, a message was waiting for me,\" The price has gone down, the new price will reflect your purchase. It went down to $1699 and wow, it went back up to $2300 just today. I ordered the TV on Friday June 8, (before midnight), I was able to pick June 13 for delivery which was delivered by CEVA. I even called their office which is based in Seattle, WA and asked if they can deliver it close to 6pm since the window was between 3pm-6pm. I wanted to make sure I was home. My wife was home but I'm the anal one!! Their main branch gave me the local number (which was at JFK Airport) and told me to call. The JFK office didn't seem as nice but oh well, didn't let that spoil my excitement of getting this TV. Don't let a brick and mortar store fool you; the 6 pairs of 3d glasses is thrown in by LG not by the store. PCRicard salesman freaken lied to me, \"the TV us so good that we are throwing in 3 extra pairs.\" Yeah, LIAR! Thank goodness I didn't listen to them. I will go there someday and throw it in their face that I bought the TV, just not from them!******************6-13-12TV arrived. The delivery guy was very nice and said that he would unpack the TV and I can inspect it. He was very helpful, was not in a rush (or rushing me) and we put the TV together. I hooked it up to my Verizon FIOS STB. Word of caution, do not put the HDMI plug into the TV when it's off. It wouldn't recognize the HDMI source. When I left the TV on and unplugged the HDMI plug; I reinserted it and bingo; the TV recognized the new input and there was the Verizon logo on the screen.At the ripe age of 36, I've grown anal. I turned on all the lights in the room and even brought a flashlight to inspect the whole TV for cracks and defects. Gladly; NONE were found!The remote control manual is just a long piece of paper and it explains the basics. Not bad. You might get confused as to the paper that came with it that's in several languages. Ignore that. At first I thought that was the manual which was why I thought it was garbage! I was wrong! Only minor issue was how to put the batteries in the magic remote. It took the 2 of us to figure out how to get the batteries in. FYI, on the bottom of the remote, push were it says push. The bottom opens up. The TV manual, I mistook for being worthless as well. Nope, it was decent enough to understand.When the remote and the TV first met, it was love at first site! The on screen instructions show you how to calibrate it and its features. I happen to like the remote, it's small and with few buttons. I love how it's a wireless mouse! The QMenu/Apps gets you to all the apps and if you want to change the inputs. Easy enough! I prefer a remote control with few buttons so this is right down my alley. The precision and use of the magic remote was easy and there were no issues. It's very responsive and all you need to do is pick up the remote and the pointer shows up on the screen. Leaving it alone for a while and the pointer goes away.When I first turned on the TV, I saw some bleeding which got me nervous. When the TV went onto the standard channel; Channel 2 (Local news was on); no bleeding, no clouds, no nothing except a picture quality that was gorgeous! When there was a tremendous amount of \"black\" on the screen; still no bleeding. I was so happy! I love this TV. I went to a movie channel and turned on the Met game. Baseball never looked so awesome (sorry for the word awesome!). I changed from 2D to 3D and the baseball game looked Grrrrrrrrreat! Wow, I was amazed. I'm also amazed that the estimated power usage is $14 a year which is less than half what my LCD was rated at. I think my Sharp LCD was in the high $20s or low $30s.I watched Meatballs (1979) and the picture on standard and HD was perfect. The picture quality was so clear and so gorgeous, I was mesmerized by it!8:10pm 6/15...I'm watching Titanic. The colors and picture is amazing!All and all, the picture quality is spectacular. It's like the actors and actresses are right there in your living room. I can't comment that it's better than plasma as I've never owned one. Believe me when i say this, when you turn the TV on; you will be amazed at the picture quality for standard definition, HD, and 2D->3D conversion. 2D-3D conversion is so crisp and lifelike, I was watching women's volleyball and I was AMAZED to the point of getting hit on the back of my head by my wife :)**It would be wise to put the TV away from any window. The screen is very glossy. The manual also recommends you not keep it near a window that can become very bright. My laptop light when it's on (having the laptop open) does reflect on the TV so a word of caution; you might get the,\" turn it off or move away look.\"I took some pictures of some of the channels I was on. Amazon seems to not want to upload them so they will be there soon.=======================to be continued in a week or 2.*Update* 7/20/12For those watching my review, sorry it took so long. I'm out of breath chasing my toddler around! :) Last thing that I wanted to do was go on my laptop! So having this TV for more than a month I have to say that I'm still loving it. I'm amazed at how thin it is and how close to the edge the picture is. I have my TV set to Vivid and Tru Motion turned up to max values. Vivid makes everything on the TV bright and lifelike. I have the energy saving mode on as well and the picture is never dim enough that I can't see it. I did notice some ghosting but as one reviewer noted, it seems like it only creeps up on SD channels. It's a rarity I must stress on my TV. I've never experienced ghosting on HD channels. I'm so glad I bought it on Amazon and not PC Richard. The day I purchased it here, it went down $50 and within a week, it went down another $100. If I remember correctly, the TV was priced at $1799, it went down to $1749, then down to $1649. After the 2 week window I had, it went down another $50. Hey, I'm not complaining. I got it for $1649 where PCR and BB wanted to charge me $1986. Not bad for a $2500 retail TV!* Side note: Don't believe PCR or anyone who says they are offering extra 3D glasses as \"there\" set comes with 6...LG already has 6 glasses in the box! What was great was on top of the purchase, I got a $50 gift certificate from Amazon using my Amazon card while also taking $30 off the TV using my leftover points from before!*7/21/12* Firmware updateWhen I turned on the TV after coming home from dinner, a window popped up saying that there was a firmware update. The update took less than 5 minutes (downloaded, installed, and reboot). I wish it showed what was in the update but that didn't happen. It just showed the new firmware version and the window went bye bye by itself.1/9/13-----Still loving the TV!

It is one of the sexiest looking televisions I've ever gazed upon, and even against my cheapo IKEA entertainment center, it manages to look quite at home.As for picture quality, it's perfect.

Got the \"Family Pack\" of LG glasses thrown in for free (bought it through BeachCamera, by the way.  GREAT service.) and the family pack comes with ONE pair of the lightest, sleekest 3D glasses you could ever ask for.  I love this set.Viewing distance is best around 10' or 11'.

This is gorgeous.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "For those hooking up to a computer", "Author": "Eric Winslette", "ReviewID": "R1DWEJE7CMLOAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the 47LM7600 for roughly 4 months, and have been extremely happy with it. I won't go into a lot of detailed writing, as the positive reviews on this tv are numerous. I will say that there is flashlighting along the edges ONLY during transition screens and not during actual programming. Other than that, the picture is great on this tv both in 3D and in normal 1080P. Internet apps have a little bit of slowness, but nothing that terrible. Internet browser is extremely slow and hard to use though.This review will be focused on those who are hooking a computer up to this TV and a receiver to watch blu-rays and play 3D games. There are some hurdles to jump to get the most of the experience, and I wanted to share some info you might find useful. My computer is connected via HDMI to the receiver, then another HDMI from the receiver to the tv. The first thing you will likely notice is the terrible lag from your mouse. To correct this, on the TV go home->input list(along bottom)->change device name(bottom right). Select the input the pc is on and change the name to \"PC\". This will eliminate the lag from the computer. I have an Nvidia graphics card, so the rest of the review will be tailored towards those with the same. I THINK ATI cards may have a similar procedure.First off, if you have an Nvidia card, you will have to buy Nvidia 3D TVPlay in order to output 3D from your PC. There may be other software that does it, but I do not know. The cost is around $40. Upon buying and downloading, you can run the 3D test from the computer to the TV, but you will be disappointed. You will notice that you are only able to output at 30Hz at 1080. 30Hz is unplayable in games, I never even tried playing a 3D blu-ray at this frame rate. The problem is with the tv's EDID (Extended Display Identification Date). It basically tells the computer the display's refresh rates, resolutions, audio outputs, etc. Since the LG isn't considered \"Optimized for GeForce 3D\", the full functionality of 3DTV Play will be limited. There are workarounds, however.**DISCLAIMER**What I am about to suggest involves downloading and modifying files in order to trick the computer into thinking the TV and receiver and receive 60Hz 3D content and full surround sound support. Be sure to create a system restore point in case you need to roll back the driver that will change. Neither Amazon nor I assume responsibility for anything that could go wrong. Always scan files with an anti-virus software before downloading.**END DISCLAIMER**Hopefully I did not scare you off with the disclaimer, the process really isn't that hard or complicated once you know what to do. First, search google for the Acer HR274H EDID override. The main link I found was from an Nvidia 3dvision blog.Download the ZIP file at the bottom and extract the \"Acer HR274H.inf\". Load the driver to the TV display by on the computer going to Device manager->monitors. Right click on the tv's display and then \"update driver software\", then \"browse my computer for driver software\", then \"let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\". Browse to the Acer .inf file and load it. Keep the inf file around in case we need to alter it. There are two checks you must now do. Go to the nvidia control panel, then to \"set up stereoscopic 3D\". Above \"set keyboard shortcuts\", make sure the optimized for Geforce logo is visible. If it is, this should set you up for playing 3D content at 60Hz in 1080P. Next, check your available sound by going to the sound settings in the control panel on the pc. Click on the Acer and hit configure. At this point, on your receiver you may see different things. On mine, all I could see was stereo. Some others may see their full list of supported surround formats, at which point they are done. For those like me that only see stereo, don't fret, it can be fixed.The first thing to check is the hdmi audio setting on your receiver. Make sure that it is set to AMP or AMP only. If this fixes your sound issue, then you are done. If not, follow these steps. Download \"monitor asset manager 2.6\" from En Tech Taiwan website. This software will allow us to scan the EDID of the receiver and replace the supported audio formats of the Acer EDID. Disconnect the HDMI cable from the receiver to the TV and make sure you have a secondary display you can use the computer from. When ready with ONLY the computer hooked up to the receiver, run the moninfo.exe. You should see the \"display ids\" in the upper left corner. Click on the one that corresponds to the receiver, it will be the \"real time\" one that is not the monitor. Once it is selected, go to file->create inf. Save it with a name that you will know it is the receiver INF. Close moninfo and open the Acer HR274H INF in text pad. Also open the INF created from the receiver. Near the bottom of the receiver INF, look for \"HKR,EDID_OVERRIDE,\"1\",\". All of the following \"0x03\" etc on that line is the sound information. Copy that line AND ONLY that line. If you copy \"[DEL_CURRENT_REG]\", you went too far. Once copied, go into the Acer HR274H INF and find the same \"HKR,EDID_OVERRIDE,\"1\",\" line. Replace this line of information with one you copied from the receiver INF. Save the modified Acer HR274H INF with a different name making sure to keep the .inf extension. Now reconnect the tv and replace the display driver that it uses like we did earlier with the Acer HR274H EDID. This time, choose your modified Acer HR274H INF file to load. Double check the sound in control panel to make sure more than stereo appears. Hopefully this has worked for you and you are now done! If you have questions, just let me know. Be aware that you will need a 3D blu-ray compatible disc drive and software such as power dvd or something else in order to appropriately display 3D blu-rays.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV but not quite \"Smart\" enough", "Author": "Douglas", "ReviewID": "R24KET6XSXX7W2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Newer UPDATE: May 28, 2013Amazon Prime Video now has an app on the 2012 LG smart TV's.  App setup is easy (TV shows a key which is entered on the web), but froze the TV.  Turned off the TV for one minute and then back on -- worked like a reboot and now works fine.My initial review complained that Prime streaming wouldn't work through the browser and there was no app.  App works fine; video quality about DVD resolution.  Probably easier to set up your video watchlist through computer or tablet instead of searching via point & click with the Wand.UPDATE: Now 6 months old.I originally gave only 4 stars because the internet interface was way too clunky.  What I've seen with other brands and models is that this is true for all of them.  It reminds me of the early days of the internet -- too many incompatible operating systems and software.Since these problems are not unique to the LG7600, I'm bumping up the review to 5 stars.  This really is a great set.  New models will likely be out soon, and prices have dropped a little since I bought mine.---------------older, more complete review---------------I've had the TV for 2 1/2 months now. Time for a review.I'm very pleased with it overall.Setup: Wall mounted. Use Comcast with TiVo Premier XL. Hard wired ethernet.1-Overall.  Appearance is beautiful.  Only see the silver strip when the TV is off and only a 1/2 inch of black border when on.  This helps this 55\" fit into almost the same space as the previous 47\" it replaced. Magic remote works fine but takes some getting used to.  Not quite as smooth as it needs to be, but navigating with a standard remote (bought one of those online) is next to impossible.2-Video quality out of the box is OK, but not crisp.  Original settings will be fine if it will be in a dark room.  Most of the calibrations on the web will help fine-tune this, but I found most of those were also more suited to a dark room. Even the TVs walk-through calibration left it muddy. My TV room is sunny and has a 6-foot patio door and two full windows. I did find one online suggestion to set the backlight at 100% and go from there.  Made a world of difference.  You CAN get this to look good in a well lit room, but you will have to experiment.  Unless you never watch TV during the day, I suggest you change your settings during the daytime, and once that looks good, it's easy to just knock down the brightness at night if you want the movie house level (I'm leaving mine alone -- took too long to get it right).  Speaking of bright rooms, you're wondering about glare.  It's not a matte finish, but much less glossy than competitors.  As long as a window isn't directly reflecting (mirroring) your viewing, you'll be fine.  Off-angle light sources are no problem.3D works fine, but I think it's a gimmick we'll all tire of soon.  Still looks like 2D paper dolls (actors) at different distances.  Not natural.  The 2D to 3D feature of the TV actually looks more natural than true 3D.  Give it a try, you might be intrigued.Turned local dimming off, just gets distracting with sections of the screen trying to go blacker than other parts. Your eye/brain is better at perceiving that an area is supposed to be black if it isn't constantly reminded that it's sometimes gray and sometimes black.You'll see several reviews about light leakage.  I have a little in the upper right, but it's mostly noticeable when the TV has no signal going to it (switching inputs, etc.).  Don't notice it during regular viewing.3-Audio quality is good.  Better than the Samsung it replaced.  Good midlevel boost to help dialog using its ClearVoice option. Although the speakers face down, I have a fireplace mantel 6 inches below the TV and this helps project into the room. In the audio setup, it asks for wall vs stand mount, but in my situation, stand mount sounds better.  Sound bars/theaters will certainly add to the movie house experience, but they aren't necessary, and the complexity of adding more controllers and the required spousal learning curve wasn't worth it.4-Smart TV.  This is where things are only half-baked and where I (originally) deduct one star. If you can do ethernet instead of relying on the internal wifi, things will run smoother and setup is easier.  And when firmware/software updates are available, LG will instruct you to run a cable to the TV instead of using the wifi.One of the reasons you are reading this on Amazon is because you like Amazon, and like me, are an Amazon Prime member.  Well if you're hoping to find their Prime Instant Video here, you're out of luck.  The LG does not have an app for Amazon here. It does have the popular Netflix and HuluPlus apps so maybe sometime in the future, LG and Amazon will work out some $$$ agreement.I read somewhere, \"Oh well, you can always use the browser and watch Prime Video in the browser.\"  Nope, that won't work either.  As Amazon emailed me today:>>>I'm sorry, your device 'LG 55LM7600' is not compatible  to watch Amazon videos.>>>But I know you're saying, \"but the TV has a browser, and you can watch Amazon in a browser!\"  Again, NO.  All the button clicking will work fine, but the browser screen stays black even as the progress bar shows that the movie is running. LG has a crippled browser that blocks what it wants to block.  And Amazon is not the only thing it will block.  Watch YouTube on TV?  Of course you expect to.  YouTube has designated some videos for mature audiences (PG-13 is as racy as it gets) and on the computer you can just click and watch.  Not on the LG browser.  They are completely blocked (and no, there is no parental control turned on).  There are probably other areas that the browser has crippled, but it's hard enough browsing on a TV (like browsing on your smartphone) to spend much time looking.  Stick to Justin Bieber videos and you'll be fine.So that's a bit frustrating.  Just like TiVo and Amazon not letting me view the same Prime streaming videos, only the Instant rental ($$) videos. So with all this high tech hardware, to watch Amazon's Prime offerings, I have to watch on my 24\" computer screen or 8\" iPad Mini.  Sad, so sad.Conclusion: Well made, worth the money especially now that the prices are consistently in the $1500-1600 range.

The screen and image quality are superior that of other 55\" TVs in this price range that I personally viewed at the retail stores. And, although I don't watch 3D much at all, the image quality is very good, even with the standard LG-provided glasses.The initial setup was a snap; I probably had the TV's remote, image quality, time/date, and connected to my home network via the internal wireless in less than 5 minutes. Granted, my picture setup was quick because I'm completely content with the standard picture quality options provided by LG. I read several reviews on the remote from people that think it's quirky or hard to use and I completely disagree. If you've ever moved a Nintendo Wii controller, then it's the same concept. It's a floating cursor that's quick to understand and learn. It's a whole lot more simple than a giant remote with a bunch of buttons.Visually, the TV is beautiful. It has a very thin frame around the screen that is barely noticeable and very elegant. The display deserves an award- it's one of the best I've seen. It does have a glossy-ish finish to it and might not be ideal in extremely bright rooms, however I have no complaints in my brightly-lit living room. The glossy finish on the display is why the colors pop and the images are razor sharp. The frame itself is very (very) thin and looks magnificent on the included TV stand. I temporarily have the TV on the stand until I get around to mounting it, but the shape of the stand has a minimal space impact on a table due to the position of the feet space. Surprisingly it's very stable and looks attractive.The TV is edge-lit, so you might see a very slight amount of \"bleeding\" or \"clouding\" on the edge, which is common for this type of LED TVs. Mine is very minimal and isn't noticeable during standard watching, however if yours is bad, LG will be on the spot to repair it in your home for the first year. Powering on the TV takes about 3 seconds. Many other vendors need to boot up their systems before a picture will display (Toshiba 55\" TVs do this and it takes about 20 seconds...). The built-in LG apps are fun, but my biggest complaint is that it lacks Pandora. I suppose later on they might offer it.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this LG TV.

There is a slight \"blooming\" effect with the back-light that would annoy most videophiles, but this only occurs during black screens or extremely dark scenes in programs. No one I showed the set to noticed this effect unless I literally pointed it out.  The speakers, in my opinion, are no more or less special than your average flat panel speakers. Although there are numerous settings available to tweak, I highly recommend configuring a surround sound/receiver setup or at least a home-theatre-in-a-box, if you're planning on making an investment on a tv of this caliber. It is greatly worth the investment.  The 3D effect is amazing. There is, yet again, a multitude of options to tweak in 3D mode, such as depth, sound, and even left/right eye alignment, which can be very useful. And the 2D to 3D feature makes it even more intriguing, and works far better than my expectations, especially on video games.  The remote is very simple and intuitive. Is you ever messed around with a Nintendo Wii, you've already know how to operate this remote. It is a very simple point and click interface, and even has a built in Infrared Blaster to program to your television provider's equipment very easily.  The tv is Internet connectable with built in WiFi and Ethernet capabilities. Both work flawlessly. There are downloadable games and apps thru LG's marketplace. And preloaded apps (i.e. Netflix, YouTube, Pandora) for your streaming pleasure. There is also 3D content provided via rental thru Disney and LG themselves thru a 3D world section.The design of the tv is very striking. It has very thin edges (bezel) about the thickness of a fingernail, and the stand is very futuristic looking and is very sturdy despite the way it is designed.Overall, the is great tv for those looking a new LED tv at a decent price.

challenge is difficult enough to diminish this amazing entertainment experience.After attaching the TV to its plastic stand, which is a stylish, faux stainless steel, the TV was placed on a cabinet a little less than four feet off the floor. There wasn't enough swivel in the stand to avoid the living room windows (and they appear often in my video). To alleviate the glare, a professional window tinting company covered the living room window, blocking 99% of the sun's UV rays. The result was only a slight improvement. My recommendation is to use a wall mount and get the TV up higher off the floor.If you are running an internet connection with a speed of 10 Mbps or less prepare to struggle loading the free content and apps LG offers in its Smart TV features. I recommend using a connection speed of at least 25 Mbps. Check your current internet contract in case it has a penalty for early withdrawal. Bottom line, LG's Smart TV features are important enough to the entire package that it is important to confirm your internet connection speed before buying.The 3D glasses are another feature to note that isn't addressed in the video review. Six pairs of 3D glasses come with the set. They are battery-free, light and relatively comfortable to wear. I expected the glasses would interfere with the rest of the room but the view is much like a pair of sunglasses. I could look around the room without having to look over the lenses or take them off. I wouldn't want to spend a day wearing these glasses but they are comfortable enough to last through a movie or two.In summary, LG Cinema Screen 55LM7600 55-Inch 3D TV is an impressive package, loaded with LG's TruMotionTM 240Hz technology, a wide range of connectivity options and six pairs of 3D glasses. So long as you have a fast internet connection and the wall space to mount this TV (to avoid glare), this will be love at first sight.Rating: Five stars.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding picture and impressive 3D", "Author": "PT Cruiser", "ReviewID": "RA3FYALQD6V4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I saw this TV, I thought 3D was too gimmicky and not very practical with big expensive active shutter glasses that flickered from one eye to the other.  And with mono-vision contact lenses or glasses my eyes just couldn't resolve the 3D images.  So I was completely surprised that the lightweight plastic glasses that come with this TV actually worked fine with my lenses and I could see the images in 3D.  The glasses are light and flexible enough that I can wear them in front of my glasses for hours at a time. And the cool thing is that there's a 3D mode for regular TV or DVD programing that converts the 2D to 3D.  It's more subtle than watching a 3D Blu ray movie where you get the \"out of screen\" effects that jump out at you, but there is definite depth, especially on shows with lots of scenery and sweeping camera shots, like the Travel Channel or Green Planet. It's very noticeable when there are close-up images with things in the background.  There was a show with mountain climbers on snow covered peaks with more mountains in the distance where the 3D was breathtaking. I like the way it draws me in to my regular TV shows as well, kind of like being in the courtroom when watching \"The Good Wife\" or in the audience on \"American Idol\".  We like the depth control set to it's max on the manual setup and the depth turned all the way up.  That way the picture looks like it's deeper than the edge of the screen with images in the foreground looking almost level with the screen edge. There are several other 3D settings that give you lots of control. (If you own the TV and want to see some great \"out of screen\" effects, watch \"Mentalist\" which is included on the TV and can be accessed through your \"Home\" menu.)But there is so much more that makes this TV fun than just the 3D.  There are all kinds of customizable apps, videos and the web.  Unfortunately Amazon Streaming Video (lots of free videos if you're a Prime member) isn't available yet, but will be added sometime this year, (you can still access it via the web.) You can get movies from services like Hulu or Netflix or Vudu if you subscribe. You can also access Facebook and Twitter so you never have to miss a thing.  And if you have WiFi you can access files that you have on your smartphone, tablet or PC easily with this TV.  Setting up the Wifi was simple and quick, just put in the password when the initial walk-through setup asks for it and you're connected.There are LOTS of settings for the picture, sound and 3D, so many that I played around with for hours at first. We have 3 family members with 4 opinions so I'm sure there will be additional tweaking until we're all satisfied. I think the easiest way to get the picture looking pretty decent when you first set it up is to use the \"Standard\" setting and then tweak it here and there depending on your lighting.  I was going to buy a calibration disc but I think we've got it the way we like it now just playing around with the settings. There is a power saving mode that is supposed to dim the screen when it's darker in the room but we find it dims it too much and makes the picture look dark. LG's TruMotion 240Hz technology is great for watching fast motion because you don't see any blur like you do on some TV's which is great for action movies or sporting events.  There are settings to control how you want this to look as well. We haven't changed any of those from the way it they were when we got the set because it's handling it very well.Our TV is in a large, long room that includes the kitchen, eating area and family room.  With porcelain tile floors and only an area rug, a couple doors on one side and windows almost all the way down the other, the acoustics are terrible.  We had a Sony Bravia before this and it was always hard to hear what people were saying, even with the volume turned up and that had speakers built into the front sids.  I thought for sure that we were going to need a sound bar for this TV since the speakers are in the back and bottom. (We don't use the surround sound system for everyday TV.) But this TV has something called \"Clear Voice 2\" that makes voices sound very distinct.  There's also several other settings for sound.  I'm actually able to turn the sound way down at night and still hear it, even in this room where sound waves are bouncing all over the place.  It's impressive.Then there's the Magic Remote, you're either going to love it or hate it.  If you've owned a Wii you'll probably be happy with it.  It acts pretty much the same.  It may seem a little skittish at first, but by the time you get your TV set up the way you want it and use it to look around at all the features it'll feel much more accurate.  This remote is used to turn the TV on and off, switch between regular TV and 3D, access the menu, and control the volume. We have DirecTv which has its own remote as well as a URC R40 \"My Favorite Remote\" Advanced Universal Remote Control for up to 18 A/V Components.  Right now we have to use one of those remotes to change channels or look at channel listings or recorded shows and the Magic Remote to turn it off and on.  I hope to program the other two remotes to handle the off and on and volume.  There's also an iPhone app called \"LG Magic Remote\" that can turn your iPhone into a remote.  I haven't tried it yet.  (Too busy watching 3D movies and shows.)The screen on this TV is a glossy kind of finish that is somewhat reflective.  Even with all the windows in our room it hasn't been very noticeable so far although we did readjust the window blinds to cut down on the lightOne word about watching 3D movies; you need to have a 3D Blu Ray player to play them.  And if you're running a home theater system, you need a 3D capable receiver.  My older receiver has a HDMI 1.3 port that won't pass the signal.  (Blu Ray and regular movies play through the surround sound system just fine.)  HDMI 1.4 is what's needed for 3D.  So my solution for now is to connect my 3D DVD player directly to the TV (for 3D movies only) with a  HDMI cable rather than through the receiver. Right now we're just using the TV speakers for 3D movies but I could run an optical or coaxial digital audio cable to the receiver for surround sound. Eventually I'll get an 3D capable receiver so I can connect with HDMI and get the really high definition sound tracks available with Blu ray and 3D.This TV is nothing short of amazing and the 3D really adds a new dimension, even on regular TV shows. Two thumbs up for this LG Cinema Screen 55LM7600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "I AM A BELIEVER!!!  LG Cinema Screen 47LM7600", "Author": "ksan47", "ReviewID": "R3PRP13LXSQARU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent months researching the perfect 46/47 inch LCD-LED TV.  I USED to think of myself as a Sony and Samsung guy, but not anymore!  In this price range, LG is king now, imo.  It took me a while to make the switch, I even went though Samsung TVs which cannot even compare to this LG LM7600.  Yes the Samsung may have a SLIGHTLY better picture quality but does it justify the price?  I think NOT.  LG is just as good, and for the price, I say BETTER than Sony and Samsung!  (I should mention another notable name creeping up, VIZIO - watch out for these guys, I've seen their stuff and I'm impressed.  Another couples MONTHS and they'll be competing with Sony and Samsung, and yes, even LG (because they're prices are EVEN LOWER) if not already.)Anyway, the LG 47LM7600 is a sure WINNER.  If you are not sure like me, read the 200+ reviews here and other places recommending it.  The picture is stunning, and bright enough for a home setting, even too bright.  I use LCDbuyingguide calibrations, and it's amazing.  I have all good to say, and everything has already been said.  I am a believer now, and now that I own one, I will strongly recommend it over any Sony and Samsung (comparable models) any day!!!!  Buy it.Personally, I am not keen on 3D, but if you are, I can honestly say it's worth it.  Much better than Active 3D.  And heck, it's fun while it lasts.My two, complaints, if you want to call them that, are:(1) I wish they had a analog digital out, but for a $20 conversion kit, I can live with that.(2) The web browser - although a great thought, not really practical for video playback.  NONE of the videos I try open up in full screen, EVEN LG and YouTube ones.  Also, the flash player is very outdated compared to competitors.  I think the browser is more for text and image use (i.e. the news, social feeds, emails, and just browsing the web).  If you want to watch videos in full screen, connect your laptop, you have four options for HDMI!  And a dual core processor would be nice, but hey they have that on the LM8600, so if you want it shell out the extra $300 or so.  If LG ever release a firmware update for a current flash player and enable full screen viewing, I will be on cloud nine!On a side note, YOU WILL GET USED TO THE REMOTE!!!  I certainly did.  Give it time.  I actually prefer this remote over the traditional one (which you can purchase separately anyway if you definitely cannot adjust to it).  Think of it as the future, adapt or get left behind.  Heck, pretty soon we will be talking to our TVs, oh wait, Samsung!  That's just weird and right down freaky if you ask me: when you're staring at the TV someone at Samsung's consumer research department is staring back at you!!  :)  Kidding (or not)...Anyway, not to make this a long review and repeat all the good things already mentioned by others, I love this TV.  Best decision I've made and glad I went with LG.  You should try them if you are not a believer by now!LG = Life's Good (It sure is for me right about now!  Let's see what's on the tele.)  Cheers", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding performance. Quite a thrill to watch.", "Author": "H. Ge", "ReviewID": "R1MUAUXSY48GAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research I finally decided on purchasing the LG M7600, for it strikes a nice balance between features and price. It features passive 3D and a whopping 55\" screen with practically no edges. And its price is well under many of those competing active 3D TVs, which many see as inferior to the passive 3D technology (it needs batteries in the glasses, and can flicker).Now onto the quality and performance. In my humble opinion, it easily rivals any 3D TV on the market, whether passive or active. The screen is bright and crisp. I haven't noticed any light bleeding problems that a few others have complained. The GUI is very intuitive and easy to navigate around. I was able to tune it up to my viewing preferences in less than 30 min.Movie in HD format is crystal clear and sharp. I've tried the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and watched the last two EURO 2012 soccer games on this TV. In terms of contrast and brightness, it rivals those of the best plasma TV. In terms of motion flow, at 240 Hz, it is as sharp and fluid as any of the top brands. How do I know? I went to my cousins and did a comparison. One of them owns a Sony active 3D, and the other has a Samsung plasma 3D.Now movies in 3D is a thrill. What's interesting is that this TV, although passive 3D, doesn't work the same way the movie theater works. Movie theaters use two linear polarizers for the glasses, and if you tilt your head too much, the image will not compose correctly. This TV doesn't use linear polarizers. (One way to tell is if you put the lenses of two pairs of glasses back to back, rotate one 90 degrees. If it turns black, it is linear polarizer. But this one doesn't.) So no matter how you tilt your head, the 3D image always composes right. I haven't figured out the physics yet, but it always work. The downside to this is that the 3D glasses you inadvertently took from IMAX theaters won't work on this TV. (So it's time to give them back now.) But the TV came with 6 pairs, more than my couch can accommodate.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving It So Far!", "Author": "Concerned", "ReviewID": "R29NS0KA38FE67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just wanted to write a quick review that might help anyone having trouble deciding on buying this item.Physical Appearance:  The TV looks amazing! It's like having a 47 inch iPhone screen!  The screen/glass looks beautiful, the slim and chic trim is gorgeous and I have absolutely no complaints.Image/Quality:  The image quality on this device is beautiful.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to the quality of my set (I honestly find myself looking for reasons not to like this TV at times, it seems to surprise me every time I watch a new movie/play a new game) and I must say I am very pleased with the results.  I haven't noticed any bleeding, which many customers seemed to complain about, it seems to be perfectly fine.  The LED Plus at 240 Hz is simply great!3D:  I haven't used the 2D to 3D option much, but I have noticed that the quality varies depending on the program you're watching, and is still a fun option, especially when playing games.  I have never watched a 3D movie on home system outside of the theaters, so I wouldn't know what to compare it to, or how to rate the 3D feature on this device, so I'll leave it at that.Connectivity/Wi-Fi/Apps:  I love to connect my laptop to my TV for games via HDMI, and the quality is amazing.  No complaints, at least not yet.  I did have some trouble watching videos through my flash-drive (the video I was watching froze, and wouldn't resume) but turning off/on the TV and re-inserting my flash-drive took care of the problem.  I have used it multiple times since then, and it has been working flawlessly since then.  There are plenty of slots for USB and HDMI, which is always a plus in my books.  The system reads my devices in no time, and has played any video format I have thrown its way.  The Wi-Fi on this device is awesome!  It's fast, and very reliable.  I can browse the web with no lag, or stream a movie via Netflix without a problem.  The App-Store was a little weird, I haven't gotten used to it yet, and couldn't find anything for Amazon Prime/HBO GO which bummed me out, but as far as stability and speed goes, I haven't had any problems.Remote:  I tried over and over to love this remote, but I can't seem to get over its flat surfaced/button-lacking layout.  The whole motion/mouse feature is awesome, and takes a little getting used to, but I like to FEEL my buttons, I find myself muting and scrolling everywhere before finding my volume buttons.  I would love it if LG stuck to the more \"default\" layout (you know, with shortcut buttons for a menu/input list/etc.) instead of giving you a HOME and BACK button that takes you to a menu before taking you where you could have been with a simple click of a button.Overall:  I read a lot of reviews before pulling the trigger on this guy.  I was a bit skeptical at first, but thankfully, it continues to surprise me.  I'm glad I jumped on this deal, the image quality is undeniably great and its features are awesome.  I have yet to come up with anything negative to say about this device.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Improved through endless firmware patches.

The first thing I noticed was that the factory setup for the picture was quite off and required a lot of tweaking.  The remote control with its featured pointer is rather inaccurate, although after a while you got accustomed to it and your brain compensates for the aiming by itself.  Another issue is the GUI; it is really slow to respond and during the transitions.But the most important and really terrible thing about this HDTV is its *AWFUL* DSP that gets lost with fast movements.  When watching a basketball game you see the image becomes chopped every 15 seconds or so, as the processing cannot cope with the movement.  HORRIBLE!.  And believe me I have tried many different setups with and without \"True Motion\", etc.LG has been providing several firmware updates through the year but it seems that the problem has somewhat aggravated.I am really disappointed with this TV (I miss my old 720P LCD Sony VEGA that broke down after 7~8 years of impeccable performance).I would definitely not recommend this TV to anybody watching sports.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "If you want a nice 3D TV get this one.", "Author": "Randall", "ReviewID": "R2LHQAYLTS2OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was on the fence if spending a $1000 on a TV was really worth it. I was interested in a 3D TV, some people say it's a gimmick or a fade but I was very curious about it and after reading several reviews on lots of TV's I decided on the LG Cinema Screen 55LM7600 55-Inch. I like that it was a passive 3D TV and came with 6 pair of glasses, the same glasses from the movie theater you get. This TV also had everything else I wanted, good size screen at 55, it's a smart TV, has lots of HDMI Inputs and etc.After getting the TV I must say I'm impressed with it. I tested out the 3D feature that really pushed me to get this kind of TV and I was not disappointed at all in fact I was blown away. I put in Yogi Bear 3D that the kids have seen several times, well it was like a whole new experience this time around, some of the effects even suprised me, It looked like a few things were coming straight at me and I could reach out and grab them. I loved it, the kids loved it, it was just too cool.A $1000 is a lot for a TV but I feel this one is well worth it. The only thing I had trouble with is getting the 3D to work at first. You must have a High Speed HDMI Cable my PS3 would not detect a 3D TV without it.

The initial setup was really easy, I had the wifi up and running and the TV picked it up right away. Updates to the firmware occur from time to time but I haven't had any problem delaying them until it was convenient. No problems with any software update either. With a fast internet connection, streaming movies from VUDO and Netflix are no problem and you can easily connect to videos and pictures on any computer on your network.Even with the standard settings the picture was really nice in HD at least until you try to watch hockey, the white was way way too strong under any of the standard settings. To make the nice picture outstanding, take the time to calibrate this unit it's well worth the time and effort. If you don't want to get the disc and go through all the steps yourself search for CNET reviews and simply steal their settings, that's what I did. You won't be sorry and it's easy to do.The 3D is pretty good, better than any other TV I've seen for under $2500.  You can adjust the levels to your liking and the passive glasses are easy to wear.After six months of heavy use flashlighting has been no problem and there are absolutely no hot spots even in a truly dark room. They've done an excellent job of eliminating these problems at this price point on this model.

I'd like to note that I would definitely have kept and loved my set had I received one of those sets.** END UPDATE **Amazon Experience/Shipping Review:I signed up for Amazon Prime in order to take advantage of the free two-day shipping for this unit. My purchase went through smoothly, and I was called by the shipping company, Pilot, in order to schedule a delivery time. The TV arrived during the designated window. The Pilot employee asked me to save him some time and sign the receipt as he was bringing in the unit. I obliged (rookie mistake). I asked him to help unpack and set up the TV so that we could make sure it was in working order, but he responded along the lines of, \"but you just signed here that I didn't need to do that, and I'm double parked so I've got to go.\" He left with me protesting.Retrun Experience Review:After finding my unit unsatisfactory (5 days after I received the TV), I got in touch with Amazon via their online chat. A helpful representative provided a phone number I needed to call for \"Large Item Returns.\" Calling Large Item Returns was quick and easy, and within minutes they had arranged for Pilot to call me and schedule a pick-up. No charge to me. Pilot called to schedule the pickup, and two employees showed up at my apartment during the designated window. As this is a large unit, I needed some assistance getting it back in the box. The Pilot employees were visibly annoyed with the fact that they needed to help me repack the TV. One asked me, \"Is it defective?\" I responded that it was (such level of edge bleeding seemed defective to me). The shipper took that as a cue cram the TV into the box, stand on, no protective covers or styrofoam, and very roughly took the unit out of my apartment with components falling out of the box in transit. Later that day I found the unit's remote on the ground by the elevator.Fortunately Amazon still processed my full refund. My overall experience with Amazon was that of the highest customer service. I would highly recommend purchasing a television through Amazon, with no worries regarding their excellent and convenient return policy for TVs.

I've always been a fan of Samsung, Sony, and Panasonic TV, so before buying this LG TV, I read most of the reviews online. At first I was inclined to buying the Samsung UN46ES6500 however when I read some of the reviews online, it didn't get great reviews compared to this LG 7600 TV that I happened to come across on Amazon. So I decided to give it a try since it was cheaper and had great reviews.  Here's my opinion on some of the features:TV Picture Quality: ExcellentSound: ExcellentTrue Motion (soap opera affect): this is good on certain shows including sports, however for movies, I prefer it to be normal, which this TV allows to turn off the True Motion at ease.2D-3D: This is a great add on. Though this is not as good as a normal show filmed in 3D, it is still a neat feature where you can definitely notice a slight 3D effect3D shows/films: Excellent; This TV uses Passive 3D glasses, the newer technology amongst 3D-TVs. I must say that the quality is just like the theaters, if not slightly better. I know Active 3D glasses have better quality and 3D depth, however the benefits of Passive technology outweighs the quality of Active Technology. Passive 3D does not use battery operated glasses, making it lighter and more comfortable to wear. Furthermore, the 3D glasses are cheaper and use the same 3D glasses as in theaters. Advice on this, keep any 3D glasses bought in theaters as they work on passive 3D TV's. I happened to keep several of them from having watched 3D movies in theaters, and in addition to the 6 that the TV came with, I now have a total of about 14 3D glasses, enough for family and friends to all watch at the same time!Remote Control: I like it. I know some people are talking about getting used to it, but I got used to it instantly. It's basically like a Nintendo Wii Remote.Smart TV: Netflix is excellent. The only two minor updates that I recommend form LG is to update the firmware to fix the YouTube App. Just like what others wrote on here about YouTube, it lags and does not play properly. And it is not my internet connection b/c the entire video downloads faster than it plays. Even with the entire video downloaded, it does not play properly. My bluray player that I have also has a YouTube app and that plays the videos smoothly without any lag, so if LG can fix this bug, that would be excellent. Additionally, there is no Pandora App. If LG can add a Pandora App, that would be great also.Overall, this TV is excellent and highly recommended to everyone. I bought the 47\" TV, but if you could afford the 55\" TV, I think that would be better especially if you have a bigger room.

I definitely took my time researching the available options and this seemed like the best quality/price combination for the type of TV I was looking for - around 47\", LED, 3D, TruMotion control (can't stand the \"soap opera\" affect).  The only feature I wish I could have skipped and not paid for was the Smart TV aspect - I have a PS3 and get everything I want with Netflix, Amazon Prime, and my cable service - but maybe I'll find a use for it eventually.  After reading several reviews, I thought I was going to have to tweak quite a few settings to get the optimal picture, but the only settings I ended up changing were to turn off the Auto Energy Saving mode (it was very dim until I did this) and to turn off TruMotion completely (I watched the new Sherlock Holmes movie with it on to give it a try and it pretty much ruined the movie for me).  Now all of my Blu-ray and Netflix shows are absolutely STUNNING - bright, crisp, and colorful.  Aside from the gorgeous picture, the TV itself is very sleek and looks awesome on the walnut-stained entertainment center that I just built.  The super-thin bezel is really quite sexy.  The price on this TV has been fluctuating quite a bit, so if you decide to get it, watch the price for a little while to get it while it's down.

A message was left on my machine that the tv would be delivered on a certain day, within a certain time frame. There was no number to call back so I had to make sure someone was home during that window of time. Thankfully, the tv showed up late that evening and the delivery people were very helpful and professional. We wanted to do the setup ourselves so we decided against having them unpack the set and install it. It was relatively simple to unpack everything and connect the included base so we could see how the tv would set if it was just set on top of a tv stand. After attaching the base, my spouse and I looked at each other and we both agreed this tv needs to be mounted. The base just felt too unsteady and the tv wouldn't sit level; it was always just slightly crooked, not matter how much we adjusted it. So off we went to find a tv stand with a mount as we weren't interested in mounting it on the wall.Once we decided on a stand, it was very easy to remove the tv from the base and attach it. The included rubber protectors that protect each side of the screen are a great idea and made it very simple to move the tv without damaging the screen. Set up was very easy. The component and A/V cables did require an included adapter, but all of the other basic connectors are present. The picture is pretty much edgeless with only a small strip along the bottom as the only exception. I will say this is the nicest tv we've ever owned and the picture is gorgeous. Crisp and clear, with no flashlighting or other distracting effects. The picture out of the box is amazing and the wizards to fine tune it to your own tastes are easily used.As for the magic remote it is similar to the nintendo wiimote but isn't dependent on an infrared grid. It is controlled by motion sensors and it does require calibration each time the arrow selector shows up on the screen. The mute button and select scroll bar are in strange places and I've noticed my fingers will often confuse the two if I'm not looking at the remote directly when I make my selection. The functions are too dependent on motion and if you're not used to this type or remote or have problems with holding your hands steady, it can be difficult. We've tried using our Harmony remote and while it controls the basic functions such as channel, source and volume control you can't operate the menu or control any of the apps. The shape of the remote is strange; it doesn't sit easily on a flat surface.Connecting the wireless was easy, and the wireless is dependable. The web browser app is good, but I've noticed when watching a tv show through the browser, it has a hard time with buffering and it needs more memory for flash video viewing. The flash video advanced function like full screen viewing are not available. The netflix app is ok, but the password will reset itself occasionally and has to be inputed again. Until the latest tv update last week, it would get stuck when exiting the apps page and we'd have to turn the tv off completely for about 10 seconds in order to go back to the main tv menu.For the 3D features, the 2D up converter is ok, but requires a HD source like a blueray player or HD tuner. The included glasses are nice and a good quality but don't work as well if you're using them over prescription glasses. They're the same glasses used in Real 3D in movie theaters, no batteries required. The ones that you get from the theater work just fine on the tv if you happen to bring a pair home with you.Overall this is a gorgeous tv and I don't think you'll be disappointed. We did have a bit of trouble finding a stand in our area that everyone could agree on that would fit the large screen size, but if you'd rather mount it to the wall than that's a moot point.

Nothing else really compares.I had seen a few demo models of this TV in brick-and-mortar stores, but having it set up in my bedroom really gives me a sense of how beautifully designed this piece of equipment is.  The thin-bezel, floating stand, and minimalistic design is absolutely stunning.  Even though the simulated stainless steel stand is made of plastic, the overall aesthetic appeal of the TV leads to the impression that it is more expensive than what it actually goes for at retail price.  I almost went with the 55\" model for my bedroom and am really glad I decided not to.  The 47\" is quite large in itself and is just the right size for the space I'm using it in.Setup was a breeze (Wifi, Netflix was all ready to go within 10 minutes of set up).Though I've only had it for a day, I have been able to play around with it for a bit and I really have to commend the built-in audio in this TV.  Though an external home audio or speaker system can't be beat, the 3D surround sound and other audio options really beef up the sound produced by the television, making voices sharp during dialogue and easy to pick up with the volume at a low level. The 42\" LED Insignia I returned a month ago had atrocious built-in speakers by comparison.  I purchased a sound-bar with the 47LM7600, but still, the audio is good enough that if I were to return the sound bar, I'd be satisfied with it.I'm very pleased with the picture quality so far.  Images are crisp, clean and vivid, although with letterbox 4:3 or cinema widescreen ratio playback, there is some bleeding at the edges, but is expected of any edge-lit LED LCD panel.  I don't have issues with the glass surface reflecting too much light (probably due to the way I've placed the TV in my bedroom), which is something a lot of other reviewers brought up as a concern.  I watched about an hour of 3D content and though cool, I don't really see myself using this feature that often, aside from the occasional 3D blu-ray movie I rent.  After half-an-hour, my eyes start getting strained.There are a lot of customizable user options for sound and picture settings, and the home screen is easy to navigate.  The SmartShare function works seamlessly with my iMac computer, and it allows me to stream 1080p movie files from my hard-drive right to my TV over our WiFi router.One thing that's a bit frustrating is that the swivel stand doesn't pivot as freely as one would hope, and it feels like it's stuck whenever I attempt to pivot the panel to the left or right.I have very few gripes with this television.  I would definitely recommend it (47\" model) as a bedroom or small living room unit.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG55LM7600- Beautiful TV with a mass of settings and features", "Author": "Veneet Katyal \"VR\"", "ReviewID": "R2BYVAVQF5MTA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV after much of deliberation and reading hundreds of positive reviews at different websites. This is an amazing TV with abundance of features and settings. At first I was comparing the picture quality with my Samsung UNB55B8000. Samsung screen are more vivid and I like looking at the vivid screen. But LG default setting is more subtle and easy on eyes. I checked the Tv settings and found out that we have a ton of different picture settings including the vivid setting.

The LG TV app on Apple and Android works great. As this tv does not have a querty keyboard, you can use the browser and type in using the android phone/ipad/iphone,etc. and it works great.

Ordering was easy, delivery was on time. Now moving on to the TV from which I have received only issues one after the other. The TV decide to blow up today (11/30/2013) after just 7 months and smoke starting coming out from behind the panel.Pros:- The inbuilt apps I use (Netflix, Youtube) play decently. Youtube does buffer from time to time though.- I can easily stream videos from my smartphone. Have not faced any buffering issues while streaming from my phone.- Sound is decent for such a thin TV.Cons:- Picture quality has gone from good to average. There is pixelation for fast moving objects irrespective of the input. Blu ray, TV, computer or Netflix. For some HD shows in netflix it is next to impossible to watch due to extreme pixelation. Have tried all possible settings but alas.- There is light bleeding from the edges. Its not so bad on the piece I got but I can see why it could be a problem for many people. Its not visible on bright screens but evident on darker backgrounds.- The remote although smooth makes a simple task more difficult. Although I am used to it now I have to do a few extra steps even in order to change channels. (Move the cursor to the top of the screen, wait for the remote icon to show up, click on it, move the cursor to the bottom and then hit the numbers.)- I had to completely turn off the TV once (remove the power plug), otherwise the remote cursor was stuttering. I am guessing the TV ran out of RAM.- The smart TV app section takes some time to open up. I would think this is due to the processor inside being single core.- Changing between apps is really frustrating. Its extremely slow.Update on 07/19/2013- Have to add an issue related to the display. The blurring and stuttering around fast moving pictures have increased a lot specially for Netflix and regular free TV (via coaxial cable). Played around with setting for a long time without any marked improvement. Will be getting in touch with LG customer support to see if they can help me. If the issue is resolved I will update the reviewUpdate: 08/06/2013- The technician who came to inspect the TV was unaware how to do anything. He could not understand me at all nor could he identify what was wrong. He only said \"will replace motherboard\". I feel extremely disappointed that I bought a LG TVto save on a few bucks compared to an equal specked one from Samsung.Update: 11/12/2013- The motherboard replaced seemed to be from the 47LM7600 series since the TV name suggests that. However the picture quality is just bearable and I dont want to tinker with it anymore. I am stuck with this TV for a few years now. Will definitely not consider LG anymore.- The smart remote has started giving issues since a few days, the cursor stops showing up quite often and I have to take the batteries out of the remote and snap them back in (They are new batteries).- The GUI has become slower than before after all the firmware updates.Update: 11/30/2013- The TV just blew up. Smoke coming out from behind the TV. Any serious TV buyer please avoid LG TV's.

Right out of the box I had the stand attached and the set in place, with a little help from my son, in less than 15 minutes. The design and non existent frame around the picture screen are fantastic. The picture is great and noticeably better than my 5 year old Samsung 46. I do note a little light bleed in the corners when the screen is dark but this doesn't seem noticeable when viewing a show. I don't use the TV's speakers as I've integrated the set into my home theater set-up. The \"smart\" aspect of the TV is pretty good too. But seriously, with my AppleTV and Sony BluRay player I've got so much to select from now off the net its not like I'm wanting for anything more other than an easy to use browser like I have on my iMac. I suppose that'll come when Apple's true TV hits the shelves. Until then, I'm enjoying astonishingly great 3D both simulated by LG and through my 3D Sony BluRay player - Avatar blew me and everyone watching it away.. I love the fact that the 3D glasses aren't the cumbersome, blinking active type. I can use the one's I seem to always bring back from the movie theater and of course LG supplies 6 pair with the set.

The picture is vibrant, and crystal clear.  I know that some people have complained about blooming on the edges.  And the only time I notice it, is when the set is 1st turned on, and shows the LG logo screen.  But when an actual show is being viewed, I never notice it at all.  Some people don't like the remote, but I've had no real issues with it at all.  I can view the web without a problem.  Although typing is a pain.  But that's true with most remotes.  One day, I'll get a wireless keyboard & mouse for using the web.  But that's not the main reason I bought the set.  I should point out that I have cable, and use a cable remote probably 80% of the time.  But I do watch some Netflix, and surf the web a little, so I do have some experience with the LG remote. I guess if I had a choice, I'd have gone with a more conventional remote, but it doesn't bother me.  I also really like the small bezel around the screen.  The TV overall is actually smaller than the 50 inch set that it replaced.3-D is really good if you have a good 3-D movie.  While I do notice the screen is darker when I 1st put on my glasses, that goes away in seconds.  Passive 3-D is one of the main reasons I bought this set.  I didn't want heavy glasses that need to be recharged.  From what I've read on-line, the battery operated glasses and the sets that use them have a brighter picture.  But to me, the hassle wasn't worth the slight difference in image quality.  Maybe if 3-D was what I watched all the time, then it might make a difference, but for just occasional 3-D viewing, the passive system is much better to me.  I tried the 2-D to 3-D conversion, and while it does give a little 3-D effect, it's pretty useless to me, and is nowhere as good as the actual 3-D.As far as setup, I did have to play with the picture settings to get better blacks.  I can't tell you what I did, other than to experiment till I got a picture I liked.  I believe some other reviews go into greater detail about how to calibrate the set.  I will say that this set doesn't have the \"Soap Opera\" effect that some people complain about.  My son has a 60\" Sharp that has this effect.

I spent a lot of time researching and reading reviews on the web.  We spent time at more than one store evaluating quite a few HDTV's and deciding what looked best to us.  Set up was easy and took only a few minutes.  We used HDMI cables to Connect to our new HD cable box and new blu-ray disk player.  We connected to our old VCR/CD player with RCA cables and wirelessly to our home computer network.  It only took a few minutes to upgrade the system firmware via the internet and reboot the system.  The Magic Remote took a little getting used to but it was not long before we used the remote to label the inputs with the names of the appropriate devices and use the virtual keyboard to access the web.  We are considering installing a sound system, but cannot really fault the built in speakers while we shop.  We have tried a few of the free APPs and are still becoming acquainted with the multimedia device that has replaced our old CRT Television.  LG provides many screens and opportunities to fine tune the picture and sound, but we only spent a few minutes picking our preferences and the rest of the time enjoying the in-home theater experience.  I find nothing lacking and cannot imagine being more pleased with any other HDTV on the market.  I will update this review as we learn more about this HDTV.We purchased our TV at Amazon and I took time off from work to be home for the delivery as required.  It was getting close to the delivery time and I had not heard anything from the delivery service.  I checked on line for the status of the delivery and the Amazon web page listed a number to call for the delivery vendor they use in our area.  There was some confusion about our delivery and the delivery service was not sure they could deliver it on the day we expected.  I spoke with the local manager of the delivery service and he made a special trip to ensure I would not have to wait or take another personal day off from work.

It's true even with this TV, however the flashlight effect around the edges isn't enough to bother me in a dark room with this TV. I don't worry about picture burn or the room getting really hot.The 3D experience is very nice. I like that the 3rd dimension is adjustable and can pop-out more/less according to your setting. The resolution looks great with the passive 3D. Even the movie theater 3D glasses work. The 2D to 3D is neat, it adds depth, but isn't significant..The TV resolution is excellent as one would expect. Plenty of options to adjust the picture. The contrast ratio is higher than many tvs in it's class.The sound is decent at best.

I researched about 3 months  thanks Amazomn reviewers) but I found few that addressed the 3D capabilities of this machine. Also I was \"sure\" I'd buy another Sony anyway but this one won out, thank goodness. I'll skip all the kudos given for picture, setup, etc  -- I wanted this for the 3D capabilities. In a word, this TV is genius. The 2D to 3D is instant, easy and so great! Works on old movies, regular TV, even old VHS tapes (!!!) I am watching all the classic 2D movies in 3D and I can hardly tell the difference from those made in 3D which I also have. IE, \"Air Force,\" a B&W; bomber movie made during WWII: the fighters come fast in 3D from great differences, the interior of the bomber is incredible, the flybys in 3D are awesome, like being there. Then there's 'Pearl Harbor' (OMG!!!) James Bond, 'Star Wars' and 'El Cid' -- going through the whole library. \"Ben Hur\" and \"The Alamo\" will be Christmas treats. 3D movies of course are a treat, but most have not been as good as the classics taken to 3D with the press of a button.I felt Blue-Ray DVDs work best for the most dramatic 2D to 2D conversion, but last night we ran El Cid in humble 60hz, regular DVD, and it blew me away. Honestly even the older B&W; movies are great in 3D.No side effects from this passive 3D system either; no dizziness or other silliness peoplke have reported. Its a ll fantastic. And no appreciable \"darkening\" of the TV image from the glassess; maybe a little but if you are seeing those vast scenics in your old Westerns and stuff you wont much notice, hardly worth mentioning. I care little for converting intimate little dramas or sitcoms and stuff. But I've tried it on several, and even football, and it's all great. My tastes run to the epics, sci-fi, and classics and this machine is simply a whole new world of entertainment.3D happens with a single button the remote, which is again sheer genius.

I've used both Ethernet and WiFi with no problems.\"LG Apps\" - I've never used them except for Facebook app which is quite nice, you can choose which user to log-in (passwords are remembered- no need to re-enter them), I also like the YouTube app, not bad, I usually get some buffering but not all the time - the only thing I don't like is the interface and it doesn't remember your YouTube account. The rest of the apps are okay too. The things that I don't see worth while are the 3D world page and the LG store(pay for a bunch of crap apps and games).\"3D conversion\" is another great feature - at first I thought you can only watch 3D IF you have a 3D movie/Blu-ray player. I'm wrong, this can actually convert any playable movie into 3D and I've tested a few 1080p video/movies I have downloaded and they look stunning on 3D mode.\"DUAL-PLAY\" - is another feature that lets you play/view split screen games to a full screen display for each player using a special 3D glasses. - great if your into 2 player coop/multi-player games, but the full screen won't give you HD.COMPATIBILITY:Wow! This TV can play different kinds of video formats .AVI .MP4 including .MKV - another great feature BTW :) it also plays/view slideshow of images thru a network or a USB device.External HDD and USB drives are also supported, as it recognizes file systems like FAT32 and NTFS(which some players/consoles dont) - I think it can recognize 5 partitions and up to 1TB(which I currently am using - maybe more).USB Wireless Keyboard (Built-in TouchPad) also works - I use it for the TV's built in browser, which is also good for searching and the trackpad works like a mouse on the TV as well.

I also purchased some LG AG-F310DP Cinema Dual Play Gaming 3D Glasses, it's OK, you get a full screen dual play option from these glasses but they're not fully HD and sometimes you still get to notice the other player on your screen, noticeable but not that bad.OVERALL:I must say that I'm pretty impressed and satisfied with my purchase and how I'm able to use it's great features as well.

The Lg passive hdtv solved that problem. plenty of free glasses, nobody complaining, and in fact they went out and bought LG's for themselves. We moved to another home and decided to purchase a LG 55LM7600 for our front room. The picture was excellent, 3D was excellent as expected. The two things we didn't like was not having the normal remote but slim curved remote. It worked fine but not the kind we are used to but we are getting used to it. The second think most disturbing was after a firmware upgrade the sound went to pot. Where we normally turn volume up to 15 we now have to turn up to 85. This isn't just cable but bluray player, on anything, sound wasn't right. Three calls to LG.and cable help solved nothing. The menu has a sound check and it was fine. Isolating each devise, swapping cables, was disappointing. Back to Lg and basically no help. Checking on AVforum it seems others are having same sound problem after firmware upgrade. My next step is to have a LG rep come out and see what we are dealing with. It shouldn't be!  Its still under 1 year warranty but we just missed Amazon return date.

I do know the screenis a little more glossy then my old outdated Sony, but it will pick up roon reflectionsif the scene is very dark.  Adjusted the room lighting ever so slightly and curedthe refectivity issues I found annoying.ESPN is full 3D on my Direct TV sat system.  This 3D channel is awesome,akin to having good seats akin to being there in person.  A modern marvelthat's will probably spread to all channels in the future.Having 4 HDMI inputs makes the wiring a lot less complicated.Make sure have the latest HDMI cables that support 3D.  I ordereda new one from Amazon, but ran the older HDMI cable bought in 2005with a mighty fine picture anyone would be proud of.If Amazon comes thru on their low price guarantee? ...so much the better.I will update this review if, and when they do?I would recommend this TV to friends and the world with completeconfidence. No one will feel like they got burnt with this LG 3D TV.UPDATE on REFUND:OK, this I why I prefer dealing with Amazon.  They do business right withzero greif to the customer.  After I saw the updated lower price, I contactedAmazon, and the $90 difference is being refunded.  Low price match guaranteeis for real with folks at Amazon.  I live in the boonies, 40 to 60 milesaway from any large big box stores and use the Amazon Prime for fast fast/nocost, or free shipping too.  I appreciate Amazon living up to their words!Now, I that I have the 90 bucks coming back, a Blu Ray 3D player is nexton the list to purchase from Amazon!", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT BUY-GREAT TV!

This was free scheduled delivery (scheduled it to arrive when I moved into a new place), put together and turned on to be sure it wasn't broken during delivery, and the box taken away.  Couldn't ask for better service.The TV itself is great.  I was worried about light bleeding and ghosting, which is on a number of reviews, and really why I ordered the 2 year old version of this TV instead of this years model.  So thanks to the reviews that said software fixes seems to have fixed some of those problems.At times, for some shows, I see some light bleeding in the four corners of the TV.  But it probably takes up a half inch in width, and 1-2 inches in height.  And the bleeding is not that severe.  So for the size of the TV I only notice it because I know to look for it.  Does not impact the picture.  Its odd that it is only for some channels/shows, so I wonder if this could still be tweaked on the software side.The \"magic remote\" is a bit odd.  There is a scroll bar that would make sense to use to change inputs, which it does.  It just only changes the input off of cable, not to the HDMI inputs (the XBOX and DVD player).  So to change inputs I have to go to the app button, move the wand for an arrow to mouse over the inputs, select that, then change the input.  But I'm OK with that.  For the most part I use my cable copmanies remote anyway.Mainly wanted to write a review to let others know that I ordered a TV this size with no delivery hiccups, no damaged product, and everything works great!

All my previous LEDs and LCDs have been Samsung.But I decided to pull the trigger on the beast for the price, 4 HDMI outputs, the reviews, and the 6 included glasses.And now I'm a very happy customer.Out of the box, it is easy to set up. Had the whole shindig up and running within 15 minutes.An ethernet cable can be inserted (or wireless if you prefer) in the back - it runs well with the browser. However, perhaps it's due to the single core nature of the beast, but it occasionally lags when it goes to the menu options or through the internet. Perhaps the dual core model will beef it up. In any case, that's not why I bought the TV.The 3D is simply amazing - while the 2D to 3D conversion isn't perfect - it gets the job done for the most part. Very cool feature. ESPN 3D here we come! Movies in 3D look great. However ...It's time to end with the reason I could only give it 4 stars. You will definitely need to configure your settings to ensure a better picture. Due to the size and the screen, there is definitely some glare so beware - depending on the scene or the lighting in your room, you can see your reflection. Furthermore, with dark scenes, it is hard to resolve the images - so that can be annoying.

The price point was great during the Memorial Day sale.People complain about the magic remote, but I have gotten used to it, but I also have the TV tied to my directTV remote as well. Obviously, the speakers are terrible, but that is the case with all Flat screen TV\"s. I will be getting a sound bar and system to pair with this sometime this year.The 2D to 3D conversion is a neat little gimmick, but not something you would use that often. THe actually passive 3D is a pretty cool experience, with the only problem being that there are just not that many 3D titles available (at least that I want to see) and you have to buy them, I never see them for rent. I have yet to see Step Up 3D which everyone raves about.The microscopically small bevel is something you only find on TV's with a much higher price tag. It makes the TV extremely sleek looking.The preset color settings are a little off I feel and I do seem to be switching back and forth a lot. However, one aspec I like is that whenever I switch to my HDMI that has my playstation, it automatically switches over to Game mode. The Intelligent sensor is too dark for me and I tend to use the Cinema setting and adjust it slightly.

Not just the image quality, but the hardware itself. The tiny bezel immediately sold me and after reading reviews I knew I wanted it. However I was a bit scared of getting one with the dreaded flashlight effect, but mine does not have that at all. This is one of the reasons I purchased it locally instead of via Amazon, so that I could exchange it much faster and not deal with shipping etc, if needed (luckily I didn't have any problems). The other reason being several local stores were selling it for the same price as Amazon so even with Prime, it was much faster to just buy locally (patience is not a virtue of mine).The image quality it outstanding and the tiny bezel really makes the picture pop. It just looks like it's floating in mid-air. Absolutely love it.I didn't know anything about how the \"magic\" remote actually worked, reviews here seem mixed, but I really like it. It's like a mouse for your computer but it doesn't matter where you point, or if it's pointing down, up, whatever - it still works, and being able to recenter it by shaking it is a nice touch. Entering in text is much faster than other typical methods too (e.g. on PS3 or Xbox, having to press left/right/down/etc to get to each character - this is much faster than that).I've seen a few 3D movies and they don't really do anything for me, but wow, 3D games on the PS3 are insane! Currently I only have a few games that support 3D (WipEout HD, Motorstorm 3D Rift, and Uncharted 3) but the 3D adds a lot to the experience - especially racing games. Super super fun!I appreciate that the set comes with 6 sets of glasses. Not that I have many \"TV parties\" but that has been a sticking point it seems since 3D TV's came out, that they typically only came with one or two pairs and extra pairs were super expensive. So it's nice that they include this many sets of glasses. And I like that they're passive instead of active so you never have to worry about batteries or resyncing. The glasses look pretty dorky but whatever :PHaving wifi built in along with some streaming apps is great. I was thinking about buying a Roku recently but now with this there is no need, since Netflix is built right in. I do wish they had Amazon Instant Video, previous LG models did, not sure why this one doesn't but not the hugest deal in the world since my PS3 can play it.The internet browser is kind of slow but I don't care about that really, I've never spent much time with the browser in the PS3 so not planning to use this one much either. However it's nice to know it's there in case I do want to use it.What I also like is if you're watching TV or something from another device (PS3 etc) [basically anything other than streaming video on the TV itself], you can still use the LG menu system to do other things and it keeps the show you're watching in a \"picture in picture\" window in the top left corner. It's just a nice touch. Unfortunately it doesn't work the streaming apps built in though (e.g. Netflix). If you want to use the menu system, it completely exits out. Not a huge deal but once you get used to it working fine with TV and PS3 etc, it's slightly annoying.The only real complaint I have is with the 240hz - I really hate the effect this has on video, particularly movies. I knew this before I bought it, as I've seen it on other people's TV's, but I thought if I turned it off it would stay off. However it seems like whenever you change any other settings related to video (e.g. brightness), it always gets turned back on so then I have to go turn it off again, which takes about 5 clicks through the menus. I wish there was a way to turn it off permanently because I absolutely hate it and will never want to use it. But now that I have the TV calibrated to just how I like it, I don't expect that to be an issue very often going forward.Overall, I completely love this TV!", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Successfully turned off Soap Opera Effect!!", "Author": "Honest Reviewer", "ReviewID": "RNKZBC236CN8M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I almost returned this TV because I couldn't get rid of the soap opera effect even after turning off Trumotion, and updating SW to 04.02.85.

However, you can still readjust your colors and picture settings to your liking within game mode.  Now I can keep this TV!  Color is so crisp and clear and beautiful!  I guess all new TVs that are 120Hz or greater will have the soap opera effect.

Sharp's for that price tend to be on the lower end, and Panasonics at that price range have refresh rates that don't go above 60Hz, so that eliminated that.It came down to Samsung and LG, with Samsung being more expensive but having a reputation of having better image quality. Ultimately, what made me go for LG is the following:- slim frame, looks good even when the TV is off- passive 3D, meaning no batteries or bulky glasses for the 3D and even 'real 3D' movie theater glasses work on the tv- magic remote -  if you have a wii, you will feel right at home - the samsung remote also got terrible reviews as did the samsung voice activation which was also an important factorIn the end, I bought at a store as it had become back ordered on amazon and was impressed by the skinny box. The tv was easy to install in the foot stand and I had the tv up and running in a matter of minutes.Like other reviewers have pointed out, the colors and picture quality are probably not as good as the samsung, though for my intents and purposes, it is still a marked improvement over my prior set up, so I am willing to live with slightly inferior picture quality especially considering the above mentioned factors. The 3D works incredibly well with 3D content (2D to 3D is, like others have stated, really a gimmick though my wife appears to really enjoy it!). The remote works great though. People comment on the fact that the pointer tends to not be centered. The trick here is that the pointer will always be on screen whereas you can move the remote wildly to one side or the other and the pointer will still remain on screen, and this is when the pointer will not be centered anymore. Remember there is no infra-red bar like the wii or the kinect, so this pointer works purely based on motion detection. You can therefore reset the pointer by moving away from the center and trying to align the remote with the pointer as you do so.The speakers are, like others have said, adequate but not great - they sound kind of flat, and the internet works well though I haven't really used it much as of yet. I have also noticed minor, and hardly noticeable bleeding from the corners, but all in all, I am thrilled with this TV and couldn't be happier.At the end of the day, it will come down to your preferences, and you will have to make compromises unless you go all out. If you cannot compromise on picture quality (meaning mostly color brightness and contrast, as the definition is the same) I would go with Samsung, but the 3D glasses, and the remote/voice activation issues in the end made me decide on this TV.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "best tv out there", "Author": "dennis", "ReviewID": "R3V36WAE5DC5B3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great tv. everything came in perfect condition in a couple days and has been great.

A single piece of glass enclosed by metal frame, I really like it. The bezel is not as thin as the advertising picture shows, however it is still very thin. Overall, it looks cool.Picture qualityNormal. This is not a super IPS computer monitor, nor a full-array LED. So I didn't expect superior PQ when I bought it. I shall say, some light leaking as all edge-lit LED TVs. Color can be tuned to be comfortable. Good enough for daily TV usage. Neither good nor bad surprise here.ConnectivityAll you need are there: usb, hdmi, vga, component and cable. Easy to select input using the TV's control menu. Build-in WIFI and DLNA compliant. I can play video directly from my smartphone to the TV. Also, the TV can play videos from my PC via Wifi. That's cool. With internet connection, all the web-based media sites are available. Also, LG provided some 3D content online you can easily access.3DI choose LG mainly because its passive 3D technology. Basically, each horizontal line of the TV has a polar filter so with polar glasses, one eye can only see half of the pixels. The most attractive advantage of passive 3D is that the glasses are simple polar filter glasses: they are cheap, light, no battery needed, no synchronization needed. The TV comes with 6 pairs of glasses and I get another 6 pair for free. So I can hold party or enjoy 3D movies with my whole family and friends together. Also, the TV support many 3D inputs: side-by-side, up-and-down, checker-board... all the format you can think of. And you just tell the TV which format it is and the TV will automatically convert the input into the scan-line mode 3D so you can enjoy with the TV. That was so easy. With such function, you don't have to have a 3D blue-ray player to play 3D movies, just hook it to your computer and play full screen side-by-side videos, press the \"3D\" button of the TV remote, and the TV will show the 3D stuff right to your eyes. That works so well and I really like it. The 3D quality is just breath-taking! I totally believe this passive technology will be the future. Because it is simple, cheap, and it works very well. Someone may argue that this passive technology actually lose half of the resolution. However, when I watch it from the right distance, I feel the picture quality is just as good. Passive 3D actually uses space to encode the left and right image while the active shutter 3D use time to encode the 2 pictures. So the active 3D instead loses the time resolution. So at the end, no big difference. Most importantly, passive 3D won't have any synchronization problem.Other thoughtsAnother surprise is the TV runs very cool. Not like other TV's or my computer monitor which after a while, you can feel the heat coming out on the top. This TV is totally cool. Only the bottom you can feel warm. That's it!The wii-like remote is fun to use. It actually makes the pushing button operation much easier for on-screen menus. That's a plus. And it also make it possible to keep only very few keys on the remote so the remote is small and light.Cons:one useless feature is the green-mode or energy-saving mode. This mode makes the picture too dark to see because in this mode, the back-light is turned down to save energy. In the meantime, the brightness and contrast are all down with the back-light and I can't stand it. I simply turned the green-mode off.As mentioned by another buyer, the youtube app in this LG tv really sucks! I don't know it is LG's problem or google's problem. But for any HD video, the audio is either totally messed up or with very huge lag!!

So over the past 2 years as I was contemplating the move first to a plasma, and more recently to an LED, I have read every review, checked spec's, features, inputs, and outputs.  I decided to go with the 47LM7600 for a several reasons. The most important being picture quality. The other reasons included the magic remote, slim bezel, and the low cost of passive 3d.Pros:Awesome Picture!Beautiful TV with thin Bezel, I would call it the iphone4 of TV's style wise.Easy SetupCons:Changing inputsSmart TV appsNetflix sluggishnessOnce the TV is set up and the picture is calibrated, there is no flashlighting. Initially out of the box there was minimal amounts along the top and bottom of the screen, but it disappeared after calibration. I found the Trumotion to be too much for most viewing, and will try it with some sports programming, but otherwise it remains off.My biggest issue has been the input selection, having to click at least 3 or 4 times to change an input is too much. Also, being able to hide inputs on the input screen would have been helpful as well, I have no need for the general TV input, and it pushes hdmi #3 and #4 to a second page. Also renaming the inputs would have been helpful as well, as you can only rename them to generic defaults.Another issue with the remote is that if it moves, the curser and info bar pop up on the screen and stay for about 5 seconds. It would have been nice if this could be adjusted, or if the info bar was black it wouldn't be such an eyesore when it pops up in a movie, because it is limited to the black bar at the top in a widescreen movie.The Netflix App is slow, and crashes constantly, but not worth removing a star for. I just use the PS3 for Netflix instead. Like I said, I bought the TV for image quality, not its apps.So overall, this TV does what I expected it to do, and it does it well.

Rabideau \"MadMojo\"", "ReviewID": "RIHIOCX5Z1RNS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I loved this television from the moment I turned it on for the first time. The image was amazing and it displayed my favorite demo content to a level of detail and clarity that I've never seen on another television. After a few days I noticed oddities in the display (usually due to different lighting conditions for my place at different times of day) so I began to tweak settings to fix them and the television became even better once I had the right settings.WARNING: Certain settings this television has on by default will effect your image quality in a negative manner and I have no idea why they were set that way as default except for perhaps display in a retail outlet. Read the manual and play with settings to get the best picture quality. The backlighting can make the blacks look grey during certain low-light situations, but an option fixes it so the blacks turn very black and look amazing. Different picture modes have color manipulation that doesn't need to be there. Who cares if I'm watching a movie or \"Cinema\"? I don't need the colors and whites to look shaded with an orange sunlight tint. *lol* Also there's a power/energy saver option which can dim your whole display to a nearly unwatchable state with the default settings. Adjust this to your liking if you're really concerned about saving energy, but I recommend you turn it off completely for best image quality.Also, many people don't like the ClearPlus settings when they first start watching because it makes everything a little too real. Someone as old as I am has been accustomed to watching blurry and bland television and film and so it can come as a shock to have those settings turned on. But if you give it a chance and force yourself to get used to it, then the extra clarity, detail, and realistic look to film and television becomes so much more immersive. It's almost like watching 3D without even needing glasses. Give it a chance and I think you'll be hooked. I use it even when playing games, although this can slow down some response times in certain games, so I still switch over to the Game display option to remove it when I notice it effecting play too much. (Don't forget to adjust image settings in the game mode to those you use in other display options, as well.)Speaking of 3D; I used 2D to 3D, watched the 3D version of Transformers: Dark of the Moon on Blu-Ray, played Gears of War 3 with 3D turned on, and also took advantage of the Dual Play option which was pretty cool. The 2D to 3D is nice, but you'll probably want to adjust your 3D settings to find the best match for your viewing situation. The native 3D content is amazing. I loved watching the Transformers film in 3D and so did my wife. Gears 3 was cool in 3D, but I did notice a VERY slight reduction in resolution when it's turned on. 3D settings needed to be adjusted quite extensively to get that to look proper, unlike the Blu-Ray which just worked and was awesome with the default settings.On the Dual Play, I played Modern Warfare 3 in split screen and turned on the DualPlay 3D functionality which allows you to view split-screen content as full screen for both players. (You can buy special glasses, or just get an extra pair of glasses and switch the lenses around. There are videos on YouTube about how to DiY this to save some money.) Because this option turns an image that has been shoved down to a half area of the screen into full screen there is some distortion to the display you're viewing. But the difference of not seeing the other player's screen and viewing your own on the entire viewing area is well worth that cost.Also, I have to say yet again that I have no idea why anyone would go for a TV with Active 3D. The passive 3D on this television is amazing and very inexpensive with no batteries required and better viewing experience. (You can even nab ones from the theater to use at home.) With these glasses you can tilt your head and still see 3D just fine. And, again, no expensive glasses or batteries to change out!! =)Overall, this television is amazing and my only regret is that I didn't get a slightly larger version for my viewing space. (I purchased the 47\" and a 50\" probably would've worked better, but is still out of my price range at the moment.) I'm going into my second week with the television at the writing of this review. I'll update this review in a few months, if I have any issues or other things to note.Sixth-Month Update:The power supply on my television apparently died. I was on the phone with tech support (someone from India most-likely, but no language conflict issues experienced) and was directed to wait for a phone call to have an on-site repair done during the next week. I'm still waiting for them to call me (although mine has apparently been escalated and I'll be getting a call within the next several days or early next week) and it has me slightly frustrated an irritated.When the television was working I loved it, though. Aside from the recent issue of the television dying it had an amazing image the entire life of the TV. I'm hoping it was an isolated incident, probably having more to do with several recent power outtages (that did not occur near the time of the failure, but probably contributed to it) than any defective piece of hardware. That is just my hope, though.I do have to say I absolutely hate the fact that the TV can detect when a new input device is turned on, but that it will not automatically switch over to that new input. Even when I turn off every other input to the television, it still waits for me to click on an on-screen button saying \"Yes\" to changing to the new input/device. This is just silly. And considering I don't like having to waggle the magic remote to wake it up, and then point it at the button to select it; it's pretty irritating. But I've heard you can buy a separate remote to use instead of the magic remote that'll put input switching to the touch of a button. (Less than $10.) So I'll probably just nab one of those soon and then it won't matter anymore. The image is so amazing I can forgive this minor issue. As long as my in-warranty on-site repair is performed to satisfaction. I'm still waiting and will give another update to this review after it takes place.9-Month Update:So, now I've had several repairs over the last three months and I was forced to talk with LG Support in order to have a decision made about what they are going to do with the television. I've been told either they will send me a new TV or provide me with a refund. The local repair company who worked on my TV did an amazing job with communication and completing repairs in a timely manner. But now that I've had to actually deal with LG's support I'm getting extremely irritated. I've been forced to drop a star from my rating because of their lack of decent support. When I get someone on the phone to talk with, they give me instructions on what to do (which has been sending them a piece of information by email) and then I'm supposed to wait around a week to get a response. The first time this happened, it seemed simple. I sent them the email, expected the issue to be handled and to hear from them the next week, and then I'd be done with the issue and be happy. Instead, I was told a week later they needed more information. And that I would need to wait a week again for yet another reply. Then I was told that the information I sent was in the wrong format, so they needed me to convert it into a file format that they required (but did not inform me was a requirement) in order to wait yet another week for a response. Then I started being told that I should probably call back within 24-48 hours to make certain there were no problems, instead of waiting a week for them to contact me. When I do that, I'm told that it's gone to the correct department now and that I simply need to wait up to 10 business days for someone to contact me with their decision about what they are going to do with the TV. I've literally had nothing but problems and repairs with this TV for the last 4+ months and sent them every bit of information they demanded, despite them having this information from the first repair in the first place. Their support services are completely insane and I don't think I'll ever buy a television from them again considering this horrible experience.I still think the TV is a good tv, but I've had an extremely negative experience overall with LG support. I've been left for months with a broken television because of their lack of decent support for known defect issues, and their exceedingly slow support services. I now have to recommend that even with an extended warranty on the product, you should avoid the 47LM7600 model entirely. It has known hardware issues and dealing with support from LG is a complete nightmare. I only dropped it down to 4 stars, because I still like the TV (when it's working properly) and I'm not clear on the percentages regarding hardware failure for their TVs. It wouldn't be fair to drop it lower, because other buyer's might not have the problems I experienced. Avoid LG support at all costs, and avoid 47LM7600 model. It has a lot of issues you'll need to deal with LG support on and it's just not worth it.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "I was a little worried, but.....", "Author": "Stephen A.

True Motion 240hz is exceptional for sports and gaming.  I even like the 2D-3D.  It's better than I thought it would be, as I didn't really purchase this TV for the 3D effects.

I found this television on Amazon and could not resist ordering it.  When I got it, it was very easy to put on it's stand (four screws in the back of the tv, and four screws on the base).  The hook ups are very easy, most of which are HDMI (4), I was also quite surprised to find out that it also had a computer VGI hookup in the back so I could hook my computer up to the TV as well.The picture when watching blue ray discs is CRYSTAL clear.  I have only actually seen a clearer picture a few times on other tv's.  The only slight problem I had was with playing video games on the tv as there was a slight lag between when you use the controller and when your character does the action on the screen.  This was easily corrected by going into the settings and changing the settings to game mode (video game systems are designed to run on 60 HZ anything over that causes too much processing and causes lag in controls and this tv has 240 Hz).  After I corrected this (which was very easy to do) everyting ran smoothly.  The 3D works very well as well and it uses passive 3D glasses (the same ones you get in the movies).All in all, I rate this television a 5 star television and highly recommend it.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fan....tastic.", "Author": "Diamonds", "ReviewID": "R1ALS0VS88V931", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the greatest TV I have ever owned.  I don't want to swoon too much, because I really love it.... so I'll just try and keep it short, starting with aesthetics of the TV, which are great on or off, mainly because of the thin bezel (edge of the TV) that just really makes it look like you're watching a window to entertainment, rather than a TV.  This is especially true at night.For picture quality, you really can't do much better, especially for the price range.  There are plenty of features to tweak to make sure you have the right settings for you (you may want to start with the automatic picture calibration though).  And if you have different devices, it will save your picture settings and automatically switch to them when you go to that input (HDMI 1, HDMI 2, for example).  One thing that you might have to tinker with a bit is the smooth motion technology.  It's simply just not good for everything.  If you're watching Sports, reality TV (or anything that isn't fiction based, like news), or playing [some] video games... it's a pretty cool feature to have, but if you're watching anything cinematic or fictitious (like TV shows or movies), you'll most likely want it off, as it gives the picture what's called the \"Soap-Opera effect\", and it's extremely noticeable.  It basically takes away all the blur and other tricks that filmmakers would add in to make something look more cinematic and appealing to the eye, and it actually makes things look unrealistic at times.The Smart remote takes some getting used to (it basically works like a Wiimote) but is a feature I'm really glad to have, it works really well with the menu system, which LG did a really great job with.  I wish some of the menus were a little more customizable, but aesthetically and functionally they get the job done.  There isn't too many interesting apps available on the TV, but really the TV comes preloaded with most of the stuff that you'd want to use anyway such as Netlix, Hulu+, and Youtube (which has some really great integration if you have a tablet or smart phone).  You can browse the internet as well, so I imagine the remote will be good for that, but then you still don't have a keyboard (though there is a smart phone app, free I believe).  I have a computer in the same room as the TV, so I don't really use the internet feature.Something to add in for media freaks is that this TV has plenty of built in codecs so that if you have a lot of videos stored on your computer, the TV should have on problem playing them (either over the built in wireless connection, or through one of the USB ports) without having to convert the files.  I even got the TV to play MKV files, so it's very convenient for that.Extremely happy with this purchase, and it's going to be difficult to find something to replace it... unless it's just a larger version of this.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture", "Author": "ikenny", "ReviewID": "R3DPUW2NPLNUSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this TV for a couple of weeks.

I made an adjustment to the sound and now I think it looks about right, but I am wondering why I needed to make an adjustment in the first place.  Was there a problem with the TV?

Fantastic. Screen is less reflective than most competitors that I've seen, which distorts the image less from ambient light. There is a visible halo around the edge of the screen in darker movie scenes, but all of the reviews I've read on Samsung also have this problem. Inputs are easy to access although component cables must be attached via an adapter and may cause a bit of bunching behind low-profile wall mounts. The 3D seems to work very well. I've heard that the passive glasses do not produce quite the results that the active 3D systems do, but the effect is on par with, if not better than, what I've seen in theaters, so it's worth the cost difference to me. While I like the magic remote, there are a few quirks that cause problems. If you're sitting in a rocking chair, the chair's movement will cause the on-screen arrow to activate, interrupting whatever you're watching. It seems to function based solely off of the remote's movement, rather than using the TV as a reference point, as the Wii's sensor bar does, meaning that the remote will activate and move the on-screen arrow no matter what direction the remote is pointing. The click wheel also serves as channel up/down, which is a bit too easy to press. I like the remote for some applications, but it would have been nice if a standard remote had been included as well.

No back lite bleeding, sharp, crisp, literally looks like a window into the movie set. I will say grey scenes looked a little pixelated until I tweaked the pic settings a bit.Duel Play and 3DWhen I first got this TV, I noticed that I couldn't stream content directly off the browser. Did some research and found out this thing only had flash 8.0 on it. Very disappointing considering streaming movies etc takes flash 10.0 or higher. Thank goodness LG has blessed us with a few major updates in the past month that has fixed this issue. Go LG!!! I play Xbox Live on this set and it handles it beautifully. I ordered the duel play glasses, and I must say it is amazing!!! It really works! And works very well. 2 player split screen on Black Ops 2 with duel play you can really only see your own screen on the whole TV! Awesome Stuff! When I first tried it I was sitting too close and thought it was crap while a buddy sat an extra few feet away from the TV saying how cool it was. I stepped back and realized I was too close causing a major ghosting effect. Games you play that aren't duel play compatible can still do it, but aren't as natural with the effect. Some you slightly lose some of the screen in the corners or it causes a slight fish bowl effect. Regular 3D is very good. Pops right out in your face. Have to remind yourself not to duck. 2D to 3D is decent but actual 3D is way better.Magic RemoteI love the magic remote. It takes a little getting use to but once you do, you'll find yourself navigating your TV and apps faster than ever. Even my Xfinity cable box can be completely controlled by it. (Via HDMI). I think it could probably use an info button on the remote but you only have to click twice to get there so no big deal compared to how much time it saves you in the long run.USB and HDMI connectionsI hooked up a 1 TB (1000gig) WD desktop external hard drive to the TV through 1 of the USB ports and BAMM! Watching all my movies, videos, and pix right on the TV. As well as listening to all my music. There is also an app in Google store call media share that can connect any of your mobile devices (phone, tablet, etc) on your wireless network. Comes in handy showing your family a slide show of pix off your phone and playing music from your phone at the same time if preferred.The One Bad ThingOk . I do love this TV. It is my first smart TV and I think it's amazing, BUT, the one bad thing I've experienced with this set is that sometimes I have to turn it off and back on to get it to recognize my devices when switching HDMI's. Example: from cable box to Xbox or computer and vice versa. It's a little frustrating at times considering this thing's not exactly cheap. Idk if it's just a model defect or just my particular set. Probably the latter. But it has been like that since day one. That being said I do still love this TV. I will contact LG and see if there is a remedy.Because of the one HDMI defect I'm giving this TV a 4 out of 5 star review. If the problem is fixed, (maybe a miracle software update) , I will add the 5th star to this review. I still recommend this TV assuming that it was a freak defect in my set.Thanks for reading and good luck", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "bleeds light from corners", "Author": "satishpv", "ReviewID": "R1EXSOFGZH3JH2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The quality of the tv is good, but bleeds light badly upto 10 inches from the corners.

My wife loved the TV and this is considering we still have her 32 inch cathode ray tube TV which worked well. But this TV has an amazing picture, color rendition is great as we are both artists. The internet features really make this TV stand out. The remote wand really is easier to use, as you just point to the screen. One thing is the pointer turns off too soon, before you have finished making  selections. However, that could be changed in future software updates.

I haven't played with the 3d a whole lot yet(mostly battlefield for the 360) but its good I bet it's awesome on movie meant for 3d. If your into gaming and play with friends on split screen you can buy a pair of glasses called the dual gaming glasses(20 bucks or less) and use a special screen feature that allows you to play split screen and ONLY SEE YOUR SCREEN!!! So no screen looking.  And it(from my understanding: via the LG website)allows both players to utilize THE ENTIRE 55 inches of screen. Don't quote me check out the lg website under tv accessories. Anyways the sound is very good another feature I like is if your watching tv and you turn another device on ie: Xbox, blue ray player, what have you it gives a prompt to switch to that input. So no going to the home button clicking on input and then selecting your input. I like the fact that it has a wireless router and a LAN plug my wireless router is right behind tv so I just plug it in for a faster connection. The magic remote functions like a wii remote, if you don't like it that way you can turn it off. It's a very simple remote with only 13 buttons and a roller wheel (I posted a picture of it)I think I covered everything. I will update post when I watch a true 3d movie. Oh last thing the people who make the Real 3D movies in the theater make the 3D for LG. in fact if you \"forget\" to put your glasses back in the bin, if they're polarized say from an IMAX they look REALLY Good so I've been told the closest IMAX is an hour and a half away(don't care that much)", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phenominal TV", "Author": "Ed5781", "ReviewID": "R2WRU8MVX2I7BA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for 5 days now.

Amazing right out of the box.Easy to setup and stand - probably took 45mins or so to understand and assemble.Picture quality is excellent, with little or no light bleeding (top left) - visible only when viewing dark scenes at night with no ambient lights - chances are this is a rare occurence. Just ensure you use HDMI cables to connect STB.The best part - no borders..its all screen real estate in the front!2D to 3D conversion is stunning as well. I watched Discovery's frozen planet in converted 3D and could feel the polar bear in the room! Real 3D is cinema like as well (just make sure to set it to Cinema in 3D settings). No dizziness or discomfort to the eyes.Coming to the LG remote - just love it. It may seem unusual in the beginning but if you've played Wii it won't take much time to get used to it.Played 720p HD movies from laptop over wireless - no buffering or breaks. 1080p over wireless did cause some buffering.Sound from the speakers is good as well.

The network compatibility is nice - very easily detects my PC's media library, and the online features appear to be nice. 2d -> 3d conversion works best with high resolution images/files... as you'd expect. I haven't played with 'real' 3d movies, so I can't comment on that, but, really, that was fluff and nice to have but not a central buying point.The only thing preventing a five star review would be the horrible remote (3/5 stars), and the ambient light feature.Seriously, couldn't this thing have shipped with a more standard remote as well? The only way to change input is by going to the settings and fiddling with the point and click mechanic. Some dedicated buttons would be nice, though I can see why they didn't as well (it's a slim thing, pretty condensed). It's somewhat of a nice wow feature - or would be if the Wii hadn't been released well before it. It's serviceable, but not the best.The ambient light feature (changes brightness based on the light in the room is a great feature - or would be if I could turn it off.

The sound quality is excellent without the home theater system, the remote is more like a mouse and very simple to use; just point & click. Picture quality is brilliant and you can see the screen from different angles without any distortion. And it IS smart; internet streams seamlessly and it is fun to watch YouTube on tv without any hassle. Anyone considering a new TV should consider a smart TV and anyone considering a smart TV should definitely buy this one. You Go LG!!!", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid Value; Beware Viewing Angles", "Author": "Twon-Dexter", "ReviewID": "R3OP1EPLD9MCUI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good TV, solid value, but I'm a bit disappointed in the viewing angles.In retrospect, I probably put too much emphasis on the 3D and smart features when shopping; after just a few days it's becoming clear that I don't care very much about that stuff.  I haven't used the 3D much, and have only used the 2D-3D conversion (haven't used any native 3D content yet).  2D-3D, as others have observed, is surprisingly effective, but my own opinion is that this is probably more of a fun thing to use every once in a while at best-- i.e. it's a gimmick.The same goes for the smart features.  It's nice to have the wifi for the firmware updates, but since I have an XBox, I have no need to use the TV apps.  The XBox gives me everything (Netflix, Youtube) I would want from the smart apps, and stuff the smart apps cannot (Amazon VOD).  Essentially the XBox streaming makes the smart apps a moot feature, and if I didn't have the XBox, many BD players have the same kind of streaming.  If you need it, a Roku or Apple TV will give you plenty of streaming options that a \"smart\" TV won't be able to keep up with, and I should have factored this reality into my own shopping requirements.Even the thinness, which is a real eye-grabber in the store, is pretty irrelevant when the TV sits on a mount in a corner.All this is relevant because it suggests that I really should have shopped for a good, solid 2D TV (e.g. a plasma), rather than one with all the sexy extras.  Thankfully, this TV is pretty good as a regular 2D TV.  The only thing that I'm a bit disappointed in is the viewing angles.  My TV sits in the corner of the room, so no angle is more than 45 degrees off, but even half that to one side or the other makes for a noticeable drop in the brightness and \"pop\" on the image.  It's the same up and down as side-to-side: any deviation from head-on of more than a few steps has noticeable consequences.  This may be just an unavoidable limitation of the LCD technology, but coming from a 5-year-old plasma, I'm feeling a little disappointed about the angles.As for how disappointed, I can only say that I'm not disappointed enough to send it back.  The head-on picture is fantastic, and I've noticed none of the lag issues for gaming that some have reported (mainly Halo, if that makes a difference).  The light bleeding and clouding seems to have gotten the most attention as an issue here, and while I can, under the right conditions, see it happening, when the picture is on, it's really a non-issue for mine.  And the TV looks really great when turned off.  Even if I might do it different if I had it to do over, the problem is not big enough to warrant re-packing and re-shopping.  It will do nicely as it is.Summary:PROS- TV hardware looks great;- Good picture quality from head-on (see cons);- Great price and service from Amazon (price dropped the day after I ordered, and the refund was applied to my credit card 3 days after I called).NON-ISSUES- Light bleeding and clouding there, but practically irrelevant;- Firmware updated easily and quickly via wireless;- TruMotion turned off easily (thus no soap opera effect);- Magic Remote is fine; not great but very usable;- Harmony One controls most functions fineCONS- Limited viewing angles: Clear degradation in brightness and picture \"pop\" when viewed from more than 20 degrees or so off-center;", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV!", "Author": "E.

We watched programs the first night using the default \"Standard\" settings and were really disappointed with the dark, dull picture.  Then, I made two simple changes that I found in other reviews which made the picture nice and bright and the colors \"pop\".  Under the Settings - Picture - change the Energy Savings to \"minimum\" then go to Picture options and set the Local LED Dimming to \"low\".  Those two changes turned me around from wanting to send the set back to wanting to keep it.  Another item worth mentioned is that each input can be adjusted individually, so when you go from your satellite or cable box to your BluRay player you need to make individual settings - but I would start with the energy savings and LED local dimming changes then work from there.About the remote - I do not like it.  If you bump it you get a red arrowhead on the screen that stays for 5 seconds, and if you want to change inputs it is an unnecessarly long process that could be done with a dedicated \"input\" button like on most TV's offered today.  In fact some Samsung's offer a remote with a keyboard built in - a much better idea.Overall, in my opinion, this is an excellent set offered at what I thought was an excellent price.

However, I shortly discovered that this effect seems to be completely eliminated during normal viewing if you use local LED dimming and dynamic contrast in the image settings, and if you're viewing a video signal that is attempting to render black (as opposed to a no-signal screen, where you might still see the bleeding effect).  For example, there's a movie I just bought where one of the opening credit screen has a black background.  Despite the fact that I see notable edge bleeding on this TV with a no-signal screen, the background for those opening credits is dead black, no bleeding or any backlight visible at all.  Presumably the LED local dimming is detecting that the signal is attempting to render black and is turning off the LED backlights in that region.  The resulting image is perfect.First thing you should do after setting up this TV is to go to the video settings and run through the Picture Wizard II.  It greatly improved the image in general.

I have been a long time Sony fan but over the past few years, Samsung has become a lot more prevalent in my household.  I was considering Sony's HX7/HX8 series and Samsungs ES7xxx and ES8xxx series TVs and LG was not even on the map.  After some research I decided i was going to get a Samsung ES7500.  I mentioned to a friend of mine, who works for a local brick and mortar electronics store, that I was in the market and he almost immediately started pushing the LG to me even though I was pretty set on the Samsung.  I humored him and went in to see the TV and I was blown away by his demo.  The picture was fantastic, 3D was very impressive given that I had heard passive 3D was not as good.  To top it all all off he was able to get me that TV at a price that was $200 less than Amazon and even more than that at other physical store.  I bought the TV the next day.Picture and 3DThe picture is good out of the box but downright amazing once dialed in.  Blacks are deep, contrast is excellent and color reproduction is top notch.  There are so many picture settings, that you can lose yourself for days adjusting it to your liking once you get a baseline calibration.  The 3D is very good.  While I have seen sets produce more pronounced 3D than this TV, the effects this set produces are very realistic and believable (you can adjust it for more on 2D-3D content and make it look as silly as you like).  I can honestly say I could not be more pleased with this TVs ability to display 3D and the 2D conversion while occasionally flawed (some things stick out or fade deeper than they should be) with some imagery, it has me using 3D way more than I ever though I would want to as most things look great.  The passive glasses are light, comfortable and can be worn as long as you want without that fatigued, yucky feeling that I get after wearing Active 3D glasses for more than 30 minutes.  If you sit too close, you will notice scanlines (striping) in the picture when watching in 3D but at normal viewing distances it look just fine.There are only two downsides to this set picture wise. One is the TruMotion feature, does not always get things right and you can get artifacting from some fast moving 24fps content.  This disappears if you turn off the TruMotion but I like it enough that I keep it on all the time for watching TV.  The second is there is noticeable light bleed on the edges and some clouding (uneven lighting) on the screen when solid dark colors are displayed.  It's more of a nuisance than anything since it isn't noticeable any other time.  When the TV is adjusted properly, this effect diminishes.SoundNot much to say here as I did not use the internal speakers for more than 5 minutes.  I use optical out to a home Theater system.  I did notice that the ARC feature did not seem to work but it was not much of an issue for me since I prefer to have my cable box, 360, PS3 and Wii U on their own video settings which you can't do when going from receiver to TV.  It also simplified my HTPC connection.FeaturesThis is a feature packed set and I really like the Smart Remote (motion pointer).  It could use a slight redesign to make the buttons work better by feel and a few more buttons for quick selection of inputs would be nice as well.  I was able to overcome this with my Harmony remote but find that it is very useful to keep the LG remote nearby for navigating menus.  The SmartTV features are decent.  Hulu and Netflix work great *though they are slow to start up.  There are a fair number of apps in the store but surprisingly a number of the ones I want don't work on this TV.  Overall I'd say that app support and performance could be better.  The web browser is slow but functional; I don't use it since I have a laptop permanently connected to my TV. If someone were really interested in the apps feature of the TV, they might be better off with the 8600 as it has a much more buff processor than the 7600.DesignThis is a very handsome set.  The stand is gorgeous and really looks like a piece of art.  The real star is the thin bezel that makes the TV look as if the picture is frame-less and video is just floating in space.  It is this feature that made me take the stand off and mount the set on the wall.  This set is fairly thin as well and not very heavy.SummaryOverall, I cannot think of a set that delivers more bag for the buck.  While I got an amazing deal, I would have been proud to have paid more for this wonderful set.

They were very accommodating in helping me on my quest for a panel in this model that worked for me. Regretfully after going through a few I just could not stand the edge bleeding and uneven lighting in the dark screens. I had been waiting 6 months to purchase this TV and love everything about it but that. During the day or in bright rooms it was not all that noticeable but I mostly watch TV/Movies at night and in the dark it was really bad... it washed out the blacks in areas and if there were black bars on a wide screen movie it looked like someone was shining a flashlight from the top and bottom. After going through multiple reviews (here and elsewhere) I saw that this is common not only with this TV but this type of TV in general. I also read some reviews where guys said they went through a few panels and finally found one that had even back lighting but I did not have that luck. Now... let me say this; if you have this TV and love it I think that is awesome. The last thing I want to do is make someone start watching dark movies and looking for flaws. From the reviews it is obvious that many people love this TV and most likely have the ability to watch a show and not look for flaws. That is just not my nature... I have bit of perfectionism (OCD?) regarding new purchases but more important I know what is important to me and what is pleasing to my eye and this TV just didn't cut it. I just installed a Panasonic Plasma P55GT50 and I love it! Picture is flawless... no edge bleeding and blacks are black as night.I am not stating that the Plasma or the Panasonic is a better TV and I am in no way jamming on this TV as I loved everything about it except for what I mentioned above. I just promised a very nice young lady when I was setting up my last exchange (trying to find an even panel) that if it didn't work that I would write a review and post my experience. I also wanted to share my experience so that others who may have a personality like me can use my experience in their decision making process.Hope it helps.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving this TV", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R7BSUEKEVX89Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a great TV. I won't go into an in-depth review but I will point out a few things that are more unique to this display. The color and overall picture quality is outstanding.PROS:-The physical design looks great in your room - best of any 2012 tv on or off.-The smartshare works well. I run a windows server 2003 computer with all my files, and the TV can stream 1080p Bluray files (.mkv) without any stutter or delay (on wireless to boot). You can browse by folder, name, search, etc.-The remote is great for what it is. It is much much better than Wii, and it makes for a fast and usable interface. Navigating menus is much quicker and enjoyable than with standard arrow keys alone. Don't like it? Buy a universal remote ($10-20).-It is AMAZING at upscaling SD content. I have lots of tv shows around 400p and they look surprisingly good on my 47\" from just 8 ft away. I'm comparing to a 40\" Samsung that is 3 years old which made anything that is not 720p or 1080p look like garbage. This alone is a huge plus for me.CONS:-As mentioned by others, shows some signs of flash-lighting, light bleeding, and clouding. There are two things to help with this - 1) calibrate the settings for low backlight, and 2) you can gently wipe the screen with a microfiber cloth and you will notice this can reduce/eliminate the effects in most places. Do it at night while you have a black screen displayed, it is very easy to do.-Remote can be a annoying when, for example, you just want to pause something. Also if you haven't used it for a while it goes to sleep and if you then want to change the volume or mute, the first button press usually doesn't do anything but 'wake' it.-Internet browsing is stupidly slow and almost useless - any site with images or flash or video is very slow. To that effect streaming sites like justin.tv are not viable.Overall, I would definitely recommend this TV.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mine was Perfect for a Bright Room, Unacceptable for a Dark Room", "Author": "edgeh2o", "ReviewID": "R7LX81HUTCKPP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I evaluated this TV for 28 days, trying various settings from AVSForum, CNET, other TV review sites/blogs, Amazon, and the AVS calibration suite myself. In the end, no settings I tried made me satisfied enough to keep the TV, mainly for night time/dark room viewing. Let's do some pros/cons.Pros:TV physically looks AMAZINGPassive 3D worked equally amazing and gives a much better experience compared to activeIn a bright lit room, the picture was wonderful and near perfectRemote was very easy to use and made me wish all TV's had one like itGlare was very minimal, no problem thereDSE very minimalHandled motion very wellCons:Edge bleed in the top 2 corners, as well as the bottom right corner. Extremely distracting in a dark room!There is a very thin strip/band of light along the top of the television that is noticeable when a full/bright picture is displayed. AFAIK, all sets have this. Mine did, many users on AVSForum have it, and the display at the store I went to had it. In fairness, it's only noticeable if you look for it, or it has been pointed out to you.Some video/audio sync when connected to Onkyo TX-SR707 (can be fixed with receiver's controls)Some blurring when streaming Hulu through PCBlacks look grey in a dark roomThe #1 reason I returned this TV was the edge-bleed. This is a panel lottery, it varies on every LED, and many people have received units with very minimal edge-bleed or none at all. It's not noticeable in the daytime, but I'm usually never home in the daytime, and only watch movies at night. It is extremely annoying/distracting/disappointing in a dark room. Most of my favorite movies are dark- Tron, Watchmen, Fountain, Dark City, etc, and I pretty much had to turn on every light in my apartment to mask the edge-bleed in order to make it an acceptable viewing experience. This is, again, the main reason I returned the unit. I could have exchanged it for the same TV and hoped for the best, but I've chosen to wait it out and try something different in the near future, particularly something not edge-lit.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "3D on Demand: An LG Cinema Screen 3D LM7600 55-Inch 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and 3D Glasses Review", "Author": "L. T. Beasimer \"www.LBphoto.net\"", "ReviewID": "R35MLX0LHADWO7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG Cinema Screen 3D LM76 HDTV, assembled in Mexico, is designed to change the way people view TV at home.  Smart TV provides easy access to limitless content such as Hulu and Netscape, PC stored video, and LG provided sources.  The magic remote is easy to use, just point at the TV and click.  LED Plus shows color and black levels like never seen before.  TruMotion 240Hz brings extra sharp detail, even to fast moving scenes.  Plus, 2D to 3D technology creates endless 3D content.Setting up the LG Cinema Screen 3D LM76 HDTV takes some time.  Removing the TV and all the components takes time as its well packed in numerous Styrofoam parts, many with cubby holes for smaller items.  Assembly included a time consuming but simple installation of the stand which slightly rotates the TV from left to right.  The final step is to connect wires to the back of the LG Cinema Screen 3D LM76 HDTV and join to your Wi-Fi network.Initially, I set up the LG Cinema Screen 3D LM76 HDTV without a connection to our satellite system.  The Smart TV functionality allows for locating and viewing content from the internet using a wireless connection or common video files stored on networked devices.  Additionally, we have a PS3 where I can watch additional free content using Amazon Instant Video which isn't currently available on the LG Cinema Screen 3D LM76 HDTV.  Watching recorded television shows from our networked DVR is possible, but I had no ability to fast forward through commercials.The remote works similarly to a Wii controller, and is annoying to use.  Any movement causes the cursor to appear on the screen, even when the remote is lightly jostled when repositioning on the sofa.  Trying to align the controller while pressing buttons can be challenging as the button locations are not ergonomically or intuitively placed.  Using the remote in a darkened room is even more challenging as the buttons are not backlit either. I've gotten familiar with using the remote, but I'd rather not and programmed its functions into my Harmony 1100 programmable remote instead.  However, the LG remote is the simplest method of changing settings and browsing content.An energy saving feature adjusts the screen brightness while watching to compensate for ambient lighting.  Brightness noticeably and quickly changes while watching TV and is disruptive to viewing.  This feature would be less disruptive if the brightness was reset gradually instead.  I also found the automatic settings too dim, so every time the TV reset the brightness, I was readjusting it to a brighter setting.  While the auto brightness sounds like a good idea, this is one feature I could do without.The LG Cinema Screen 3D LM76 HDTV provides a sharp picture with vivid color and virtually no motion blur.  Even though we watch HDTV regularly, we were initially taken aback by how much sharper the image was.  Additionally the frame surrounding the screen is minimal, providing an image which almost goes from edge to edge.  The narrow bezel is both visually pleasing as well as a space saver.The LG Cinema Screen 3D LM76 HDTV does an amazing job of converting 2D into 3D content.  The first time I tried this feature out, I really couldn't tell much difference and was unimpressed.  However, the factory default settings aren't set for optimal 3D viewing.  After taking time to understand the settings, any television show can be watched in convincing 3D.  Watching in 3D requires wearing the glasses and is a nice option to have, but one we rarely use as many shows don't benefit much from the added experience.As a part time gamer, the LG split screen gaming feature sounds like a great idea, but the required gaming glasses are not included.  Even though the glasses cost less than $25 for the pair, I am merely curious and have no intention of purchasing them.  I've played 3D games before and I just don't care for playing in 3D for as long as I usually play when I find the time.The LG Cinema Screen 3D LM76 HDTV allows for greater use than ever before and provides a realistic and color rich picture.  Internet based content is the future of TV entertainment, and this TV is prepared to make use of it. However there needs to be more apps to include sources like Amazon instant video.  I was surprised by how well the TV converts 2D into 3D, but see this as more of a nice to have feature than a must have.  Even with the issues I mentioned, the LG Cinema Screen 3D LM76 HDTV is an impressive TV and worth considering for purchase.PROS:Converts 2D to 3DProvides access to web and networked contentWi-Fi connectivitySleek modern appearanceCONS:Energy saving screen brightness adjustment feature is annoyingRemote is challenging to use", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "all around excellent", "Author": "robort", "ReviewID": "R10XW0OUXG3VW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did lot's of research and initially purchased a 42\" Panasonic Plasma, got it home and using the outside antenna - as I do - got a slightly fuzzy picture (previous TV was 36\" Sony/ excellent picture). I immediately packed it up and returned it to Paul's TV. They weren't thrilled about taking it back but reluctantly honored their more liberal returns policy than most other brick and mortars (like Fry's) that refuse returns for larger flat screens regardless.Subsequently I remembered seeing a noticeably great picture on a 240Hz LG - compared to the nearly identical 120Hz LG sitting next to it - in Fry's, but at the time it was about $1800 plus tax. Later Fry's advertised it for $1499 which aroused my curiosity. To my surprise I found the LG240Hz on Amazon for 33% less than Fry's (they will price match) but beyond that no tax and free shipping. I spoke with Amazon customer service regarding returns and they were far more accommodating than all others for TV's in this price range (returns conditions vary depending on price or size category so check in advance if this is an issue for you).The LG Cinema Screen 47LM7600 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240 Hz LED-LCD HDTV is a gorgeous looking set. It has a great picture with no weird lights from the edges or anything else problematic.Watching it after an hour or two our eyes were burning from the brightness. I adjusted the picture from standard to gaming and we have been extremely pleased with the picture ever since.All flat screens have speakers pointing downward or backward (these are downward). The sound is decent, but add some external speakers pointing forward (via home theater setup or whatever) and your movie experience is \"like being there.\"One other thing, I didn't initially care for newer design \"Magic\" remote that came with it. It's kinda banana shaped (but smaller) and scrolls for selections like a computer mouse. I have a couple of traditional LG remotes from my other LG TV's which function more to my preference for operating the new set.We paid slightly over a thousand. Excellent TV / excellent price.

Always thought the picture quality was a bit lacking when compared to others. So when I started looking to replace my 6 year old Samsung plasma, LG was not even on the radar. First I went after a Samsung 55\" LED which had issues that forced me to return it (and after reading about people's recent Samsung experiences, I decided to go in a different direction). As I compared prices and looked over reviews of different tv's, I came upon this 55LM7600 (price is what caught my eye initially). Because of my perception of LG, I wasn't all that excited about the prospect of getting on board with this tv but after looking over the reviews on amazon, along with some \"expert\" reviews online, I decided to give it a shot because the price was right. I have to say, I've had this tv for about 3 weeks now and I couldn't be happier with it. The picture is nice out of the box, but after some research for the right settings and some tweaks, the picture is awesome! I had the Samsung LED long enough to apply some tweaks to that picture as well and I can honestly say that this LG blows that Sammy away in both picture and sound. While you will probably want to hook up a sound bar or theatre system, the tv's speakers aren't half bad for a flat panel set, IMO. It has very good 3D picture quality and being it uses \"passive\" 3D, the glasses are much cheaper than a lot of the other 3D tv's out there. The built in wi-fi works flawlessly and there are a decent amount of apps for movies, weather, news, etc. Only negative thing I can say is that there is no amazon video app currently.

The Plex client is inbuilt in the tv unlike samsung smart tvs which you have to download the app and half of the videos will not play.

Smart tvs to figure out the differences and what to look for, stay away from, and not pay extra for.We found this one at the right price (under 900) so we ordered.  When it arrived we had it up and running in about an hour.  I had two main concerns when purchased it 1. The remote 2. The apps available.  The remote is awesome and much easier to use than others.  The apps available are exactly what's on my roku so I have disconnected it.  It in fact gives full access to Internet and your other devices on the network.The picture is great and I found a site with some recommended settings that helped quite a bit.

Great picture before I even calibrated it, sure it had a little flashlighting but so did my $5000.00 Samsung, and the flashlighting has actually decreased over time so I'm too distressed about it (unlike some people lol). The 3d on this tv is incredible my friends and myself can't get over how well it performs and the 2d to 3d is actually quite amazing as well. I have ambient lighting on behind the tv but tend to turn it off while watching 3d as I think it makes for better effects. The tv itself has more apps than I'll ever use so I'm good on that.

There will be new TVs coming out every year but I think this has all the bells and whistles required for the next few years at the least. It has WiFi, a bluetooth wand-like remote (I use the remote app on my iPhone), an amazing display, a more than sufficient number of HDMI inputs (I would totally suggest a receiver though in which case you need just one HDMI port from the TV), decent 3D capabilities (not so many great 3D discs like I mentioned).I paired my TV with a Yamaha V673 receiver and it rocks.

The black levels aren't great, but are pretty good for an LCD.  The 3D is pretty fantastic, and is some of the best I have ever seen.  When people claim they hate 3D based on the poor quality theater 3D, I show them some content on this TV and they are blown away.  I really hope they keep making content, because I see it as a huge step forward in both gaming and movie watching enjoyment.  The sound is surprisingly good for how impossibly thin the TV is.  It won't blow you away or anything, but it is the best I have heard coming from a TV like thisSo So:The remote is okay, but is a little lacking in features.  A dedicated input button would have been nice because it takes a bit to switch sources.  The apps available are passable at best.  Pretty much all the apps they offer are available and better implemented on other devices.The Bad:Speaking of apps, don't expect LG to support any of them.  The LG MediaLink app (a PLEX media server browser) was a huge selling point for me and it worked great at first, but after an update it stopped working.  I contacted LG about the issue several times and their responses are the complete opposite of helpful.  They either tell me it is something wrong with my server (it isn't, and works with 5 other devices), or tell me to reset my TV back to factory defaults.  Resetting does nothing, and there is nothing more frustrating than losing all of your saved settings and program information because of incompetent technical support.Also, the flash-lighting is pretty bad.  I know that it is an issue with this type of TV, but after a couple of iterations of this technology you would think they would have a better control of it.I would be on the fence recommending this TV, but feel for this price point it still is a good buy.

After you calibrate the settings, your picture will be perfection. The \"soap opera\" effect can be essentially eliminated, so that's not really an issue long term.Wireless networking is easy as can be. I can stream things from my computer to my tv flawlessly.LG seems to releasing firmware updates on a consistent basis, which address some of the earlier problems listed with this tv.**ConsGarbage sound, but that's to be expected with a flat television. I've found myself turning the volume up to 40-50 during some scenes, while 8-10 is suitable or the rest of the media.Dumb apps, but not too dumb. Youtube won't let you skip around the content, and sometimes crashes (which will cause you to lose your place in a movie). You cannot click on \"full screen\" if watching flash via the web browser.Will not play MKV files. This is probably my biggest issues, as a lot of content I wanted to stream is MKV. If you're computer savy, you can get these files to play, but it's not worth the time/effort to do so.**OverallThe Cons are mainly things that cause me annoyance. There is very limited light bleeding in a pitch black room, but that's to be expected. You will not find an LED edge-lit tv without SOME light bleed. Mine is almost entirely unnoticeable, and only exposed to the naked eye, if you are specifically looking for flaws.I purchased this tv refurbed from Amazon. For 900 bucks I got an amazing piece of technology, due to a \"scratch\" on the stand. I can't say I'd pay 1600+ for this television, but for the price, this is a gorgeous tv to own.

It has WIDI which is somewhat hard to find.It does a pretty good job of simulating 3D. But when playing a 3D Blu-Ray (AVATAR) the results are nothing short of spectacular. I have a 3D channel on my cable service that is mostly sports. People are walking through my living room. The loaded software is user friendly and preemptive. The upgrade software that comes automatically from the internet is sweet. An individual with practically no technical skills can get this up and running in a few minutes. The passive glasses are inexpensive and in my opinion MUCH better that the active ones. No flicker.Everybody loves 1080P. That is a given. HOWEVER when viewed in 3D, the resolution is like 5 times better. The image is so clear it is startling. I have been a Samsung fan for years. Move over Sammy, LG is in the house.

I wavered a little between the 55\" and the 47\" but I figured I'd save 600 dollars for now and go with the 47\". I love 3D movies and definitely wanted a tv that didn't use active shutter glasses. The 3D on this is amazing, but just remember to go to you settings menu and adjust it to your liking. I was little underwhelmed until I found out the 3D effect was default set to  a lower level. Before this tv  I had a VIZIO 42\" LCD, the LG LED screen is much more vibrant and a lot slimmer and there's no bulky frame around the screen which is just beautiful. Again I must remind you to go to your settings and adjust the settings to get the picture color quality that works for your room.The sound from the TV's speakers are solid. Better than most HDTV's but not anywhere near as good as a decent sound system. Which is the reason why I bought the LG sound bar with sub woofer.The 240 hz looks great and can smooth the motion in anything you put on the screen. There is and option in the settings menu to control how smooth you want the motion to be. Most people seem put off by movies they are used to seeing in only 24 frames per second running at a simulated high framerate, makes it look too much like a soap opera or natural hand held camera. I enjoy it though.The \"smart\" part of the tv also works great. I have a PS3 so I haven't used any of the apps but it was easy to set up with the wireless network. It is easy to update the firmware and it downloads it in the background. It can also stream music and videos from my PC through the TV over the Wireless setup.The only thing that may be a mark against this tv is the remote. It is quite responsive but it works like a Wii with motion controls. It's not terrible but it's not great.I have had this TV for 6 months now and have watched DVD, Bluray, 3D Bluray, Streamed content and also play a multitude of PS3 games( some in 3D).

Had it for about 6 months. It is perfect. I watch a lot of sports and action flicks. Wife watches a lot of reality shows. Kids watch a little of everything.We have it in a room that has a lot of natural light throughout the day. Picture is great in all lighting. I have not noticed any ghosting around the edges or for that matter any issues at all with the TV. 3D feature is great. Actual films recorded with 3D technology are as good as you can ask for. The 3D conversion for films recorded with non-3D technology really does add a lot of depth to the picture but not nearly to the extent of watching a program filmed in 3D.The only issue that I have had (which is minor and not really a problem) is finding a sound bar that I can fully control with the Magic remote. I started with an LG sound bar that would turn on and off automatically in conjunction with the TV but you could not control the sound. I had it connected every way possible (optical, HDMI, etc.) I returned it and got a Vizo sound bar that I love. It is connected through an HDMI cable. The volume is controlled with the magic remote after you turn it on manually each time you turn the tv on (sound bar shuts off automatically when TV is shut off).I guess I am going to have to invest in a high quality universal remote from all of the research I have done on the subject.Magic remote works great for cable box (brighthouse) and blue ray player (sony).Could not really be more happy.

I'm not exactly sure where to start and what to say, therefore, I will keep this review very brief.If what you're looking for is a great 3D TV, then this is the one for you. I can almost promise that you won't be disappointed. In fact, I can almost guarantee that you will be stunned by the breathtaking quality of this TV's 3D.The TV is thin and stylish with an appealing design. When the TV is in 2D mode, it delivers one of the highest definition pictures that's far superior to most regular HD TV's.Some reviewers mentioned something about the bleeding near the edges, but I have not experienced that, although other reviewers also suggested that the 2D to 3D conversion delivered a 3D-like experience, but I didn't notice that either, but then again, when viewing 3D movies using the glasses, the quality is simply stunning. If you're in the market for a TV, I'd suggest paying a few hundred more dollars to get this TV. I need to advise you, however, that the 3D content is still limited, in general, although I think that this will change, as more and more 3D gadgets are introduced to the market.My only disappointment with this TV is the magic remote, which, to be honest, there's nothing magic about it. I have to say that it seemed really cool in the beginning, because it delivers a different experience than any other remote you're used to (except the Wii remote), but the more I used it, the more I realized that it is very slow. It's not a deal breaker and you learn to live with it, but it also almost caused me to give this TV 4 stars instead of 5.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow great TV!", "Author": "LouA29", "ReviewID": "REDUX3TC6ULNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture is great!

The PC monitor screen controls make it easy to get screen size & position right (still using VGA input as my computer's a bit old). We've also been using the HDMI for bluray and the composite for x-box, both have been fine. To get the best pictures you do have to do use the picture wizard from the settings menu. The wizard's settings can be applied differently to each type of input, so you can choose what looks best for PC versus the others. Once you get them set you don't have to bother with them again. The remote functions like a Nintendo Wii for all advanced stuff, but it's pretty easy to use. We've only watched one 3D bluray so far. I've never seen an active 3D (with battery-powered glasses) so I can't compare this passive one to it.

Carey", "ReviewID": "R1YAB9G9XMKGAO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Over all, I like this TV. It has good black levels, rich color, better sound level than my LG 47LW5300. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because there are some \"hot spots\" on the screen. Nothing distracting, but it is there. And the motion controller is a little annoying at times. It's nice that the remote can control my cable box, but it doesn't have # buttons on the motion controller, so changing channels is a bit tedious. You can bring up an on-screen pad, but when you make a selection the on screen controller goes away. Which means each time you select the \"FAV\" button on screen, you have to start the process of bringing up the on screen controller again just to select \"FAV\" again. It would make more sense for the on screen controller to stay visible for a couple seconds in case you want to channel surf through your FAV channels.The only other quirk I have found so far is with TruMotion. Personally I prefer standard motion, so I turn TruMotion off. But for some reason, when I turn on my TV, TruMotion is turned on again. Not sure if it defaults to on when you turn the TV off.Again, overall I am happy with my purchase of the 47LM7600. Video quality is top notch in my opinion. Good, not great, Black Levels.

Couse \"darkman1969\"", "ReviewID": "R219AOML6I8O19", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yep, you read the title right.  We ditched the cable and satellite money grabbers a while back and have never looked back.  All our local channels come to us via the free over-the-air (OTA).  And I have to say, the OTA signal is fantastic and the picture quality is just as crisp as what cable was offering.  The best part is, I get to see a touchdown a solid 5 to 10 seconds well ahead of my cable user counterparts as they wait for their signal to be routed to their device.So back to the TV.  Without 3D channels why in the world would I purchase this?  Simple.  The 2D upconvert I saw at the store was awesome and watching 3D movies and as a bonus, I get everything on a 55\" LED 240hz screen that will suck you into whatever you are watching...or playing for that matter.  That's right, I also use this for my Xbox 360 and if you play Gears of War 3 in 3D...you won't ever want to go back to normal gaming.All in all, this set is a huge improvement over my 46\" LCD which was showing no signs of wear after 3 years, but to get this TV, along with a 3D blu-ray player and 12 pairs of glasses...that's right, 12 pairs of glasses for $1500 was a no brainer.  Not to mention my local big box store happened to be running a 3 year no interest financing package on anything over $999 so bingo!Now for the 2D to 3D upconvert.  Here is what I've noticed, it is not the cinematic 3D you get while watching movies or shows that were specifically shot in 3D.  What it does is have the 3D going into the TV (if that makes sense) so the depth is more inward than outward...but still crazy.  I've tried settings inside the TV (as there are many:  3D depth, 3D field) and no setting really gets the picture to jump out at you.  At the most extreme settings, the picture is a little difficult for my eyes and brain to make into one since the double image trick is so far apart.  When you watch a 3D blu-ray, the double image is just barely there to produce the 3D.  How do they do it you ask?  I think I've figured it out.  The TV upconverts every image it sees to 3D.  While in the blu-rays I've seen so far, only certain things are coded 3D for the glasses to work on.  So the TV isn't smart enough (yet) to know when you're watching football, don't code the field, lines in 3D but do code the players so that \"pop out\" effect works.The remote is nothing more than a WII remote from Nintendo for those that are looking for a comparison.  It takes a little getting used to, but once you've found the sweet spot, it's pretty basic.  I love how I can be watching TV and turn on the Xbox, then a popup comes on and says, new video source detected, would you like to switch?  Click yes, and I'm playing the Xbox.I would make this purchase again in a heartbeat.  The fact that it is a smart tv which allows me to surf the web, share music, pictures over my network is also a plus.The best part was with all of the money I've saved not paying Comcast awhile back, that savings unknowingly allowed me to purchase this TV.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply..

You have to play with picture settings quite a bit before you will get the optimum quality which suits you and your room. The glass panel is very reflective, so if you have a light source in front of TV, it will bother you a lot.Now, 3D quality: it is not impressive at all. I got Avatar Blu Ray, and I felt that 3D viewing is not up to the mark. 3D effects were not what you expect; and sometime I see bright light horizontal bar flashing across the screen. After playing with various settings, decided to switch to regular 2D. I was using LG Blu Ray which came with the TV. Olympic 3D coverage was also okay. So,i will not advise any one to buy this TV only for 3D.Sound output is not bad. Sound does feel hollow sometime, and Bass is totally missing; but the quality is sufficient for normal viewing. For movies, or music you must switch to home theater.TV looks beautiful. TV Stand is flimsy, I have doubt that it will survive for long. Eventually , I plan to mount it on wall. There are enough inputs on TV to connect all the devices you may have.Magic Motion remote will take some time getting used to , and you will like it once you get hang of it.

This is proof that LG packages this particular line of TV's well enough for shipping. I still wish that Amazon offered an option for double boxing their TV's even at an extra cost. If Amazon wants to be the leading retailer of TV's they have to overcome the lingering doubts a lot of consumers share about shipping such large, fragile and expensive items. Even if they offer hassle free returns, there is still the hassle of packaging and returning the damaged or defective item.As far as the TV is concerned, I say it is better by leaps and bounds over the Panasonics that I received and returned (TC-L47E50 and TC-L47ET5).The ET5 was so obviously damaged that I never turned on, just put back in the box. The picture is better, the sound is a lot better. The aesthetics of the TV are also totally different.I have not noticed significant flashlighting, the picture really pops at you and the 3D is good according to my family (I do not care much for it).The only area that LG is being cheap is that they skip the regular infrared remote and only ship the TV with the Wii-style RF remote that is shaped like a banana.

I replaced an older Panasonic plasma and couldn't be happier.Took me a while to get the picture tweaked right and it still probably needs a little work, but it really looks great now.  Blu-rays look stunning and games play great on both PS3 and Xbox.  Also, the TV itself is absolutely gorgeous with almost no bezel it looks really slick.My only complaint would be the built in speakers.  They just are not that great, but it's a minor complaint since I will run external speakers on it when I really want good sound.Other than that I highly recommend this TV if you are looking for a good LED with 3D.Update:  Back in I believe May, 2013 about a month before the warranty was going to be out the logic board started having issues and the TV was displaying things strangely.  Lines in the picture test or nothing at all in the test.  I contacted LG and a local repair place they contract out came and replaced it.  Wasn't the smoothest experience ever, but I can't really blame LG for the service that came.One other update is that every once in a while the TV won't seem to receive the HDMI signal from my cable box.  I will turn the TV on and it will just stay black.  I can turn the cable box on and off and still get nothing.  I have to turn the TV off completely and then turn it back on to get it to work again.  This was worse before the repair, but it still occasionally does it.I probably wouldn't buy another LG TV.  I took a shot because it was cheaper, but I think I would go back to Panasonic Plasma if given another chance.

The TV is very nice and we really like it but it does have some issues.  I would have given it 4 stars, taking only one off for the flash lighting (using CNET's settings does help mitigate the flash lighting) but there is another issue.  The strange bug is it has a hard time recognizing inputs but only in a certain situation.  I returned one TV already thinking it was defective since I didn't find many other people seeing the issue only to get a 2nd with the same problem.  I have newer, nice HDMI cables and this happens no matter which cable I use and which device I try.  The issue occurs when you turn on the TV, the input it is on does not have a signal and then you turn to a different input that does have a signal.  The input list will show that the other input is active (icon is in color) but when you switch, it will say \"no signal\".  Turning the TV off and then back on will make the TV recognize the signal.  Now if you turn on the TV and also the device the TV is currently switched to, then you can switch to any other inputs and it will immediately recognize the signal.  I think most people are not seeing this because they don't switch to a different input before turning on the one that was being used when the TV was last turned off.  Since my wife uses the PS3 to exercise, the kids use the X-box and I use SAT TV, we see it a lot since inputs are always being switched.  I contacted LG when I had the first TV and they wanted to send someone out to fix it.  Since the TV was brand new, I elected to return it to Amazon for a replacement thinking my first TV was defective.  I got the 2nd one and sure enough it has the same issue.  Part of the reason I posted a video is that I was hoping LG might see it and realize there is a real problem.  Due to the fact that turning the TV off and back on causes it to recognize the signal, I bet this could be fixed with a firmware update but first LG has to believe there is a real issue.That issue aside, the TV does have a lot of redeeming qualities.  The picture quality is very good using CNET's settings.  The viewing angle is also good for a non plasma TV.  Unlike most, I like the remote.  It is much easier to use the on screen typing menu using a motion remote than a traditional remote.  Now if I had to use the remote to control TV channels, that would not be nearly as pleasant.  The 3D really works well.  We steamed several 3D movies using VUDU and they look great.  The kids love the DUAL Play functionality.  If they would just fix the input issue I would be really happy:)", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great customer Service", "Author": "Supakit deesopha \"Tor\"", "ReviewID": "R22GBDO6MGQT7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this smart TV  unfortunately  I got the one that has the big den on the back of TV.

I still can't get over the thinness of the panel, the low power consumption and superior display. The stand is excellent too, very good for this TV (I know some others don't think so but it really is sturdy).My favorite part of this TV, other than the bright display with great contrast levels, is that fact that Wi-Fi is built in. I've enjoyed accessing YouTube and Netflix, and it's great.  Separately, I cancelled Netflix and will eventually find another content provider that can do what it did for me over the years.I've been an LG fan for a while. My blu-ray players are LG, so I'm used to the LG presentation and navigation for YouTube and apps. For the settings, if you've ever played Wii games, you know about pointing the remote and then selecting. It's extremely simple to learn.The 3D experience in my estimation beats alternatives because this type of battery-free glasses is easier on the eyes and it's as good as movie theater 3D quality.Finally, I think the value is outstanding, especially compared to where this market was at the end of last year. I can't tell the difference anyway between 120 Hz and the super-fast 240 Hz of this model, although I wear prescription glasses and others can see the qualitative difference.

I loved the panny and the 3d. I considered another panny, sony, and Samsung. After extensive research I made my decision for the Sammy 6070 as I really didn't care for the smart tv, but still wanted the 3d. And stay under $1,500. I went to the local frys to check out their stock. Unfortunately they did not have the 6070. As I walked the aisles I looked at the Sammy ES6500 thinking that would be comparable, but I couldn't stop noticing the LG right next to it. I can't say it looked better than the Sammy, but at least equal as I know the tvs on display are all set to Vivid so it's hard the judge.Went to numerous sites and the Lg xxlm7600 gets wonderful reviews. I also noted the bleeding and shadowing issues with the tv, but as you all know every device will have negative feedback and experiences. I've had the tv for about a week and all I can say is it's amazing. As for the shadowing/bleeding, besides being on the LG logo screen, doesn't affect the picture quality when watching blu-rays or general tv. I guess if I get real anal with the pq I can do the recommended calibration from the internet, but otherwise I'm not concerned. I don't mind the magic remote as I am techy, but I did program my standard cable remote with the tv and it works just fine.The 3-D is amazing. On my old GT25, the active 3d always wore out anyone watching. This LG LM7600 is passive 3d which I can now say is much more comfortable to watch.

Cho", "ReviewID": "R3NNFC79SF0A5X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After days(probably 12 hours actual) of tweaking using settings shared by others, here are the settings I settled with.  I wish this TV would give true blacks but I'd rather have bright whites and more easily seen details.  I tried CNETs settings but they seem a little to brght and washed out without details.  Keep in mind settings vary depending on environment, build, subjectivity.  The colors might not pop enough or be off slightly but I didn't want to mess with them as someone said they were close to D6500(until I changed Backlight up from 40 to 69, Color Gamut from Standard to Wide).  I compared this to an LG 47LV5500 which is similar to last years LV5600 series I believe.  Also used a 1st gen Vizio plasma, Olevia 47\" LCD and Samsung LCD all which sucked comparatively.  Compared to the LV5500, the LM6700 has a lot more details and clarity but a lot less black deepness is sacrificed.  It doesn't have enough black anyways so the increase in detail and white clarity was worth the little more black loss when increasing backlight.  Probably better colors than 5500 reading from reviews and ability to tweak more.  It also has a thing where it resets(auto turns off and on) probably every few hours or so randomly.  HINT: Anyone know why when both the LM6700 and my LG 47LV5500 are on, now my 47LV5500 turns off and resets at SAME time, it NEVER used to do that before.  Could it be remote based?  The LM6700 reboots even when the LV5500 is unplugged btw.  It also seems to be related to connected devices like apple tv via hdmi.  Maybe it is power related because the Apple TV reset too.  I was going to return this tv but for the price I paid($999 Frys leniency/deal), the 3D capability(read it's highly rated) and the settings below, I can live with the only two issues I have which are bright blacks and reset issue others also seem to have.

Easy setup but no HDMI cable included. I have did my research in advance prior receiving the TV, so I know what I am doing and what cables are missing. The quality of the TV is very good, color good and the 3D is amazing. I have no complaint about the picture and the quality except two major things worth minus one star from the review. First, the wireless internet connect is a joke. The TV cannot hook up with WEP secuity encripton. I have to change it to better security WPA or WPA2 in order for the TV to detect and connect. I have 30Mbps and putting my TV about 20 feet away from the wireless router and giving me only 1Mbps wireless speed, not even enough to watch a SD streaming video. Other wireless device in the same location showed 12Mbps signal. I finally end up using a wired ethernet cable to obtain a 17-20Mbps speed for HDX and 3D movie streaming. So don't even think about it using a wireless connection for online HDX or 3D movie streaming, it only work with wired connection. Vudu HDX steaming required 9Mbs speed. Second, the remote control also is a joke, it works like a Wii remote control but I hate the pointer so much. LG should add the pointer calibation function. Using the on screen keyboard also a big headache because of the inaccurate pointer. Third, the tech support line is always busy and require long wait. All these problems are my dislike. The picture and sound reviews are the same as other user mentioned. \"wow\" !", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "I've Had Few of The Problems Mentioned in These Reviews", "Author": "Jay Fenton", "ReviewID": "R19IVL4DLFKZVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I find some of these negative reviews mind boggling.  I have not had a problem with the so called \"flashlight effect.\" I see no ghosting in moving figures.  I found no bleeding at the edges. I also found no problem connecting to the HDMI ports.  Communications between my Oppo BDP-93 (which has 3D support), my Yamaha receiver, Sony DVD player, even my Sony VHS tape player and my Technics Cassette player hook up fine through the RCA connectors-----and those two are about a hundred years old.  There are a couple of issues that are mildly annoying. First, the manual doesn't tell you much you need to know about navigating the options on the \"Home\" screen, but that could be rectified easily by someone at LG writing a decent manual. The other thing I don't really care for is the \"Magic remote.\" It seems clumsy to work with, but as someone stated in another review, you can just use a universal remote.Another thing that's difficult to understand is why so many of the reviews proclaim that the \"Passive\" 3D System is far inferior the \"Active\" system.  You really couldn't want a sharper picture. My wife and I watched \"HUGO\" the first night we got the set and were both really impressed with the picture.  The glasses are light weight, cheap (two pair for $12) and don't have that annoying shutter.  You can even use a pair of polarized sunglasses to view the 3D.I have a theory about why some reviews are glowing and others are so downbeat.  Outside of the possibility of being  \"one of the lucky ones who got a good set,\" it may have something to do with where you bought it.  I could have had the TV six weeks sooner if I had taken a set from an outsourced electronics firm that sells through Amazon.  I waited until I saw the words \"sold by and shipped from Amazon.  After reading some of the reviews, I'm wondering if those who bought their TV \"through\" Amazon as an intermediary instead of \"From\" Amazon were the ones who had the bulk of the problems.  That may be the explanation for the variety of opinions in the reviews.  Amazon stands behind the products they sell.  Just a guess.  I'd be interested in hearing from people who bought their TVs \"Through\" Amazon rather than \"From\" Amazon.\"", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Jakester", "ReviewID": "R2XMLA3NTNIIE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A flat screen TV is a large investment so you want to make sure you get it right. I've had a large screen Pioneer plasma for the last 5 years that's still performing beautifully and works as a good benchmark for the LG. First, what's in the box.- Included in the box are 6 pairs of 3D glasses. These are fairly well made and similar to what you'd get in the theater. They worked well with the TV and were comfortable to wear for a couple hours or so. The packing of the box was excellent, very small chance of the TV getting damaged in shipment. You also get 2 cable adapters, one Composite and one Component. The adapters feature female inputs for your cables on one side and a 3.5mm male plug on the other side that connects to the TV. The remote is a motion sensor type, similar to a Nintendo WII in operation and shaped like a pistol grip. This takes a little getting used to but works fine. The TV itself comes in 3 parts, the base, the base connector, and the screen. You assemble the base to the base connector and then the entire stand to the TV. 8 phillips screws. Takes about 10 minutes and the hole alignments and threading fit are perfect. The base can swivel about 10 degrees in either direction. The screen comes with soft rubber caps that fit on either side of the screen so you can carry the TV without getting smudges on the screen. I recommend using two people although it's light enough to be lifted by one person, albeit unwieldy.- Connections abound. On the back of the TV, facing to the side are 3 USB and 4 HDMI ports. This makes the hookup easier to manage if you're in a tight space. The remaining connections face down and consist of 1 coax In, 1 Component In (3.5mm), 1 Composite In (3.5mm), 1 VGA in, and 1 LAN in if you have a hard network connection. The TV also accepts wireless LAN connection.- Performance. Superb but, for me, not perfect. The high def picture is extremely sharp on HD channels and very good at regular channels as well. The 3D can be turned on or off via the remote and it also works very well. You can actually watch a regular channel as 3D if you want and it's ok but not nearly as good as something that's meant to be watched in 3D. 3D isn't a must have for me but it is kind of neat when it's available. The sound of the TV is fine and on par with other TVs of this size. I had it hooked into a surround system as I watch TV mostly for movies. Here's where the \"not perfect\" part comes in. When using this TV for movies the picture was actually TOO sharp. What I mean by that is movies, whether broadcast, streamed, DVD, or BluRay, looked more like live TV than like movies. It's hard to describe without seeing it but it's like the difference between video and film. I assumed it was a setting so tried every variation of picture settings I could fine. There are several presets with the TV like Cinema but these didn't help. I tried every combination of sharpness, contrast, color saturation, etc. that the TV had to offer but I couldn't get around it. I had other people look at it to ensure it wasn't just me. I did not preset their expectations, just had them watch for a while and then switched over to a movie. They all had the same reaction of \"is that a movie, it doesn't look right\". As movie watching is such a large part of my TV viewing and, I assume, most other people, I had to take a star off the score. I certainly admit that this may just be a personal preference but if you're looking at this TV I urge you to try before you buy when it comes to movies.Other than the movie display item, this is a superb TV. There are a number of internet sights pre installed (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) and these worked great. I used a wireless home LAN and the TV found and connected in seconds. Overall it's a good TV and if the movies had been good for me I would have replaced he Pioneer. I stress that this could be personal preference on my end so you should check it out yourself to see if this is an issue with you. If it's not, it's a great TV.**Update** I bumped this rating up to 5 stars. The problem with the movie picture is called the Soap Opera effect and is easily corrected by changing a setting on the TV.

The ease of settup was nice and smooth, the stand was pretty easy putting together,and the PQ was very good out of the box with only minor tweaking. Perfectionists who love tweaking picture settings will love this tv! The number of picture settings can be overwelming at first but after awhile it's not so bad once you figure out how each setting works.As for the tv itself, my particular tv has very minimal flashlighting to where it's nearly non existant upon watching normal viewing material. I've heard other people had much worse screens so i guess i'm pretty lucky.Trumotion is adjustable, i've played with it and it has a user mode if you want to adjust dejuder and de-blur seperately.Sound quality is good, like others have mentioned it's got plenty of volume, to the point where you don't have to turn it up too loud to hear it, also Clear Voice 2 may come in handy for late night viewing so you won't have to turn the volume up too much at night.For most people setting up their picture settings i recommend standard or one of the expert modes for now. The Picture Wizard 2 was ok, but i find it better to adjust the settings on my own to see what does what.Overall for the tv's of 2012, this LG Cinema Screen series should rank up there very high, because theres so much value with this tv, it's unbelievable, from the 6 pairs of 3D glasses included, excellent 3D, and PQ is outstounding.I highly recommend this tv to anyone comparing tv's looking to get a new 2012 model.

TONS of settings to get your pic just right & easy to do with many many options to tweak your pic perfectly for each type stuff you watch.Super thin bezel makes this look AWESOME even when off & when on, it literally looks like a stunning picture just floating in the air...the super thin bezel makes it appear as if there is no tv...just a stunning pic floating in your room.Standard def programming looks great, HD programming looks great.Personally, I think the sound is great.

These people claiming otherwise are flat out wrong by claiming LG is ripping off the consumer...The 60Hz you see is from your SOURCE, but this LM7600 IS 240! Period! Go to AVS where the experts are & they will confirm this or better yet, LG's own website lists BOTH the RR & PANEL SPECIFICATIONS. I also spoke to a level3 engineer at lg who also confirmed THIS IS TRUE & I even pointed to the reviews & comments from the 'dynamic duo' claiming LG is lying to everybody & the guy just laughed & said \"they have no idea what they are talking about & need to comprehend the technology which they obviously dont\" & he assured me most everybody else was correct & these 2 were just wrong & they even went on to say 'We could never lie or claim the TV is not what we say....The AG would shut us down, but it is more common then you think as we get alot of calls asking why its only 60Hz & the bottom line is even many of our own reps are not aware of how to explain this to the consumer so even our own reps get it wrong which only misleads the consumer even more, but rest assured if the specs say 120, your getting 120, if it says 240 your getting 240....we would be shut down if we advertised it as 120, 240 or etc, but in reality it was only 60Hz.....not only would we be shut down but the lawsuits would be flying....people just dont understand the technology and again, even our own reps get it wrong many times'.....Anyway, GREAT TV.

THRILLED WITH MY LG LM 7600. As are most judging by the overwhelming positive reviews here & on other forums.Oh & when I swapped out the sammy for the LG at my local retailer they said although they LOVE SAMSUNG, they too think Samsung 'took a step backwards' on the 2012 models & they are getting alot coming back for exchange....& 95% are exchanging for an LG with most saying they were glad they switched to the lg.But with so much misinformation, I rec ignoring reviews & go in person & test the TV's out. Another reviewer had the same Samsung Model as me. & he liked the pic quality but also felt the sammy was severely lacking in all other areas. I told him the same..IGNORE all these reviews & go in person & make your own decision as to which is better. Needless to say he kept the sammy to put in the bedroom & got the lm7600 after seeing it in person & he agreed....Better pic qualty then the samsung & better everything else then the sammy & he is thrilled with his lm 7600 as are most, & its in his main room & his #1 go to tv....Folks, if the price is right, BUY THIS TV. 95% will be THRILLED with it. & if your not, swap it out for something different, but the overwhelming majority LOVE the LG LM series!BTW, I fully expect 2 or 3 reviewers that are simply wrong to downvote my review & post absurd comments about the 60hz thing. Folks, IGNORE THESE CLOWNS..HECK, ignore THIS REVIEW & GO TO A RETAILER AND MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION but do not listen to the 'dynamic duo' as I call them as they will only mislead you in to passing on a GREAT tv & you'll end up with a lesser quality one if 'you follow their lead'.<<From LG Whose legal team is now on top ensuring those posting false information or claims that 'LG IS SCAMMING PEOPLE' or other harsh accusations, will be held accountable :From LG :Consumer Question :Why does our tv only have 60hz when it is supposed to be 120hz?We purchased the LG and it is supposed to be 120hz tru motion but it is only showing at 60hzLG EXPERT ANSWER :StaffExpertAnswer:The 120Hz setting is designed into the LCD panel of this television. All broadcasts, regardless of the notation on the screen, will automatically be processed to fit the 120Hz refresh rate of the screen. The 60Hz designation simply refers to the signal frequency as it is received. If it appears on the TV screen, it is showing as 120Hz.This will work the same on all LG model Tv's & all Tv's in general. If you have a 240 or higher, it too will show the 60Hz from your source/signal, although you do have 240.You can also review this information under \"Refresh Rate\" & \"Panel Specifications\", which both show the 120 (or 240 & higher) TM & the 120 (240 or higher) PANEL SPECIFICATIONS.(I Capitalized the PANEL SPECS!)>>", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible flashlighting and many other issues", "Author": "Lord Galderon", "ReviewID": "R3F2DB77243JAC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After going from a very old and very poor quality 720p Plasma TV, I was excited to finally have a 1080p TV with superb picture quality. In addition, my parents have a 2 year old Sharp Aquos LCD that is stunning, and from the reviews and technology this TV has, I expected the LG to be outstanding and to surpass the older Sharp, and definitely surpass my old Plasma.The LG 55LM7600 is far from outstanding, and is in fact, atrocious in its picture quality. There are a lot of superficial things to love about this TV (great looking exterior, awesome passive 3D, decent set of apps, good price), but a bad picture quality defeats the entire purpose of having an HD TV. Picture quality is the core of an set. I won't sacrifice picture quality for a thinner unit, no bezel, 3D, or any \"smart\" features.First the main issue: This TV suffers from SEVERE edge bleeding/flashlighting, clouding, DSE (dirty screen effect) and a few other issues. Basically every negative aspect of LED tech you read about in reviews is very apparent in this TV. I figured over 100+ 5 star reviews couldn't be wrong, and it could be that I got a bad unit.. but others have similar complaints, and it could be that the 5 star users aren't watching letterbox or darker lit films.I'll tell you that I can't comfortably watch a letterbox or \"dark\" movie on this Tv because the flashlighting is so bad in the upper and lower right corners. It's extremely distracting and ruins the immersive experience of watching a movie. It's exactly how people describe it: like someone is holding a flashlight in the corners of the TV. It's always in my peripheral vision and is a total deal breaker for this TV. I WAS able to tone it down a little bit by turning the contrast all the way up to 100, lowering backlight to 55, and turning Local dimming on High. But it was still there, and these settings ended up causing other issues which I'll explain in a bit. I will give this TV credit and say that on certain movies such as Toy Story 3 (bluray) this TV looked phenomenal. Toy Story 3 is a brighter movie than say, The Matrix, and I didn't notice flashlighting during this film. It was also a full screen movie, so I didn't have letterbox where I can clearly see the flash lighting. The Matrix was unwatchable because it's a darker movie and is in lettebrox. Also wanted to note that the up scaling on the LG bluray player I used was absolutely atrocious and made DVDs look like VCR movies. But that has no real impact on this review because it's a separate device. I'm strictly reviewing the 55LM7600 here.Aside from the flashlighting which in itself kills the enjoyment of this TV, this unit has really bad \"dirty screen effect\" (DSE) which is a term I learned after googling  and trying to figure out what the \"banded lines\" were that are appearing on this TV. Basically, when the camera pans across a shot, you see these dirty looking bands on the TV. It's really bad in this particular TV and it's the first time I've really noticed it while watching an HD television. I watched the first 15 minutes of The Descendants and I couldn't get through it because the DSE was so bad. I hear it's common in TVs but personally I haven't been able to notice it this bad on the Sharp or any of my friend's Samsung models.Another issue I'm having with this TV are the pixels themselves. There is a clump of about 8-9 dead pixels in the very top of the TV near the bezel. This is something that I understand is common in most electronic devices, and honestly I can barely see it from where I'm sitting (about 7 feet away.) However, there is something going in this TV where I'm getting tiny bursts of light sporadically in a few pixels. While watching Terminator 2 on Blu Ray I first noticed it, and it's in every blue ray movie and anything I watch on Verizon Fios. There are tiny white flare ups that come and go across the screen every minute or so. It's yet another distraction and indicator of poor quality. I ahven't been able to find any mention of this online, but it's definitely an issue in this unit.Basically, I REALLY wanted to love this TV. This was a big purchase for me and I spent a lot of time researching TVs and this had everything I wanted. Mostly I read complaints about the remote, which actually is kind of a pain to use, but I mostly use my Verizon remote anyway, so no big deal. The biggest thing though, is that this Tv has a flat out terrible picture quality in most viewing conditions. It would be great if all I wanted to do was watch Pixar movies, but anything dark or letterbox is an absolute no go. I'm aware that edge lit LEDs have some light bleed/flashlighting issues, but man, this is just beyond unacceptable. I'm really not picky either. Like I said, my old TV was old and I was used to a bad picture. This picture is certainly better than that TV overall, but has more distractions and quirks that make it unacceptable.I'm not sure what TV to get after this. I was going to exchange it for a new one, because this unit might be defective, but from what I'm reading, I don't want to chance it and get another one with the same issues. This unit was manufactured in NOV 2012 in Mexico, and from what I read most defective units are from India, so I'm just assuming that all of these LGs are subject to problems. Also wanted to note that this is not a verified amazon purchase because it wasn't available to even buy on amazon, which I'm reading is due to the fact that item has been suspended for purchase for too many returns. I (reluctantly) bought the TV from Best Buy, and was even more excited about the TV because they price matched a site online and I saved close to $300 off of the retail price. Unfortunately, it's still not worth it. I will be returning this TV today.*Also wanted to note that I called LG to explain the issue. The agent was aware of flash lighting in these Tvs but she said she only personally gets about 2 calls per quarter about this issue. She was very nice and told me that there is no reason I should have this problem and that my hard earned money should go towards a quality product. She said I should return the TV immediately for an exchange or refund. So hey, no hard feelings towards LG, but I think this series and this technology just isn't for me. I'll include pictures of the terrible flashlighting so you can see what I'm dealing with. I'm writing this review so that people gain some insight into possible problems found in this series of LG Tvs. If I left anything else out or if you have any questions, please let me know.******UPDATE 12/19/2012*********I receieved a replacement for my \"defective\" LG  55\" LM7600 from Best Buy. I had to pack the Tv up myself, and go to the store and get a new one. This was very time consuming and a huge hassel. This TV has no dead pixels, but I regret to inform you all that the flashlighting issue is still terrible, and the clouding on this TV is worse than the previous one I had. On the bright side, the dirty screen effect seems to be less prevalent. I was able to adjust the settings to reduce some of the flashlighting on the TV, but the upper left corner gets no relief and is basically unfixable. On a letterbox movie or black screen before a movie starts, the flashlighting and clouding is a complete joke. I'm embarassed for LG for putting out a product with such inherent manufacturing flaws. In additon to these persistent problems inherent in this model, the \"smart\" features are atrocious. I have a 15-20mbps high speed FIOS wireless connection, and this TV can barely play anything from Netflix and the TV often fails to load a Hulu movie. The first 30 seconds to a minute of any Netflix movie will remain grainy and pixelated until it loads fully. Momentarily the movie will stop and have to rebuffer or go through those grainy pixelated streaks. This is unacceptable. I have a Roku box that I was hoping I didn't have to use because I wanted everything all in one. It's a good thing I have it because it works flawlessly. Loads Netflix in about 5-10 seconds and is crystal clear. If you plan on watching Netflix streaming, get a roku box or an apple TV, as this \"smart\" TV can't handle the very simple task that 99% of new devices easily deliver.I have until Jan 24 to return this TV, and I will most likely return it. I will keep the 1 star rating. Two or more defective TVs in a row is unacceptable, and I won't waste my time packing and unboxing another LG only to have the same issues. And btw, this TV was from a different manufacturing batch as my last one. It was manufactured 3 months earlier than the one it is replacing. I don't care how many 5 star amazon reviews this TV has, the masses aren't always right, and I won't waste my time with LG again.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good but could be better or cheaper", "Author": "Igor V. Zavoychinskiy", "ReviewID": "R1NHM4XD853D1F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In general TV is good but it could be either better or cheaper.Pros:- Slim. If you plan to hang it on the wall it would look just perfect.- Screen is low glare. It's worse than screens with anti-glare covering but still much better than regular.- High brightness and contrast. Brightness is especially important when you use 3D glasses.- \"True motion\" feature is awesome. At the beginning it may be a bit uncomfortable but once you get used to it you'll never turn it off.- 3D is very good. Avatar 3D was perfect on the TV.- TV understands HD containers like MKV so, you can upload your move on flash disk and attach it to TV.Cons:- Screen matrix is of low quality. Take a look at customers added pictures to see \"flashlight and clouds\". On a dark screen you never miss these issues. Fortunately, it's very unusual to have a totally blank screen in a real movie and if you have at least couple of moving images you won't notice matrix artifacts. Initially I was going to return TV back to Amazon but eventually decided to give it a chance. After 3 weeks of usage I cannot say I have much troubles because of these issues but manufacturer should have to do something, like lowering price or warning people.- Magic remote is boring. At the beginning you'll be excited with the feature of using mouse pointer on the screen: it's really handy when you need to select an app in the menu. Though, when you only need to adjust sound volume or change the channel you hardly need arrow pointer on the screen. In the middle of movie action you may decide to make a volume a bit lower but instead you get a player frame popped up and pointer cursor right atop of Optimus Prime's face. This feature should be more smart or at least adjustable.- Network movie sharing is not that great. In reference I read that TV supports Windows 7 Media Player sharing but after 4 hours of trying I gave up: my TV just don't see my laptops, PCs or network drive. Eventually, I had to install on my home's server their suggested application - Plex Media Server. I pointed server to a network drive and this did the trick - TV was able to play the movies. Though, TV's Plex Media player has issues: controls are not very convenient, sometimes it become very slowly and on some movies it just don't see soundtracks except the first one. Not a player of my dream. Though, this can be fixed in future firmware updates and I really hope they will do it soon.- 3D technology. In this TV frame separation is implemented via lines interlacing. In other words, when you wear 3D glasses your right eye see every odd line on the screen and the left eye sees every even line. This is implemented via different polarization of lines on the matrix and this is why you may use cheap passive glasses. Why is it \"a con\"? Because of by using this technique you get twice less resolution of any 3D movie you watch. Let's say you bought \"Avatar 3D\" on Blue-ray, its format is Full HD (1080 pixels height) but in fact you see a \"half Full HD\": vertical resolution for each eye will be 540 pixels instead of 1080. Personally, I wouldn't say this is a big deal since in an action movie your mind just cannot catch the difference between 1080 and 540 lines but... technically quality gets lower.- YouTube player is awful. It's slow, buggy and sometimes just becomes unresponsive. Plus, searching on YouTube doesn't support non-latin alphabets.- TV doesn't have analogue sound outputs. If you have old system you'll be unable to connect it. The only output available is a digital one. If you're going to connect TV to your modern home theater it's good but if you only wish to connect a sub-woofer you'll have to buy a converter and get into troubles with separate volume adjusting.- TV doesn't allow fine tuning of 3D mode support. I connected a PC via HDMI but then failed to make TV correctly recognizing frames on the screen: there were always some artifacts due to not precise splitting. So, if you're going to watch 3D movies from a PC storage you'll have to use either a flash drive or a network solution.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV!!!", "Author": "JayBob", "ReviewID": "R1A6PNDZFKZ07G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OMG!!!

Douglas", "ReviewID": "R18HAPJSYCCG5Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Had been nagging the wife for a long while about how we needed to upgrade our living room TV of about 5 years.  She felt that since it still worked, it was fine and we didn't need a new one.  However she simply could overlook things like the pixelization and horrible black levels.  I could not.She finally gave in and told me that I could get a new TV.  Knowing that whatever I got, I would be stuck with for another 5 years, I wanted to make it count.  I also knew that if I tried to break the bank, it'd be even longer before I could get any more toys, so I started looking into a good mid-range set.  After reading about the LG 55LM7600 55\" I thought I found the perfect TV.RIght out of the box, the picture looked pretty damn good.  I'd even go so far as to say that it looked better than I expected.  I hooked up all my accessories to try them all out and everything was coming together well when I decided to throw in a Blu Ray on my PS3 and see how that looked.  Ceremoniously, I picked \"The Empire Strikes Back\".  Things were looking good and I dialed in the settings suggested online.  The one thing that still looked like crap was any quick motion.  I expected much better with the 240Hz refresh rate.  I'm not talking simple blur; it was horrible looking the way the image fell apart and looked like a YouTube video playing over dial-up.  I kept tinkering with the settings and nothing looked right.  About this time in the movie, the lightsaber scenes came up and even with them not moving, the image of the glowing laser swords were all broken up and just unwatchable.About this time, I noticed in the upper right hand corner of the screen (visible when you wave the remote control wand around) that the picture was only playing at 60Hz.  I suspected something was wrong and contacted LG.  They said that the settings on the PS3 were wrong and to fix those and everything would be fine.  I searched about online and found how to set the settings and found that I had the correct (suggested) settings.  Frustrated, I tried watching some of the HD channels on my DirecTV.  Again, the refresh rate was bad.  I called into DirecTV and they verified that I was setup correctly and should be getting 1080p at at least 120Hz.  They set me up with an appointment at a later date to look at it (will get back to that later).I continued trying all my other peripherals.  My Sony Blu Ray player.  Same results.  My Toshiba DVD player.  Still the same.  Apple TV.  Again.  HD videos downloaded from iTunes to my computer and connected directly to the TV.  Still bad.  I even bought some HD videos directly from within the LG app.  Still crap.Thinking it might be junk HDMI cables, I rushed out to the nearest Best Buy and paid way too much for the best cables they had, figuring that if that fixed it I would be okay with the price and the fact that I had given Best Buy more of my money.I get home, swap out HDMI cables and run through each device again, getting all the same results.The next day, the DirecTV guy comes out to check things out.  It was a brand new installation so they wanted to make sure that I was happy with everything.  The tech spends about 30 minutes playing with the settings and can't get anything better than 60Hz.  Finally, he thinks to go check my old No Name Brand flat panel that I had moved up to the bedroom.  He goes through the menu and sees that it is running the signal at 120Hz.  As best as he could tell, he felt that maybe I got the wrong TV in the box.  He even goes so far as to calibrate the old TV and manages to get a better picture (refresh-wise) than the new LG.Frustrated, I have attempted to communicate with LG via their forums and by phone and consistently get the brush off with them blaming everything else other than their set.  Needless to say, I am very disenchanted by their customer support.So now I will have to deal with this for the next five years and be reminded of it whenever I watch anything that isn't standing perfectly still.

At first it started to be a minor annoyance but as time passed, the edge bleeding started to effect the quality of the picture around upper and lower right edges so much that it would light up dark scenes on those edges.

Ours displays very, very little of that defect. This TV sounds quite good considering the fact that it has a very thin the display panel.  We anticipate connecting it to an A/V receiver just purchased for that funcion.We are receiving TV via over the air broadcasts, finding that the remote is somewhat unhandy since one must scroll channel-to-channel to pick a desired broadcast as there is no number pad on the Magic Motion remote.  Sometimes unexpected settings would occur if remote was jostled by a bump or drop.  That remote is shaped so that it rocks and rolls when placed on a table, sometimes falling to the floor in the process.  The Magic Motion remote is also not backlit, making it hard to find the control buttons in a poorly lit room.  I rectified these issues by purchaing a pre-programmed Universal Remote Control-WR7 that we usually use now in lieu of the Magic Motion remote.We received the product within five days of ordering, the White Glove delivery service included better than I expected.

This is fairly objective.  I liked it at first, its kinda novel and works reasonable well.  However, it takes a lot more time to click through a menu to accomplish a task rather than just pressing a button on a remote.  The really unforgiveable aspect of the remote is that if it gets bumped, moved, or touched while the tv is on (which it inevitably will), a pink cursor pops up on the screen distracting you from what you are watching.  This is not a reason to to avoid this TV though.  Simply purchase the standard remote that is designed for this TV (universal remotes are universally crappy because they arent designed for the TVs specific functions) LG OEM REMOTE PART NUMBER: AKB73615313Just google this part number, buy the remote for about 20$ and you'll never use the magic wand remote again.  Problem solved.As for my take on the TV, I love it.  No noticeable backlight non-uniformity issues. Picture quality is all around stellar.  I advise turning off or at least down the de-judder and de-blur.  Dont get me wrong, it works great, but I personally find the ultra smooth motion it creates to look unnatural and kind of nauseating.  I find dejudder 2/10 and de blur 2/10 to work well for my eyes.For all you nutty videophiles the video setting are EXTREMELY customizable.  the dejudder and de blur has 10 levels, you can change settings on, or just turn off all the post processing techniques that the TV does.  And it will save your custom modes under any of 7 presets (intelligent sensor, vivid, standard, cinema, game, isf expert 1, isf expert 2)  The standard setting looks good, if you want accurate color reproduction rather than overblown super saturated colors then the isf modes are the way to go (isf presets are imaging science foundation calibrations).

The white line is actually a brightened picture. Is this a new form of edge bleeding?The remote control is not working properly.

I've set it low, high, medium, no settings produce any results that don't break the picture. Prior to buying a new TV I researched smoothing technologies online and didn't expect perfection but this is just unwatchable. This must be an issue on LG's part too because my parents' Visio has smoothing set to medium and I've noticed no such issues.Glare: It doesn't bother me too much but I have noticed significant reflective glare compared to my old Samsung TV. It also picks up the red and green colors (light spectrum) from the light behind my sofa in the reflection.Remote: I have no problems with it being a wand but i don't think that necessarily means it should also lack many of the physical buttons we are accustomed to on a regular TV remote.

I don't see what's wrong with just pushing one button on the remote to do this task.Overall, when I turn trumotion off and tweak the picture settings the TV still looks very good. I haven't noticed any of the flash-lighting issues other people have mentioned either.However, the picture just isn't as smooth as i expected it to be for a 240hz TV. For $999 though i'm not too unhappy and considering my previous Samsung kept struggling to turn on due to the their cheap usage of capacitors i'm happy to try a new brand. So far so good - I'll be sure to update this review if i uncover anything that gets better or worse or if anyone has any pointers for me.I'd be happy to recommend this TV for any casual user. I'd like to know if anyone else notices the trumotion issues i mentioned above. I've seen smoothing technology before and it's not as bad as i've seen here.----------- UPDATE ------------Noticed that the trumotion only seems to be an issue with SD cable channels/sources. All HD channels and bluray's that i used allowed trumotion work flawlessly. For this i changed my 4-star to a 5-star. I guess it should just be noted that trumotion should not be used for standard definition with this TV. Just a slight inconvenience when switching channels.----- UPDATE (07/25/2012) -----The trumotion is beginning to be more of a pain now. As noted above, the trumotion seems to only be juddery and jumpy on specific TV channels. It's really quite irritating having to constantly turn the feature on and off when changing channels - It is also really bad when streaming from netflix or amazon prime via my PS3. I don't understand why the feature doesn't just work correctly no matter what the source as other TV's I have seen do not have this issue. Back to a 4-star for me. The feature really only works for DVD's and Blu-rays for what i can tell and then a select few TV channels that broadcast HD shows. Though this can also not be true because some providers broadcast SD through their HD channels.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Looking Good", "Author": "Kevin James \"KJ\"", "ReviewID": "R3MH6KKEGQW2ZS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV.

The digital 3D is not really good but wasn't expecting much there on the other hand the Blu-ray 3d is out of this world and the theater glasses are light weight making them the perfect fit for this tv. The non-shutter style 3D makes for a great option if your looking to view the 3D at different viewing areas rather than straight forward as most or all shutter glasses do.

It was really thin, although I don't think it really matters as they are all about maximum 3-4\" thick anyway. The picture quality was decent, the first passive 3D technology was definitely a plus as it meant very light 3D glasses. Our overall experience was nice while the TV worked. I thought the interface for the internet connectivity was OK, it offered a variety of physical connections and picture options too. The light 3d glasses made the experience really enjoyable for the little kids.However, no matter how much I tried to adjust the picture options, I was not able to get rid of the vertical banding in the picture where the contrast changes from the dark colors to light colors. This is not occurring at the physical edges of the TV, but perhaps due to some digital filter to enhance the contrast in the picture that I could not manage to turn off. It seems to be happening much worse with the lower resolution videos, and less noticeable with the HD videos from an HD video player. When I also turned down the contrast, it was less noticeable, so I left it that way. Perhaps my unit was just defective, but I have seen a couple other people mentioning about this problem on the internet.Our TV sat on a pretty nice and stable TV stand, free and clear of any vibration. Unfortunately, the whole excitement abruptly ended by the death of the TV panel about 16 months after the purchase, it is as good as a brick now. The technician replaced the main board and power supply, and concluded that the connections of panel could be defective (soldered pins into the LED, impossible to replace) as the back light appeared to be still functioning. So, the TV could not get the video signals from its main board to its pixels anymore.I will probably sell the power supply and main board on internet and recycle the rest, these two parts seem to be on high demand! I didn't like the picture quality as much as even my 5 year old (Sony XBR5) LCD TV due to the edge bleeding at the physical edges of the TV and banding issues within the actual picture.

I called LG for service and first was asked to perform a number of diagnostic steps (LG was assuming the problem was some type of cable interference, wireless interference, poor installation, etc.  The only thing that convinced them was when I told them the problem appeared from multiple input sources (i.e. cable box and Blu-ray player (fortunately a Sony!)). Once they admitted it was time to dispatch service, I learned that my service area (Southeastern NC) does not have a service center and that it would take from 3 to 5 business days to call me back with a plan.  This is a TV that I spent close to $2000 on and part of a $10 thousand investment I made in 3 brand new LG LED TVs.I must admit, I also recently purchased two Vizio TVs on Amazon.

With the 55 inch set, I've plugged in my 16 gig flash drive that stored two 7 gig HD movies (Oz, the Great and Powerful & Life of Pi), and the LG played them flawlessly in 3D. I've also done the same with my external hard drive as well. I just plug it into the electrical wall outlet, and plug in the USB cable and it identifies the drive in seconds. From there, it'll give you a file folder window where you can choose the compatible files you wish to open. Typically, my movie files have been MKV's or MP4's.

I wanted a passive 3-D LED tv with outstanding picture quality.  This is the only LG product in my house...everything else including an older plasma tv is Samsung, so it took some a decent amount of research and convincing for me to submit to buying an LG.  Price was a lower priority but it did help.Adorama and Amazon's communication were outstanding as usual.  I will continue to buy from Amazon and Adorama anytime.However, the local delivery of the tv (given that it's a large product), I guess, gets outsourced through a company called Manna Distribution Services whose customer service turned out to be horrid.  I got a very rude interaction from them when trying to get a more precise delivery time window on the day of delivery.  They gave me the wrong delivery time while the driver was literally at my doorstep.  This was bad enough for me that it will affect any future buying decision 100% if the seller chooses Manna.As far as technical details, it took quite a while and web research to get the picture settings just right to get rid of the \"soap opera effect\".  Basically, you have to turn off the frame-to-frame interpolation commonly used in LED TVs.  On this LG, the feature is called LG TruMotion.  Next I had to adjust sharpness, contrast, brightness and many other settings to make up for having turned off the interpolation.  So, just be sure to look this phenomenon up on the web.The Wii-like remote is neat and works relatively well for navigating through the homescreen menus (e.g., scrolling through the Netflix movie thumbnails by swiping left or right).  There is a delay in the remote becoming activated by displaying its crosshairs on the tv's screen.  This is a bit annoying, so I do find that I use the cable box remote more often, e.g., for punching in actual channel numbers, muting the tv, or adjusting volume.The browser is horribly slow.  I can't really see its use when one can use the laptop connected with HDMI to the tv, or via DLNA, a lot more productive.On a purely personal note, not having an audio-out jack, makes the every night task of using wireless headphones quite a multi-step chore.  I know this sounds like a peeve, but I use the wireless headphones every night since our young kids are asleep.  Here are the tv steps:  activate settings via the tv's remote, goto sound settings, turn off the tv's speakers, then dismiss 3 on-screen dialogs.  Too many steps for me.Nevertheless, the picture quality and passive 3-D feature still outweigh the cons for me.

Comes with 6 pairs of glasses, and to buy extra's are cheap, you can usually find them for around 10$.  It absolutely one of the best pictures, period.  This model has plenty of features. I love the wand remote, and the fact that it is programmable. The Wireless is excellent boot times of the apps is pretty decent, I know there are faster T.V.'s out there, but it beats other devices, such as neo tv, apple tv, and roku, it is just simply faster.  I also like the fact that you can see the program playing while going to the home screen to adjust the settings.  This is Key, since this is a TruMotion T.V. you are going to have that documentary feel to it.  So there is Two \"Expert Mode,\" option. these are the macro I use one for 3D and the other for TV.  I was able to fix the documentary looking feel to it, by turning Off TruMotion (some may just adjust down, this is just my preference), and the TV itself didn't lose any Value, in picture, clarity, or color, it just rids of that awkwardness.  For sports you might want to choose the preprogrammed \"sports\" option available to you, so that the motion is more clear when watching football.  I adjusted my settings when I was watching regular HDTV< and I also adjusted for 3D TV.  These variables are going to be slightly different for everyone, pending, distance, angle, height. I have not tinkered around with the voice activation, on the TV, but the remote itself feels weird at first, but it is pretty easy to get used to.  I highly recommend getting this TV, the newer model of this, isn't going to be much different, the hardware will be the same for most part, they might had a couple of more cores, as I did see a quad core (this may be pretty useless for a smart TV, since the software doesn't take a lot of power to run.  It is a Linux based software.  Also I bought a 3D Blu Ray player to match the TV, it doesn't really make a difference which Blu Ray player you buy, but for higher end TV, it doesn't hurt to get matching accessories.  All movies, and HD are Fantastic looking.  The 3D exceeded my expectations.  As always there needs to be one complaint, sound, as advanced as Technology is, this once upon a Time 3K TV, still doesn't live up to the quality of the picture, it really could be a lot better.  The sound isn't bad and there are many adjustments, but never-the-less.  I have mine hooked up to a 7.2 surround Sound system, Onkyo, Yamaha blend and I  use the fiber optic out put from the TV and into the amp, and that sounds great.

The signal is so clear and we get 38 channels (for free - DC area).  We also connected it with our home's wi-fi network.  That's pretty cool.  What was really unexpected and so cool is that I can control it with my nook tablet (which has the Android OS on an SD card) using the LG android app from the Google app store.  That's so cool.  The remote is both nice and a slight nuisance.  It's very easy to use as long as you don't want to punch in channel.  That requires a couple extra steps because the remote only has a few buttons.  Once you get used to the remote, though, it's pretty darn nice.  Another thing that is better than we expected is the 2D-to-3D conversion.

The outcome from the development team rep, which was news to everyone else from LG, is that there are no plans to update the \"in-build\" version of Adobe Flash Player for the 2012 SMART TV platform.  Only the Google TV, model G2, will get some sort of optimization patch because the G2 operates on the Google platform.  So, Google will provide a patch of sorts.So, no ESPN3, ESPN Live, Yahoo! Finance videos, or most any video content that requires Flash.How many SMART TV's do you think LG would have sold if their marketing was accurate to reflect that the 2012 SMART TV's from LG with their built-in WiFi and full web browser can't play any video content through that browser because the TV was built with an old Flash player version that can't be updated?Flash Player 10.1 is what is on my TV.  While my set was built in July 2012, Flash player 10.1 was released in early 2010.  Most web content requires flash player 11.x.  It is interesting to note that while Adobe released Flash Player 11 in Oct 2011, LG choose to use and continues to use the outdated version 10.x in it's 2012 models.I thought that an equivalent Samsung model like the ES7100 series would be an alternative.  Nope, Samsung built their 2012 SMART TV's with an in-build of Flash player 10.1 as well!The LG developer noted that there are expected hardware and software changes for the 2013 SMART TV products.  I doubt that will help any of us who have 2011 or 2012 products.I could not believe my ears when the LG developer suggested the work around solution to this Flash Player issue was to connect a notebook computer or netbook via a HDMI input!  Great support from LG - not!It is also interesting to note that I tried to post this same information on the LG website in the Q & A section for the 47LM7600 to answer a question posted by DavidX asking when will the flash player be updated to version 11?  While I created and account at LG.com, LG did not post my answer.  I guess they will not permit any negative comments about their products.  It is even crazier that the LG web support tech NeilE tries to shift the blame to Adobe for not updating their product when it's LG's design flaw to in-build the Adobe software so that it cannot update.***ORIGINAL REVIEW 10 July 2012***I was not originally considering a 3D TV or a SMART TV.  But last month, the price difference between the LG LS5700, LM6200, LM6700 and the LM7600 was about $100.  I had also looked at similar models from Samsung and Panasonic.  After completing the \"look, touch and feel\" comparisons of these models with the other manufacturers in the retail stores and reading on-line professional and consumer reviews, I decided that LG would be the one for me.I selected the LM7600 model because I wanted a black frame when viewed from the front.  The LM6700 has a silver frame.  I was not concerned that the stand on the LM7600 is silver.  Also, I figured that a 240 Hz refresh rate would be better than the 120 Hz refresh rate of the others when viewing fast, close-up action sports.  The LM7600's features combined with the 3D bundled deal of a free 3D Blu-ray player (backordered until August?)and more 3D glasses for only $100 more than the non-SMART, non-3D LS5700 made the deal for me.There are so many customer reviews that detail the positive features of this TV so I will not dwell on them.  This is a great TV and the picture calibration setting I used from Khang Nguyen's review posted 23 June 2012 yielded excellent results.So, why am I rating this TV at only two stars?1. The first one I received was defective right out of the box.  It was manufactured in May 2012.  The box showed no signs of shipping damage/mishandling and the unit itself did not show any signs of damage.  Upon initial power-up, the screen image had a dead spot of deactivated pixels measuring about 3.5\" high x 1.5\" wide.  After a few hours of use, the dead pixels did start to come alive and show the screen image, but with shadowing and not a full and clear image in that affected area.  Three days later, the image was as good as it was going to get. An outline of the defect remained and the image in that defective area remained blurry.  There was no sign of impact to the panel.  LG customer support noted that the unit is defective.  The condition could be limited to that one affected area or it could spread to the rest of the panel.  They suggested to seek a replacement through the place of purchase.Shipping damage is one thing and does not affect the quality of the product.  But when the product shows no sign of damage and does not work out of the box, that is a problem.  MINUS 1 STAR.2. Most of the TV programs I watch are through on-line sources.  I watch the programs I like on my schedule, when I can, not on the broadcaster's time and date schedule.  To my dismay, you can not watch ESPN3 because of the version of Adobe Flash Player contained in the TV's firmware.  Specifically, when accessing ESPN3, a new window appears citing \"Insufficient Flash Player Requirements\" and instructs you to an Adobe download page for the correct update to download version 11.2.  The problem is that Adobe Flash Player is part of the LG firmware and will only be updated when LG decides to update Flash Player in some future firmware update.  Who knows when that will be?  A call to LG yielded no answer - only that hopefully it will be contained in a future update!  MINUS 1 STAR.3. The inability to update Adobe Flash Player without LG firmware updates identified another potential issue.  The LM7600's operating system is Linux 32 bit, Safari.  The Adobe download page that appeared with the issue above noted \"Adobe Flash Player 11.2 will be the last version to target Linux as a supported platform.  Adobe will continue to provide security backports to Flash Player 11.2 for Linux.\"  So the operating system will have to be updated to keep up with the ever updating Adobe software products.I hope buyers of these 2012 models do not get the short end of the stick when an operating system update is released.  I can just see it where in order to fix an issue, the OS has to be updated.  But, in order to update the OS, there are hardware requirements to update as well.  And the 2012 TV's do not have that hardware to accept the new OS, so you'll have to buy a 2013 model.  I hope LG is smarter than that.4. There are a few previous customer reviews that note while MLB.com is part of the marketing features for the LM7600's product description and while the MLB.com's icon even appears on the box, it is still not available.  When you click on the MLB.com icon, you are still greeted with a \"Coming Soon\" page.So the product has been advertised for months and has promoted a feature that is still not available.  A great example of false advertising.5. Another Flash Player issue is with Yahoo! Finance videos.  Some news videos do play from the Yahoo! homepage but Yahoo! Finance videos do not play citing \"Insufficient Flash Player Requirements\" and directing the user to a Flash Player Update page just as described in #2 above.6. Apparently, Netflix will not run on a Linux operating system. So you have to use the LG Netflix app rather than accessing Netflix through the LM7600's web browser.The AccuWeather.com app is limited to the selection of preloaded cities.  The work-around is to use the web browser to access the fully functional web site.  Items 3 - 6 yields the loss of another star.Some reviewers have noted that it is a pain to change channels from DTV and cable and/or satellite.  If you hold down the channel + or - key, the channels are scrolled very quickly.  You are not waiting for the next channel to appear on the screen before you can change to the next channel.  You can index ahead some 50 channels in about a second.I wish there was a button on the remote to quickly change between inputs.  Having to select the \"Home\" screen or \"My Apps\" and then select the Input list and then select the desired input seems not well thought out.Also, I wish there was a FAV button on the remote so that you could quickly select and scroll through your favorite channels rather than accessing a menu and then a channel list and then a channel folder.  But, as I said, just hold down the channel +/- key and the channels index very quickly.A note on the unit's power supply.  Through my conversations with the LG tech reps, they did note that when the unit is not ON, power should be completely removed from the unit.  That means do not leave the unit in stand-by mode.  Considering the heat that a power supply generates when on but not powering the device and the small frame that houses the TV's components, the unit's life can be extended by taking care of the power supply.  Mine is plugged into a surge suppressor and the surge suppressor is plugged into a switched outlet so that when not in use, there is no power to the unit.I know that these SMART TV's are not a computer with a 47\" screen.  But I expect a brand new item to function as described out of the box and not require a replacement and also not require future, currently unavailable firmware updates to get what was advertised in the product description and pictured on the box.Amazon customer service was great but I am reviewing a LG TV not Amazon's customer service.  I received a replacement unit much sooner than expected while the product was still listed as \"Usually ships in 4 to 6 weeks\" on the product description.  Now that the unit is in stock, the price has increased as well.  The replacement unit was made in May 2012 as well.  I adjusted the picture settings to those from the noted reviewer and the resulting picture was better than on the partially defective first TV.  A firmware update from LG was available and I downloaded that without a problem.  But that firmware update did not fix any of the problems I outlined above.Will I keep this TV?  I can not answer that at this time.  But what is certain is that I do not want to be in a position of owning a 2012 model but the fix for what I outlined above is only available on the 2013 models!*****************UPDATE: It is a few hours later and I am reading my review on Amazon's product page for clarity.  Amazon has temporarily stopped selling the LM7600 model citing \"Item Under Review\" based upon customer feedback.  Maybe my feedback together with that of others is enough to get LG to correct the issues and deliver a product as advertised.*****************", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware, HDMI ARC Does not work on this TV", "Author": "David Y", "ReviewID": "RR9F023DE9ZCA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you're using this TV by itself, then it should work fine.

I'll start with the negatives. I'm not a fan of the software. The 7600 definitely suffers with the single core as far as speed. Sometimes commands don't register. Hitting a button multiple times with the remote cursor is sometimes necessary. Though I just did a software update today and have yet to experience this. As far as flashlighting, this example has some. Top left and right corners suffer from minor flashlighting. But obviously it's only noticeable on very dark scenes. It isn't as bad as some of the pictures I have seen of this model. Trim isn't the best quality plastic I've seen, but from a distance does look like brushed aluminum. Also, make sure you turn off smooth motion in the picture section of settings. It looks terrible (to me anyway).There really isn't much more to complain about so far, especially since this 47 inch TV was sub-1000 dollars.By far the best feature is the design. Very handsome thin TV and will add a lot to any room, especially when hung on a wall. Picture is very crisp, blacks, (except in the top corners) are nice, dark and even.

The TV audio out does not output in Dolby Digital if that is important to you, It was to me.

If your receiver does not have 3D pass thru, you'll need to input directly to the TV to receive 3D. My biggest complaint is with the Tru Motion feature.

It's just small enough that it's not shouting, look at me, I've got a huge TV, but big enough that it just kind of mentions it. :)  I had the 47LW6500 prior, and liked it so much, that I wanted to go a little bigger, especially for watching some 3D movies and playing 3D video games.  At first I didn't think that 55 was all that much bigger, even after comparing them at local stores, but once I got this home and saw it in my living room, it definitely stands out and is noticeably bigger. This TV is great, with only a few minor (taht sometimes seem major) downsides, which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars, and almost only gave it 3.  I'll list the cons first:CONS: As others have mentioned, there is some flashlighting on the corners, specifically the upper left, and lower right for me.  But it's not that bad that it's barely noticeable while watching the TV and only if you look for it when switching inputs and the screen goes black.  The motion remote, while functional, is designed terribly.  It appears that LG went for ergonomics over functional.  You can't set it down on without it falling over on its side.  Additionally, any bumping of the remote causes the cursor to come up on the screen.  My previous LG TV only came up if you pressed a button, and came with a full remote as well, which is also negated with this set.  What's nice is the old remotes work for this TV, but I want to sell my old TV and not hold back the remotes.  The CPU of this TV seems to be lacking.  Pressing the Home button and waiting about 5-10 seconds for the menu to come up so I can switch inputs, which I then have to click inputs, wait, and then click the one I want, seems like a lifetime most of the time.  Oh, and there seems to be quite a bit of input lag when trying to play 3D games, which negates playing online.  I had to give up on playing Call of Duty in 3D on this TV and go back to boring old 2 dimensions.PROS: Basically everything else.  The picture is crisp, especially after some configuration.  I used the picture wizard to set mine up as the settings I found suggested online made it seem dull and slightly bluish. I haven't noticed any motion blurring or the likes.  I love this TV, which is why I rounded up to 4 stars isntead of down to 3, despite the negative items I listed.  It's easy to remember the things that drive you nuts about a product, but I enjoy it far more than I hate it and don't regret buying it at the least.  I was keeping my eye on this when Amazon had it for $1469, and for one day, saw it listed for $1299 on here. I immediately heads to BB for a price match, I couldn't be happier!  Anyone want a 47LW6500? LOL.  Only recommendation I have is that you research sound bars.  I didn't know much about them, but I picked an LG one up at BB at the same time that runs off an optical cable, and unfortunately, seem to need to keep that remote handy for volume adjustments since the optical can't be controlled via the TV via the SimpLink.  Had I not purchased a sound bar, I wouldn't have noticed the vastly improved audio it provides.  So while I obviously wanted to get some things off my chest about this TV, the cons are all minor IMHO, and I highly recommend it.On one other note, I signed up for Amazon Prime, especially since my last LG had an amazon app that let me stream to it.  This one is lacking in that area, and LG informed me that this was a decision by Amazon. I contacted them and got a canned response about them being sorry and working on it, etc, etc.  No real reason as to why it's not provided yet.

The first one I received had a crack in the screen. While the standard LG packaging may be enough for some big box store, it seems to me that Amazon should be over-packing them for shipment. Anyway, when I saw the crack I went online and asked for a replacement. UPS showed up the next day to pick up the broken one and delivered the new one the day after. At least this one has no cracks.Last night I noticed that Amazon was no longer selling this directly, and there was a box on the page saying something about there being a problem and so they were no longer selling it. Now I see that that box is no longer on the page. Come on Amazon, tell us what is going on. Do we have defective units? Should we be returning them for some reason?Now for the set itself. The picture is great, but, could be better. Seems I'm spending more time tweaking than watching. I'm sure I'll get it right eventually. The so-called Magic Remote? Piece of junk. Ordering universal remote today. The menu system? Give me a break. It stinks. Especially when trying to switch between HDMI inputs. There has GOT to be a better way!

I of course agree and the set is extremely beautiful. Instead I will highlight the most important aspects of my daily use.Flashlighting. This is an edge lit LED display and like other sets, there is a very noticeable flashlight effect. However! During dark movies I do not notice this at all and the dimming seems to do a nice job. I also notice it come up during parts of video games that are all black with some text on screen to read. Not a deal breaker by any means, just be aware there IS flashlighting.The \"Wii\" remote: The remote that comes with the tv works like a Wiimote and is pretty easy to use, but the battery door on this thing is the biggest piece of junk I have ever had the pleasure of using. Lets just say there is a wonderful piece of tape holding it shut. Not worth taking a star off but UGH!PC Connectivity: I can output HDMI and Optical audio to the TV (free sound bar) with no issue. The TV shows up as a 3rd monitor with no issues and I can use XBMC to watch anything on my computer. This is the main reason for purchasing a TV and it looks fantastic on this panel.The \"Wifi\" PC connection and the \"Ethernet\" PC connection. I have Windows 7 so sharing media is quick and easy but only certain formats are supported over this Smart Share connection making it a pretty useless feature for me, go with the HDMI for better results.USB: I was able to plug a western digital my passport 1 TB drive into the USB and play just about any file, mp4, mkv, etc. Only draw back is this single core TV made the video playback from this source choppy and slow.

Now, to be honest I am not sure if it is this unit or this model or just the current LCD/LED Technology.The TV seems awesome, its appearance is spectacular and when you turn it on and start watching HD content it looks impressive. BUT, after a few minutes when you are cooling down from having bought such a cool TV set, the flaws become evident then:1. The most important and prominent flaw of the all, which without it I would have not rate it with 1 star but probably 4 is the now famous Flashlighting/clouding effect. This simply means that from the edge of the screen and some areas into the screen for about 10 inches, there are white spots that you would not notice in bright color pictures, but in black or dark scenes it becomes very obvious and annoying. I have done some research and it turns out that this is a defect in LCDs and LED TVs and apparently in all brands and all levels. In other words, it dont matter that you buy the super expensive 8000 series from Samsung, it too has reported this to happen. And apparently there is no fix but replacement of the unit, period. And apparently you would have to keep changing units until you are lucky to find one that does not have this flaw.It seems to me that it is very VERY ridiculous that this expensive TVs have this flaw. Usually \"you get what you pay for\" but in this case it does not seem that way. I do not have the chance to return this unit and so I am stuck with a 1800 USD TV Set that seems like an old unit banged by kids when showing dark scenes in movies and programs. I might have bought the less expensive series of LG or Samsung instead as paying more does not guarantees even a basic normal video quality.Now, that being said let me take the opportunity to point out two more flaws with this unit: (again, may be the unit, the model or the technology)2. I notice some judder in normal motion not even fast or super fast. In other words, just a man walking across the room at normal speed would cause a judder along the edge of the man. To me it seems unreal that you would pay so much for a tv set that cannot even show you normal common activities without jittering and artifacts. I can understand in super fast motion activities but not in normal motion. And I did try the true motion and all different settings, it was the same or maybe slightly less but still noticeable.3. The LED Area Dimming apparently its a new \"advance\" in the LED Technology. but to me its was distractive and created an abnormal effect while watching a movie. In many moments of the movie I could see how the brightness of a part of the screen would increase and decrease constantly even with the same picture frame up on the screen. In other words, it was not that a scene changed and was brighter, no, it was a man talking in a black suit and the suit would become brighter and darker as if the TV was adjusting the LED dimming. I turned this \"special feature\" off and it stopped doing that.Just in case you wonder, YES I have tried every setting in all combinations I could possible think of, I have researched and looked into internet for every possible solution or settings, etc. And there was no solution other than compromise and accept it. As I said, I cant change the unit, I am stuck with it.SO, My recommendation for others out there is:1. Think that it may be possible that you would have to return the unit if it has flaws and consider whether you have that option or not. If you can not return the unit then consider buying a plasma or a PLED TV (Plasma with LED Tech combined) so you don't take any chances.If you can return it then buy it and if it is damaged, return it.2. If you are not rich and have sweated your money like most of us, understand that buying the more expensive does not guarantee picture quality. Apparently these TV sets are experimenting with new technology but are already selling it without having tested it thoroughly. So maybe you are better off just buying a TV set of the 2010 or 2011 series and not necessarily of the upper series but regular series and you would probably get the same. I say this because the other day I watched a movie in my IN-LAWS who recently bought an LCD TV 43 Inches at 500 USD and I enjoyed the entire movie without any distraction at all. But in my 1800 USD TV set I kept stopping the movie trying to change settings as it was distractive.(And no, my IN-LAWS are not A/V engineers, I too set up their TV set.)In summary. You will find many great reviews and many awful reviews. I will just leave you with this: IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY AN EXPENSIVE TV, MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN RETURN IT TO THE STORE IF YOU DONT LIKE IT OR IF IT HAS FLAWS. AN EXPENSIVE TV IS NOT GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL BE THE BEST. IF YOU LOVE HOW IT LOOKS AFTER SEVERAL DAYS, GREAT FOR YOU!!! BUT IF AFTER SEVERAL DAYS YOU SEE ITS NOT WHAT IT PROMISED, RETURN IT AND KEEP T AT IT UNTIL YOU DO GET THE UNIT THAT SATISFY YOU. WE ARE THE CUSTOMERS AND IT IS UP TO US TO DEMAND HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS FOR THESE PRICES, SO MAYBE IF WE KEEP RETURNING THE TV SETS THAT DO NOT SATISFY US, MAY THEN THEY WILL STOP SELLING PRODUCTS NOT FULLY TESTED OR WITH FLAWS.Just one more thing. The 2D to 3D conversion is rather useless as the result is a very unnatural looking picture. Its is FUN and INTERESTING but not a serious feature. I did not mind as I did not expect much of it. There is a reason why you need a 3D Bluray and 3D media. so the 2D to 3D is more to play with it rather than a deal breaker.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "BEWARE!", "Author": "E.A.

Overall, I am happy with everything. But I have a some nits to pick.First, the praise... The 47LM7600 3D Smart HDTV is an excellent video with a nice width of Internet capabilities. That, alone would rate it 5 stars based on quality & functionality versus price.The first nit is that the NB3520A Sound Bar & Subwoofer do not work with the HDTV remote's control, and it cannot show the sound control settings on-screen.  A separate control is needed for each.  There are a variety of solutions. For example, I have a third-party universal remote that works for all components. But LG should have integrated the functionalities and not have required me to acquire and program a third-party remote.  It's worth noting here, in comparison, that the HDTV remote integrates well with the non-LG Verizon FiOS set-up box.The second nit is that the HDTV's Internet apps are not integrated with the BP620 Blueray player apps. There should be no duplication, no overlap, nor any requirement to select/juggle between the two.If this was an assemblage of multiple vendors' products, I could better understand the lack of good integration and the need for a third-party universal remote.I posted politely-worded reviews on LG's customer site, but they were rejected because (LG said) they did not meet the site's guidelines.  It would have been nice if they had read and responded to the substance of my reviews.Since the combination of HDTV, Blueray player, and a sound system is ubiquitous, the lack of good integration is a serious product design mistake. The lack of customer sensitivity from LG is icing on the cake. I'm knocking-off two stars from the rating.

(I did not want to worry about burn-in or image retention of the plasma, so went with LED.)My experience - I decided to take a chance on this TV, despite the negative reviews regarding the flash lighting and edge bleed. Unfortunately, it was intolerable. I experienced major edge bleed and flash lighting from all around the edges of the TV when black. Worse yet, these spots were uneven with the biggest spot in upper center and a similar spot from the lower right. It looked like it was \"broken.\"  I tried calibrating, changing settings, back light, etc etc. no luck.I returned the TV and decided not to roll the dice on a replacement based upon the negative reviews here. I instead went with the Samsung UN55ES7100  and I am quite happy with that TV. These issues simply do not exist on it. It was a little more expensive but worth it.Some good points - I can say that the LG looks beautiful and the magic remote is pretty nifty.

having.  Footage is from Tangled copyright Disney.This will mark the fourth iteration of this review and hopefully the last.  With each revision the length increased dramatically so I am re-writing from scratch.  Starting off with just the highlights:Pros:-3D looks awesome on this TV (when it works right)-Service technician was knowledgeable-Smart TV apps were better than expected-Integrates perfectly with my NAS and streams movies smoothly via WiFi-Personally I love the magic remote!-2D to 3D conversion is actually useful-Replacement glasses are cheap, if you wear glasses I recommend LG AG-F220 Cinema Clip On 3D Glasses for 2011 and 2012 LG 3D LED-LCD HDTVs so that you can prevent glare between your glasses and the 3D glasses-Sound is pretty good-Web browser is good-The stand looks nice, it swivels well despite the weight of the TV-ARC rendered my need for several inputs on the receiver obsolete-It's smart!  I had this hooked up to a Yamaha RX-V673 7.2-Channel Network AV Receiver and it would find the Blu-Ray player connected to the receiver and it was able to turn it on.  Because it was a LG player it was also able to do limited controls on that as well.  It can turn on my PS3 too!-Very smooth picture, refresh rate is greatCons:-Help line was anything but helpful-3D boards were bad on two sets in a row!-Power supply fuse went bad within three weeks-It's a shame that you have to EXPECT some light bleed.  First set was so-so, second was moderate-Struggles to show colors in dark scenes, they're just not there-A little laggy on video games unless in game mode and input switched to PC name, measured lag at >108 ms before making changes-Magic remote loses connection to TV about once a week and stops working and will suddenly 'install' a new magic remote-Had to put the contrast at 99 via the Wow: World of Wonder [Blu-ray] calibration Blu-Ray to make the settings look good, no more room for adjustment-Glare, almost as bad as a plasma-Expensive (but new technology often is)If you need more details here is a shortened version of the review I had up previously:Purchased this TV from HHGregg, got it home and hooked it up. A little bit of light bleed, I figured I won the panel lottery. Hooked up my blu-ray player, PS3, laptop, etc and started watching media. I had a backlog of 3D movies that I bought just for this TV so I started watching Tangled. Watched the whole movie and it was okay. Nothing spectacular. When it gets to the scene at the end with the lanterns and they are moving about there was a lot of ghosting and cross-talk so I pulled up the menu and adjusted the settings on a paused screen and that fixed 90% of the issue. By the time the movie was done I was having trouble focusing on objects in real life with my glasses off and I felt sick to my stomach.It was during Avatar 3D however when I was taking off my glasses to rub my eyes that I realized things were wrong in a different way. That is the easiest way to explain the issue.  The screen displays two superimposed images an inch or so apart, the glasses block out one image and leave the two spaced images for the brain to bring together. In normal 3D these are a fixed distance apart or only come together or drift apart when an object moves closer to or further from the screen. With this TV though they were shifting independently, even crossing the center axis and coming out on the other side, literally making you cross-eyed.That's when the calls to LG started. They focused on the Blu-Ray player, an LG BD670. They had me update the firmware, change the firmware, and change it again. They ignored the fact that the PS3 had the same issues and the TV had the same issues with the built in 2D to 3D conversion. After a few days of back and fourth they admitted defeat and wanted to send out a service technician. Being that the TV was only 11 days old I opted instead to exchange it. I bought this TV especially for the 3D so for it to have this issue was a deal killer.I got the new TV home, unboxed, and hooked up. Immediately I put in a 3D blu-ray. Same setup as before, and it seemed to look fine for a while.  While in the settings I noticed that the menu options were different than before. I figured I needed to update the firmware so I did.  The light bleed was much worse than before and no combination of backlight/brightness/local dimming could fix it this time.  Worse yet when I went to watch a 3D movie again the issue was just as bad as before.I called LG back and explained what had happened. They struggled to figure out what I was talking about. Apparently the notes in my file from all my previous calls were all about my Blu-Ray player and there was nothing about the TV. So they were lost. Basically we started over. Upgrading the firmware again, testing connections, resetting the system, etc.  That didn't help. The next tech insisted that I shouldn't have updated using the flash drive (even though they told me to do it on the previous call) and had me update using the TV which put me again at the same version. That didn't fix things. Then again focusing on the blu-ray player. Asking if I knew if I was putting in a 3D Blu-Ray? Am I using a HDMI cable? Frustrating to say the least. They would not listen to the actual problem and I had to stop and insist that they actually hear me out. When finally they did that they again said that they would need to send out a tech.A week later an LG tech came out, he was very knowledgeable and he apologized for the customer service over the phone as they are not experts, they just follow a script. He watched the TV for a few minutes and said it was a bad 3D board. Apparently the 3D board is affixed to the main panel so the whole screen (probably 70% of the TV) needed to be replaced.  Two in a row, must be a bad batch he commented.A few weeks later parts arrived and he installed the new screen/3D board.  After replacing the parts the TV would not power up, the power supply had died.  He hot-wired the TV to run and ordered a new power supply .  That left me on screen #3 with a new 3D board and finally... finally it was working right.  The flash-lighting on screen 3 isn't as bad as screen 2 but it's worse than screen 1.  Finally a little over a month after I purchased the first TV the tech came back out and replaced the power supply.  A week or so later I was adjusting the 3D settings and realized that I was having the same issues with the 3D again, I put them back to the default settings and things worked right again.  I have seen this complaint on other forums.Finally I have the TV I expected from the start.  It's not perfect, issues with low lighting, flash-lighting, customer service, input lag, etc.  But I no longer regret buying it.  It's just amazing how many things can crop up after a purchase like this that you didn't even consider before the purchase.  Hopefully this review gives buyers some more information to consider.Edit: 6/24/13 A few months of good service and suddenly the television would not change inputs.  Well, it would say it changed but the screen would be black no matter what I had chosen.  Also the Simplink that allows the TV to turn on and off the Blu-Ray player, PS3, and receiver stopped working entirely.  Called customer service again (and struggled to listen to them read their script) and they scheduled an appointment.  They called first and discussed the issue and figured it would be the main board.  They ordered a new one, showed up and replaced the main board.  After 2 hours of them tinkering with it the issue was not resolved.  Looking at the repair history of our unit they determined that putting another screen and more into it would be uneconomical and they deemed it irreparable.  LG called the store that I purchased it from and worked out a deal to let me return it and get a new TV of my choice with store credit.  Unfortunately the new models just came out so there is nothing in that price range any more.  Kudos to LG for helping me out, unfortunately the help was necessary in the first place.

(LG is Korean).The manufacturer has some serious QC issues to deal with here.Like many others, my set has a severe top edge light bleeding problem and it is more pronounced in the corners.This is particularly annoying when watching movies (top and bottom horizontal black bars) or any black or gray image content in that area.Upon further inspection, I find there is a little bit of play/ give in those corner when putting my finger to the panel.Pressing it ever so gently makes the light bleed worse. So this means that the panel is too close to the back in those areas.It gets worse, as I stand on the right hand side of the TV, facing its flank and looking from above (one eye closed), I can see the whole right side is bent/ concave instead of being straight. This certainly isn't helping the light bleeding issue.PROS: the design is really nice, 4 HDMI and 3 USB ports, passive 3D (love it) thought the glasses are a little too big.CONS: the remote control is OK but it needs a dedicated key to bring up the list of input sources. Operation is sluggish. Look at the LM8600 with dual-core instead of LM7600.

Anytime the TV scene was dark, you could clearly see the LED lights shining through from both of the top corners and the middle of the screen.  To me, this was both distracting and looked terrible on what is supposed to be an amazing picture and I could not fix it with calibration settings or anything else.  My understanding is that this issue is more prevalent on some sets than others and could be caused by handling during delivery, so it might not be a problem with every set.  Rather than risk having the same problem again though, I decided to send it back and spend a couple of hundred more and go with the Panasonic P60ST50 60\" Plasma.My other issues with the TV were mostly minor and/or completely subjective, so should be taken with a grain of salt.  I thought the wii-like controller was cool at first, but quickly became an annoyance with the pointer quickly disappearing when trying to make selections or having to point it at a wall when I needed to choose something towards the edge of the screen.  I also never had a problem w 3d before in theaters and heard passive was the best, but I was getting headaches and dizzy almost immediately when using it here.

This TV's black levels are about 2.5 stars. They're good but nowhere close to what a Plasma at the same price point (or less) can do. The Smart Menu is crowded and not as well thought out as on the 2012 Samsung TV's. Input sources (your DVD player, Game Console, Cable or Satellite box, etc.) can't be changed from the remote control. You'll need to go into the menu to do that, and while it's not that inconvenient, it's unquestionably less convenient than pressing a button on a remote, which by the way, is something practically EVERY other TV can do. Speaking of the Wii-like motion remote, even at it's slowest setting it's not as accurate as a conventional remote. When you consider that you'll have to master it just to change inputs, the remote becomes just as inconvenient as the lack of a dedicated input button is. LG has constructed the remote from piano gloss plastic too, so it's a major fingerprint magnet. The remote's battery door is the strangest you'll find on any TV remote (but all things considered, appropriate for this one). The door has a flimsy hinge. Some critics have commented on how easily it breaks, which appears at least, to be as easy as they've said. The remote won't sit upright on a flat surface, so get used to parking it next to you on the couch, or practice balancing it on the arm of your chair. Whereas most TV remotes are the sort that you can drop one without picking up a scratch, I wouldn't trust this remote not to break if dropped, and scratches are a sure thing. When this TV if off, it's the most beautiful TV ever made (at least so far). The panel is a black slate that seems to independently float above the stand. In fact, the TV looks so good on the outside that you might be momentarily temped to keep it as decoration and buy a different TV to watch.  Some have griped about the stand being plastic, but it's actually sturdy, heavy, and of metal and plastic construction. The panel itself is super thin; the thinnest on the market today, and would look beautiful mounted on a wall. Unfortunately, it's not as pretty when it's on, and thanks to a narrow black border, it's not the window-like TV that some reviewers have described.  After calibration, black levels are good, not great, some motion blur exists, and the TV exhibits average screen uniformity. If you're looking at this LG for gaming, you probably can't go wrong. But if you're planning on using it for everything, you should probably look at a Plasma. These days, it's a TV lottery. Either you get a good one in the box, or you get a bad one - but even if you get a good 55LM7600 in box, the TV still isn't as good as it could be - or should be - especially for what it costs. There's always some flash lighting with any LCD TV, but too much isn't acceptable on a TV at this price point.

Menus are not logic and user friendly. Software seems a little laggy.2. Glossy Screen - I know this is a very common thing but I hated it. Looked awful in my home and very difficult to see during the day.3. Bleeding - Corners, edges you choose this TV has it! Bleeding like a murder scene. 1st TV had this, requested a new TV, got it (after being stood up during my delivery window by shipper and having to wait another day) and exact same issue but even worst!! Double the bleeding. For anyone that hasn't seen this before it means that whenever you watch a movie that's a little darker or a movie with black borders, during darker viewing conditions you will see the affected areas much lighter than the surrounding or even grey instead of black as in my issue. Problem seems to get worst the longer the TV is on for some reason. Played with every possible setting nothing helps but having the backlighting below 10/100, which renders the TV useless. During regular bright TV you wont see it the issue but in a darker movie you will only be looking at this. When you change inputs there is 3-4 seconds of black screen, which looks absolutely ridiculous. I know this is a issue with Edge lit TVs but this is supposed to be LED+ top of the range, better quality control should be run!I wanted to love this product but I hated it. You might get lucky and get one that has gone through proper quality control but for now I will put my DLP back on until I see something in the marketplace that is better quality and easier to use.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Shipped Broken.", "Author": "Kyle S Masters", "ReviewID": "R1NMMA4079QU8Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Shipped in the factory box, no double boxing, Screen shattered.

The price and sales from Amazon were fantastic as usual.  The TV was simple to set up and get working very quickly.  The features are incredibly vast and fun.  But the Magic Remote supplied with the TV is horrible.  It is a hand held pointer gun that forces the user to go thru a lot of annoying pointing and clicking.  There may be some way to modify the pointer speed and performance, but so far I haven't found it.  Some of the most annoying things about it are that it frequently skips the icon/item you are trying to click and you have to go back and try again, often over and over.  This might not be so bad, if the pointer didn't shut off after a few seconds of use making your previous efforts futile.  I truly loathe this remote, it makes the entire viewing experience a nightmare.I just spent over an hour yoyoing between LG Customer Support and their preferred parts supplier for the east coast.  After almost a half hour I finally got thru to the LG CSR that I'm not interested in spending more time practicing with the Magic Motion remote, but that I want to buy a working alternative.  I got the impression that he finally understood what I was saying, and he offered to \"patch\" me thru to the east coast parts supplier and explain to them what Im looking for.  This sounded good to me because I'd just spent about 15 minutes previously with this parts provider just to have them tell me the TV was too new to have any parts listed.  Ouch.  Well, the \"patched\" call didn't work either, as the parts supplier CSR understood from the LG CSR that I wanted a replacement remote and not a new alternative one.  So what I'm now stuck with is basically having a standard HDTV with drastically reduced functionality, because using all the alternate bells and whistles depends on Magic Motion remote.  What a major bummer :(UPDATE: 8/25/2012Dear shoppers, please accept my apologies for the hasty and harsh manner in which I wrote the above review.  I went on line yesterday (9/24) and wrote an update which retracted a lot of the negativism from the review.  Apparently, Amazon didn't receive the update or they chose not to print it.  Well here goes again (said sheepishly)I was wrong! The MM Remote is NOT HORRIBLE.  In fact, now that I've been able to tweek its settings, I'm getting quite used to it.  My difficulties with the MM Remote stemmed from me not having found the solutions earlier on.  After finally figuring out how to adjust the pointer size and speed, it became much easier for me to use.  However, the problem with the Smart TV UI blinking off after a short period of time persists.  I still haven't found a way to fix that.  If anyone knows how, I'd appreciate hearing from you.I also learned in the user guide that the TV supports the use of wireless mice and keyboards which purportedly work much the way they do with a PC, except that the mouse only functions exactly like the MM Remote.  Therefore, you won't have access to all the functionality that's normally associated with a PC mouse when accessing the internet.  As a caution, LG does offer a caveate that not all wireless input devices coexist peacefully with all wireless networks adapters. When I'm able to actually get around to setting up my wireless input devices, I hopefully will be able to compare the ergonomic functionality between the MM Remote and KB/Mouse setup.  Didn't see anything written about using Blue Tooth devices, so not sure if they would work or not.In conclusion, I changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars and would gladly change it to 5 stars if/when I can find a solution to the smart interface UI disappearances.Good shopping and I hope you find this update much more helpful than the original :)  Thanks,Dennis", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value, Wonderful TV, Frustrating Picture Settings", "Author": "appletim", "ReviewID": "R2B5XEVJT9U1U9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm writing this review after receiving my screen yesterday, and using it for about a day.  Here are some initial impressions and notes:1) Picture Calibration and SettingsThis is really the one and only aspect of this screen that is absolutely maddening and frustrating!!  Here's why:- All of my settings that I've carefully configured are automatically changed by the TV!  (i.e. - I switched from the antenna to Hulu Plus, and lost all of my settings)- It's can be difficult to get the picture settings quite right.- It's very hard to find official LG support or online resources for proper calibration.- Because a living room dynamically changes (lighting, etc) it would be great to find one group of settings that would be optimal.  (it's crazy for the average user to try and adjust settings for different times of the day, as well as the dozens of different app and input options.  You could have hundreds of combinations.)  As a technical user, I'd love to spend some time tweaking the settings for my use, and then never have to worry about them again.2) Magic RemoteI work in the technology field, so I'm more technical than most users, and even I find this remote a little ergonomically awkward to use.  My parents would go crazy with this remote.3) Home Screen and App InterfaceThis interface is quite busy.  I find myself just going to my AppleTV instead.  It pretty much has all of the same features (and more), and is worth the $95 for the benefits.4) HDMI InputsThey are very close to the edge of the display.  So go for 90 degree HDMI cables if you can.5) Design and PresenceOverall, a very nice design.6) Color, Blacks, ContrastOverall, I find the picture to be quite pleasant.  Out of the box, skin tones looked horrible, hence my strong desire to get the picture settings just right.

Waited over a month for software upgrade, watching limitless content on my laptop, iPad, and iPhone, and limited content on my TV.Software Upgrade did not fix it.  Dealer says too late to return it.  LG support says that it has a full web browser, but not full video capabilities, suggesting that the Smart TV is more intended for checking emails, and that I should hook a laptop to the TV to watch videos.

My $90 Blueray player gives me more access to the web than this TV.  And it has a querty pad on the back of the remote, covering the \"easier access\" part.(I know I misspelled querty. I'm wrong, and just like it better that way.  It's one of my qwirks.)The worst part is customer support.  Cheerful, but not able to fix design flaw.  Unable to say when upgrade software will be available or what the upgrade will achieve.  I have spoken to 6 or more people at LG, and get 6 different stories about how Amazon will not work.  I called Amazon, and they said they have made flash player data available to LG, but LG has not chosen to include it in their smart TV's.The irony is that I bought the TV to make it simpler to watch TV, and it is actually less simple than my old Visio (cheap) TV.  By the way, Visio sent me a free remote when I had a problem, on the first and only call I made to tech support.  They did not transfer me to warranty, supervisor, etc.  They just sent it.I think I need to redefine what Smart means.

There's no way to make the advertisements go away.I bought a TV to play the content I choose, not to get advertised at.

It takes almost a minute to click the \"my apps\" menu, wait for the menu to show up, select the \"change input\" app, then select a different input... it takes almost a minute to switch between Apple TV and Roku.

I decline and I can no longer use the magic wand remote to control the TV without the revised terms of service agreement popping up.

We were talked out of a plasma or a Samsung into this model by the sales guy. He was pretty knowledgeable but failed to mention an issue with these LED TV's which ultimately ended up being the reason I took it back.Apparently, LED and LCD TV's have this inherent problem of ghosting. It's a blurring of the picture with fast movement. If a character waves his hand quickly and close to the camera, there will be a blurring of the hand. Any quick motion that is close up produces a certain amount of this ghosting. It has to do with the refresh rate of the TV. This one is 240 hz which was supposed to solve this problem. Not so much. I should say too that the picture on this TV is utterly beautiful...except for this annoying problem.Before I knew what this was, I thought it was a setting or something that could be fixed. I called Geek Squad, and they were clueless. The wanted to send a tech out.  Then I called LG directly. The admitted that these LED TV's do tend to do this but is can be reduced by tweaking the settings. This did not resolve the problem enough for me to be satisfied, so after 30 days, I returned the set to BB and wound up getting a 60\" Samsung plasma which, by the way, has a 600 hz refresh rate.

Toral \"C.T.\"", "ReviewID": "R24L7SNSC1TE3I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really hyped about this TV, I had recently purchased an amazing Panasonic Plasma and realized even though the picture was the best I had ever seen and the blacks were inky black and all that good stuff, that the TV was simply too hot for my room. I figured I could find an LED with a picture that I could at least live with since I couldn't have the plasma. I did some research and this TV sounded like a good candidate. I was infatuated with the sleek design, the great features, all the good reviews people had given the TV and also that the TV boasted about having good black levels.When I got the TV, almost immediately as it was out of the box I was disappointed, the stand was plastic, not the metal or stainless steel that it looks like in the photo. Once set up it was incredibly wobbly whenever you tried to shift its angle on the stand, it definitely made me worry about the safely of the set. After the TV was set up and I had calibrated the picture to my liking and set up the TV on my wifi network I began to play around with the TV's features. Off the bat noticed there was some major uniformity issues and what is called the dirty screen effect. It looks as if you're looking out a dirty window during motion scenes, it's not a pleasant viewing experience. The dark screen uniformity was pretty bad too with a big white ghost in the top right corner and a less visible one in the left corner. The motion smoothing option on the TV was the worst I've seen yet and I've owned MANY LED and Plasma televisions. It plain old didn't do what it was supposed to do, I'm someone that does like this option and  I like seeing the smoothed out motion of the image. This TV did not do that, it smoothed the image to an extent but if it the scene went too fast the picture would simply pixilate. Dark scenes were pretty nice for an LED I must admit, it of course doesn't compare to a plasma. I was willing to possibly move past these flaws because the 3D option on the TV was so good!One of the good things I could say about the TV was that the 3D was fantastic, it was so great to play my video games and be able to switch the picture from 2D - 3D, also Blu Ray films in 3D are a phenomenal! Another good thing I thought were the connections in the back, it had a good amount of HDMI outlets (4) along with everything else. That's really all I can say that I enjoyed on the television. To get back to what was wrong, the smart apps were nothing to fuss about and it was not worth the extra money you have to dish out for a TV like this. The Netflix constantly interrupted or crashed along with any other applications I ran, the TV ran rather slow; I got fed up with the \"Magic Remote\" after a week and began to hate it. I was also very disappointed that the TV didn't have Pandora as a downloadable app, or any free music radio app. The cherry on top was when I saw the black bars across the screen, during any fast motion scene you would see black bars strip across the screen. I called LG to find out what was wrong with the TV and they verified that it was defective.I then arranged to return it to Amazon, since then I have sent it back, received a full refund for what I paid for the TV and purchased the Panasonic VIERA TC-L55ET5 55-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D Full HD IPS LED-LCD TV. Currently waiting for it to arrive. All in all the TV was poorly made, it's cheap, lots of great ideas poorly executed.

So I get an LG 55LM6200 because quite a few salespeople and reviewers had said \"The human eye cannot see the difference between 120 and 240 Hz.\" Armed with doubt, but a 14 day no question return policy I took it home. Lies, big difference. Motion blur, ghosting, I do not know if one is because of the other, but none the less another take back. Enter thisLG 55LM7600,got it, no cracks, looks great! Let down, flashing during a 3D movie, about 6 times in the first 3D movie I watched. It was a new movie too us so I put a movie in that we had already watched and I knew had no flashing. Flashing is worse, 6 times in the first 30 min. One more movie, already watched on my other 3D TV bought in 2011. Flashing 9 times in first half hour.

This lg has really good reviews on amazon and other sites, but it has been a disappointment for the following reasons:1) the picture quality is not as good as the 2 yr old Samsung.  I haven't adjusted any settings yet so maybe it can be made to look better, but out of the box it doesn't look as good.2) the smart functionality isn't as useful as I expected.  First there's no pandora app.  My $100 wireless blu ray player came with the pandora app and this $2500 tv does not.  Lame.  Even worse is the limited functionality of the web browser.  There is no way to make web videos full screen.  When I called lg to ask about these limitations, the customer service rep recommended that I get a ruku!?!?!  That's not what I expected after I got a smart tv.In general, we've been happy with lg products (have lg vacuum, washer/dryer, LCD tv), but I would not recommend this tv, and I even feel like we got it for a good price ($1500).

I also expect any new television worth owning to be compatible with common online services such as Amazon Video, whether through the internet interface or an app.  2012 LG TVs are not.

I was going to return the item, but luckily I tested one of my computers that has HDMI. It worked just the way it suppose to with expected picture quality. However, the reason why I came here and raised the stars all the way from 1 to 4 is because of how low the risk you're taking when purchasing from Amazon!!!!!!!!!! On thursday evening I ordered the TV return to Amazon and today, Monday morning the UPS guy came to pick it up. I was like wow. Amazon doesn't joke around with customer satisfaction, and I read it in many other reviews who purchased this TV. I've been shopping here for over a year and will now generally shop at Amazon, because I know I'm not going to be let down.I kept the TV.TV has a beautiful picture, no less than high end brand I saw at Fry's. I was going to buy Sony, because it's the \"best\". but I learned in one of their best TV's negative reviews that customer service didn't help when they were suppose to, the client was basically burned, paying twice as much for such TV. I don't believe in positive anecdotes, I read only the worst case scenarios when investing. So I decided to go for cheaper brand, little that I knew cheaper doesn't mean worse in today's world! It's actually better, wise investors know what I mean.You know how documentary videos look clean and actual movies look blurrier on old TV's?

Ultimately though, I returned it. The 2D performance was good and definitely superior to my 4.5-year-old Sony XBR4 (which had cost more than twice as much!), but I was disappointed by the 3D performance. I had chosen this passive 3D TV because I had been scared off of active 3D by the flicker problem, but contrary to LG's advertising their Cinema 3D does not work the same way as the 3D in theatres. Passive 3D cannot emit both a left and right pixel from the same physical pixel, so the 3D effect is created by interleaving lines of left-eye pixels with lines of right-eye pixels. This means that the TV is only showing you half as much visual information as competing TVs that use active 3D. When you're watching a 1080p title in 3D, each eye sees only a 1920x540 image rather than 1920x1080.My hope was that it would look good anyway, but it didn't. I tested it with three titles: Cave of Forgotten Dreams 3D and Underworld: Awakening 3D--both in 720p--and Alice in Wonderland 3D in 1080p. On the first two, the 3D was so bad that it was almost unwatchable. In Cave of Forgotten Dreams, there was tons of flickering during vertical panning due to the passive 3D interleaving, and on both titles I felt like I had to make an extra effort to focus my eyes. Alice in Wonderland actually looked good though. Perhaps since it was in 1080p the 3D interleaving was not as big of a problem. However, I bought an active 3D TV--the Panasonic TC-P55VT50 plasma, one of the highest-rated TVs for both 2D and 3D picture quality--to compare them side-by-side and the active 3D was still much better even on Alice in Wonderland. The sense of depth on the passive 3D was much more subtle than with the active 3D (something that many other reviewers have noticed). Not to mention that the colour and contrast on the TC-P55VT50 were spectacular. Cave of Forgotten Dreams also looked much better on the Panasonic. There were no problems with focusing or with vertical panning. Interestingly though, that movie did reveal a flaw in the Panasonic too: the cross-talk issue that is common to active 3D with some content. But it was still much nicer to watch on the Panasonic. I didn't bother comparing Underworld.I also noticed some strange artifacting in 2D with the LG. I was watching some show and I had paused it, but I noticed that the image on the TV was moving back and forth very slightly, as if the TV's image processing was trying to compensate for some imagined deficiency in the content. I only saw this once, though.In the end, there was no contest between the two TVs. The Panasonic was twice the price, but it is easily three or four times the TV that the LG was, even for 2D. On the plus side, the Amazon return process was slick and I got back everything I paid less a measly $6 UPS pick-up fee.Overall, this LG is a good TV and an excellent value, it just wasn't good enough for me. If you are still considering purchasing it, you should also consider the 47LM6700. The only difference is 240 Hz processing versus 120 Hz processing, which is completely unnoticeable in almost all situations.", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice! But...", "Author": "R.

He came here, only telling that he didn't know the cause of the product and needed to order parts from LG factory in Texas and I need to wait 7-8 days for it. Now I'm sitting here with NO TV, while Superbowl is tomorrow. I think LG needs to improve the reliability of its product. I don't think LG's product is ready for a mature market like US. I'm worried that with over $1200's investment, even if my TV gets fixed eventually, should I buy extended warrantty from my own pocket, because the TV can break down again next year when the manufacturer's one year warrantty expires. It sucks to think that your $1200 investment is thrown into a sink. This is the worst TV product I have bought in the US for more than 20 years when I was buying solely Japanese TV products.Update: After waiting two weeks, LG repairmen finally came to my house. It took them a couple of hours. They replaced both the control board and the screen. Now the TV works like anew. My only complaint was that LG did not give me extended warranty on the parts that were replaced. My manufacturer warranty still expires on the original 1-year purchase anniversary.

Back it was going. Amazon readily provided pickup and a refund. As I was packing up the TV, I noticed that there was no remote in the box.

I have been a big buyer of products off Amazon for years. But never again. First off, this TV is outstanding, I love it and have enjoyed many evenings watching videos and network tv. The problem is NOT with the TV. The problem is with Amazon. When I bought the TV, I had a membership in Amazon Prime which allowed for free shipping, 1 free book on Kindle a month and free unlimited instant video online streaming. I'd had Netflix and dropped it after I had signed up for Prime membership thinking this was a much better deal.Herein, lies the problem. Now one would really think that if you bought a television from Amazon and that Amazon sold memberships in their Prime membership with free instant streaming video, that you'd be able to watch the streaming video on that new TV, right? WRONG!!! I had to go to Amazon's website to find out how to set up the television to watch the streaming instant video. This took me to a site for TV registration and I had to go through the list of LG televisions to find this new TV. IT ISN'T listed. Not only that, but there are only TWO new televisions listed for all of 2012. Almost all the televisions they have listed (for LG, Sony, et al)are 2011 and earlier; very few smart tv's are listed. I immediately contacted Amazon and was told by Indian customer service, that \"no you won't be able to watch streaming video on your new tv because it does not have the Amazon app (which is needed). I was absolutely stunned. I mean, WHY would Amazon sell TV's that don't even support their own products they are trying to sell? If you look at what TV's are supported, the TV's are older models, and I didn't see any (other than 2 LG's for Google TV) that were supported for Amazon. This is kind of dumb. On the one hand, they are selling membership in their Prime membership, advertising it as having free unlimited streaming video, as an alternative to Netflix and yet they don't bother telling their customers in fine print or anything, that oh by the way, you won't be able to watch the streaming video unless your TV has an Amazon app. I find this incredible for a company's business model.

I guess their products are not expected to last beyond 1 year. Never again.There are two types of electronics companies.  The one type like Sony, Pioneer and Intel test their products rigorously to ensure extreme reliability over an industry standard of 7 years.

After trying to enter it three times and failing, I noticed that the TV is set to only acccept a maximum of 32 characters. This makes it impossible for me to have this TV connect to my network, unless I drastically shorten my password, thus making my network less secure.  I tried contacting LG support several times, but this issue is way over their heads.  The internet is an important feature of this TV, so the inability to be able to connect to my network is very disappointing.I just received an email back from LG support and they stated that \"the device is compatible with WEP and WPA, not WPA2.\" This seems quite odd to me for a new wireless device in 2012.

It is excellent and by tweaking the video the cinematic quality actually reaches stunning.  It is much better than the JVC 47 inch it replaced.  I moved the JVC to my bedroom and although both TV's are 1080p the LG picture is clearer (when it works).3D is good in all modes and even the 2d - 3d conversion is great and fun.  I have not been terribly impressed with 3d movies even in the theatres but this lives up to what I have seen.  I sure wish Avatar (the one movie I was really impressed with) was available on Blu-Ray.  PlayStation 3 gaming in 3D is incredible!  I am astounded at the quality in Grand Tourismo 5!The speakers are really good an I am truly impressed with the sound.  It is good enough that in order to save energy I often run all my audio through the TV rather than my 7.1 surround.OK now for my complaint.  The communication on the HDMI ports is awful and has been since day one.  It doesn't connect to my Sony DVP-995 400 disk DVD player at all.  The connections through my Onkyo which uses HDMI 1.4 connections is sporadic and poor.  Even when switching video modes it will often see \"no input\".  Half the time if I start a movie regardless of source or mode the image will start to flash and jump all over the screen.  The only resolution is to shut down and restart the screen. I now have the PS3 direct connect because it wouldn't see it at all half the time, haven't noticed all that much difference since I went to direct connect.  LG's \"Tech Support\" is a joke and they just pretty much say it's my fault.  I am using the highest quality HDMI cables so that isn't the issue.
